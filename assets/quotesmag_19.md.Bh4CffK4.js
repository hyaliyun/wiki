This project involved the partial or complete reconstruction of three major thoroughfares in the northern and eastern Twin Cities metropolitan area, which include Interstate 35W (I-35W), US Highway 10, and I-694. Ramsey County Road 10 (CR 10) was also planned to be partially reconstructed at the intersection with I-35W during this project as well. Several other side projects that tie into this reconstruction include the expansion of the Lexington Avenue bridge in Arden Hills, as well as the reconstruction of the Island Lake overpasses just west of Victoria Street in Shoreview. Cities and communities that are involved with this project include New Brighton, Mounds View, Arden Hills, Shoreview, Little Canada, and Vadnais Heights, Minnesota. Construction on the North Central Corridor project began the week of September 19, 2011. Work is expected to be completed in November 2013, at an estimated cost of $185.5 million. ==Project background== Road grading involved in constructing the original Highway 100 (I-694)/US 10/MN 51 interchange was approved in 1956, with actual road construction beginning in 1959. The bridges that span the project area were built in 1960, 1961, and 1962, respectively. The first section of Interstate 694 opened to traffic between Interstate 35E and Rice Street in 1961, and the remainder of I-694, I-35W, and US 10, were opened to traffic later in the 1960s and 1970s. Projects to expand I-694 between I-94 and I-35W were completed during the late part of the 1980s. Since then, the Unweave the Weave project (completed in 2008) has been the only major construction activity that has taken place on I-694 other than routine maintenance. Currently, I-694 provides for a minimum of two through lanes of traffic each direction both east and west of the I-694/US 10/MN 51 interchange. The area between I-35W and I-35E, however, is only a total of four lanes wide, with just one lane of through traffic provided for commuters on I-694 at the interchange. This lane configuration, combined with increased traffic volume and congestion over time, makes the interchange one of the worst places for bottlenecks in the Twin Cities. Traffic data, collected as of 2000, noted that approximately 102,000 vehicles travel through this stretch of I-694 on a daily basis. Based on this data, this number is expected to increase to 148,000 by the year 2030. The interchange also experiences an average of two hours of congestion during both the morning and afternoon rush hour periods. One of the key objectives of this project is to allow for I-694 to be a continuous six-lane freeway from the junction with I-494 in Maple Grove to the junction with I-94 in Oakdale. ==Project objectives and design goals== The I-35W/US 10/I-694 North Central Corridor Reconstruction Project aims to accomplish the following design aspects and project goals: * Eliminate geometric deficiencies (traffic weaving) at the I-694/US 10/MN 51 interchange, including removal of the Hamline Avenue exit and left-hand entrances at Hamline Avenue and MN 51. Construction will be staged to allow two lanes of traffic to remain open in each direction throughout reconstruction of the interchange. * Increase traffic capacity by providing additional through lanes in each direction of I-694. * Allow I-694 to be a continuous six-lane highway, both east and west of I-35W. * Replace structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges throughout project area. Most of the bridge structures throughout the I-694/US 10/MN 51 project area received a structural evaluation score of 5 or 6, classifying them as being close to structurally deficient. Other bridges are scheduled for replacement on I-35W, and on MN 51, as noted below: **The CR 10 bridges spanning I-35W are scheduled for replacement beginning in June 2012, and will be completed by the end of October 2012. **The CR 96 bridge spanning I-35W was scheduled to be repaired in 2014. (MnDOT is only planning to replace the bridge deck and superstructure components of the CR 96 bridge.) **The CR H bridge spanning I-35W is scheduled for replacement in 2015. **The CR F (Valentine Lake Road) bridge spanning I-35W is scheduled for replacement in 2016. **The CR E2 bridge spanning I-35W is scheduled for replacement in 2016. **The CR E bridge spanning MN 51 (Snelling Avenue) is scheduled for replacement in 2015. * Expand or reconstruct overpasses and ramps on I-694 at Rice Street, Victoria Street, and Lexington Avenue. Two of these overpasses include the Island Lake channel bridges that span Island Lake, just west of Victoria Street, in Shoreview. * Reconstruct the I-35W interchange at I-694. Current draft plans show this interchange with two flyover ramps on the NE and SW corners of the interchange. * Resurface the roadway on US 10 between I-694 and I-35W. * Construct a partial diamond interchange on US 10 at CR 96 in Arden Hills. The current configuration of this interchange is an at-grade intersection; future plan is to build an overpass on CR 96 to span US 10\\\\. This construction is planned for March 2013 – September 2013. ==Construction breakdown== Initial design plans for the North Central Corridor Reconstruction Project were drawn in 2007. These plans included expanding I-694 to a total of eight lanes wide (four each direction), but a lack of funding forced these plans to be scaled back to a six-lane freeway (three in each direction). After several revisions, final design plans were signed in November 2010. Preparations for construction took place in the months preceding September 2011. ===2011=== Construction officially commenced on September 19, 2011. Work started on I-694 with grading inside the median west of US 10 to make way for new permanent pavement between I-35W and US 10\\\\. On October 2, southbound Hamline Avenue was closed to traffic at CR F. MnDOT also permanently closed the ramp from southbound Hamline Avenue to eastbound I-694. During the weekend of October 7, the eastbound I-694 bridge spanning Old US 10 (currently signed as CR 76) was demolished. Beams for the new bridge were put into place on November 8. MnDOT demolished the ramp from southbound Hamline Avenue to eastbound I-694 on October 14. This involved closing off the westbound side of I-694 for one weekend while the parent demolition of the southbound Hamline Avenue bridge over westbound I-694 took place. The 2011 construction season came to a close on November 8, 2011. ===2012=== Activity for the 2012 construction season resumed the week of March 18. Lexington Avenue Bridge Expansion Work on the expansion of the Lexington Avenue bridge began on May 7. The bridge was expanded to increase traffic flow by converting to dual left turn lanes for both directions of I-694, update the traffic signaling system, and allow for a bicycle/pedestrian lane on the east side of the bridge. Work on the southbound half of the bridge was completed on May 17. The northbound (east) side of the bridge was reconstructed during the month of June, and all work on the bridge was completed in mid-July. Interstate 35W/CR 10/US 10 Interchange Reconstruction On June 8, MnDOT closed I-35W in both directions between I-694 and the northern junction of US 10 for removal of the bridges at the southern junction of US 10/CR 10. On September 20, crews opened the reconstructed bridge spans to cross traffic (all on- and off-ramps had remained closed up to this point). Work completed on October 26 with the reopening of the ramps from northbound I-35W to westbound CR 10, and from southbound I-35W to eastbound US 10. Interstate 694/MN 51/Hamline Avenue Interchange Reconstruction MnDOT closed the ramp from northbound MN 51 to westbound I-694 on April 2. MN 51 at the time was open as far north as CR E, with access limited to local traffic at Grey Fox Road in Arden Hills. Conversely, Hamline Avenue was closed south of CR F. The loop ramp from northbound MN 51 to westbound I-694 opened to traffic the week of November 15, 2012. The other loop ramp from northbound MN 51 to westbound US 10 will reopen during the 2013 construction season. Also, MN 51 and Hamline Avenue reopened in both directions (northbound and southbound) at I-694 as of November 15. The ramp from westbound I-694 to northbound Hamline Avenue was permanently closed on April 10. To access Hamline Avenue, motorists must now exit at Lexington Avenue and proceed westbound on CR F. On May 14, MnDOT closed the ramp from eastbound I-694 to southbound MN 51 for reconstruction. Eastbound US 10 from CR 96 to eastbound I-694 was also closed on May 14. The ramp to southbound MN 51 reopened during the week of November 15; eastbound US 10 south of CR 96 remains closed through spring of 2013. The intersection of Hamline Avenue at CR F was closed to traffic October 1. This allowed workers to install the wiring and other components for a new traffic signal that will be installed in the spring of 2013. Island Lake Bridge Reconstruction Sheet pile installation took place in the weeks leading up to April 1 in preparation for work on two new bridges that would span Island Lake in Shoreview. Sheet piling was used in this project to minimize environmental impacts from construction work and acted as a barrier between the construction area and the clean area of the lake. Because of the sheet pile installation and the nature of the remainder of the bridge work, boat traffic was halted until the majority of the bridge work was completed. Work started with the reconstruction of the westbound span, which went through early August. The Victoria Street ramp to westbound I-694 was closed from June 8 through August 20 as the westbound bridge span was completed. Work then continued on the eastbound span in mid- August. The ramp from eastbound I-694 to Victoria Street was closed on August 22. Crews poured the bridge deck on the eastbound span September 22. The ramp to Victoria Street was reopened on October 14, 2012. ===2017=== The project was completed with the finishing of the Arden hills portion by November 2017.I-694 Project in Arden Hills.

In the 1890s the McRae Brothers owned the station and had 32 Aboriginal men, 38 women and 13 children who were used as a source of labour. The station employees were given a new set of clothes every year in lieu of pay and were allowed to hunt native game, but only in their own time. The station suffered the loss of 800 sheep following a storm and resulting floods in 1894. Another storm swept over the area in 1898 causing even more damage. D. MacRae reported damage to the homestead and other buildings and waters rising to within of the 1894 watermark. No stock losses occurred with livestock being removed from the most affected paddocks the day before. of rain fell over the course of a day. Ernest Anderton Hall (nephew of William Shakespeare Hall) bought Croydon sometime before 1915, after he sold Yandayarra Station, and Croydon was managed by his cousin Harold Aubrey Hall. Ernest Hall also eventually acquired Sherlock Station, and later sold Croydon to James Nicholas. Croydon was advertised in 1919 when Nicholas, sold three properties in the northwest; Croydon, Peron Peninsula and Dirk Hartog Stations. At the time Croydon occupied an area of and was stocked with 11,000 sheep and 2,700 cattle. By 1925 the station was owned by Clarence G. Meares. In 1928 the station was up for sale and occupied an area of with a lease that expired in 1948 and costing the owner £1 per 1000 acre. At this stage approximately were fenced and the station was sub-divided into 14 paddocks. The station is well watered and has the Sherlock River running for about through the property including about 20 permanent pools. Additionally the station had a tleast 14 wells equipped with windmills. The station was running 20,000 sheep, 600 cattle, 50 horses, a donkey and camel team as well as the usual station plant. The station was sold after the deaths of both Duncan McRae and Samuel Peter Mackay. The station received 60 breeding rams in 1939 which arrived in Roebourne aboard the Koolinda. In 1947 the station manager, Mr John Minson, was seriously injured when his horse tripped an fell on him as he was out mustering. He taken back to the homestead on horseback, then to Whim Creek by truck and then taken by flying doctors to Port Hedland. The station was owned in 2008 by Peter Cook, a pharmacist, who owned other properties in the Pilbara including Hooley, Mallina, Pyramid and Sherlock Stations. ==See also== *List of ranches and stations ==References== Category:Pastoral leases in Western Australia Category:Pilbara Category:Stations (Australian agriculture) Category:1878 establishments in Australia ","title":"Croydon Station"},{"id":"35942002","text":"The 2012 German Darts Championship was the second of five PDC European Tour events on the 2012 PDC Pro Tour.

He is the current President of Bankia, a position he has held since 2012. He served as President and COO of BBVA from 2001 to 2009. == Career == Goirigolzarri earned a bachelor's degree in Economics and Business Studies from the University of Deusto (Bilbao), and a degree in Strategic Finance and Planning from the University of Leeds. He began his professional career at Banco de Bilbao in 1977. In 1992, he was appointed as General Director at BBV. In 1999, BBV and Argentaria merged and Goirigolzarri was appointed as member of the Management Committee and head of the Latin- American businesses. He served as Vice Chairman of Telefónica and Repsol in 2002-2003. Goirigolzarri was President and COO of BBVA from 2001 to 2009, when he early-retired after working at the bank for 30 years. He received a lifelong pension of €3 million per year (starting from age 65), which caused an avalanche of public criticism. On 9 May 2012, he became the president of Bankia, the fourth largest bank of Spain.http://www.bankia.com/page/id-2-1304-0-99634-427526-99633-0%24P2%3D*__rp1304-99633-99253_p*2*__rp1304-99633-99253_form- submit*true.go On 25 May 2012, Bankia asked for €19 billion from the FROB, the Spanish bailout fund for banks. Bankia also revised its earnings statement for 2011, stating that instead of a profit of €309 million, it had in fact lost €4.3 billion before taxes. A number of limitations were imposed as a result of having received state aid. Shareholders had to share part of the burden of the capital injection, the balance sheet had to be reduced, dividends were restricted until 2014, and both the branch network (-39%) and workforce (-28%) had to be reduced. At the end of 2015, Bankia had fulfilled two years ahead of schedule all the targets set by the European Commission in the BFA-Bankia Group Restructuring Plan. The bank also reported the best efficiency, solvency and profitability among the six largest Spanish banks. In 2016, Goirigolzarri was listed on the tenth place in the MERCO ranking of best Spanish business leaders. In 2017, he was listed seventh. He is Board Chairman of Deusto Business School. His hobbies are walking in the mountains and reading. == Political and economic views  Education === In an article in October 2010, Goirigolzarri warned about the state of education in Spain. He noted that Spain has a high percentage (35%) of people that haven't finished high school, and also a very high percentage of university students. The intermediate group is significantly lower than in other countries. He also noted that university degrees do not fit the demand of the economy, and that no Spanish university was ranked among the top 200 universities in the world (excluding private business schools). As a reason for the lack of changes in education, he stated that educational changes do not have an effect in the short term, are politically complex and go beyond electoral periods. So they are politically unattractive. “Although the improvement of the educational system is the most important variable for a country's productivity, for its competitiveness and, consequently, for wealth creation, the reality is that it has no priority on the political agenda. This should not lead us to discouragement, but on the contrary, to an energetic and committed approach, because on education depends our future, and that of our children.” === Financial crisis === In an article in November 2010, he stated that the financial crisis in Spain had been above all a crisis of over-indebtedness. \\"It is worth remembering how two years ago the mantra of some politicians was that it was necessary to increase lending volumes to maintain activity (in fact, in some countries public aid was linked to that goal). That noise has gradually disappeared... Because it did not make sense. Never have you ever left a crisis of over-indebtedness, increasing leverage.\\" === Public banks === In June 2016, Goirigolzarri responded to Podemos, after the party said that it wanted to keep Bankia as a public entity. He stated, \\"I do not know any public banks that have worked\\". He recalled that when he entered Bankia four years ago, what he found was a concept of public banking that had to be rescued. He also said that the board of the entity was then formed by \\"politicians, employers and trade unions, and everyone knows where that model took us.\\" == References == Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bilbao Category:University of Deusto alumni Category:Alumni of the University of Leeds Category:Spanish economists Category:Spanish bankers Category:Directors of Bankia ","title":"José Ignacio Goirigolzarri"},{"id":"35942038","text":"van der Hoop may refer to: *Adriaan van der Hoop (1778-1854), Dutch banker and art collector whose collection laid the basis for the Rijksmuseum *Joan Cornelis van der Hoop (1742-1825), Dutch lawyer and politician, father of Adriaan (1778-1854) *Johannes Hermanus van der Hoop (1887-1950), Dutch psychiatrist Category:Surnames of Dutch origin ","title":"Van der Hoop"},{"id":"35942045","text":"William St George Nugent, 10th Earl of Westmeath, (28 November 1832 – 31 May 1883), styled Lord Delvin from 1871 to 1879, was an Anglo-Irish peer.

He also writes a twice-weekly op-ed column for The New York Times and a blog named for his 2007 book The Conscience of a Liberal as well as teaches economics at Princeton University. The book is intended for a general audience and was published by W. W. Norton & Company in April 2012. Krugman has presented his book at the London School of Economics, on fora.tv, and elsewhere. Previous books include The Accidental Theorist, The Conscience of a Liberal, Fuzzy Math, The Great Unraveling, Peddling Prosperity, and two editions of The Return of Depression Economics (both editions being national bestsellers). ==Premises of the book== President Barack Obama announces the creation of the Economic Recovery Advisory Board on February 6, 2009. Krugman states explicitly in the early sections of the book, The author views the book as delivering a call for stimulative expansionary policy and an end to austerity. It points out that existing historical economic data demonstrate: fiscal cuts and austerity measures just deprive the economy of precious funds that can circulate and add to a poor economy. If there is large unemployment, there cannot be sufficient consumption. Under poor consumption people are unable to spend and markets cannot thrive. Krugman disputes that although it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst moment to do so at the time when an economy has just suffered severe financial shocks. It must be done when an economy is full-employed and the private sector can endure the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy by public or private sectors will just unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse. Krugman writes about the anti- recession efforts from the Obama White House that he \\"personally was more or less tearing my hair out in public as the shape of the administration's plan began to come clear.\\" He describes having \\"feared that an inadequate stimulus would both fail to produce adequate recovery and undermine the political case for further action\\", with the enacted Recovery and Reinvestment Act being far too small to respond to the depth of the economic crisis in his view. He cites the growth of government spending and economic regulations as the U.S. began in its involvement in World War II as key evidence for his argument. He writes, \\"As military spending created jobs and family incomes rose, consumer spending also picked up (it would eventually be restrained by rationing, but that came later). As businesses saw their sales growing, they also responded by ramping up spending. And just like that, the Depression was over.\\" ==Reviews== Kirkus Reviews published a positive review saying that Krugman \\"delivers an urgent message on ending the economic crisis.\\" The group's review also referred to the book as an \\"important contribution to the current study of economics and a reason for hope that effective solutions will be implemented again.\\" The Ludwig von Mises Institute published a highly critical review in its online journal Mises Daily by David Gordon. Gordon wrote, \\"The government under Bush and Obama has spent a great deal of money; but, on Krugman's own showing, the economy has failed fully to recover. Does this not give us some reason to think that the Keynesian prescription is inadequate?\\" He stated that Krugman makes a 'heads I win, tails you lose' argument in which Krugman credits instances that government spending seems to stop economic malaise while instances when government spending seems to fail get hand-waived away since Krugman believes even greater spending would have worked. ==See also== *2008–2012 global recession *American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 *Financial crisis of 2007–2008 *Keynesian economics *The New New Deal ==ReferencesExternal links== * * * Category:2012 non-fiction books Category:Books by Paul Krugman Category:Finance books Category:W.

The three games tell the story of an attempt to invade Earth by a race of supernatural shadow people and a collection of protagonists who must survive the attacks and fight against them. The origins of the creatures and their motives are detailed in the prequel, One Night 2: The Beyond, while the first and third games deal with subsequent invasion attempts and the conclusion to the conflict. The games feature gameplay that is fairly typical of the survival horror genre. The player advances by moving through the games' locations collecting items and solving puzzles. While exploring, the player will often encounter traps or enemies, which they can either engage in combat with or avoid entirely. As supplies such as health packs and ammunition are generally scarce, the player is encouraged to use caution and avoid getting trapped by enemies. Each of the three games also features multiple endings; different outcomes will be unlocked depending on the player's actions during gameplay, though not all of the possible endings are considered canon. ==One Night== One Night is the first game in the series, released in January 2009.Gamespot Game Profile (One Night) It takes place in July 2012 and follows an amnesiac CIA agent named Colt, who awakens in a crumbling research facility infested by otherworldly monsters. He eventually teams up with another surviving agent and together they discover that the facility administrator sabotaged an experiment in the facility, causing it to be swallowed up in an inter-dimensional portal and \\"merge\\" with another universe, which has resulted in most of the facility's staff turning into monsters. Ultimately, Colt reverses the \\"merge\\" and returns the facility to normality, allowing him to escape, though it is unclear who manipulated the facility administrator to cause the \\"merge\\" and why. This loose end is explored in the third game, which is a direct sequel. Depending on how they played, the player can receive one of three endings, where Colt survives alongside one, both, or none of the facility's other survivors. ==One Night 2: The Beyond== One Night 2: The Beyond, released six months following the first game,Gamespot Game Profile (One Night 2) takes place two decades earlier, in July 1987. Players take control of one of two selectable protagonists (a detective, John Faraday or a writer, Sara Wickson) as they become trapped in a supposedly haunted mansion named \\"The Beyond\\" and must try to survive the night. Eventually, the chosen protagonist discovers that the mansion was built on top of a series of old coal mines wherein a construction of extraterrestrial origin has been buried since the late Bronze Age. The beings within the construction, known as \\"shadow people\\", who possess psychokinetic powers, have been driven from their own world due to war and have fled to Earth, which they plan to conquer. However, their journey to Earth has weakened them and they have remained in suspended animation underneath the mansion for thousands of years, awakening in the mid-20th Century to regain their powers by slowly bringing the mansion and the surrounding countryside under their control. By the point of the game's beginning, they have almost regained full power, and, after uncovering their back story and unlocking the way to the mines, the game's protagonist defeats them, reducing their power to almost nothing once again and releasing the house from their control. The game features four different endings that the player can achieve based on their performance, with two available for each of the selectable characters. One Night 2 is notably different from the previous game in tone and gameplay, with a noticeable emphasis on exploration rather than combat and a much darker atmosphere. ==One Night: Full Circle== One Night: Full Circle is the third and final game in the One Night Trilogy, released more than two years after the original game in April 2011.Gamespot Game Profile (One Night: Full Circle) It takes place seven years after the original game, in 2019. The protagonist of One Night: Full Circle is Tom Hawkin, who travels to the town of Stillwater to search for a missing relative, only to find it abandoned and infested with monsters and shadow people. In Stillwater, he meets Colt, the protagonist of One Night who has also been drawn to the town, and the two team up to discover what has happened to the town and how it is connected to the events of the previous games. In the course of exploring the town, Tom and Colt learn that following their defeat at the end of the second game, the shadow people left \\"The Beyond\\" behind to find other ways to regain their lost power. Seeking to create an influx of negative energy to reinvigorate them, they placed John Faraday (one of the protagonists of One Night 2) under their control and used him to blackmail a government researcher, leading to the events of One Night. As they were foiled by Colt, they were once again left powerless, and the catastrophe that has befallen Stillwater is yet another attempt to rupture the fabric of reality and gather more power. Full Circle covers the shadow people's final attempt to control humanity and, depending on decisions made by the player during the game, they either succeed or fail in one of two different endings. ==Critical reception== Since their release in the RPG Maker community, the three games have generated considerable popularity. The third game was featured in the October 2011 issue of PC Gamer in the United States, where it was listed as an \\"adorable top down horror game\\".PC Gamer, October 2011, \\"One Night: Full Circle\\" in \\"Level Up\\" An earlier version of the game also appeared in the magazine in February 2011, where it was commended for \\"turning survival horror into something that can be idly enjoyed in the afternoon\\", though with criticism given to its writing a narrative.\\"The top five RPG Maker games\\" PC Gamer Online, February 26, 2011 Within the RPG Maker community, the series has been stated as \\"ranking up there with some of the better games from the RPG Maker scene\\" by Sore Losers Gaming, an RPG Maker developer's blog.\\"One Night 2: The Beyond\\" on Sore Losers Blog.

The name of the genus meaning \\"Duke dog\\", for Duke University and the Greek word cynos, dog, for the pretended similarity of this animal with dogs. A single species known so far, Dukecynus magnus. The species name \\"magnus\\" derives from Latin for big, to reflect their great size. == Description == Dukecynus is only known from its holotype, IGM 251149, a heavily damaged partial skull preserving parts of the lower and upper jaw as well as associated fragments of the skeleton. This specimen was discovered at the Konzentrat-Lagerstätte La Venta in the Honda Group, Huila and Tolima in Colombia. A second fragmentary specimen from La Venta, cataloged as UCMP 39250, consisting of a fragmentary skull and parts of the humerus and femur from a juvenile individual, referred to \\"cf. Arctodictis\\" by Marshall (1978) could also belong to Dukecynus or a similar species.Marshall, L. Evolution of the Borhyaenidae, extinct South American predaceous marsupials. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978. Although the affinities of this species have never been formally analysed, Dukecynus is generally considered to be a basal borhyaenoid, a paraphyletic group of sparassodonts that includes genera like Lycopsis and Prothylacynus that cannot be assigned to one of the major borhyaenoid families like Borhyaenidae or Thylacosmilidae. Compared to other basal borhyaenoids, Dukecynus had a long, narrow snout and was relatively large, with some estimates suggesting this animal weighed up to 68 kilograms (150 lbs).Stephen Wroe, Christine Argot and Christopher Dickman.

He is considered one of Austria-Hungary's greatest academic painters in the second half of the 19th century. His most famous and recognizable paintings include Death of Gül Baba, Battle of Zenta, Slave trade and Cock fighting and many other, depicting mostly motifs from the Orient. His works can be found in many European museums across the continent. ==Biography== Franz Eisenhut was born in Nova Palanka, Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar, Austrian Empire (today Bačka Palanka, Vojvodina province, Serbia) in a German family. His father, Georg Eisenhut was from Palanka, and his mother Theresia Sommer was from Bukin. His father had hoped for Franz to become a merchant, but the Hungarian painter Telepy Károly discovered his talent for painting. Influential citizens of Palanka at the time, led by lawyer Karl Mezey and pharmacist Karlo Harliković, collected money for his studies. He studied at Hungarian Royal Drawing School in Budapest from 1875 until 1877. Afterwards, he became a student of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. He studied there until 1883 in class of Gyula Benczúr, the Hungarian painter. After finishing the Academy, he went on a trip to the Orient for the first time, visiting the Caucasus. The next year, he held his first exhibition in Budapest. The Orient became his main source of inspiration and Orientalist paintings will become his most famous works. In 1883 and 1884, he went to the Caucasus once again, visiting Tbilisi and Baku. In 1886 and 1887, he traveled from Naples to Tunisia and Algeria. His first great success was the 1886 painting \\"Healing through the Koran in Beirut\\". Battle of Zenta (detail, 1896) Many of his paintings were reproduced by woodcutting workshops across Europe, because, as his friend Lyka Karoly claimed, \\"his paintings showed the authentic Orient\\". Lyka Karoly also gave a detailed description of Eisenhut's studio in Munich, which was located at Mozartstrasse 13/4. Another famous painting made at the time was Death of Gül Baba, for which he won the State Gold Medal at an exhibition in Budapest. Afterwards, he had exhibitions in Munich, Paris and Madrid. In 1894, he painted the interior of New York Palace in Budapest. Franz Eisenhut's most famous work is the painting \\"Battle of Zenta\\", made in 1896 for the Hungarian Millennium Exhibition, celebrating 1000 years since the Hungarian settlement in the Great Hungarian Plain. The painting was ordered by the Bács-Bodrog County and is still exhibited in Sombor City Hall, as Sombor was the county seat at the time. This painting, with dimensions of 7x4 meters, is the largest oil painting in the Balkans today. In 1897, he returned to Palanka, where he married Adriana Reichl, daughter of Friedrich Reichl, owner of the Reichl cement factory in Neu-Palanka and brother of the famous architect from Apatin. Franz Reichl. In 1898 they had a daughter, who died soon afterwards on their journey to Samarkand, when the family was returning from Emirate of Bukhara. Eisenhut was invited to Bukhara personally by the Emir 'Abd al-Ahad Khan. In 1901, their second daughter Judith was born, and in 1903, his only son Franz Georg, who was later the founder of leather industry Merkur in Bačka Palanka. However, Franz got seriously ill while in Munich and died on 2 June 1903. He was buried in the Ostfriedhof cemetery in Munich. A street in Palanka was named \\"Eisenhutgasse\\" after him. ==External links== Category:1857 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Academy of Fine Arts, Munich alumni Category:Austrian male painters Category:Bačka Palanka Category:Burials at the Ostfriedhof (Munich) Category:Danube-Swabian people Category:German diaspora in Europe Category:History of Bačka Category:Hungarian University of Fine Arts alumni Category:Orientalism Category:Orientalist painters Category:Realist painters Category:19th-century Austrian painters Category:19th-century male artists Category:20th-century Austrian painters Category:20th-century male artists ","title":"Franz Eisenhut"},{"id":"35942441","text":"Russell Holland is a Grand Prix motorcycle racer from Australia. ==Career statisticsBy season=== { !Season !Class !Motorcycle !Race !Win !Podium !Pole !FLap !Pts !Plcd - align=\\"right\\" !  250cc  Yamaha  1  0  0  0  0  0  NC - align=\\"right\\" !

These states were usually, but not always, sovereign Imperial States. == Imperial commissions == The Aulic Council was entitled to delegate its authority to an \\"imperial commission\\". Such a commission could be tasked to deal with all subject matter for which the Aulic Council itself was responsible. In about three quarters of all cases, the Council did this at the request of one of the parties in a case before the Council. To what extent the Council used commissions has not yet been exhaustively researched. This is partly due to the fact that Council would often delegate organizational matters to an imperial commission, such as regulating an inheritance of guardianship. Only a small subset of the imperial commissions were used to resolve legal disputes. During the reign of Emperor Ferdinand III, 650 such commissions were documented. In over 70 cases, the Council rejected a request to create an imperial commission.Eva Ortlieb: Reichshofrat und Kaiserliche Kommissionen in der Regierungszeit Kaiser Ferdinand III., p. 54-56 The commission would be established by an imperial patent, based on a decision by the Aulic Council. Formally, the commission would act on behalf of the Emperor. A commission would consist of one or more members. Usually they would be selected on the basis of geographical proximity to the parties, and would be members of the same Imperial Circle. In the early days, meticulous attention was paid to the religious affiliation of the commissioners. Parties could object to the creation of a commission or the selection of its members, if, for example, they were perceive to be biased. The Aulic Council would rule on such objections. A few states (for example, the imperial city of Regensburg) had a privilege granted by Emperor Charles V, exempting them from the commissions system. === Competencies === Various different tasks could be assigned to an imperial commissions. Some commissions were only tasked with an inquiry; others were charged with the implementation of various measures. If a legel decision had to be made, the Aulic Council would usually make it, although sometimes the council would appoint a \\"deciding judge\\" or a \\"deciding commission, who were authorized to make legal decisions. The imperial commission would usually try to find a compromise solution to resolve the conflict, and secure this compromise in a treaty between the parties. In extreme cases, the Emperor would permit the use of military force to support an imperial commission. === Topics === Some 80% of the plaintiffs and 90% of the defendants were immediate subjects of the Emperor. Cases dealt with by commissions spanned the full range of topics causing conflicts in the era. About one third of cases were family problems, mostly inheritance disputes. Another third were economic issues, and about 15% of cases were about sovereignty. A common issue was debt regulation and overindebtedness. Commissions dealing with debts were called debit commissions (). == Debit commissions == Johann Jakob Moser distinguishes three types of debit commissions depending on the order ideal types into three types. * Commissions of inquiry: tasked to determine the actual financial situation * Commissions of administration: tasked to carry out specific order specific measures to service debt * Bankruptcy commissions: tasked to carry out the formal bankruptcy procedure === Reasons for the indebtedness of the States === The reasons for states to be overindebted varies. Sometimes the cause was a war; sometimes a sovereign prince spent too much money to maintain a magnificent court; sometimes the cause was excessive military spending. Especially at the end of the Thirty Years' War, many sovereign princes were burdened with a heavy war debt: they had spent heavily during the war, and their revenues had dwindled. In later times, the more usual cause of payment was spending too much on the operation of the princely court. === Remit of the debit commissions=== Debit commissions were given their remit in writing. These letters were very, often using the exact some wording. The commissions were tasked to * Take control of the debtors civil servants, i.e. have them swear allegiance to the commission and take control over their hierarchy * Create a list of assets and liabilities * Agree an amicable payment plan with the creditors * Undertake measures to improve the debtor's ability to pay * Write a judgement and publish it === Priority of the debit commission === Debtors often requested the creation of the debit commission. One reason for this is that a debit commission was a \\"universal forum\\" in which all claims against this debtor would be considered. The commission could set aside judgements passed against the debtor in other courts. All existing debts became responsibilities of the debit commission, who would treat all creditors equitably and fairly. === Bankruptcy proceedings === In bankruptcy proceedings, the Commission could arrange security measures and appoint a property manager. In the first phase of a bankruptcy, there was a public call for creditors to file their claims. The claims were verified and, if found valid, declared \\"liquid\\", i.e. legitimate and enforceable. In the next phase, the claims were prioritized and available funds were divided among the creditors accordingly. == Legal basis == Imperial debit commissions were regulated by the Aulic Regulations.For example: Aulic order (RHRO) of 16 March 1654, Title II, § 6 The Reichskammergericht had competencies overlapping those of the Aulic Council and also had the ability to set up commissions. However, the Reichskammergericht was not authorized to deal with bankruptcy cases. When the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806, the legal basis for the imperial debit commissions ceased to exist. However, in many cases, the commissions renamed themselves from \\"imperial debit commission\\" to simply \\"debit commission\\" and continued their work. For example, the commission set up in 1769 to deal with Saxe-Hildburghausen, was active until 1826.Wolfgang Burgdorf: Am Schuldenwesen kann man genesen, in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of 12 July 2011, p. 37, OnlineArchive portal Thuringia: Kaiserliche Debitkommission für Sachsen-Hildburghausen == References == * Eva Ortlieb: Reichshofrat und Kaiserliche Kommissionen in der Regierungszeit Kaiser Ferdinand III.

Based on the oldest transcriptions of the name, it can be derived from *Salbotin, based on the Latin personal name Salvus (literally, 'healthy'). Another possibility (assuming that the old transcriptions are wrong) is that the name was originally Sabotin, based on the Italian name Sàb(b)ato, originally given to a child born on a Saturday. A third possibility is that it is derived from *San Valentin (there is a church dedicated to Saint Valentine on the mountain) through a number of unexpected phonological changes. ==History== Sabotin represented an important defence point defending Gorizia during the Soča/Isonzo offensives. It was defended by the Austro-Hungarian 58th division. Pietro Badoglio assigned general Giuseppe Venturi's 45th division to capture Sabotin in the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo.

It is in the historic St James Square neighbourhood, within the Medieval town walls. While the house currently has an attractive, 18th-century facade, it originated as a burgage tenement. In addition, behind the house, evidence of a kiln has been unearthed, with both Medieval and Post-medieval pottery. In 2010, archaeological excavation in the square revealed the first evidence of Mesolithic human settlement in Monmouth. Recent residents of St James House have included boarding students from Monmouth School. ==Neighbourhood and location== View from southwest side of St James Square with Monmouth War Memorial, installed 1921, and Indian Bean Tree, planted c. 1900 and the Old Nag's Head beyond. 33 Whitecross Street (far left), St James House (right), and Public Library (centre) 1610 map of Monmouth by John Speed with East Gate (Dixton Gate) marked M, and cross \\"There are some lovely spots in the town centre, none prettier than St James's Square, with its old war memorial in the shadow of a romantic-looking tree.\\" This is the description of St James Square (pictured) in Monmouth, Wales that appeared in The Telegraph of 25 February 2006. The war memorial mentioned is the Monmouth War Memorial that was installed in the square in 1921 and was the work of sculptor W. Clarke of Llandaff. The \\"romantic-looking tree\\" is a reference to the Catalpa or Indian Bean Tree that was planted on the square in about 1900. St James House (pictured) is located at the eastern end of Whitecross Street, where it terminates at the roundabout encircling the triangular St James Square. The building is positioned on the north side of the square, across from 33 Whitecross Street (pictured), the site of archaeological excavation in 2009. St James House lies within the Medieval town walls which were built around 1300. On the 1610 map of Monmouth (pictured below) by cartographer John Speed, the area which served as the site for St James House is depicted adjacent to the label for the East Gate (Dixton Gate). However, as discussed by author William Meyler Warlow, the square, as well as the road south of it, including the future St James Street and Almshouse Street, were all considered to be part of Whitecross Street during the early 17th century. A white cross, which gave its name to the street, stood in the square (see map). As is the case with some other houses on the eastern leg of Whitecross Street, St James House has had two addresses: 10 St James Square and 10 Whitecross Street. ==Design and burgage history== St James House was grade II listed on 27 June 1952. The listed building has an 18th-century facade with a three-storey, five-bay elevation. The exterior is red brick, highlighted by light-colored, raised stone quoins which serve as the cornerstones of the walls, contrasting with the brick. Decorative keystones of similar material are atop all of the windows except one, which is lugged and scrolled. The bays on the ground and first floors are rectangular, while those on the uppermost floor are square. The exception is the tall, centre window on the first floor which is round- headed. The centrally-positioned entrance features a wood portico supported by Doric columns. A fanlight is present above the door. The roof is flared and hipped. The interior has a small amount of 17th-century plasterwork. St James House is considered to be a good representation of the burgage tenements that were common during Medieval times (link to glossary below). Its origins as a burgage are most evident at the rear of the property. The current, 18th- century facade was a later addition. Burgage tenements were rental properties that were often long and narrow plots of land, particularly in towns where frontage property along a street was at a premium. The gable (narrow) end of a house on a burgage plot usually faced the street. The classical style was in vogue during the 18th century, the consequence of which was that many burgage houses received new brick facades. Such was the case with St James House. ==Archaeology== Important archaeological finds have been excavated both at St James House and its neighbourhood. Behind St James House, evidence of a Post- medieval pottery kiln has been unearthed. The kiln at St James House produced Welsh Borderland ceramics of the A7d type. Other Monmouthshire 17th-century kilns which produced this pottery included Abergavenny and Trefaldu at Cwmcarvan. A few sources of A7d pottery have been located outside of Monmouthshire as well, including Herefordshire. In addition, a base sherd of Spanish ware excavated by Socket in 1956 at St James House was found to be Medieval, of the early 15th century. On 8 November 2010, the BBC News reported that during the course of gas main replacement work at St James Square and Wyebridge Street, Mesolithic era artefacts, including flints, were excavated (link to photograph of flints below). An article by Sion Morgan of the Western Mail which also ran on 8 Nov 2010 in Wales Online suggested that similar artefacts were found in St James Street as well. This represented the first discovery of Mesolithic human settlement in Monmouth. ==Residents of St James House== In 1891, Chippenham House, a grade II listed building at 102 Monnow Street, was home to surgeon Thomas Gilbert Prosser (1856–1932), a native of Monmouth. However, the doctor lived at St James House on Whitecross Street in 1901 and 1911. In Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire 1901, Part 2, he is listed as both a county and borough magistrate. In Part 3 of the directory, he is listed as a medical officer at the Hospital & Dispensary. Prosser, a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, died on 5 Nov 1932 in Monmouth. William Humphrey Williams (1880–1948), licensed by the Royal College of Physicians and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, followed in the footsteps of Prosser, with regard to both profession and residence. He passed his Anatomy and Physiology examinations of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons in July 1903 and, by 1911, he was living at Chippenham House. The following year, on 26 September 1912, he married Nesta Faith Green-Price, daughter of Sir Richard Dansey Green-Price and granddaughter of Sir Richard Green-Price, in Radnorshire. By 1923, Williams was the Medical Officer of Health for Monmouth and the Williams family resided at St James House. The physician was also medical officer for the Rockfield district and public vaccinator for the Monmouth district. In addition, Williams was medical officer for the Borough Fever Hospital. Williams and his wife lived at St James House prior to Williams' death on 2 March 1948 in Monmouth. Later, St James House served as a junior boarding house for boys ages ten to thirteen at Monmouth School. A J Jones was a housemaster at the St James House location. The Heart Project, a substantial renovation of Monmouth School, was undertaken in early 2011. As part of the first phase of that project, St James House was sold and its boarders were transferred to Chapel House, on the northern segment of Monk Street, in September 2011. The first phase also included redevelopment of The Grange from a prep school to a sixth form boarding house, which also opened in September 2011. The second phase of the school building project has begun. ==See also== * Monmouth School * St James Square, Monmouth * Whitecross Street, Monmouth * Monmouth in the Mesolithic period * Monmouth Town Walls and Defences ==ReferencesExternal links== * Medieval English Towns – Glossary * Photograph of Mesolithic flints found in St James Square * Monmouth School – The Heart Project Category:Houses in Monmouth, Wales Category:Archaeological sites in Monmouthshire Category:Cadw Category:Grade II listed buildings in Monmouthshire Category:Grade II listed houses in Wales ","title":"St James House, Monmouth"},{"id":"35942807","text":"Sickle Moon Peak or Bharanzar Peak () is located in the Kishtwar Himalaya and is the highest summit of the range.

The Brammah massif lies south of Sickle Moon and is separated by a 12 kilometer glacier. The nearest Peaks are Brahma I , Flat Top , Brahma II , and Arjuna , listed in order from west to east. ==Mountaineering== The east Kishtwar range of Brahma massif was first assessed by an Australian team in 1939. The eastern approaches of this Peak were explored by Fritz Kolb and his friends, the two Austrian mountaineers in 1947, from its base at Machail and climbed two small peeks. After a period of closure, the area was again open to foreigners in the early seventies, and there was a rush to climb the obvious plums in the western region. In 1973 British mountaineers Nick Escourt and Chris Bonington made an ascent of Brammah I (6416 m) and two years later in 1975 a team of Indian High Altitude Warfare School (HAWS) led by Lt. Col. D.

Since the election the UAP had lost two seats to the UCP in by-elections: Benambra on 15 October 1932, and Gunbower on 1 May 1934. On 16 May 1933, the UAP member for Waranga, Ernest Coyle, resigned from that party and defected to the UCP. James Vinton Smith was unendorsed by the UAP at the time of the 1932 election, and won the seat of Oakleigh as an Independent, but was fully endorsed by the party at the 1935 election. At the end of the Parliament, the United Australia Party held 29 seats (down from 31), the United Country Party held 19 seats (up from 16), and the ALP held 14 seats (unchanged). ==ResultsLegislative Assembly=== } Notes: *Twelve seats were uncontested at this election, and were retained by the incumbent parties: **UAP (4): Boroondara, Polwarth, Toorak, Upper Yarra **United Country (5): Benalla, Gippsland South, Goulburn Valley, Gunbower, Korong and Eaglehawk **Labor (2): Brunswick, Williamstown. **Independent (1): Port Fairy and Glenelg ==Subsequent events== The United Australia Party and the United Country Party had entered the election as a Coalition. The coalition won a comfortable majority, winning a total 44 seats in the 65 seat assembly. UAP leader Sir Stanley Argyle was confirmed as Premier, and formed what was known as the National Ministry, which included three members of the Country Party (Albert Dunstan, John Allan and George Goudie). On 5 March, rumours began to appear which suggested that the Country Party would demand a greater proportion of the ministry, including the Deputy Premiership, four of the eight full portfolios and at least one Honorary Minister, and it was suggested that they would challenge the UAP on the floor of the Assembly if this was not granted. On 15 March, the United Country Party overthrew leader Murray Bourchier, and replaced him with Albert Dunstan. On 19 March, a joint conference of the Country Party's central council and the parliamentary party voted in a secret ballot to discontinue the party's association with Argyle's National Ministry, and Dunstan, Allan and Goudie resigned from Argyle's cabinet the next day. At 10.30pm on Thursday 28 March, after a spirited sixteen-hour debate, Dunstan moved a motion of no confidence against Argyle's government. With the support of the Country Party, the Labor Party and three independents, the motion was carried on division by 40 votes to 23. Argyle informed the Governor of Victoria, Lord Huntingfield, of his ministry's resignation on 29 March. The Governor sought a meeting with Dunstan, but postponed the decision to commission him as Premier until the following Tuesday (2 April), due to his doubts about Dunstan's ability to form a stable ministry with Labor support. Dunstan was appointed Premier on 2 April 1935 and formed a minority Country Party government with Labor Party support in return for some legislative concessions. ==See also== *Candidates of the Victorian state election, 1935 *1934 Victorian Legislative Council election ==References== Category:1935 elections in Australia Category:Elections in Victoria (Australia) Category:1930s in Victoria (Australia) Category:March 1935 events ","title":"1935 Victorian state election"},{"id":"35942865","text":"The NLEX Road Warriors was a basketball team that played in the PBA Developmental League (PBA D-League) from 2011 to 2014.

The area was set out as gardens from around 1828 by Atkinson Francis Gibson and his wife Elizabeth. From 1838, his son Francis Gibson – who, as a Quaker, was interested in horticulture and had also completed a garden design for his sister – began creating a new garden with the help of a local nurseryman William Chater (breeder of Chater Hollyhocks).Buchan, U. (January 2019). Garden of friends. RHS: The Garden, 144(1), 30–34. Gibson considered the Dutch garden to be of utmost importance, and as such should be visible to visitors as they enter. The hedge maze (based upon the layout of the maze at Hampton Court Palace) was planted around 1870, and restored in 1984 with 11,000 yew seedlings, by which stage the garden was under the management of a local agent and was used as a venue for shows by the Saffron Walden horticultural society. The site opened to the public in 1902 and the borough council took over responsibility for its management from 1918, designating it as a 'public pleasure ground'. In 1987, the garden was listed with English Heritage. In the same year, the maze was replanted and the kitchen garden cleared. Between 2002 and 2006 the garden was restored back to the 1870 plan. The kitchen garden reopened between 2009 and 2011, and in 2015 introduced a visitors centre with toilets, designed to look like a converted toolshed.

They were ready to offer him a scholarship but he couldn't take it. Dame went into a depression over the next few weeks.

She was regarded as a prominent political voice with the New Democracy political party, her husband's government, and Greek politics. She was nicknamed \\"Mrs. Marika\\" among Greeks. ==BiographyPersonal life=== Mitsotakis was born to a prominent Athenian family on November 29, 1930. She contracted poliomyelitis at a swimming pool when she was seventeen years old. She survived the illness, but lived with a walking disability for the rest of her life. In addition to her political activities, Mitsotakis became an activist for people with disabilities in Greece. She married Konstantinos Mitsotakis, member of a political family from Crete, in 1953. The couple had four children: Dora, who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece from 2006 to 2009 and Mayor of Athens from 2003 until 2006, Alexandra, a civil-society activist, Katerina (Aikaterini) and Kyriakos, a member of the Hellenic Parliament from the New Democracy party who on 8 July 2019 became Prime Minister of Greece. Konstantinos served as the head of the New Democracy political party from 1984 to 1993. ===Political influence=== Mitsotakis served as the Spouse of the Prime Minister from 1990 to 1993 during her husband's tenure as head of government. She assumed the traditional role of the wife of a Prime Minister, being quoted in Time Magazine at the time of the 1990 election saying, \\"Finally, my Kostas, we’ve made it.\\" However, she was known for her political skills and outspokenness. In 1990, soon after taking office, Prime Minister Mitsotakis made his first appearance in the Greek parliament. A member of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) accused Marika of making \\"insolent gestures\\" towards socialist politicians during the session. Marika responded to the lawmaker's accusation, \\"I'll get my stick and beat you with it.\\" In 1991, Marika publicly criticized Minister of Industry Stavros Dimas. Dimas quickly resigned during an official trip to the Soviet Union as a result of Marika's criticism. Mitsotakis often defended her husband against political opponents. She also likened his calm political style and persona to the calming effect of Valium, telling a reporter, \\"If you chopped (him) into little pieces, you could sell him as Valium tablets.\\" Mitsotakis was widely regarded as an excellent cook in Greek political circles, leading to an urban legend that she used her culinary skills to influence politics. Political opponents of Konstantinos Mitsotakis accused her of using food to persuade two members of the Communist Party of Greece to join a 1989 coalition government with the conservatives with the purpose of pursuing corruption charges against Andreas Papandreou. Marika used the urban legend to write, publish and market her 2011 best-selling cookbook, Recipes With a Bit of History published in English in 2012 with the title Recipes of Love. Mitsotakis was hospitalized on April 17, 2012. She died at the Evgenidion Hospital in Athens on May 6, 2012, at the age of 81. She was survived by her husband and their four children, thirteen grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. == Venizelos/Mitsotakis family treeReferences== Category:1930 births Category:2012 deaths Category:New Democracy (Greece) politicians Category:Spouses of Prime Ministers of Greece Category:Women cookbook writers Category:Disability rights activists Category:People from Athens Category:People with polio Category:Mitsotakis family ","title":"Marika Mitsotakis"},{"id":"35942981","text":"Shorashim (, lit.

In the post-war era he led the development of the Decca Navigator System and the company's subsequent expansion to become a leader in maritime radar systems. He later worked for Plessey before becoming a managing director of British Telecommunications Research and then becoming deputy chairman of the General Post Office. He is also known as the recruiter of Arthur C Clarke as a radar technician during the war. ==Before the war== Fennessy was born in West Ham, Essex and educated at St Bonaventure's Grammar School in Forest Gate. His early academic career was not spectacular, and he graduated with a second-class degree from East London College in 1934. He had been active experimenting with electrical equipment starting at the age of 10, and this proved useful during the job hunt. He and Geoffrey Roberts joined Standard Telephones and Cables soon after graduation. Here he worked on \\"sound location amplifiers\\". ==War efforts== In 1937 Roberts was called to work with Robert Watson-Watt at Watt's secret radar development centre at Bawdsey Manor, Suffolk. He apparently called for Fennessy to join him, but Fennessy was initially rejected as unsuitable. As experimentation turned to development a need for engineers developed, and Fennessy was summoned to Bawdsey in 1938, shortly after marrying Marion Banks (died 1983), with whom he had two children. On 29 October 1938 Roberts and Fennessy made the now-famous \\"night dash\\" from Bawdsey to meet Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding on the opening night of the Munich Crisis. Explaining the problems co-ordinating the information from radar, and the edge this would give the RAF if this problem were addressed, the two convinced Dowding to set up the famous fighter operations room in a cellar at Fighter Command headquarters. All of this was completed in only 36 hours. At the time only five Chain Home stations were operational, a number Roberts considered barely functional, and Fennessy turned his attention to rapidly building new stations to complete the network. As the war opened, Watt worried that its location on the east coast made Bawdsey open to attack, and proposed moving the entire centre to Dundee, Scotland. Fennessy pressed for the now operational sections to be separated from the research arm. This led to the creation of \\"No. 60 Group RAF\\" in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, not far from London. Watt's research arm moved several times in the next few years, before becoming the Telecommunications Research Establishment in Malvern.Ian Brown, \\"A Brief History of The British Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE)\\" , Historical Radar Archive. Retrieved 10 May 2014. At 60 Group, Fennessy led the operational deployment of many radar and radio navigation systems. These included the development of portable radar systems, and both Gee and Oboe navigation systems. One particularly ironic development concerns the Sonne long-range radio navigation system set up by the Luftwaffe. Sonne proved so useful to RAF Coastal Command that when pushing back of the front lines by the Allies meant Germany no longer had access to Spain, Fennessy arranged for spare parts to be delivered to the Sonne broadcasters located there.W. Blanchard, \\"SONNE/CONSOL\\", The Journal of Navigation, Volume 44 Number 3; September 1991. In late 1943 Fennessy prepared a plan for navigation and pathfinding systems to support an amphibious landing on the continent. He selected Normandy as his example location, and when he presented the plan he was detained by Provost Marshals until he convinced them that this was accidental. He was then \\"bigoted\\" into planning for the invasion, and given the task of making the plan come to fruition. He was Mentioned in Despatches and appointed to the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1944, Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1957, and knighted in 1975. ==After the war== Fennessy was demobilised as a Group Captain in the RAF Volunteer Reserve in 1945. For five years he commanded No 3700 (City of London) Radar Reporting Unit. In 1946 he took a position with the Decca Navigator Company, a recent spin-off from Decca Records created to commercialise the Decca Navigator System built by the company during the war. By 1950 Fennessy had completed development of low-cost radar systems, leading to another spin-off, Decca Radar, with Fennessy as the managing director. Decca held a commanding lead in the UK civil maritime radar world for many years, and was a major player worldwide. In 1952 he led efforts that eventually won the contract for the RAF's \\"Type 80 radar\\", and opened a large factory at Cowes on the Isle of Wight to produce them.Eddie Grove and Ron Burr, \\"The Decca Legacy\\", 2010, Chapter 3.2 This factory remained a major radar factory throughout its history. In 1965 Decca Radar was sold to Plessey to become the Plessey Radar Company. Fennessy remained as the managing director of the new company. He moved into telecommunications research when Plessey and GEC formed a joint effort to build satellite ground stations. In 1969 Fennessy became the managing director of British Telecommunications Research, part of the General Post Office. In 1975 he was promoted to become the Post Office's deputy chairman, where he led an effort to get phones into the field. At the time there was a 225,000 person long waiting list for phones, mostly due to the lack of switching capability. He solved this problem by deploying truck-based mobile switches formerly used by the military. That year he presented the 20 millionth telephone in the UK, which was also the 5 millionth in London. ==Last years/death== After retiring in 1977, he took on a number of consultancy jobs; including IMA Microwave Products and British Medical Data Systems, among others. A widower in 1983, he remarried Leonora Patricia Birkett the following year. He was survived by his second wife, his two children from his first marriage, and four grandchildren - one of whom is the Canadian writer Camilla Gibb. ==References== ;Citations ;Bibliography * (Telegraph), \\"Sir Edward Fennessy\\", The Telegraph, 15 December 2009 * David Robertson, \\"Letter: Edward Fennessy obituary\\", The Guardian, 26 January 2010 * Anthony Tucker, \\"Sir Edward Fennessy obituary: Radar pioneer whose skills played a crucial role in the war effort\\", The Guardian, 20 January 2010 Category:1912 births Category:2009 deaths Category:English electrical engineers Category:English people of Irish descent Category:English Roman Catholics Category:Radar pioneers Category:Knights Bachelor Category:People from West Ham Category:People educated at St Bonaventure's Catholic School Category:Place of death missing ","title":"Edward Fennessy"},{"id":"35943095","text":"Me and You () is a 2012 Italian drama film directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, based on the novel with the same name by Niccolò Ammaniti.

However, upon reaching Constantinople, George was afraid of incurring the emperor’s wrath, and so he returned to Rome without having delivered the letters.Mann, pg. 205 Infuriated by George’s actions, Gregory summoned a synod sometime before October 731, with the intent of stripping George of his priesthood. However, the Synod, after confirming the importance of expressing the Roman Church’s opposition to iconoclasm, recommended that George merely be reprimanded. He was to perform a penance for his unwillingness to complete his assigned task, and for the Pope to dispatch him again to Emperor Leo III with the pope’s letters.Hefele, pg. 302 ==Second Synod== When George resumed his commission, he only made it as far as Sicily, where he was arrested by the strategos Sergius on Leo’s orders and held in prison for over a year.Hefele, pgs. 302–303 In response to this, Gregory summoned a new synod which met in Rome, at the shrine of Saint Peter, on November 1, 731. Ninety-three western bishops participated, including Anthony, Patriarch of Grado and John, Archbishop of Ravenna. Also in attendance were all of the Roman lower clergy present in the city at the time, as well as a good number of the Roman nobility.Hefele, pg. 303 The presence of the Archbishop of Ravenna in the synod was a clear indication of just how far Leo's iconoclasm had offended even his supporters in Italy.Duffy, Eamon, Saints & Sinners: A History of the Popes (1997), pg. 63 The synod issued a ruling, outlining the traditional Roman position as articulated by previous popes, in support of Icon veneration, and condemned iconoclasm as a heresy.Treadgold, pg. 354 They also decreed that: > ”if anyone, for the future, shall take away, destroy, or dishonour the > images of Our Lord God and Saviour Jesus Christ, of His Mother, the > immaculate and glorious Virgin Mary, or of the Saints, he shall be excluded > from the body and blood of Our Lord and the unity of the Church.”Mann, pgs. > 205–206 Gregory then entrusted a new letter in favour of icons to the Defensor Constantine who was to take it to the emperor. He was also imprisoned in Sicily, and the letter confiscated. Representatives of various Italian cities who also attempted to send similar letters to Constantinople had the same result. Gregory made a final attempt, this time entrusting two letters to his new Defensor Peter, one for Patriarch Anastasius of Constantinople, and one for the two emperors, Leo and his son Constantine, without success.Mann, pg. 206 In response to the synod’s opposition to iconoclasm, in 733 Leo sent out a fleet under the command of the strategos of the Cibyrrhaeot Theme, but it was shipwrecked in the Adriatic Sea.Treadgold, pgs. 354–355 He then confiscated papal territory in Sicily and Calabria, and raised taxes there. Further, he not only removed Sicily and Calabria from the jurisdiction of the pope, but he also did the same to all the territory within the former Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum, transferring it to the authority of the Patriarch of Constantinople,Hefele, pgs. 303–304 although at that time in practice it only meant Byzantine Greece and the Aegean islands, which were under the emperor’s direct control.Treadgold, pg. 355 The synod also ruled on the ongoing quarrel over the jurisdiction of the Patriarchs of Grado and Aquileia. It ruled that the Patriarch of Grado was to be the primate over the entirety of Venetia and Istria, while the Patriarch of Aquileia would only retain ecclesiastical control over Cormons.Mann, pg. 211 ==References== * Treadgold, Warren, A History of the Byzantine State and Society (1997) * Hefele, Charles Joseph; Clark, William R.

In a career which lasted from September 1985 until November 1988, he ran twenty- four times and won ten races. He recorded his most important success when winning the Classic St. Leger Stakes as a three-year-old in 1986, the same year in which he also won the King George V Stakes, and the Scottish Derby. He continued to race for the next two seasons in major middle-distance and staying races, with his victories including the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud, the Geoffrey Freer Stakes the Cumberland Lodge Stakes and the Yorkshire Cup. He later stood as a stallion in Europe and Japan. ==Background== Moon Madness was a very dark bay horse bred by his owner Lavina, Duchess of Norfolk. He was the most successful runner sired by Vitiges, who was one of the best European colts of his generation, winning the Prix Morny and the Champion Stakes. Moon Madness's dam, Castle Moon, produced seven other winners including the Coronation Cup winner Sheriff's Star. The Duchess sent her colt into training with John Dunlop at Arundel in Sussex. Moon Madness was ridden in most of his races by the veteran Irish jockey Pat Eddery. ==Racing career1985: two- year-old season=== Moon Madness made his only appearance as a two-year-old in a maiden race at Goodwood Racecourse in which he finished fourth, beaten four and half lengths by Faraway Dancer, a colt who went on to finish fourth in the following year's Epsom Derby. Timeform described him as colt who was \\"likely to improve\\". ===1986: three-year-old season=== Moon Madness began his three- year-old season by winning minor handicap races including victories at Newmarket and Haydock. He recorded his first important success when winning the King George V Stakes, a handicap race for three-year-olds at Royal Ascot in \\"impressive\\" style. He was then moved up to Listed class and won the Scottish Derby at Ayr. In August he was sent to York to contest the Great Voltigeur Stakes, an important trial race for the St Leger in which he finished third behind Nisnas and Mashkour. It was his first defeat after five successive wins. In the St Leger at Doncaster Racecourse, Moon Madness started 9/2 third favourite in a field of eight runners with the filly Untold, winner of the Yorkshire Oaks being made favourite. Ridden by Pat Eddery, Moon Madness drew away from his opponents in the straight to win \\"comfortably\\" by four lengths from Celestial Storm and Untold. Later that autumn he finished third to Allez Milord and Baby Turk in the Preis von Europa. ===1987: four-year-old season=== As a four-year-old, Moon Madness began by finishing fourth to Mtoto in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes and then finished third in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot behind Orban. He recorded his most important victory of the season in France, winning the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud from the future Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Tony Bin. He returned to England to contest the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, but finished unplaced behind Reference Point. In August, Moon Madness won the Geoffrey Freer Stakes, beating a field which included Legal Bid and Ibn Bey (runner-up in the Breeders' Cup Classic). In Autumn, Moon Madness was sent to Germany where he finished second to Acatenango in the Grosser Preis von Baden. At Ascot he won his third major prize of the season when he won the Cumberland Lodge Stakes from Knockando and Mashkour, being given \\"perfect handling\\" by Eddery to win from the front. On his final appearance of the year he led the field for much of the way in the Japan Cup before being overtaken in the straight and finishing fifth. ===1988: five-year-old season=== On his 1988 debut, Moon Madness started the 6/5 favourite for the Yorkshire Cup and won \\"smoothly\\" by one and a half lengths from Lake Erie In June, Moon Madness finished third behind Triptych in the Coronation Cup at Epsom and third again behind Almaarad in the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot. He finished last of the ten runners behind Mtoto in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, and was sixth behind Top Class in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes. In his last race, Moon Madness ran for the second time in the Japan Cup, finishing sixth behind Pay The Butler. ==Stud career== Moon Madness stood as a stallion in Europe and Japan, but had very little success as a sire of winners in either location. He was exported from Japan to France on 8 December 1994. ==Pedigree References == Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:1983 racehorse births Category:Thoroughbred family 8-c Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Moon Madness"},{"id":"35943131","text":"McCardie is a surname.

Although hit records eluded her, she proved to be a major name in personal appearances and on radio in the 1940s and 50s. In the 1960s she gained a new audience on the folk music circuit. Her song \\"Ruby, Are You Mad at Your Man?\\" became a bluegrass standard after it was covered by the Osborne Brothers. She started out her career by playing with Frankie Moore's Log Cabin Boys. She influenced the playing of Grandpa Jones. She appeared in two films, Swing in the Saddle and The Second Greatest Sex. ==Early years== Cousin Emmy was born into a family of sharecroppers, with six older siblings and one younger. ==Career== Cousin Emmy began performing as a small child. Playing five-string banjo, she performed with two Carver cousins in a band broadcast on WHB in Kansas City, Missouri. After developing a following in her native Barren County, Kentucky, she eventually attracted the attention of radio station WHAS in Louisville, where she became a featured act with Frankie Moore's Log Cabin Boys in 1935. Between her radio performances, she performed in live shows, often traveling as much as 500 miles in one day. In 1935, she won the National Oldtime Fiddlers' Contest – the first woman to do so. By 1938, she had her own touring group and a radio program. As her radio shows gained popularity, she moved on to larger markets at WNOX in Knoxville, Tennessee, at KMOX in St. Louis (beginning in 1941) and Chicago. Her KMOX broadcast attracted more than 2.5 million listeners \\"from Canada to Mexico.\\" This popularity led to a recording contract at Decca Records. Although she recorded only one album for the label, this recording and her performances with Cousin Emmy and Her Kinfolk helped her develop a devoted fanbase. In 1945, Cousin Emmy ... Song Book was published. It included photographs, a biographical sketch, and lyrics of nine songs. Later, Cousin Emmy relocated to Los Angeles, where she appeared in the film, Swing in the Saddle. She also appeared at local country music clubs while raising several adopted children. After the Osborne Brothers heard Cousin Emmy and Her Kinfolk's recording of \\"Ruby Are You Mad?\\" on a jukebox, they recorded the song for MGM Records in 1956, and it remains one of their best known recordings. The song is perhaps best known today for its top five remake by Buck Owens in 1971. She also had an album, \\"Kentucky Mountain Ballads\\" in 1947 on the Decca label. Cousin Emmy gained a new audience as a result of the folk revival of the 1960s. In 1961, while performing at a \\"Country & Western Night\\" show at Disneyland, she met the New Lost City Ramblers, one of several groups that had formed during that time. She appeared on Rainbow Quest, a folk music series hosted by Pete Seeger. In 1967, the New Lost City Ramblers convinced Cousin Emmy to record with them on the album \\"The New Lost City Ramblers with Cousin Emmy\\". This led to an appearance at the Newport Folk Festival, excerpts of which were released on Vanguard, as part of an anthology collection and in Festival, an Academy Award-nominated documentary. An astute businesswoman, she retained the copyrights to her songs. ==Death== Carver died in Sherman Oaks, California on April 11, 1980, and is buried at the Eternal Valley Memorial Park in Newhall. ==ReferencesExternal links== *All Music Guide *Country Music Television * *Hillbilly- Music Dawt Com Category:1903 births Category:1980 deaths Category:American banjoists Category:Country musicians from Kentucky Category:Decca Records artists Category:Musicians from Appalachia Category:Old-time musicians Category:People from Barren County, Kentucky Category:Vanguard Records artists Category:Singers from Kentucky Category:20th-century American singers Category:Kentucky women singers ","title":"Cousin Emmy"},{"id":"35943148","text":"McCargo is a surname.

During the years 1771-1775, he translated Johann Lorenz von Mosheim's history of the church. In 1778, he wrote an essay in response to the first prize question posed by the Teylers Eerste Genootschap that was founded the same year, and he was awarded a silver medal.

The latest proposal for Hayabusa Mk2 stated its target to be the dormant comet 4015 Wilson–Harrington (1979 VA), with a launch of the probe in 2018. From 2007 to 2010, it was also considered as a joint JAXA-ESA (European Space Agency) mission under the name Marco Polo. The in-situ investigation and sample analysis would allow scientists to improve our knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of a small Near-Earth Object (NEO) which is thought to have kept the original composition of the solar nebula in which planet formed. Thus, it would provide some constraints to the models of planet formation and some information on how life may have been brought to Earth. Information on the physical structure will help defining efficient mitigation strategies against a potential threatening object. ==Scientific objectives== Small bodies, as primitive leftover building blocks of the Solar System formation process, offer clues to the chemical mixture from which the planets formed some 4.6 billion years ago. Current exobiological scenarios for the origin of life invoke an exogenous delivery of organic matter to the early Earth: it has been proposed that carbonaceous chondrite matter (in the form of planetesimals or dust) could have brought these complex organic molecules capable of triggering the pre- biotic synthesis of biochemical compounds on the early Earth. Moreover, collisions of NEOs with Earth pose a finite hazard to life. For all these reasons, the exploration of such objects is particularly interesting and urgent. The principal scientific objective of the Hayabusa Mk2 mission is to return unaltered materials from a NEO. Hayabusa Mk2 will allow us to analyze the samples in terrestrial laboratory, and to obtain measurements that cannot yet be performed from a robotic spacecraft (e.g. dating the major events in the history of a sample: laboratory techniques can determine the time interval between the end of nucleosynthesis and agglomeration, the duration of agglomeration, time of accumulation, crystallization age, the age of major heating and degassing events, the time of metamorphism, the time of aqueous alteration, and the duration of exposure to cosmic radiation). Moreover, the mission will allow scientists to: *Determine the physical and chemical properties of the target body, which are representative of the building blocks of the terrestrial planets. *Identify the major events (e.g. agglomeration, heating, aqueous alteration, solar wind interactions ...) which influenced the history of the target. *Determine the elemental and mineralogical properties of the target body and their variations with geological context on the surface. *Search for pre-solar material yet unknown in meteoritic samples. *Investigate the nature and origin of organic compounds on the target body. *Search for organic compounds which may shed light on the origin of pre-biotic molecules. *Understand the role of minor body impacts in the origin and evolution of life on Earth. NEOs are among the most accessible bodies of the Solar System. ==Naming== The Hayabusa Mk2 was actually proposed before Hayabusa 2. Unlike Hayabusa 2, which reused most of Hayabusa's design, for Hayabusa Mk2 JAXA intended to completely revise the designs and make a larger spacecraft. These are the reasons why this project is called \\"Hayabusa Mk2\\", rather than \\"Hayabusa 3\\". ==Marco Polo== Marco Polo was a proposed Japanese- European space mission aimed at visiting a small primitive asteroid and returning a sample to Earth for analysis in laboratories. It was proposed to the program Cosmic Vision 2015–2025 of ESA in June 2007 and selected for an assessment study in November 2007. This mission was proposed as a joint ESA- JAXA mission. This NEO sample return mission was planned to take advantage of the heritage/expertise of several European (Huygens, Philae) and Japanese (Hayabusa) missions, allowing both parties to increase their technological capabilities and thus meet a challenging objective. A number of possible targets of high scientific interest were selected and covers a wide spectrum of possible launch windows in the time span 2015–2019, namely • the C-type asteroid 1999 JU3, as a representative of the numerous primitive population of the C (carbonaceous) taxonomic type asteroids; another C-type asteroid may be considered, namely 1989 UQ. • asteroids which belong to the primitive D and T types, namely 2001 SG286 and 2001 SK162, respectively; • the dormant comet 4015 Wilson–Harrington (1979 VA), which can provide insights on the unknown link between asteroids and comets; • the primitive C-type double asteroid 1996 FG3, which can provide insight into binary formation processes. A baseline mission scenario to 1999 JU3 would have included a launch with a Soyuz-type launcher of a mother Spacescraft (MSC) possibly carrying a Lander, a sampling device, a re-entry capsule and scientific payloads. The Lander would perform a soft landing, anchor to the asteroid surface, and make various in-situ measurements of surface/subsurface materials near the sampling site. Samples will be collected with either one or complementary techniques. Once the sampling and in-situ measurements will be completed, the MSC will start the return journey towards Earth and will release the capsule for the high-speed re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. The capsule will be retrieved on ground at a low to mid latitude, uninhabited area, possibly in the Northern Hemisphere. After appropriate space quarantine and sterilization processes, samples will be taken out of the capsule in a dedicated sample curation facility to conduct initial sample characterization, prior to their distribution to designated scientists for detail analyses. The Marco Polo proposal was supported by more than 400 confirmed scientists worldwide and was prepared by a joint European Japanese group. This mission was in competition with a few other proposals for the next selection phase at ESA in fall 2009. On February 2010, ESA announced that it has chosen the Euclid, Solar Orbiter, and PLATO missions to enter the definition phase, and Marco Polo was not selected by the SPC for further study.http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=46553 Had it been selected, its study would have continued at least until October 2011, when the SPC selected two missions (Solar Orbiter and Euclid) for implementation. Following Marco Polo's rejection, talks between JAXA and ESA regarding Marco Polo ended, making a joint sample return mission unlikely to happen. JAXA continued research for this spacecraft, and changed its name back to its original Hayabusa Mk2. Meanwhile, scientists who were working for Marco Polo on the European side reused designs intended for Marco Polo to propose a new mission, the MarcoPolo-R, with a possible partnership with NASA.SSS12 第12回宇宙科学シンポジウム [ISAS/JAXA] \\\\- 岩日誌 This proposal was submitted to the Cosmic Vision M3 call. MarcoPolo-R was eventually rejected and the PLATO mission was selected instead. ==Technology demonstrators for Hayabusa Mk2== Some of the technologies planned to be used for the Hayabusa Mk2 mission have never been tested in outer space. In order to reduce the risk in this project, several technology test missions specifically intended for Hayabusa Mk2 have been proposed. ===DESTINY=== DESTINY, short for Demonstration and Experiment of Space Technology for INterplanetary voYage, is a technology demonstration satellite and a candidate for JAXA's second \\"Competitively-Chosen Medium-Sized Focused Mission\\", following SLIM(M-class 1). If selected, DESTINY will be launched in 2020 on an Epsilon rocket. One of its main objectives is to test the μ20 ion engine intended to be used for the Hayabusa Mk2 and Solar-D missions. ===DASH-II=== Since the return capsule of Hayabusa Mk2 will enter Earth's atmosphere at the velocity beyond 14 km/s, a technology demonstrator called DASH-II was proposed within the JAXA Space Exploration Center (JSPEC).はやぶさ2、ASIが正式検討を開始、はやぶさ Mk2 の全貌も明らかに DASH-II is the successor to the unsuccessful DASH (Demonstrator of Atmospheric Reentry System with Hypersonic Velocity) project, launched in 2002, and will be used to demonstrate the thermal protection system (TPS)vital for the Hayabusa Mk2 reentery capsule. The estimated aerodynamic heat load on the capsule is extremely high (at least 20 MW/m2)even by selecting a shallow entry flight path angle. Because the ground heating facilities for TPS development never simultaneously duplicate the flight environment quantities such as the heat flux, the flow enthalpy, the chemical composition, the dynamic pressure, and the radiation so on, a real flight experiment is likely to be necessary. The main objective of the mission is to acquire and demonstrate the reentry/entry technologies associated with future planetary exploration and high-speed reentry missions. DASH-II was supposed to be launched by the same H-IIA rocket with the cancelled ASTRO-G space craft, as a subpayload, on 2013. In 2008, DASH-II was in Pre-Phase-A (working group activities). ==Payloads== The MSC scientific payloads have to include a high resolution imaging system, visible and infrared and mid spectrometers, a LIDAR, and a dust monitor. These instruments will be operated during the approach, hovering and descent phases for science purpose, for landing site selection and for spacecraft safety during near- surface manoeuvres. The Lander would have its own payload for the characterization of the in situ measurements (e.g., close-up camera, panoramic camera, electron microscope, X-ray diffractometer, volatile detector, microbalance, mass spectrometer). Instruments on the Lander would be operated in situ through automatic and/or Earth commanded sequences. These instruments should also allow us to characterize location and surface environment on site of the sampling. The scientific objectives of the mission will be attained by the combination of the following characterisations with the analyses of the returned samples: # morphological surface properties; # environment conditions (e.g. dust, gravity field...); # mass, volume and bulk density; # mineralogical composition; # surface (and possibly subsurface) mineralogy and thermophysical properties (thermal inertia, conductivity, diffusivity, cohesion of the materials....); # surface elemental composition and distribution; # overall internal structure properties; # global topography; # volatile abundance. ==Key capabilities== The Hayabusa Mk2 mission is innovative and would greatly contribute to: *testing new technology developments: re-entry capsule, sampling technique, on board artificial intelligence, telecommunication, in situ energy, planetary protection.tools....; *preparing the next generation of laboratory facilities for extraterrestrial sample analysis; *having a pathfinder for sample returns from high gravity bodies and later on for human missions that may use asteroid resources to facilitate human exploration and the development of space. ==References  External links == * * Gallery featuring images of Hayabusa Mk2 * Website of the DESTINY mission Category:Cancelled spacecraft Category:Japanese space probes Category:Missions to asteroids Category:Missions to comets it:Marco Polo (missione spaziale) ","title":"Hayabusa Mk2"},{"id":"35943234","text":"Mélinée Assadourian Manouchian, before 1945 Mélinée Manouchian (, Mélinée Assadourian, 1913 - 1989)Melinee Manouchian was a French-Armenian resistant, the widow of Missak Manouchian. ==Biography== She was born in 1913 in Constantinople.

They are characterized as having globose heads, open sensory and lateral line canals, and loose skin covered by small spine-like scales. Colour, which has been noted as an important distinguishing characteristic, has generally been described as pink, reddish orange, or rose (Garman, 1899; Caruso, 1989b). However, recent work by Lundsten et al. (2012) suggests that juvenile Chaunacops coloratus may be blue and only adults are red or rose coloured. Chaunacops coloratus was first described in 1899 from a dead specimen collected during the US Albatross Expedition of 1891 at the Cocos Ridge collecting station. It is a deep-sea species of the order Lophiiformes (anglerfishes).This species is benthic, living at reported depths from 1789 to 3297 m in the east Indian and eastern Pacific oceans. It was first filmed alive at the seafloor at Davidson and Taney Seamounts in the northeast Pacific Ocean by scientists from Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), California, US, using a remote-controlled vehicle. As with all members of the Lophiiformes, these fish use lures to attract prey.

He is one of the pioneers who popularised the Fulfilment theology in India that Christ is the crown of Hinduism, though, Fulfilment thesis in Bengal was built on foundation originally laid in Madras by William Miller. He authored several books on Hinduism, notably, The Crown of Hindustan, A Primer of Hinduism, Gita and Gospel, and many alike. ==Biography== Farquhar was born at Aberdeen in 1861. He was educated at Aberdeen Grammar School and Aberdeen University and served an apprenticeship as a draper, but he returned to school at an age of 21, and finished his studies at Oxford University. With no prior ordination, he was recruited by London Missionary Society as a lay educational missionary and sent to India in 1891. He arrived at Calcutta and started his missionary work by teaching at Bhowanipur for eleven years from 1891. He joined Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in 1902 as a national student secretary; later, as a literary secretary, a post which he held until 1923. While working at YMCA, he strived to enable the association to widen its appeal to students through lectures, through personal friendships, and through production of whole new body of literature of the highest grade that India had ever known before. Due to ill-health, he left India in 1923. He spent last six years of his life working as a professor of comparative religion in the University of Manchester. He died in Manchester in 1929. ==Bibliography== During his stint at YMCA, he wrote several books; notably, The Crown of Hinduism in 1913, A Primer of Hinduism in 1914, and Modern Religious Movements in India in 1915, and edited many more. In his famous publication The Crown of Hinduism, he aspired to present Christ, rather than an organizational structure or intellectual system to India. He argued that Karma and Caste, traditional concepts enshrined in Hindu belief, are no longer essential in the construction of modern nation; instead, the message of Christ with high regard to freedom, progress, and civic virtue provides a better intellectual platform upon which to build a progressive India. He accepts that the Caste-system itself is a collective response to the pursuit of a structured and well- balanced society, still, he points at the caste-system for devoid of social justice and egalitarianism. However, he says a society that embraces the heart of Christ's message will inevitably develop social freedom for citizenry. According to Farquhar: His work An Outline of the Religious Literature of India published in 1920, clearly demonstrates his excellent linguistic skills in both Bengali and Sanskrit languages. As an editor for \\"Religious life of India,\\" he inspired missionaries to write to the highest standards of accuracy, sympathy, and Christian-centric; however, he was less fortunate in finding the right Indian Christian co-workers, and never agreed fully to terms with the changed climate of opinion in India after 1919. ===Publications=== * The Apostle Thomas in South India (1927) * The Apostle Thomas in North India.

Kandaswami Chetty, biographer of Dr. William Miller, for Miller \\"Christ was the friend of all that was good and true not only in Christianity, but in Hinduism.\\". The idea of \\"Christ the fulfiller\\" was made familiar to the minds of South Indians of Madras Presidency long before Farquhar's The Crown of Hinduism published in 1913. Even the colleagues of Miller like Bernard Lucas and T.E. Slater, author of The Higher Hinduism in Relation to Christianity published in 1909, long before articulated \\"Fulfilment theology\\" at the World Missionary Conference held at Edinburgh in 1910 itself—Edinburgh conference is considered as the starting point for modern theology of mission and also a launch-pad of the modern ecumenical movement. According to Eric J. Sharpe, professor of Religious studies at University of Sydney; author of books like \\"Not To Destroy, But To Fulfil:the contribution of J.N. Farquhar to Protestant missionary thought in India before 1914\\", \\"John Nicol Farquhar and the missionary study of Hinduism\\", \\"John Nicol Farquhar, a memoir\\", and \\"Faith meets Faith: Some Christian Attitudes to Hinduism in the Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries\\"; and who extensively wrote on Farquhar's theology and missiological approach to Indian religions, has observed that Farquhar, although fully worked out \\"Fulfillment thesis\\" in his seminal work, yet his work on \\"Fulfillment theology\\" in Bengal was built on foundations laid out initially at Madras by William Miller itself. He was the pioneer in popularising his missionary theology Fulfillment theology. Although, he didn't invent it by himself, but based his theology on William Miller Fulfilment theology that took its shape in Madras Presidency. According to this theology, \\"Christ came to fulfill and bring to completion not only the law and the prophets(Matt.5:17) but all the world's higher religions.\\"—in this sense, Christ is the \\"Crown\\" of Hinduism. He popularised and expressed the idea that Christianity was the fulfilment of other religions; he advocated that Christianity was not out to destroy other religions but to fulfill. He intended to develop a workable apologetic to maintain a satisfactory relationship between Christianity and Hinduism—during his days, there was a radical change in Indian Christian thoughts against Western Christianity, sense of nationalism and self-consciousness was growing among Indians, Hindu nationalism started reasserting its opposition to Christianity, Christian missionaries were considering non-Christian religions as evil, and Church union movement towards Christian unity was growing for Indianisation and indigenisation of Church in its administration, liturgy and theology. With \\"Fulfilment theology,\\" he affirmed that Christianity or rather Christ, is the \\"Crown\\" of Hinduism. He hoped, progressive Hindus will embrace the Christianity; Christians, including Christian missionaries would be more sympathetic to other religions. With an intention of developing satisfactory relationship between Hinduism and Christianity, rather than of mere exclusion, he gradually worked out his idea of \\"I came not to destroy but to fulfill.\\"(Mathew 5:17) In his publication The Crown of Hinduism published in 1913, Farquher argued that: Farquhar, though saw some amount of truth in non- Christian religions, yet he denounced some elements that Christianity cannot accept. Caste system is one among them, as he felt that equality, freedom, and justice are distinctive aspects of Christianity. According to Farquher, though, \\"Fulfilment\\" dictated sympathy and reverence as the only \\"way of wisdom\\" for the missionary to the Hindu, it indirectly spelt ultimate extinction for all non-Christian religions. Eric Sharpe has remarked that Farquhar was \\"more than any other individual responsible for bringing about a decisive change in the thinking of Christians over against the phenomena of other faiths.\\" ===Criticism=== A.G. Hogg, professor at Madras Christian College and author of Karma and Redemption in 1904, criticised Farquhar's \\"Fulfilment thesis\\" that says \\"Christianity fulfils all the noblest aspirations of the Hindus,\\" as Hogg perceived that \\"in Hinduism there was searching and finding, and that a Christian was not offering what a Hindu was searching. Under certain circumstances, a Christian however could make the Hindu feel the need for what is available only in Christianity.\\" Farquhar's Fulfillment School has also been discussed, with praise and / or censor, by many writers on philosophy or theology of religion, including Gavin D'Costa, Jacques Dupuis, John Hick, David Marshall, Ivan Satyavrata, James Sharpe, and James Thrower: Satyavrata and Sharpe provide extended analyses. Farquhar is often taken as a leading representative of the Inclusivist School, though this would be more plausible if the focus were on ontology and ethics, which are Farquhar's foci, rather than on salvation. ==References== *FARQUHAR, John Nicol, Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920–2015; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014 ==External links== * * Britain's Experience of Empire in the Twentieth Century – Author:By Andrew Thompso – p.96 * Home Pastor's Pages Academic works Academic works Academic works Academic works The Gospel and Non-Christian Religions: an Irenic Evangelical Assessment Category:1861 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Scottish philologists Category:British Sanskrit scholars Category:Scottish orientalists Category:Scottish Indologists Category:People from Aberdeen Category:People educated at Aberdeen Grammar School Category:Alumni of the University of Aberdeen Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:Scottish Protestant missionaries Category:Scottish people of the British Empire Category:19th-century Scottish people Category:Scottish educational theorists Category:Scottish religious writers Category:Missionary educators Category:Protestant missionaries in India Category:YMCA leaders ","title":"J.

He has a twin sister Živa, who is a prominent painter. Kraus family moved to Croatia from Moravia and Czech Republic during Austro-Hungarian Empire. His paternal grandfather parents, Ignacs and Berta (née Herrnheiser) Krausz lived in Daruvar where his grandfather Josip was born. Kraus grandmother Ruža was born in Bjelovar where she lived with her parents, Samuel and Nanete (née Löwy) Schwarz. His grandfather moved to Zagreb in 1906, where he was the secretary of the Croatian insurance company Merkur. Under his leadership community house Merkur was built in Zagreb. Kraus grandfather was among the initiators of the Merkur sanatorium building which was opened in 1928. In 1918 his grandmother established the Zagreb cinema theater Urania. His grandfather died in Zagreb in 1934. During World War II his father and grandmother escaped the Nazi and Ustaše persecutions through Rijeka from where they went to Italy. In Italy, his father ended up in the concentration camp and after the capitulation of Italy he moved to Switzerland. Kraus grandmother died in Switzerland in 1943 just as she was given a visa for the free countries. After the war Kraus father returned to Zagreb and saved the few remains of the Zagreb Synagogue which was destroyed by the Ustaše in 1941. He dug through the remains of the destroyed synagogue and found the capital column from the synagogue lobby, which is now preserved and kept at the Jewish community of Zagreb. ==Education and career== Kraus studied medicine at the School of Medicine of the University of Zagreb.

It houses various educational establishments for the Afghan Armed Forces. The university sits on a 105 acres of land west of Kabul in the Qargha area. There are three distinct parts to the university: * the National Military Academy of Afghanistan (NMAA), * the Afghan National Army Officer Academy (ANAOA), and * the Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Academy, which will include the Sergeant Major Academy. The site will also house the ANA Foreign Language Institute. ==History of the military site at Qargha== Geography The key to Qargha's historical importance is its geographical position. Qargha lies at the western extremity of Kabul, a low plateau dominated to the north and west by a crescent shaped range of hills. Even to the untrained eye, its strategic significance is obvious. To the south west the pass leading to Wardak, Ghazni and Kandahar forms a deep V shape cut into the mountains; to the west lie the Paghman mountains, the Paghman plateau and the road leading into the Hazarajat; and to the north, beyond the ridge, the Kabul valley extends to Bagram, Charikar and the passes at Parwan and into the Panjshir Valley. Ancient History The valley in which the university is situated has witnessed the passage of Afghanistan's invaders throughout recorded history, from Alexander the Great in 326BC to Genghis Khan in 1222 AD, followed by Tamerlane (Timur) in 1380 and Babur in 1504. On three separate occasions three hundred years later, the shepherds grazing their flocks on the hillsides would have seen the British advancing up the valley from the East, Robert Sale in 1839, George Pollock in 1842 and Frederick Roberts in 1879. Modern History – The Royal Period The modern history of Qargha begins in the early 1880s, when Abdur Rahman Khan, the founder of the regular Afghan army, established a logistics base in Qargha to sustain its operations in the Hazarajat region. The camp was expanded considerably during the reign of Abbul Rahman's grandson, Emir Amānullāh Khān in the 1920s when he invited advisors from the Turkish and German armies to train his army in order to assert his newly won independence from British control. It became the home of the Kabul Division which was essentially the Emir's strategic reserve. The camp performed this function until the time of the Soviet occupation in 1979. Modern History – The Soviet Period The Soviet occupation of Qargha began in 1980. They too used the site as a logistics depot, digging ordnance storage bunkers into the northern hillside of the camp, many of which are still in use by the ANA. By the mid-1980s Qargha was occupied by around 12,000 troops, about half Soviet and half Afghan. Despite the huge number of troops on the site, the Mujahideen succeeded in launching an audacious infiltration attack which destroyed a large part of the ordnance depot with a spectacular explosion which could be heard across Kabul city. The attack caused several months of disruption to Soviet supply lines as they struggled to rebuild the depot. Modern History – The Massoud Period The decision of Abdul Rashid Dostum to move his Jowzjani militia out of Qargha to join Ahmad Shah Massoud’s coalition of warlords in the north and North East of the country contributed to the downfall of Mohammad Najibullah's government. Massoud sited a number of Mujahideen troops at Qargha, and he was a frequent visitor to the site, staying in the commander's white house on the hillside, which is now known as 'Massoud House'. Modern History – The Taliban Period Massoud's forces pulled out of Qargha in 1996. The installations left over from the Royal Army and Soviet periods made it an ideal site for the Taliban, who moved in and used it as a training and ordnance depot. They were still in occupation when American bombs rained down in during the Post 9/11 offensive in October 2001, obliterating most of the buildings. ==Qargha today== Qargha remained a bombed-out moonscape until the decision was made to make it the site of the planned Afghan National Defense University. American contractors moved in mid-2008 to clear the site, which previously served a variety of military roles since the Soviet–Afghan War. When building work is complete, the Qargha site will centralise the training of the majority of future officers and non-commissioned officers in the Afghan Armed Forces. Officer training currently takes place at both the ANDU site and east of the city at the Kabul Military Training Center. NMAA was previously located to the north of the city close to the Kabul International Airport but moved to the ANDU site in 2012. A cornerstone laying ceremony was conducted in April 2010 and the construction was completed in 2013. The total cost for the first phase of work was $200 million. Institutions that are located at ADU include the National Military Academy of Afghanistan. In April 2014, the university was renamed the Defense University of Marshal Fahim in honor of the former Vice President of Afghanistan, Mohammed Fahim who died of a heart attack on 9 March 2014. The ANDU has been commanded by Major General Jalinda Shah since May 2014. ==National Military Academy== The National Military Academy of Afghanistan is modelled on the United States Military Academy and United States Air Force Academy. It is designed to train cadets to produce well-educated and professional officers for each of the disciplines of the ANA and AAF. Schools include Armor, Artillery, Human Resources, Signal, Infantry, Engineer, Legal, Military Police, Logistics, Religious/Cultural Affairs, Intelligence and Finance. NMAA moved to the ANDU site in Qargha on completion of its new campus in 2012. It was previously located in the old Air Academy established by the Soviet Union to the north of Kabul beside Kabul International Airport. NMAA cadets study both military and academic subjects for a total of 4 years and are awarded a degree from ANDU before commissioning into the ANA as Second Lieutenants. Female cadets have studied at the NMAA since 2011 and the first intake of NMAA-trained female officers will graduate in 2015. ==Afghan National Army Officer Academy (ANAOA)== The ANA Officer Academy is also referred to in Afghanistan as ANAOA and the Junior Officer Academy. It was reported as early as 2006 that the United Kingdom would take a primary role in the creation of an Officer Academy for the ANA and AAF. Nicknamed \\"Sandhurst in the Sand\\", the Academy was to be modelled on the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. This was supported by the then-head of the ANA, General Sher Mohammad Karimi, who attended Sandhurst himself in the 1960s. On 29 March 2012 UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond met Afghan General Abdul Rahim Wardak and signed a statement of intent on developing the academy. The UK will provide approximately 75% of the training staff for the new Academy and will be involved in its running long after the 2014 deadline for pulling out the majority of troops. Afghan officer cadets have been undertaking training at Sandhurst in recent years in order to improve the standard of officers in the ANA. On 19 July 2012 on a visit to Kabul the British Prime Minister David Cameron signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the UK to provide mentors and advisors to the Afghan National Army Officer Academy. New Zealand will also contribute support to the ANA Officer Academy. Located in the Qargha area of Kabul, the first concrete steps were taken 10 Oct 12 to start the construction of the academy with a ground breaking ceremony attended by a number of dignitaries including the ANA Chief of General Staff General Shir Mohammad Karimi, Her Majesty's Ambassador to Afghanistan Sir Richard Stagg, ISAF Deputy Commander Lt. Gen. Adrian Bradshaw and Commander of the NATO Training Mission (NTM-A) Lt Gen Bolger. The ANA Officer Academy accepted its first intake of 270 students selected from approximately 10,000 initial applicants in October 2013. Training is being delivered by a staff of Afghan officers and soldiers in cooperation with a team of mentors from the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark and Norway. The ANA Officer Academy started recruiting its first intake of women in February 2014. Female staff will receive instructor training with their male colleagues, and they will be mentored by a coalition female mentoring team. Female candidates will attend a two-day selection test on the Qargha site in April 2014 and a platoon (balook) of 30 female officer cadets will start training alongside the third male intake in June 2014. ==Sergeant Major Academy== The Sergeant Major Academy is currently part of the Kabul Military Training Center. It trains male and female soldiers at the rank of E7 staff sergeant in order to prepare them for service as Sergeant Majors at the ranks of E8 and E9 in the ANA and AAF. The Academy will move to the ANDU site in Qargha on completion of the Phase 2 build project. ==Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) Academy== The Non-Commissioned Officer Academy will undertake training of soldiers from all disciplines up to the level of staff sergeant. ==Defense Institute of Foreign Languages== The Institute will deliver training in Foreign Languages for individuals posted into defence diplomacy billets. ==Women's participation program == In April 2019, at Marshal Fahim National Defense University (MFNDU), the women's participation program (WPP) was awarded 5 buildings at 3 sites.Cheryl A. Moore, Afghanistan District (April 29, 2019) Month of the Military Child takes on a whole new meaning in Afghanistan Three gymnasiums and a child care center were constructed for the program. The sites were appropriately shielded for privacy of the participants.

It is identified as one of the twenty subsidiary unwholesome mental factors within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings. In this context, it is defined as having excessive pride or vanity based on attachment to one's own good fortune, such as possessing youth, good health, or material wealth.Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 923-924.Kunsang (2004), p. 28. ==Definitions== The Abhidharma- samuccaya states: :What is mada? It is joy and rapture associated with attachment (raga) because one sees as excellences the prospect of a long life and other fragile good things by trusting one's youth and good health. Its function is to provide a basis for all basic and proximate emotions. Herbert Guenther explains: :It is an inflated mind which is full of joy and rapture in view of health, abundance of pleasure, etc. It is the root of unconcern (pramāda) by generating all other emotions. Mipham Rinpoche states: :Mada is to have excessive pride or vanity due to any kind of fascination with or attachment towards any kind of conditioned prosperity possessed by oneself, such as good health and youthfulness. It forms a support for the six root unwholesome mental factors and twenty subsidiary unwholesome mental factors. Alexander Berzin explains: :Smugness or conceit (rgyags-pa) is a part of longing desire (raga). From seeing signs of a long life or of any other samsaric glory, based on being healthy, young, wealthy, and so on, smugness is a puffed-up mind that feels happy about and takes pleasure in this.Berzin (2006) == See also == * Mental factors (Buddhism) == References  Sources == * Berzin, Alexander (2006), Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors * Goleman, Daniel (2008).

The station is located from the original Darwin station, and was the southern terminus of the line until 1914. The station precinct is the most complete remaining example of infrastructure associated with the line. == History  Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway === The construction of the railway line from Palmerston (now Darwin) reached Pine Creek in 1889, providing easier access to the goldfields from Port Darwin in the north, however by the time of completion the local mining industry was entering a decline. The station yard was designed with two sidings, each capable of handling forty-two goods wagons to allow for traffic growth at the terminus.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47282982?searchTerm=Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway&searchLimits;= Mixed passenger and goods trains began revenue services on 1 October 1889, operated by the Palmerston division of South Australian Railways and hauled by \\"W\\" class Beyer Peacock locomotives. Three trains per week served Pine Creek, arriving in the evenings on Monday, Wednesday and Friday and departing on the return journey to Palmerston at 8 am the following morning.http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/pinecreek.htm The journey time was approximately nine and a half hours, including a refreshment stop at Adelaide River.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article3373644?searchTerm=Pine Creek Emungalan railway&searchLimits;= The passenger fare between Palmerston and Pine Creek was initially charged at a rate of 4d per mile for first class and 3d per mile for second class, relatively expensive given the passenger accommodations on the trains were criticised as being more suited to livestock than paying passengers. Similarly, tariffs for transport of heavy goods and machinery by rail to Pine Creek were seen by many as being set too high to promote growth of the mining industry even before the line opened, despite this being a major reason for its construction.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article3315612?searchTerm=Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway&searchLimits;= === Commonwealth takeover and extension of line === In 1914, following the Commonwealth taking over administration of the Northern Territory and railway, the line was extended to Emungalan, on the northern bank of the Katherine River to serve the pastoral industry and transport cattle to Vestey's Meatworks in Darwin.http://www.naa.gov.au/naaresources/publications/research_guides/nt- guide/chapter2/2.5.html Pine Creek remained a major station following the extension, and new sidings were added at the station.http://www.comrails.com/routes/route_nar_dar_pineck.html Commonwealth Railways assumed the responsibility for the operation of the station in 1918. The journey time from Pine Creek to Emungalan was approximately three hourshttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article3371655?searchTerm=Pine Creek Emungalan railway&searchLimits;= By the 1920s the train service south was running only once per fortnight, with northbound trains operating weekly. Despite the service reductions and closure of Vestey's Meatworks, the Commonwealth government approved a further extension south to Daly Waters. Simultaneously, a narrow gauge line was extended from Oodnadatta, South Australia to Alice Springs with the eventual aim of joining the north and south lines to form a transcontinental railway. Construction on the northern line was halted at Birdum, short of Daly Waters due to the Great Depression in 1929.http://www.naa.gov.au/naaresources/publications/research_guides/nt- guide/chapter3/index.html In 1926, the line was renamed the North Australia Railway and Pine Creek while no longer a terminus, remained an overnight stopping place. === World War II === With Australia's involvement in World War II, a number of military bases were established in the Northern Territory. The railway proved to be an important transport link. In 1939, Pine Creek station was called on by just a single weekly train in each direction. By 1941, several per week stopped herehttp://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article8211226?searchTerm=Pine+Creek railway station war&searchLimits;=l-decade=194 and this number would continue to grow to 147 weekly services by 1944.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news- article44987036?searchTerm=North+Australia+Railway war&searchLimits;=l-decade=194 The station was a major dispersal base during the war.http://www.heritage.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahpi/record.pl?NT95 == Museum == The station precinct now operates as a museum and is home to a restored and operational 1877 Beyer Peacock NF class steam locomotivehttp://www.australiansteam.com/crframe.htm as well as a former Western Australian Government Railways TA class diesel-electric shunting engine, also maintained in operational condition. Much of the original terminus remains, with preserved buildings including the original passenger station with restrooms, parcel office and waiting room along with the goods shed, loading bank, weighbridge and crane. A number of other original railway buildings were removed following the closure of the line in 1976, however the site was added to the Register of the National Estate in October 1980 and the remaining infrastructure has been preserved and progressively restored since this time.

Lakhdar's wife is very angry with Rachid, and yells at him for making them pay for closure on the trauma that she accuses him of having caused them. He once again denies involvement, saying that he only heard the story of what had happened and not participated, adding that those responsible had died a month later.

It is named after a Slovak Secret Service wiretap file () from the years 2005-2006 which leaked to the internet in December 2011. The file suggests information about politicians, officials and business executives discussing kickbacks in return for procurement and privatization contracts. However the accuracy of the content has not been officially confirmed yet and due to lack of the original tapes it is rather speculation than evidence of true conversations. The file presents alleged massive corruption at the highest level and its leak to the public rocked the Slovak political scene. On October 16, 2019, several Slovak mainstream medias received a link to download a file that appear to be a copy of original wiretapping operation Gorilla. The Gorilla scandal resulted in a wave of nationwide political protests across the country, that organized themselves into a coordinated effort called Protest Gorila. The scandal also influenced the results of the 2012 Slovak parliamentary election. Although the full contents of the file have not yet been confirmed, Interior Minister Daniel Lipšic has confirmed the intelligence agency did carry out a wiretapping operation named Gorilla. On 12 January 2012 the Regional Court in Bratislava confirmed it allowed the Gorilla wiretaps. However, the accuracy of the content has not been officially confirmed. == Background == In 2005, the head of the analytical department of the Slovak Intelligence Service (SIS) Peter Mravec noticed, that government limousines and cars of the Penta Group, one of the two biggest investment companies in the country, often park in the vicinity of his house on Vazovova Street in Bratislava, where he lived with his wife and two children at that time. In November 2005, the SIS filed a demand to wiretap the flat next to Mravec's. This flat belonged to businessman and former ex-police officer Zoltán Varga. Due to Varga's size and appearance, the wiretap was code named gorilla (). == Description == One of the posters used by the citizens in organizing the protests in the aftermath of the Gorilla scandal The leaked text contains operational transcripts in the form of a report made by analyst Peter Mravec from two wiretaps: Gorila and Gorila1. Both wiretaps record conversations held from 2005 to 2006 in some parts of one flat located at Vazovova Street No. 9/A in Bratislava, Slovakia. Recorded are conversations of the flat's owner Zoltán Varga with the Head of the Special Affairs Department of the Office for Combating Corruption of the Presidium of the Police Force of Slovakia () Ján Rejda and businessman Peter Demovič and conversations of the flat's co-user Jaroslav Haščák, partner of the Penta Group with Deputy Prime Minister of Slovakia Jirko Malchárek, member of the Executive Board of the National Property Fund () and Director of the Section of the National Property Fund for Establishing companies and Executing shareholder rights () Anna Bubeníková (SDKÚ), leader of the Direction – Social Democracy political party Robert Fico and his personal assistant František Határ. The text is written in the third person in a descriptive manner, using direct quotations from the wiretaps only occasionally. It also contains some explanatory notes worked into the text by Mravec, filling in some of the missing context. == Aftermath == The Gorilla file was leaked to the internet by an unknown source on 21 December 2011, according to TA3 TV, it was leaked a few hours before noon. The same day, spokesperson of the Penta Group Martin Danko declared the Gorila file to be \\"fiction\\" and \\"all made up\\". The first popular political protest took place at the SNP Square in Bratislava on 27 January 2012. Several thousand people marched in front of the Presidential Palace, throwing bananas. In 2018, following murder of Ján Kuciak, police officers who raided villa of prominent oligarch, and prime suspect in the murder, Marián Kočner found in his security safe USB keys with copies of audio records from Gorilla file that were thought to be lost. After the confirmation of audio copies, general prosecutor Jaromír Čižnár admitted that he heard bits from the audio recording when former general prosecutor Dobroslav Trnka played it to him and former Prime Minister Robert Fico. Dobroslav Trnka is well known friend of Kočner, and according to leaks from police Kočner used to instruct him on what to do when he was General prosecutor. Čižnár claimed that at the time he was unaware that audio he heard was copy from Gorilla file and asked Trnka to not involve him in the affair. == See also == * Slovak politics * Slovak political scandals * Penta (investment group) * Crime in Slovakia == References  External links == * A version of the Gorilla file (in Slovak) * A version of the Gorilla file (in Slovak) Category:Politics of Slovakia Category:Economy of Slovakia ","title":"Gorilla scandal"},{"id":"35943358","text":"Mohammad Jihad al-Laham (, born 13 January 1954) is a Syrian politician who has been the Speaker of the People's Council of Syria from 2012 to 2016.

There is no information about his youth and early musical education in Gyulafehérvár. After the outbreak of the Greek Revolution in 1821, Mangel joined the movement of Philhellenism, and in 1823 he went to Greece to fight alongside the Greeks. In 1824, Mangel and his father arrived in Missolonghi, where they entered the regular brigade which was under formation under the auspices of Lord Byron. After Byron's death, he followed the French philhellene, Colonel Charles Nicolas Fabvier, who was tasked with creating a regular army. From then on, Mangel's activity is known by the Greek fighter and writer Christos Vyzantios. According to Vyzantios, Mangel was a German from the Kingdom of Württemberg, who had served before as a lieutenant in the French Army. As part of the first regular regiment, Fabvier organized a military band, called the Musical Troupe (Μουσικός Θίασος), and entrusted its direction to Mangel. Under the command of Fabvier, Mangel and his band took part in the Athens campaign of 1825, and in expeditions the islands of Euboea and Chios. In 1828, with the arrival of the first Governor of Greece, John Kapodistrias, Mangel and his orchestra settled in Nafplion, the then capital of Greece. After the liberation of Greece and with the establishment of a monarchy under the Bavarian prince Otto, the orchestra initially remained in Nafplion, but then, on the arrival of Bavarian military bands, was transferred to nearby Argos. In 1834 Mangel converted to Greek Orthodoxy, choosing the name \\"Michael\\", married a local woman, and left the army. Following the establishment in 1843 of a Music School in Athens, Mangel was recalled to active service and appointed the School's director. At the same time Mangel wrote military marches on the basis of Greek folk music and adapted European marches for local use. Later, Mangel was promoted to musical inspector and retired in 1870 with the rank of Major. ==Works == Manuscripts of three triumphal marches dedicated to King Otto, are stored in the Bavarian State Library in the city of Munich. ==References Sources == * Konstantin Soter Kotsowilis: Die Griechenbegeisterung der Bayern unter König Otto I.

He served with British forces at Kandahar and Karachi under Lord Roberts, where he attained the rank of sergeant. He moved to Australia in about 1890, arriving by sailing ship at the port of Fremantle.Hankel, Valmai A., 'Bejah, Dervish (1862–1957)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bejah-dervish-5187/text8721, accessed 26 May 2012. This article was first published in hardcopy in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 7, (MUP), 1979. At that time, communities of so-called Afghan (in fact hailing from a number of countries and ethnicities) cameleers were already established in Australia and involved in exploration and transport, having helped to construct the Overland Telegraph Line and open up the Western Australian Goldfields, amongst other accomplishments. In 1896 Bejah was engaged by Lawrence Wells to manage the camels used for transport on the ill-fated Calvert Scientific Exploring Expedition to the Great Sandy Desert of north-central Western Australia. In 1902 he settled in Marree, South Australia, where he bought land and from where he operated his camel transport business. On 15 December 1909 he married a widow, Amelia Jane Shaw, with whom he had a son, Abdul Jubbar (Jack). In 1930 he retired from camel driving to grow date palms. In 1954 Bejah was featured in the award-winning documentary film The Back of Beyond, directed by John Heyer. On 6 May 1957 he died in hospital at Port Augusta and was buried in the local cemetery. Bejah is commemorated by a plaque on the Jubilee 150 Walkway in Adelaide as someone who made a major contribution to the development of South Australia. He is lauded in the poem \\"Afghan\\" by Douglas Stewart. ==See also== *Afghan (Australia) ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Photographs of Dervish in the State Library of South Australia * *Bibliography in ADB citation above Category:1862 births Category:1957 deaths Category:Camel drivers Category:Australian people of Baloch descent Category:Australian explorers Category:People of British India ","title":"Dervish Bejah"},{"id":"35943585","text":"Elisabeth (French: Élisabeth), also known as Isabelle Mabille (1143 – Arras, 28 March 1183), was ruling Countess of Vermandois from 1168 to 1183, and also Countess of Flanders by marriage to Philip I, Count of Flanders. She was the eldest daughter of Ralph I, Count of Vermandois and his second spouse, Petronilla of Aquitaine. ==Life== Elisabeth was the second child and oldest daughter of her father; she had an elder brother named Hugh from his first marriage to Eleanor of Champagne. Therefore Elisabeth was second in line to inherit the county. When Elisabeth was aged two, she was joined by a brother also named Ralph; this pushed Elisabeth back to third in line. Around three years later, Elisabeth gained a further sister, Eleonore. Elisabeth's mother Petronilla was the sister of the much-celebrated Eleanor of Aquitaine, Queen consort of both France and England in her lifetime, this made Elisabeth first cousin to both Richard I of England and John of England. Ralph had divorced his first wife Eleonore, however his marriage to Petronilla had been viewed as illegitimate by Pope Innocent II, the marriage was later legitimized by Pope Celestine II thus allowing Isabelle Mabile to possibly inherit. However, Ralph divorced Petronilla in 1151 then remarried the following year to Laurette, daughter of Thierry, Count of Flanders. ===Marriage=== Map of France from 1180, Vermandois is in the North East On 14 October 1152, Elisabeth's father died and Hugh was made Count of Vermandois; therefore, Elisabeth returned to second-in-line. In 1159, sixteen-year-old Elisabeth married Philip I, Count of Flanders.Annales Blandinienses 1157, MGH SS V, p. 29.John W. Baldwin, The Government of Philip Augustus: Foundations of French Royal Power in the Middle Ages, (University of California Press, 1986), 15. The following year, Elisabeth's brother Ralph married Philip's sister Margaret. In the same year, Hugh abdicated from his position as count to become a monk; therefore, Ralph succeeded as count, Elisabeth was then promoted to first in line, her sister Eleonore in second. ===Rule=== In 1167, Elisabeth's brother Ralph died of leprosy. As his marriage to Margaret had proved childless, Elisabeth inherited the County of Vermandois,Flandria Generosa (Continuatio Bruxellensis), MGH SS IX, p. 325. which she ruled over jointly with her husband; this pushed Flemish authority further south, to its greatest extent thus far, and threatened to completely alter the balance of power in northern France. Philip and Elisabeth were childless. In 1175, Philip discovered that Elisabeth was committing adulteryGislebertus (of Mons), Chronicle of Hainaut, transl. Laura Napran, (The Boydell Press, 2005), 34 note138.Ex Radulfi de Diceto imaginibus historiarum, RHGF XIII, p. 198. and had her lover, Walter de Fontaines, beaten to death. Philip then obtained complete control of her lands in Vermandois from King Louis VII of France. In 1177, when Philip left for the Holy Land, he designated his sister Margaret and her second husband, Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut, as his heirs. Elisabeth died at Arras on 28 March 1183 aged thirty- nine or forty, prompting King Philip II of France to seize Vermandois on behalf of her sister, Eleonore, who succeeded her. Elisabeth was buried at Amiens Cathedral. ==References== Category:1143 births Category:1183 deaths Category:Capetian House of Vermandois Category:12th-century women rulers Category:12th-century French women Category:Countesses of Flanders Category:12th-century French people ","title":"Elisabeth, Countess of Vermandois"},{"id":"35943586","text":"Sony Xperia Ion is an Android smartphone developed and manufactured by Sony Mobile Communications.

He went to Rome for six months, and on return spent the majority of his working life in Edinburgh, having his studio at 19 Scotland Street. Lees also taught drawing. In the 1830s Charles Lees, portrait painter is listed as living at 9 Elder Street in Edinburgh's New Town. He died in Edinburgh on 20 February 1880 and was buried with his wife Elizabeth Christie of Baberton, and their children, in Warriston Cemetery. The grave stands on the north side of the main east-west path in the upper section. ==Portrait painting to sporting and recreational subjects== Charles Lees achieved initial renown as a portrait painter, his accomplishments leading to his election to the Royal Scottish Academy in 1830. He later served as the Academy's Treasurer. Lees is perhaps best known for his work specialising in sporting and recreational subjects, particularly golfing and curling, to which he turned from the 1840s. ==\\"The Golfers\\"== In 1847 Lees completed his depiction of the 1844 grand match at St Andrews in an oil painting, The Golfers, which has been cited as being \\"the most famous golfing work of art in the world.\\" It shows the annual autumn meeting of October 1844, the scene being set at the 'Ginger Beer Hole' on the Old Course at St Andrews. The match that Lees painted was between Sir David Baird and Sir Ralph Anstruther of Balcaskie against Major Hugh Lyon Playfair of St Andrews and John Campbell, Esq. of Glensaddel. As a portrait painter Lees had painted the true likeness of the actual players and spectators, and a key survives naming them. The original oil painting is owned by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. An engraving was made by Charles E. Wagstaffe (born 1808) from which prints were produced. In 2006 the National Galleries of Scotland produced a monograph on the painting: 'The Golfers', by P. Lewis and A. Howe. ==References== Category:1800 births Category:1880 deaths Category:19th-century Scottish painters Category:Scottish male painters Category:Artists from Edinburgh Category:People from Cupar Category:Royal Scottish Academicians Category:Scottish portrait painters Category:Sports artists Category:Scottish expatriates in Italy Category:19th-century male artists ","title":"Charles Lees (painter)"},{"id":"35943619","text":"July 7, 1912: The Automat opens, introduces \\"fast food\\" July 30, 1912: The Emperor Meiji dies after 44 years of transforming Japan into a major world power.

It is identified as one of the twenty subsidiary unwholesome mental factors within the Mahayana Abhidharma teachings. In this context, it is defined as the category of anger (pratigha) or aversion (dvesha), and functions to treat others abusively and without compassion.Guenther (1975), Kindle Locations 926-927.Kunsang (2004), p. 28. ==Definitions== The Abhidharma-samuccaya states: :What is vihiṃsā? It belongs to the emotion anger (pratigha), lacks loving kindness, pity, and affection, and has the function of treating others abusively. Herbert Guenther explains: :It is the desire to treat others abusively (40b) without having kind feelings towards living beings. Mipham Rinpoche states: :Vihiṃsā belongs to the category of anger (pratigha). Its function is to be uncompassionate an to cause harm Alexander Berzin explains: :Cruelty (rnam-par ‘tshe-ba) is a part of hostility (dvesha) and has three forms. :* Hooliganism (snying-rje-ba med-pa) is a cruel lack of compassion with which we wish to cause mischief or harm to others. :* Self-destructiveness (snying-brtse-ba med-pa) is a cruel lack of self-love with which we wish to cause mischief or harm to ourselves. :* Taking perverse pleasure (brtse-ba med-pa) is cruelly rejoicing when seeing or hearing of others’ suffering.Berzin (2006) == See also == * Mental factors (Buddhism) == References  Sources == * Berzin, Alexander (2006), Primary Minds and the 51 Mental Factors * Goleman, Daniel (2008).

The team also acquired John Starks, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings from the New York Knicks during the offseason. Starks previously played for the Warriors during the 1988–89 season. After losing their first five games, the Warriors started to show signs of improvement in a lockout shortened season. Despite playing 32 games fewer, they won two more games than the previous year, finishing sixth in the Pacific Division with a 21–29 record. Jamison was selected to the All- Rookie Second Team. Following the season, Bimbo Coles was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, Muggsy Bogues signed as a free agent with the Toronto Raptors, and Tony Delk signed with the Sacramento Kings. ==OffseasonDraft picks=== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  5  Vince Carter  SG/SF   North Carolina } ==RosterRegular seasonSeason standings=== :z - clinched division title :y - clinched division title :x - clinched playoff spot ===Record vs. opponents=== {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=301998-99 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !008080;color:#800080;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000000;color:#5787DC;width=35\\"CLE !00008B;color:#008000;width=35\\"DAL !141A44;color:#BC2224;width=35\\"DEN !0C7674;color:#BB222C;width=35\\"DET !072E63;color:#DC5A34;width=35\\"GSW !002366;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !00471B;color:#5C378A;width=35\\"MIL !044D80;color:#000000;width=35\\"MIN !12305B;color:#C4CED4;width=35\\"NJN !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !000000;color:#BB9754;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !6846A8;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#992634;width=35\\"SEA !7436BF;color:#BE0F34;width=35\\"TOR !644A9C;color:#149BC7;width=35\\"UTA !0CB2AC;color:#000000;width=35\\"VAN !044D7D;color:#BC7A44;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  3–0  3–0  3–1  2–1  0–1  0–0  1–2  0–0  1–0  3–1  1–0  0–0  0–3  1–2  0–0  1–2  2–1  2–2  2–1  1–0  0–0  0–0  0–0  0–0  2–1  0–0  1–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  0–3  —  1–2  2–1  2–2  0–0  1–0  0–3  0–0  0–0  0–3  1–0  0–0  3–0  0–3  0–1  1–2  1–2  1–2  1–2  0–0  0–1  0–1  0–0  0–0  1–2  0–0  1–0  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Charlotte  0–3  2–1  —  2–1  2–1  0–0  0–0  3–0  0–1  0–0  1–2  0–0  0–1  1–2  2–2  0–0  3–0  1–3  1–2  1–2  1–0  1–0  0–0  0–0  0–0  2–1  1–0  0–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Chicago  1–3  1–2  1–2  —  0–3  0–1  0–0  0–3  0–0  0–0  0–3  1–0  0–0  1–2  1–3  0–0  2–1  1–2  0–3  1–2  0–0  0–0  0–0  0–1  0–1  1–2  0–1  1–0  1–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cleveland  1–2  2–2  1–2  3–0  —  0–0  0–0  1–2  1–0  0–1  0–3  0–0  1–0  0–3  1–2  0–0  3–0  1–2  1–2  1–2  1–0  0–0  0–0  1–0  0–0  2–2  0–1  0–0  1–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Dallas  1–0  0–0  0–0  1–0  0–0  —  2–1  0–1  2–2  2–2  0–0  3–0  0–3  0–1  0–0  1–2  0–1  0–0  1–0  0–0  1–3  0–3  2–2  1–3  0–3  0–0  0–3  2–1  0–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Denver  0–0  0–1  0–0  0–0  0–0  1–2  —  0–0  1–3  0–4  0–1  3–0  1–2  0–1  1–0  0–3  1–0  0–0  0–0  0–0  0–3  0–3  0–3  0–4  2–2  0–0  1–2  3–1  0–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Detroit  2–1  3–0  0–3  3–0  2–1  1–0  0–0  —  0–0  0–0  2–1  0–0  0–0  2–1  2–1  0–1  2–1  2–1  0–4  1–3  1–0  0–0  0–0  0–1  1–0  2–1  1–0  0–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Golden State  0–0  0–0  1–0  0–0  0–1  2–2  3–1  0–0  —  0–3  1–0  2–1  1–2  0–0  0–1  2–2  0–0  0–0  0–1  0–0  1–2  2–2  1–2  0–3  1–2  0–0  0–4  4–0  0–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Houston  0–1  0–0  0–0  0–0  1–0  2–2  4–0  0–0  3–0  —  0–0  3–1  1–2  0–1  0–0  2–1  1–0  0–0  0–1  0–0  2–2  2–1  3–0  0–3  2–1  1–0  0–3  4–0  0–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Indiana  1–2  3–0  2–1  3–0  3–0  0–0  1–0  1–2  0–1  0–0  —  0–0  1–0  2–2  3–0  0–0  3–1  2–1  1–2  1–2  0–0  0–1  0–0  0–0  0–0  2–1  0–0  1–0  3–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  L.A.

In her senior career she competed in two Olympic Games, two World Championships and one European championship. At the 1997 Athletics World Championships she became the first Irish athlete to ever reach a sprint final at a major event. Because of her blonde hair and good looks, Smith had been described as the 'Anna Kournikova' of the track. ==Juvenile years== Susan's first-ever race. Winning the St Paul's Parish finals of the Community Games in 1978. She was 6 years old.She started her career by competing in the Community Games, a competition based on parish communities all over the country. She began running at age 6 and qualified for the Community Games' national finals every year. In 1981 she won her first-ever National medal – in the Community Games national final of the 200m. She had also joined her local athletic club, St Paul's A.C., which competed in competitions organised by the National Federation for young athletes, Bórd Lúth-Cleas Óganach na hÉireann (BLOE,) having her first success with her colleagues on the club's u/11 4 × 100 m relay team. It was to be the first of many. Her first individual BLOE title came in 1984, at age 13, and she remained unbeaten by any Irish female in hurdles competitions at every level of competition (juvenile, schools, junior and senior) for the rest of her athletic career until she retired in 2000. In schools competition she represented Ireland for three years in succession, captaining the team in 1988. In that same year she captained three Irish teams – in the Four Nations schools international championship, the Celtic Games and the European Catholic Schools Games (FISEC), winning medals in all three. Susan gained her first senior international vest in 1988 (whilst still only sixteen years old) when she was selected to represent Ireland in the 100m hurdles at Grangemouth, Scotland in a match against Scotland and Iceland where she finished fourth in 14.44secs. She competed in the British Amateur Athletic (AAA) under-age championships winning four medals; one gold, two silver and one bronze. She was the outstanding under-age athlete of her generation and in 1988 she was selected as the Irish juvenile athlete of the year. When she reached eighteen years of age she was no longer eligible for juvenile competition so she progressed to the oldest senior club in the city, Waterford A.C., for whom she competed until her retirement. To mark the 30th year of BLOE the Federation held a banquet in February 2000 at which the best athletes from all the 32 counties of Ireland were honoured. To climax the celebrations the Federation named Susan as their Star of Stars – the greatest juvenile athlete in Ireland in the Federation's 30-year history. She was presented with the award by Ireland's Taoiseach. ==Junior career== Susan won the 100m hurdles national title each year during her eligibility as a Junior and represented Ireland in the European and World Junior championships. Before the European tests held in Varaždin, Yugoslavia Susan had won the Irish indoor 60m hurdles in an Irish record time and in Varaždin she reached the semi-final of the 100m hurdles where she finished in 5th place, missing the final by one place (see external links below). The World Junior Championships of 1990 were held in Plovdiv, Bulgaria when Susan was in her first year in college. Several months before the Games opened she competed in the Penn Relays and broke the Irish Junior record for the 400m hurdles with 60.26 secs, in only her second run over the distance. At Plovdiv she competed in both hurdles disciplines. She finished in 5th place in the 100mH semi-final missing out on a final appearance, once again, by centimetres. In the semi-final of the 400m hurdles she led the field to the 2nd last hurdle but lost her stride pattern and was overtaken. ==College career== Susan Smith and Yuri Anisimov at a training session in Limerick, 1988When Susan was still a junior she met with top USSR coach, Yuri Anisimov who had coached his wife, Tatiana, to an Olympic 100mH silver medal in 1976 and who was in Ireland delivering coaching sessions in various locations. He expressed great interest in her and asked her to travel to all those sessions where he could give her in-depth coaching. When he had to return to Russia he asked Susan to consider moving to Leningrad to train under his guidance. He believed that by doing so she would win a European Junior championship gold medal. This placed her in a terrible dilemma because her Leaving Certificate results had gained her a place as a law student in University College Dublin, and she was being recruited by Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, USA, (one of the top Ivy League Universities). She opted for a University career in the USA. Her career at Brown went well, although she was disqualified in her first race for a false-start and also lost her first championship race. Her four years there were encapsulated in an article by the associate editor of Brown Alumni Monthly, James Reinbold who wrote \\"In four years at Brown, Smith won fifteen individual titles – more than any athlete, female or male, in the history of the Heps [Ivy League Colleges plus Army and Navy]. She was named Hep MVP three times and was Brown's female athlete of the year as both a junior and senior. She holds three University records: 55-metre hurdles (indoors), 100-metre hurdles (outdoors), and 400-metre hurdles (outdoors) and she has run on two relay teams that have set school records: the 4x400 (indoors) and the 4x100 (outdoors).\\" In her final year the track team elected her as captain. Susan graduated in 1993 with two Business degrees. In her last race for the University she finished third in the 400mH at the Eastern Collegiate championship where she recorded 58.31secs, which was then one of the fastest times ever by an Irishwoman and the then sixth fastest time ever achieved on the USA college circuit. Smith had been remarkably free from injury in her four years at Brown despite competing in a number of events – 100m dash/200m dash/100mH/400mH/4 × 100 m relay/4 × 400 m relay and the Pentathlon – but in her very first race after graduation she broke her foot while competing in the 400mH for Ireland at the Westathletic Games in Sittard, the Netherlands. The injury was to disrupt her senior career and it would be a full three years before she again set foot on a running track to run a competitive race. Susan returned to the US to have an operation on her foot and then to take up a job with Coopers & Lybrand in Boston as a financial analyst/auditor. ==Senior career== Susan Smith (Ireland) Olympic Games 1996, Atlanta Although the foot-operation enabled Smith to walk properly, her athletic career appeared to be over because she could not run round a bend without experiencing excruciating pain. The injury persisted for the rest of the 1993 season and for all of 1994 and 1995. Despite consulting numerous doctors a remedy was not found. With the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta approaching she decided to move to Atlanta and, because she needed to prove to the Irish selectors that she could still run championships, she returned home to Ireland and won the National 100m hurdle title (without any training for three years). When she returned to the USA she began a tour of every sports doctor in the region. Finally, an Atlanta-based orthopaedic surgeon decided to re-examine the foot. She received a local anaesthetic and in an operation that lasted all of seven minutes the problem became evident. The operation revealed that a screw that was used to join the broken bone in 1993 had lodged in a tendon, causing the terrible pain. She was then able to start training again. Smith then began a rush to try and qualify for the Olympic Games in the following year, only 11 months hence. With a new and tougher training regime under coach Loren Seagrave she felt that she could qualify for the upcoming Olympic Games – but needed the opportunity to prove it. With the help of her firm, Coopers & Lybrand she went to South Africa for early season competition and thus began the greatest single-year assault on an Irish athletics record ever seen. In the four months between March 1996 and the Olympic Games in July 1996 she set six new Irish records for the 400m hurdles as follows: 56.49secs, Cape Town, 22 Mar '96; 56.14ssecs, Santry, 9 June '96; 56.01secs, Santry, 16 June '96; 55.46secs, Padua ITA, 7 July '96; 55.08secs, Raleigh Durham NC, USA, 14 July '96 and 54.93secs, Atlanta Olympic Games, 29 July '96 In the Olympic Games Smith finished third in the first round and thereby qualified for the semi-final where she finished in 5th position, missing the Olympic final by only one place – but had run another Irish record (See external links, below). Her performances over the year convinced her to become a full-time athlete to enable her to further her career. This was not possible without sponsorship but after discussions with her employers, Coopers & Lybrand, they transferred her to their Dublin office and allowed her to work part-time. The 1997 World Championships were next in her sights and she journeyed to South Africa in January 1997 for warm-weather training. During one of her training sessions she tore a hamstring (an injury that was to come back to haunt her in subsequent years) and two days later she contracted a virus that seriously affected her health. After ten days she returned home and in all lost 14 weeks training. Despite these setbacks the year 1997 was another successful chapter in her career. She competed with great distinction in the Grand Prix season, competing in the Grand Prix finals of both the 400m Hurdles and 100m Hurdles, finishing 5th in the latter in a time of 13.22secs. This was a full half-second faster than the Irish record, but the wind at 2.1 m/s was just over the legal limit. However, she ran superbly in the 1997 World Championships in Athens, finishing 2nd in her heat of the 400m Hurdles in a new Irish record of 54.61secs and then ran fourth in the semi-final to qualify for the final – the first Irish sprinter to achieve this feat. She finished 7th in the final. After her exertions in 1997 she was rewarded by being ranked no.2 in the European 400mH lists. Her performances during that year also earned her 9th place in the 1998 IAAF World ranking lists, and the American magazine Track and Field News ranked her 10th in the world on her overall season. She returned to Waterford in August 1997 to get married and then decided to try the life of a full-time athlete. She resigned her position with Coopers and Lybrand and with sponsorship from the Irish Sports Council, the shoe company ASICS and TNT Express Worldwide, she returned to the USA. In 1998 she started her preparations for the European Athletic Championships scheduled for Budapest. In March she travelled to Tallahassee, Florida for a month of warm weather training. Here she had to abort her training with four stress fractures in her shins resulting in a loss of 11 weeks training. Despite this setback her season went well and she set three new Irish records in the 100m hurdles; 13.58secs in the European Cup as Ireland achieved promotion; 13.31secs in the National Championships and 13.12secs in the National League final. She had captained the Irish team for the European Cup in Lithuania where she also won the 400m hurdles. In the week before the European Championships she set another 400m Hurdles Irish record of 54.31secs and she appeared set for a medal in the championships. She won her semi-final of the 400mH, the first Irish sprinter to ever win a semi-final of a major championship, despite being sick before and after the race. Sickness struck again for the final of the event where she was a disappointing eighth. In 1999, after a full season of International and Grand Prix competition, she competed in the Seville World Championships where she reached the semi-final stage. Later that year Susan was inducted into the Brown University Hall of Fame. In a biography of Susan the Brown University website summed up her career in Brown thus: \\"Susan is widely regarded as the greatest women's track and field runner in Brown history and one of the finest women's athletes in the history of Brown athletics.\\" At the Irish National Championships in 2000 Susan announced that she would be retiring from the sport after the Sydney Olympics. Just four days before her first round race in the Sydney Games she pulled a hamstring during some light training in the Olympic village. She was examined by the Irish medical team who advised her to withdraw from the Games but she insisted that further examinations be sought from the world famous sports therapist Ger Hartmann. He concurred with the decision but the Irish doctors then asked the advice of their British and Australian colleagues. All agreed that she should not run but Smith insisted that she be allowed compete – it was, after all going to be her last race. She received two pain-killing injections, one on the day before her race and another some hours before her race. In addition to Smith's ham-string problem she also suffered a flu-like bug that struck-down both her and another member of the Irish team. Smith finished fourth in her heat, just missing out on a semi-final place. The leg had broken down during the race and she could not take her place on the Irish 4 × 400 m relay team that subsequently set a new Irish record. ==Personal life== Susan currently lives in the US with her husband Ryan and their four children. ==Record== Her career record is as follows: NATIONAL SENIOR CHAMPIONSHIP TITLES (13) 100mH (8): 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2000 400mH (5): 1992, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2000 NATIONAL SENIOR RECORD 400mH, 54.31secs, Zurich, SWI, 12 August 1998 ==References== Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Irish female hurdlers Category:Olympic athletes of Ireland Category:World Athletics Championships athletes for Ireland Category:Sportspeople from County Waterford ","title":"Susan Smith-Walsh"},{"id":"35943699","text":"The 1999–2000 NBA season was the Warriors' 54th season in the National Basketball Association, and 38th in the San Francisco Bay Area.1999-2000 Golden State Warriors The city of Oakland hosted the 2000 NBA All-Star Game. During the offseason, the Warriors acquired Mookie Blaylock from the Atlanta Hawks. The Warriors struggled losing 16 of their first 18 games as head coach P. J. Carlesimo was fired after a 6–21 start, and was replaced with General Manager Garry St. Jean, where the team then suffered a 12-game losing streak. Second-year star Antawn Jamison, who led the Warriors with 19.6 points per game was invited to the Slam Dunk Contest, but did not participate due to a knee injury after 43 games. At midseason, the Warriors traded John Starks to the Chicago Bulls, and acquired second-year guard Larry Hughes, and former Warriors forward Billy Owens from the Philadelphia 76ers in a three-team trade. The Warriors finished sixth in the Pacific Division with a terrible 19–63 record. Following the season, Donyell Marshall was traded to the Utah Jazz in a four-team trade, Owens was dealt along with Jason Caffey to the Milwaukee Bucks, Terry Cummings retired and St. Jean was fired as coach. ==OffseasonDraft picks=== { class=\\"sortable\\" ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  21  Jeff Foster  PF/C   Texas State - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  56  Tim Young  C   Stanford } ==RosterRegular seasonSeason standings=== :z - clinched division title :y - clinched division title :x - clinched playoff spot ===Record vs. opponents=== {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=301999-2000 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !008080;color:#800080;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000000;color:#5787DC;width=35\\"CLE !00008B;color:#008000;width=35\\"DAL !141A44;color:#BC2224;width=35\\"DEN !0C7674;color:#BB222C;width=35\\"DET !072E63;color:#DC5A34;width=35\\"GSW !002366;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !00471B;color:#5C378A;width=35\\"MIL !044D80;color:#000000;width=35\\"MIN !12305B;color:#C4CED4;width=35\\"NJN !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !000000;color:#BB9754;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !6846A8;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#992634;width=35\\"SEA !7436BF;color:#BE0F34;width=35\\"TOR !644A9C;color:#149BC7;width=35\\"UTA !0CB2AC;color:#000000;width=35\\"VAN !044D7D;color:#BC7A44;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  1–3  1–3  3–1  3–1  0–2  1–1  1–3  0–2  1–1  1–3  1–1  0–2  2–2  0–4  1–1  3–1  2–1  0–3  0–4  0–2  0–2  2–0  0–2  1–1  2–2  0–2  1–1  1–3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  3–1  —  1–3  2–2  2–2  1–1  2–0  0–3  1–1  1–1  1–3  1–1  0–2  1–3  1–2  0–2  3–1  2–2  2–2  1–3  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Charlotte  3–1  3–1  —  4–0  3–1  1–1  1–1  2–2  2–0  1–1  2–2  2–0  0–2  2–2  3–1  2–0  2–1  1–3  2–2  3–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–2  1–1  3–1  0–2  2–0  3–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Chicago  1–3  2–2  0–4  —  1–3  0–2  1–1  1–3  0–2  0–2  1–3  2–0  0–2  2–2  1–3  0–2  2–1  0–3  0–4  0–4  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  1–1  0–4  0–2  0–2  2–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cleveland  1–3  2–2  1–3  3–1  —  2–0  2–0  2–2  1–1  1–1  0–4  2–0  0–2  0–3  1–3  0–2  2–2  3–1  2–1  0–4  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–4  0–2  2–0  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Dallas  2–0  1–1  1–1  2–0  0–2  —  3–1  2–0  4–0  1–3  1–1  4–0  1–3  0–2  0–2  2–2  0–2  0–2  1–1  0–2  3–1  2–2  1–3  2–2  1–3  1–1  1–3  3–1  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Denver  1–1  0–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  1–3  —  1–1  2–2  2–2  0–2  3–1  1–3  0–2  2–0  2–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  2–0  1–3  2–2  2–2  1–3  1–3  2–0  2–2  2–2  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Detroit  3–1  3–0  2–2  3–1  2–2  0–2  1–1  —  2–0  1–1  1–3  2–0  0–2  2–2  3–1  0–2  2–1  1–3  2–2  2–2  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  2–0  2–2  0–2  2–0  2–2 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Golden State  2–0  1–1  0–2  2–0  1–1  0–4  2–2  0–2  —  1–3  0–2  1–3  0–4  1–1  1–1  1–3  0–2  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–4  0–4  1–3  0–4  0–4  0–2  0–4  3–1  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Houston  1–1  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  3–1  2–2  1–1  3–1  —  0–2  4–0  2–2  1–1  0–2  0–4  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  2–2  2–2  1–3  0–4  1–3  0–2  1–3  2–2  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Indiana  3–1  3–1  2–2  3–1  4–0  1–1  2–0  3–1  2–0  2–0  —  1–1  1–1  2–2  2–2  1–1  3–1  2–2  2–1  2–2  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  3–1  2–0  2–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  L.A.

The Access2Research Founders, Heather Joseph, John Wilbanks, Michael W. Carroll and Mike Rossner after meeting at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Access2Research is a campaign in the United States for academic journal publishing reform led by open access advocates Michael W. Carroll, Heather Joseph, Mike Rossner, and John Wilbanks. On May 20, 2012, it launched a petition to the White House to \\"require free access over the Internet to journal articles arising from taxpayer-funded research\\". The White House has committed to issue an official response to such petitions if they reach 25,000 signatures within 30 days. Access2Research reached this milestone within two weeks. On February 22, 2013, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and announced an executive directive ordering all US Federal Agencies with research & development budgets over $100M to develop public access policies within twelve months. The petition builds on previous campaigns asking scholars, publishers, funders, governments and the general public to remove paywalls to publicly funded scholarly research. It follows initiatives previously targeted at academics such as The Cost of Knowledge calling for lower prices for scholarly journals and to promote increased access to scientific information. The campaign refers to the NIH Public Access Policy as an example of a mandate that should be expanded to all federally funded research. == Endorsements == The campaign's outreach was supported on the first day of its launch by Creative Commons, the Public Library of Science, the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, RockHealth, Sage Bionetworks, The Cost of Knowledge, the Harvard Open Access Project, the Open Knowledge Foundation, the Open Science Federation, PatientsLikeMe and Lybba. It has been publicly endorsed by several other organizations, including the Alliance for Taxpayer Access, the Association of College and Research Libraries, the Association of Research Libraries, Arizona State University Libraries, BioSharing, The Center for Scholarly Communication and Digital Curation at Northwestern University, figshare, Genetic Alliance, InTechWeb, Mendeley and the Wikimedia Foundation. == Criticism == The petition has been criticized by a spokesperson for the Association of American Publishers who said they \\"oppose government mandates on research publications\\", whereas Public Library of Science co-founder Michael Eisen referred to the petition as a \\"compromise” that does not go far enough, pointing out that the NIH policy allows for delayed open access. == See also == * Access to knowledge movement * Fair Copyright in Research Works Act * Federal Research Public Access Act * Research Works Act * Academic Spring == References  External links == * Etherpad list of other organizational supporters of the petition * Archived copy of official site: Category:Open access projects Category:Academic publishing Category:Petitions Category:2012 in the United States Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Access2Research"},{"id":"35943704","text":"Rössing uranium mine, an open-pit mine near Arandis Uranium mining in Namibia is of considerable importance to the national economy. In 2018, Namibia produced 10% of uranium worldwide, ranked as the 4th largest producer, behind Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia. Uranium is one of the six mineral resources that were declared \\"strategic\\" by the Namibian government. Since the foundation of Epangelo Mining in 2009 no new exploration license may be granted without involvement by this governmental mining company. ==Background and history== Uranium mineralization was first discovered in the Namibia's Rössing Mountains, Namib Desert in 1928 by Captain G. Peter Louw. Though he tried promoting prospecting, it did not occur for another three decades. In the late 1950s, Anglo America Corporation of South Africa drilled and performed some underground exploration, but because of unstable uranium values and poor economic prospects, the search was abandoned. Uranium exploration was restarted in the country in the following decade, with Rio Tinto obtaining exploration rights for the Rössing deposit in 1966 and starting production in 1976. The United Nations held special hearings on \\"The plunder of Namibian uranium\\" in 1980. Jacob et al. reported in the mid-1980s that the country's uranium mineralization was concentrated in the central zone of the Pan-African Damaran Orogen. In 1999, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that the only operating mine in the county was the Rössing uranium mine, the largest uranium mine in the world. However, there has been a resurgence in the industry since 2003, and in 2008 uranium mine production in the whole of Africa increased by 16% compared to the previous year. Primary mines have since been opened, including Valencia, Ida Dome, and Goanikontes, as well as two secondary mines, Langer Heinrich (started in 2006) and Trekkopje (started in 2012). ==Notable mines and companiesRössing=== The Rössing mine contains the largest uranium deposit in the world associated with an igneous rock. Rössing Uranium is owned by Rio Tinto, the world’s largest mining group, which has annual profits of over $1.4 billion. It supplies enriched yellowcake uranium to power stations in France, UK, USA and Japan. The open-cast mine opened in 1976 and at one time faced closure. Rössing Uranium Ltd. processed about 12 million metric tons of ore in 2006 and produced 3,617 tons of uranium oxide (U3O8), and in 2009 they processed 12.6 million tonnes of uranium ore and produced 4150 tonnes of uranium oxide in comparison to 4067 tonnes in the previous year. ===Langer Heinrich=== Deposit from the Erongo Region When it opened in 2006, the Langer Heinrich mine was the first conventional uranium mine to be opened in the world in two decades. Langer Heinrich is now considered to have the greatest potential in the country, and saw a 59% increase to 1225 tons of uranium oxide in 2009, compared with 771 tons in 2008. ===Husab=== Swakop Uranium operate the Husab mine which is expected to be the second largest uranium mine in the world. Another deposit, the Ida Dome mine, is part of this project. ===Trekkopje=== The Paris-based multinational corporation Areva Group developed the Trekkopje Mine, but have decided to mothball the project. It is located of Swakopmund. In 2009, operations were estimated to produce about 100,000 metric tons per day of ore and about 3,000 tons a year of yellowcake. The company has built a desalination plant which is expected to be operating until around 2024. ===Norasa === Forsys Metals Corporation of Canada is developing the Valencia and Namibplaas uranium deposits, 40 km north of the Langer Heinrich mine. The company was granted a 25-year mining license in 2008 and, in 2009, announced the completion of an independent mineral resource study for Valencia. Measured and indicated resources were estimated to be 32,000 tones of U3O3- and 5,000 tons of U303+. It is expected to be producing from 2016 until about 2027. ===Etango=== Bannerman Resources Ltd. has an 80% interest in the Etango project, which is located southwest of Rossing Mine, about east of Swakopmund.

ABI/INFORM Global; ProQuest Research Library. Web. 26 May 2012. The \\"make.believe\\" campaign marked the first time any message has served to represent the company's entire range of products. Sony announced a brand strategy at IFA 2009 to replace the \\"like.no.other\\" moniker. The words \\"make.believe\\" form the \\"Sony Group Brand Message.\\" ==Sony's explanation of the phrase 'Sony Make.Believe'== The company described their campaign as follows: : make.believe symbolizes the spirit of our brand. It stands for the power of our creativity, our ability to turn ideas into reality, and the belief that anything we can imagine, we can make real. Sony emphasizes the importance of the period between \\"make\\" and \\"believe\\", saying it is \\"where imagination and reality collide.\\" Sony's Group Marketing Communication Department heads the \\"make.believe\\" project. Designers of the \\"make.believe\\" logo produced an animated version before producing a static one. They made versions in both 2D and 3D. The animation begins with light emerging from the center, while colored rays represent \\"make\\" and \\"believe.\\" A dot appears, followed by the words of the message. The designers found it difficult to effectively adapt the animation to a 3D context, and thus turned to Sony Pictures Entertainment and PCL for advice. Junichi Nagahara of Sony Creativeworks was asked to create sound for the animated logo. His superior, Nobuhiro Jogano, asked him to represent the sound of light, as well as the sounds of the words \\"make\\" and \\"believe.\\" The company even produced a surround sound version of the sound for the animation, concerned that a stereo version would distract audiophiles. Daigo Maesaka adapted the logo for the print medium, and put together simulations of recommended uses. ==Implementation== Following the announcement of the \\"make.believe\\" brand strategy, the company included the logo at the end of advertisements. Not until November 2009 did it launch its first advertisement. The ad, created by 180, illustrated a boy on a \\"magical journey\\" through the worlds created by Sony offerings. Sony expanded the initial ad to print, television, digital, and outdoor advertisements across Europe. The company launched the \\"make.believe\\" strategy in the United States in January 2010. Sony budgeted US$100 million for its \\"make.believe\\" campaign in 2010.Tarr, Greg. \\"Sony Seeks New 3D Dimensions, Marks 2nd Leg of make.Believe.\\" TWICE 25.13 (2010): 50-. ProQuest Research Library. Web. 26 May 2012. That same year, Sony rolled out the second portion of the campaign, focused on promoting its 3D offerings. It broadcast television advertisements featuring American football player Peyton Manning as well as pop singer Justin Timberlake. The ads were intended to teach consumers about 3D and reduce misconceptions about the technology. As a part of the push, the company planned to conduct several thousand demonstrations in retail settings, allowing consumers to see 3D technology first-hand. ==Reception== The Financial Times mocked Sony's tagline, arguing that it represented Sony's \\"make believe\\" attitude of ignoring serious problems.\\"Sony: Too Much make- Believe.\\" FT.com (2011): n/a.

The acquisition of Richardson along with other rookies Troy Murphy, and Gilbert Arenas sought to help with the Warriors struggles the past seasons. Instead, their struggles continued as head coach Dave Cowens was fired and replaced with Brian Winters after an 8–15 start. The Warriors suffered a ten-game losing streak in March and finished last place in the Pacific Division with a 21–61 record. Despite their continuing struggles, Richardson won the Slam Dunk Contest, and was invited to play in the Rookie Game during the All-Star Weekend in Philadelphia. He was also selected to the All-Rookie First Team.

Known for most of its length as the Maybank Highway, the state highway runs from a dead end in Rockville east to U.S. Highway 17 (US 17) in Charleston. SC 700 connects Charleston with James Island, Johns Island, and Wadmalaw Island in southwestern Charleston County. ==Route description== SC 700 begins at a dead end in the town of Rockville on Wadmalaw Island. The terminus is on the north side of Bohicket Creek, which separates Wadmalaw Island from Seabrook Island, a short distance east of Bohicket Creek's mouth on the North Edisto River. The state highway heads northeast as Maybank Highway, a two-lane road that passes by the Charleston Tea Plantation, the only working tea plantation in the United States, and near the Firefly Distillery, which is on Bear Bluff Road on the portion of the island north of Leadenwah Creek. SR 700 crosses Church Creek onto Johns Island, enters an outlying section of the city of Charleston, and arrives at the main crossroads of the island near the site of the venerable Angel Oak. Main Road heads north from the junction through the northern part of the island before crossing the Stono River on the John F. Limehouse Memorial Bridge to meet US 17 between Rantowles and Charleston. Bohicket Road heads south toward Seabrook Island and Kiawah Island. SC 700 continues east and near the eastern end of the island intersects River Road, which leads south to Charleston Executive Airport. SC 700 expands to four lanes and crosses Pennys Creek and the Stono River on the high-level Paul Gelegotis Bridge and enters James Island. The highway passes through a golf course and along the south side of the historic Riverland Terrace neighborhood. SC 700 continues into a commercial area where the highway has a wye-type junction with SC 171 (Folly Road) west of the McLeod Plantation and Charleston Country Club. Old Folly Road is used for the movements from eastbound SC 700 to southbound SC 171 and from northbound SC 171 to westbound SC 700. SC 700 and SC 171 head north concurrently on Folly Road, which has two lanes northbound and three lanes southbound. The highways enter the West Ashley section of Charleston by crossing Wappoo Creek, part of the Intracoastal Waterway, on a drawbridge named for Burnet R. Maybank. SC 700 and SC 171 diverge at a directional intersection that does not allow access from southbound SR 171 to eastbound SC 700. SC 171 heads north as Wesley Drive and is used to access southbound US 17 (Savannah Highway) and SC 61 (St. Andrews Boulevard). SC 700 heads northeast as five-lane Folly Road (three lanes westbound and two lanes eastbound) to its eastern terminus at a partial interchange with US 17 just west of the U.S. Highway's interchange with SC 61 and its bridges over the Ashley River. The interchange allows access between SC 700 and US 17 in the direction of the peninsular section of Charleston. ==Major intersectionsReferencesExternal links== *The Highways of South Carolina: SC 700 700 South Carolina Highway 700 Category:Transportation in Charleston, South Carolina ","title":"South Carolina Highway 700"},{"id":"35943781","text":"Intercourse, subtitled Contemporary Canadian Writing, was a literary magazine published in Montreal from 1966 to 1971.

For the first time in nearly a decade, the Warriors reached the .500 mark late in the season with a 30–30 record as of March 4. However, they would win just eight of their final 22 games to finish sixth in the Pacific Division with a 38–44 record. Second-year guard Gilbert Arenas was named Most Improved Player of The Year, and second-year star Jason Richardson won the Slam Dunk Contest in Atlanta for the second year in a row. Following the season, Arenas signed as a free agent with the Washington Wizards, Antawn Jamison and Danny Fortson were both traded to the Dallas Mavericks, Bob Sura was dealt to the Detroit Pistons and Chris Mills retired. ==Draft== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" - ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 002366; color:#FFB300\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  3  Mike Dunleavy Jr.  SG   Duke - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  30  Steve Logan  PG   Cincinnati } ==RosterRegular seasonSeason standings=== :z - clinched division title :y - clinched division title :x - clinched playoff spot ===Record vs. opponents=== {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=302002-03 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000000;color:#5787DC;width=35\\"CLE !0055BA;color:#898D8F;width=35\\"DAL !141A44;color:#BC2224;width=35\\"DEN !006BB7;color:#ED164B;width=35\\"DET !072E63;color:#DC5A34;width=35\\"GSW !002366;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#0CB2AC;width=35\\"MEM !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !00471B;color:#5C378A;width=35\\"MIL !044D80;color:#000000;width=35\\"MIN !12305B;color:#C4CED4;width=35\\"NJN !0093B1;color:#FDB827;width=35\\"NOH !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !000000;color:#BB9754;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !6846A8;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#FFC322;width=35\\"SEA !7436BF;color:#BE0F34;width=35\\"TOR !644A9C;color:#149BC7;width=35\\"UTA !044D7D;color:#BC7A44;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  0–3  2–2  4–0  0–2  2–0  1–3  0–2  1–1  2–2  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–3  2–2  0–2  1–3  2–2  1–3  2–1  3–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–3  1–1  2–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  3–0  —  2–2  4–0  0–2  1–1  2–2  1–1  0–2  2–2  2–0  1–1  2–0  2–2  1–2  2–0  1–3  3–1  4–0  3–2  2–2  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–2  2–0  1–2  1–1  1–3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Chicago  2–2  2–2  —  3–1  0–2  1–1  0–4  1–1  1–1  2–2  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–2  2–2  0–2  2–2  1–3  2–1  1–3  1–3  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–2  2–2  1–1  1–3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cleveland  0–4  0–4  1–3  —  0–2  1–1  0–4  1–1  1–1  0–4  2–0  1–1  0–2  1–2  0–4  0–2  2–2  1–3  1–2  0–4  0–4  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  1–1  3–1  1–1  0–4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Dallas  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  —  4–0  2–0  4–0  4–0  1–1  4–0  1–3  4–0  2–0  0–2  2–2  2–0  2–0  2–0  1–1  2–0  2–2  2–2  1–3  2–2  2–2  2–0  2–2  2–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Denver  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  0–4  —  0–2  0–4  0–4  1–1  1–3  0–4  2–2  2–0  1–1  0–4  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  1–3  2–2  0–4  1–3  1–3  1–1  0–4  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Detroit  3–1  2–2  4–0  4–0  0–2  2–0  —  1–1  2–0  2–2  1–1  1–1  2–0  3–1  1–3  1–1  2–1  2–2  2–2  2–1  2–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  3–1  2–0  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Golden State  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  0–4  4–0  1–1  —  1–3  1–1  2–2  2–2  2–2  1–1  0–2  1–3  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  2–0  2–2  0–4  0–4  1–3  2–2  2–0  2–2  2–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Houston  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  0–4  4–0  0–2  3–1  —  1–1  2–2  2–2  3–1  1–1  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  2–0  2–0  3–1  1–3  2–2  1–3  2–2  2–0  1–3  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Indiana  2–2  2–2  2–2  4–0  1–1  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  —  2–0  0–2  1–1  4–0  3–1  2–0  1–2  3–1  3–1  2–1  2–2  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–2  2–0  3–1  1–1  2–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  L.A.

Fortuna Düsseldorf beat Hertha BSC in the Promotion/Relegation Playoff to earn a spot in the 2012–13 Bundesliga season. The sports court and the Federal Court of the German Football Association (DFB) confirmed the club's promotion after Hertha BSC appealed the result of the second leg and lost on both accounts. The club also takes part in the 2012–13 edition of the DFB-Pokal, the German Cup, where it reached the second round and will face fellow Bundesliga side Borussia Mönchengladbach next.DFB-Pokal 2012/2013 .:.

The ban is for celebrating with a torch in his hand after the second leg of the Promotion/Relegation playoff when Fortuna defeated Hertha BSC on aggregate. The disciplinary panel of the German Football Association decided that Fortuna must play their first home match with no supporters for the supporters running onto the field during the second leg of the promotion/relegation playoff. The club was also hit with a €100,000 fine. After an appeal, the ban on supporters inside the stadium for the first home match was overturned and are now limited to 25,000 supporters for the first two home matches which includes 5,000 visiting supporters. However, the €100,000 fine was increased to €150,000.

It is located in exposures of the Allenby Formation on the east bank of the Similkameen River, south of the town of Princeton, British Columbia. ==History== The Princeton Chert (Ashnola shale in older sources) and its fossils have been known since the 1950s, but have attracted increased attention in the late 1970 and on. This may be due to the rare type of silica permineralized fossil Lagerstätten found, which has preserved plants and animals in minute 3D detail, with exceptional internal cellular detail. This has meant anatomical descriptions and reconstruction of whole plants from isolated parts has been possible in many species. Few plant fossils elsewhere in the world exhibit such excellence in both preservation and diversity. Similar aged fossil beds in Eocene lake sediments are found elsewhere in British Columbia, including in Driftwood Canyon Provincial Park near Smithers in northern British Columbia, the McAbee Fossil Beds west of Kamloops, about NNW of the Princeton Chert beds, and the Klondike Mountain Formation around Republic, Washington, south of Princeton. ==Location and geologic setting== The Princeton Chert is an interbedded sequence consisting of coal, shale, volcanic ash, and chert in the Allenby Formation. 49 chert layers, ranging in thickness from have been recognized and described, though each is not unique in organisms preserved. Despite this, trends are evident throughout the outcrop, with certain taxa appearing and disappearing with time. The Princeton Chert was originally considered to be Middle Eocene based on data from mammals, freshwater fish, and potassium-argon dates. Recently, more accurate radiometric techniques provided a date of 48.7 mya, placing the Princeton Chert in the Ypresian stage (47.8–56.0 mya), consistent with the whole Allenby Formation being now dated radiometrically as being Early Eocene. The climate at this time was warm; it had reached a maximum during a series of warming events during the Early Eocene with the Princeton Chert likely deposited after the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 and during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. During this time the sea warmed approximately 4 °C and terrestrial temperatures were several degrees warmer than today, meaning little or no ice was present at the poles. The temperature difference between poles and equator was small. This long term warmth is thought to be due to increased greenhouse gases, particularly CO2 trapping more heat. The reason for this sudden increase in CO2 is unknown, but it is hypothesised that it was due to an increase in ocean floor being recycled via volcanic arcs and metamorphic decarbonation reactions. This happened because the ocean between India and Asia was disappearing and being replaced by the Himalayas and the Tibetan plateau due to the collision of tectonic plates. Also at the time, Australia, which was joined to Antarctica, was beginning to move northwards.Scotese, C. R. (2003) Paleomap Project. [Online]. Available from: http://www.scotese.com/ [Accessed 18/03/2012]. Close up of Princeton Chert outcrop showing volcanic ash (white layer at base), peaty coal (dark layer), and Chert layers (grey). Layer 36 is labelled.The Princeton Chert fossils indicate that the area was an aquatic ecosystem, growing in tropical to subtropical conditions. More recent analysis of the fossil flora, however reconstructs for the Princeton Chert flora a moist warm temperate climate with mean annual temperature 13.1 ± 3.1 °C, with mild winters (cold month mean temperature 5.3 ± 2.8 °C), and mean annual precipitation 114 ± 42 cm per year. Several of the smaller chert layers are separated by volcanic ash layers, indicating nearby volcanic activity. It is thought that fossils were pervaded with silicic acid due to this volcanic activity. Subsequently, water charged with minerals flowed from springs or geysers into the low lying basin where the Princeton chert was located. Here, the water surrounded organisms as they grew, along with plant debris which had been accumulated. Many organisms were preserved in situ, in the lake or small pond environment in which they lived. The preservation must have been rapid, due to the minute cellular detail which has been conserved. This sequence of events is thought to have been replicated up to 50 times, as the basin allowed peat to re-accumulate each time, producing the multiple layers. ==Fossil biota== Sampling into the Princeton Chert has been carried out, but presently the data has not been analysed in detail. Across the outcrop, trends in taxa can be seen; in the topmost layers fossil organs of Metasequoia milleri cease to be represented, yet Pinus (pine) and monocotyledons increase in number. There is a huge increase in ferns, such as Dennstaedtiopsis, after a huge ash fall, though few angiosperms occur in these layers. A large number of angiosperms have been found along with several types of conifers, ferns, and several unidentified fossils from various families. ===In situ lacustrine fossils=== The array of floral and faunal fossils found in the Princeton Chert has offered unequivocal evidence that it was a lacustrine or lake environment. The plant fossils found show many structural and anatomical adaptations to an aquatic environment, including a reduced vascular system, aerenchyma in tissues (air spaces to provide buoyancy), and protoxylem lacunae surrounded by a ring of cells with thickened inner walls. Further evidence is provided by the fossils’ clear affinities with modern aquatic angiosperms. Many extant plants show these adaptations and are similar to the organisms found in the chert. For example, water lilies (Allenbya, Nymphaeaceae), water plantains (Alismataceae), arums (Keratosperma, Araceae) and rushes and sedges (Ethela, Juncaceae/Cyperaceae) are just some of the angiosperms found both today and in the Princeton Chert. Seeds have also been found which share adaptations with living aquatics. On the other hand, terrestrial fossils have rarely been found. The few that are, are represented mainly by seeds, some of which may have been transported by birds. Additional support for the aquatic nature of the Princeton Chert deposits comes from animal fossils. Several fossils of a freshwater fish, Amia (bowfin), have been found in the shale overlying the plant deposits, along with remains of the freshwater fishes Amyzon and Libotoniusm, and a soft-shelled turtle. Once the lacustrine nature of the fossils has been established, it seems fairly likely they were preserved in situ, especially considering the method of preservation. The growth position, large number of plant organs of the same type, preservation of delicate plant material, and presence of rooted axes all provide further evidence for the preservation of plants where they grew. ===Fungi=== Pathogenic fungi have been recorded on the leaves and other organs of some vascular plants. Fossil Uhlia palms have tar spot fungi on their leaves known as Paleoserenomyces. These fungi are in turn parasitized by a mycoparasite, Cryptodidymosphaerites princetonensis. Symbiotic mycorrhizal relationships have also been discovered in roots of Pinus and Metasequoia.

MacDonald, I. R., et al. \\"Asphalt volcanism and chemosynthetic life in the Campeche Knolls, Gulf of Mexico.\\" Science 304, no. 5673 (2004): 999-1002. Located southeast of the Sigsbee Knolls, the Campeche Knolls are bounded by Campeche Bank to the East, the Bay of Campeche to the South, and the salt-free abyssal plain called the Veracruz Tongue to the West. Salt deposition is inferred to have occurred in the Late Jurassic, during the rifting stage of the gulf, equivalent to the Louann Salt of the Texas-Louisiana slope.Ding, et al. 2010. Ding, F., V. Spiess, I. R. MacDonald, M. Bruning, N. Fekete, and G. Bohrman. \\"Shallow sediment deformation styles in north-western Campeche Knolls, Gulf of Mexico and their controls on the occurrence of hydrocarbon seepage.\\" Marine and Petroleum Geology 27 (2010): 959-972. Multibeam echosounder images collected during R/V Sonne cruise SO174 show the northern Campeche Knolls as distinct, elongated hills that average in size, with reliefs of and slopes of 10 to 20 percent. The Campeche Knolls are covered with a thick column of sediments above the salt unit, with sediment thickness reaching depending upon water depth and distance from the southern coast. The thick sediments provided prolific petroleum source rocks with the most productive one being of latest Jurassic and Cretaceous age. Hydrocarbon generation makes Campeche Knolls a highly ranked and prolific petroleum region, with studies showing that salt activity supports leakage of gas and oil. The potential for gas hydrate accumulations in the Campeche Knolls was demonstrated as early as 1970, with the retrieval of gassy cores from Site 88 drilled during Leg 10 of the Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP). DSDP Site 88 was drilled to demonstrate that the topographic high seen on profiler records was a salt diapir. During the course of drilling, a significant increase in the gas content of recovered cores to a depth of 108 mbsf (354 fbsf) occurred.DSDP Leg 10 Shipboard Science Party 1973. DSDP Leg 10 Shipboard Science Party. \\"Site 88 Initial Report.\\" In DSDP Leg 10, 55-70. Washington, D. C.: U.S. Govt. Printing Office, 1973. Of the five cores recovered, four had high levels of H2S and other natural gases. When these cores were brought on board the ship, irregular degassing characteristics were observed, with the cores emitting very large quantities of gas, estimated to be ten times the volume of the core, that required special measures (i.e. drilling of vent holes in the core liner) to prevent complete disruption of core sediments.Worzel and Bryant 1973. Worzel, J. L., and W. R. Bryant. \\"Regional aspects of deep sea drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, leg 10.\\" In Initial Reports of the Deep Sea Drilling Project – Galveston, Texas to Miami, Florida, v. 10, 737-748. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Govt. Printing Office, 1973. Degassing the cores also took an abnormally long time of over two hours. These perplexing results have since led the shipboard researchers to believe that gas hydrates were present in the core and would explain the high volumes of gas locked in the small quantity of water filling the sediment pore spaces and the long degassing time. During the R/V Sonne SO174 research cruise in 2004, remote sensing results guided researchers to the discovery of oil, gas, and asphalt seepage on the top of one knoll in the northern tip of the Campeche Knolls province. This knoll was named Chapapote, the Aztec word for “tar,” and is located at 21° 54’ N by 93° 26’ W in approximately 1.8 mi (3, 000 m) water depth. Extensive surface deposits of solidified asphalt are present at Chapapote, with one subcircular-shaped flow measuring at least across. A diverse biological community is also present on the Chapapote, with a range of organisms, including tubeworms, bacterial mats, and chemosynthetic mussels all calling the area home. A sample grab conducted on the cruise recovered sediment with thin layers of gas hydrate. Molecular and isotopic compositions of the gas hydrate indicated that the gas was moderately mature and thermogenic in nature. In 2006, the METEOR Cruise No. 67 (MC67/2b) returned to Chapapote. Hydrates were recovered at one gravity coring station, with Core 10618-1 containing a large piece of pure, white gas hydrate embedded in asphalt. The recovery of this core was accompanied by a strong rising of gas bubbles to the sea surface. It is assumed that hydrate formed internally after deposition of the asphalt.Bohrman and Spiess 2006.

Of the three samples collected from upper first meter of the core, two were composed of Structure I hydrate. The third was a mixture of both Structure I and Structure II.Klapp, et al. 2010. Klapp, S. A., et al. \\"Mixed gas hydrate structures at the Chapopote Knoll, southern Gulf of Mexico.\\" Earth and Planetary Sciences Letters 299 (2010): 201-217. Hydrocarbons from the Chapapote are dominantly thermogenic in origin as evidenced by the stable carbon isotopes of hydrate forming hydrocarbons. ==Importance of Campeche Knolls as a gas hydrates study site== The Chapapote asphalt volcano is located in the Campeche Knolls.It was there that the deepest known recovery of surficial gas hydrate occurred at a water depth of 1.8 mi (3,000 m). The gas hydrate was embedded in an asphalt matrix. Analyses of the hydrate showed both Structure-I and Structure-II gas hydrate present in the recovered sample. The only known recovery of gas hydrate in the southern Gulf of Mexico also occurred in the Campeche Knolls.Hutchinson 2011. Hutchinson, D. R., Ruppel, C. D., Roberts, H. H., Carney, R.

He also tries to create work-saving devices, such as a clothesline pulley system to bring luggage back and forth from the hotel to the train.

Another time, he turns the Shady Rest into a weight-loss camp. And he even buys a buffalo in order to lure wealthy British hunters to the hotel. He often enlists Billie Jo, Bobbie Jo, and Betty Jo in his schemes, much to Kate's chagrin.

The sculpture is thought to have been created by Jaume Barba, although others have claimed that its idea was conceived by Joan Fontbernat. The sculpture depicts death, in the form of a winged skeleton, planting a kiss on the forehead of a handsome young man. The sculpture elicits varying responses from the people that view it: is it ecstasy on the face of the young man, or resignation? ==Background== The sculpture is found above the grave of the textile manufacturer Josep Llaudet Soler. and was created in 1930. The tomb underneath contains the inscription: ::\\"His young heart is thus extinguished. The blood in his veins grows cold. And all strength has gone. Faith has been extolled by his fall into the arms of death.

It is loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe's 1843 short story \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\". The production of this film has been the subject of many episodes of Film Riot, an Internet television show hosted by Connolly. Many of the crew that worked on the film also feature in Film Riot, and the effects used in the film have been explained in detail as part of the programmes. ==Plot== Taylor (Todd Bruno) argues with his girlfriend Jenny (Shana Eva), before taking a hammer from his car and murdering her. He then wraps her body in a sheet, takes her upstairs, and hides her in his attic. He then phones Ray (Tim Connolly) and informs him of the crime. Referencing an earlier conversation in which a drunken Ray had suggested murdering Jenny, Taylor tries to convince him to help cover up the crime. Ray declines, leaving Taylor to deal with the consequences alone. He begins to clean the blood from the kitchen floor, and hears something moving in the attic. He goes to investigate, and hears Jenny screaming. Whilst investigating, he finds blood dripping from the loft hatch, and goes up to investigate, where he finds the body as he left it. As he climbs back down the ladder, he slips on the blood, and is knocked unconscious. On regaining consciousness, Taylor finds blood on his forehead, and looks up into the still-open attic, where he sees a hallucination of Jenny looking down at him. He goes to the bathroom and cleans the blood from his hands, head, and clothes, and finishes cleaning the kitchen. Terra (Brigitte Kali Canales), Jenny's friend, arrives, and finds that Jenny is missing. Taylor tells her that she has walked out, and left her phone. Fearing that Terra knows of the murder, he arms himself with a kitchen knife, but she leaves before he attacks her. Whilst disposing of the blood- stained towels used to clean the kitchen, Taylor takes a saw from his garage, and takes Jenny's body into the bathroom. Once he has put the body in the bath, Taylor closes Jenny's eyes, and prepares to cut her arm off. However, he is interrupted at the last moment by the shower curtain moving. He goes to investigate, and looks back to find Jenny's eyes now open again. The curtain moves again, and Taylor jumps back, hits the light switch, and falls to ground. The curtain is then pulled back and Taylor sees Jenny's bare foot touch the carpet. In terror, he flees from the bathroom and then the house. Whilst outside, a police car pulls up, causing Taylor to return to the house. When Police Officer Diaz (Adriana Pascual) knocks on the door, Taylor feebly tries to stop her from entering the house. When she does, she begins to search the ground floor and, on finding nothing, goes to search upstairs. Taylor again attempts to convince her that there is no issue but is ordered to remain downstairs whilst Diaz searches the upper floor. Diaz does not enter the bathroom, and therefore does not discover Jenny's body, but Taylor stabs her in the neck as she turns to leave. The two struggle silently, with Taylor pushing Diaz's gun down into its holster to protect himself. He is interrupted by an apparition of Jenny standing at the door, giving Diaz time to draw her weapon and shoot him. The two separate, and fall against opposite sides of the room, where they sit against the walls, dying. == Cast == Tells cast is made up of family and friends of Connolly, as well as professional actors. * Todd Bruno as Taylor: A timid and weak-minded man who murders his girlfriend, Jenny. This action haunts him, and his guilt eventually drives him insane. He is killed when Police Officer Diaz shoots him in self defence. Taylor's role is equivalent to that of the narrator in \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\". As with the story, the film is shot from Taylor's perspective, allowing the audience to experience his hallucinations, though it is never confirmed whether he is hallucinating or if the spirit of his girlfriend is genuinely haunting him. * Shana Eva as Jenny: Taylor's sharp-tongued live-in girlfriend. The two argue regularly when Taylor fails to return home in the evenings, and does not provide a reason. During one such argument, Taylor hits her with a hammer, killing her. He then hides her body in their attic, before returning later in the evening to dispose of it. Throughout the film, Taylor sees hallucinations of Jenny, driving him mad. Jenny is the equivalent of the victim in \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", although the motive and method of murder differ from the original story. * Tim Connolly as Ray: Ray is a friend of Taylor. One night, whilst drunk, Ray jokingly suggests to Taylor that he should hit Jenny the next time she shouts at him. Taking this for a serious proposition, Taylor acts on this suggestion by fatally striking Jenny and then phoning Ray for help. Ray, disgusted, and initially believing Taylor is joking, refuses to help after realizing the truth behind Taylor's call. * Brigitte Kali Canales as Terra: Terra is Jenny's friend. Terra receives a call from Jenny shortly before being murdered, prompting her to visit the house. Taylor convinces her that Jenny walked out after their argument, and Terra leaves, unaware of the truth, and that Taylor was ready to kill her should she find out. * Adriana Pascual as Police Officer Diaz: Diaz is called to Taylor's house by local residents who heard the argument between him and Jenny. She investigates the house, and is attacked by Taylor, who is trying to cover up Jenny's murder. After a struggle, Diaz shoots Taylor in self defense. Diaz's character is the equivalent of the Police Officers in \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", although her counterparts in the story are not killed; instead, the narrator is driven so insane that he confesses the crime willingly. == Release == Tell was made available on May 23, 2012 for free via YouTube. Connolly promoted it on his Twitter account, and via the Triune Films Facebook page. It was featured by Short of the Week on May 25, 2012, and awarded a rating of 4.5 out of a possible 5. Digital Hippos also rated it 4.5/5, and Cole Abaius of Film School Rejects described it as a \\"stellar work on a shoestring budget.\\" Following its release, and positive audience reaction, a limited DVD and Blu-ray run was released on May 25, 2012, with an extra run being released on September 28. The released version included a behind the scenes documentary, outtakes, and a director's commentary by Connolly. Pre-orders of the original run included a copy of the shooting script, signed by Connolly. === Soundtrack === In February 2012, the music used in the trailer, composed by Vitaliy Zavadskyy, was released as a single on the iTunes Store.

A strand swamp or strand is a type of swamp in Florida that forms a linear drainage channel on flatlands. A forested wetland ecological habitat, strands occur on land areas with high water tables where the lack of slope prevents stream formation. Strands are more linear than the cypress dome swamps that form in more rounded depressions and are fairly similar to floodplain swamps that form further north along streams and rivers. For the most part, strand swamps occur south of Lake Okeechobee. Notable strand swamps include the Fakahatchee Strand and Corkscrew Swamp, where the trees are up to 700 years old and tall. The Fakahatchee Strand is a tree-filled channel of slowly moving water that is long and wide. Strand swamps are often dominated by bald cypress (Taxodium distichum). Shallower strand swamps may contain pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens). When either of these trees dominate, the strand is known as a \\"cypress strand\\". Outside of protected areas, most old-growth cypress trees in Florida along streams or lakes have been harvested for their rot-resistant wood. Beneath a strand swamp are layers of peat. Established strand swamps with a large amount of vegetation have deep peat layers. These deep peat layers can serve as a wick to draw water from underground into the swamp during droughts. ==List of species== Undisturbed strand swamps support a number of plant species: ;Epiphytes and vines * white twinevine (Sarcostemma clausum) * common wild-pine (Tillandsia fasciculata) * eastern poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) ;Herbs * giant leather fern (Acrostichum danaeifolium) * waterhyssops (Bacopa spp.) * toothed midsorus fern (Blechnum serrulatum) * sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense) * string lily (Crinum americanum) * royal fern (Osmunda regalis var. spectabilis) ;Shrubs * red maple (Acer rubrum) * pond apple (Annona glabra) * common buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) * strangler fig (Ficus aurea) * sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana) * wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera) * swamp bay (Persea palustris) * swamp laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia) * myrsine (Rapanea punctata) * Florida royal palm (Roystonea regia) * cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto) * coastalplain willow (Salix caroliniana) Strand swamps are also home to a number of animals, including Florida redbelly turtle (Pseudemys nelsoni), wood stork (Mycteria americana), wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), Florida black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus), and the endangered Florida panther. ==References== Category:Natural history of Florida Category:Plant communities of Florida Category:Swamps of Florida ","title":"Strand swamp"},{"id":"35944207","text":"Amboasary Sud is a town in Anosy Region, Madagascar.

College Station, Texas 361 pp. Baygalls are recognized as a discrete ecosystem by ecologist and the swamps have been described as \\"distinct wetland communities in the Natural Communities of Louisiana\\". Baygall swamps are most often found in the low laying margins of floodplains and bottomlands with little or poor drainage to the main creek, bayou, or river channel. Baygall or bayhead swamps found on slopes and hillsides are sometimes referred to as a forest seep or hanging bogs. Hanging bogs are typically found in hardwood-pine forests. Most baygall swamps are semi- permanently saturated, or flooded.Texas Parks and Wildlife. Ecological Mapping systems of Texas: West Gulf Coastal Plain Seepage Swamp and Baygall Retrieved 7 July 2020 Baygalls are relatively shallow wetlands that typically form on the terraces of forest slopes or on the margins of floodplains. The characteristics of a bayhead swamp are mostly broad, shallow drains, which can be found near margins of bottomlands and floodplains with little or no drainage. They most often receive a slow, but steady supply of water from seepage at the base of slopes and bluffs. Baygalls are relatively shallow wetlands, ranging from wet and saturated soils and leaf litter, to a few inches of stagnate or very slowly moving water, although some may occasionally be deeper depending on topography and rainfall. Most are also under closed or nearly closed canopies. Occasionally, larger and deeper baygalls may have open water at the center with floating vegetation such as the fragrant water-lily (Nymphaea odorata). High acidity levels distinguish baygalls from other wetlands and they often support plant communities that are distinct form adjacent areas. Sphagnum is often associated with baygalls. Sometimes referred to as acid bog baygalls, baygalls typically have very lowpH levels. Levels as low as 4.5 are not uncommon in the baygalls of the Big Thicket region of Southeast Texas, USA. The acidic waters that drain from baygalls can contribute significantly to blackwater rivers and creeks in the bottomlands. A baygall may be no more than a small pool or they can be a mile across. The Jack Gore Baygall Unit of the Big Thicket National Preserve at 12 square miles, is said to be is the largest in the world.Peacock, Howard (1994) Nature Lover's Guide to the Big Thicket. Texas A&M.; University Press. College Station, Texas. 169 pp. == Flora == Baygalls are typically found in densely forested areas. Over-story trees associated with baygalls include baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), swamp tupelo or swamp blackgum (Nyssa biflora), red maple (Acer rubrum), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), laurel oak (Quercus laurifolia), water oak (Quercus nigra), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana). Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) are usually associated with hanging bogs or forest seeps. Understory species include smooth or hazel alder (Alnus serrulata), swamp titi or leatherwood (Cyrilla racemiflora), sweet gallberry (Ilex coriacea), American holly (Ilex opaca), Virginia willow or sweetspire (Itea virginica), wax-myrtle (Morella cerifera), red bay (Persea borbonia), swamp redbay (Persea palustris), bamboo- vine (Smilax laurifolia), poison sumac (Toxicodendron vernix), possum-haw viburnum (Viburnum nudum), muscadine grape (Vitis rotundifolia).

A controversial figure in Peruvian politics, he is the founder and leader of the Alliance for Progress party, which has achieved recognition for being the first party of provincial origin to gain electoral popularity at national level since its foundation in 2001. Born into poverty to a family of twelve brothers in Cajamarca in 1952, Acuña pursued his higher studies at the National University of Trujillo, where he graduated as a chemical engineer. Simultaneously, he started in the education business by founding a prep-college academy, which would ultimately evolve into César Vallejo University, founded in 1991. In the years to come, he pursued graduate studies in education at the University of Lima, the University of Los Andes, and the Complutense University of Madrid; at the same time, he founded two more colleges, founding a multi-million dollar private college consortium with campuses throughout Peru, which he currently owns. Acuña gained political recognition when in October 2006 was elected Mayor of Trujillo, ending a forty-four year uninterrupted tenure of the Peruvian Aprista Party in the northern city.http://www.congresoalacip2017.org/arquivo/downloadpublic2?q=YToyOntzOjY6InBhcmFtcyI7czozNToiYToxOntzOjEwOiJJRF9BUlFVSVZPIjtzOjQ6IjMwNDIiO30iO3M6MToiaCI7czozMjoiNGQzOWFjNTNlZTZiZmU3MjFlYmYyZjQwZWQxN2Q2ZDAiO30%3D He was successfully reelected in 2010. Four years later, he was elected Governor of La Libertad, this time defeating the same party at regional level.http://www.regionlalibertad.gob.pe/noticias/regionales/5916-cesar-acuna- renuncia-a-la-gobernacion-regional-de-la- libertadhttps://laprensa.peru.com/actualidad/noticia-cesar-acuna-alcalde- trujillo-anuncio-candidatura-presidencia-16821 Ten months after being sworn in, he resigned as governor and started a full-scale presidential campaign for the 2016 general election.https://gestion.pe/peru/politica/cesar-acuna- postularia-presidencia-elecciones-2016-96053-noticia/ Considered a potential run-off nominee against frontrunner Keiko Fujimori, he was eventually disqualified by the electoral authorities after alleged vote-buying in a campaign trail. Throughout the campaign, he faced accusations regarding plagiarism in two of his graduate thesis', and of illegally self-appropriating a published work on education policy under his name, which authorship belonged to an associated educator.https://elcomercio.pe/politica/actualidad/otoniel- alvarado-sancion-indecopi-acuna-avala-mi-posicion-398764-noticia/ Since his failed 2016 presidential bid, Acuña has been considered potential candidate for the 2021 general election, although he has not commented on the matter.https://gestion.pe/peru/politica/cesar-acuna-confirma-participacion-de- app-en-elecciones-al-congreso-noticia/ ==Early life and education== Acuña Peralta family. César Acuña Peralta was born on August 11, 1952, in the Peruvian hamlet of Ayaque, Tacabamba District, Chota Province, Cajamarca Region. He is the third of twelve brothers. His parents were Héctor Acuña Cabrera and Clementina Peralta Alvarado, people dedicated to agricultural work. His parents had no formal education (only the father attended primary school). Acuña and his 11 siblings completed their primary and secondary studies at the Tacabamba National School for Boys and Girls. When he was 18 years old, he traveled to Trujillo and enrolled in the School of Engineering at the National University of Trujillo in 1972, graduating at the age of 23 with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. To cover his college expenses, he had to sell cañazo (strong liquor) that he obtained from the then Casa Grande sugar plantation. As a student, he founded the Prep-College Engineering Academy in 1980, thus beginning his career as an entrepreneur in education. This academy was located on Carrión Avenue. On November 12, 1991, Law 25350 was enacted, which created César Vallejo University. The college would expand throughout the country with campuses in Chiclayo, Piura, Chimbote, Tarapoto, Lima, Huaraz and Moyobamba. In 1996 he founded the Club Deportivo Universidad César Vallejo, which represents Cesar Vallejo University in Peruvian professional football, and the regional television network UCV Satelital. In 2001 he established the Señor de Sipán University in Chiclayo, and three years later the Harvard College of Piura. Finally, in 2007, he founded the Autonomous University of Peru in the populous district of Villa El Salvador in Lima. During the 1990s, Acuña attained a master's degree in College Management at the University of Los Andes (Colombia), a master's degree in Education Administration at the University of Lima, a Ph.D. in Education at the Complutense University of Madrid (Spain), and Post-Ph.D. in Communication, Education and Culture at the Saint Thomas Aquinas University (Colombia). ==Career== Acuña first ran for a seat in the lower house of the Peruvian Congress at the 1990 general election with the Socialist Left Alliance from La Libertad constituency. Although not elected, he started working towards founding his own political party. At the 2000 Peruvian general election, he was elected to Congress as an independent within the National Solidarity Party. Upon taking office, he quit the National Solidarity parliamentary caucus and former an independent bloc.https://peru.com/actualidad/politicas/cesar-acuna-verdad-se-opuso-al- gobierno-alberto-fujimori-noticia-440639 His term would be shortened to one- year following Alberto Fujimori's downfall and the convoking of new general elections for April 2001. At 2001 general election, Acuña was invited by Lourdes Flores to run for reelection with the National Unity coalition. At the time, he was in the final stages of starting his own political party. He was ultimately elected representing La Libertad constituency.http://www4.congreso.gob.pe/congresista/2001/cacuna/curriculum.htm On December 8, 2001, in Trujillo, Acuña founded Alliance for Progress, his own political party. Following this event, he quit the National Unity parliamentary caucus and formed an independent bloc once again. Throughout his full term in Congress, he led numerous bills regarding education business regulations, and was a member of the investigative committee's on corruption in the Fujimori regime. At the 2006 general election, Acuña invited fellow congressman Natale Amprimo to run for President of Peru with the Alliance for Progress nomination, and himself as his first running mate (which allowed him to run simultaneously for reelection to Congress). Although he attained the highest vote count in his constituency, the nationwide results were 2.3% of the popular vote, failing to pass the new electoral threshold. The presidential ticket itself attained 0.4% of the popular vote, placing tenth. ===Mayorship of Trujillo and Regional Governorship of La Libertad=== Following the 2006 general election's poor results, Alliance for Progress lost its party registration in the Elections National Jury alongside the rest of the parties that failed to pass the threshold. That same year, Acuña made his first mayoral bid in Trujillo. Considered an underdog throughout the entire campaign, his victory proved a major blow for the Peruvian Aprista Party, as the city is widely recognized as the Aprista party's birthplace and stronghold in the Peruvian north. He attained 56.5% of the popular vote. President of Peru and leader of the Peruvian Aprista Party, Alan García, lamented his party's defeat in Trujillo, being quoted by the press saying: \\"I cried on Sunday night because I never thought that Haya de la Torre's cradle and grave could be lost. It is a stab in the heart, I say it as a son. At some point I will recover Trujillo even if I have to be a candidate for mayor personally. Many good people from Trujillo have punished the disorders and the pride of some people there...\\". Acuña ran for mayoral reelection in 2010, defeating once again the Peruvian Aprista Party nominee, Daniel Salaverry, with 43.9% of the popular vote. After 7 years in office, he formally resigned to the mayorship in order to run for Governor of La Libertad in 2014. The region had been governed by José Murgia since 2003, and remained the last Aprista governorship at national level. Acuña ultimately won the election with 43.6% of the popular vote. Upon taking office in January 2015, Acuña led diverse infrastructure programs throughout the region, and constantly clashed with the new mayor of Trujillo, a former police colonel Elidio Espinoza, an independent who defeated Alliance for Progress the year prior. ===2016 Presidential nomination=== Acuña started to gain traction at national level polls in mid-2015. Considered a potential candidate for the presidency at the 2016 general election, he initiated an exploratory committee in September 2015. After 10 months in office, he resigned as Governor, and started a full-scale presidential bid with Alliance for Progress. Following his announcement, he started to gain momentum in the polls. In November 2015, he placed third for the first time, behind frontrunner Keiko Fujimori and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, and above Alan García.https://perusupportgroup.org.uk/2015/11/acuna-up-garcia- down/ His popular support was largely viewed by the media as a rejection towards the traditional political class. Upon registering his ticket, Acuña announced as running mates former Minister of Women and Social Development, Anel Townsend, and congressman Humberto Lay. Following this event, he announced the composition of the Alliance for the Progress of Peru coalition, which included his party, National Restoration, and We Are Peru.http://www.otramirada.pe/el-crecimiento-de-césar-acuña-con-universidades- y-sin-plan-de-gobierno His campaign was marked by controversy. During the month of January, he was accused of plagiarism in both his master's and Ph.D. thesis, at the University of Lima and the Complutense University of Madrid, respectively. Although he denied the allegations, the universities opened investigations against him. Amidst the scandal, he was also accused of plagiarizing an entire work titled Educative Policy, written by a professor of his, Otoniel Alvarado. Acuña claimed that both authors had agreed on releasing the work together on separate authorships, but Alvarado denied any agreement of sort, and proceeded to publicly denounce him for plagiarism. Acuña later commented on the issue by declaring to the press that he had not committed plagiarism, and that \\"it was just copying\\". Upon the numerous accusations against his persona, Francisco Miró Quesada Rada resigned as president of César Vallejo University. Acuña replaced him by naming former Prime Minister of Peru, Beatriz Merino, as the new president of his university.https://www.americatv.com.pe/noticias/actualidad/otoniel-alvarado- cesar-acuna-se-apropio-mi-libro-n217978 Following the previous events, Acuña was accused of attempted vote-buying during a campaign trail, as he offered money to a disabled young man for his future medical operation. Describing his gesture as \\"humanitarian aid\\", the Electoral National Jury proceeded to open an investigation. He was subsequently barred from the election, alongside another front-runner candidate, Julio Guzmán, for irregularities in the nomination procedure. Although his campaign team presented extensive appeals to the barring, it was ultimately not overruled His last poll appearance placed him fourth. Analysts viewed his barring from the election with Guzmán as a leverage for other candidates, mainly Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who managed to earn second place and qualify for the run-off against front-runner Keiko Fujimori. Kuczynski, a former ally of Acuña, was subsequently elected president in the run-off. ===Post-presidential bid=== Although his presidential nomination was barred from the 2016 election, Alliance for Progress obtained 9.2% of the popular vote at parliamentary level, gaining 9 out of 130 seats in the Peruvian Congress. Following the constitutional dissolution of Congress on September 30, 2019, by president Martín Vizcarra, his party obtained 10.0% of the popular vote and 22 out of 130 seats at the 2020 parliamentary snap election.https://ojo-publico.com/1589/alianza-para-el- progreso-tendra-el-mayor-bloque-regional-del-congreso Acuña has remained skeptical of running for the presidency in the 2021 general election, but keeps polling as potential nominee due to the strong popularity his party has achieved since the 2020 snap-election. ==Controversies== During the 2011 general election campaign, he was sanctioned five times for violating electoral neutrality in favor of his son and presidential candidate, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, in his position of Mayor of Trujilo.http://elcomercio.pe/politica/755600/noticia-sancionan-quinta-vez- alcalde-trujillo-vulnerar-principio-neutralidad In September 2011, the Prosecutor's Office ordered an experts opinion to the accounts of the universities of César Acuña for alleged money laundering, in response to the complaint made by his own wife, Carmen Rosa Núnez Campos.http://elcomercio.pe/peru/1269600/noticia-fiscalia-revisara-cuentas- universidades-cesar-acuna In June 2012, the National Office of Electoral Processes (ONPE) fined Alliance for Progress with more than 9 million soles for having received contributions ten times greater than the allowed limit from César Vallejo University. In May 2013, a video was released in which Acuña proposed to members of his party to \\"buy votes\\" to achieve his reelection as mayor of Trujillo, allegedly using public funds. Acuña admitted that he \\"bought votes\\" to achieve his reelection and that it does not seem like a bad thing to him, but denied that it was with public funds. That same month, another audio revealed that Acuña used resources from the Municipality's Treasury to improve his image as mayor of Trujillo. The dean of the School of Engineering of the National University of Trujillo, Masahiro Ywanaga Angulo, questioned the veracity of the diploma obtained by Acuña in said college. Claiming that Acuña entered the UNT in 1973, and finished studying in 1986, Masahiro points out that Acuña obtained 48 credits in a cycle in 1977 when the normal is 22, which pointed out irregularities in the qualifications. In 1980, Acuña asked to showcase his bachelor's thesis when he still had to pass courses to graduate, and later he took 8 courses, some of which were for the first, third and fourth cycles, which included courses that needed to have been completed and approved by others. The case remains unresolved. Acuña himself has denied any irregularities in his college education. In January 2016, at the start of his presidential campaign, he was accused of committing plagiarism in his Ph.D. thesis dissertation at the Complutense University of Madrid. In June 2017, the university released a statement declaring that the dissertation would not be annulled after investigations concluded there was no plagiarism. At the same time, he was accused of also committing plagiarism in his master's thesis at the University of Lima. Nine months later, the university verified that Acuña committed plagiarism in four modalities for his Master's thesis in Educational Administration: Literal copy without mentioning the source; mention of source and apparent paraphrase, but literal copy of the texts; mention of source and combination of paraphrase with literal copy; and taking ideas from another author without mentioning the source. Acuña publicly denied the allegations. ==See also== *Alliance for Progress == References == Category:1952 births Category:Alliance for Progress (Peru) politicians Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Trujillo, Peru ","title":"César Acuña"},{"id":"35944374","text":"Cerobasis longicornis is a species of Psocoptera from Trogiidae family that is endemic to the Canary Islands. ==References== Category:Trogiidae Category:Insects described in 1993 Category:Endemic fauna of the Canary Islands Category:Insects of the Canary Islands ","title":"Cerobasis longicornis"},{"id":"35944375","text":"Dahl is an unincorporated community in the town of Baldwin, St. Croix County, Wisconsin, United States. ==Notes== Category:Unincorporated communities in St. Croix County, Wisconsin Category:Unincorporated communities in Wisconsin ","title":"Dahl, Wisconsin"},{"id":"35944376","text":"Jordi Arrese was the defending champion and successfully defended his title, beating Alberto Berasategui in the final, 6–4, 3–6, 6–3. ==SeedsDrawFinals=Top Half=Bottom Half=References== * Main Draw Category:ATP Athens Open Category:1993 ATP Tour ","title":"1993 Athens International – Singles"},{"id":"35944390","text":"Heiko Maile (born 12 January 1966 in Sydney, Australia) is a German musician and composer.

It was released on August 28, 2012 in Australia and September 4, 2012 through Atlantic Records worldwide. It is the first album from the band to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 95,000 copies in its first week. It is also the first album of all new material that the band has released since More Than You Think You Are in 2002, although they recorded six new songs for their 2007 compilation album Exile on Mainstream. Finally, it is their first full- length studio album since rhythm guitarist Adam Gaynor's departure from the band in 2005. ==Background and recording== On September 4, 2010, while on VH1's Top 20 Music Video Countdown, Thomas stated that Matchbox Twenty was planning to start working on their next studio album in mid-September of that year. Due to the band members living in different locations, their first recording sessions took place in New York City, Los Angeles, and Nashville where Rob Thomas, Paul Doucette, and Kyle Cook were living, respectively. As a result of the different recording environments, the group amassed a large amount of material of various styles which could have become multiple albums. During a three-month period when the group was living and recording in Nashville, record producer Matt Serletic visited the studio where the band was recording and it was decided to have Serletic produce the final album. The band started with about 60 songs before spending three months in Nashville, which had dropped to around 20 songs when the band started recording at Serletic's Emblem Studios in Calabasas, California. The final album was cut down to 12 songs and was primarily recorded at Emblem Studios with additional recording at Electric Lady Studios, Studio Eleven:17, Sweatshop Studios, and Dark Horse Recording Studio. ==Release== The lead single from the album, \\"She's So Mean\\", was released on June 12, 2012. A promotional video for the second single, \\"Overjoyed\\", was released on August 28, 2012. The third single, \\"Our Song\\", was released on April 13, 2013. ==Promotion== In 2012, the band embarked on a worldwide tour, the North Tour, to promote the album.

Travis CI provides various paid plans for private projects, and a free plan for open source. TravisPro provides custom deployments of a proprietary version on the customer's own hardware. The source is technically free software and available piecemeal on GitHub under permissive licenses. The company notes, however, that the large number of tasks that a user needs to monitor and perform can make it difficult for some users to successfully integrate the Enterprise version with their own infrastructure. == Configuration == Travis CI is configured by adding a file named \`.travis.yml\`, which is a YAML format text file, to the root directory of the repository. This file specifies the programming language used, the desired building and testing environment (including dependencies which must be installed before the software can be built and tested), and various other parameters. == Operation == When Travis CI has been activated for a given repository, GitHub will notify it whenever new commits are pushed to that repository or a pull request is submitted. It can also be configured to only run for specific branches, or branches whose names match a specific pattern. Travis CI will then check out the relevant branch and run the commands specified in .travis.yml, which usually build the software and run any automated tests. When that process has completed, Travis notifies the developer(s) in the way it has been configured to do so—for example, by sending an email containing the test results (showing success or failure), or by posting a message on an IRC channel. In the case of pull requests, the pull request will be annotated with the outcome and a link to the build log, using a GitHub integration. Travis CI can be configured to run the tests on a range of different machines, with different software installed (such as older versions of a programming language implementation, to test for compatibility), and supports building software in numerous languages, including C, C++, C#, Clojure, D, Erlang, F#, Go, Apache Groovy, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Julia, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Swift, and Visual Basic. Several high-profile open source projects are using it to run builds and tests on every commit, such as Plone, Ruby on Rails, and Ruby. As of February 2013, over 8056 JavaScript projects use it. == Integration == Travis CI supports integration with external tools such as coverage analyzers or static analyzers. In the case of Coverity Scan, for instance, Travis CI can run the build stage under Coverity's cov-build tool, and submit the result for analysis if the build succeeds. == Company == The company is headquartered in Berlin, Germany and was founded in 2011. In 2012 the project experienced significant growth and launched a crowd funding campaign to fund further development which was sponsored by dozens of technology companies. In January 2019 it was announced that the company has been acquired by Idera, Inc.. A few weeks after the acquisition, a large portion of the old Travis team was fired. ==See also== * Continuous integration software * Comparison of continuous integration software == References  External links == * * Category:Continuous integration Category:Open-source hosted development tools Category:Free software programmed in Ruby Category:Internet properties established in 2011 Category:Software using the MIT license ","title":"Travis CI"},{"id":"35944633","text":"The 1898 North Carolina Tar Heels football team represented the University of North Carolina in the 1898 college football season.

It led to the resignation of the Asturian President, Juan Luis Rodríguez-Vigil. The scandal occurred at a time when there was a need to attract productive investment to Asturias because of a declining industrial structure. In October 1992, Jean-Maurice Lauze stated he was sent by the Saudi International Bank as a French intermediary to negotiate with the government of Asturias. His proposal was to make an investment of up to 100,000 million pesetas to build an oil refinery near the port of El Musel in Gijón. The negotiations lasted seven months, and the project was to receive a state subsidy of 1,000 million pesetas. The project was announced in May 1993, and was presented as one of the largest industrial investments ever made in Spain. Construction would begin in 1994 and was to be completed in 1998. The refinery, with a production capacity of 180,000 barrels a day, would create up to 4,000 jobs. A week after the announcement, and following an investigation by three of its editors, the newspaper Gijón Trade stated the project was a fraud. The Saudi International Bank confirmed that it had no knowledge of the project. The alleged New York bank that was to underwrite the operation did not exist. The Asturian government discovered that it had been deceived by an imposter. Rodríguez-Vigil and the Minister of Industry, Victor Zapico, each blamed the other. Zapico stated he had not received monetary compensation for the negotiations. A government spokesman suggested that the plan may have been conceived to discredit the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). Rodriguez- Vigil resigned in May 1993, citing reasons of \\"political dignity\\". Though he maintained his innocence, Lauze was convicted in July 1994 of forging official commercial documents. The court held that his certificates were forged in the Saudi Kingdom embassy in Madrid. The documents claimed that Lauze was the head of oil supply contracts with the state-owned Saudi Samareg. The petrochemical complex proposal was said to have been instigated by the Saudi International Bank, a financial organization of Prince Abdullah ibn Faisal ibn Turki Al- Abdullah Al-Saud. The forged documents were attributed to a Swiss notary, Roland Rochat. ==References== Category:Politics of Asturias Category:History of Asturias Category:Political scandals Category:1993 in politics Category:1993 in Spain ","title":"Petromocho"},{"id":"35944714","text":"Clube de Futebol Os Armacenenses (abbreviated as CF Armacenenses) is a Portuguese football club based in Armação de Pêra, Silves in the Algarve. ==Background== CF Armacenenses currently plays in the Campeonato de Portugal which is the third tier of Portuguese football.

As of August 2011, WMMS-HD2 had rebranded as \\"The Alternative Project\\". * Erika Lauren Logo as Alt 99.1, 2017-2020 On May 23, 2012, WMMS-HD2 began rebroadcasting over low-power Cleveland translator W256BT (99.1 FM) under the brand \\"99X\\". The move was the latest in a trend made possible by a May 3, 2010, decision by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Although low-power FM translators in the United States are generally not permitted to originate their own programming, the FCC decision affirmed that translators are free to retransmit the programming of HD Radio digital subchannels - effectively creating new analog \\"radio stations\\" on the FM band - and thereby expanding the potential audience of digital-only channels like WMMS-HD2 that require an HD Radio receiver. The translator's launch marked the return of alternative rock to the Cleveland radio market for the first time - via an analog signal - since WKRK-FM had dropped the format from its main broadcast in 2011. The first song to air over this new rebroadcast was \\"Gold on the Ceiling\\" by The Black Keys. WMMS program director Bo Matthews (Alex Guitterez) was named the program director for 99X, having been \\"integral\\" to its launch. As 99X, WMMS-HD2 continued to air Sixx Sense with Nikki Sixx, the syndicated mix of talk and rock hosted by Mötley Crüe co-founder Nikki Sixx; later, 99X would also air its weekend companion The Side Show Countdown with Nikki Sixx. On January 29, 2014, \\"Chris Tyler\\" Merluzzo was announced as the new program director for both WMMS and WMMS-HD2. Erika Lauren, co-host of The Alan Cox Show on WMMS, had begun hosting a local weekday morning music shift as of December 2015. On December 21, 2017, WMMS-HD2 dropped the \\"99X\\" brand and replaced it with \\"ALT 99.1\\", the latest in a series of iHeartMedia alternative rock outlets to adopt the \\"ALT\\" brand following its adoption by KYSR/Los Angeles in August 2013; the change may have been related to a branding dispute with iHeartMedia rival Entercom. On February 1, 2018, Jason Carr was announced as the new assistant program director for WMMS, as well as program director for WMMS-HD2. On June 29, 2020, fifteen stations owned by iHeartMedia in markets with large African-American populations, including WMMS-HD2, began stunting with a series of African-American speeches, interspersed with messages such as \\"Our Voices Will Be Heard\\" and \\"Our side of the story is about to be told,\\" with a new format slated to launch the following day at 12:00 p.m. On June 30, it was made official that WMMS-HD2 would be a charter affiliate of iHeart's new Black Information Network, which is an all-news format specifically geared toward African-American listeners; WMMS-HD2's analog translator simulcast over W256BT was unaffected. ===FM translator=== WMJI radio tower W256BT began on November 2, 2004 as W262BN, a mostly silent radio translator licensed to Lorain, Ohio, free to transmit at 100.3 MHz. On April 22, 2011, W262BN adopted the callsign W259BI; changed its frequency to 99.7 MHz; and moved its transmitter to a cell phone tower in North Ridgeville. On May 23, 2012, W259BI adopted the callsign W256BT; changed its frequency to 99.1 MHz; changed its city of license to Cleveland; and began airing an alternative rock format as a separate analog radio station. The WMJI radio tower currently serves as the site of the W256BT transmitter. {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + Broadcast translator for WMMS- HD2 - ! style=\\"width:75px\\"Callsign ! style=\\"width:80px\\"Frequency ! style=\\"width:110px\\"City of license ! style=\\"width:80px\\"Facility ID ! style=\\"width:75px\\"ERP ! style=\\"width:95px\\"HAAT ! style=\\"width:50px\\"Class ! style=\\"width:230px\\"Transmitter coordinates - W256BT 99.1 MHz Cleveland 154527 250 watts 253.9 meters D  } ==Current programming== WMMS-HD2 primarily airs all-news radio via the Black Information Network; local traffic and weather updates are provided via the Total Traffic and Weather Network.

WMMS-HD2 transmits text and images to HD Radio receivers, such as station IDs and artist and song information, known as Program Service Data (PSD); similarly, W256BT transmits text to compatible analog receivers via the Radio Data System (RDS).

He never actually reigned, because the country was occupied by French revolutionary troops from 1793 until after his death. == Life == He was the son of Louis, Prince of Nassau-Saarbrücken and his first wife, Princess Wilhelmine of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt (1751–1780). His parents' marriage was unhappy, so that Wihelmine retreated to Hallberg Castle, where she raised her son. He studied physics, first in Strasbourg and from 1782 to 1785 in Göttingen. Then he went on his Grand Tour. In 1786, he was in Berlin and in the spring of 1787 in Italy. On 14 May 1793 he had to flee when French troop attacked Neunkirchen castle. He entered Prussian military service. He had to watch when his ancestral castle went up in flames in October 1793. On 14 November 1793, he was promoted to colonel in the Prussian cavalry. In 1794 his father died and he inherited the title of Prince. However, Nassau-Saarbrücken was still occupied by French revolutionary troops and he could not rule his principality. In 1797 he died after a fall from a horse. Since he had no descendants, Nassau-Saarbrücken fell to his first cousin once removed, Prince Charles William of Nassau-Usingen (his father's first cousin). His half brother Adolph came of age in 1805 and resumed the title Prince of Nassau-Saarbrücken. == Marriage == He married on 6 October 1785 to Princess Marie Françoise Maximilienne of Saint Mauris-Montbarrey (2 November 1761 – 2 February 1838), the daughter of Prince Alexandre Marie Léonor de Saint-Mauris de Montbarrey. They left no issue. == Ancestors  References == * * Genealogisch-historisch-statistischer Almanach, p. 108 Online == External links == * * Biography of Henry Louis == Footnotes == Category:Princes of Nassau Category:People from Saarbrücken Category:House of Nassau Category:Prussian Army personnel Category:1768 births Category:1797 deaths Category:18th-century German people Category:German military personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars ","title":"Henry Louis, Prince of Nassau-Saarbrücken"},{"id":"35944745","text":"Geoff Charles (28 January 1909 – 7 March 2002) was a Welsh photojournalist. His collection of over 120,000 images is being conserved and digitised by the National Library of Wales. ==Biography== and his wife, Catrin, before leaving their mountain farm in Snowdonia Charles was born near Wrexham in the small community of Brymbo in 1909. He attended Grove Park School in Wrexham, where he was encouraged to study journalism by a teacher who observed that he had a talent for writing. He went on to study at the University of London, where he obtained a first-class diploma in journalism in 1928. He worked during the 1930s when the Depression meant that many found it difficult to get work. He worked on the Wrexham Star which was sold by unemployed people for a penny a copy. With his earnings he was able to buy his first Thornton-Pickard camera which used 3.5 x 2.5 inch glass plates. Charles was involved in one of the Wrexham Star's scoops when he was able to smuggle himself into the lamp room of Gresford Colliery following the disaster there in 1934. By counting the number of missing lamps and miners’ helmets, he realised that the then public figure of 100 miners lost was a significant underestimate, and organised a special issue of the paper with this information.Geoff Charles , William Troughton, Friend of the Library, Winter 2003, accessed July 2012 The final loss of life was 266.Book of Remembrance, Wrexham.gov.uk, accessed May 2012 In March 1936, the Wrexham Star was taken over by the Wrexham Advertiser which worked out well for Charles. He was offered the position of leading the photography department of Woodalls Newspapers. He then left to manage the Montgomeryshire Express where he met a reporter called John Roberts Williams. The two of them later worked together on the Welsh language newspaper Y Cymro., and together filmed, produced and directed one of the first movies shot in Welsh (Yr Etifeddiaeth, “The Heritage”). Charles spent the war years working to improve farming practices by improved information. After the war he again went to work for Y Cymro where John Roberts Williams was now editor.Obituary: John Roberts Williams, The Independent, October 30, 2004 Charles continued to document life through photography and one of his best- known images is used as the cover for Ioan Roberts's book about Charles —that of the poet and farmer Carneddog who had to move from his mountain farm near Beddgelert to live with his son in Hinckley. This image was published in Y Cymro in 1945. Charles took many photographs of Welsh life including the many cultural festivals called eisteddfodau (eisteddfods).Geoff Charles (1909-2002) at Flickr He also documented the loss of the Capel Celyn community under the river Tryweryn which was lost when it was flooded to create the Llyn Celyn reservoir for Liverpool. He covered the protest in 1956 when demonstrators who supported the threatened community travelled to Liverpool to hear the president of Plaid Cymru address the council. ==Preservation of images== Charles's collection of 120,000 negatives was donated to the National Library of Wales where they remained safely until the 1990s when it was discovered that the photographic negatives on triacetate film were destroying themselves due to a chemical reaction. The cellulose was decaying and creating acetic acid (vinegar syndrome) which would in time destroy the image. A technique has been developed that allows the image to be separated from the gelatin and cellulose and these are then replaced with a new polyester surface. Images have been scanned at 1200 dpi for display on the library's website at 75 dpi, \\"[suiting] the resolution of computer monitors; it also prevents illegal copying\\".

Construction began on 8 January 1639 after the original 16th century building was destroyed by fire. The chronicler Friar Agostinho de Monte Alverne wrote of the incident, noting that all was destroyed except the main body and the sacramental bread. To mark the occasion, the municipal council of Calheta decided to commemorate the event with a procession, ritual mass and sermon in 1664. These commemorative rituals were later provided for in the testaments of Captain-Major Bartolomeu Pereira and his grandson, Father José Soares de Sousa. The new church was built away from the sea on the site of a small chapel dedicated to Saint Catherine () which was destroyed during a volcanic eruption. It is believed that the construction of the current Church of Santa Catarina was begun in the 17th century. Building lasted for a considerable period and was only completed around 1763 as a result of the Mandado de Deus earthquake, which hit the island on 9 July 1757. The church did not have a baptismal font until 1664 when it was provided by visiting parish priest António Pires de Serpa. On 4 October 1945, the church was damaged by an ocean swell (some say tsunami). Major damage also occurred on 1 January 1980 as a result of the Azores earthquake which affected many of the islands of the Central Group, destroying much of Angra do Heroísmo. Plans for remodelling were prepared in the late 1980s and the church was reopened in 1991. ==Architecture== The church is located in the centre of the built-up area of the village of Calheta. On a platform located to the rear of the church the local community constructed an império, a religious building used in the Festivals of the Holy Spirit. The single-nave church is in the form of a cross, with a lateral transept, and has a belltower with a four-faceted clock. Inside, there is an apse in gilded wood with images of Saint Catherine (one from the small 16th century building, the other from the 17th century), and a valuable candelabra. { style=\\"background: transparent; margin: center;\\" ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * * == External links == Santa Catarina Category:Buildings and structures in Calheta, Azores ","title":"Church of Santa Catarina (Calheta)"},{"id":"35944763","text":"Signal Peak, with an elevation of , is the highest peak in the Pine Valley Mountains and in Washington County in southwestern Utah, United States.

Accessed: December 25, 2013. The story is centered on a Native American (Haudenosaunee) lacrosse team making its way through a prep school league tournament in Upstate New York. ==Plot== A mixed-blood Native American, Joe Logan aka \\"Logan the Legend\\" is eager to modernize his reservation's casino by expanding on the land of his ancestors, but first he must prove himself to his father, the traditionalist Tribal Chairman. The Chairman will only grant Joe's request on the condition that he meets his challenge - coaching the reservation's struggling high school lacrosse team, which competes against the better equipped and better trained players of the Prep School league. Joe reluctantly accepts, only to soon realize the challenge will require a leadership he had forfeited years ago as a star lacrosse player. Lost on how to reach his players, Joe finds that the answer lies deep in the traditional cultural heritage of the sport. Gaining the respect of his team, Joe helps them restore pride and return the game of lacrosse to their people. ==Cast== *Brandon Routh as Joe Logan *Chelsea Ricketts as Nadie Logan *Gil Birmingham as Ben Logan *Crystal Allen as Julie Gifford *Jack Vandervelde as Toby Gifford *Dennis Ambriz as Crooked Arrow *Robert Coffie as Crooked Arrow Fan *Kachina Dechert as Girl in Casino *Tyler Hill as Jimmy *Cindy Lentol as Baccarat Woman *Jerome Vincent as Reed *Lee Cunningham as Mrs. Logan (mother) *Jartivius Thompson III as Dane the Janitor *Stephen Serewicz as head of construction crew (forklift driver) The film features cameo appearances by former Tufts men's lacrosse coach and current Brown men's lacrosse coach Mike Daly, former Virginia Cavaliers men's lacrosse coach Don Starsia, Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse coach John Desko, and Syracuse Orange women's lacrosse coach Gary Gait; referees Tom Kitterick, Brian Lenane, and Bill Doherty; and lacrosse stars Paul Rabil, Zack Greer, and Brodie Merrill. ==ReceptionCritical reception=== On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 41% approval rating based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 5.36/10. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has an average score of 42, based on 13 reviews. The Austin Chronicles Marjorie Baumgarten commended the filmmakers for making tweaks to the underdog sports movie formula by putting a \\"novel focus\\" on a rarely seen sport within the context of Native American history but felt it was \\"predictable\\" overall. Kalvin Henely of Slant Magazine said, \\"Although it adheres to the tried-and- true sports movie formula of an underdog team striving to overcome their limitations to become winners, Crooked Arrows lacks captivating emotional momentum.\\" Farran Smith Nehme of the New York Post was critical of the cast of young lacrosse players being given stock characters and the sport itself not being explained in enough detail, saying the film overall comes across like an \\"after-school special.\\" Daniel M. Gold from The New York Times wrote, \\"Crooked Arrows gets points for its glimpses of Native American culture and history — the film’s backers include the Onondaga Nation — but too many of these scenes are disappointingly static. And the games themselves give little sense of the flow or exquisite precision of lacrosse. Splitting the difference between heritage film and sports flick, Crooked Arrows gets neither right, whiffing at an open net.\\" ===Box office=== In its opening weekend, the film grossed $257,364 in 55 theaters, ranking at #24 nationally. By the end of its run, Crooked Arrows grossed $1,832,541 domestically. ===Home media=== Crooked Arrows was released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 23, 2012. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:2012 films Category:Lacrosse films Category:Films directed by Steve Rash Category:Lacrosse of the Iroquois Confederacy Category:Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse Category:Films about Native Americans Category:American high school films ","title":"Crooked Arrows"},{"id":"35944782","text":"Map of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, 1857 This is a list of shipwrecks located off the coast of Massachusetts. ==Barnstable County== Due to its dangerously hidden and constantly moving shoals located just off-shore, Cape Cod's coastline from Chatham to Provincetown – a mere fifty-mile stretch of sea – has been called an \\"ocean graveyard\\", containing over 3,000 shipwrecks. { class=  style = \\"width:100%\\" ! style=\\"width:10%\\"  Ship ! style=\\"width:10%\\"  Sunk date ! style=\\"width:70%\\"  Notes ! style=\\"width:10%\\"  Coordinates - Alva 25 July 1892 A luxury yacht that was rammed in fog by the steamer H.

George Whytock, commander of the ship Rodney, of London, which sailed from Boston, on Thursday the 22d of November, and unfortunately was shipwrecked on Duxburough beach, the Sunday morning following, in the severe snowstorm, takes this public method to return his most grateful thanks to the benevolent people of Duxborough, Marshfield, and their vicinities, for their humane, spirited, and generousexertions, in affording him and his crew their assistance, in their distressing calamity. To ALL this tribute is sincerely proffered, and particuarly to Captain Samuel Debona [sic, Delano], of Duxburough, for his singularly benevolent, noble, and spirited exertions, who at the risk of his own life, ventured into the boisterous waves, and providentially reached the wreck, for the kind purpose of preventing the sufferers attempting to land in their then situation, but to wait until the tide would admit of their getting safely on shore, and to inspire their almost exhausted spirits every possible degree of fortitude, with the assurance of a ready assistance as soon as it was possible for help to reach them from the beach.

The Brig Success, Tobias Lear Porter, master, belonging to Messrs. J. & S. White of Salem, 84 days from St. Petersburg, on Wednesday evening last, struck on the Brant rock, Marshfield beach, by which accident the Captain, mate, and four seamen perished, two only being saved. The names of those lost besides the master, are, Mr. John Nichols of Salem, mate; Peter Union, John Chappell, Williams Brooks, and Giles Pike of Marblehead, seamen. Capt. Porter (in whose death society has lost a very respectable, enterprising, and valuable member) was son to the Rev. Nathaniel Porter, of Conway, N.H., a clergyman much respected for learning, and venerable for his age and piety. It appeared that on the approach of night, the wind blowing fresh at the eastward, Capt. Porter consulting his mate on the expediency of running in for the land, they being very short of water, having but about 3 gallons on board, and as they supposed they knew their situation (having spoken a vessel out for the land that day) on mutual deliberation concluded to run in; sounding several times in the evening until they shoaled the water to 17 fathoms. Concluding that they were on the northern shore they hauled off to the southward; shortly after they sounded and had 40 fathom water; continued their course to the southward until nearly 8 o'clock P.M. when they saw breakers, and immediately were ship and stood off - directly after which she struck. After beating for two hours she bilged and filled the cabin with water: the mate and people then left the cabin (except the two that were saved) and went forward and lashed themselves [to] the bows, being then quite out of water; sometime after the bows settled away in the cavity of the rocks, when all those lashed forward were drowned; the captain continued about the decks doing everything in his power for the preservation of the whole until after three o'clock A.M.; he then called to the people that were holding on the combings of the companion way, and asked if they were alive; they answered, though the water was nearly up to their mouths; in a few moments he was heard no more. His body was taken up together with those of the mate and the people that morning, and on the following Sabbath were carried into the meeting-house, where a sermon adapted to the occasion was preached to a large concourse of people by the Rev.

For this season, all Division One teams endorsed a decision to split both Zone A and Zone B into two groups of 12 teams each, increasing the total number of teams in the league to 48. It was decided that the first group from Zone A comprise teams from the Nairobi, Aberdares and Mount Kenya regions while the second group comprise teams from the Eastern, North and South Coast regions. The first group from Zone B is to comprise teams from the South Nyanza, Central and South Rift regions while the second group comprise teams from the North Nyanza, North Rift and Western regions. Winners from each of these four groups will play the winners from the other group in their zone in a two-legged play- off tie to determine who gains promotion to the Kenyan Premier League for the following season. On 25 April, the Football Kenya Federation decided to slash the league to 20 teams for the 2014 season. For that to happen, it was decided that the league will consist of top 5 teams in each zone (except the two teams that win the promotion play-offs) in addition to the two relegated Premier League teams. The remaining 29 teams will be relegated to FKF Division Two, which will begin next season, along with the 8 teams promoted from the Provincial League. Zone A =Zone A – Group 1= =Zone A – Group 2= Zone B =Zone B – Group 1= =Zone B – Group 2= Promotion play-offs The promotion play-offs were contested between the winners of each of the 2 groups in both zones, to determine the winners of the zones, who would be consequently promoted to the Premier League. The losers would still gain promotion to the National Super League. ==Domestic cupsPresident's Cup=== The 2013 FKF President's Cup began on 20 July ended on 17 November. ===Super Cup=== During the 2013 season there were 2 Kenyan Super Cup matches held.

The date is October 16, 2011, and much of the movie is revealed in flashback. Tim (Johnny Lewis) and Molly get married and move into Molly's childhood home. Strange happenings in the house soon plague the couple. Tim has to leave town for a few days, leaving Molly, a recovering heroin addict, alone. The film reveals a hidden underground shrine in the shed. In her childhood room, Molly hears something in her closet. Upon Tim's return, he discovers Molly naked and staring blankly into a corner of the bedroom, appearing delusional. Molly begins to record their neighbors, a little girl and her mother who live nearby. She encounters paranormal forces in the house and at work, where she hears a man singing the traditional song \\"Lovely Molly.\\" The next day, Molly's boss shows her the surveillance camera footage, which seems to show Molly being sexually assaulted by an unknown force. Molly becomes hysterical and is sent home. Her condition becomes worse as she films and talks to a dead deer, and attempts to seduce the local pastor. Fearing for her safety, Tim takes her to the doctor, but she is healthy. That night, Molly attacks Tim and bites his lips, nearly pulling them off. Terrified, Tim calls Molly's sister Hannah. In the basement, Hannah finds that Molly has been keeping a rotting deer that she stabs, screaming that their father told her Hannah killed him. Hannah says that she was protecting herself and the young Molly from their father, and asks Molly to come live with her. Molly giggles, saying that if she does, her father will kill Hannah's son Peter. Molly continues secretly filming the neighbor. As a distraught Tim sits with the young girl's mother on the couch, it is clear they are familiar, and she performs oral sex on him. Pastor Bobby visits Molly, who emerges naked, and the two embrace. Shortly afterward, Pastor Bobby is seen in the bathtub, dead and covered in bites. Tim goes home and finds the video camera playing, showing a recording of himself with the neighbour. Molly strikes him and kills him by stabbing him in the head with a screwdriver, the same way Pastor Bobby was killed. The police are later seen in the woods digging to reveal the body of the young girl as the mother sobs. Molly leaves the site and lies naked and sobbing on the floor until her attitude abruptly changes and she smiles. She walks out naked toward a tall figure with glowing eyes, a horse head, and the body of a man (resembling the demon Orobas). In the aftermath, the couple's house is up for sale. Time has passed with no answer as to Molly's whereabouts or her disappearance. In their old bedroom, Hannah finds the family photo album on the floor. In it, she sees that their father's face has been covered with horse heads from his frame collection. Hearing a noise from the closet, she opens it and in a trance-like state reaches towards something unseen, similar to Molly's discovery earlier. ==Cast== *Gretchen Lodge as MollyInterview: Gretchen Lodge on Lovely Molly Shock Till You Drop *Johnny Lewis as Tim *Alexandra Holden as Hannah *Ken Arnold as Samuels *Lauren Lakis as Lauren ==Production== Filming for Lovely Molly began in late 2010 in Hagerstown, Maryland, with Dahlgren Chapel being one of the locations filmed.Horror film crew strikes gold scouting for locations in Hagerstown Baltimore Sun ==Soundtrack== The score for Lovely Molly was composed by the Chicago-based post-rock band Tortoise, and recorded at John McEntire's Soma Electronic Music Studios.Pitchfork.com The title track \\"Lovely Molly\\" is an arrangement of the folk song \\"Courting is a Pleasure\\" (Roud 454), a traditional emigration ballad that has been recorded by artists such as The Stanley Brothers (in 1961), Norma Waterson (in 1977), and Nic Jones (in 1980).The song goes by a variety of names: Nic Jones used the 'Courting is a Pleasure' title, but the Stanley Brothers version was titled 'Handsome Molly', while Norma Waterson's was titled 'Meeting's a Pleasure': Mainlynorfolk.info ==Reception== Critical reception for Lovely Molly was mixed, with the film holding a 44% \\"rotten\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 39 ratings.Lovely Molly Rotten Tomatoes Lovely Molly received positive reviews from The New York Times and the A.V.

He belonged to the Altieri family, one of the noble families of Rome. ==Biography== Vincenzo Maria Altieri was born in Rome on 27 November 1724, the son of Girolamo Altieri, prince of Oriolo, and Maria Maddalena Borromeo.Biography in the Biographical Dictionary of Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church Two of his father's brothers, Lorenzo Altieri and Giambattista Altieri were cardinals, while two of his nephews, Alessandro Mattei and Lorenzo Girolamo Mattei would also later become cardinals. Altieri was made a protonotary apostolic on 3 October 1743, taking possession of that office on 24 August 1747, the same day he became a Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura. He served as prelate of the Sacred Congregation of the Council before being appointed vice-legate to Urbino in December 1755. On 11 November 1756, he was appointed vice-legate in Romagna, and in January 1758 became governor of Ancona. He was appointed to the Apostolic Camera in June 1764, returning to Rome and taking possession of that office in January 1765. He became president of Carceri at this time, then served as president of the Zecca from October 1765 to 1766. He was then president of Ripe from January 1767 through 1775. In April 1775, he returned to the Apostolic Camera in Rome. In May 1776, he became prefect of the papal household. Pope Pius VI made Altieri a cardinal in pectore in the consistory of 23 June 1777. This was published in the consistory of 11 December 1780. Altieri received the red hat on 14 December 1780, and was awarded the deaconry of San Giorgio in Velabro. He was appointed to the Sacred Congregations of Bishops and Regulars, Council, Acque and Good Government. In January 1783, he became cardinal protector of the Clerics Regular Minor. On 23 April 1787, he opted for the deaconry of Sant'Angelo in Pescheria; then, on 10 March 1788, for the deaconry of Sant'Eustachio; then, on 12 September 1794, for the deaconry of Santa Maria in Via Lata. At this point, he became the cardinal protodeacon. On 29 January 1798, he became Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals. In February 1798, Rome was invaded by troops of the French First Republic, who created the Roman Republic. Cardinal Altieri, who was by then gravely ill, was faced with the possibility of being imprisoned along with the other cardinals then in Rome. Rather than face the possibility of prison, Altieri resigned his cardinalate on 12 March 1798; Pope Pius VI reluctantly accepted his resignation on 7 September 1798. Altieri died in Rome on 10 February 1800.

With their deaths, Robinson left Ohio in 1907, enrolled in Columbia Law School, and received his law degree in 1910. ==Legal career== After receiving his law degree, Robinson moved to Seattle and practiced in the firm of Bronson, Robinson & Jones. From 1924, he practiced with Harroun, Robinson, Maloy & Shidler, whose offices were at 1800 Exchange Building. Partners included George Levant Harroun, a graduate of Northwestern University, who focused on banking law. Other partners were C. E. H. Maloy, an active litigator, and Roger Shidler, a 1924 graduate of the University of Washington Law School. Harroun and Shidler stayed with the firm, which by 1960 had become Shidler, McBroom, Gates & Lucas. In 1916-1917, Robinson served on the Code Commission of the Washington State Bar Association. In 1920-1921, he was a member of the Judiciary and Judicial Administration Committee of the State Bar. From 1933 to 1936, he was the Chair of the State Board of Bar Examiners.

He was the uncle and cohort of the famous general and statesman Alcibiades (III), whom he accompanied in domestic and foreign affairs.Debra Nails, The People of Plato, Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 2002; pp. 63–64 This association led to his recurrence within ancient literature, including works attributed to Plato and Lysias. ==Life== The son of the famous Alcibiades' grandfather, brother of Cleinias and perhaps the nephew of Aspasia, Axiochus' lineage placed him within the elite and controversial Athenian family known as the Alcmaeonidae. Both the historical record and Lysias' apocryphal Funeral Oration speech imply Axiochus' close association with Alcibiades. Axiochus had a son, Cleinias (III). As reported by AndocidesAndocides, On the Mysteries, 16 and attested to within the archaeological record, Axiochus was indicted in 415 BCE along with Alcibiades in the profanation of the Eleusinian mysteries, a point of major domestic turmoil within the Peloponnesian War that preceded the calamitous Sicilian Expedition. This led Axiochus to flee Athens, causing him to lose his property and wealth in the process. Like Alcibiades, he seems to have returned to Athens sometime between 411 and 407. He participated in the defense of the generals from the Battle of Arginusae in 406, which marks his final attribution in the historical record. ==In literature== Several ancient authors included Axiochus in their work, and his character is represented as scandalous and excessive. In his eponymous dialogue, Aeschines of Sphettus lambastes Axiochus' carousal with Alcibiades; the speech attributed to Lysias (the contents of which are presumed by scholars to be fictional) describes a case of incestuous debauchery with his famous nephew through their co- marriages with both Medontis of Abydus and the daughter that resulted.Lysias, Funeral Oration, 46Steven D. Smith, Greek Identity and the Athenian Past in Chariton: The Romance of Empire, 2007. p. 226 The apocryphal Platonic dialogue that bears his name depicts his loss of self-confidence while grappling with mortality on his deathbed. Plato's Euthydemus presents prominently Axiochus' son Cleinias as a budding student of Socrates engaging dialectic against the sophists Euthydemus and Dionysodorus. ==See also== *List of speakers in Plato's dialogues ==References== Category:5th-century BC Athenians Category:Alcmaeonidae Category:Ancient Athenian generals Category:Ancient Greeks accused of sacrilege Category:Athenians of the Peloponnesian War ","title":"Axiochus (Alcmaeonid)"},{"id":"35945022","text":"Kenneth \\"Kenney\\" Walker (born December 23, 1988) is an American professional soccer player who plays for Louisville City on loan from fellow USL Championship club Indy Eleven. ==Early life== Kenney Walker was born on December 23, 1988 in Wickliffe, Ohio to Mark Walker and Dawn Hoban. He attended Wickliffe High School, where he played soccer for his senior year. That season, he scored seven goals and helped Wickliffe finish with an 18–4–1 record. He was recognized locally as the boys soccer player of the year by both The News-Herald and The Cleveland Plain Dealer. Walker matriculated to the University of Louisville in 2007. He played four seasons with the Cardinals men's soccer team from 2007 through 2011 (he redshirted the 2008 season due to an injury). In 2011, Walker was named to the All-Big East Conference Second Team. He graduated in 2011 with a degree in exercise science. Walker also played for USL Premier Development League team Chicago Fire Premier between 2010 and 2011. ==CareerLA Galaxy and loans=== Walker with LA Galaxy in 2015 LA Galaxy selected Walker in the second round (No. 38 overall) of the 2012 MLS SuperDraft. Galaxy coach Bruce Arena spoke positively of Walker, telling reporters, \\"He is a defensive midfielder, a holding midfielder, an aggressive type of player and a good passer of the ball.\\" Walker made his debut for Galaxy on May 26, 2012 against Houston Dynamo. He only played one half, however, and did not have another appearance for the rest of the season. In 2013, Walker logged no minutes with the Galaxy, and spent the latter half of the season on loan in the North American Soccer League (the second-division U.S. league at the time). On July 26, Walker was loaned to Florida-based Fort Lauderdale Strikers. He only had one appearance for them though, as he was loaned to Carolina RailHawks just a month later on August 22. He spent the remainder of the season in North Carolina, where he made 11 appearances. Walker began to see more action with Galaxy in 2014 and 2015, earning 7 starts and 16 appearances across the two years. He also spent significant time playing for LA Galaxy II, Galaxy's newly-formed reserve team in the United Soccer League. Walker debuted in Galaxy II's inaugural match against PDL side Fresno Fuego on February 13, 2014. Walker would go on to start in 14 of 16 appearances for Galaxy II over the following two years. ===FC Cincinnati=== Tampa Bay's Damion Lowe during a 2017 match in Cincinnati On December 7, 2015, Walker was announced as one of the first eleven signings for United Soccer League side FC Cincinnati, who played their first season in 2016. Walker quickly became one of the team's primary midfielders, starting in 27 of his 28 appearances during the club's inaugural season. He remained a key player in 2017 under the new leadership of head coach Alan Koch, starting in 26 of 27 appearances and leading the team with seven assists. On September 17, 2017, Walker was named USL Player of the Week after he notched two assists and his first goal of the season in a 4–2 win against New York Red Bulls II. Following the end of the season, FC Cincinnati announced Walker as their Most Valuable Player of 2017. Walker was one of just nine players who remained with FC Cincinnati into the 2018 season, as Koch spent the offseason significantly reworking the team roster. Walker started 2018 with a concussion injury, taking two weeks off after a heavy hit on March 31 from Indy Eleven's Jack McInerney (who was suspended for one game after a post-match review). On April 21, Walker made his return in a match against Pittsburgh Riverhounds as a 70th-minute substitute. He scored nine minutes after coming onto the pitch, earning a 2–2 draw for the club and a place on USL's Team of the Week for himself. The following week, Walker broke a 0–0 tie against Ottawa Fury with a goal shot from 50 yards out in the 68th minute (Cincinnati went on to win 0–3). The goal was featured as the #1 play in the SportsCenter Top 10 that night, and was later picked as the USL Fans' Choice Goal of the Month for April. ===Indy Eleven=== In late November 2018, ahead of FC Cincinnati's move up to Major League Soccer, Walker announced that he would be leaving the club to play for USL Championship side Indy Eleven. According to Walker, FC Cincinnati had told him and other players that they may have the chance to be signed to the MLS side, but only if the club did not get better players for the same positions in the December expansion draft. Walker declined to wait in favor of a guaranteed signing with Indy Eleven, explaining, \\"I think for me it came down to deciding if I wanted to play or be a guy (in Cincinnati) that's mentally supporting the team and helping out at training, doing all that stuff and not being a contributing piece on weekends.\\" On December 5, 2018, Indy Eleven officially announced their acquisition of Walker, along with his FC Cincinnati teammates Paddy Barrett and Tyler Gibson. On September 21, 2020, Walker was loaned to USL Championship side Louisville City for the remainder of the season.https://www.loucity.com/news_article/show/1123652 ==Honors== ;LA Galaxy * MLS Cup: 2014 ;FC Cincinnati * USL Player of the Week – Week 26, 2017 Season ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:American soccer players Category:Louisville Cardinals men's soccer players Category:Chicago Fire U-23 players Category:LA Galaxy players Category:Fort Lauderdale Strikers players Category:North Carolina FC players Category:LA Galaxy II players Category:Soccer players from Ohio Category:LA Galaxy draft picks Category:USL League Two players Category:Major League Soccer players Category:North American Soccer League players Category:USL Championship players Category:FC Cincinnati (2016–18) players Category:Association football midfielders Category:People from Wickliffe, Ohio Category:Indy Eleven players Category:Louisville City FC players ","title":"Kenney Walker"},{"id":"35945024","text":"The University of Medical Sciences, Cienfuegos (also Medicine School of Cienfuegos: Dr. Raúl Dorticós Torrado) was established in 1979 in Cienfuegos, Cuba.

The village, comprising just a few houses, lies between the road from Altenkirchen to Arkona and the bay of Tromper Wiek. As a result of its attractive location between Cape Arkona and the broad, over 10 km long beach of the Schaabe, the village is dominated by tourism (B&Bs; and holiday apartments). == Riesenberg barrow == Nobbin is best known for the megalithic tomb known as the Riesenberg (also Großsteingrab Riesenberg). The tomb was constructed of glacial erratic boulders and dates back to the New Stone Age in Rügen. It is one of the largest stone graves in North Germany and lies just a few metres from the steep coast on the bay of Tromper Wiek, immediately by the cliff top path (). The trapezoidal enclosure, which originally had 53 large boundary stones, is 34 metres long and 8 to 11 metres wide (39 stones have survived). In the north-east were two transverse dolmens, of which only one is well preserved. It is 1.4 metres high, 1.8 metres long and 1.1 metres wide. On the southwest side two guardian stones (Wächtersteine) in front of the enclosure rise to a height of over 3 metres, otherwise they are typical, especially of Scandinavian dolmens, but also similar in dimensions to the Dolmens of Dwasieden and those in Dummertevitz on Rügen. The presence of guardian stones is rare in Germany, but is explained by the proximity of the site to the Danish islands. During excavations in 1970 by Ewald Schuldt, Neolithic finds were made: three crosscutting (querschneidende) arrowheads, a sword, some broken vessels and a few bone fragments (including two skulls). In the northern grave chamber were the remains of an urn burial from the 5th century B.C. Between the guardian stones were shards of pottery from the Slavic era Rani tribe and an Arabic silver coin from the 9th century, amongst other things. This showed that the Riesenberg was a significant site for the island inhabitants for millennia. == See also == *Megaliths in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern == Literature == * Ingrid Schmidt: Hünengrab und Opferstein – Bodendenkmale auf der Insel Rügen. 1.

Her provocative costumes and dances caused an uproar in London and led to the imposition of restrictions on performances. ==Background== Parisot's given name has been cited as Rose and as Céline,Mlle Céline Parisot at racollection.org.uk, accessed 6 June 2012 but during her career she was commonly referred to simply as \\"Mademoiselle\\" or \\"Madame\\" Parisot. She debuted at the Théâtre de Monsieur in Paris at age 14 in a 20 December 1789 production of l'Infante de Zamora. Parisot was trained by Jean-Antoine Favre Guiardele, the ballet-master of the French Opera. The Victoria & Albert Museum identifies Parisot's father as the journalist Pierre-Germain Pariseau who was mistaken for a royalist and subsequently guillotined in 1794; however, in Louis Péricaud's chronicle of the Théâtre de Monsieur, Parisot's first name was Eugénie and her father was a sculptor. Her father allegedly told her: ==Dancing career in England== After the death of her father, Parisot moved to London where she made her stage debut at the King's Theatre on 9 February 1796 in a production of Piramo e Tisbe. The Morning Chronicle spoke of the 19-year-old's performance favorably and described her balance \\"as positively magical, for her person was almost horizontal while turning as a pivot on her toe.\\" Parisot frequently wore costumes that accentuated her legs as she danced, leading the Monthly Mirror to remark on her degree of flexibility in a 1796 performance in the ballet le Triomphe de l'Amour as creating \\"a stir by raising her legs far higher than was customary for dancers\\", while Leigh Hunt reported that she was \\"very thin and always smiling\\". Parisot's salary for the 1795–1796 season was £600 and she earned £577 in 1799–1800 and £840 during the 1803–1804 season. Bishop of Durham and the Duke of Queensberry are in the theatre box to the left. In the late 1790s, Parisot often danced with Rose and Charles Didelot, a husband and wife ballet pair that were trained in Paris and were later influential in developing Russian ballet. In 1798 The Hon. Shute Barrington, Bishop of Durham, denounced a dress she had worn while dancing at the Opera as \\"indecent\\".Farington, Joseph, ed. James Greig (1924) The Farington diary vol. 4, p. 62 (footnote) The risqué dance moves of Parisot and the Didelots and Parisot's use of sheer, neoclassical costumes that often exposed one breast led the same bishop to denounce the \\"immoral\\" antics of the French ballet dancers. The church's response attracted much ridicule and was parodied by many British caricaturists, including James Gilray, Isaac Cruikshank and Robert Newton, who produced multiple caricatures of the Bishop and the Duke of Queensberry looking under Parisot's skirt. In a 2 March 1798 address to the House of Lords, the Bishop declared that the French \\"female dancers, who, by the allurement of the most indecent attitudes and most wanton theatrical exhibitions succeeded but too effectually in loosening and corrupting the moral feelings of the people.\\" In response to the outcry, the colour of dancer's costumes was changed from light pink, flesh-toned pieces to a less provocative white and the performances were not to extend past midnight. In 1799, Parisot \\"astounded\\" British theatre goers when she dressed in menswear to play Lindor in a production of The Agreeable Surprise. A \\"shawl dance\\" performed by Parisot at the King's Theatre as part of the January 1805 production of the ballet, La belle Laitiere, ou Blanche, Reine de Castile \\"was received with enthusiastic applause.\\" On 15 June 1805, a riot occurred at the Opera due to the manager Mr. Kelly, following the Bishop of London's orders to end the ballet by midnight, drawing the curtain before a dance by Parisot was completed. The angry theatre patrons \\"threw all the chairs out of the boxes into the pit tore up the benches, destroyed the chandeliers, jumped into the orchestra, smashed the piano forte and broke all the instruments of the poor unoffending performers.\\" ==Retirement== Mademoiselle Parisot retired from the stage at the end of the 1807 season and married a Mr. Hughes, \\"an eminent florist-worker\\", who lived at Golden Square. An announcement in The Gentleman's Magazine for December 1807 read simply At the time of her retirement, she was still playing at the King's Theatre in the ballet La belle Laitiere, and it was reported in January 1808 that she had been replaced in this by a Miss Cranfield.The National Register dated January 17, 1808, p. 43 In March of that year Le Beau Monde reported Parisot's marriage to a Mr J. Hughes and claimed that \\"the lady is said to be three score years of age and to have retired from public life with three score thousand pounds\\".The Athenaeum, no. 4236 dated January 2, 1909, p. 22 The actual sum she accrued from her performances is estimated to be around £12,000. Parisot's colleague, Michael Kelly (1762–1826), published a memoir in 1826 in which he reported that Hughes was \\"a man of property\\".Kelly, Michael (1826) Reminiscences of Michael Kelly, of the King's theatre and Theatre royal, Drury Lane, including a period of nearly half a century, p. 339 An 1827 advertisement in the Morning Chronicle listed \\"Madame PARISSOT de PARIS\\" as a business selling French perfume and flowers at No. 324 Oxford St in London. Parisot was alive in 1837, living in Paris under her husband's name. ==Legacy== The 1796 Epsom Oaks winner, the Thoroughbred racehorse Parisot, was named after Mademoiselle Parisot. In January 1799, a coloured mezzotint by Charles Turner after John James Masquerier was published which showed Parisot dancing, lightly clothed with a garland (illustration above).After John James Masquerier 1778–1855 Mademoiselle Parisot, Stipple engraving, 213 X 171 mm at racollection.org.uk, accessed 6 June 2012 ==GalleryReferences== Category:18th-century French ballet dancers Category:1770s births Category:19th-century French ballet dancers Category:19th-century deaths Category:French ballerinas Category:Place of birth missing Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Year of death uncertain ","title":"Mademoiselle Parisot"},{"id":"35945097","text":"The Red Cliffs National Conservation Area is a National Conservation Area located in southwest Utah, north of St. George at the northeasternmost edge of the Mojave Desert.

ROCOS, also referred to as ROCOSes) is a group of about 80 astrophysical objects characterized by optical spectra anomalously devoid of emission or absorption features, which makes it impossible to determine their distances and locations in relation to our galaxy. They are considered to be a subclass of blazars, and are similar in their spectral characteristics to DC-dwarfs and single stellar-mass black holes. ==Discovery and study== The 6-meter optical telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Science used for studying ROCOSes Radio Objects with Continuous Optical Spectra, or ROCOSes, were discovered in the 1970s. Among the discoverers was a group of Soviet astrophysicists, who studied them at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory and the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Science, using the former's 2.6-meter optical telescope and the latter's 6-meter optical telescope (BTA-6), along with a 1000-channel photon counter and photometers. The group published their findings in a series of articles in the Russian scientific journals Astronomy Letters and Astronomy Reports. ==Criteria== An astronomical radio object is classified as a ROCOS if it possesses (a) an optical image with stellar appearance, which is identified with a radio source, and (b) no emission or absorption features in its optical spectrum, except for those due to galactic interstellar medium, with a signal-to-noise ratio at the level of those observable for quasar candidates. About 8% of the known astronomical radio objects satisfy these two criteria and are considered ROCOSes. ==Properties== The absence of distinct emission or absorption lines in the ROCOSes' spectra makes them very similar in this regard to highly polarized quasars (HPQ), BL Lac objects, and single stellar-mass black holes. The absence of optical spectral features also makes it impossible to use red shift for determining their distances or even ascertaining if they are located within or outside our galaxy. ==References== Category:Astrophysics Category:Astronomical radio sources Category:Radio astronomy ","title":"Radio object with continuous optical spectrum"},{"id":"35945203","text":"The Battle of Mbumbi was a military engagement between forces of Portuguese Angola and the Kingdom of Kongo. ==Pre-battle situation== Portuguese Angola was established in 1575 as a reward to the Portuguese for helping the Kingdom of Kongo defeat the Jagas whom invaded the realm in 1568. After a disastrous attempt at conquering the Kingdom of Ndongo, the Portuguese governor Mendes de Vasconcellos made an alliance with the Imbangala, a people described by European and Kongo sources as rootless, cannibal mercenaries originating south of the Kwanza River. The governor used them to destroy the Ndongo while Portuguese Angola reaped the slaves that emerged from the chaos. In 1621, Vasconcellos was succeeded by João Correia de Sousa. Correia de Sousa hoped to reap the same benefits as his predecessor by unleashing the Imbangala into Kongo territory. He first targeted the forest land of Kazanze, a Kongo vassal that had been a haven for runaway slaves from Portuguese Angola. Correia de Sousa then ordered Captain Major Pedro de Sousa Coelho and 20,000 Mbundu and Portuguese with an Imbangala contingent into Nambu a Ngongo inside the Kongo province of Mbamba. The area fell but not before its lord could flee to the commercial town of Bumbi. ==Preparation == Captain-Major Sousa Coelho marched on Bumbi with 30,000 men, most of which were Mbundu archers supplemented by Portuguese heavy infantry and the all-important Imbangala mercenaries. Inside the town, the Duke of Mbamba Paulo Afonso and the Marquis of Pemba Cosme led the Kongo forces. They had gathered about 3,000 men as light infantry (bowmen) augmented by 200 nobles fighting as traditional heavy infantry (sword and shield). Before giving battle, the Duke of Mbamba made Confession and received the Holy Sacraments before arming himself with sword, shield and relics of various saints. ==The battle== At the start of the battle, both sides gave the battle cry \\"Santiago\\" before engaging. The Kongo forces, seeing this coincidence, remarked that if the Portuguese saint was white, theirs was black. The Duke's forces initiated the battle routing the Mbundu archers whose ranks had swollen to some 30,000 by the time of the battle. But just as in Ndongo, the Imbangala mercenaries would not yield and destroyed the Kongo force with a counterattack. The duke, marquis, 90 lesser nobles and thousands of common soldiers were all slain. According to Jesuit accounts of the battle, the Portuguese succeeded in taking many slaves from the battle and sacked the whole settlement, not sparing the possessions of the Portuguese established there. The Imbangala, as was their custom, cannibalized many of their prisoners including the bodies of the Duke of Mbamba and the Marquis of Pemba. ==Aftermath== The battle of Mbumbi sent shockwaves through the entire Kingdom of Kongo. Anti-Portuguese riots broke out all over Kongo, resulting in widespread bloodletting. The newly crowned King Pedro II was forced to put those Portuguese that could be saved under his protection at his camp at Mbanda Kasi where he was gathering his forces for a counterattack. The Portuguese victory at Mbumbi put a final nail in the coffin of Kongo- Portuguese friendship. Kongo declared war on Portuguese Angola and fought them out of Kongo and even taking territories that had been under the rule of Portuguese Angola. A final consequence of the battle was King Pedro II's letter campaign to the Dutch proposing an alliance that would culminate twenty years later in an invasion of Angola. ==See also== *Kongo-Portuguese War of 1622 *Kingdom of Kongo *History of Angola ==References== Mbumbi Mbumbi Category:1622 in Africa Mbumbi Category:Portuguese Angola ","title":"Battle of Mbumbi"},{"id":"35945205","text":"Konstantinos Moragiemos (; born 18 November 1936) is a Greek former sprinter who competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:Greek male sprinters Category:Olympic athletes of Greece Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1960 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Athens Category:Competitors at the 1959 Mediterranean Games Category:Mediterranean Games gold medalists for Greece Category:Mediterranean Games medalists in athletics ","title":"Konstantinos Moragiemos"},{"id":"35945214","text":"Leonidas Kormalis (born 6 November 1932) is a Greek former sprinter who competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

In Otuzco existed a chapel dedicated to Immaculate Conception, Patroness of Otuzco in that time. When the news became known that the northern cities Guayaquil and Zaña had been attacked by pirates and believing that Trujillo would be the next city to be attacked, from Trujillo were sent messages to the nearby villages so they could take their preventive measures.

Miraculously Trujillo was not attacked by pirates dangerous, and since then born worship and faith to Virgin of La Puerta which spans the north of Peru. ==Patronal feast== The celebration originated in 1664 when it placed the image of the Virgin at the entrance of Otuzco as precaution of the risk of a pirate raid.

It provides a prayer to the goddess Ninsun and gives his position as “expert accountant.” His other cylinder seal,Cylinder seal BM 122696. lists four generations of his ancestors of which Arad-Ea “scholar of accounting” (Sumerian: ummia niğkas) is the first. His father, Uššur-ana- Marduk, had been gá-dub-ba é-[kur?], governor of Nippur, his grandfather, Usi- ana-nuri-?, GIR3.NITA2 kurdilmunki-a, “regent” or “viceroy” of Dilmun, ancient Bahrain. His brother was Ile’’e-bulṭa-Marduk, a temple administrator of the Marduk temple in Babylon, as recorded on a copy of a recipe for glass,Tablet BM 120960. the original apparently dated to the “Year after that in which Gulkišar became king,” presumed to either refer to the original recipe, or perhaps a fanciful archaism for the tablet. There seems to have been a rift in the family, with his cousin, Marduk-nādin-aḫḫē, moving to Aššur to take up an appointment as royal scribe to the Assyrian king, Aššūr-uballiṭ (ca. 1353 BC – 1318 BC), as a copy of his obsequious memorial inscriptionMemorial tablet, BM 96947, 30’ff. recalls “[some]one can set [stra]ight [the kinsmen] and clans of my ancestors that have embraced [tre]achery.” Wiggerman suggests that the cause of the division may have been the divided loyalties surrounding the overthrow of Kara-ḫardaš, the son and successor of Burna-Buriaš II, who had been Aššūr-uballiṭ’s grandson or son-in-law. This would have placed Marduk- nādin-aḫḫē’s branch of the family firmly on the side of the Assyrian military intervention, while that of Uballissu-Marduk’s perhaps sided with the usurper Nazi-Bugaš and certainly with Kurigalzu II, an Assyrian-appointee who eventually came to conflict with his erstwhile benefactors, probably riding a wave of public sentiment against their northern neighbors. Uballissu-Marduk’s descendants were recorded in the genealogy of Marduk-zâkir-šumi, the bēl pīḫati, “person responsible” or provincial governor, who was the beneficiary of a royal gift of corn-land on a kudurruKudurru 90850, BBSt V. in the time of Marduk-apla-iddina I, ca. 1171–1159 BC.

In the battle Swedish forces defeated an allied army composed mainly of Danes supported by a smaller contingent of Brandenburg and Hesse-Cassel troops. The Swedes were able to muster some 3,500 men for the battle, including 2,000 cavalry.Historiska upplysningar om Svenska och Norska arméernas regementer och kårer, Harold Oscar Prytz. p.174 The allied Danish and Brandenburg troops amounted to about 4,670 men, including a few hundred Brandenburg and Hesse- Cassel soldiers and 1,770 cavalry, as well as 16 cannon. 170 Swedes lost their lives in the battle and subsequent pursuit. The Danish/Brandenburg side lost 400 killed and more than 3,600 captured. After the battle and in the days that followed, the entire allied force were captured or forced to follow the Swedish flag. == Background == In 1675, the Kingdom of Sweden, which, at that time, was recognized as a major military power, declared war against Brandenburg-Prussia, following pressure by the French king, Louis XIV, because Brandenburg-Prussia was at war with France (in the Dutch War). After a Swedish army had been defeated in the Battle of Fehrbellin in 1675 in Brandenburg, Sweden went onto the defensive in the next phase of the war. Suddenly its possessions in northern Germany (Swedish Pomerania) were threatened by the alliance of Denmark and Brandenburg-Prussia. In 1677 the Swedish fleet was almost completely destroyed in the Battle of Køge Bay by the Danish fleet under command of Admiral Niels Juel. For Swedish Rügen this defeat meant that the island possession was now cut off from all assistance from Sweden, as the Danes exercised naval supremacy of the Baltic Sea. After winning the battle the King of Denmark, Christian V, decided to capture the island of Rügen as a necessary prerequisite to the allies conquering the fort of Stralsund on the opposite mainland shore. According to internal agreements between Brandenburg- Prussia and Denmark, the island of Rügen would be given to Denmark after the peace treaty with Sweden. On 17 September 1677 Danish troops under the overall command of the Danish king landed on the eastern coast of the island near Prorer Wiek. The roughly 4,200 manCurt Jany: Geschichte der Preußischen Armee. Vom 15. Jahrhundert bis 1914. Vol. 1, Biblio Verlag, Osnabrück 1967, p. 257 strong Danish force met no resistance, however, because the Swedish general, Otto Wilhelm von Königsmarck, had not suspected a Danish invasion at that time and most of his troops had therefore moved into the besieged town of Stralsund. Thus, the Danes were able to entrench themselves, unchallenged, in the wooded hills in front of the village. After the Danes had provided further support to the Brandenburg cavalry regiment of Colonel Hülsen (2,110 troopers) in October, they advanced on the Swedish troops that had meanwhile transferred to Rügen, and had taken up positions near Bergen. The Swedes were beaten in the ensuing Battle of Bergen and withdrew to Altefähr and into the Prosnitzer Schanze. Shortly thereafter the Swedes under Königsmarck also had to leave Altefähr and march all troops to Stralsund. Only the Prosnitzer Schanze (Neue Fährschanze) remained in Swedish hands. Due to ongoing looting and devastation by Swedish, Danish and Brandenburg troops, the island in the meantime been completely plundered, so that the deployed troops there could no longer be supplied. On 21 October the Danish king returned to Denmark. Part of the Brandenburg troops were withdrawn from the island, leaving only 970 men from Brandenburg-Prussia on the island. The Danish-Brandenburg troops were now under the command of Major General von Rumohr and Colonel Wilhelm Friedrich von Hülsen. These two had instructions not to engage with the Swedes until the arrival of further reinforcements. However, any reinforcement from the Danish army, weakened by disease, came to nothing. So the Swedish commander, Field Marshal Otto Wilhelm von Konigsmark, viewed that it was a good time to recapture the island and transferred his 3,500 strong force in January 1678 from Brandshagen to the island. The Swedish chose to land at Neufährschanze which was still in Swedish hands. == Course of the battle == Maj Gen Königsmarck, the Swedish commander Against orders, the allied Danish and Brandenburg force under Major General von Rumohr gave battle. At 9 in the morning the battle began with an exchange of artillery on the road between Poseritz and Gustow at Warksow Manor. When Detlef von Rumohr was felled by an artillery shell, confusion arose in the ranks of the allies. In response, the Swedish general, Konigsmark attacked with his troops. The attack was launched by the Swedish right wing against the Brandenburg cavalry. They managed to disperse the Swedish cavalry, but were in turn thrown back, once the Swedish cavalry had reorganised and been reinforced by reserves. The Brandenburg troops rallied again, but received no effective support from the Danes, with the result that they were thrown back by superior numbers again. Swedish forces then attacked the Danish flank and rear. Demoralized, they were routed and put to flight in all directions. The Swedes succeeded in capturing almost the entire Danish infantry.Runeberg Page 636 After four hours of battle, the Swedish victory was assured. == Result of the battle == Renewed invasion by the allies on 23 September 1678, 8 months after the battle The next day, the Swedes occupied Bergen, pursued their fleeing enemy towards Jasmund and Wittow and captured there the last remnants of the allies. The captured soldiers were integrated into the Swedish army and used on Rügen. So Rügen became Swedish again for a short while. However, the Danish and Brandenburg allies quickly recovered from this setback. In the course of the summer 1678 the Danes raided Rügen several times. In addition, the Danes and Brandenburgians were planning a new expedition to recapture Rügen. The invasion of Rügen began on 23 September 1678, when Brandenburg troops again landed on the island of Rügen; within two days they had recaptured it. The prisoners pressed into Swedish service from the Battle of Warksow handed over the fort of Neuefähr without a fight to Brandenburg's invasion forces. == See also == * Wars and battles involving Prussia == References  Literature == * Curt Jany: Geschichte der Preußischen Armee.

Power was provided by a Mathis G8 engine which drove a Turbomeca compressor. The low-pressure air output from the compressor was ducted to each of the three rotor blades to the ends of each blade. At the tip of each blade was a combustion chamber where the air was mixed with fuel and ignited. The Ariel had a short tail boom with twin vertical tail surfaces. On 23 March 1949. an improved S.O.1110 Ariel II was flown, it was a similar configuration to the Ariel I was had revised tail surfaces.Apostolo 1984, p. 94. The final variant was the S.O.1120 Ariel III which had a combined Turbomeca Arrius turbine-compressor rather than the two units of the earlier aircraft. With the space made from the power changes an extra seat was fitted. Another difference was the tail unit, the Ariel II had a single fin and rudder and used jet efflux from the turbine to provide directional control, a directional vane linked to the rudder directed the efflux. ==Operational history== The Ariel was not put into production but the knowledge gained was used in the development of the Sud-Ouest Djinn.Orbis 1985, p. 2975. thumb ==Variants== ;S.O.1100 Ariel I :Two-seat experimental tip-jet helicopter with a piston engine-powered compressor. ;S.O.1110 Ariel II :Improved variant with revised tail surfaces. ;S.O.1120 Ariel III :Improved three-seat variant with a combined turbine-compressor. ==Specifications (Ariel II)See alsoReferencesNotes=Bibliography=== * Apostolo, Giorgio.

During the offseason, the Kings signed free agent Keon Clark and later on in December signed Jim Jackson. Throughout the season, none of the Kings' players played a full season via suspension or injury, but they still managed to post a 59–23 record, two games less than their previous output in which they went 61–21, thus repeating as Pacific Division Champions once again. Bobby Jackson was named Sixth Man of The Year. After easily dispatching the Utah Jazz in five games in the first round, the team started to look like a title contender, but in Game 2 against the Dallas Mavericks in the second round, their title hopes took a serious blow when star forward Chris Webber suffered a knee injury while trying to catch a lob pass from teammate Mike Bibby, ending his season. Webber's knee required microfracture surgery in the following off-season. Without their team captain and MVP, the Kings lost the series in seven games. Following the season, Hedo Türkoğlu was traded to the San Antonio Spurs, Scot Pollard was traded to the Indiana Pacers, Clark was dealt to the Utah Jazz, and Jackson signed as a free agent with the Houston Rockets. Webber and Peja Stojaković were both voted to play in the 2003 NBA All-Star Game in Atlanta. However, this time, Stojakovic was the only team representative as Webber was forced to withdraw due to a sprained ankle in a home loss against the Utah Jazz. Head coach Rick Adelman was selected to coach the Western Conference All-Stars. For the season, the team sported new uniforms which would remain until 2008. ==OffseasonDraft picks=== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 393997; color:#c5ced4\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 393997; color:#c5ced4\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 393997; color:#c5ced4\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 393997; color:#c5ced4\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 393997; color:#c5ced4\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 393997; color:#c5ced4\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  28  Dan Dickau  PG   Gonzaga - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  2  57  Corsley Edwards    Central Connecticut State } ==RosterNote=== Bold = All-Star selection ===Roster Notes=== *Guard Brent Price missed the entire season due to a back injury. ==Regular seasonSeason standings=== :z – clinched division title :y – clinched division title :x – clinched playoff spot ===Record vs. opponents=== {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=302002-03 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000000;color:#5787DC;width=35\\"CLE !0055BA;color:#898D8F;width=35\\"DAL !141A44;color:#BC2224;width=35\\"DEN !006BB7;color:#ED164B;width=35\\"DET !072E63;color:#DC5A34;width=35\\"GSW !002366;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#0CB2AC;width=35\\"MEM !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !00471B;color:#5C378A;width=35\\"MIL !044D80;color:#000000;width=35\\"MIN !12305B;color:#C4CED4;width=35\\"NJN !0093B1;color:#FDB827;width=35\\"NOH !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !000000;color:#BB9754;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !6846A8;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#FFC322;width=35\\"SEA !7436BF;color:#BE0F34;width=35\\"TOR !644A9C;color:#149BC7;width=35\\"UTA !044D7D;color:#BC7A44;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  0–3  2–2  4–0  0–2  2–0  1–3  0–2  1–1  2–2  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–3  2–2  0–2  1–3  2–2  1–3  2–1  3–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–3  1–1  2–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  3–0  —  2–2  4–0  0–2  1–1  2–2  1–1  0–2  2–2  2–0  1–1  2–0  2–2  1–2  2–0  1–3  3–1  4–0  3–2  2–2  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–2  2–0  1–2  1–1  1–3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Chicago  2–2  2–2  —  3–1  0–2  1–1  0–4  1–1  1–1  2–2  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–2  2–2  0–2  2–2  1–3  2–1  1–3  1–3  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–2  2–2  1–1  1–3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cleveland  0–4  0–4  1–3  —  0–2  1–1  0–4  1–1  1–1  0–4  2–0  1–1  0–2  1–2  0–4  0–2  2–2  1–3  1–2  0–4  0–4  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  1–1  3–1  1–1  0–4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Dallas  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  —  4–0  2–0  4–0  4–0  1–1  4–0  1–3  4–0  2–0  0–2  2–2  2–0  2–0  2–0  1–1  2–0  2–2  2–2  1–3  2–2  2–2  2–0  2–2  2–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Denver  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  0–4  —  0–2  0–4  0–4  1–1  1–3  0–4  2–2  2–0  1–1  0–4  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  1–3  2–2  0–4  1–3  1–3  1–1  0–4  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Detroit  3–1  2–2  4–0  4–0  0–2  2–0  —  1–1  2–0  2–2  1–1  1–1  2–0  3–1  1–3  1–1  2–1  2–2  2–2  2–1  2–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  3–1  2–0  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Golden State  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  0–4  4–0  1–1  —  1–3  1–1  2–2  2–2  2–2  1–1  0–2  1–3  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  2–0  2–2  0–4  0–4  1–3  2–2  2–0  2–2  2–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Houston  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  0–4  4–0  0–2  3–1  —  1–1  2–2  2–2  3–1  1–1  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  2–0  2–0  3–1  1–3  2–2  1–3  2–2  2–0  1–3  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Indiana  2–2  2–2  2–2  4–0  1–1  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  —  2–0  0–2  1–1  4–0  3–1  2–0  1–2  3–1  3–1  2–1  2–2  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–2  2–0  3–1  1–1  2–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  L.A.

The song gained strong popularity following the 2011 Norway attacks, which led to it being described by the media as \\"the new national anthem.\\"Verdig tilstandsrapport fra nasjonalartistene, BT.no According to the NRK, the song \\"came to symbolize the sorrow many people went through.\\" The song featured most prominently in all the memorial ceremonies following the attacks. The NRK memorial concert (30 July 2011) following the attacks was named \\"Mitt lille land,\\" and the concert opened with \\"Mitt lille land\\" sung by Maria Mena. The national memorial ceremony (21 August 2011) was opened with \\"Mitt lille land\\" sung by Susanne Sundfør, followed by a speech by King Harald V. On the Norwegian Constitution Day in 2012, the NRK broadcast was opened with \\"Mitt lille land.\\" The Norwegian People's Aid and Sony Music released a memorial album titled Mitt lille land and Gyldendal Norsk Forlag published a memorial book also titled Mitt lille land during the autumn of 2011. Numerous Norwegian artists have recorded cover versions of this song, among them Sondre Bratland, Christine Guldbrandsen, Maria Solheim, Thomas Dybdahl, Mari Boine, Anne Grete Preus, Haddy N'jie, Kurt Nilsen, D.D.E., Sølvguttene, Tone Damli Aaberge and Maria Mena. The song was originally written for the pro-EU organisation \\"Fra Nei til Ja\\" (From No to Yes) in connection with the 1994 Norwegian European Union membership referendum, and the song has been described as ironic. Ole Paus denied in 2011 that the song was ironic. According to Professor of Musicology Even Ruud, \\"the music and the text are very open. There is nothing in the song that is related to a particular time, which means that it can be interpreted in several different ways.\\" The song was originally released on the album also titled Mitt lille land in 1994, which contained four tracks. The first track was Mitt lille land and the last track was a rap performed by Ole Paus and Labour politician and then-Minister of Trade and Shipping Affairs Grete Knudsen titled Sjølråderetten fallera!. ==References== Category:Norwegian songs Category:2011 Norway attacks Category:1994 songs ","title":"Mitt lille land"},{"id":"35945622","text":"The 2003–04 NBA season was the Kings' 55th season in the National Basketball Association, and their 19th season in Sacramento.2003-04 Sacramento Kings The season was best remembered for the team making a move in the offseason, acquiring Brad Miller from the Indiana Pacers and signing free agent Anthony Peeler. Superstar forward Chris Webber, who spent most of the season recovering from microfracture knee surgery, then serving a suspension due to the Ed Martin scandal, returned for the final 23 games of the season in which they played mediocre basketball the rest of the way. Still, the Kings finished the season second in the Pacific Division with a 55–27 record. Miller and Peja Stojaković were both selected for the 2004 NBA All-Star Game. In the first round of the playoffs, the Kings got the last laugh as they defeated their archrivals the Dallas Mavericks in five games, before falling to Kevin Garnett and the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round as Webber missed a potential game-tying 3-pointer in Game 7. This ended the Kings' attempt at a championship as their core would be dismantled the following season, which included Vlade Divac re-signing as a free agent with the Los Angeles Lakers, Peeler signing with the Washington Wizards, and Gerald Wallace leaving in the 2004 NBA Expansion Draft. ==OffseasonDraft picks=== The Kings had no draft picks in 2003. ==RosterRegular seasonSeason standings=== :z – clinched division title :y – clinched division title :x – clinched playoff spot ===Record vs. opponents=== {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=302003-04 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !9F1F32;color:#001D43;width=35\\"CLE !0055BA;color:#898D8F;width=35\\"DAL !4C92CC;color:#FDB827;width=35\\"DEN !006BB7;color:#ED164B;width=35\\"DET !072E63;color:#DC5A34;width=35\\"GSW !D31145;color:#CBD4D8;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#0CB2AC;width=35\\"MEM !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !00471B;color:#5C378A;width=35\\"MIL !044D80;color:#000000;width=35\\"MIN !12305B;color:#C4CED4;width=35\\"NJN !0093B1;color:#FDB827;width=35\\"NOH !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !000000;color:#BB9754;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !6846A8;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#FFC322;width=35\\"SEA !7436BF;color:#BE0F34;width=35\\"TOR !644A9C;color:#149BC7;width=35\\"UTA !044D7D;color:#BC7A44;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  3–1  3–1  1–3  2–0  2–0  1–3  0–2  0–2  0–4  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–3  2–2  1–1  1–3  2–2  0–3  1–3  1–2  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–3  0–2  2–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  1–3  —  1–2  3–1  1–1  2–0  0–3  2–0  1–1  1–3  0–2  0–2  1–1  2–2  1–3  1–1  2–2  0–4  1–3  3–1  3–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  3–1  1–1  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Chicago  1–3  2–1  —  2–2  0–2  0–2  0–4  1–1  0–2  1–3  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–4  1–3  0–2  0–3  2–2  2–2  3–1  0–4  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  4–0  1–1  1–3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cleveland  3–1  1–3  2–2  —  0–2  0–2  2–2  0–2  0–2  1–3  1–1  0–2  0–2  2–2  2–2  0–2  1–2  3–1  4–0  2–1  3–1  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  2–0  1–3  1–1  2–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Dallas  0–2  1–1  2–0  2–0  —  2–2  1–1  3–1  3–1  0–2  2–2  2–2  2–2  1–1  1–1  2–2  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  1–1  3–1  3–1  3–1  3–1  3–1  1–1  2–2  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Denver  0–2  0–2  2–0  2–0  2–2  —  0–2  3–1  2–2  0–2  2–2  1–3  2–2  1–1  2–0  1–3  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  2–0  4–0  4–0  2–2  1–3  2–2  0–2  3–1  2–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Detroit  3–1  3–0  4–0  2–2  1–1  2–0  —  1–1  1–1  1–3  2–0  1–1  2–0  4–0  3–1  0–2  2–2  1–3  3–1  3–1  2–2  2–0  2–0  0–2  1–1  1–1  3–1  1–1  3–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Golden State  2–0  0–2  1–1  2–0  1–3  1–3  1–1  —  2–2  0–2  2–2  1–3  1–3  1–1  1–1  2–2  0–2  0–2  2–0  1–1  1–1  2–2  2–2  2–2  2–2  3–1  1–1  2–2  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Houston  2–0  1–1  2–0  2–0  1–3  2–2  1–1  2–2  —  1–1  4–0  2–2  1–3  1–1  2–0  2–2  1–1  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  1–3  3–1  0–4  0–4  1–3  1–1  2–2  2–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Indiana  4–0  3–1  3–1  3–1  2–0  2–0  3–1  2–0  1–1  —  2–0  1–1  1–1  3–0  1–3  1–1  3–1  2–2  3–1  3–1  4–0  2–0  1–1  0–2  1–1  2–0  4–0  2–0  2–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  L.A.

Bonine (October 21, 1863 – August 22, 1941) was an American sprinter and eye doctor. He held the world's record in the 110-yard dash for 35 years from 1886 until 1921. He later became an internationally known eye doctor who saw over one million patients at his office in Niles, Michigan. ==Early years and athlete== Bonine was born in Niles, Michigan in 1863. His father, Evan J. Bonine, was a physician with a practice in Niles. Evan J. Had been a civil war surgeon, a diary in the Niles museum recounts his travel south by stagecoach and his history of performing many amputations. Fred N. Bonine attended the Niles public schools, he then enrolled at the University of Michigan where he received his MD degree. He received advanced training in ear eye nose surgery in Frieberg, Germany. At Michigan he was a member of the football and track teams. In 1886, Bonine set a world's record with a time of 10.8 seconds in the 110-yard dash. The record stood for 35 years until it was broken in 1921 by Charley Paddock. That same year, Bonine was the captain of the Michigan track team that became the first athletic team from the west to compete in New York. ==Medical practice== Bonine at 1885 Intercollegiate Championships. Bonine later became a nationally known eye doctor. Each year, tens of thousands of patients from around the world reportedly sought treatment at Bonine's office above a corner drug store in Niles, Michigan. Bonine regularly treated as many as 517 patients in one day and regularly saw 200 patients in a day. Hundreds lined up each day, none with appointments, to see him, with each being charged the same fee of two dollars for a first visit and one dollar for subsequent visits. Special buses from Chicago ato Niles ran twice a week to bring patients to see Bonine. Several restaurants, gift shops, and hotels in Niles reportedly \\"owed their existence to the patronage drawn to this small city by his fame.\\" One newspaper wrote: > \\"So numerous were the patients who filled his office each day, that brutally > long hours were required to care for them. He never spared himself, > frequently remaining until 10 o'clock or even midnight to finish. An > indefatigable worker, he had the assistance of only a small office force. > One of his main therapies was a treatment nonsurgically for dissolving > cataracts with a proprietary solution. It was said of him that he rivalled > Napoleon Bonaparte and Thomas A. Edison for going without sleep. . . . A > time-worn, old-fashioned suite of office in Niles was a crossroads for that > vast army of unfortunates with afflicted eyesight who came from the four > corners of the earth seeking the professional assistance of Dr. Fred N. > Bonine.\\" He was reported to have seen 1,500,000 patients in nearly 50 years of practice. ==Sports medicine and boxing commissioner== In 1912, he served as a medical advisor to the United States team at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden. Bonine was also a member of the Michigan State Athletic Board of Control and the Michigan Boxing Commission. He became a close friend of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Dempsey after reportedly saving Dempsey's eyesight at the height of the boxer's career. In 1925, at Bonine's office in Niles, Michigan, Dempsey and African-American champion Harry Wills signed papers agreeing to fight for the heavyweight championship of the world. (The fight never took place.) ==Community service and later years== Bonine also served nine years as the mayor of Niles, Michigan. He was married to Viva Thomas and a member of the Trinity Episcopal Church in Niles. He was a 33rd degree Mason and was honored at a Masonic dinner in November 1934 on the occasion of his 50th year in the Masons. Bonine became ill with pneumonia in the spring of 1938. He suffered a stroke in June 1938 from which he recovered in part, but he was unable to return to his medical practice. Bonine died at his home in Niles in August 1941 at age 77. Stores and factories in Niles closed for Bonine's funeral, which was held at the Trinity Episcopal Church. ==References== Category:1863 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Michigan Wolverines football players Category:Michigan Wolverines men's track and field athletes Category:People from Niles, Michigan Category:Mayors of places in Michigan Category:American optometrists Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Fred Bonine"},{"id":"35945639","text":"The 2004–05 NBA season was the Kings' 56th season in the National Basketball Association, and their 20th season in Sacramento.2004-05 Sacramento Kings The Kings struggled losing four of their first five games, but would then win 12 of their next 13 games. However, as the season progressed, the Kings would trade away their top players. Doug Christie was traded to the Orlando Magic for Cuttino Mobley in January, and All-Star forward Chris Webber was dealt to the Philadelphia 76ers for Kenny Thomas and former Kings' forward Corliss Williamson in February. Still, the Kings managed to finish second in the Pacific Division with a solid 50–32 record, clinching a sixth spot in the Western Conference. However, in the playoffs, the Kings failed to make it out of the first round, losing to the Seattle SuperSonics in five games. Following the season, Mobley signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Clippers, and Bobby Jackson was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies. ==OffseasonDraft picks=== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 393997; color:#c5ced4\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 393997; color:#c5ced4\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 393997; color:#c5ced4\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 393997; color:#c5ced4\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 393997; color:#c5ced4\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 393997; color:#c5ced4\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  26  Kevin Martin  SG   Western Carolina - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  48  Ricky Minard  SG   Morehead State } ==RosterRegular seasonSeason standings=== :z – clinched division title :y – clinched division title :x – clinched playoff spot ===Record vs. opponents=== {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text- align:center;\\" - !colspan=312004-05 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !253E6A;color:#DF5106;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !9F1F32;color:#001D43;width=35\\"CLE !0055BA;color:#898D8F;width=35\\"DAL !4C92CC;color:#FDB827;width=35\\"DEN !006BB7;color:#ED164B;width=35\\"DET !072E63;color:#DC5A34;width=35\\"GSW !D31145;color:#CBD4D8;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !00265B;color:#BAD1EB;width=35\\"MEM !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !00471B;color:#5C378A;width=35\\"MIL !044D80;color:#000000;width=35\\"MIN !12305B;color:#C4CED4;width=35\\"NJN !0093B1;color:#FDB827;width=35\\"NOH !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !000000;color:#BB9754;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !6846A8;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#FFC322;width=35\\"SEA !7436BF;color:#BE0F34;width=35\\"TOR !042A5C;color:#4C8ECC;width=35\\"UTA !044D7D;color:#BC7A44;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  1–3  1–3  0–4  0–4  1–1  0–2  1–3  0–2  1–1  0–3  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–4  1–2  1–1  0–3  1–1  1–3  1–3  1–3  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  1–2  0–2  0–4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  3–1  —  4–0  2–2  1–2  0–2  0–2  1–3  1–1  1–1  1–2  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–2  3–1  1–1  1–3  2–0  3–1  3–0  1–3  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  2–0  3–1  2–0  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Charlotte  3–1  0–4  —  0–4  0–4  0–2  1–1  2–1  0–2  2–0  0–3  0–2  0–2  0–2  1–3  0–4  1–1  0–4  1–1  1–3  3–1  0–3  0–2  0–2  1–1  0–2  0–2  1–2  1–1  0–4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Chicago  4–0  2–2  4–0  —  2–2  1–1  1–1  2–2  1–1  0–2  2–2  0–2  1–1  2–0  1–3  2–2  2–0  0–4  1–1  4–0  3–0  2–1  0–2  2–0  1–1  0–2  1–1  3–0  2–0  1–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cleveland  4–0  2–1  4–0  2–2  —  1–1  1–1  2–2  2–0  0–2  1–3  1–1  1–1  2–0  0–3  2–2  1–1  1–3  2–0  1–3  3–1  0–3  1–1  2–0  0–2  0–2  0–2  3–1  2–0  1–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Dallas  1–1  2–0  2–0  1–1  1–1  —  2–1  1–1  3–1  2–2  1–1  1–2  2–2  4–0  2–0  2–0  2–2  2–0  4–0  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–2  4–0  3–1  1–3  3–1  2–0  3–0  2–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Denver  2–0  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–2  —  1–1  2–2  1–2  2–0  2–1  2–2  4–0  1–1  2–0  2–2  1–1  4–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  0–4  3–1  1–2  2–2  2–2  2–0  2–2  2–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Detroit  3–1  3–1  1–2  2–2  2–2  1–1  1–1  —  2–0  2–0  2–2  2–0  2–0  0–2  2–1  2–2  1–1  2–1  2–0  3–0  3–1  3–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  3–1  1–1  4–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Golden State  2–0  1–1  2–0  1–1  0–2  1–3  2–2  0–2  —  1–2  1–1  0–4  1–3  1–3  0–2  2–0  1–2  0–2  2–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  2–2  2–2  3–1  0–3  2–2  1–1  2–1  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Houston  1–1  1–1  0–2  2–0  2–0  2–2  2–1  0–2  2–1  —  1–1  3–0  2–2  3–1  1–1  1–1  1–2  2–0  3–1  1–1  2–0  2–0  2–2  4–0  2–2  2–2  3–1  1–1  2–2  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Indiana  3–0  2–1  3–0  2–2  3–1  1–1  0–2  2–2  1–1  1–1  —  0–2  1–1  2–0  3–1  2–2  2–0  2–2  1–1  2–2  1–3  0–4  1–1  2–0  0–2  1–1  0–2  2–1  2–0  2–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  L.A.

Hill-dwellers are spread through the south and southwest of these mountains, including many on the Cameroun side. There are 21 Koma villages in the Cameroonian side of the Alantika Mountains and 17 villages on the Nigerian side. The largest towns in the Koma area are: Tantille, Chonha, Mani, Nassaraw Koma and Ba-Usmanu. ==History== The Koma people became recognized as Nigerians in 1961, a year after independence, along with the old provinces of Cameroun. Today Koma is part of the seven districts of Jada local government in Adamawa State. The hill was discovered in 1986 by a corps member. ==Description== The Koma have their own language, known as Koma, with an estimated 61,000 speakers. It is a member of the Niger–Congo family. The Koma people are divided into three main groups: the hill-dwelling Beya and Ndamti, and the Vomni and Verre lowlanders. They are committed to their traditional culture. The men wear loincloths and women wear fresh leaves. Koma men are much more receptive to wearing of contemporary clothes than the women. Customarily inheritance in Koma is in the maternal lineage. As a mark of acceptance and friendship, a Koma man may share his wife with friends, especially visitors. They have an average population of about 400 people per village, and many engage in rearing of animals. The late Colonel Yohanna Madaki visited the mountains in 1989, at the insistence of the first set of corps members posted to the lowlands. ==Culture== Among the Komas, a twin birth is regarded as evil, and twins are considered abominable so much so that until recently babies of multiple births used to be buried alive with the women who had the 'misfortune' of being their mothers. This obnoxious practice of twins killing is out of vogue among Komas who dwell on the plains, but in the out-of-the-way settlements on the hills, the ancient practice still thrives untainted.http://archives.climbingforchrist.org/Default.aspx?tabid=2963 Koma medicine men engage in extended farting sessions on the occasion of public dancing ceremonies. They train with a master and are capable of farting for hours on end. When the anus area becomes irritated from prolonged flatulence, it is soothed with a healing powder. The tradition is thought to originate in mockery of puritanical Muslims, who used to enslave Komas and drove them to move their habitat into the hilly areas they now occupy. The tradition was famously documented in a documentary by Alain Baptizet. Koma people practice the three major religions in Nigeria; 60% of them are christians, 30% traditionalists and 20% muslims. ==References== http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/ancient-dna-recovered-from-clay- statues-reveal-secrets-of-mysterious-african-culture/ Category:Ethnic groups in Nigeria ","title":"Koma in Adamawa"},{"id":"35945655","text":"Maike Stöckel Maike Stöckel (born 6 March 1984 in Bielefeld) is a German field hockey player who competed in the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:German female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Germany Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Bielefeld Category:Field hockey players at the 2012 Summer Olympics ","title":"Maike Stöckel"},{"id":"35945669","text":"Janne Müller-Wieland (born 28 October 1986) is a German field hockey player who competed in the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics.Hockey.de profile ==References== Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:German female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Germany Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Germany Category:Olympic medalists in field hockey Category:Medalists at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Hamburg Category:Female field hockey defenders ","title":"Janne Müller-Wieland"},{"id":"35945683","text":"Christina Schütze Christina Schütze (also spelled Schuetze, born 25 October 1983) is a German field hockey player who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Olympics. ==References External links == * * * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:German female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Germany Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2012 Summer Olympics ","title":"Christina Schütze"},{"id":"35945696","text":"Pia Eidmann (born 26 August 1984) is a German field hockey player who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:German female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Germany Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics ","title":"Pia Eidmann"},{"id":"35945703","text":"The Outside-In Man is the twenty-second episode of the third series of the 1960s cult British spy-fi television series The Avengers, starring Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman.

It is believed that topological degeneracy implies topological order (or long-range entanglement ) in the ground state. Many-body states with topological degeneracy are described by topological quantum field theory at low energies. ==Background== Topological degeneracy was first introduced to physically define topological order. In two-dimensional space, the topological degeneracy depends on the topology of space, and the topological degeneracy on high genus Riemann surfaces encode all information on the quantum dimensions and the fusion algebra of the quasiparticles. In particular, the topological degeneracy on torus is equal to the number of quasiparticles types. The topological degeneracy also appears in the situation with topological defects (such as vortices, dislocations, holes in 2D sample, ends of a 1D sample, etc.), where the topological degeneracy depends on the number of defects. Braiding those topological defect leads to topologically protected non-Abelian geometric phase, which can be used to perform topologically protected quantum computation. Topological degeneracy of topological order can be defined on a closed space or an open space with gapped boundaries or gapped domain walls, including both Abelian topological orders and non-Abelian topological orders. The application of these types of systems for quantum computation has been proposed. In certain generalized cases, one can also design the systems with topological interfaces enriched or extended by global or gauge symmetries. The topological degeneracy also appear in non-interacting fermion systems (such as p+ip superconductors) with trapped defects (such as vortices). In non- interacting fermion systems, there is only one type of topological degeneracy where number of the degenerate states is given by 2^{N_d/2}/2, where N_d is the number of the defects (such as the number of vortices). Such topological degeneracy is referred as \\"Majorana zero-mode\\" on the defects. In contrast, there are many types of topological degeneracy for interacting systems. A systematic description of topological degeneracy is given by tensor category (or monoidal category) theory. ==See also== * Topological order * Quantum topology * Topological defect * Topological quantum field theory * Topological quantum number * Majorana fermion == References == Category:Quantum phases Category:Condensed matter physics ","title":"Topological degeneracy"},{"id":"35945714","text":"Thomas Massey McEwen (March 16, 1923 – June 5, 2011) was an American sportswriter who was born and spent most of his life in Florida. He was a graduate of the University of Florida, and is best known for being the popular sports editor at The Tampa Tribune daily newspaper in Tampa, Florida from 1962 until 1992. After retiring as editor, he continued to write a regular column and occasional articles for the print version of the Tribune until 2001, then for the online version of the newspaper (tbo.com) until shortly before his death in 2011. McEwen was the sports editor for Tampa's primary newspaper during an era of growth for The Tampa Tribune, the Tampa Bay area's professional sports profile, and Tampa in general. Some credit McEwen with being among the most influential newspaper sports journalists of his day, affecting major development for local sports and helping to facilitate the establishment of expansion sports franchises in the Tampa Bay area, most notably the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tampa Bay Rays, and Tampa Bay Lightning, and for being a supporter and chronicler of Florida's college sports programs, particularly at the University of Florida and, later, the University of South Florida. ==Early life and education== McEwen was born in Tampa in 1923 and grew up in rural Wauchula, Florida, where the cattle and citrus industries were most prominent. He followed his older brother James Milton \\"Red\\" McEwen to the University of Florida. While in college, Tom McEwen was the editor of The Alligator, the university's student newspaper, and earned a degree in journalism while his brother Red was a star on the Florida Gators football team and earned a degree in law. (Red McEwen later became a well-known lawyer and state attorney in Tampa and a booster of the University of South Florida's sports programs after the school was founded in the late 1950s.) ==Military service== It was from the University of Florida in 1944 that he was called to military service in the Pacific. He was trained at Fort Hood and arrived in the Philippines at the end of the occupation by the Japanese... \\"he entered as a private and exited as a captain while serving in the Pacific theater as a platoon leader with the U.S. Army's 785th Tank Battalion. Later, he served as a prison officer of Prisoner of War Camp No. 1 in the Philippines, running a camp that included 2,000 prisoners. He retained a military tie in the Army reserves and then the U.S. National Guard until his retirement from the Florida Guard in 1976, as lieutenant colonel. He received the Florida Order of Merit for his service in the guard.\\" Coming home from the Philippines, McEwen wrote sports for the Fort Myers News Press and the St. Petersburg Times in the 1950s. He was by the Tampa Times in June 1958, and then by The Tampa Tribune in April 1962. ==The Tampa Tribune== McEwen became sports editor for the Tribune in 1962, \\"when he took over a department with a staff of seven.\\" McEwen wrote The Morning After column six days a week, and a weekly question and answer column, Hey Tom!, which usually ran on Sundays. McEwen often made appearances as a speaker and developed a large network of civic minded local community leaders, nationally prominent athletes and team owners, and other influential people across the sports world. He is credited with helping Tampa gain acceptance in the top level of professional sports, particularly in the awarding of the National Football League franchise which became the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He also wrote many columns about the University of Florida's football program's coaches and players. Former Florida player and coach Steve Spurrier credits McEwen with helping him win the Heisman Trophy in 1966 and convincing Tampa Bay Bandits owner John F. Bassett to hire Spurrier for his first head coaching job in 1983. McEwen's first published book, The Gators: A Story of Florida Football, traces the history of UF's football program from its beginnings until 1974, when the book was written. It is estimated that McEwen wrote over 10,000 columns and articles, and he traveled to many of the major sporting events of his day, both domestically and internationally. His column sometimes covered subjects other than sports, such as eulogies of someone of note or a loved one, and sometimes began with a \\"Breakfast Bonus\\" section in which he described a large southern-style breakfast in detail before turning the discussion back to sports. When he retired from his post as sports editor in 1992, the department had grown from 7 employees to 57. Even after his official retirement, McEwen continued to write for the Tribune and produced a collection of his works. ==Recognition and legacy== McEwen has been recognized for his sportswriting as well as being recipient of multiple awards. He won the Florida Sportswriter of the Year award 19 times, between the years 1962 and 1993 and in 2000, was the recipient of the Dick McCann Memorial Award for long and distinguished reporting in the field of pro football in the Canton NFL Hall of Fame ceremonies, presented by Pro Football Writers of America. He served as president of the Football Writers Association of America from 1973-74. And in 1993, the Associated Press Sports Editors presented McEwen with the Red Smith Award. Locally, the press boxes at the original Tampa Stadium and Amalie Arena were named for McEwen. The street in front of Raymond James Stadium, today's home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, bears his name. McEwen was honored as a distinguished graduate by the University of Florida and an athletic scholarship was endowed in his name. He conducted seminars in sportswriting at the American Press Institute at Columbia University. His final tribute was for a doctor of letters given in 2011 by Saint Leo University, a Catholic university 35 miles north of Tampa. In 2012, the Tom McEwen Family Foundation was established to raise money for scholarships for aspiring sports journalists. ==References== Category:1923 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Dick McCann Memorial Award recipients Category:Red Smith Award recipients Category:Sportswriters from Florida Category:People from Wauchula, Florida ","title":"Tom McEwen (sportswriter)"},{"id":"35945717","text":"Julia Müller (born 10 December 1985) is a German field hockey national team player who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics. ==References External links == * * * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:German female field hockey players Category:Olympic field hockey players of Germany Category:Field hockey players at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Field hockey players at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Germany Category:Olympic medalists in field hockey Category:Medalists at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Hamburg ","title":"Julia Müller"},{"id":"35945721","text":"Kristina Reynolds (born 18 February 1984) is a German field hockey player who competed in the 2008 Summer Olympics.

The agency polices Washington County, population 150,926 (2018), a 467-sq mile rural county in the state of Maryland. The office is a full service agency, which means the Sheriff, Douglas W. Mullendore, and his deputies do patrol work and enforce laws as police officers, provide security in the circuit court system and operate the county jail. Hagerstown, where the county seat is, has its own police department. ==Brief history== Since its inception in the 18th century, the Sheriff's Office has had a total of 79 Sheriffs. The first elected man to the job was George Hershey. He served from 1777 to 1780. The Sheriff's term in office was reduced to two years in 1850 until 1946 when it was extended to a four-year term, a rule that remains to date. The current Sheriff, Mullendore, was elected in 2006. ==Divisions== The Sheriff's Office has three main divisions: patrol, judicial and detention. The patrol division is the backbone and flagship department of the office. Deputies enforce traffic laws and respond to calls for service in unincorporated areas of the county. They share jurisdiction with the Maryland State Police Hagerstown barrack. The patrol department operates with special units within itself such as investigations, gangs, school resource program, K-9 and traffic interdiction. The division has a Special Response Team that includes officers from the Hagerstown Police Department. It also includes the Washington County Narcotics Task Force which has deputies and police officers from the city of Hagerstown. Deputies assigned to the judicial division protect the Washington County Circuit Court building in Hagerstown. Their role is to provide security to the court's staff and visitors during trials, transport suspects from the county jail to court for judicial proceedings, and serve civil process papers. Judicial deputies are sworn law enforcement officers that have arrest powers just like patrol deputies. They can, in theory, conduct traffic stops and respond to calls for service although it is not their primary mission. The detention division is housed in the same complex as the patrol division, on Western Maryland Parkway, and has been since 1984. The detention center can house a total of 458 inmates and is the first point of contact or gateway to all persons arrested in Washington County by law enforcement agencies. Depending on the type of crime (state or federal) and/or length of sentence, convicted criminals may remain at the jail to serve their sentence or be transferred to either a state or federal facility. Deputies working at the county jail are not sworn officers (unlike in some states like California where some detention deputies are sworn and police-trained but work in jails in their rookie years, or Virginia). Although they wear the same uniform as patrol and judicial deputies, they typically do not have any police powers outside the detention center and do not carry firearms. Since April 2019, the Washington County Sheriff's Office and the Hagerstown Police Department have been operating a joint entry level training academy for their recruits and new hires from other smaller agencies in Washington County and beyond. Until construction of an actual building is complete, classes are held on Hagerstown Community College property. The first class graduated on October 15th 2019 with 11 new law enforcement officers. ==Killed in the line of duty== The Officer Down Memorial Page website lists one on-duty death in the history of the Sheriff's Office. Constable Thomas E. Hardy was shot and killed on Oct. 10, 1905 while conducting a patrol check on a train along with two other officers near Weverton Station. The suspect, the website says, was arrested. ==Trivia== \\\\- Sheriff George Swearingen, elected in 1827, ended his term two years later when he was sentenced to death by hanging for the murder of his wife. \\\\- Sheriff Charles Price, elected in 1958, died while in office (literally). The death was ruled a suicide. ==See also== *List of law enforcement agencies in Maryland ==References== *2010 Annual report *A history of the Washington County Sheriff's Office *Officer Down Memorial Page *11 Graduates from Washington County Police Academy ==External links== *Washington County Sheriff's Office homepage *Washington County Government homepage Category:Sheriffs' offices of Maryland Category:Washington County, Maryland ","title":"Washington County Sheriff's Office (Maryland)"},{"id":"35945777","text":"The 2012 U.S. Women's Open was the 67th U.S. Women's Open, held July 5–8 at Blackwolf Run in Kohler, Wisconsin.LPGA, U.S. Women's Open Info Accessed May 26, 2012 Na Yeon Choi won her first major championship, four strokes ahead of runner-up Amy Yang.

The word calaboose is a corruption of the Spanish word calabozo, which means dungeon. The building was built for and used as a jail in frontier Iowa. The walls and roof of the one-story structure are composed of limestone and mortar. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. ==History== When the Davenport, St. Paul and Midland railroad was being built the town of Delmar had yet to be incorporated, but it had a prosperous liquor trade serving the construction workers. It had become such a problem by the time the town incorporated in 1876 that the town council increased the licensing fees on liquor dealers and saloon keepers to regulate the trade. The plan did not work as those in the liquor trade refused to buy the licenses. Other citizens in Delmar demanded the construction of a town jail. A committee was established in March 1877 to study the possibility, and they recommended that the old school building be used for a jail. It is not known if the plan was ever carried out, but by early 1878 there was a strong desire to build a new jail. Another committee was formed in April of that year to recommend a site and plan a new building. By early summer property on Vane Street was purchased for $50 and the council approved plans for a stone structure. A.T. Phillips, a local builder, submitted the low bid of $175 and construction began immediately. The calaboose was completed in early October 1878 and the town took possession of it. The small jail is the oldest extant public building in Delmar, and the town would use it well into the twentieth century. Similar structures are throughout the United States ==Architecture== The calaboose is a structure. The vaulted concrete roof is high. The walls of locally quarried sandstone are thick. Narrow window slits with grated openings are located on the east and west elevations of the building. The main entrance into the structure is a heavy cast iron door with strap hinges and a grated opening located on the south elevation. The interior is a single room that is sheathed in plaster without ornamentation. The furnishings include a stove, folding cot, bureau, table, and chair that appear to be from the early twentieth century. ==References== Category:Government buildings completed in 1878 Category:Buildings and structures in Clinton County, Iowa Category:Jails on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Clinton County, Iowa Category:Vernacular architecture in Iowa Category:Jails in Iowa ","title":"Delmar Calaboose"},{"id":"35945816","text":"Huseklepp is a surname.

He is considered the most prominent Catalan philosopher of the 20th-century and was the author of over 35 books, including a four-volume Diccionario de filosofía (Dictionary of Philosophy, 1941) and Being and Death: An Outline of Integrationist Philosophy (1962). Subjects he worked on include ontology, history of philosophy, metaphysics, anthropology, the philosophy of history and culture, epistemology, logic, philosophy of science, and ethics. He also directed several films. Ferrater Mora was known for his inclusion of humans and non-human animals within the same moral sphere, or continuum, arguing that the difference was one of degree, not kind; the Ferrater Mora Oxford Centre for Animal Ethics is named in his honour. ==Biography== Ferrater Mora was born in 1912, in Barcelona, Spain. He studied at Santa Maria del Collell, then at the University of Barcelona, where he earned a BA, in 1932, and his BPhil, in 1936. During the Spanish Civil War, he enlisted in the Republican Army, serving as an intelligence clerk, before escaping the country in 1939. In exile, he spent three months in Paris, before moving to and lecturing in Havana, Cuba and Santiago, Chile. After receiving a Guggenheim Fellowship, he moved to the United States, first residing in New York City. In 1949, Ferrater Mora was hired by Bryn Mawr College to teach philosophy and Spanish literature, where he worked till his retirement, in 1981. He married Priscilla Cohn (his former doctoral student) in 1980. Ferrater Mora died from a heart attack, on 30 January 1991, while visiting Barcelona. ==Philosophy== Ferrater Mora is the creator of a philosophical method he called integrationism, with which he sought to integrate opposite systems of thought. He argued that irreducible concepts, which are the source of many disputes and divisions in philosophy, do not denote existing realities in themselves but are \\"limit concepts\\"; that is to say, these \\"opposite poles\\" do not exist absolutely. They exist only as trends or directions of reality and therefore are complementary and are useful to talk about it. His philosophical work also focused on questions of an ontological nature. He called his ontological position \\"monism sui generis\\", since it unites monism and pluralism; it is an emergentism in which the elements assemble themselves by virtue of their properties or functions, or properties-functions. Each structure, although it depends to exist on the elements that compose it, is not reducible to them because it acquires new properties-functions that cannot be explained based on those of the element. The structure also becomes an element for a new structure. Self-assembly begins from the physical level to the point where structures acquire more complex properties-functions and of a different order to give rise to a new biological level, and thus the continuum progresses until reaching the social and then the cultural level. It is a continuum that does not break and that goes from matter to reason. He was one of the first philosophers to introduce applied ethics to the Spanish-speaking world and was a staunch supporter of animal rights. His works combine a wide variety of influences, including the Spanish philosophers Miguel de Unamuno, Eugeni d'Ors and José Ortega y Gasset and numerous other representatives of both continental and analytic philosophy. ==Legacy== In January 1991, Ferrater Mora made public the decision to donate his personal library to the University of Girona. The collection consists of 7,255 books, 156 journal titles and correspondence, with 6,748 letters. The correspondence includes letters between Ferrater Mora and his friends, politicians and intellectuals of the time. This collection also includes letters from his departure into exile in the 1940s (Cuba, Chile and the United States), until his death in 1991. Other documents of interest include related writings, with politics and culture sent by personalities of the time: Xavier Benguerel, Enrique Tierno Galván, Néstor Almendros and Josep Trueta, among many others. Founded in 1989, the Ferrater Mora Chair in Contemporary Thought, regularly organizes seminars and lessons on contemporary philosophy. ==Selected works== The following works are in Spanish, unless otherwise noted: * Dictionary of Philosophy (Mexico: Atlante, 1941) * Spain and Europe (Santiago de Chile: Cruz del Sur, 1942) * The Forms of Catalan Life (Santiago de Chile: Agrupació Patriòtica Catalana, 1944), in Catalan and Spanish * Unamuno: Outline of a Philosophy (Buenos Aires: Losada, 1944) * Four Visions of Universal History (Buenos Aires: Losada, 1945) * Spanish Issues (Mexico: Colegio de México, 1945) * Variations on the Spirit (Buenos Aires: South American, 1945) * The Irony, the Death and the Admiration (Santiago de Chile: Cruz del Sur, 1946) * The Meaning of Death (Buenos Aires: South American, 1947) * The Book of Meaning (Santiago de Chile: Pi de les Tres Branques, 1948), in Catalan * Hellenism and Christianity (Santiago de Chile: University of Chile, 1949) * The Man at the Crossroads (Buenos Aires: South American, 1952) * Disputed Questions: Essays on Philosophy (Madrid: Revista de Occidente, 1955) * Mathematical Logic (Mexico: Fondo de Cultura Económica, 1955), co-authored with Hugues Leblanc * Ortega y Gasset: An Outline of His Philosophy (London: Bowes and New Haven: Yale University, 1957), in English * What Is Logic (Buenos Aires: Columba, 1957) * Philosophy in Today's World (Madrid: Revista de Occidente, 1959) * Being and Death: Outline of Integrationist Philosophy (Madrid: Aguilar, 1962) * Three Worlds: Catalonia, Spain, Europe (Barcelona and Buenos Aires: EDHASA, 1963) * Being and Meaning (Madrid: Revista de Occidente, 1967) * Inquiries About Language (Madrid: Alianza, 1970) * Words and Men (Barcelona: 62, 1970), in Catalan * Man and His Environment and Other Essays (Madrid: Siglo Veintiuno, 1971) * Shift in Philosophy (Madrid: Alianza, 1974) * Cinema Without Philosophies (Madrid: Esti-Arte, 1974) * From Matter to Reason (Madrid: Alianza, 1979) * Seven Capital Stories (Barcelona: Planeta, 1979) * Applied Ethics: From Abortion to Violence (Madrid: Alianza, 1981), co-authored with Priscilla Cohn * Claudia, My Claudia (Madrid: Alianza, 1982) * The World of the Writer (Barcelona: Crítica, 1983) * Ways of Doing Philosophy (Barcelona: Crítica, 1985) * Voltaire in New York (Madrid: Alianza, 1985) * Foundations of Philosophy (Madrid: Alianza, 1985) * Made in Corona (Madrid: Alianza, 1986) * Window to the World (Barcelona: Crítica, 1986) * Dictionary of Great Philosophers 2 (Madrid: Alianza, 1986) * The Truth Game (Barcelona: Ediciones Destino, 1988) * Return from Hell (Barcelona: Anthropos, 1989) * Miss Goldie (Barcelona: Seix Barral, 1991) * Women on the Verge of Legend (Barcelona: Círculo de readers, 1991) * Butterflies and Superstrings: Dictionary for Our Time (Barcelona: Peninsula, 1994) ==Awards== * Ferrater Mora received honorary degrees from the following universities: the Autonomous University of Barcelona (Spain, 1979), the University of the Republic (Uruguay, 1983), the National University of Tucumán (Argentina, 1983), the National University of Colombia (1983), the National University of Distance Education (Spain, 1986), the National University of Salta (Argentina, 1986), the National University of Cuyo (Argentina, 1988), the University of Barcelona (1988) and the University of Santiago de Compostela (posthumous; Spain, 1991). * In 1982, he was awarded the Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic. * In 1984, he was awarded the Creu de Sant Jordi of the Generalitat de Catalunya and the Grand Cross of the Civil Order of Alfonso X, the Wise. * In 1985, he was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Communication and Humanities. * In addition to being a numerus clausus member of the International Institute of Philosophy and various academic societies, he belonged to the North American Academy of the Spanish Language. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Horta, Óscar.

Lérida)) was a Spanish Roman Catholic bishop and cardinal. ==Biography== Antonio Cerdà i Lloscos was born in Santa Margalida in 1390. He studied humanities at Palma, Majorca and then attended the University of Lleida, receiving a doctorate in Christian theology. After he was ordained as a priest, he became a canon of Palma Cathedral. He joined the Trinitarian Order at the monastery of the Holy Spirit in Mallorca. He later became professor of moral theology, Scholastic theology, Sacred Scripture, and canon law at the University of Lleida. As first definitor of the Trinitarian Order, he attended the General Chapter of the order held in Amiens on April 4, 1429. After redacting the Trinitarian Order's new constitutions, he spent two years visiting the Trinitarian convents in the Kingdom of England, the Lordship of Ireland, and the Kingdom of Scotland, and later in Spain and Italy as well. The Roman Curia then named him procurator general of his order. Pope Eugene IV brought Cerdà into the papal household, making him his privy chamberlain. He soon became auditor of the Roman Rota. Pope Nicholas V later named him as the pope's counselor in matters of theology and philosophy. Upon the recommendation of Alfonso V of Aragon, he was elected Archbishop of Messina on July 8, 1447, with Pope Nicholas V confirming the election on January 8, 1448. He also became commendatory abbot of Valldigna. Bishop Cerdà did not participate in the Council of Florence (1431–49). Pope Nicholas V made Cerdà a cardinal in the consistory of February 16, 1448. He received the red hat and the titular church of San Crisogono on February 17, 1448. He was translated to the see of Lleida on March 28, 1449; he took possession of the see by a procurator and continued to reside in Rome. On April 29, 1449, he resigned as commendatory abbot of Valldigna. He attended the secret consistory of October 27, 1451, and later participated in the papal conclave of 1455 that elected Pope Callixtus III. He served as apostolic administrator of the see of Giovinazzo from June 6, 1455 until 1458, and as administrator of the Archdiocese of Ravenna from June 28, 1455. He served as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals for the year 1456. As legate in the Marche, he helped conclude the peace negotiations between the Republic of Florence and Alfonso V of Aragon. He was present at the death of Pope Callixtus III on August 6, 1458. He then participated in the papal conclave of 1458 that elected Pope Pius II. He died in Rome on September 12, 1459. He is buried in St. Peter's Basilica. ==References== Category:1390 births Category:1459 deaths Category:Spanish cardinals Category:Trinitarian bishops ","title":"Antonio Cerdà i Lloscos"},{"id":"35945901","text":"Jonathan Francis \\"Jon\\" Wyatt (born 12 February 1973) is a British former field hockey player who competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics and in the 2000 Summer Olympics.

The main house was built by Francis Taliaferro Brooke in 1794, with an addition added in 1812. There are several outbuildings that surround the main house. They include a slave quarters, smokehouse, milk house and law office used by Francis Brooke. Though relatively small in size, the home is exemplary of Federal architecture. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in June 1975 ==Design== The house is a two-story, single-pile (only one room between the front and back of the building), Federal structure. St. Julien has a five-bay front. An unusual design element of the house is the in antis, or recessed portico at the summit of stone steps up to the front door. The most distinctive feature of St. Julien is its entrance bay. The balcony of the portico is faced with a smaller scale version of the modillion-and-fretwork cornice that encircles the house. A fanlight with wooden mullions. Above the front door, on the second floor, a door and sidelights mirror the portico's design. The house has a hip roof covered with sheet metal with interior end chimneys. ==History== St. Julien was the home of Francis Taliaferro Brooke (1763-1851), an important figure in early Virginia politics. Brooke was elected to the State Senate in 1800 and appointed a Judge of the General Court in 1804. Brook eventually became the President of the Supreme Court of Appeals in Virginia. Brook purchased in Spotsylvania County in 1796 when he moved his practice and residence to Fredericksburg, Virginia. This tract became St. Julien. Henry Clay was a frequent visitor to St. Julien. Brooke lived on the plantation from the time of the building of the house until his death there in 1851. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia Category:Federal architecture in Virginia Category:Houses completed in 1794 Category:Houses in Spotsylvania County, Virginia Category:Houses completed in 1812 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Spotsylvania County, Virginia Category:Taliaferro family of Virginia Category:1794 establishments in Virginia Category:Slave cabins and quarters in the United States ","title":"St. Julien (Spotsylvania County, Virginia)"},{"id":"35945974","text":"Simon Hazlitt (born 16 October 1966) is a British former field hockey player who competed in the 1996 Summer Olympics.

It was written by Perry, Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, Stacy Barthe, and Monte Neuble. Stewart handled the production of the song, while Kuk Harrell produced Perry's vocals. \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" was inspired by Perry's boyfriend at the time, Russell Brand. Musically, it is a 1980s-styled hard rock song that contains a mixture of elements from rock and electronica. Lyrically, the song compares the feeling of being in love to the speed of a hummingbird's heartbeat. \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" was serviced to Australian radio as the seventh and final single from Teenage Dream on September 17, 2012. The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, many of whom labeled it as a potential single choice. Upon the release of Teenage Dream, \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" charted on the lower regions of the South Korea Gaon International Chart, peaking at 124. == Background and composition == Perry was inspired to write the song after she began dating Russell Brand In an interview with YouTube about Teenage Dream in August 2010, Perry revealed that \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" was one of the first songs she wrote for the album after she finished her Hello Katy Tour (2009). When speaking about the song, Perry said she first had the idea for the song while she was in her hometown of Santa Barbara, California: \\"I was at breakfast when I saw this hummingbird, and hummingbird was having breakfast as well..... and I don't know if you know but hummingbirds are supposedly good luck and I was just thinking about hummingbirds. I was thinking 'How fast does their heart beat?' , like 'how many beats per minute?' And using that idea as an idea for someone making you feel, instead of those butterflies, making your heart beat really, really fast.\\" \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" is a 1980s-styled hard rock song that contains a mixture of elements from rock and electronica. It is written in the key of F major, and the tempo moves at 122 beats per minute over a moderate beat. Perry's vocal range in the song spans from the lower note of A3 to the higher note of D5. The intro and chorus follow a chord progression of F/B–C–Am7–Bmaj9, while the verses follow one of Dm7–C–F7–Bmaj9. The song encompasses electric guitars, a piano, and synthesizers in its production. The song also features an acoustic drum kit, unlike the other songs in the album. == Release and reception == Perry performing \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" during California Dreams Tour Upon the release of the Teenage Dream album, \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" charted on the lower regions of the South Korea Gaon International Chart, peaking at 124.

Since his release from prison, Kimberlin has co-founded the non-profit Justice Through Music Project and the activist organization Velvet Revolution. He has also been involved in various legal disputes, including those associated with a claim that he supplied marijuana to Dan Quayle. == Criminal convictions == Shortly after graduating from high school, Kimberlin was convicted in 1973 of felony perjury for lying to a grand jury investigating drug trafficking. Kimberlin had been called before a grand jury investigating drug use at his high school and was convicted for testifying that he had not sold LSD. Kimberlin served only 21 days of a one-year sentence on this charge. By 1976, Kimberlin's drug business was grossing hundreds of thousands of dollars a month.Singer 1996, p. 57. Kimberlin invested his free cash in such businesses as a retail health food store, a vegetarian restaurant, and an Earth shoe franchise. However, Kimberlin became a suspect in the murder of Julia Scyphers, the mother of a friend/employee of his in Speedway, Indiana in 1978.Singer 1996, p. 58. In the first six days of September 1978, a series of bombings struck Speedway. Initially there were no injuries; however, the last bombing led to the amputation of Vietnam veteran Carl DeLong's right leg, and left DeLong and his wife with several other injuries that required significant hospitalization and rehabilitation. DeLong committed suicide in February 1983. Investigators traced the Mark-Time timer and the Tovex 200 used in the bombings to Kimberlin, and he was placed under surveillance.Singer 1996, pp. 59-60. The police believed that Kimberlin had conducted the Speedway bombings to divert attention from the murder investigation. On September 20, 1978, Kimberlin was then arrested by the FBI for an entirely different charge—possession and illegal use of Department of Defense insignia, illegal use of the Seal of the President of the United States, and impersonation of a federal officer, after the FBI received a tip from a print shop owner.Singer 1996, p. 60. Between one and two weeks later, he was released although the charges were not dismissed. A few months later, on February 16, 1979, Kimberlin was at a makeshift airport in Texas to supervise the unloading of an airplane, when bad weather and low fuel led the airplane's crew to jettison a shipment of 10,000 pounds of marijuana from Colombia (in 50-pound bales) over a wide area of southeastern Texas so that the plane could land at a real airport. Kimberlin was arrested a few hours later while trying to retrieve the bales. In June 1980 Kimberlin was convicted in a Texas federal court of conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute and given a four-year sentence. In a separate trial in November 1980, he was convicted of possession and illegal use of Department of Defense insignia, illegal use of the Seal of the President of the United States, and impersonation of a federal officer. Finally, Kimberlin was convicted of the Speedway bombing in a trial that took 53 days and included 118 witnesses, and his sentences for all of his convictions were aggregated to a total sentence of 50 years. Kimberlin was released on parole in February 1994 after serving 13 years, but his parole was revoked in 1997 for failure to pay the civil judgments against him, and he was returned to prison for four more years before his release in 2001. ==Dan Quayle marijuana charges== In November 1988, while Kimberlin was in federal prison, National Public Radio reporter Nina Totenberg reported that Kimberlin claimed to have sold marijuana to Republican Vice Presidential candidate Dan Quayle, while Quayle was in law school in Indianapolis.Singer 1992, p. 117-119. Kimberlin was put in administrative detention on three separate occasions when he had planned to hold press conferences regarding his claims, leaving him unable to speak to reporters until the week after the election.Singer 1992, pp. 120-122. Kimberlin's claims received renewed attention prior to the 1992 election, when Quayle was running for re-election.Singer 1992, p. 108. During this time, Kimberlin proclaimed his innocence with regard to the Speedway bombings and blamed his late younger brother, Scott, for the presence of the evidence that linked him to them.Singer 1992, pp. 114-115, After Kimberlin's parole the next year, he signed a contract with New Yorker staff writer Mark Singer, who had written a positive profile of Kimberlin in 1992, to publish a book about his claims regarding both his conviction and his relationship with Quayle.Singer 1996, p. 56 However, Singer \\"decided that [he] had been lied to repeatedly by Kimberlin.\\" Singer concluded that Kimberlin “was not telling the truth about Quayle.” In print, Singer said he believed Kimberlin had known someone who had claimed to sell marijuana to Quayle and had then appropriated the story as his own.Singer 1996, p. 70. ==Political activism and nonprofit work== While in prison, Kimberlin became known as an \\"exceptionally adroit jailhouse lawyer.\\"Singer 1996, p. 55. He became involved in the cause of an emigre from the former Soviet Union who was convicted of heroin possession and trapped in INS detention limbo since he could not be released in the U.S. and also could not be returned to Russia because of his drug conviction. Following Kimberlin's release from prison, he attracted attention with an offer to pay $100,000 (later $500,000) to anyone with evidence that the 2004 United States presidential election had been \\"stolen\\" by George W. Bush. Kimberlin also achieved some national prominence as an opponent of direct-recording electronic voting machines, including theories related to rigging elections by using them. According to Time magazine, he leveraged this public attention to organize both the \\"Velvet Revolution\\" activist site and the \\"Justice Through Music Project\\" nonprofit organization. He has given interviews discussing \\"music activism\\" on behalf of the Justice Through Music Project to groups such as Public Radio Exchange. The Justice Through Music Project has also posted music videos opposing torture by the United States and opposing referendum efforts to ban same-sex marriage. ==Litigation== Kimberlin, the son of a lawyer, has been involved in extensive litigation over the years. By 1992, he had already filed over 100 motions and lawsuits in federal courts on his own behalf,Singer 1996, p. 62. including a lawsuit against Senator Orrin Hatch in 1999. The case against Hatch was dismissed in DC's District Court. === Blog About Brett Kimberlin Day === In March 2012, writer Lee Stranahan announced “Everybody Blog about Brett Kimberlin Day.http://leestranahan.com/friday- may-25th-is-everybody-blog-about-brett-kimberlin-day/ In May 2012 Slate reported that conservative bloggers were criticizing Kimberlin in an event called \\"Blog About Brett Kimberlin Day,\\" apparently based on litigation brought by Kimberlin against the bloggers. Two bloggers who had written about Kimberlin said they were the victim of swatting, hoaxes that brought armed police officers to their homes. Kimberlin denied any connection to the incidents. On June 6, 2012, Senator Saxby Chambliss sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder requesting an investigation of the swatting cases. Kimberlin repeated his denial of any involvement in the hoax calls. ==References== Category:1954 births Category:American drug traffickers Category:American perjurers Category:Living people Category:Criminals from Indiana Category:American political activists Category:Prisoners and detainees of the United States federal government Category:Bombers (people) ","title":"Brett Kimberlin"},{"id":"35946071","text":"St Mungo's.

An adaptation from a Classical Latin source, it gained some currency in England during the 18th century and later in Russia, via Ivan Krylov’s 19th-century adaptation. In France it eventually served as the basis for a number of dramatic adaptations as well. ==A fable of dependency== La Fontaine's account is based on a story told by Horace in his verse epistle to Maecenas (I.7)Horace: Satires, Epistles, Ars Poetica, Loeb edition, London 1942, lines 45-95 concerning the lawyer Philippus and the crier Volteius Mena. The lawyer amuses himself by befriending a carefree and contented man and destroys his peace of mind by presenting him with the means to buy a farm. It is a disaster and eventually his client begs Philippus to return him to his former way of life. In the poem, Horace is pointing out to Maecenas that the obligations of his client status should not be urged to the point of damaging his health and that, if he cannot be allowed his independence, he is ready to return the benefits he has received in the past. The story he tells follows immediately after a shorter reference to one of Aesop's animal fables pointing to the same conclusion, \\"The Fox and the Weasel\\". La Fontaine adapts the story to the circumstances of his own century.[“The Cobbler and the Financier, trans. Paul Hookham, Wikisource pp.339-41 A Financier's troubled rest is broken by the merry singing of a cobbler. The man of affairs interviews the workman about his business and offers him a gift of a hundred crowns to insure against a rainy day. Worry over the security of his nest-egg destroys the cobbler's own rest and allows the financier a period of unbroken repose. Finally the cobbler brings back the money and demands the return of his songs and his sleep. This particular passage is based, not on the story but on Horace's suggestion to Maecenas in the poem that he should give him back his health and light-hearted laughter (lines 25-8). The poem is also marked by many memorable lines, including the financier's wish that sleep was a commodity to be bought at market and the cobbler's suspicion that his roaming cat is after his money. A fable that follows La Fontaine's account fairly closely was included soon after in Roger L'Estrange's Fables of Aesop and Other Eminent Mythologists (1692)Fable 402, “A Cobler and a Financier”, p.372 and a verse translation of La Fontaine appeared later in Charles Denis' Select Fables (1754).Fable 112, “The Cobler and his Neighbour”, pp.415-8 However, Jonathan Swift had already made a humorous adaptation of Horace's poem at the start of the 18th century, retelling the story of his ruinous patronage by the Earl of Oxford in a more direct manner than had Horace, and in the process drawing out the original forty lines of the Latin author to 140 in octosyllabic couplets.\\"To the Earl of Oxford\\" (1713) ==InterpretationsArtistic=== The final episode from La Fontaine's fable on a plate, c.1810 While many French illustrations of this popular story portray the cobbler in the financier's presence, two Russian depictions present him singing at his work. This is so in a 1951 pencil illustration by Valentin Serov to Ivan Krylov's Russian translationThe Tax- Farmer and the Cobbler, V. A. Serov, \\"Illustrations to I. A. Krylov's fables\\", Leningrad and in Marc Chagall’s coloured etching from 1952.Goldmark Gallery Earlier on in Russia, Krylov's translation has been adapted into a four-panel lubok at least twice, each time using the same designs. These consisted of a band of four illustrations across the top of the sheet, followed by the poem in three columns beneath. The episodes there included the tax-farmer (in this version) being served at table by a servant; the cobbler receiving the money (five hundred rubles in this variant) in a bag; burying the money under the floor of his cabin; and returning the bag to his benefactor.Runivers: Today and Yesterday (Сегодня и вчера), 1869 lithographGrafika: Money, Genre scenes, Russia (Деньги, Жанровые сцены, Российская империя), 1894 woodcut There were also several French composite publications combining the text of La Fontaine’s fable with serial illustrations. These included separate sheets by Hermann Vogel, which could also be combined in an album,Le Musée de l’image, Épinal and Louis-Maurice Boutet de Monvel’s Jean de La Fontaine, 26 fables,Wikiversity both published in 1888. Later there was Benjamin Rabier’s complete edition of the Fables of 1906, also illustrated in this form.Fables de La Fontaine illustrées par Benjamin Rabier, Paris 1906, pp.170-1 A different kind of illustration followed later in the 20th century in the form of a comic strip. In Marcel Gotlib’s 1970 update of the fable, it is contemporary hit songs like \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and \\"Nights In White Satin\\" with which the carefree cobbler breaks the investment banker’s rest. Silenced by being presented with a 100 ECU cheque, the cobbler regains his lightness of heart by bringing the money back for the banker to invest on his behalf.Bertrand Thierry Earlier in the 20th century, the Art Deco sculptor Max Le Verrier (1891-1973) created a pair of metal book ends based on the fable. The two figures are represented in 17th century dress and present a contrast between lack and luxury. On one side the cobbler is sitting on a stool and focusses on his task while on the other the care-worn financier is in an armchair grasping the money bags in his lap.Paire De Serre-Livres Signée Le Verrier/ Le Savetier et le Financier ===Dramatic and musical=== During the 18th-century the fable was given several dramatic adaptations in which the story-line is more or less the same, but with additional male and female characters so as to lengthen the performance and provide romantic interest. The earliest was the popular L’Embarras des Richesses (Troublesome Riches) by Léonor Jean Christine Soulas d'Allainval, a 1725 prose comedy in three acts which added two sets of lovers to the cast.L' Embarras des Richesses, Paris 1725. It was followed by a two-act comedy interspersed with lyrics by Maximilien-Jean Boutillier (1745-1811) in 1761,Le Savetier et le financier : comedie en deux actes, par M***, Google Books and shortly after that by Toussaint-Gaspard Taconet’s two-act opéra comique of 1765.L'Esprit des journaux franc̜ais et étrangers, Brussels 1818, vol.13, p.239 Later there was another comic opera in much the same form by Jean Baptiste Lourdet de Santerre (1732 – 1815), with music by Henri-Joseph Rigel.Le savetier et le financier: opéra comique en deux actes, en prose mêlée d'ariettes, Google Books As the 1778 performance of that work met with no success, it was replaced in 1782 with a three-act musical comedy (comédie lyrique) set by André Grétry with the new title of L'Embarras des Richesses,University of Gent borrowed from D’Allainval’s earlier work, which still continued in print. Following the French Revolution, there were further attempts to give the fable new dramatic life. Les Deux Voisins was a prose comedy with sung intervals by Charles J. La Roche which had a single night’s performance in 1791.Le Théâtre français de la Révolution à l'Empire This was followed in 1793 by Pierre-Antoine-Augustin de Piis’ much more successful musical, Le Savetier et le Financier, which had repeated performances over the following years.Le Théâtre français de la Révolution à l'Empire The subject was taken up again in another one-act musical in 1815, Le Savetier et le Financier ou Contentement Passe Richesse (Better than wealth is content), by Nicolas Brazier and Jean-Toussaint Merle.Le Savetier et le Financier: Comédie-vaudeville en un acte This was successful enough for a scene from the production to appear as a commercial chimney plaque soon after.Osenat Later in the 19th century, Jacques Offenbach, having already set the fable for soloist and small orchestra as part of his 6 fables de la Fontaine in 1842,There is a performance on YouTube wrote the music for a one-act comic opera, Le financier et le savetier (1856), with a script by Hector-Jonathan CrémieuxLe financier et le savetier : opérette- bouffe en un acte, Paris Specialist Libraries in which the heroine sings a parody of his own setting. In that light-hearted entertainment, the cobbler turns the tables on his opponent by using the 300 crowns he is given to beat the financier at cards, taking over all his assets and winning the hand of his daughter, Aubépine.There is a 45-minute performance of the work on YouTube It was followed in about 1870 by a one-act bouffonerie musicale (knock-about musical) by (Mme) Sounier Geoffroy.Title page of the score A later setting of just the fable itself was for children's choir and orchestra by Ida Gotkovsky as the final section of her Hommage à Jean de La Fontaine (1995).HOMMAGE A JEAN DE LA FONTAINE, ChantefablesA performance of the whole work on You Tube At least three early silent films were also based on the fable: Le Savetier et le Financier of 1909, made by La Société des Etablissements L. Gaumont,IMDb another with the same title made in 1912 by La Société Française des Films Éclairs,IMDb and a 1911 Russian movie based on two of Ivan Krylov's fables including \\"The Tax-Farmer and the Cobbler\\" (currently considered lost).The \\"Early Russian Film Prose\\" research and study group, 1911 ==Attitudes to wealth== The score of Aubépine's solo from Offenbach's opera The original fable as told by Horace occurs in a criticism of the dependent client-patron relationship and the anxiety it brings. His advice at the end is that it is better to retain one's independence for \\"it is right that each should measure himself by his own rule and standard\\" (Epistle 7, line 98). Swift followed him in applying the story to his own circumstances. But La Fontaine used the fable differently and changed the status of his protagonist to that of an artisan who, when questioned by the financier, admits to living from hand to mouth. The focus of the story centres on the consequences of an upward change in financial standing: \\"From the moment he gained what hurts us so\\" (line 40), the cobbler's sleep was as troubled as the banker's. Though La Fontaine was also dependent on others, he does not apply the fable so openly to himself; for him the problem is not the client status but the personal consequences of possession. When the story was adapted to musical comedy in France, its moral was often incorporated into the vaudeville at the close. D'Allainval's comedy spells out explicitly what is largely implicit in La Fontaine: \\"Riches and vain honours/ Are chains that weigh life down\\" (p. 116). Grégoire's self- criticism at the end of Boutiller's play is that, blinded by riches, he mistook their possession for happiness (p. 56). Similarly in Lourdet de Santerre's ending, Gregoire begins his song with \\"Gold does not make you happy\\", while the chorus at the end of his and the cast's succeeding stanzas draws the proverbial conclusion that \\"Contentment passes riches\\" (pp. 63–4). That same sentiment, Contentement Passe Richesse, was made the subtitle of the 1815 version of the fable, in which Sans-Quartier, Grégoire's counterpart, sings that \\"Money’s the root of all evil\\" (p. 32). Other adaptations shifted their focus away from condemnation of money to the personal quality of contentment. \\"For my ditties and my sleep no million is needed\\" is the new final line that Krylov added to the scene where the cobbler returns his money to the tax-farmer. And in the restatement of the fable by Aubépine in Offenbach's operetta the new moral is drawn that \\"This teaches you to be content with less\\" (Scene 4). ==Proverbs== During the 18th-19th centuries, the term proverbe was being applied to moralised dramatic pieces of one act, which had become popular because they could be played without the need of a stage and allowed for improvisation.Mélanges Tirés D'Une Grande Bibliotheque: Manuel Des Châteaux, Ou Lettres Contenant des conseils pour former une Bibliotheque romanesque, pour diriger une Comédie de Société, & pour diversifier les plaisirs d'un Salon, Paris 1779, p.253 Le Savetier et le Financier was one such 'proverb' that, according to her memoirs, was acted in her dining room by Stéphanie Félicité, comtesse de Genlis and two of her friends in pre- revolutionary days.Memoirs of the Countess de Genlis, New York 1825, vol.1, pp.165-6 A typical script of this kind furnishes the proverb that serves as its moral. Contentement Passe Richesse by Claude-Louis-Michel de Sacy (1746–94), for example, appeared in 1778 and there the French proverb provides the cobbler with his final words as he confronts the financier and hands him back his money.Théâtre Classique Similarly, in Le Savetier et le Financier, one of the pieces in the Proverbes dramaticques (1823) of Théodore Leclercq (1777-1851), the cobbler becomes reconciled with his wife after returning the money and they repeat together \\"Better than wealth is content\\" at the end.Proverbes dramaticques, Paris 1823), Le Savetier et le Financier, pp.237-81 The proverb itself was common in La Fontaine's time and was recorded as such in a contemporary dictionary.Antoine Furetière, Dictionnaire universel, contenant généralement tous les mots François (1690), vol.3 It was first applied as the story's subtitle by Jean Philippe Valette (1699-1750) in his condensations of La Fontaine's fables to fit the tune of popular songs, published in 1746. There the final stanza sums up the moral of the story in the words “Money is no beatitude,/ Believing otherwise is wrong”.Recueil de fables choisies dans le goût de M. De La Fontaine sur de petits airs et vaudevilles connus, p.47 But while the fable was initially independent of the proverb, La Fontaine's work soon provided the French language with a popular expression alluding to it. Grégoire was the name given the singing cobbler in the fable, and Insouciant comme Grégoire (carefree as Gregory) was soon applied to those with a similar nature.Les types populaires de la littérature française, 1926, vol.1, p.57 ==References== Category:La Fontaine's Fables Category:French plays Category:Latin poetry Category:Proverbs Category:Literary duos Category:Fictional shoemakers Category:Fictional businesspeople ","title":"The Cobbler and the Financier"},{"id":"35946118","text":"Brett Spencer Garrard (born 21 August 1976) is a male British former field hockey player. ==Hockey career== Garrard competed in the 2000 Summer Olympics and in the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court case examining the constitutionality of a state tax deduction granted to taxpaying parents for school-related expenses, including expenses incurred from private secular and religious schools. The plaintiffs claimed that a Minnesota statute, allowing tax deductions for both public and private school expenses, had the effect of subsidizing religious instruction since parents who paid tuition to religious schools received a larger deduction than parents of public school students, who incurred no tuition expenses. In a 5-4 decision, the Court upheld the statute.. The majority affirmed that the benefit was religiously neutral because the deduction applied equally to sectarian and nonsectarian tuition and that the choice of religious or nonreligious instruction was made by individual parents, not the state. Also, aid was given to parents, not schools. The dissenting opinion argued that the tax deduction violated the US Constitution because it was an indirect government subsidy of religion, providing a financial incentive to parents to send their children to religious schools. ==Background== The First Amendment of the US Constitution prohibits laws advancing the establishment of any religion. Any government- sponsored religious instruction is thus barred. Prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court's reviews of First Amendment disputes were minimal because the court maintained jurisdiction to consider only challenges against laws passed at the federal level. Everson v. Board of Education (1947) was the first case decided by the Court to apply the Establishment Clause prohibition to state laws. The decision in Everson established two criteria to judge state legislation: the action must have a secular purpose, and that purpose must be the primary effect of the action. Following a 1971 decision by the Supreme Court, a third condition was incorporated. The resulting three-pronged test, called Lemon test, prescribes that for any governmental policy or legislation to satisfy the Establishment Clause, it must have a secular purpose, its primary effect must not the advancement or inhibition of religion, and it must not create an excessive entanglement between religion and government. In Mueller, the plaintiff claimed that the primary effect of the Minnesota law was the advancement of religion since most taxpayers who benefited from the legislation were parents paying their children's tuition to private religious schools. ==Majority opinion== Justice Rehnquist delivered the majority opinion, which affirmed the decisions of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit that the Minnesota statute (§ 290.09, subd. 22) was constitutional. The law allowed state taxpayers to a state income tax deduction for any expenses toward their children's school tuition, textbooks, and transportation. The deduction was limited to $500 per student in elementary school and $700 per student in middle school and high school. The statute excluded deducting any expenses for \\"instructional books and materials used in the teaching of religious tenets, doctrines or worship, the purpose of which is to inculcate such tenets, doctrines or worship.\\" The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in contending that the tax deduction provided financial assistance to religious schools and that to assure no deduction was made for textbooks containing religious teachings, the state became excessively entangled with religion. Rehnquist noted that the statute was facially neutral on religion and rejected the plaintiff's argument that its religious partiality was evidenced by the fact that 96% of the private schools in Minnesota were sectarian institutions. ==Dissenting opinion== Justice Marshall wrote the dissenting opinion, agreed to by three other justices. The tax credits were available to all parents, but, in practice, the chief benefit went to parents whose children attended parochial schools. \\"Parents who send their children to free public schools are simply ineligible to obtain the full benefit of the deduction except in the unlikely event that they buy $700 worth of pencils, notebooks, and bus rides for their children.\\" As the First Amendment was concerned, Marshall added, a tax credit did not differ from a direct grant to parents, which had already been found unconstitutional. ==Aftermath== Mueller v. Allen marked a turning point for the Establishment Clause, and for the next 20 years the Supreme Court ruled more favorably if governments fostered aid. The Court upheld benefits that were deemed to be religiously neutral and were extended to all equally, even if they were favorable to individuals in exercising their privately-held religious interests. The Court became disinclined to overturn laws that did not disqualify religiously based interests if the direct beneficiaries of the legislation in question were individuals, rather than religiously-affiliated institutions. Following Mueller, \\"private choice\\" was a key element extended to subsequent Establishment Clause court decisions over government sponsored school vouchers, the most significant one being Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002). While direct aid was funneled instead to religious schools, the Court focused instead on whether or not the policies at issue provided sufficient controls to ensure the assistance was not directed to religious instruction and that the policies did not lead to forbidden entanglements between the government and any religious institution. ==Related cases== * Everson v.

It is registered as a Category I heritage building with Heritage New Zealand. ==History== Entrance of Big School Even before the first settlers came out to Canterbury on the First Four Ships, James FitzGerald had designed what became known as Big School in 1850 back in England as part of the settlement planned by the Canterbury Association. The Canterbury Provincial Council, of which FitzGerald had been the first Superintendent (1853–1857), voted ₤1,000 for the construction of Big School. The building was constructed in 1863 and was the school's first stone building. It is the only building known to have been designed by FitzGerald. The building was remodelled in 1970 by Miles Warren, an old boy of the school. It is the oldest building in the school complex. It is the oldest educational building in New Zealand in continuous use. Until 1989, the building was still largely in its original condition, when it was extended towards the west by five gabled wings. Sir Miles was the architect again and he won awards for the extension. The view from the school's quadrangle remained the same. The building is used by the school as a library. ===Heritage registration=== The building was registered as a heritage building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust on 7 April 1983 with registration number 48 classified as A. With the change of the classification system, the building later became a Category I listing. ==Architecture== The design of the building is relatively simple. Prior to the 1989 extension, the plan was a rectangle. From the quadrangle, the viewer sees solid buttresses, rows of lancet windows and a steeply pitched roof. The roof pitch allowed for the heavy snow falls that the Canterbury Association wrongly expected in Canterbury. The pattern in the roof tiles is believed to have been added in 1896. While in use as a school, the interior was gloomy, according to a 21st century source, as the windows were whitewashed. ==See also== * List of historic places in Christchurch ==References== Category:NZHPT Category I listings in Canterbury, New Zealand Category:1863 in New Zealand Category:Libraries in Christchurch Category:Schools in Christchurch Category:1860s architecture in New Zealand ","title":"Christ's College Big School"},{"id":"35946538","text":"Navidad may refer to: * Nochebuena or Navidad, Christmas Eve in Spanish ==Places== * Navidad, Chile, a commune in Cardenal Caro Province, O'Higgins Region, Chile * Navidad Formation, a geological formation in Chile * La Navidad, a settlement in what is now Haiti * Barra de Navidad, town in the Mexican state of Jalisco * Navidad Lake, Bolivian lake * Navidad Bank, submerged bank in the Atlantic Ocean * Navidad River, coastal river in the U.S. state of Texas * Navidad mine, a large silver mine in Argentina ==People with the surname== * Patricia Navidad (born 1973), Mexican singer and actress ==Film== * Navidad, 2009 film by Sebastián Lelio ==Music== * Navidad, oratorio by Eduardo Sánchez de Fuentes * Navidad (Jaci Velasquez album) (2001), Spanish Christmas album by Jaci Velasquez * Navidad (Lara & Reyes album) (2000), album released by Lara & Reyes * Navidad (Rojo EP) (2006), Christmas music EP by the Mexican Christian rock band Rojo * Navidades, a 2006 album by Luis Miguel * \\"Navidad\\", a 1989 song by José Luis Perales ==Other uses== * Navidad virus, a mass-mailing worm program or virus ==See also== * Nativity (disambiguation) * Feliz Navidad (disambiguation) ","title":"Navidad"},{"id":"35946543","text":"Fedor Ivanovich Kalinin (1882–1920) was a Russian revolutionary and writer.

Born Andrew Arthur Pelletier in Pain Court, Ontario, the 6′ 1½″ Pelkey fought in the heavyweight division at a weight of between 206 and 210 lbs. He was one of the \\"White Hopes\\" of the time that African American Jack Johnson was the world heavyweight champion. The height of his pro career and its nadir happened simultaneously when on 24 May 1913, he met Luther McCarty at Tommy Burns's Arena in Calgary, Alberta for McCarty's World White Heavyweight title. Burns had been the world heavyweight champ who had lost his title to Jack Johnson, and the title had been created to crown a white heavyweight champ in light of the failures of successive White Hopes to wrest the title from Johnson. Gunboat Smith stands over a knocked-down Pelkey during a match on January 1, 1914 in San Francisco, California. Smith defeated Pelkey for the World White Heavyweight Championship. Approximately two minutes into the first round of the scheduled 10-round bout, the 210 lbs. Pekley K.O.-ed the 200 lbs. McCarty. Eight minutes later, McCarty was pronounced dead. Pelkey reportedly broke down and wept when told of McCarty's death. Tommy Burns's Arena burned down the following day, likely as a result of arson. A coroner's jury ruled that McCarty had died of a cerebral hemorrhage. The ruling held that he had not been killed by a blow delivered by Pelkey but that the hemorrhage likely was the result of a previous injury. Pelkey later claimed that his legal expenses linked to McCarty's death bankrupted him. Pelkey reportedly was never the same after killing McCarty. He lost the white heavyweight title to Gunboat Smith on New Year's Day 1914 at Coffroth's Arena in Daly City, California United States via a T.K.O. in the 15th round of the scheduled 20-round bout. When he retired in 1920, he had compiled an official career record of 22 wins (17 by K.O.) against 21 losses (having been K.O.-ed 16 times) and three draws. He also had 10 newspaper decisions: five wins, two losses and three draws. - ==References== Category:1884 births Category:1921 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Chatham-Kent Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:World white heavyweight boxing champions Category:Canadian male boxers Category:Boxing people from Ontario ","title":"Arthur Pelkey"},{"id":"35946596","text":"The West German Audio Book Library for the Blind (), abbreviated WBH, is a specialist library which produces and distributes audiobooks and periodicals for blind and partially sighted persons.

Actors from the municipal theater recorded the first audio books in an improvised studio lined with egg cartons. Because trams rattled past during the day, these first productions took place at night. Later, texts were recorded by trained speakers, processed by the library, then distributed to users by mail. Until the 1970s recordings were on tape reels, then later compact tape cassettes.Siegfried Volkert und François Van Menxel (eds.): Lesen fürs Hören in Münster: 50 Jahre Westdeutsche Blindenhörbücherei e.V. 1955 - 2005.

In 2009 the library's collection became exclusively digital as cassette tapes were no longer made available. Today about 24,500 titles from the classics, mystery, biographies, nonfiction, plays and popular novels are available to users. Thirty professional freelance speakers record 350 new titles annually in the library’s own studio, which are then digitally mastered and cataloged. The WBH is legally permitted to record any book published in Germany for free, including such popular titles as Harry Potter. The library loans audio books on CD at no charge, while audio magazines and newspapers are made available on a subscription basis.

(NCHM) was created by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), George W. Romney, pursuant to an Executive Order of President Richard Nixon in 1972. https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/finding-aids/fg-347-national-center- housing-management-white-house-central-files-subject-files/. The President took the action on the recommendation of a blue-ribbon task force of national housing leaders chaired by Carter L. Burgess, the then Chairman of the National Corporation of Housing Partnerships (Executive Order No. 11668). The task force was made up of 13 members chosen by the President. The task force recognized that the country was in the process of greatly expanding its inventory of affordable housing but lacked the cadre of professional managers needed to successfully operate that inventory. President Nixon tasked NCHM with the mission of establishing industry standards for management and developing the training and other resources necessary to help achieve those standards. NCHM was established as a private, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization – not a federal agency – so that it would be free from political influence and able to establish meaningful and objective industry standards. NCHM's first president was Samuel J. Simmons. He served from 1972 to 1981. Simmons was previously Assistant Secretary for Equal Opportunity of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Director of Field Operations for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. After leaving NCHM he became the President and Chief Executive Officer of the National Caucus and Center on Black Aged, Inc. NCHM's current president, Paul R. Votto, was appointed to the position in February 2018. NCHM carries out its mission in three primary ways: professional training, certification, and direct technical assistance to both public and private housing organizations. Certifications offered by NCHM include: Certified Occupancy Specialist, Tax Credit Specialist, Blended Occupancy Specialist, Certified Manager of Housing, Certified Manager of Senior Housing, Certified Manager of Maintenance, Certified Financial Specialist, Registered Housing Manager, Fair Housing Specialist, HOME Compliance Specialist, and Rural Housing Specialist. On March 19, 2019, NCHM launched the Veterans for Housing Initiative https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/veterans-for-housing- initiative-launched-by-national-center-for-housing-management-1028042329. The Initiative's mission is to recruit and train veterans of the US armed services for careers in housing management, with an emphasis on affordable housinghttps://www.veteransforhousing.org/. NCHM has pledged $1,000,000 in training and certification scholarships for veterans not currently employed in the housing industry. NCHM also is a financial contributor to the \\"Save the Soldiers Home\\" project on the grounds of the Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. https://www.savethesoldiershome.com/ When completed, the project will restore six historic buildings, some dating back to the 1860s, and create 101 supportive housing units for veterans and their families who are either homeless or at risk of being homeless. The Milwaukee Soldiers Home is one of the three original Soldiers Homes in the U.S. and was the result of one of the last pieces of legislation signed in 1865 by President Abraham Lincoln.https://urbanmilwaukee.com/pressrelease/nchm- donates-100000-to-save-the-soldiers-home-project//ref> == References  External links == * Official website Category:Housing organizations in the United States Category:Social welfare charities based in the United States Category:Organizations established in 1972 ","title":"National Center for Housing Management"},{"id":"35946645","text":"Leptostylus transversus is a species of longhorn beetles of the subfamily Lamiinae.

He won the Coventry Stakes and the National Stakes as a two-year-old in 2011. In May 2012 he won the Irish 2000 Guineas. ==Background== Power is a \\"big, powerful\\" bay horse with a white star. He was sired by the European Champion Sprinter Oasis Dream out of the mare Frappe. Frappe also produced the Ribblesdale Stakes winner Thakafaat and was a half sister of the 2000 Guineas winner Footstepsinthesand. Power was acquired by the Coolmore organisation and sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. ==Racing career2011: two-year-old season=== Power began his racing career by winning a six furlong maiden race at the Curragh in early May and then won the Listed Marble Hill Stakes at the same venue three weeks later. In the latter race, he got the better of Tough As Nails to win by a short head.https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/racing/tough-as-nails-has-six- appeal-28629808.html In June Power was sent to England to contest the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot for which he started the 4/1 favourite in a field of twenty-three runners. Ridden by Ryan Moore, he was towards the back of the field before making progress to take the lead inside the final furlong to win by a neck from Roman Soldier. In August, Power returned to Ireland and started 7/4 favourite for the Group One Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh. He took the lead two furlongs from the finish but was overtaken in the last fifty yards by the filly La Collina who produced a \\"devastating turn of foot\\" to win by a neck. A month later, Power started second favourite for the National Stakes over seven furlongs. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan, he tracked the leaders before taking the lead inside the final furlong and held the late challenge of the favourite Dragon Pulse to win by half a length. After the race, Heffernan called him a tough, strong and genuine colt. On his final appearance of the season, Power started 15/8 favourite for the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket. He \\"kept on well\\" in the last furlong to finish second, beaten half a length by his fellow Irish challenger Parish Hall. ===2012: three-year-old season=== On his first appearance of 2012, Power was sent to Newmarket for the 2000 Guineas in which he started second favourite behind his stable companion Camelot. He made no impact in the race and was eased in the closing stages to finish seventeenth of the eighteen runners behind Camelot. Three weeks after his run at Newmarket, Power started at odds of 5/1 in the Irish 2000 Guineas. He took the lead inside the final furlong to win by a length from Foxtrot Romeo. He was ridden in the race by his trainer's son Joseph O'Brien, who described Power as \\"a classy horse\\" with \\"plenty of speed\\". Aidan O'Brien was so delighted by the result that he was unaware until told by journalists that his other runners had finished third and fourth. On 19 June, Power started favourite for the St. James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot, but was never in contention in a rough race and finished unplaced behind Most Improved. Power sustained an injury in the Ascot race from which he never fully recovered. In October it was announced that he would be retired to the Coolmore Stud.http://www.attheraces.com/article.aspx?hlid=528523&lid;=&raceid;=&title;=Power+retired+to+stud&ref;=atrPA+Racing+Feed&nav;=⊂=&day;=Fri ==Stud career== After standing for five seasons at Coolmore Stud in Ireland, Power was sold to Cambridge Stud in New Zealand where he was the leading first-season sire during the 2016-17 season.

Miller was partly of French heritage). At age 5, William Miller arrived in Victoria, Australia with his family. From 1862 to 1869, Miller worked for the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company as station-master and telegraph instructor. Miller became proprietor of the Melbourne Gymnasium, and instructor to some the leading Melbourne schools. Miller won the Australian broadsword championship in 1872. In the US from 1874 to 1880 he defeated cosmopolitan champions in boxing and wrestling, out of 72 matches, he had 55 wins and 11 draws. In 1879 he defeated Duncan Ross walking over 102 miles (164 km) in 24 hours and drew with the champion weight-lifter Richard Pennell, both lifting 1550 lbs. (703 kg) of iron. == Australian heavyweight champion, 1883 == He met Larry Foley, who came out of boxing retirement to fight a gloved battle using the newer and somewhat safer Marquess of Queensberry Rules against him in Sydney, New South Wales on 28 May 1883 for the championship of Australia. Due to Miller's weight of around 190, the bout was a heavyweight championship. Unofficially declared a draw, the forty round bout and the £500 purse were given to Miller on May 29 when Foley conceded he had lost the fight. Miller was a considerably larger and more muscular man than Foley, with nearly a forty-pound advantage in weight to Foley's light middleweight class of around 150 pounds. The contest lasted three hours and would have been called far earlier if held today, as Foley took a great deal of punishment. Though Foley had a lead in the first hour, the tide turned and Miller's strong and constant left to Foley's face began to take its toll. In the 37th and 40th rounds, a right by Miller knocked Foley to the mat. Around the 40th round, spectators climbed into the ring, and the police were forced to stop the fight, with the referee postponing the ruling or calling a temporary draw til the following day.Weights of boxers and fight coverage in \\"The Intercolonial Glove Contest\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, pg. 8, 29 May 1883 Miller invited the famous wrestler Clarence Whistler to tour in Australia. Whistler defeated Miller in September 1885. During the tour, Whistler died. There has been various explanations for his death. Miller was a pallbearer at Whistler's funeral. In 1895 Miller published Health, Exercise and Amusement in Melbourne. In 1903 Miller returned to the US and became manager of the San Francisco Athletic Club and later athletic instructor with the New York police. Miller lived in Baltimore from 1917 and died there on 11 March 1939.

Rather than the long tube-like drones of most bagpipes, shuttle pipes use a shuttle drone, a cylindrical chamber enclosing a series of drone tubes, each terminating in a slot covered by a sliding \\"shuttle\\" which can be adjusted to lengthen or shorten the distance traveled by air moving through the tube, thus flattening or sharpening the pitch of the note produced.Christopher Bayley: Shuttle Pipes, http://www.bagpipeworld.co.uk/country/britain/shuttle.html, accessed May 26, 2012.Jerry Finegan: Scottish Smallpipes & Shuttle Pipes, http://www.raleighbagpiper.com/Smallpipes.aspx, last updated 2011. Like other bagpipes, shuttle pipes have a chanter which is used to play the melody. Some modern versions use Great Highland Bagpipe fingering so that Highland bagpipers can easily play it.George O. Barton, Pipe Master: Shuttle Pipes History, http://www.celticpiper.com/pipes/shuttle.html, accessed May 26, 2012. The bag of the modern shuttle pipe is either mouth-inflated through a blowpipe (or blowstick), or bellows-inflated. Shuttle pipes appeared during the latter half of the 16th century, possibly in France, influenced by the Rackett, and were popular in the 17th and 18th centuries. The original form is generally believed to have been bellows-blown—a drawing of a set of bellows-blown shuttle pipes appears in a 1618 Syntagma Musicum (Treatise of Music) by composer and music theorist Michael Praetorius (1571–1621), and a bellows- blown French form, the musette de cour, is portrayed by Flemish baroque artist Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599–1641) in his early 1630s painting Portrait of François Langlois.The National Gallery, Trafalgar Square, London: Portrait of François Langlois, http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/anthony-van- dyck-portrait-of-francois-langlois, accessed May 26, 2012. The musette de cour was reputedly played by King Louis XIV of France (1638–1715). Interest in the shuttle pipes waned in the 19th century, and they were nearly forgotten by the early 20th century, but they were rediscovered in the 1980s, and they now fill a niche in popular and traditional music for a bagpipes sound where highland pipes would be overwhelming.

The son of a Plymouth surgeon, Yonge went to sea with the Royal Navy as an apprentice surgeon as a young boy. Later he went on several voyages with the Newfoundland fishing fleets. In his twenties he set up in practice in Plymouth and over the years became prosperous. Yonge was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1702 and Mayor of Plymouth for 1694–95. He wrote medical textbooks and a journal of his life. == Background == Little is known of the forebears of James Yonge. His father John was a surgeon in the Plymouth area, of unclear origins of his father are not clear. He may have come from Ireland and been part of the Protestant ascendancy; Yonge refers in his JournalJournal of James Yonge - Plymouth and West Devon Record Office to visiting his grandmother in Cork. The accounts in Burke's Landed Gentry, that he was a descendant of the Yonges of Colyton in Devon, are unfounded. His mother Joanna Blackaller (1618–1700) was the daughter of Nicholas Blackaller of Dartmouth, Devon, England. The Blackallers were merchants. His parents were married in St Savours, Dartmouth in September 1640.Devon Parish Registers Devon Record Office Exeter By the time Yonge was born, his parents were living in Plymouth, England. He was baptised in the Parish Church of St Andrew, Plymouth, England on 11 March 1647. Yonge was the fifth of seven children, all of whom survived at least to early adulthood. There is a family story of a quarrel with his brother Nathaniel, who unlike Yonge was not a royalist. There is evidence that they did not get on in Yonge's Journal. == Life at sea == In 1658 Yonge's father had him articled as an apprentice at the age of ten to Silvester Richmond of Liverpool, the surgeon on the Navy vessel . He was next was appointed surgeon's mate to , which formed part of Lord Sandwich's fleet in the Downs and in 1660, aged 13, he sailed on the Montague which was involved in an ineffectual bombardment of Algiers in the following year. He was released from his apprenticeship, in May 1662, by his master's retirement. He was then an assistant at Wapping, to an apothecary named Clarke. There he apparently picked up practical knowledge of the making up of medicines. Yonge returned to Plymouth in September 1662 and was then unwillingly bound to his own father for another seven years. This action by his father rankled with him all his life. He wrote \\"My elder brother was maintained like a prince, I clad with old turned cloaths, and not one penny in my pocket, he was hard as a master.\\" Yonge soon was at sea again. During this period he undertook several voyages with the Newfoundland fisheries. The first was in May 1663 when aged 16, he took passage in the ship Reformation. Yonge spent time on land and used to walk between settlements, making sketches and observations on the industry.James Yonge - Some considerations touching the debate etc. concerning the Newfoundland Trade 1670 In January 1666, during the Second Dutch War, his ship, the Bonaventure was captured by the Dutch and he was shackled together with other prisoners, for fifty one days. (The biography of the Victorian writer Charlotte Yonge by Christabel ColeridgeCharlotte Mary Yonge by Christabel Coleridge Macmillan 1903 refers to Yonge being a galley slave of the Moors, possibly conflating the time he was a Dutch prisoner with the fact that he did serve off Algiers whilst in the Navy.) In September 1666 he was exchanged for a relative of the secretary of the Dutch Admiralty, who was a prisoner at Harwich. In February 1668, Yonge made what was to be his final voyage, to Newfoundland in the Marigold of Plymouth. He describes his arrival: > \\"Coming up with the ice we find no passage, stand through it and in two > hours got on the inside of it ...but not without knocking our ship. find > ourselves the first ship in the land and Admiral of St Johns. God be praised > for this good landfall and good place! == The medical profession == Yonge returned to Plymouth on 29 September 1670, and established himself in practice, aged 25. He was then appointed surgeon at the Naval Hospital in Plymouth, established following the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1672. In 1674, Thomas Pearse, the Surgeon-General of the Navy, made Yonge his deputy. In 1692, following his appointment as surgeon to the new dock at Hamoaze, Plymouth, Yonge had to go to London. Whilst there he attended Edward Tyson's anatomical lectures at Surgeons Hall. In 1702, in London again, he was persuaded to sit the examination of the College of Physicians, as an Extra-Licentiate. In his journal Yonge states there was no need as he did not intend to practice in practice in London or the immediate environs as he already had licence from the Bishop (presumably the Bishop of Exeter) but that College persuaded him that it would give him added status. Yonge corresponded with Sir Hans Sloane. In London he associated with Francis Atterbury, Charles Bernard, Edward Browne and Walter Charleton as well as Tyson. He was also a frequent visitor to Oxford, where he catalogued the Ashmolean Museum and was entertained at the University. Yonge exposed the plagiarism of John Browne. Browne's Compleat Treatise of the Muscles appeared in a second edition in 1683. Yonge then pointed out that it put together text from the Muskotomia of William Molins with illustrations from the Tabula anatomicae of Giulio Casserius. == Civic affairs == By the 1670s Yonge had become a person of some importance, and was called to fill a succession of civic and professional offices in Plymouth, whose charter had been re-granted by Charles II. In 1679 he was elected a member for life of the Common Council of the Borough of Plymouth. In 1682 he was appointed a churchwarden at St Andrew's. In 1694 he became alderman and mayor of Plymouth. He gives in Plymouth MemoirsPlymouth Memoirs of Dr James Yonge published by the Plymouth Institution in 1951 this account of his mayoralty in 1694–5. > Dec. the Lord Cutts came to town, Lay at my house. 3 Regiments quartered in > town, to be Embarked for the W.

His brother Nathaniel who was also involved in the politics of the town. On his death Yonge wrote in the Plymouth Memoir: > \\"he was a zealot in this new model and I believe the disappointment they met > [four Whig magistrates had just died and the two Whig Members of parliament > for Plymouth had been replaced by Tories] and the odium they contracted help > to bring ye asthma on him\\" In his Plymouth Memoirs he gives short biographies of the mayors in his time, containing \\"ye memorable occurrences in their respective yeares\\". For example: > \\"Rob Brown Mayor 1711 Was chosen the usual day. A tool, & a fool, dyed soon > after, and was succeed by B. Berry, who served the rest of the yeare: and > having no house in town, Lodged and Kept the Mayoralty at an house that was > comon for quarting strangers, & selling punch, Ale, to the great scandal of > the office...but they stuck at nothing, - to regard neither the credit, or > welfare of the town, filled up ye benches with men that were of mean, > Scandalous, --- as if they had been sworn to choos the worst -- and did many > things contrary to the constitution, & custom of the Burrough, chose a Mayor > that did not Inhabit, filled the Benches with Lawyers.\\" == Naval surgeon == He held the appointment as surgeon to the Devonport dockyard from 1692 to April 1701. Towards the end of his tenure, at the end of the 17th Century a new residential terrace was constructed at the dockyard for the senior officers. Most of the terrace was destroyed in World War II but Yonge's part survives. He wrote in his Journal: > \\"in May this year I got a warrant to be Surgeon of the Navy and yard at > Plymouth, Capt. Hen. Greenhill Commander, John Addis, clerk of the chequer, > Mr. Stollard master attendant, Mr. Watt master builder, Mr. Gazby store > keeper, Mr. Rob.

We all very fine houses, stables, gardens, &c.;, > but did not live easy under the Commander, who was a proud, morose man.\\" Yonge's service for the Navy ended on an unhappy note in 1701. He wrote in his Journal: > 1701\\\\. The beginning of this year, April 25, I was displaced from the dock > by the false accusation of Comr St Lo. He had attempted it twice before, but > then the Lords of Admiralty made enquiry into the matter and found me > innocent but notwithstanding that and a promise they made not to hearken any > more to him, they did on this third wrong information put me out without > notice or hearing and this injustice he got by quitting Weymouth to Col > Churchill’s brother. == Financial rewards == In his Journal he refers to 12s. as the fee for a twenty-mile visit, another £1, and, for an outside visit of two days' duration, £1 l0s. Bleeding a lady in bed cost 10s., as against 2h, 6d. for a man. A post mortem 3s. 4d.' During the late 17th century he seems to have been very busy. He was travelling all over Devon and Cornwall. He recites his earnings for one year that he got £40 for 12 days treatment for a man run through with a blade - a lady at Butshead that he often had to visit £40 a year - tapping Mr Pake 25 guineas [£26.25] etc. - curing 9 fistulas for which he got between £30 and £70 each - treating an ulcer in the bladder for four years £200 etc. He earned from 25 to 100 guineas for a single operation and boasted that he obtained £120 in Ye one year for treating sailors for the pox (syphilis) in the naval hospital at Plymouth. One of the last commissions that he refers to in his journal is the embalming of the body in preparation for his lying in state in London, of Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell who drowned off the Scilly Isles in one of the worst ever peacetime disasters of the Royal Navy. For this he was paid £50. Once he had made his name his role was perhaps equivalent to that of the consultant or society doctor for Yonge was not however average. He amassed a considerable fortune during his life through hard work and one suspects hard nosed commercial brain. A document in the Plymouth and West Devon Record OfficePlymouth and West Devon Record Office PWDRO 107/680 shows that his assets and income in 1718 amounted to £21,000. A remarkable sum bearing in mind it had nearly all come from the results of his medical practice. It is very difficult to compare monetary value of the past with today but by way of an example taking a compilation from several sources, in 1718 an average farm labourer would have earned £18 a year and an attorney £120. It was this money which established the family in society for generations to come. ==Death== Yonge died on 25 July 1721 and was buried in the Church of St Andrew, Plymouth. A memorial was erected to him, apparently destroyed during the Second World War when the church was badly damaged. An old church guideJewers, Arthur J. Copies of inscriptions; drawings of coats of armour in the churches of St. Andrews and Charles, Plymouth. quotes it: > \\"Here underneath lyeth buried the body of James Yonge physitian. Fellow of > the Royal Society. He was once mayor of his native town and dyeth the 25th > day of July 1721 in the 76th year of his age.\\" == Publications == Yonge's best known work is his Journal, published in 1963 by Frederick Noël Lawrence Poynter, as The Journal of James Yonge, Plymouth Surgeon. It gives a complete account of his life from the age of ten until the age of 61. It is considered to be the most important diary of the 17th century after those of Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn. In it Yonge mentioned famous people he had seen in his travels, dropping names and in some cases giving a frank. Sebastian King of Portugal a fool and a sot George Duke of Buckingham a very handsome and accomplished person a wit and a debaucheer In 1678 Yonge visited London with John Sparke, the member of Parliament for Plymouth, and whilst there met a number of members of the Royal Society. In consequence he wrote Currus Triumphalis de Terebintho. It describes how he used turpentine to arrest a haemorrhage, describes the flap operation in amputation and shows that he was familiar with tourniquets. On 3 November 1702 Yonge was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and made contributions to the Philosophical Transactions. He published there on subjects as diverse as \\"on a bullet in the trachea, on two huge gallstones and on intestinal concretion \\". In correspondence with Charles Goodall he noted the application of lemon juice as good for the gums in cases of scurvy.James Lind. A treatise on the scurvy. Second edition. London: printed for A. Millar, 1757. British library 002172273 Yonge published in 1685 Medicaster Medicatus, criticizing John Browne and William Salmon, and in 1699 Sidrophel Vapulans: or, The Quack-Astrologer tossed in a blanket, again criticizing William Salmon. Salmon was a well known empiric. Yonge returned to attack him at the prompting of Charles Goodall, who had quarrelled with Richard Boulton, an ally of Salmon, over comments made about Charles Leigh. In Sidrophel Vapulans,Sidrophel Vapulans or the Quack Astrologer - James Yonge 1698 British Library 004002051 he wrote on the large number of unqualified people practicing medicine. > \\"It is therefore a great wonder that in this age of regulation and amendment > nothing is done to rectify the notorious abuses and secure us from the > mischief done by those men who without skill or authority under he pretence > of restoring and preserving do destroy men's lives and estates and more > especially at such a time when the Nation is in need of both for its defence > and preservation.\\" \\"Why then should impudent ignorant quack and empirics > (smiths weavers cobblers draymen women etc) boldly and unaccountably take > upon them great cures and things of great difficulty in which they partly > use sorcery, witchcraft, [cause] grievous hurt damage and destruction of > many of the Kings liege people, most especially of them that can not discern > the uncunning from the comic cunning.\\" Yonge did not get everything right. Also in Sidrophel Vapulans he wrote: > How absurd it is to affirm that a bright and dark moon shall have the same > effect, that a body fourteen times less than the Earth and at such a great > distance from it shall press the ocean to such an extent and while its in > the like situation force it to retire…. So the cause of the motion seems as > that of the heart only known to him that made it. Most of Yonge's published works were on surgical procedures. He was probably the first person to perform a successful brain operation in England. Because few believed him he published in 1682 an account entitled \\"Wounds of the Braine Proved Curable\\", a treatise based on several of his own cases. He left details of an early trepanning operation that he performed on a man who \\"by a prodigious wound in the forehead lost as much brain as the shell of a pullets egg can contain and was cured in Plimmouth by J. Y. 1686\\". Yonge also published Several Evidences to prove that Eikon Basilike was written by Charles I. Modern research however indicates that the work was in fact by John Gauden. == Family == Yonge married on 28 March 1671 Jane, daughter of Thomas Crampporne of Buckland Monachorum in Devon. By her he had two sons, the eldest of whom predeceased him or and six daughters but only one, Johanna, survived to adulthood to have a family of her own. His brother Samuel wrote a work entitled \\"A Censure of Three Scandalous pamphlets,A Censure of Three Scandalous pamphlets – A defence of Dr Crisp against the charge of Mr Edward Thomas British Library 4152.aa.5 and in it he commented on Yonge: > “I am sorry to say my Prefacer [Yonge] a great friend to all dissenters, > went to all their meetings, contributions etc till he was forced to go to > sacrament to get the hospital at Plymouth and then he baulked at complying > and was dragged to the Lords table and then became one of the greatest > enemies they had.” Yonge's eldest son James Yonge (1679–1718) married Mary Upton, daughter and heir of John Upton of Puslinch, Newton Ferrers, Devon. Yonge made the marriage possible, paying off Upton debts and mortgages and building of a new Puslinch House which cost a reputed £10,000. The house of Puslinch remains in the ownership of the Yonge family. ==NotesExternal links== * * The Yonge Family of Puslinch Devon.

Fundamentally in a market game, markets work in a strategic way that does not (directly) involve price but can indirectly influence it. The key ingredients to modelling market games are the definition of trading posts (or markets), and their price formation mechanisms as a function of the actions of players. A leading example is the Lloyd Shapley and Martin Shubik Shapley, L., Shubik, M., 1977. Trade using one commodity as a means of payment. Journal of Political Economy 85, 937–968, https://doi.org/10.1086/260616. trading post game.Gaël Giraud, Strategic market games: an introduction, Journal of Mathematical Economics, Volume 39, Issue 5, 2003, Pages 355-375, ISSN 0304-4068, https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0304-4068(03)00049-1. Shapley-Shubik use a numeraire and trading posts for goods. The relative price of each good in terms of the numeraire is determined as the ratio of the amount of the numeraire brought at each post, to the quantity of goods offered for sale at that post. In this way, every agent is allocated goods in proportion to his bids, so that posts always clear. Pradeep Dubey and John Geanakoplos show that such a game can be a strategic foundation of the Walras equilibrium. A key ingredient of such approaches is to have very large numbers of players, such that for each player the action appears to him as a linear constraint that he cannot influence. ==References == Category:Business models Category:Game theory game classes ","title":"Market game"},{"id":"35946923","text":"The Portas Review was carried out in 2011 by retail expert and television personality Mary Portas into issues affecting the retail sector in the United Kingdom, and particularly high streets.

The government made £1.2m available to fund the schemes. == Background == In May 2011 it was announced that Mary Portas was to carry out a review of many of England's high streets for the Department for Business. The objective being to propose ideas for how the decline of town centres could be halted. In December 2011 the government published Portas's report. The report recommended that town centres should be run like businesses, that many regulations should be scrapped and rules relaxed and that free car-parking should be made available to attract shoppers. The competition had 371 bids, 13 towns have so far been selected.Portas Pilots In 2017, research conducted by the Local Data Company (LDC) for BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme found that there had been a net loss of 969 retail units in the 12 towns. This equated to a drop of 17% over the five years. Interviewed, Portas said the decline in retail units was in line with her earlier predications for the future of the high street in general. She described the Portas pilot scheme as \\"a weighted PR campaign which looked like 'Hey, we're doing something' and I hoped it might kick start something – but it didn't\\" Small business owners in the pilot areas were interviewed as saying the scheme had “its own agenda” and “little focus on retail”.

Inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's tale The Story of a Mother, it depicts a Grim Reaper figure, in a dynamic pose, carrying a scythe, striding over a mother with a dead child crouching on the ground. The original plaster model is in the holdings of the Danish National Gallery while two bronze castings are located outside St. Peter's Church in Copenhagen and Vejen Art Museum. ==History== Hansen Jacobsen created the original plaster model in 1892, shortly after he had settled in Paris where he lived until 1901. His newly wedded wife Gabriela served as model for the mother crouching on the ground. The literary inspiration for the work was Hans Christian Andersen's tale The Story of a Mother. When the sculpture was exhibited at Charlottenborg in 1894, the catalogue contained a slightly modified version of the last sentence of the tale: \\"And she lowered her head into her lap. And Death took her child into the Unknown Lands\\". The model was first exhibited at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris where it was well received. The next year it was exhibited at Charlottenborg and in 1899 Hansen Jacobsen gave the model to the Danish National Gallery. ==Casts== The cast at St. Peter's graveyard After his return to Denmark in 1901, Hansen Jacobsen received a commission from Carl Jacobsen's Albertina Foundation for a bronze cast which was installed in front of Church of the Holy Ghost in Copenhagen. In 1966 it had to be moved because the ward found it \\"profoundly depressing\\" and it was instead placed outside St. Peter's Church. Another cast was later placed outside Vejen Art Museum which had been opened to house his oeuvre. ==Description== The portrayal of Death as the Grim Reaper was frequently seen in other artworks of the time, such as in paintings by Jean- François Millet and the Danish painter L.

Ely remarked that he had wanted to buy such a publication for the previous three years due to the belief that \\"small newspapers – especially those who know how to embrace their community and provide relevant news and local information – have great futures.\\" === 2012 presidential campaign === Campaign ad run by Ely in the New Hampshire Union Leader In 2011, Ely grew concerned about the economy and national debt. Because he was \\"tired of bitching and moaning\\", he opened a campaign website titled \\"workmorekeepless.com\\" and filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for president as a Democrat, reasoning that \\"if [Congresswoman] Michele Bachmann can run for president, I can, too.\\" On his website, he expressed support for spending cuts and higher taxes and promoted a \\"jobs bank\\" to allow businesses to create new positions and hire new employees, who would then receive a minimum wage salary from the government in lieu of unemployment benefits. He lists \\"two dozen good reasons not to vote for me\\" on the site, and refers to himself as a \\"jerk\\", explaining that he has such an attitude \\"because I am angry, scared and fed up with what passes for political discourse and leadership in this country.\\" In a later interview with Wikinews, Ely remarked that the intent of the website was to combine \\"humor, some outrageousness and a cogent 'platform' [to] make me a safe protest vote.\\" Ely filed for the January 2012 New Hampshire Democratic primary in 2011. To spread his message, he bought space in local newspapers and sent out 145,000 mailers to homes throughout New Hampshire, asking, \\"Are you pissed-off enough to vote for a jerk?\\" For the primary, he told The Portsmouth Herald that he had spent $200,000 of his own money, including the $1,000 filing fee. Among the field of 14 candidates on the ballot, Ely finished seventh with 287 votes for 0.47 percent of the total. In additional primaries, his numbers steadily improved. At the March 6 Oklahoma primary, for which he paid $2,500 to appear, he finished in fifth place with 5,318 votes for 4.72 percent. At the March 24 Louisiana primary, whose filing fee was $1,125, he came in third, behind only Obama and attorney John Wolfe, Jr., and won 9,897 votes for 6.57 percent. After this, his strongest showing, Ely sent out a letter, later published by Politico, which explained that in Louisiana without buying any advertisements or campaigning, he was able to win 120 voting precincts and out-paced President Obama in 457 precincts. He speculated that \\"most [of the votes] came from those who concluded 'I’ve never heard of this guy so he can’t be any worse than the rest of these clowns.' It seems a strange indictment of our political establishment that obscurity becomes an asset.\\" After prison inmate Keith Judd won 41 percent against President Obama in the West Virginia Democratic primary, Ely was featured in a Politico article as \\"an aspiring Keith Judd\\". He paid $2,500 to appear on the May 29 Texas primary ballot, and was listed alongside Obama, Wolfe, and historian Darcy Richardson. A contributor to The Hays Free Press of Hays County, Texas speculated that some Texas Democrats may vote for Ely, \\"on the hopes he is kin to Joe Ely, who belts out good songs on the radio.\\" Ely won about 2.4 percent of the vote in Texas and received a plurality in King and Loving counties. === 2020 campaign === In November of 2019, Ely got on the ballot in several states for the 2020 presidential primary, running as a Republican. In the 2020 New Hampshire Republican primary, Ely received 65 total votes. == Personal life == In 1983, Ely married freelance illustrator Alice Fairchild Moulton, and both assumed the last name Moulton-Ely. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Campaign website * FEC filing Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:American investment bankers Category:American newspaper publishers (people) Category:Businesspeople from Illinois Category:Illinois Democrats Category:Candidates in the 2012 United States presidential election Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Yale University alumni ","title":"Bob Ely"},{"id":"35947196","text":"Furona Island is a small island off the coast of Santa Isabel Island in the Solomon Islands.

In the 1830s, the population of the combined parishes had risen to about 20,000 people, so a split became necessary. The priest and his curate, the brothers Anthony and Patrick McGuane, built two identical church buildings in Milltown Malbay and Mullagh. The Night of the Big Wind prevented completion of the church in Mullagh. The planned tower and spire were never built. When Fr. Anthony McGuane died in 1839, his brother Fr. Patrick became the first parish priest of Kilfarboy. Their cousin, Fr. Edmund Barry, became the first parish priest of Kilmurry Ibrickane. Fr. Thomas Moloney, then curate at Kilmurry Ibrickane, was a supporter of the Young Ireland movement.

It is found in the Western Pacific Ocean. ==Description== Pseudanthias ventralis has males which are metallic purple with a yellow head and a yellow tinge on the back just below the dorsal fin, although sometimes this is masked by heavy purple spotting. The populations from the southern quadrant of their range normally has distinct and circular purple spots in this part of the back. The dorsal fin is red on the spiny part and hyaline or yellowish on the soft-rayed part. The caudal fin is mostly clear and the only markings are two vertical purple lines. The anal fin is clear with an obvious purple line demarcating a are of deeper colouration which contains the anal fin spines and the first soft rays fin. The females are a similar metallic purple colour as the males, but do not have the dame markings. They do have a yellow dorsal fin, the colour just extending on to a small area of the back as far as the caudal peduncle. They also have a red arcing stripe which separates the yellow and purple on the back near the tail. Specimens from other geographical regions show differences in colouration to the above which represents the population from the type locality. The dorsal fin has 10 spines and 17 soft rays whil the anal fin has 3 spines and 8 soft rays. This species attains a maximum total length of . ==Distribution== Pseudanthias ventralis is found in the Western Pacific from southern Japan to the Marshall Islands, the Coral Sea, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and the Great Barrier Reef and in French Polynesia, Pitcairn Island and the Cook Islands. ==Habitat and biology== Pseudanthias ventralis is associated with coral reefs with a depth range of . It is a secretive species which is normally recorded from caves or beneath ledges but have also been reported over coral rubble along steep drop-offs or the sides of channels. They leave the shelter of caves and overhangs to feed on zooplankton such as copepods. It also feeds on larvae of crustaceans and fish eggs. ==Taxonomy== Pseudanthis ventralis was first formally described by John E. Randall as Anthias ventralis in 1979 with the type locality given as Gannet Ridge near Pitcairn Island.

It was founded in 1872 and is now part of the Priory Group, which was acquired in 2011 by an American private equity firm, Advent International. The Priory has an international reputation and, because of the number of celebrities that have sought treatment there, widespread coverage in the press. The hospital treats mild to moderate mental health issues, such as stress and anxiety, through outpatient treatments such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as well as in-patient care for more severe psychiatric illness such as depression, psychotic illness, addictions or eating disorders. It has residential facilities for 107 patients. ==History== American singer and actor Paul Robeson, an early celebrity patient of the Priory The Priory operates from a Grade II listed building located in Roehampton in south-west London. Originally a private home, it was built in 1811 in the Gothic revival style. The Priory has been variously described in the press as a \\"white Gothic mansion\\", \\"Strawberry Hill Gothic\\", and \\"a white- painted fantasy of Gothic spikes and battlements\\". The building was converted from a private home into a hospital in 1872 by William Wood, one of the first modern psychiatrists. It is London's longest established private psychiatric hospital. Early celebrity patients included, in the 1880s, the wife of the Victorian politician Jabez Balfour, and, in the 1960s, the American singer Paul Robeson. In 1980 the hospital was acquired by an American healthcare company, and became the first clinic in what was to become the Priory Group. The Priory subsequently benefited from two developments in the 1980s. Firstly, celebrities began seeking treatment at the hospital, attracted not only by clinical excellence, but also by location and, according to one press report, \\"a version, much-updated, of the smartest 19th century spa experience\\". Secondly, the National Health Service was forced to close down some of its mental health hospitals and instead began referring patients to the Priory. By the early 1990s, almost half the Priory Group's patients were funded by the UK government. The Priory has also been subject to adverse comment in recent years. The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy has criticised the hospital for offering treatment for \\"lifestyle addictions\\", such as compulsive texting, and because patients were paying for \\"the kudos attached to the clinic's name\\" (although it acknowledged the hospital provided a first-class service). The Priory is regulated by the UK's Care Quality Commission and is registered with the commission to provide medical treatment including the treatment of patients detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. In 2011, the Commission inspected the Priory and found that it \\"was not meeting one or more essential standards. Improvements are needed.\\" The commission has also stated that they have required the Priory to undertake improvements in four out of the five areas which they reviewed: treating people with respect and involving them in their care; providing care, treatment and support that meets people's needs; staffing; and quality and suitability of management. In the remaining fifth area, caring for people safely and protecting them from harm, the Commission considered that all standards were met and no improvements were required. It was reported in 2010 that the Priory had undergone a £3 million refurbishment to restore it to its original 1811 condition. Rooms were reportedly refurnished and repainted in colours intended to promote \\"well-being\\". Ultimate ownership of the Priory has passed through several hands since the 1980s and, in 2011, the Priory Group was sold to Advent International, an American private equity firm, by the then owner the Royal Bank of Scotland. ==Facilities== Rock guitarist Eric Clapton, former patient of the Priory The Priory is the flagship hospital of the Priory Group and is best known for treating celebrities particularly for drug addiction. It has been described as the British equivalent of the Betty Ford Clinic in terms of its popular image. ===Treatment programmes=== The hospital provides outpatient and day patient care for people suffering from mild to moderate mental health issues and in-patient care for more severe psychiatric illness such as depression, psychotic illness or eating disorders. Its healthcare services cover the following: *General psychiatry including depression, anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorders, schizophrenia and other acute psychiatric illnesses. *Addiction treatment programme for addictions relating to alcohol, drugs, gambling, relationships and shopping *Eating disorder unit and day care services with programmes for anorexia, bulimia, binge eating and other conditions related to eating disorders. *Child and adolescent mental health service for ages 12 to 18. Treatments offered reportedly include cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy, EMDR (eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing), Neuro- linguistic Programming (NLP) equine assisted psychotherapy, psychodrama, and art and movement therapy. ECT (Electro-convulsive therapy) is also used, with about 500 to 600 treatments per year. The other facilities include a fully equipped gym with fitness instructor, t'ai chi, yoga, and aerobics classes, swimming, aromatherapy and shiatsu massage. It has residential facilities for 107 patients who stay in individual rooms with en-suite bathrooms; fees are said to be in excess of £2,500 per week. It has been reported that the Priory has had contracts with the UK's Ministry of Defence to treat military personnel (including for PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder) and with the BBC to treat a number of its executives. ===Priory Lodge School=== In 2010, the hospital opened the Priory Lodge School in its grounds. The school specialises in caring for and educating children with autistic spectrum disorders, in particular Asperger’s Syndrome and associated learning difficulties and charges fees of £65,000 per year. In 2014 it was rated \\"Good\\" by Ofsted, the second-highest rating in a four-point scale. ==Celebrity patients== *Lily Allen *George Best *Susan Boyle *Antonio Carluccio *Tom Chaplin *Craig Charles *Eric Clapton *Graham Coxon *Pete Doherty *Johnny Depp *Richey Edwards *Michael Elphick *Paul Gascoigne *Jade Goody *Ricky Hatton *Justin Hawkins *Lady Isabella Hervey *Michael Johnson *John McGeogh *Kate Moss *Sinéad O'Connor *António Horta Osório *Ronnie O'Sullivan *Marti Pellow *Katie Price *Gail Porter *Paul Robeson *Ruby Wax *Robbie Williams *Amy Winehouse *Paula Yates ==See also== * List of hospitals in England * Grovelands Park, a Priory Hospital in Southgate, London ==ReferencesExternal links== *NHS online: the Priory Hospital, Roehampton *Priory Group: The Priory Hospital Roehampton Overview Category:1872 establishments in England Category:Addiction organisations in the United Kingdom Category:Drug and alcohol rehabilitation centers Category:Gothic Revival architecture in London Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Wandsworth Category:Grade II listed houses in London Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom Category:Hospitals established in 1872 Category:Hospitals in London Category:Private hospitals in the United Kingdom Category:Roehampton ","title":"Priory Hospital"},{"id":"35947375","text":"Diego Iori (born May 20, 1986) is an Italian professional ice hockey player who is currently playing for the HC Fassa of the Serie A.

The first round consisted of 34 heats and ante-post favourite Top Savings justified his odds by going fastest with a 28.40 win. Micks Mystic the Scottish Derby champion was a notable elimination. Top Savings was fastest again in round two on slower going recording 28.89 beating Larkhill Bullet. Farloe Verdict and Droopys Corleone remained unbeaten. Top Savings was denied a third successive fastest round time by stayer Maxie Rumble. The Prestige champion went ten spots faster in 28.79 sec. Droopys Corleone won again but Farloe Verdict lost his unbeaten record when finishing runner up to Top Savings with Larkhill Bullet in third. In the quarter-final Man of Cash won his third successive race in a fast 28.53 from Farloe Verdict. Droopys Corleone won heat two before Droopys Hewitt defeated Top Savings in the third quarter. Larkhill Bullet claimed the fourth and final heat. In the first semi-final Top Savings beat Farloe Pocket and Droopys Hewitt in 28.64. Droopys Corleone and Maxie Rumble failed to make the final. Larkhill Bullet claimed the easier semi-final from Farloe Verdict and Man of Cash. In the final Man of Cash was first to show but moved off allowing Droopys Hewitt inside at the first bend, kennelmates Larkhill Bullet and Top Savings clashed putting paid to their chances and first bend bunching left Droopys Hewitt clear to win. Farloe Verdict and Top Savings both ran on well.

After becoming a doctor of both laws, he entered the Order of Saint Benedict. He was ordained as a priest and then became archdeacon of Verdun. He later became archdeacon of Metz. He was in attendance at the Council of Basle (1431–43). In 1437, he was a member of the conciliar commission that reported on the poor governance of the church by Pope Eugene IV. In the papal conclave of 5 November 1439 he was one of the supporters of Antipope Felix V. Antipope Felix V made him a pseudocardinal on 6 April 1444 in Geneva, offering him the titular church of San Marcello al Corso. Estaing refused Felix V's offer to make him a cardinal, instead choosing to side with Pope Nicholas V, who absolved him for his earlier support of Felix. In the consistory of 19 December 1449, Nicholas V made Estaing a cardinal priest, awarding him the titular church of Santa Sabina on 12 January 1450. Estaing entered Rome on 30 November 1450 and received the red hat the next day. On 1 March 1451 he was elected Bishop of Sion, though a dispute with the cathedral chapter ultimately led to his resignation as bishop on 11 September 1454. He was present at the secret consistory of 27 October 1451. He served as Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals from November 1452 to 5 November 1453. On 27 June 1453 he was elected Bishop of Fréjus, holding this position until his death. He participated in the papal conclave of 1455 that elected Pope Callixtus III. He died in Rome on 28 October 1455. He is buried in Santa Sabina. ==References== Category:1455 deaths Category:French cardinals Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Bishops of Fréjus Category:French Benedictines ","title":"Guillaume-Hugues d'Estaing"},{"id":"35947495","text":"The FIFA World Coach of the Year was an association football award given annually to the football coach who is considered to have performed the best in the previous 12 months.

There, in 1963, he was awarded an Open Scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he chose to read Architecture. In the year's gap between school and Cambridge, he worked as assistant to animator Trevor Bond,Trevor Bond listing on IMDb database (Retrieved 20 May 2012) where he undertook a range of projects from commercials and educational productions, to feature film titles, including a couple of early James Bond movies. While pursuing architectural studies, Kitching also continued promoting his enthusiasm for the animation medium, including working with Richard ArnallRichard Arnall obituary biography (Retrieved 20 May 2012) to help organise the first-ever British Animation Festival, in 1965.Kitching's poster & program for the British Animation Festival 1965 (Retrieved 20 May 2012)BFI archive entry for British Animation Festival 1965 (Retrieved 20 May 2012) In 1967, after completing studies in Cambridge, Kitching went to work with architect John Hornby in Wimbledon,John Hornby architectural directory listing (Retrieved 20 May 2012) undertaking a diverse range of private projects—from refurbishing the offices of a firm of parliamentary lawyers, to housing estates in Amersham and Beckenham, the conversion of a medieval barn in Sussex, and restoration of a listed Tudor cottage in Selborne. In 1969, he went on to work with Frederick MacManus and Partners, in Marylebone, specialising in architectural graphics, photography and signage, on freelance projects in public housing and healthcare.'Sutton Dwellings, Plough Way, London, SE16', Architectural Design, 1968, p.8. (Retrieved 20 May 2012) ==Early Animation career== In 1969, Kitching also collaborated with veteran Hungarian-born British animator John Halas, who had given him a pre-war 35mm animation rostrum camera. With this, he produced \\"The Dream of Arthur Sleap\\", a cinema commercial for the British Film Institute (BFI),Stills from \\"The Dream of Arthur Sleap\\" (Retrieved 20 May 2012) and \\"Auntie Takes A Trip\\" for the British Kinematograph, Sound and Television Society (BKSTS). In 1970, he directed and animated \\"No Arks\\" for the BFI Production Board,BFI archive entry for \\"No Arks\\" (Retrieved 20 May 2012) a film based on a story and cartoons by Abu Abraham (the then political cartoonist of The Observer newspaper), with narration by Vanessa Redgrave.Play \\"No Arks\\" on YouTube (Retrieved 20 May 2012) In the same year, he also published \\"An Animation Primer\\"—an overview of animation technique, which formed one section of a larger part-work publication \\"The Craft of Film\\" from Attic Publishing Ltd.Biography of David J Fisher, Editor of \\"The Craft of Film\\" (Retrieved 20 May 2012) From 1971, Kitching also published a number of articles in the BKSTS Journal on animation and media in general, including \\"Computer Animation – Answer or Problem?\\" in which he examined the possibilities offered to animators by emerging computer graphics techniques.Alan Kitching, \\"Computer Animation: Answer or Problem?\\", British Kinematography Sound and Television journal, December 1971, pp 436–441. ==The Birth of \\"Antics\\"== In 1972, this led to an invitation from computer artist Colin Emmett for Kitching to join him at the Atlas Computer Laboratory to try programming, using Fortran.Atlas Computer Laboratory, Chilton: 1961–1975 (Retrieved 3 June 2009) By early next year, he had completed a general-purpose animation program, which he named \\"Antics\\". This he subsequently used for numerous animation works, culminating in the 1975 film \\"Finite Elements\\", a documentary explaining the mathematical principles of the Finite Elements method for computing engineering simulations, and how it had been used at the Atlas Lab.Atlas Computer Laboratory – Finite Elements (retrieved 2012/04/22)Play \\"Finite Elements\\" on YouTube (Retrieved 20 May 2012) Kitching first presented the Antics system at the BKSTS \\"Film 73\\" conference in London, and it was then published in the BKST Journal of December 73.

Around 1975, he first met Czech interior designer Eva Gloss, recently emigrated to Britain from (then) Czechoslovakia, who was later to become his partner. Also at this time, Kitching founded \\"Grove Park Studio Animations\\". Further articles and presentations followed, including one to the Swedish Film Institute in Stockholm, which led to Kitching being invited by Swedish TV (then Sveriges Radio – 'SR') to undertake a full-scale prototype project to develop a new version of Antics that would be fully interactive, so that it could be used by any complete beginner without technical knowledge.\\"Not only computing – also art\\", John Lansdown, Computer Bulletin, March 1980 (retrieved 4 September 2012) The project ran from 1977 to 1979, culminating in the movie \\"The Story of G\\".Play \\"The Story of G\\" on YouTube (Retrieved 20 May 2012)\\"Antics Animation at Swedish Television\\", by Alan Kitching, Television journal of the Royal Television Society, March/April 1979, pp 11–14, article describing the interactive version of Antics developed at Swedish TV. ==Developments in Japan== In 1980, Japanese computer maker Nippon Univac Kaisha (NUK) invited Kitching to set up a further Antics development project in Tokyo, to make use of the newest full-colour hardware and VTR equipment. This project ran between 1980 and 1982, and now made the system fully commercial. The first user system was installed at Nippon Animation, and more studios followed—a dozen or so in Japan alone.\\"Antics in Nippon Animation\\", by Alex Pousselle, Byte magazine, October 1983, pp 378–381.\\"About The Cover\\", IEEE Computer Graphics magazine, March 1985, lead article on Antics, cover & pp 6–7.\\"Animators' Tool\\", IEEE Computer Graphics magazine, December 1985, article on Antics by Margaret Neal, pp 5–7.Antics Studios in '80s & '90s (retrieved 2012/04/22) In 1983, Kitching met again with Eva Gloss, who had been producing hand-made ceramic dolls in Southampton, but was now living in London, and the two became partners. Later in the year, in conjunction with Tokyo graphic designer Yukio Ota,Biography of Professor Yukio Ota (Retrieved 20 May 2012) Kitching produced a movie for the United Nations University (UNU), with a commentary by Peter Ustinov. Kitching made the film at NUK, with the assistance of Eva Gloss. Titled \\"Sharing for Survival\\", the film completed early 1984. ==Establishing the Home Studio== In 1985, the DEC \\"MicroVax II\\" became the first mini-computer powerful enough to run Antics, yet also run from a normal domestic power socket. Kitching soon installed one at home, so for the first time had his own Antics studio, and was able to continue its development. In subsequent years, two further new hardware platforms for Antics became available, from Silicon Graphics and Apple Macintosh. With these, many new Antics studios sprang up in Europe, USA, and beyond. In 1989, Kitching was awarded a Fellowship of BKSTS. ==Moving into Multimedia== In the early 1990s, hardware costs were coming down just as performance speeds were increasing. Kitching saw that Microsoft's Windows PC platforms would soon be suitable for Antics, and began concentrating on the emerging market of PC multimedia production. By the late 1990s, the advent of powerful PC and other graphics-based machines were making older systems obsolete, and Kitching saw that this would require a complete new version of the Antics software, using a different design language (C++) – a large-scale project, beyond current resources. Instead, Kitching concentrated on a new field, using computer graphics for scientific modelling of architectural designs for how people move through large public spaces. From 1998, Kitching worked with Legion Crowd Dynamics,Legion Crowd Dynamics home page (Retrieved 20 May 2012) and from 2001, with Prof G.Keith Still.Prof G.Keith Still home page (Retrieved 20 May 2012) ==Lanzarote and the New Antics== In 2004, Kitching and Eva Gloss left Britain to move both to the Czech Republic and to the Canary Isles, exchanging their London home for a cottage in the Czech mountains, and a villa in Lanzarote. Alternating between the Czech cottage and Lanzarote, the couple refurbished the cottage, eventually selling it to move permanently to Lanzarote in 2009. Meanwhile, in 2006, Kitching determined that Antics software still had no close rival on the market, and could now concentrate fully on developing a new 21st-century version, dubbed \\"Antics Classic++\\". The first version of this for Windows was launched for download in 2010, and further updates completed it for the Summer 2011 Edition. Kitching subsequently continued developing the concept, with additional new updates issued periodically, taking it to new functionality beyond the original Antics \\"Classic\\" concepts.Antics Workshop home page (Retrieved 20 May 2012) ==Bibliography== * 1970 \\"The Craft of Film / Part VIII – An Animation Primer\\", Attic Publishing Ltd.

On May 30, 1921, he fought Kid Norfolk for the new colored light heavyweight title in a scheduled 10-round bout in Phoenix, Arizona. Anderson won on a T.K.O. when Norfolk returned to his corner in the ninth round, being unable to continue to fight. (They would meet another three times in non-title bouts between 1922 and 1924, and The Kid prevailed each time.) Anderson defended the title on the Fourth of July 1921 in a 10-round bout in Phoenix, Arizona, beating Rough House Ware on points. When Norfolk fought The Jamaica Kid on December 20, 1921 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, he had claimed the world colored light heavyweight title. He beat the Jamaica Kid on points in an eight-round bout. In Atlanta on January 30, 1922, Norfolk faced Tiger Flowers, the boxer who would become the first African American world middleweight champ in 1926, K.O.-ing him in third round of a 10-rounder. He apparently had vacated the title when he met reigning colored heavyweight champ Harry Wills on March 2, 1922 in Madison Square Garden in New York City for a 15-round bout, losing to the great champion via a K.O. in the second round. Wills outweighed him by 25¾ lbs. On May 9 of that year, Lee Anderson took on Tiger Flowers in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico for a 15-round bout to determine the colored light heavyweight title. Anderson won his second colored crown when he K.O.-ed Flowers in the seventh round. Anderson apparently vacated the title in turn, and Kid Norfolk took the crown title for the second time one day short of a year later, on May 8, 1923, when he K.O.-ed Flowers in the at 2:50 in the first round of a scheduled 12-rounder. The title then went into abeyance. Anderson retired from the ring.

It includes the genera Arcadia, Deltasaurus, Derwentia, Indobrachyops, and Rewana. Derwentiinae was named in a 2011 study that analyzed the phylogenetic relationships of rhytidosteids. It was a replacement name for the family Derwentiidae, which was named in 2000. ==Description== Like many other Permian and Triassic temnospondyls, derwentiines are known primarily from their skulls, which are triangular or rounded when viewed from above. Derwentiines are diagnosed as a clade (evolutionary grouping) by several shared characteristics or synapomorphies: a palate with a nearly straight back margin, a parasphenoid bone at the back of the palate that is covered in small bumps, an ectopterygoid bone on the palate that forms part of the border of a large hole called the subtemporal fossa, and a postorbital bone behind the eye that is rounded or squarish. Although derwentiines are considered the most derived rhytidosteids, the last characteristic is shared with the most primitive rhytidosteids and non- rhytidosteid temnospondyls, suggesting an evolutionary reversal. The small bumps covering the parasphenoid are an unambiguous synapomorphy because the characteristic is only in derwentiines, while all other synapomorphies are ambiguous because they are also present in some other temnospondyls such as Chomatobatrachus and Lapillopsis. ==Classification== Derwentiidae was named in 2000 as a family of Australian temnospondyls in the suborder Stereospondyli. The subfamily Derwentiinae was named in 2011 as a replacement for Derwentiidae because all of these Australian temnospondyls were found to be members of the family Rhytidosteidae. The 2011 analysis also placed Indobrachyops from India in Derwentiinae as the first non-Australian member of the group.

He is known for a retro sound rooted in the rock and roll, rockabilly, and rhythm and blues music of the 1950s. Among influences such as Little Richard and Fats Domino, McPherson also draws inspiration from artists as diverse as the Wu-Tang Clan, Pixies, and Led Zeppelin. ==Biography== McPherson was born as the youngest child in his family in rural southeastern Oklahoma, growing up on the family’s cattle ranch near the town of Talihina. His father was a farmer and ex-army while his mother was a church minister. He took up the guitar at age 13. In high school he played in a number of local punk rock bands and began writing his own songs. He has stated that he has always been in a band of some sort since he was 16 years old. Of his youth growing up in a quiet rural area, he said that this allowed him to involve himself in the pursuit of music: During this time, McPherson also developed a strong interest in 1950s rock and roll after being exposed to the music of Buddy Holly. This went on to shape his song writing and sound for bands he was in such as The Poison Okies and The Starkweather Boys. JD McPherson and band in 2016 He studied visual arts in college, earning a Master of Fine Arts from the University of Tulsa, and later worked as an art and technology teacher. After deciding to pursue music more seriously, McPherson sent a demo to Jimmy Sutton of the small independent record label Hi-STYLE Records, which specialized in roots music. Sutton agreed to produce McPherson's debut album: this became 2010's Signs and Signifiers. On 19 November 2012, Rolling Stone labelled McPherson an \\"Artist to Watch\\" in a 3½ star (out of 5) review of Signs and Signifiers after its wider release through Rounder Records. The band played the acoustic stage at the Glastonbury Festival 2015 on Friday June 26, before continuing their European tour in the Netherlands. The band at the Minnesota State Fair In October 2015, JD McPherson and band appeared (in animated form) as musical guests performing a new and original song \\"Crazy Horse\\" for the DreamWorks animated TV series, The Mr. Peabody & Sherman Show on Netflix. ==Discography== McPherson in 2017 ===Albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:20em;\\" Details ! colspan=\\"3\\" Peak chart positions - style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" US Rock ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" US ! style=\\"width:45px;\\" US Heat - ! scope=\\"row\\" Signs and Signifiers  * Release date: April 17, 2012 * Label: Rounder  47  161  1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Let the Good Times Roll  * Release date: February 10, 2015 * Label: Rounder  17  142  1 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Undivided Heart & Soul  * Release date: October 6, 2017 * Label: New West  19  130  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" Socks  * Release date: November 2, 2018 * Label: New West  —  —  5 } Signs & Signifiers His debut album Signs and Signifiers was released in 2010 on Hi-STYLE Records.

Elections to the Wigan council were held on Thursday, 3 May 1990, with one third of the seats up for election with an additional vacancy in Bryn. Previous to the election there had also been a by-election in Abram, which the Labour Party successfully defended. Despite a wider array of parties - mainly a product from the fractious SLD merger - contesting the election, in several ways it beat 1986's lows in participation. A record of six seats went uncontested as one quarter of the council's wards held no elections, with the Conservatives contesting one half of the wards (an all-time low) and the SLD one quarter (the lowest since 1979). The Greens repeated their last year's total of four candidates, but with only two in the same wards as previous. Elsewhere, Independent John Vickers fought his first of many elections in Hindley Green and the respective Social Democrat and Liberal sides opposed to Alliance merging into the SLD fielded a sole candidate each - the latter of which having previously came within a straw of winning Langtree for the SLD. The night seen numerous surprising gains, with Labour gaining another seat in the SLD bastion of Langtree, and for the first time, in the Conservative's bastion of Swinley, whilst the SLD managed its own breakthrough in the Labour territory of Hope Carr. With dwindling hopes of ever regaining Orrell, Swinley had become the Conservative's bulwark in recent years, and the Labour gain here raised the prospects of Conservative representation being removed altogether from the council. The loss of Hope Carr denied Labour a clean-sweep, but they managed an all-time high of winning all-but-one of the wards, and bettering their last year's record in voter share. Overall turnout in those wards contesting rose to a local elections high (with the 1979 election omitted for coinciding with the general election) of 39.4%. ==Election result== This result had the following consequences for the total number of seats on the Council after the elections: {  - ! valign=top colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width: 230px\\"Party ! valign=top style=\\"width: 30px\\"Previous council ! valign=top style=\\"width: 30px\\"New council - ! style=\\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\\"   Labour  63  64 - ! style=\\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\\"   Social and Liberal Democrats  5  5 - ! style=\\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\\"   Conservatives  3  2 - ! style=\\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\\"   Independent Labour  1  1 - ! style=\\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\\"   Green  0  0 - ! style=\\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\\"   Liberal  0  0 - ! style=\\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\\"   Independent  0  0 - ! style=\\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\\"   Social Democrat  0  0 - ! colspan=2 Total ! style=\\"text-align: center\\" 72 ! colspan=3 72 - ! colspan=2 Working majority ! ! } ==Ward resultsReferences== Category:1990 English local elections 1990 Category:1990s in Greater Manchester ","title":"1990 Wigan Metropolitan Borough Council election"},{"id":"35947752","text":"Delahanty is a family name.

K its total ring of fractions. If B is a subring of a finite extension L of K containing A then B is a one-dimensional noetherian ring. Furthermore, for every nonzero ideal I of B, B/I is finite over A. Note that the theorem does not say that B is finite over A. The theorem does not extend to higher dimension. One important consequence of the theorem is that the integral closure of a Dedekind domain A in a finite extension of the field of fractions of A is again a Dedekind domain. This consequence does generalize to a higher dimension: the Mori–Nagata theorem states that the integral closure of a noetherian domain is a Krull domain. == Proof == Here, we give a proof when L = K. Let \\\\mathfrak{p}_i be minimal prime ideals of A; there are finitely many of them. Let K_i be the field of fractions of A/{\\\\mathfrak{p}_i} and I_i the kernel of the natural map B \\\\to K \\\\to K_i. Then we have: :A/{\\\\mathfrak{p}_i} \\\\subset B/{I_i} \\\\subset K_i. Now, if the theorem holds when A is a domain, then this implies that B is a one-dimensional noetherian domain since each B/{I_i} is and since B = \\\\prod B/{I_i}. Hence, we reduced the proof to the case A is a domain. Let 0 e I \\\\subset B be an ideal and let a be a nonzero element in the nonzero ideal I \\\\cap A. Set I_n = a^nB \\\\cap A + aA. Since A/aA is a zero-dim noetherian ring; thus, artinian, there is an l such that I_n = I_l for all n \\\\ge l. We claim :a^l B \\\\subset a^{l+1}B + A. Since it suffices to establish the inclusion locally, we may assume A is a local ring with the maximal ideal \\\\mathfrak{m}. Let x be a nonzero element in B. Then, since A is noetherian, there is an n such that \\\\mathfrak{m}^{n+1} \\\\subset x^{-1} A and so a^{n+1}x \\\\in a^{n+1}B \\\\cap A \\\\subset I_{n+2}. Thus, :a^n x \\\\in a^{n+1} B \\\\cap A + A. Now, assume n is a minimum integer such that n \\\\ge l and the last inclusion holds. If n > l, then we easily see that a^n x \\\\in I_{n+1}. But then the above inclusion holds for n-1, contradiction. Hence, we have n = l and this establishes the claim. It now follows: :B/{aB} \\\\simeq a^l B/a^{l+1} B \\\\subset (a^{l +1}B + A)/a^{l+1} B \\\\simeq A/{a^{l +1}B \\\\cap A}. Hence, B/{aB} has finite length as A-module. In particular, the image of I there is finitely generated and so I is finitely generated. Finally, the above shows that B/{aB} has zero dimension and so B has dimension one. \\\\square == References == *Nicolas Bourbaki, Commutative algebra Category:Theorems in algebra ","title":"Krull–Akizuki theorem"},{"id":"35947866","text":"Just the Way You Like It is the fifth album released by the R&B; band The S.O.S. Band on the Tabu label in August 1984. It was produced mostly by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis with additional production from the band themselves. ==History== The band worked on their album III, which contained the song \\"High Hopes\\"- a song that was composed by Leon Sylvers III proteges Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Sylvers later took them under his wing to mentor them as songwriters and producers. Tabu Records founder and CEO Clarence Avant took a liking to the song and wanted to know who was behind it. When word got back to Avant that it was the creation of Jam and Lewis, he mistakenly thought they also produced the song. When Avant asked if they wanted to work on The S.O.S. Band's next album, they offered to do so at a reduced rate in order to receive some work as producers. Instead, Avant paid them a fair amount, which lead the duo to contribute three songs to 1983's On the Rise. ==Recording== The band returned to the studio after Jam and Lewis were fired from The Time by Prince after being grounded in Atlanta, Georgia due to a blizzard. As a result, the duo ended up working with The S.O.S. Band again for their next album, Just the Way You Like It. According to Jimmy Jam, the album's title track was inspired by the Southern food chain Waffle House, as he and Lewis were frequent visitors of the restaurant. The duo noticed the company's slogan at the front door and were inspired to write the song. At the time, the song was done at the request of Avant as well as Tabu's then-distributor Epic Records, who wanted a single that was similar to their previous hit for The S.O.S. Band, \\"Just Be Good to Me\\". The song only had a backing track with no lyrics and remained unfinished until Jam and Lewis grabbed a bite to eat. Another single on the album, \\"No One's Gonna Love You\\" was Jimmy Jam's favorite song on Just the Way You Like It as well as his favorite song overall by the band. He acknowledged the influence the song had on UK bands like Loose Ends and 52nd Street as well as it being sampled extensively since the song's initial release. Jam revealed his thoughts on rapper A$AP Rocky sampling the song for his 2011 single \\"Peso\\": > It’s funny, the other day my son was listening to ASAP Rocky, and I said to > him, “You know that’s my song, right?” He said, “What do you mean?” I said, > “The little bassline in that record is from the S.O.S. Band.” He replied, > “No. I didn’t know that.” My kids are always trying to turn me on to new > stuff, and they think I don’t know anything. They were trying to turn me on > to ASAP Rocky, and I had to tell them I cleared the sample for him to use in > the record six months earlier. Jam and Lewis' previous works with Cherrelle and Alexander O'Neal served as the catalyst for their duets between male and female singers. The duo enlisted group member Abdul Ra'oof to sing lead with Mary Davis again- this time for the song \\"Weekend Girl\\". The song was inspired by the concept of couples whose work life took up more time than one's personal life to where the couple could only see each other on the weekend. While most of the band members were present for the Jam and Lewis sessions, lead singer Mary Davis showed up alone to record her vocals for the song \\"Break Up\\". Although Jam and Lewis were the sole writers credited on the first half of the album's songs, Jimmy Jam mentioned the band were fully involved in the creative process. He also noted that group members Jason Bryant and Abdul Ra'oof were the ones responsible for most of the ideas and vocal arrangements. The album was recorded and mixed at Master Sound Studio in Atlanta, Georgia and Creation Audio in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The album was mixed by Steve Hodge, a recording engineer who previously worked at SOLAR Records and helped mix the 1976 self-titled debut album by Boston. Over 30 years later, Jimmy Jam felt Just the Way You Like It holds up well with every other recording they have done throughout their career. ==Chart position== The album peaked at #6 on the R&B; albums chart. It also reached #60 on the Billboard 200. The title track reached the Billboard R&B; Top Ten, peaking at #6. The single also peaked at #64 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #32 on the UK Singles Chart. Two following singles, \\"No One's Gonna Love You\\" and \\"Weekend Girl\\", also charted on the R&B; chart, reaching #15 and #40 respectively. The fourth and final single released, \\"Break Up\\", failed to chart. ==Reissue== The album was digitally remastered and reissued on CD with bonus tracks in 2013 by Demon Music Group. ==Track listingPersonnel== * Credits adapted from liner notes The S.O.S.

Clark's Extra Pop Emporium, and the other two bonus albums pre- packaged with The Mighty Death Pop! were released on amazon.com. A day later, the snippets were removed from the website per Psychopathic Records' request. On August 8, the album along with The Mighty Death Pop! and its other bonus albums were all released early during the 13th Annual Gathering of the Juggalos. \\"Birfday Party\\" originally had plans of including Das Racist, but despite Heems liking the idea of the track, Kool A.D. decided it wouldn't make for a good idea. \\"Shugston Brooks 1959–2004\\" included a sample of REO Speedwagon's \\"Take It on the Run\\". The Insane Clown Posse initially planned to have the remix of \\"When I'm Clownin'\\" from the Extra Pop Emporium as a single music video from that album, but they ultimately nixed that plan when Kreayshawn didn't return their calls to appear in their music video. They replaced her verse in their music video with a cameo appearance from Boondox and a new verse by Danny Brown. == Production == Mike E. Clark's Extra Pop Emporium features several songs originally considered for inclusion on The Mighty Death Pop!. These outtakes include \\"Up Ya Ass\\", \\"Birfday Party\\", \\"Playin' In The Woods\\", and \\"Shugston Brooks 1959–2004\\". The liner notes include explanations as to why each track was not featured on the main album, as well as stories on how every track came to its fruition.

Before the bidding cycle of 1997, Ángel sold his stake to Roberto García-Peña, a journalist at El Tiempo newspaper. Before the closing of the bidding cycle, the family of ex-president Julio César Turbay Ayala had bought the majority of Andes, announcing at the same time that it would withdraw the renewal of the license of the programadora Noticiero Criptón, whose main production was the newscast by the same name that had aired since 1987. In the bidding cycle of 1997 (for the period 1998-2003), Andes was awarded 9.5 hours a week of programming on Canal A, including the noontime news block. In December 1997, the previous owner of that block, Prego Televisión, sold the rights to its Noticiero Nacional to Andes, which began presenting it at the start of 1998. It was unique on that channel as the only programadora that sold its advertising through Comtevé, a unit of Caracol Televisión, instead of through Mejía & Asociados/Datos y Mensajes.

At the time, Business Insider called it \\"TechCrunch 2.0\\". It billed itself at launch as \\"the site of record for Silicon Valley\\". The name was inspired by a tree colony in Utah, Pando, whose massive root system covers 106 acres and is continually sprouting new stems or trunks, even after wildfires have destroyed existing trunks. \\"It’s the perfect metaphor for what I love about Silicon Valley. It’s not just individual hot startups of-the-moment; it’s that unique startup ecosystem that continually shoots up new companies no matter how frothy or scorched everything above ground gets\\", she wrote. At launch, PandoDaily had a number of staff writers and guest contributors including Michael Arrington (founder of TechCrunch), Paul Carr, M.G. Siegler, and Farhad Manjoo. Because of a disagreement, Michael Arrington and M.G. Siegler stopped writing for PandoDaily, but they acquired new technology writers including Greg Kumparak (formerly of TechCrunch). In November 2013, it was announced that PandoDaily had acquired NSFW Corp, a politics-and-humor website founded by technology journalist Paul Carr. PandoDaily stated that the goal of the acquisition was to double down on investigative reporting. Carr then became editorial director of PandoDaily. As of 2013, PandoDaily has acquired the URL \\"pando.com\\" of the defunct Pando's peer-to-peer file-sharing website. In late June 2015, PandoDaily switched to a subscription model, with most of their articles behind a paywall. Any subscriber could unlock an article for 48 hours (with a limit of 20 unlocks per month) and the authors and editors generally unlocked recent articles and tweeted them to readers. Their main reason for the change was to maintain their editorial independence and integrity without being too dependent on particular advertisers (for revenue) or particular investors. On October 23, 2019, Lacy announced that Pando had been sold to one of its partners, BuySellAds, and that she had retired from journalism to focus on her new venture Chairman Mom—a community for \\"working women\\". Lacy cited a history of sexual harassment as justification, explaining that Silicon Valley was \\"a place where I've been lied about, where VCs have arm-twisted editors to fire me, where billionaires have threatened those doing business with me to cut all ties. It's a place where I've had people turn on me again and again and again simply for doing my job. It's a place I've been betrayed by people I trusted. It's a place where one-time friends threatened my children because I wrote about things they did.\\" ==NotorietyUnion remarks controversy=== PandoDaily's creator Sarah Lacy was quoted by American Public Media's Marketplace concerning the Bay Area Rapid Transit worker strike of July 2013: > People in the tech industry feel like life is a meritocracy. You work really > hard, you build something and you create something, which is sort of > directly opposite to unions. Her comments concerning the work ethic of union workers received criticism. ===Uber controversy=== On October 22, 2014, an article by Lacy on PandoDaily was published where she sharply criticised the \\"asshole culture\\" of Uber and said she intended to delete the mobile app from her phone. On November 17, 2014, BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith reported that Uber senior executive Emil Michael \\"outlined the notion of spending 'a million dollars'\\" to hire four top opposition researchers and four journalists. He said that team could help Uber fight back against the press by looking into \\"personal lives, your families\\". Michael was particularly focused on journalist Sarah Lacy, who accused Uber of “sexism and misogyny\\". Lacy wrote a sharp response critical of Uber's actions. The controversy was picked up by CNBC, Business Insider, and The New York Times Bits blog. Michael Wolff, the journalist who had arranged for and invited Smith to the private dinner where the controversial remarks were made, wrote a lengthy piece about the controversy, stating that Uber executives had believed that the event was off-the-record, but that he (Wolff) had failed to communicate the information to Smith. ==ReferencesExternal links== * * Category:American technology news websites Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley Category:Internet properties established in 2012 ","title":"PandoDaily"},{"id":"35948070","text":"Musaeus of Ephesus () was an Ephesian epic poet attached to the court of the kings of Pergamon, who wrote a Perseis in ten books and also poems about Eumenes and Attalus I. ==References== Category:Ancient Ephesians ","title":"Musaeus of Ephesus"},{"id":"35948073","text":"Musaeus of Athens (, Mousaios) was a legendary polymath, philosopher, historian, prophet, seer, priest, poet, and musician, said to have been the founder of priestly poetry in Attica.

The film is set in 1989 in the outskirts of an unspecified Québécois city. ==Plot== François Brochu (Serge Thériault), named \\"the boss\\", is the owner of a gas station. He manages his relationships with his sons Réjean, Guy, the 13-year-old Alain, with which manages the station; and his daughter Nathalie (Fanny Mallette). The Gas Bar is also regularly attended by his friends as Gaston Savard (Gilles Renaud), Jos, Normand Party, Yves Michaud, Claude, Nelson and Ti-Pit. Mr. Brochu, widower and suffering an initial parkinson's disease, would like to keep his family united by the work at the station; but the dissatisfaction of the boys with the routine seems to send them away. Guy (Danny Gilmore) is a harmonica player that plays with a band and is often lacking during the turns, Réjean (Sébastien Delorme) is the most responsible but angry by rising crime and unhappy with his father's way to manage the station. He is an amateur photographer and decides to reach Berlin to see the imminent fall of the wall. The film shows the incoming Revolutions of 1989 in background but life goes on normally around the Gaz Bar, which problems are the transition from gallons to litres, the construction of new self-service stations and the arrival of Gobeil (Daniel Brière), inspector of the company Champlain that owns the station. During the absence of Réjean, Alain starts working alone at the station, helped by Mr. Savard. Guy disappears for 3 days because of a car accident. When he come back, he has a quarrel with his father and leaves the home. Réjean writes quite often at home, telling of his experience and disillusion about the German reunification process.

The club's league campaign surpassed all expectations as 4th spot was achieved and the team qualified for the Champions league play-off round. ==Season summary== 300px The season began with mixed results. A series of home wins and away defeats were reminiscent of previous season's frustration. A convincing win in the Basque derby was the only exception during this disappointing period. Early in November, the club suffered a Copa del Rey defeat away to Segunda División side Córdoba. This was followed by a league defeat at home against 19th-ranked team Espanyol. With the match still in play, fans at the stadium called for Montanier's resignation. In the Copa del Rey, the team was incapable of overturning the first leg's deficit and exited the competition. ===An exceptional run=== With an away victory to Málaga, Real Sociedad began a run that stretched from mid-November to the end of the season where the team suffered only two defeats. The team found stability with a 4–2–3–1 formation comprising Asier Illarramendi and Markel Bergara in the double 6 and Xabi Prieto just ahead of them as an attacking midfielder. ===Race for fourth=== In April, it became clear that either Real Sociedad or Valencia would capture the fourth-place spot. On 28 April, a decisive match between these two took place at Anoeta. Real Sociedad was capable of coming back and won the match, thus opening a five-point gap with Valencia. In the following weeks, however, Valencia won three-straight games while Real Sociedad dropped points. Before the last matchday, Real Sociedad were two points behind Valencia and had to travel to relegation-threatened Deportivo de La Coruña. Real Sociedad won their match and Valencia lost theirs, sending the Basque team to fourth place and securing a spot at the UEFA Champions League play-off round. Real Sociedad scored 70 goals that season, more than any other club bar Real Madrid and Barcelona and had the fourth-best defence. Towards the end of the season, when it seemed like Philippe Montanier was about to renew his contract, he signed a contract with Rennes instead. Montanier was awarded the Ramón Cobo trophy, given to the best manager, by the Royal Spanish Football Federation's coaches committee. ===League table=Dispute over TV broadcasting rights=== Early in 2012, Real Sociedad filed lawsuit against Mediapro on the grounds that payments were not in time or were incomplete. This escalated to a legal case that was eventually won by Real Sociedad. The media group was told to pay what had been established in the contract and €7 million as compensation. Real Sociedad was in addition declared free to sign a broadcasting contract with whoever they wanted to. Weeks before the start of the new season Real Sociedad agreed a 3-year deal with Canal +. Mediapro appealed this decision and in May a provincial court declared that the infringement was not serious enough to justify the €7 million compensation. Real Sociedad had to refund this amount. ==TransfersPlayers leaving the club (summer)=== { class= - !Player !New Team !Fee -  Mikel Aranburu Retired End of contract -  Borja Viguera  Alavés End of contract -  Toño Ramírez  Guadalajara End of contract -  Vadim Demidov  Eintracht Frankfurt €500,000 }  Loan out  {  - !Player !Team -  Joseba Llorente  OsasunaJoseba Llorente loaned to Osasuna ; Realsociedad.comJoseba Llorente will play for Osasuna this season ; osasuna.es -  Jeffrey Sarpong  Hércules - }  Loan end  {  - !Player !To -  Carlos Vela  Arsenal - } ===Players leaving the club (winter)=== { class= - !Player !New Team !Fee -  Jeffrey Sarpong  Contract rescinded } ===Players joining the club (summer)=== Signings {  - !Player !From !Fee -  Chory Castro  Mallorca Free agent -  Carlos Vela  Arsenalhttp://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/carlos-vela-finalises- real-sociedad-switch : \\"Carlos Vela finalises Real Sociedad switch.\\" Arsenal.com.

Dempo Sports Club began as Bicholim Football Club, which was a top First Division league side in the 1960s. Football lovers in the country remember the Bicholim Football Club as one of the most talented football club in the country. Players including Subhash Sinari, Bernard Olivera, Tolentino Serrao, Bhaskar, Kalidas Gaad, Manohar Pednekar, Bhai Pednekar, Ganpat Gaonkar and Pandurang Gaonkar are still remembered to the Bicholim Football Club on a completely different standard compared to the other sports club existing at that moment. Bicholim Sports Club was later adopted by Dempo Souza in 1967 and was renamed Dempo Souza Sports Club. Even then the team remained one of the strongest team in the country with players like Eustaquio, Dass, Balaguru, Olavo, Colaco, Inacio, Felix Barreto, Thapa, Ramesh Redkar, Socrates Carvalho, Sadanand Asnodkar and Tulsidas Alornekar. In 1969, the team stood as the first runner up in the Vasco Sports Club in the Senior Division League. The Dempo Souza Sports Club finally became Dempo Sports Club, after Dempo bought Mr Michael D’’Souza's stake in the Dempo Souza enterprise. However, Dempo Sports Club prospered when Vasantrao Dempo, the chairman of the House of Dempo, extended his benefaction to football team in an extensive manner. Dempo then came at par with the other business houses, like Salgaocar, Agencia Commercial Maritima, Shantilal and Sesa Goa who had their own teams. Dempo Sports Club ==1967-1970== Dempo Sports Club originally started as Bicholim Football Club but was then brought by Dempo Corporation founder Vasantrao S. Dempo in 1967 and then he renamed the club Dempo Sports Club. After being brought by Dempo Sports Club the club went on a spending spree and signed Olavo Pereira, Felix Barreto, Socorro Coutinho, Ramesh Redkar, Socrates Carvalho, Sadanand Asnodkar and Tulsidas Alornekar. Two years later Dempo finished as runners-up in the Goa Senior Division just behind Vasco. ==1971–1980== After the 1971–72 Goa Senior Division, Dempo won their first-ever league title by overcoming teams like Salgaocar and Vasco. Dempo then won the Rovers Cup in 1975, which was Dempo's first ever national championship win, by beating Tata Sports Club, by beating them 1–0. It was not a good decade for Dempo with regards to the Nizam Gold Cup. They lost three consecutive finals in 1972, 1973 and 1974, once to BSF and twice to RAC. But they finally broke the duck, winning the 1978 edition against Customs and Central Excise thanks to a grounder from Dempo skipper and stopper back Nicholas Pereira. Then in 1978 Dempo won the Rovers Cup again by beating Orkay Mills FC 2–1. Dempo then defended that title in 1979 by beating JCT FC in the finals. ==1981-1990== This decade was looked at as the \\"golden age of Dempo Sports Club\\" with players like Camilo Gonsalves, Mauricio Afonso, Jose Fernandes, Alex Fernandes, Mario Soares, Lector Mascarenhas, goalkeeper Chandrakant Naik and Baptist Fernandes playing for the team. In 1982 the club won the Bandodkar Trophy by beating Salgaocar 3–0. They then won the trophy again in 1983 against ITI 5–1 and again in 1984 again against Salgaocar, this time 2–0. Dempo then won the Rovers Cup again in 1986 against Mohun Bagan. After that Dempo once again won the Bandodkar Trophy in 1986. The club also won the Goa Pro League during the 1986 and 1987 season. ==1991-2000== Dempo won their first international tournament in January 1991 in Malé by beating New Radiant SC. They won the match 5–4. Dempo then won the Rovers Cup again by beating Mohun Bagan 2–0. The club then reached the Final of the 1996 Indian Federation Cup but lost. In 1996 Dempo became one of the original 12 clubs in the National Football League and finished top of Group B but finished fourth in the Final Round.http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/india97.html#nfl1 Then during the 1999-2000 season the club got relegated after finishing in last place.http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/india00.html#nfl1 ==2001-2007== In 2001 Dempo won promotion back into the NFL. In 2004 Dempo won the Federation Cup and the National Football League for the first time. They then won the NFL again during the 2006-07 season which turned out to be the last season of the NFL before the I-League started. ==2007-Present== Dempo made Indian Football history when they were one of the first teams to participate in the newly formed I-League. They soon managed to make more history after winning the first ever I-League season in 2007-08. Due to their success in the I-League Dempo participated in the 2008 AFC Cup where they shocked people by making the Semifinals after defeating Singapore side Home United FC 4–3 in the quarter- finals. After winning the 2007-08 I-League season Dempo participated in the 2009 AFC Champions League west Asian qualification stage where they lost to United Arab Emirates side Sharjah SC 3–0. After getting knocked out of the AFC Champions League Dempo failed to win the 2008-09 I-League by finishing 4th in the table. The 2009-10 I-League started brightly as with wins over big rivals Churchill Brothers SC, Mohun Bagan AC, and Mumbai FC. The victory was over goan rivals Churchill Brothers SC which Dempo SC won 4–2. At the end of 26 games Dempo SC came out as champions for the 2nd time in the I-League with a final total of 54 points. The 2010-11 I-League season started off with three losses so far against Kingfisher East Bengal FC, Salgaocar SC, and surprisingly Air India FC. Later in the year Dempo played in the AFC Champions League for the second time ever in their history in the 2011 AFC Champions League west Asian qualification round where they lost 2-0 to Qatar side Al- Sadd. After Dempo were knocked out of the AFC Champions League they entered the group stage of the 2011 AFC Cup. They started the campaign with a 2–1 win over Al-Tilal from Yemen. At the end of the 2010-11 I-League season the defending champs scored the biggest margin victory in the I-League, 14–0 over Air India FC. Then during the 2011–12 I-League season Dempo won the I-League again and thus won their third I-League title. After the 2012-13 season where Dempo finished in 5th place, they parted ways with their most successful coach Armando Colaco with whom they had won 5 League titles. They appointed Arthur Papas who had previously been the coach of All India Football Federation's (AIFF) developmental side, Pailan Arrows.http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130524/jsp/sports/story_16932418.jsp#.U8vUseOSzlo Dempo finished their 2013-14 campaign with a 4th-place finish.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/i-league-points- table/I-League-Points-Table-2013-14/articleshow/23649132.cms ==Footnotes== Category:Dempo S.C.

After a brief stint with a New York Yankees division called Sports Advertising Network, he eventually joined the front office of the Florida Marlins and was there as part of the 1997 World Series championship team. ===Buffalo Bills=== Six days after the Marlins won the World Series, Brandon joined the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League on November 1, 1997.Recalls turn Negrych into an All-Star. The Buffalo News. Retrieved July 11, 2012. Brandon was first named to a high-level executive position within the franchise in 2006, being named director of non-football operations alongside general manager Marv Levy. Brandon, although his title did not change, assumed Levy's responsibilities as de facto general manager after Levy retired. Brandon was promoted to CEO upon the hiring of Buddy Nix as the Bills' general manager. Among other things, he is credited with expanding the Buffalo Bills fan base throughout the Western New York-Southern Ontario region, and was instrumental in the deal for the Bills to play two games per season (one preseason, one regular season) in Toronto, Canada, which many football fans have regarded as a sacrifice of home-field advantage in favor of revenue. An influential NFL executive, Brandon also serves on several league business and marketing committees. As CEO, Brandon increased his influence on the team and handled most of its day-to-day operations while owner Ralph Wilson's health began to decline. This culminated in Wilson officially naming Brandon as president on January 1, 2013, giving Brandon full control over the franchise. Known as the architect of the Buffalo Bills 17 year playoff drought. Brandon is the third person to serve as president of the Bills, after Wilson and Tom Donahoe. Since Wilson's retirement, Brandon had served as the team's representative in owners' meetings in lieu of Wilson, a position he continued even as his widow inherited the trust that held ownership of the team.Graham, Tim (April 3, 2014).

The change also changed Brandon's title with the Bills to that of \\"managing partner,\\" but despite the title change, Brandon did not receive a partnership stake in the franchise (unlike predecessor Larry Quinn, who owned a share of the Sabres during his time of managing partner). ===Resignation=== Brandon announced his resignation from Pegula Sports and Entertainment on May 1, 2018.https://twitter.com/PegulaSE/status/991422014773751809 In a statement to the press, Brandon stated that the departure had been planned since he had reached 20 years with the Bills franchise in November 2017 and that he fulfilled his duties to the Bills and Sabres for the remainder of the season before tendering his resignation.

It opened in 2013, replacing The Gold Mine ride which opened in 1971 at a cost of £150,000, which closed in 2011. It is based on the Wallace and Gromit films and was opened in April 2013 by Nick Park, Amanda Thompson, Nick Thompson, Nick Farmer and Merlin Crossingham. == Design and ride experience == The ride, which cost £5.25 million to make, was created by Blackpool Pleasure Beach design in association with the creators of Wallace and Gromit, Aardman Animations. The cars on the ride are designed on one of Wallace's slippers, so that, when a rider is seated, it is as if they are sitting inside a large slipper. The ride lasts almost four minutes, and features scenes and audio from the Wallace and Gromit films A Grand Day Out, The Wrong Trousers, A Close Shave, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit and A Matter of Loaf and Death. The ride shares exactly the same track layout as the previous Gold Mine Ride where riders experience small drops and sound effects throughout the ride. The ride exits into a gift shop selling Wallace and Gromit merchandise including products such as T-shirts, toys, mugs, hoodies, and keyrings. A concession operated by Picsolve allows for on-ride photos to be purchased. ==See also== * 2013 in amusement parks * Wallace and Gromit == References == Category:Blackpool Pleasure Beach Category:Dark rides Category:Amusement rides introduced in 2013 ","title":"Wallace &amp; Gromit's Thrill-O-Matic"},{"id":"35948310","text":"Joculator pallidus is a species of minute sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Cerithiopsidae.Joculator pallidus at World Register of Marine Species.

There he made the world premiere integral recording of any version of the 24 Paganini Caprices. He became an American citizen and served in the US Army in World War II, giving almost 500 concerts for the troops. He returned to the concert stage after the war, but only five years into his adult career he was killed in a car crash in New Mexico, at the age of 33. He left a number of recordings. ==Biography== Oskar Reiss was born in Vienna in 1920, to non-musical parents who worked as waiters.Arkiv Music He was first seen in public at age 11, and then joined a touring variety troupe for a season in Merano, Italy,Maestronet beginning on 27 October 1933. On the basis that a name less Germanic-sounding than Oskar Reiss, and one more Italianate-sounding, would be highly desirable, his manager suggested 'Ossi Renardi'. His performance of Schubert's A major Sonata and Paganini's D major concerto at the Merano Casino led to an extended tour of Italy. He returned to Vienna for more preparation, keeping his new name but modifying the spelling to Ossy Renardy. There he played at the Konzerthaus in May 1934, then returned to Italy, where in Milan he played under the baton of Victor de Sabata,Classical CD Review who invited him to play with the Vienna Philharmonic.The Classical Music Guide Forums Then came his first tour of the Baltic countries, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austria, France and once again Italy. Renardy went to the United Kingdom in 1937, in order to escape Nazi oppression.The Gramophone, March 1954 He visited the United States the same year. This came about after the wife of an American concert promoter heard Renardy on Italian radio. His New York debut was at The Town Hall on 8 January 1938, after first touring the mid-west states. His regular accompanist from this time onwards was Walter Robert (born Robert Walter Spitz, 1908, Trieste, d. 1999 Bloomington IN; Robert later had a long artistic association with Josef Gingold). At his Carnegie Hall debut on 10 October 1939, Ossy Renardy made an extraordinary impression when he played the Lalo Symphonie espagnole, the Concerto in E minor by Nardini, and the Sonatina in G by Dvořák in the first half, and after interval played all 24 solo Caprices by Paganini. He was aged 19 at the time. The following year (1940) he made the world premiere recording of the complete Caprices (albeit in an arrangement for violin and piano by Ferdinand David, the piano part played by Walter Robert; the first recording of the Caprices in their original solo violin form was not till 1947, by Ruggiero Ricci).Music Web International This was the first of Renardy's many recordings; his last recording, made shortly before his death in 1953, was a second reading of the 24 Caprices. The Guarnerius violin he played was said to have been once owned by Paganini himself, but other sources suggest it was a later copy by Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume. (Renardy's Guarnerius is now owned by an anonymous Australian and is permanently loaned to Richard Tognetti, conductor and principal violinist of the Australian Chamber Orchestra.) Renardy was already playing for the USO in 1941, and the following year he enlisted in the United States Army, becoming an American citizen in 1943. Throughout the war he appeared in 490 USO concerts for the entertainment of American troops. After the war he studied in New York with the famous pedagogues Theodore and Alice Pashkus in order to prepare himself for appearing anew on the stageRenardy is said to have been entirely self-taught prior to meeting Pashkus. Cfr. The Remington Site http://www.soundfountain.org/rem/remrenardy.html . In 1947 he returned to the concert stage, and appeared with many of the major orchestras of North America, Europe and Israel.sound.fountain.org In 1949 he married his sweetheart Suzette Guttwirth, whom he had met in Vienna in 1936. Ossy Renardy was killed in a road accident on 3 December 1953, aged only 33. His accompanist George Robert (b. 1919 Vienna, d. 2006 Albuquerque NM; no relation to his regular accompanist Walter Robert) was driving him from their last concert at Las Cruces, New Mexico, en route to their next engagement in Monte Vista, Colorado. At Tres Piedras near Santa Fe, their car skidded on an ice slick and, while out of control, was hit by another car coming in the opposite direction. George Robert and the other motorists were not seriously injured, and Renardy's Guarnerius was not damaged.Violinist.com This was regarded as a great loss to the musical world at the time. Gramophone's obituary of March 1954 said: \\"At thirty-three he seemed destined to don the mantle of his compatriot Kreisler, whose style of playing was not dissimilar\\". ==RecordingsConcerto=== Ossy Renardy's sole concerto recording with orchestraHe also recorded a violin and piano version of the Violin Concerto No. 1 in A major by Camille Saint-Saëns. was the Brahms Concerto in D major, with the Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam under Charles Munch, made on 27 June 1948. At the time of release, this recording was considered worthy of comparison to those of Heifetz, Szigeti, Neveu and Menuhin. Irving Kolodin reviewed the set in \\"The New Guide To Recorded Music\\" (Double Day, New York, 1950), saying \\"There is no single merit in the Renardy to give it precedence over the Szigeti or Heifetz or Neveu, save a richer serving of the colors in the score than previously provided by any source. However, Renardy's is a very live, youthful, and ingratiating performance, which has its own authentic alertness, consistently controlled. The Munch background is extremely good.\\" Charles Munch was one of Ossy Renardy's greatest admirers, saying of him, \\"There is only one word to describe him: perfection. He has everything - style, technique and tone, combined in the most splendid manner\\". ===Other recordings=== Walter Robert was Renardy's principal accompanist both in recordings and in concert.

She wrote a syndicated column about Hollywood gossip and wrote articles on celebrities for fan magazines. Her \\"Going Hollywood\\" column was syndicated to 400 newspapers, and contributed to movie magazines Movie Mirror, Silver Screen, Movie Teen, Screenland, and Photoplay. Her columns often featured photos of herself with the celebrity she profiled. She befriended several celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and wrote books about Elvis Presley, Clark Gable, and Jayne Mansfield. She was known as \\"Hollywood Date Girl\\" since she wrote about parties that she attended with Hollywood celebrities. ==Biography== May Mann was born to a prominent family in Ogden, Utah. As a child, she loved watching films and reading movie magazines. Her first newspaper publication was in 1934 in The Ogden Standard-Examiner. There she wrote as a society columnist. She met with Hollywood celebrities in Union Station in Ogden. The articles she wrote from these meetings were successful, and movie studios paid for her transportation to and from Hollywood in order for her to continue the good publicity. She started her column, \\"Going Hollywood,\\" in 1936. Mann was Miss Utah in 1938. She attended many parties in Hollywood and thought of herself as a celebrity. In 1938 she wrote an article about Clark Gable for Screenland and one about Wallace Beery in Movie Mirror. In 1939, she spent several months in New York City writing columns about Broadway during the World's Fair. She spent her vacation time working as a reporter for a New York newspaper. Her columns often featured photos of her with the celebrity she wrote about, which she started when a reader doubted that she had actually met with the celebrity. In 1956, she became one of Marilyn Monroe's favourite reporters and confidantes. As such she received a telegram from Monroe setting up a call for a specific time to confide to Mann that she and Arthur Miller would be wed 'at midsummer\\" but was told, 'don't print it yet.' Mann later reported on Marilyn Monroe's wedding to Arthur Miller (after it was announced) for the New York Tribune. Mann continued to write about Monroe up until Marilyn's death in 1962. Mann reported on what she considered to be an \\"inept probe\\" into her close friend, Marilyn Monroe's untimely death. She received a call from chief Parker about the article. Mann relayed, \\"He said it would be bad for my health if I kept writing stories like that.\\" She was a regular contributor to Photoplay 1972–1977. King Features, Faucett Publications and General Features syndicated her \\"Going Hollywood\\" column to 400 newspapers. Mann wrote for movie magazines starting in 1937, and her work appears in Movie Mirror, Silver Screen, Movie Teen, and Screenland. Sometimes she used a pen name, Frances Lane, because she claimed that the Associated Press told her she could only write in one A.P. paper. She described herself as liking everyone, even if they disliked her, and \\"never [said] an unkind word about anyone.\\" Mann interviewed Mae West, Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Joan Crawford, Jayne Mansfield, and Mary Pickford. Mann also wrote extensively about The Osmonds. Later in Mann's career, she became involved in charity work, especially with the Ida B. Mayer Cummings Auxiliary, a charity that helped provide for elderly Jewish people. ==Books== Mann's style was that of an adoring fan. She wrote a book on Elvis Presley called Elvis and the Colonel, where she claimed to have an exclusive \\"authorized\\" interview with Elvis. Writing for The Daily Herald in Chicago, John Lampinen wrote that the book was \\"classic Hollywood pulp\\" showing only Elvis's \\"promotional image.\\" After Elvis's death, author and columnist Molly Ivins updated Elvis and the Colonel, renaming it The Private Elvis. Mann was good friends with the actress Jayne Mansfield. Mann wrote her biography after reporting that Mansfield's spirit haunted her until she wrote the book. ==Personal life== Mann was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints and abstained from smoking or drinking her whole life. Mann was married to David H. Mann, a writer and editor at the Ogden newspaper, for at least two and a half years before they were divorced in 1944. David Mann sued for divorce because of desertion. Mann married Al Leon, a former concert singer who was from San Francisco in 1945. Their wedding was held in Falcon Lair and covered by Louella Parsons. Fellow columnist Cobina Wright sent invitations and managed the wedding. Mann and Leon divorced in 1948. May married Buddy Baer in 1949, and a divorce was granted in 1956. Mann died in Los Angeles on April 15, 1995. ==Celebrity gowns== Evening gown and shawl owned and worn by Marilyn Monroe, given to Mann An evening gown and shawl that had previously belonged to Marilyn Monroe had been in Mann's possession until 1992 when she gave it to Arlene and Milt Larsen to exhibit at the Magic Castle Museum. In 2017, it was sold for an undisclosed price. == Works == * \\"A Date With Clark Gable\\", Screenland magazine, May 1937. * Elvis and the Colonel * Jayne Mansfield * My Friend Clark *Marilyn Monroe (now thought to have been lost) * Princess, Drake Publishers, 1976.

Motukoreaite was first noted in 1941 and officially described in 1977. ==Description== Motukoreaite occurs as claylike cement or hexagonal tabular crystals up to in size that form rosettes, boxworks, and subparallel aggregates. The crystals are semitransparent and are white, pale yellow, pale yellow-green, or colorless. The mineral readily dehydrates partially. Motukoreaite has been found in association with apatite, barite, calcite, chabazite, calcic plagioclase, gismondine, gypsum, hisingerite, hydrotalcite, limonite, magnetite, montmorillonite, nordstrandite, olivine, phillipsite, pyroxene, quartz, and zeolites. ==Formation== Motukoreaite forms from the alteration of submarine basaltic glass at temperatures below .Zamarreño, p. 1058. The alteration occurs in the sequence motukoreaite, phillipsite, calcite. A study in 1989 suggested that motukoreaite is a common, widely occurring mineral.Zamarreño, p. 1054. ==History== Motukoreaite was first identified as \\"beach limestone\\" by J. A. Bartrum in 1941 at two locations along the shore of Motukorea where it occurs as a coating or alteration of basaltic sand and basaltic tuff related to a small Pleistocene volcanic cone.Rodgers, p. 389. In 1977, the new mineral was officially described from the island and the name motukoreaite was approved by the Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names in honor of the island. The mineral's small crystal size made determination of its optical properties difficult.Rodgers, p. 390. ==Distribution== Motukoreaite is known from Motukorea, New Zealand, La Piatta quarry in Italy, Stradner Kogel in Austria, and the western Mediterranean Sea near Spain. It has been reported from the Surtsey Island and other locations on the mid-Atlantic Ridge. It also occurs along the axial rift of the Red Sea.

The group name is inspired by the Aristocrats joke and consequently the song titles on their debut namesake album–a progressive rock compilation–are rife with salacious double-entendres.Bryan Beller Interview on Outsight Radio Hours. Archive.org. Retrieved 22 July 2012. == Formation and history == The band was formed after a wildly enthusiastic response to a concert performance at The Anaheim Bass Bash during the Winter NAMM show in January 2011. The trio had just one rehearsal before the concert but still performed well and amazed the audience as well as themselves. Originally the guitarist for that one-off show was to be Greg Howe, replaced by Guthrie Govan at the last moment. Guthrie later stated: \\"The chemistry was so great, that when we came offstage we all said to each other: 'This is working. We should record this.'\\" The band would later get together and meet in Chicago to record their debut album, which took just under two weeks. The music album reflected their respective influences, ranging from 70s fusion (Return to Forever), to progressive (King Crimson), to instrumental rock (Steve Vai, Joe Satriani), to rap metal (Rage Against the Machine) and to just plain absurdity (Frank Zappa). Bassist Bryan Beller stated, \\"We ended up using our different influences to write for each other. I wrote \\"Sweaty Knockers\\" specifically for Guthrie to have fun with, while Guthrie wrote “I Want A Parrot” with bass leads in mind. As for Marco's material, we're just lucky to be able to keep up with it!”.Review: The Aristocrats Debut Album . Guitarnoize.

The mineral was discovered in 1889 from a mine in Sweden. It was named for the Greek words for walnut and felt in reference to its appearance. ==Description== Caryopilite is reddish-brown to tan in color naturally; in thin sections, it is light brown to yellow. The mineral occurs as tabular pseudohexagonal crystals, commonly as rosettes, up to . It can also be stalactitic, reniform with a concentrically radiating structure, or have massive habit. The mineral forms as a product of metamorphism in manganese-bearing minerals. Caryopilite has been found in association with brandtite, calcite, gonyerite, jacobsite, lead, manganoan calcite, rhodonite, sarkinite, tirodite. ==Structure== Caryopilite consists of triangular islands formed by tetrahedra rings coordinated with sheets containing octahedrally coordinated manganese. The crystal structure shows some short-range order, but linkages between islands are fully disordered. Thus, no unit cell can truly be defined.Guggenheim, p. 163 ==History== In 1889, caryopilite was discovered from the Harstigen Mine in Filipstad, Värmland County, Sweden. Hamberg identified it as a new mineral and, on the suggestion of Professor Brögger, named it karyopilit. The name is derived from the Greek words κάρυον or \\"walnut\\", in reference to the mineral's brown color and crystal habit, and πΐλος or \\"felt\\", for its appearance under a microscope.Hamberg, p. 27. In 1917, Gust Flink discovered a mineral he named ectropite (also spelled ektropite) that was most closely related to caryopilite. In 1927, after a new specimen of bementite was discovered that appeared almost identical to caryopilite, it was recommended that caryopilite be invalidated as a mineral species. However, a 1964 study determined that what had been known as bementite was actually a mixture of two different minerals. Bementite and caryopilite were redefined as distinct species, and caryopilite was made equivalent to ectropite. These changes were accepted by a large majority of the IMA Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names. In 1980, a study suggested that caryopilite be assigned to the friedelite group rather than the serpentine group. ==Distribution== , caryopilite has been found in Austria, Canada, China, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, Sweden, the UK, and the US. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * * ==External links== Category:Monoclinic minerals Category:Manganese(II) minerals Category:Magnesium minerals Category:Phyllosilicates Category:Hydroxide minerals ","title":"Caryopilite"},{"id":"35948614","text":"The 1986–87 NBA season was the Mavericks' 7th season in the NBA.1986-87 Dallas Mavericks After winning Game 1 in a high-scoring affair, the underdog Seattle SuperSonics took the next three games, ending the Mavericks season.

Prior to redevelopment in the mid-2010s, it was the site of the Herongate Mall, a medium-sized mall launched in 1981. It is currently owned by Trinity Financial. ==Ownership== * 2011–Present: Trinity Financial * 2007-2011: Transglobe Property Management * Unknown-2007: Oxford Propertieshttp://www.obj.ca/Real-Estate/Non- residential/2011-06-07/article-2565120/UPDATE%3A-RioCan- targets-$18M-Herongate-Mall-purchase/1 * 1981 - Unknown: Marathon Realty (property development branch of Canadian Pacific Limited), then owners of Place d'Orleans and Merivale Mall. ==History1980s: inception=== The mall opened its doors to the public on Wednesday August 12, 1981. It was anchored by a Dominion (A&P; after 1985) supermarket at one end and a Zeller's at the other. The 195,000 square foot indoor mall hosted over 40 businesses and services including a bakery, hairdressers and clothing stores. It was surrounded by 1,100 parking spaces, for an overall area of over 16 acres. The mall aimed to serve a market of 82,000 potential clients living in the neighbouring developments, including the Minto Heron Gate project. In response to concerns of nearby residents the City of Ottawa conducted a traffic survey in the fall of 1981. Residents feared the new mall would increase excessively traffic on Jefferson Avenue. In 1969, residents had feared commercial development in the area would attract drag racing teenagers. ===1990s: growth=== Rockin' Johnny's Diner and Zellers opened locations at Herongate Mall in the 1990s. ===2000s: decline=== Many stores either closed or changed names in the 2000s. The Zellers location became a Sears Canada outlet in the early 2000s, then split between two tenants (Convergys, and an independent furniture store) during the late 2000s. The Rockin' Johnny's Diner was also converted to an independent restaurant under a different name (the South Side Bar and Grill). Santa Claus had a location during the Christmas and holiday season, but later left the mall due to vandalisms that read \\"NO SANTA\\" on Herongate Mall's exterior walls. ===2010s: Convergys layoff, redevelopment=== Convergys closed its location and vacated the building in 2011. Also in 2011, Trinity Development purchased Herongate Mall from Transglobe Property Management for $18 million.http://www.obj.ca/Real-Estate/Non- residential/2011-06-07/article-2565120/UPDATE%3A-RioCan- targets-$18M-Herongate-Mall-purchase/1 Trinity's master plan shows a total of 16 smaller buildings surrounded by parking spaces on the same Herongate footprint. The indoor mall would disappear. In April 2012, Trinity confirmed that Food Basics would be the only store remaining of the legacy Mall. The remainder of the mall would be torn down and either be added to the parking lot or be developed into a string of smaller standalone stores.http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/herongate-mall-set-for- redevelopment-1.1247512 In June 2012 a construction company started demolition, leaving only the Food Basics as the only part of the original mall. During that same month, a fire occurred in the Dollarama. In the summer of 2013, Scotiabank closed its in-mall location and moved into a brand new standalone location on Heron Road, northwest of the mall's original footprint. In late 2013, the demolition of the legacy mall was completed and the Food Basics had a new entrance from the west parking lot, previously where the rest of the mall stood. As of early 2014, several standalone buildings have been occupied both by tenants who used to occupy a space in Herongate Mall and new tenants. These include Scotiabank, Subway, a barber, and Pharma Plus. As of February 2015, Dollarama re-opened at the mall after an almost three-year hiatus. ==ControversyMaintenance problems=== The Ottawa Branch of Acorn Canada criticized then-Herongate Mall property owner Transglobe for letting the mall's stores deteriorate and become unsanitary. In April 2010 CBC News published an article noting the \\"limbo\\" of Herongate Mall. Some mall tenants noted in recent years they had lost up to 30 percent of their business due to the poor maintenance of the mall. The tenants accused the landlord, Transglobe Property Management at the time the article was written, of neglecting the building's pest and rodent issues and problems with the building's plumbing. The City of Ottawa Public Health and fire department have visited the mall on several occasions to investigate \\"complaints of blocked exits and water damage to ceilings during the same time period.\\" ==Public transit== OC Transpo routes 44, 112 and 291 serve the area. ==References== Category:Shopping malls in Ottawa Category:Shopping malls established in 1981 Category:Shopping malls disestablished in 2011 ","title":"Herongate Square"},{"id":"35948616","text":"is a subway station on the Sapporo Municipal Subway in Toyohira-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, operated by the Sapporo Municipal Subway.

The trail extends from the headwaters at Lake Itasca in Minnesota to near the mouth of the river in Venice, Louisiana. Much of the trail’s follows roadways used by motor vehicles, although some of the route is on multi-use trails. == Designation and signage == Mississippi River Trail sign The Mississippi River Trail was designated as U.S. Bicycle Route 45 in 2013. Signs that designate the route use the \\"MRT\\" abbreviation. Approved for use in 2012 by the Federal Highway Administration, the green bicycle route sign is an alternative of the standard U.S. Bicycle Route (M1-9) sign. It features a green background with a white triangle, a bicycle symbol, and the route designation shown in green letters or numerals. The sign is not considered proprietary and can be any local jurisdiction. Since the route is co-designated, it may feature either a black U.S. Bicycle Route 45 sign or the green Mississippi River Trail sign. Limited budgetary resources within local jurisdictions, however, has led to inconsistent and limited signage along the entire route. Adequately signing the route is considered a best practice for local jurisdiction seeking to enhance utilization of the route and improve conditions for cyclists. == Route description == The trail is divided into three sections: Northern, Central, and Southern.MRT website In some locations trails are along both sides of the river. === Northern section===  Minnesota  The north entrance of Minnehaha Trail, a signed portion of the MRT in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. The MRT begins at Itasca State Park, near the headwaters of the river. Itasca State Park also contains more than of paved biking trails. After it leaves the park, the MRT winds north along the river, traversing county roads to the city of Bemidji. Here the main trail connects to a number of city and regional trails. From Bemidji, the MRT heads southeast along the Paul Bunyan Trail, a state-developed rail-trail conversion. This paved trail extends from Bemidji to Brainerd. From Brainerd, the MRT follows county roads, some with marked bike lanes and some with paved shoulders, through the cities of Little Falls and St. Cloud. South of St. Cloud, the surroundings become more urban as the rider approaches the Twin Cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul. The route through the two cities passes St. Anthony Falls, Minnehaha Falls Regional Park, and Fort Snelling State Park, among other protected areas and regional parks. In Minneapolis, MRT segments appropriate the established Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway trails and Minnehaha Trail. South of St. Paul, the MRT passes through several smaller cities before reaching Lake Pepin. The route passes through Wabasha and Winona on its way to the Wisconsin state line.  Wisconsin  The Wisconsin section of the MRT begins at Prescott and continues along the eastern side of the river all the way to Illinois. The section north of Prairie du Chien primarily follows the Great River Road, while the section south follows various state and county highways. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has prepared an online publication, The Great River Road Mississippi River Trail Bicycle Map: A Guide for Cycling Along Wisconsin's Great River, which offers a detailed section by section guide of the Wisconsin route complete with road maps, services, campgrounds and route descriptions.

It is co-written by Semi Chellas and Matthew Weiner, and directed by Phil Abraham. It aired on AMC in the United States on May 27, 2012. The episode takes place in January 1967. Pete asks Joan to make a personal and moral sacrifice to ensure the company lands the Jaguar account. Meanwhile, the creatives work long nights to come up with the perfect pitch for the presentation. Don becomes furious after learning of the impact Megan's new profession will have on their life. Feeling unappreciated, Peggy has lunch with Freddy Rumsen, who encourages her to make a move. Peggy then meets with Ted Chaough, from rival firm CGC, and accepts an offer for chief copywriter. \\"The Other Woman\\" was critically acclaimed, with some critics calling it one of the best episodes of the series. Jon Hamm, Elisabeth Moss, and Christina Hendricks were lauded by journalists for their performances in this episode. \\"The Other Woman\\" was watched by 2.07 million viewers and received an adult 18–49 rating of 0.6, marking a slightly higher viewership than the previous episode. ==Plot== The SCDP Jaguar team discusses taglines. Stan suggests one using the word \\"mistress\\", but Don reminds him the client would not want to hear that word in an advertisement and excuses himself. Peggy asks Don's approval of one of her projects but he tells her that she is in charge until Jaguar is done. She watches as a lobster lunch is delivered to the Jaguar team. Ken and Pete dine with Herb Rennet, head of the Dealers Association and a member of Jaguar's selection committee. Herb suggests SCDP’s competitive standing might be improved if they arrange an evening for him with Joan. Pete tells Joan about Herb's proposal. Shocked, she asks how Pete would feel if someone asked that of his wife Trudy. He asks Joan how much it would take to convince her. She replies that he \\"couldn't afford it\\". Subbing in for Ginsberg while he works on Jaguar, Peggy attends a conference call with Chevalier Blanc. The company wants to pull the Hard Day's Night ad but she spontaneously comes up with changing the existing ad to targeting women instead and wins the client over. Pete presents Herb's proposal at a partners meeting, guaranteeing SCDP will lose the account if they do not comply. Don spurns the idea and leaves, but the remaining partners reluctantly agree to offer Joan $50,000. They decide to withhold Christmas bonuses and extend their credit line to cover the cost, unaware that Lane had already extended the credit line by $50,000 in the previous episode. Don instructs the Jaguar team to ditch the mistress concept because it is vulgar. Later, Harry praises Peggy's work on Chevalier Blanc. She tells Don the client ultimately went with the same ad as before, only in a Paris setting. Don says Ginsberg will take over once the Jaguar pitch is finished, prompting Peggy to quip that she is not in charge of everything. Don pulls some money from his wallet and condescendingly tosses it in Peggy's face, telling her to go to Paris. Ken tries to comfort her, saying that Don is just upset about Jaguar, to which she replies that she does not care. Lane advises Joan to demand a 5% partnership stake in the company, adding that, when he thought he was essential to the future of the firm, he settled for much less than he felt was due him. Joan later tells Pete she wants a partnership, comprising 5% of the business and voting rights, in exchange for her spending the night with Herb. Pete asks how to make the arrangements, to which she icily and rhetorically asks if she has to do it all. Pete later tells Don about the arrangement with Joan. Don visits Joan's apartment to dissuade her. She thanks him and wishes him luck on the presentation, but it is eventually revealed that, unbeknownst to Don, her sexual encounter with Herb had already taken place. Pete tells Trudy he wants an apartment in the city, but she refuses, telling him that his love affair with Manhattan is over and that they have not even been trying for a second child. The next day, Megan tells Don that her audition gained her a callback for Little Murders and rehearsals begin shortly in Boston. He voices his displeasure at her being gone for three months. She accuses him of expecting her acting career to fail. When the callback does not go well, she tells him that, if she has to choose between him and the play, she would choose him, but will hate him for it. He assures her that he does not want her to fail, and they kiss. Ginsberg observes Megan's freewheeling and confident behavior around Don when she visits the office, and he later approaches Don with a new Jaguar concept portraying the car as an unattainable woman: \\"Jaguar: At last, something beautiful you can truly own.\\" Don smiles. Over lunch with Freddy Rumsen, Peggy gripes about her exclusion from Jaguar. Freddy suggests she leave SCDP and offers to help. The next day, Don presents the pitch to Jaguar. Herb smiles as Don unveils the tagline. Joan inquires of Don about the presentation. Peggy meets Ted Chaough from Cutler Gleason and Chaough to discuss job opportunities and he praises her work. She writes her job requirements, \\"Copy Chief $18,000/year\\", on a piece of paper and slides it across the table to him. Chaough crosses out $18,000 and writes $19,000. Peggy orders a chocolate shake. The following day, Roger summons all the partners to his office to learn the fate of their Jaguar presentation. Don locks eyes with Joan when she joins them, realizing that she has, in fact, slept with Herb. Roger receives the congratulatory confirmation call from Jaguar, and the office erupts in celebration. In Don's office, Peggy informs him she has accepted a job with CGC. He thinks she is asking for a raise and attempts to negotiate salary, but she tells him it is not about money. She holds back tears as he kisses her hand. She walks out of the office and smiles as she waits for an elevator. ==Production== The episode was co-written by Semi Chellas and Matthew Weiner, and directed by Phil Abraham. Weiner said in August 2012 that he intended for Peggy's departure from SCDP to be in \\"The Other Woman\\", which is centered on Joan: \\"[the episode is] literally about the quantification and value of women in the workplace and the relationship of their sexuality to it. I knew that on a subconscious level at the writing stage, because of the way the stories went together. As these stories fold in together, it starts to become about that, but it was always about what you have to do to get ahead, in a very simple way, and the opportunities to get ahead.\\" The nonlinear narrative involving Joan's storyline and Don's Jaguar pitch was \\"a solution to how to tell the story\\" according to Weiner. \\"The ordering of those events really was a problem and we got to a point where we can either show Don doing the pitch, or show Joan being with the guy, but we can't do them both,\\" he said, explaining that he felt \\"if Don gives the pitch after [the audience has] seen Joan do this, no one is going to listen to a word that he says. It doesn't matter how good it is. [The audience is] not going to believe he could have won.\\" Chellas \\"had this great idea, this elliptical thing, which we really loaded up with cues so that you would know at the end that Don was too late. Seeing Joan in there, taking the necklace off, and Joan's mother taking Don's hat into the room where Joan was, and then Joan putting on the green robe and coming out, seeing that behind-the-scenes moment the second time really cemented it.\\" Weiner said this allowed them to \\"show Joan going through with it 24 hours beforehand, and then show Don giving this pitch that the audience is convinced is a great pitch. Then you slowly dissolve back to the reality of Don coming in [to work] pretty happy, Joan asking how it went, and Roger having this dead response—'it was one of his good ones'—and Don wondering why Joan's not more excited.\\" Abraham spoke about shooting a scene of the episode in August 2012: While discussing the prostitution plot, Christina Hendricks said, \\"This is a very confusing situation for Joan and for everyone involved. First off, it's just completely insulting. Second of all, it's quite an opportunity. Then all of a sudden you put the money involved or the opportunity involved or you put a label on it, then it becomes a scary road to go down.\\" Hendricks said that Joan's motivation was \\"protection [for] her child.\\" Hendricks felt that Joan saw herself as an equal in a way to the other partners after going through with the deal, as Joan had seen them do worse things over her thirteen years in employment. Vincent Kartheiser called the storyline an example of an \\"amoral\\" business tactic. Kartheiser described Pete as doing \\"what he thinks he needs to do to get the account. I don't know if that's always such a good thing, but it's common in business. And I think in that situation, Pete represents that type of businessman.\\" Matthew Weiner and Jared Harris both characterized Lane's decision as two-fold—he gave Joan the best advice for her and for himself. Jon Hamm praised the prostitution sequence as \\"Very elegant paired with Don's pitch to Jaguar. This idea of something beautiful that you could possess, that you could own. It's one thing when you're talking about a car. It's something else when you're talking about a human being.\\" Elisabeth Moss said she was not told by Weiner that Peggy would be leaving SCDP \\"until we were shooting episode 10, the one right before it. It was unusual that he didn't tell me. He usually tells me what's happening, pitches me things to ask me how they sound.\\" Moss' initial reaction \\"was just one of feeling like there was really no other logical way to go for her. After everything that had happened for five years, she can't just keep butting her head up against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don.\\" Moss also said, \\"I will thank [Weiner] forever for not telling me. It would have made my life harder. I knew about Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not be in my head. Not knowing Peggy would quit allowed me to find it for myself, to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season.\\" According to Moss, Peggy \\"has the capability of being a Don Draper, and there can't be two of them in the office.\\" The goodbye scene between Don and Peggy was a difficult one to shoot. Moss said, \\"That scene was a really, really tough scene to do. They didn't tell me they were going to do this, but they told Jon to hold my hand and not let it go. Then he did, and I lost it. Every single one of those tears were absolutely real. She wants to stay with all of her heart. She does not want to leave, but she knows she has to.\\" Hamm said there was \\"respect, understanding, and admiration between those two characters. This is the exact right time for her to leave.\\" ===References to other media=== * Peggy pitches a Lady Godiva-themed ad for Chevalier Blanc. * Herb mixes metaphors about The Sheik of Araby and Helen of Troy during his assignation with Joan. * Peter reads Goodnight Moon to his baby and later that night complains to Trudy there are no \\"goodnight noises\\" where they live. ==ReceptionCritical reception=== The episode's storyline involving Joan Holloway (Christina Hendricks, pictured) was heavily scrutinised by commentators The episode received much acclaim from television journalists. The storyline involving Joan's prostituting herself to secure the Jaguar account for Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce came in for particular analysis and scrutiny among journalists, as related to its execution and use of themes of female sexuality and sexual objectification. Alan Sepinwall fought with himself over the execution of the prostitution story in this episode, asking, \\"If you buy that the partners would be willing to sell Joan, and that Joan would feel the same way, then this is an all-time great episode of the series. But if you don't, then it's Weiner and company making the characters act against their natures to fit the theme.\\" Sepinwall described the story as \\"something that so fundamentally changes the way you view a number of major characters, and the show that uses them, that it has to be just about perfect to work, and maybe not even then.\\" Emily VanDerWerff opined that, \\"'The Other Woman' shouldn’t work. It’s so obviously constructed to be a 'message' episode, and the message is far from subtle: No matter what we try to do to make them equal, men are always going to turn women into objects on some level, because that’s just how men perceive them.\\" VanDerWerff compared it to the episode \\"Employee of the Month\\" of The Sopranos, even going so far as to call \\"The Other Woman\\" a stronger episode. Weiner was \\"surprised\\" by the reaction to Joan's storyline: In August 2012, Hamm said \\"The Other Woman\\" was his favorite episode of the fifth season of Mad Men, and spoke about the reaction to Joan's storyline: The final scene in which Peggy leaves both Don and the agency was pinpointed by critics as a standout sequence. Maureen Ryan said, \\"the scene between Don and Peggy was tremendous, but Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss are always magnificent together. It's no coincidence that their final pose—Don at Peggy's waist, kissing her hand—recalled Don's brutal reconciliation with Megan a few weeks ago, kneeling, begging her to stay with him.\\" In August 2012, Moss said the final scene was her favorite of the season: \\"It would've been so easy to have it be tears and trauma and music, but it's so simple, almost over before you know it. It brings you to a dark, sad place then gives you this slap in the face when she turns to the elevator and smiles. Matt [Weiner] and I didn't feel it was a sad thing. It says to the audience, 'No, you don't get to cry all night about this. ===Accolades=== The episode won the Writers Guild of America Award for Episodic Drama. This episode also received directing and writing nominations for the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards. Due to their nomination, Jon Hamm, Elisabeth Moss, and Christina Hendricks all submitted this episode for consideration for the Lead Actor, Lead Actress, and Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, respectively, for the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards. ===Ratings=== \\"The Other Woman\\" was watched by 2.07 million viewers and received an adult 18–49 rating of 0.6, marking a slightly higher viewership than the previous episode. ==ReferencesExternal links== * \\"The Other Woman\\" at AMC * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Mad Men (season 5) episodes ","title":"The Other Woman (Mad Men)"},{"id":"35948699","text":"Martha Saxton is an American professor of history and women's and gender studies at Amherst College who has authored several prominent historical biographies. ==Life== She graduated from Columbia University, and University of Chicago.

Known for his reporting on forced evictions in Baku, Abbasov was badly beaten in 2012, allegedly by SOCAR security personnel. ==SOCAR reporting== In 2011, Abbasov began reporting on protests against SOCAR, the state oil company, by Sulutəpə citizens whose homes were being demolished by the company. After he began his reporting, security personnel for the company sent a digger to destroy his father's home, damaging the roof and walls. In recognition of his work, Index on Censorship awarded him the Guardian journalism award in March 2012 for \\"investigative journalism of dogged determination across a range of media, including print, online, radio and television\\". In his acceptance speech, Abbasov acknowledged other Azerbaijani journalists at risk, saying: \\"This is the price that my colleagues in Azerbaijan are paying for the right of the Azerbaijani people to know the truth about what is happening in their country. For the sake of this right we accept that our lives are in danger, as are the lives of our families. But the goal is worth it, since the right to truth is worth more than a life without truth.\\" ==Attack== Idrak Abbasov has sustained numerous injuries while performing professional activity. The most serious of them were suffered in 2001, 2005, 2009 and 2012. On 12 May 2001, Abbasov was hit by a police baton on his head while the police were dispersing an opposition rally in the center of Baku. (Craniocerebral injury, concussion of the brain) On 9 October 2005, during dispersal of an opposition rally in the center of Baku, a plainclothes policeman hit Abbasov with a brass knuckle on his right temple and left side of the jaw (Craniocerebral injury, concussion of the brain, several teeth broken.) On 20 March 2009, employees of the Ministry of National Security of Nakhchivan Republic arrested Abbasov by pulling a sack over his head, and for three hours the minister himself questioned him under physical and psychological pressure. (As a result, he suffered neuro-angina) On 18 April 2012, while preparing a report about forceful demolition of houses by SOCAR in Sulutapa settlement of Baku, Abbasov was brutally beaten by a group of security guards of SOCAR. (fracture in the right eye socket, two ribs broken, craniocerebral injury, concussion of the brain, injuries to the left kidney and other organs). On 18 April 2012, Abbasov was attacked, allegedly by company security officials and police, while filming a protest. His attackers beat and kicked him until he was unconscious. Abbasov was hospitalized with two broken ribs, a concussion, severe damage to one eye, and damage to his internal organs. Speaking later to BBC News, he alleged that the guards had intended to kill him, and had only ceased the assault when Abbasov's brothers came to defend him; Idrak Abbasov's brother Adalet Abbasov was also hospitalized after intervening in the beating. Another journalist reported being restrained and forced to watch the attack, which she said was 5 to 7 minutes in length. An aide to president Aliyev denied the journalists' allegations, saying that Abbasov had in fact been assaulted by \\"foreign special services\\", commonly understood to refer to agents of Azerbaijan's regional enemy Armenia. When interviewed by Index on Censorship on 11 May, Abbasov was still recovering from his injuries, but attempting to work from home, saying, \\"I’m a journalist. And I have three children to support.\\" The attack drew international attention. On 24 May, the European Parliament passed a resolution in support of Abbasov and another journalist, Khadija Ismaylova, who reportedly was being threatened for her reporting. The resolution called on the Azerbaijani government for an \\"immediate stop to all actions aimed at suppressing the freedom of expression and assembly\\". Human Rights Watch named the case as part of \\"Azerbaijan’s appalling record on freedom of expression\\", and called for \\"a prompt and effective investigation into the vicious attack\\". Amnesty International condemned that \\"journalists in the process of exposing human rights abuses are themselves coming under attack by state officials bent on preventing them from reporting the truth\\", and called for the case to be \\"thoroughly and impartially investigated\\". The Guardian, The Daily Telegraph, The Independent, The Wall Street Journal, CBC News, and BBC News connected the case with the upcoming Eurovision Song Contest, stating that the spotlight it had brought to Azerbaijan, the contest's host, had done little to help the nation's activists. Abbasov himself commented, \\"I can't imagine what they will do to us after Eurovision. There are not so many of us.\\" ==References== Category:Living people Category:1970s births Category:Journalists from Baku ","title":"Idrak Abbasov"},{"id":"35948768","text":"T.W.

Initiated in 2011, the service operates a single loop through the city. Selkirk commenced its new service with one month fare-free introductory period. Service is provided on weekdays from 6:00 AM-6:00 PM and on Saturdays from 8:00 AM-6:00 PM. The regular fare is $2. The bus runs once per hour. ==Selkirk to Winnipeg commuter busBeaver Bus Lines (discontinued)=== The earliest mention of Beaver Bus Lines dates back to July 1946 when the company applied to serve employees of Canada Cement Company in Fort Whyte and be allowed to use all Winnipeg Electric bus stops along Pembina Hwy. as well as bus stops between the cement plant and the Union Bus Depot on Hargrave St. at Graham Ave. In February 1948 St. Vital Council met with representatives of Winnipeg Electric and Beaver Bus Lines to serve St. Mary's Rd. and St. Anne's Rd. between Berrydale and Lot 62 and Berrydale and the Sanatorium (now St. Amant) with fares set at 5 centsand would be partly subsidized by Winnipeg Electric. However, by December of that year, Beaver Bus had proposed to cut back or cancel service to St. Vital. Homeowners in the area, represented by the St. Vital Ratepayers Assoc., organized to oppose the cuts in service.However, citing \\"poor road conditions\\" in St.Vital, Beaver permanently discontinued service to the municipality on July 12, 1952. To compensate, Winnipeg Electric offered to pick up the service from Beaver, but that service provided would be minimal at best. In September 1948 Winnipeg Electric Company sold their Winnipeg, Selkirk, and Lake Winnipeg Railway to Beaver Bus Lines for $200,000 and Beaver immediately cancelled the commuter rail route then replaced it with a diesel bus. There were issues at the time of the purchase whether the Union agreement, set to expire in March 1949, could be carried over to the bus line company. By May 1949, Beaver had applied to the Public Utility Board to increase fares between Winnipeg and Selkirk, due to 'tremendous cost' of operating the service. Politicians from the R.M. of St. Andrews, West St. Paul, and the Town of Selkirk said costs should not have increased just because ownership was transferred from Winnipeg Electric to Beaver Bus Lines the year prior. The new fares were approved the next month. Prior to the rate increase, a book of 20 tickets could be purchased for $1.50. Now the fare would jump to 20 tickets for $2.50, an increase of over 86%.Allegations that Winnipeg Electric was being discriminatory to the municipalities that it served in its fares were responded to by Beaver Bus to eliminate unfair fares by adjusting them accordingly. In October 1964, Beaver Bus moved its Winnipeg terminal from the Union Bus Depot on Hargrave St. (now the site of True North Sq.) to the Winnipeg Bus Depot on Balmoral St. (now Winnipeg Transit's Balmoral Station). As of July 1, 2016, Beaver Bus Lines has discontinued this service. Selkirk was connected directly to Winnipeg via a route run by private operator Beaver Bus Lines. The first bus would leave Selkirk at 6:15 AM on weekdays and 7:50 AM on Saturdays. The final departure from Winnipeg would occur at 10:00 PM on weekdays and 6:00 PM on Saturdays. Intermediary destinations along the route include the villages of Lockport and St. Andrews in the RM of St. Andrews and the villages of Middlechurch and Rivercrest in the RM of West St. Paul. The fare was $9 to go from Selkirk to Winnipeg, or $17 for a two-way fare. The Selkirk to Winnipeg service had daily ridership of 400–500, but ridership went down after the City of Selkirk introduced its own transit service, Selkirk Transit, in 2011, so the route was cancelled. Its operations garage was based at 175 Horace Ave. in St. Boniface and later moved to 339 Archibald, also in St. Boniface. ===Exclusive Bus Lines (Discontinued)=== As of July 4th 2016, Exclusive Bus Lines had a route to replace the Beaver Bus Lines route. Buses ran Monday to Friday from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM. Intermediary destinations along the route included the villages of Lockport and St. Andrews in the RM of St. Andrews and the villages of Middlechurch and Rivercrest in the RM of West St. Paul. The fare was $11 to go from Selkirk to Winnipeg, or $20 for a day pass. The fare was reduced for shorter trips. Express buses ran with reduced stops that took 45 minutes, compared to the regular 55 minutes. As of September 1st 2017 this service has been discontinued due to low ridership. ===Kasper Route (Discontinued)=== Kasper Transport took over from Exclusive Bus Lines the Winni;peg-Selkirk commuter bus in September 2017. Kasper offered mini-bus service from Winnipeg to Selkirk. A trip between Selkirk and Winnipeg cost $20, while a discount rate (Seniors/55+) cost $18. Children six and under rode free. On August 20, 2019 Kasper announced that their Winnipeg-Selkirk commuter bus service would be permanently discontinued as they could not make a profit from the few (22 passengers / day) that used the service. Kasper said that they lost C$2,000–3,000 per month and that they needed more than 40 passengers per day to break even. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Selkirk Transit public- transportation Category:Transit agencies in Manitoba Category:Selkirk, Manitoba ","title":"Selkirk Transit"},{"id":"35948945","text":"Heinrich Schurtz (born 11 December 1863 in Zwickau; died 2 May 1903 in Bremen) was a German ethnologist and historian.

He then served as Assistant Under- Secretary of State for the Colonies in London for 20 years. ==Early life== Born on 14 November 1832 in Roxwell, Essex, Bramston was the second son of Thomas William Bramston (later MP for South Essex), of Skreens, Essex and his wife Eliza, daughter of Admiral Sir Eliab Harvey. He was educated at Winchester College and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1854, becoming Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in the following year, and D.C.L. in 1863. He entered the Middle Temple in November 1854 and was called to the bar in June 1857. ==Queensland== He went to Queensland in 1859 as private secretary to Sir George Bowen, the first Governor of Queensland, and held that post for two years, when he resigned. On 3 July 1863 he was appointed as a Member of the Queensland Legislative Council, and was a member without portfolio of the first Ministry formed by his friend Sir Robert Herbert, the first Premier of Queensland, from July 1863 to February 1866, acting briefly as Attorney-General from 31 August 1865 to 11 September 1865. Although his membership of the Legislative Council was a lifetime appointment, Bramston resigned on 17 November 1869. Robert Herbert established a farm in the Brisbane area and lived in the farmhouse with John Bramston. The pair named their house Herston, a combination of their surnames, which eventually became the name of the suburb of Herston. ==England== Subsequently Bramston returned to England, and remained for two years, acting in 1867 as Assistant Boundary Commissioner for Devon and Cornwall under the Reform Act of that year. ==Return to Queensland== Bramston returned to Queensland in 1868. When Charles Haley resigned as Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Burnett, Bramston was elected in the resulting by-election on 3 April 1871. He held the seat until 8 December 1873, when the electorate was abolished in a redistribution. During this time, he was Queensland's Attorney-General in the Palmer Ministry from 3 May 1870 to 2 January 1874. On 12 December 1872 at St John's Cathedral (Brisbane) in Brisbane, Bramston married Eliza Isabella Russell, daughter of Rev. Harry Vane Russell and niece of the Governor of Queensland, George Phipps, 2nd Marquess of Normanby (who had married Laura Russell, sister to Harry Russell). The service was conducted by the Bishop of Brisbane, Edward Tufnell. The Governor hosted a wedding reception at Government House and the couple honeymooned in Sydney and Tasmania. ==Hong Kong== In 1874 Bramston was appointed Attorney General of Hong Kong replacing Julian Pauncefote. From time to time as Attorney General, he also acted as a judge in Hong Kong. ==Return to England== In June 1876 Bramston was appointed as Assistant Under Secretary of State in the Colonial Office, being employed on a mission to Berlin in connection with the Angra Pequena negotiations in July 1886, in which year he was created Companion of the Order of the Bath. In October 1887, Bramston's death was announced in the Queensland newspapers, resulting in the publication of many obituaries. However, it turned out to be an error arising from a misinterpretation of a telegram. John Bramston was appointed Registrar of the Order of St. Michael and St. George in 1892. He served as Assistant Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies for more than 20 years, retiring in 1898 upon which he was created Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). In 1899 he was sent as Royal Commissioner in conjunction with Admiral Sir James Erskine to inquire into French treaty rights in Newfoundland. The dispute was settled by the Entente Cordiale of 1904. Similarly Bramston was a member of the Royal Commission for the Paris Exhibition of 1900. In the 1900 New Year Honours list he was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), and he received the order from Queen Victoria during an investiture at Windsor Castle on 1 March 1900. ==Death== His wife, Lady Bramston, died in 1920. Bramston died at Wimbledon on Tuesday 13 September 1921, and was buried at the Wimbledon Cemetery. ==See also== * Members of the Queensland Legislative Council, 1860–1869 * Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, 1870–1871; 1871-1873 ==ReferencesExternal links== Category:1832 births Category:1921 deaths Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly Category:People educated at Winchester College Category:Alumni of Balliol College, Oxford Category:Members of the Middle Temple Category:British barristers Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:Attorneys General of Hong Kong Category:Members of the Queensland Legislative Council Category:Fellows of All Souls College, Oxford Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Attorneys-General of Queensland Category:Colony of Queensland people Category:People from the City of Chelmsford ","title":"John Bramston (Australian politician)"},{"id":"35948994","text":"Chloroethyl chloroformates (chemical formula: C3H4Cl2O2) are a pair of related chemical compounds.

An album master was compiled on 14 November 1970 although it would remain unreleased. Bootleg releases with the same title collect additional recordings unrelated to this album. ==Background and recording== The final sessions for the Bee Gees' album Cucumber Castle took place on October 16, 1969. Two songs, \\"End of My Song\\" and \\"Julia\\", were recorded but neither were released. Around November 1969, Gibb collaborated with Australian group Tin Tin on which the band recorded \\"Nobody Moves Me Like You\\", \\"Loves Her That Way\\", \\"Flag/Put Your Money On My Dog\\". Although Gibb's plans as a solo artist were accelerating, he was also quoted as saying \\"I'd seriously love to get back to the old Bee Gees again. I really loved the group, and I miss the unit a lot. It's things like sitting in hotel rooms together after a show and taking people off that made working in a group such fun. I miss all that being solo.\\" By December, Gibb began recording songs for a solo album. He said in an interview that he played guitar, bass, piano, organ and Mellotron. Other musicians who played on the album include Leslie Harvey of Stone the Crows and Geoff Bridgford from The Groove who would join the reformed Bee Gees for a short period. The first song recorded was \\"Railroad\\", which was later released as a single however it did not chart in the US or the UK. According to a tape note, the instrumental tracks are played Harvey, with the members of the First Edition including Kenny Rogers. ==Album content== \\"Billy [Lawrie] and I have written a lot of album material\\" Gibb revealed, \\"I will probably be forming a group to work with me. There is something in the air. There will be a few lost friends, but I can't say too much about it.\\" Billy Lawrie later recorded \\"Take It Easy, Greasy\\" but was also not released. \\"She's the One You Love\\" is the only true rock song on The Loner, an album consisting mostly ballads. \\"Laughing Child\\" perhaps similar to his later composition \\"Trafalgar\\" (1971), the title song \\"The Loner\\" was later covered by the Bloomfields for the film Bloomfield. \\"Touch and Understand Love\\" features Gibb's solo voice, with his acoustic guitar with no backup vocals or drumming. Gibb himself was interviewed by Nicky Horne on Radio 1: > \\"My solo LP is one thing that, well, to tell you the truth, I don't think it > should be worth releasing because I did it a while ago, and I was under a > great depression at the time when I did it, because I missed the boys very > much. I just did it because I thought I had to do it.\\" The single \\"Railroad\\" b/w \\"I've Come Back\\" was issued on 17 April 1970 in the UK, and also was issued in the summer of 1970 in several European countries, Japan, the US, Canada and Australia. These are the only tracks officially released from The Loner. ==Track listing== All tracks written and composed by Maurice Gibb and Billy Lawrie. ==Personnel== * Maurice Gibb – lead and backing vocals, guitar, piano, bass, organ, Mellotron * Leslie Harvey – electric guitar * Johnny Coleman – piano * Geoff Bridgford – drums * Gerry Shury – orchestral arrangement ==References== Category:Maurice Gibb albums Category:Unreleased albums ","title":"The Loner (Maurice Gibb album)"},{"id":"35949105","text":"Dialifor (Torak) is an organophosphorus pesticide.

After two weeks, he was offered a job at Gee's shop. Makar accepted the job, and moved from New Jersey to North Carolina. He continued to work at Gee's shop until he was offered a job as a mechanic from Harry Hyde in 1979. Two years later, he was hired by Ron Benfield and Buddy Parrott. Makar spent three years with Benfield and Parrott before he was hired by Junior Johnson. However, after one season, he moved to Blue Max Racing, where he continued to work to 1990. During Rusty Wallace's 1989 championship, Makar was the team's chassis specialist. In 1990, he became a crew chief for the first time. He was the crew chief for Wallace in seven races. During the 1991 season, Makar joined Penske Racing South, where he continued being Wallace's crew chief for 17 races. The combination recorded their first win at Bristol Motor Speedway in the spring. Midway through the season, Makar left Penske to work for Joe Gibbs, who was building a new team around Dale Jarrett, Makar's brother in law.

He became known for his human rights activism after his son, Joelito Filártiga, who was killed by the police during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner in 1976. == Biography == Filártiga was born in Ybytimí, Paraguarí, on 15 August 1932. He studied medicine at the National University of Asunción, and at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. He was a delegate of the Student Center of the Faculty of Medicine before the University Federation of Paraguay, from where he participated in the struggle against the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. Filártiga initially became known for offering health care to poor and indigenous peasants in a clinic that he opened in 1959 in the town of Ybycuí, in Paraguarí. Filártiga also was an artist. Several of his works were part of special presentations in Paraguay and abroad. On 30 March 1976, Filártiga's son, Joelito, aged 17, was killed. Police claimed the murder was the result of a \\"crime of passion\\", committed by a neighborhood's policeman when he caught Joelito with his wife. However, it was later determined that Joelito was kidnapped by the police and tortured since his body exhibited marks of torture. The family Filártiga was opposed to Stroessner's regime, and therefore was persecuted. Filártiga fought for a long time for it to be acknowledged that his son had been murdered. In 1978, one of the main suspects, Américo Norberto Peña Irala, escaped to the United States. A daughter of Filártiga, Dolly, also went to the U.S. seeking exile. When she learned of Peña's presence in the country, the Filártiga family denounced him with the help of the Center for Constitutional Rights. In 1980, the U.S. justice ruled in favor of the Filártiga family, granting them a compensation of US$10.4 million in Filártiga v. Peña-Irala. He was portrayed by Anthony Hopkins in the 1991 television film One Man's War. In November 2018, he was decorated by the Senate of Paraguay, which paid him a tribute for \\"his unwavering fight for health, freedom and justice.\\" Filártiga died on 5 July 2019 at age of 86, in the Social Security Institute Hospital in Asunción. == References == Category:Paraguayan physicians Category:Paraguayan artists Category:1932 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Paraguarí Department Category:Paraguayan human rights activists ","title":"Joel Filártiga"},{"id":"35949168","text":"ν Ceti, Latinized as Nu Ceti, is a binary star system in the equatorial constellation of Cetus.

Upon acquisition of the virus, the virus replicates inside and kills T helper cells, which are required for almost all adaptive immune responses. There is an initial period of influenza-like illness, and then a latent, asymptomatic phase. When the CD4 lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/ml of blood, the HIV host has progressed to AIDS, a condition characterized by deficiency in cell-mediated immunity and the resulting increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and certain forms of cancer. == Immunology == After the virus enters the body there is a period rapid viral replication, leading to an abundance of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the numbers of circulating CD4+ T cells. This acute viremia is associated in virtually all people with the activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts rebound. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus. During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of the immune system to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers. Although the symptoms of immunodeficiency (characteristic of AIDS) do not appear for years after a person is infected, the bulk of CD4+ T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection, especially in the intestinal mucosa, which harbors the majority of the lymphocytes found in the body. The reason for the preferential loss of mucosal CD4+ T cells is that a majority of mucosal CD4+ T cells express the CCR5 coreceptor, whereas a small fraction of CD4+ T cells in the bloodstream do so. HIV seeks out and destroys CCR5 expressing CD4+ cells during acute infection. A vigorous immune response eventually controls the infection and initiates the clinically latent phase. However, CD4+ T cells in mucosal tissues remain depleted throughout the infection, although enough remain to initially ward off life-threatening infections. Continuous HIV replication results in a state of generalized immune activation persisting throughout the chronic phase. Immune activation, which is reflected by the increased activation state of immune cells and release of proinflammatory cytokines, results from the activity of several HIV gene products and the immune response to ongoing HIV replication. Another cause is the breakdown of the immune surveillance system of the mucosal barrier caused by the depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells during the acute phase of disease. This results in the systemic exposure of the immune system to microbial components of the gut’s normal flora, which in a healthy person is kept in check by the mucosal immune system. The activation and proliferation of T cells that results from immune activation provides fresh targets for HIV infection. However, direct killing by HIV alone cannot account for the observed depletion of CD4+ T cells since only 0.01–0.10% of CD4+ T cells in the blood are infected. A major cause of CD4+ T cell loss appears to result from their heightened susceptibility to apoptosis when the immune system remains activated. Although new T cells are continuously produced by the thymus to replace the ones lost, the regenerative capacity of the thymus is slowly destroyed by direct infection of its thymocytes by HIV. Eventually, the minimal number of CD4+ T cells necessary to maintain a sufficient immune response is lost, leading to AIDS. == CD4 T-cell Death and Inflammation == Recent studies employed an ex vivo human lymphoid aggregate culture (HLAC) system formed with fresh human tonsil or spleen tissue to model molecular and cellular events in human tissues during in vivo HIV infection. These studies found that >95% of CD4 T cells die because of abortive HIV infection. These dying cells are resting and thus are nonpermissive for productive HIV infection. Full viral replication was limited to the ∼5% of activated CD4 T cells present in these tissues; these cells die by apoptosis. Abortive HIV infection occurs due to slowing of reverse transcription promoting cytosolic DNA accumulation. This viral DNA is sensed by gamma-interferon-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), which produces an innate immune response against the virus by activating caspase 1 in IFI16 inflammasomes and inducing pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death. These findings cast CD4 T-cell death during HIV infection in a different light. Rather than the virus playing a major role, it is the host response to viral DNA produced during abortive infection that triggers CD4 T-cell death. Further, these findings identify novel drug targets that may be exploited to both block CD4 T cell demise and the chronic inflammatory response generated during pyroptosis. == Cells affected == The virus, entering through which ever route, acts primarily on the following cells: * Lymphoreticular system: ** CD4\\\\+ T-Helper cells (main target cell) ** Macrophages ** Monocytes * Certain endothelial cells * Central nervous system: ** Microglia of the nervous system ** Astrocytes ** Oligodendrocytes ** Neurones – indirectly by the action of cytokines and the gp-120 == The effect == Although the virus has cytopathic effects in productively infected cells, this effect may not directly contribute to HIV pathogenesis (see above). Importantly, the virus can remain inactive (latent) in these productively infected cells for long periods. * CD4 T-cell depletion and chronic inflammation are the two signature events that drive HIV pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. * Infection of the cells of the CNS cause acute aseptic meningitis, subacute encephalitis, vacuolar myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Later it leads to even AIDS dementia complex. * The CD4-gp120 interaction (see above) is also permissive to other viruses like Cytomegalovirus, Hepatitis virus, Herpes simplex virus, etc. These viruses lead to further cell damage i. e. cytopathy. == Molecular basis == For details, see: * Structure and genome of HIV * HIV replication cycle * HIV tropism ==References== Category:HIV/AIDS HIV AIDS ","title":"Pathophysiology of HIV/AIDS"},{"id":"35949216","text":"Hon.

The 6'3\\" Palzer, who was German-American, fought in the heavyweight division at a weight of 218 to 228 lbs. Palzer was one of the first boxers to fight for the World White Heavyweight Championship title. ==Biography== He was born on 1 January 1890. On 9 March 1911, he lost a newspaper decision to Frank Moran in a 10-round bout held in Brooklyn, New York. Moran had fought Johnson in a four-round exhibition in April 1909 in Pittsburgh and later lost a title match with Johnson in Paris on 27 Jun 1914. Palzer participated in a \\"White Hope\\" tournament organized by promoter Tom O'Rourke at New York City's National Sporting Club that was held in May 1911. Ironically, O’Rourke has managed the legendary African American boxers Joe Walcott and George Dixon. He also had signed Palzer to a contract before the tournament, and likely manipulated it so that Palzer could win. Other White Hope tournaments were created in response to O'Rouke's contest. On 19 December 1911, Palzer fought Al Kaufman in Brooklyn and scored a K.O. in the fifth round of their 10-round bout. Kaufman had fought Jack Johnson for the world heavyweight title in San Francisco on 9 September 1909. The 10-rounder ended in a no-decision, and the two fighters met in Reno, Nevada to box an exhibition in July 1910. On New Year's Day 1913, Palzer met Luther McCarty in Vernon, California to determine the \\"White Heavyweight Championship\\" of the world. McCarty won the title by way of a T.K.O. in the 18th round. It would be a title he would hold for the rest of his life which would only be a short five months. Palzer retired in 1915 after having racked up a record of nine wins (six by K.O.) against four losses. He also lost four newspaper decisions.

However, the Lakers struggled losing 19 of their final 30 games in March and April, finishing fifth in the Pacific Division with a 39–43 record, their worst since 1974–75, but still qualified the playoffs as the #8 seed in the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they took a 2–0 series lead over the top-seeded Phoenix Suns. However, they would lose the series in five games. Following the season, A.C. Green signed as an unrestricted free agent with the Phoenix Suns, Byron Scott signed with the Indiana Pacers, and Benjamin was dealt to the New Jersey Nets. ==Draft picks== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" - ! 5c2f83; color:#fcb926; width:10%;\\" Round ! 5c2f83; color:#fcb926; width:10%;\\" Pick ! 5c2f83; color:#fcb926; width:20%;\\" Player ! 5c2f83; color:#fcb926; width:15%;\\" Position ! 5c2f83; color:#fcb926; width:15%;\\" Nationality ! 5c2f83; color:#fcb926; width:20%;\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  15  Anthony Peeler  SG   Missouri - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  2  36  Duane Cooper  PG   Southern California } ==RosterRegular seasonSeason standings=== :z – clinched division title :y – clinched division title :x – clinched playoff spot ===Record vs. opponents=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=281992-93 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !008080;color:#800080;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000080;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"CLE !008000;color:#00008B;width=35\\"DAL !0000CD;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"DEN !0000FF;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"DET !0000FF;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"GSW !FF0000;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !006400;color:#B22222;width=35\\"MIL !0000FF;color:#228B22;width=35\\"MIN !DC143C;color:#0000CD;width=35\\"NJN !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !0000FF;color:#000000;width=35\\"ORL !FF0000;color:#0000FF;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !0000FF;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#FFC322;width=35\\"SEA !36004A;color:#FFFF00;width=35\\"UTA !DC143C;color:#0000CD;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  2–2  3–2  2–2  0–5  1–1  2–0  2–3  2–0  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  3–1  3–2  2–0  1–3  2–2  1–3  3–1  0–2  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  2–0  2–2 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Boston  2–2  —  3–1  1–3  3–1  2–0  2–0  1–3  2–0  1–1  2–2  1–1  1–1  3–1  2–2  2–0  4–0  1–4  3–2  4–1  0–2  2–0  1–1  1–1  0–2  0–2  4–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Charlotte  2–3  1–3  —  2–3  1–3  2–0  1–1  4–1  2–0  0–2  0–5  1–1  1–1  2–2  3–1  2–0  2–2  1–3  3–1  4–0  0–2  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  4–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Chicago  2–2  3–1  3–2  —  2–3  2–0  1–1  3–1  2–0  0–2  5–0  2–0  0–2  3–1  4–1  2–0  4–0  1–3  3–1  2–2  1–1  2–0  2–0  0–2  2–0  2–0  4–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Cleveland  5–0  1–3  3–1  3–2  —  2–0  1–1  3–2  2–0  1–1  4–0  1–1  2–0  2–2  4–1  2–0  2–2  1–3  2–2  4–0  2–0  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–1  3–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Dallas  1–1  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  —  1–5  1–1  0–4  1–4  1–1  0–4  1–3  0–2  0–2  1–4  0–2  0–2  1–1  1–1  0–4  0–4  0–4  0–5  1–3  0–5  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Denver  0–2  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  5–1  —  1–1  3–1  2–3  1–1  2–2  1–3  0–2  1–1  3–2  1–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  1–3  1–3  3–1  1–4  1–3  2–3  2–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Detroit  3–2  3–1  1–4  1–3  2–3  1–1  1–1  —  0–2  1–1  3–2  1–1  1–1  1–3  2–2  1–1  3–1  2–2  3–1  3–1  0–2  1–1  2–0  0–2  0–2  0–2  4–0 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Golden State  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  0–2  4–0  1–3  2–0  —  2–2  0–2  2–3  1–4  2–0  1–1  3–1  1–1  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–4  0–5  4–1  3–1  1–4  3–1  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Houston  1–1  1–1  2–0  2–0  1–1  4–1  3–2  1–1  2–2  —  2–0  4–0  3–1  2–0  1–1  4–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  2–0  2–2  1–3  4–0  4–1  1–3  4–1  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Indiana  2–2  2–2  5–0  0–5  0–4  1–1  1–1  2–3  2–0  0–2  —  1–1  1–1  2–2  2–3  1–1  3–1  1–3  2–2  3–1  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  2–0  0–2  3–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  L.A.

AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 11 日 The spectroscopic binary nature of Xi1 Ceti was discovered in 1901 by William Wallace Campbell using the Mills spectrograph at the Lick Observatory. The primary Ceti A is a G6III or G8III clump-giant star. The spectroscopic binary companion star is an A2V dwarf of about 2 solar masses and 30 luminosity. It is separated at 0.012 arcsec so in an orbit of 4.2 AU, smaller than the distance between Jupiter and the Sun. Xi1 Ceti A exhibits characteristics similar to an eclipsing binary, with a small white dwarf companion. Occultations with the moon have not yet confirmed the existence of the second suspected companion. However, component A is a barium star which would tend to confirm this unseen component. == References External links== *http://server3.wikisky.org/starview?object_type=1&object;_id=979 *http://www.alcyone.de/cgi-bin/search.pl?object=HR0649 Category:G-type giants Category:Barium stars Category:Spectroscopic binaries Category:Cetus (constellation) Ceti, Xi1 Category:Durchmusterung objects Ceti, 65 013611 010324 0649 ","title":"Xi1 Ceti"},{"id":"35949377","text":"The 1989–90 NBA season was the Lakers' 42nd season in the National Basketball Association, and 30th in the city of Los Angeles.1989-90 Los Angeles Lakers Despite the retirement of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and an NBA Finals defeat in which they were swept in four games by the Detroit Pistons, the Lakers got off to a fast start winning ten of their first eleven games, on their way finishing the regular season with a league-best 63–19 record. However, after defeating the Houston Rockets in four games in the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers were upset in the Western Conference Semifinals by the 5th-seeded Phoenix Suns in five games. It was the first time in nine years that the Lakers did not reach the Western Conference Finals, ending a run that started in 1981—the longest series of consecutive NBA Conference Finals appearances since Bill Russell's Boston Celtics in 1969. Ninth-year head coach Pat Riley resigned after the season and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy. He would return to coach the New York Knicks for the 1991–92 season. Following the season, Orlando Woolridge was traded to the Denver Nuggets. Magic Johnson won the league's MVP trophy—his third in four years—in a controversial voting over Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers.

The cephalothorax is coloured dark brown and is shaped rectangular and flattened. The abdomen tends to be patterned with grey-brown and orange colours. When fully mature, males have a yellow clypeal band that resembles a mustache. Females do not have this feature. Males also have a slimmer body and longer frontal legs. Male Trite auricoma with \\"mustache\\" that identifies it as a male. == Taxonomy == Trite auricoma was first described by Arthur T. Urquhart in 1886 as Attus auricomus (Urquhart, 1886). Urquhart proceeded to unknowingly describe T. auricoma synonyms several times as Plexippus capillatus, Attus suffuscus, Attus kirkii and Attus adustus in 1890 and 1893, respectively. Independently, in 1917, Raymond Comte de Dalmas described another synonym, Trite vafra, from samples he collected with Eugène Simon after visiting New Zealand from 1912-1913. In 1935, after examining type specimens from Canterbury Muesum, Elizabeth Bangs Bryant placed A. auricomus in the Trite genus and renamed the species as T. auricoma. Bryant also recognized P. capillatus, A. suffuscus, A. kirkii, A. adustus and T. vafra as synonyms of T. auricoma. == Etymology == In Latin, the species name \\"auricoma\\" translates to \\"gold hair\\" (\\"auri\\" translates to gold, \\"coma\\" translates to hair). This is likely a reference to the gold-brown colour of the spider. == Distribution and habitat == Trite auricoma is widely distributed throughout New Zealand. T. auricoma can often be found in rolled up leaves of flax (Phormium) or underneath dropped cabbage tree (Cordyline) leaves. T. auricoma can also be found underneath stones, in vegetation and also on the ground. == Diet == Like all spiders, Trite auricoma is an obligate carnivore. In experimental conditions, juvenile T. auricoma has been observed feeding on aphids and small flies such as Drosophilia. In experimental conditions, T. auricoma were more selective about prey choice, and fed on small flies and tachnids. T. auricoma also have to learn what is good to eat. It has been reported that juveniles will only eat slaters once, but then never again. == Behaviour  Hunting === Like most salticidae, Trite auricoma is a visual predator. If there is a fly within 15 cm of the front of the spider, the spider becomes alert. In the first stage, the legs and abdomen are shifted and straightened. The hind legs then become drawn in and the spider begins to slowly move towards the prey. Once the spider is 3–4 cm from its prey, it leaps and pierces the prey with its fangs. If a fly or other prey appears behind the spider, the spider will turn around and begin stalking. If the prey moves during stalking, the spider will turn its cephalothorax so that it is pointed at the prey. The abdomen will then also be moved into line with the cephalothorax and stalking will be resumed. If the prey begins to flee, then the spider will give chase and pounce. Hunger is thought to initiate hunting behaviour. Juvenile T. auricoma must learn to perfect the movements required in hunting. Juveniles usually miss their prey the first few times they hunt. === Interactions with conspecifics === The spiderlings of T. auricoma do not react to each other while they are in the egg sac. However, once they have emerged, confrontations between juveniles result in one or both spiders raising their front legs. At this point, both spiders back away. == Parasites == Trite auricoma has been observed being parasitized by Priocnemis nitidiventris, which paralyses the spider and feeds it to its young. ==References== Category:Salticidae Category:Spiders of New Zealand Category:Spiders described in 1886 Category:Endemic fauna of New Zealand ","title":"Trite auricoma"},{"id":"35949487","text":"Rho Ceti , Latinized from ρ Ceti, is the Bayer designation for a star in the equatorial constellation of Cetus.

He was the first Registrar of the Permanent Court of International Justice, serving from 1922 to 1936, when he was elected to the position of judge to the same court. He served in the latter position until his death. ==Life== Åke Hammarskjöld was born in 1893 in Uppsala. He studied at the University of Uppsala for a career in the foreign service. During the First World War, he was a member of a committee of the Swedish government which worked out the basis for Sweden's participation in the legal organization of the postwar order. After the war, he served as secretary of the delegation of his country at the Paris Peace Conference. From 1920 he worked in the secretariat of the newly formed League of Nations in drafting the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice and organizing the first elections of judges to the court. In 1922 he was appointed Registrar of the court by the Secretary General of the League of Nations. In 1936 he taught as a lecturer at the Hague Academy of International Law. On October 8 of the same year he was elected as a judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice. He died nine months later in The Hague, at the age of 44. His father, Hjalmar Hammarskjöld, was the Prime Minister of Sweden from 1914 to 1917.

Top: reconstructed view of the interior; bottom: plan of excavation, showing locations of wall trenches (pink), central columns (brown), hearth (red), and beaker and glass bowl (green). Sven Rosborn (2006) Remains of an Iron Age building interpreted as the possible remains of a temple were excavated in Uppåkra, south of Lund in Scania, Sweden, from 2000-2004.Kulthuset , Uppåkra - en forntida centralort, 2007, retrieved April 21, 2010 (Swedish). The building was rebuilt six times on the same floor plan, on the site of an older (3rd century) longhouse, and was likely in existence during the 6th to 10th centuries. It measured 13 by 6,5 meters (33 ft x 16.5 ft) and had three doors. The central part was elevated and supported by four pillars. Lars Larsson (2007) argued that the find represents \\"the first Scandinavian building for which the term 'temple' can be justly claimed\\". ==Building== The remains of the building consist of holes and trenches for the placement of the pillars and walls that once stood there. Various floor levels were discernible, and it was possible to determine that the building was originally erected in the 3rd century on the site of an unusually large longhouse, and then rebuilt six times without appreciable changes, the last version of the building dating to the early Viking Age.Lars Larsson, \\"The Iron Age ritual building at Uppåkra, southern Sweden,\\" Antiquity 81 (2007), 11-25, pp. 14-15. The building material was in all cases wood, which was also sunk into the ground. The building was 13 meters long and 6.5 meters wide. The walls on the long sides were made of slightly convex, rough-cut oak posts or \\"staves,\\" which were sunk into a trench in the earth more than one meter deep. At each corner of the building stood a pillar or corner-post. The central part of the building, which stood free of the outer walls, was formed by four gigantic wooden columns. The holes for these and for the corner-posts are unusually wide and more than two meters deep, and stone packing found in three of the center holes indicates columns at least 0.7 meters in diameter. The building had three entrances, two in the south and one in the north. Each opening had hefty posts on either side, and the southwestern had a projecting section in addition.Larsson, p. 13. That must therefore have been the main entrance of the hof. This has been interpreted as the men's entrance, the entrance on the north side as the women's entrance, and the southeastern entrance as for the priest, on the model of stone churches.Uppåkra - Hednatemplet i Uppåkra, Bengans historiasidor, May 23, 2008, retrieved April 20, 2010. Two large iron door rings were found, one in the fill around a post, the other about 10 meters from the building.Larsson, p. 17. The outer walls of the building were of so-called stave-construction, as in palisade churches and later stave churches, with strong corner posts. The technique can be recognized from the preserved remnants of palisade churches in Lund dating to about 1050. The tops of the vertical posts or staves must have been slotted into a horizontal log or wall plate, called a lejd in Swedish (stavlægje in Norwegian), which was seated on the corner posts. The deep trench in which the staves were sunk together with the deep holes for the corner posts indicate that the outer walls must have been high. The purpose of the holes was to resist the lateral pressures so that the walls did not collapse. In Hemse stave church, Gotland, wall staves three meters long were found preserved from the early timber church. An above-ground height of up to four meters for the outer walls of the hof is therefore not impossible. ===Reconstructions=== Two reconstructions of the hof at Uppåkra, Sweden. Top: Lunda; bottom: Foteviken Reconstructions of the appearance of the hof at Uppåkra have assumed it looked like a stave church. In 2004 the Foteviken Museum published a reconstruction with the four central columns interpreted as the framework for a tower. The roof was clad in wood shakes, which indicate a fairly steep roof. From the side wall to the tower wall, there must have been a rise of a good two meters. The two-meter-deep postholes indicate a very strong construction, not least since the four columns formed a square, which made possible effective cross- bracing (as depicted in the above illustration). With a suggested height of ten meters for its columns, the roof of the tower would have protruded a full three meters over the roof ridge of the nave. A second reconstruction, Lunda, was published in 2006. In the latter, the artist opted not to interpret the imposing dimensions of the four central columns and the tremendous depth to which they were sunk in terms of a tower, but instead to extend the outer walls up to a tremendous height, almost six meters. The two interpretations are represented together for comparison here. ==Associated finds== In the wall trenches and the post holes, the excavators found roughly two hundred so- called gullgubber, the most found at any site in Sweden. These are small pieces of gold foil with incised human figures. Their size indicates that these cannot have served as examples of gold for trade without having a connection to religious worship. Finding such large numbers of them where the posts and walls of the Uppåkra hof stood indicates that they were offered in association with the erection of the temple. Those found at Uppåkra resemble those found at the Sorte Muld (\\"black earth\\") site on the Danish island of Bornholm, some even being made from the same molds. Most of them depict male figures, a smaller number depict females, and a few depict male-female couples.Larsson, pp. 16, 18. North of the building, a large number of weapons were found, many of them deliberately broken like the offerings left in Danish bogs. Spear-points were most numerous, followed by fragmented shields. They had been placed on top of layers of stones, and with them were bones, some human. Some weaponry was also found south of the building. It is possible that these had previously been stored in the hof.Larsson, pp. 19, 22. Immediately beyond the west end of the building was a concentration of fire-cracked stones and animal bones; there was a paved area just south of it, southwest of the building. A few meters further to the west there had been a small building; a gold bracteate was found on a collapsed clay wall. Inside the Uppåkra hof was a fireplace, near which a bronze and silver beaker, a glass bowl, and shards of about ten other glass vessels were found buried in the floor. The beaker, dated to approximately 500 C.E., is approximately 20 cm high and decorated with bands of thin gold leaf embossed with designs of humans, snakes, and horses. The bowl, roughly contemporary, is made of a clear layer of glass with a cobalt blue glass overlay cut through in a rosette pattern and comes from the region north of the Black Sea.Larsson, pp. 14, 16-17. Numerous other objects - fibulae, beads, potsherds, gold fragments - of varying dates were found in the various floor layers, suggesting a continuous tradition of offerings, and there were signs of the manufacture of gold objects near the building.Larsson, pp. 16, 17. ==Settlement== To the east of the building there had been several longhouses and firepits at different times, and several grindstones were also found buried in an almost straight line, some smashed and others intact. These may have been offerings or have supported pillars.Larsson, pp. 20-21. The building is near the center of the settlement and there are at least four burial mounds to the west and north of it, probably dating to the early Bronze Age or the early Iron Age.Larsson, p. 21. ==See also== * Heathen hof * Temple at Uppsala == References External links== *The Uppåkra Temple (virtualhistory.se) Category:Archaeological sites in Sweden Category:Germanic archaeological sites ","title":"Uppåkra temple"},{"id":"35949560","text":"The Battle of Estepona was a naval battle that occurred in the year 1342 between the armada of the Crown of Aragon, commanded by Admiral Pere de Montcada, against the fleet of the Marinid Dynasty.

The origin of his family and of his name was the town Boskovich in Moravia. In Cluj, Boskovich studied in a Jewish high school called \\"Culture\\" which accommodated both Neolog and Orthodox Jews. In 1920, Alexander joined the local Jewish organization \\"Hashomer\\" in which he was active for four years. In 1937, Boskovich sent a piano version of his work \\"The Golden Chain\\" to the conductor Issay Dobrowen. This work, based on Jewish songs from the Carpathian Mountains, was originally written for piano and later on, in 1936, transcribed for orchestra. In 1938, Dobrowen suggested to the \\"Palestinian Orchestra\\" to embed this work in a concert under his baton. Boskovich was invited (from abroad) to the premiere of his composition \\"Jewish Folk Songs\\" which was performed by the newly founded Palestinian (Jewish) Orchestra. (Later on, that orchestra evolved into the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.) One consequence of that event was that Boskovich decided to stay in the country and settle in Tel Aviv. In the coming years, Boskovich often said that Dobrowen, \\"The Golden Chain\\", and the orchestra's invitation saved his life. One of the cornerstones in the development of the art of music in Palestine during the Yishuv period was the performance of Boskovich's Semitic Suite by the Histadrut Orchestra under the baton of Frank Pelleg. Immediately after his arrival in Israel, Boskovich changed his writing style as is well manifested by his Semitic Suite---from the tonality of Europe into textures that imitated the Oud or the Arab Kanun. Writing in the Land of Israel had a profound effect on Boskovich; effect of the varied country's landscapes, the colors of sand and sea, and the sounds of the local music that originated from the various Jewish ethnic groups, as well as from the non-Jewish ones. All of these influences inspired him to develop a personal style peculiar only to himself. Penetrating deep into the Hebrew language served him as one of the most inspiring sources. Unlike others, he did not use songs or dances of the various Jewish ethnicities for a direct source, but rather formed his new ideas based on them. That approach prompted him to compose his violin Concerto---his first major work since 1942 which won the Bronisław Huberman's first prize. Later on in 1944, it was performed by The violinist Lorand Ervin Fenyves, George Singer conducting. Despite its success, Boskovich lost interest in this Concerto and, in 1957, he re- wrote its middle section as a separate piece for violin and piano. During the same period (1943), he also wrote his Concerto for oboe and Orchestra which also shows a strong oriental influence.Cohen, Shem. pp. 110–111. In the 1940s and the early 1950s, Boskovich formulated and advocated the concept of Mediterranean Music. The Mediterranean Sea in his opinion represented a new authentic cradle that merged Zionism with the landscape and climate of the East. Boskovich loved the Opera, he loved everything French, such as Ravel's music and French art, while he equally loved the Jewish melodies of Eastern Europe. But in Israel---he felt and preached---everything must start afresh--- perhaps requiring the abandonment of all the old loves and passions. ==Compositions== Boskovich's two key Eretz Israel works, Concerto for Oboe and orchestra and the Semitic Suite, were strongly inspired by the music of Yardena Cohen. The Suite represents most everything that he had aspired to: fragmented improvisational Middle-Eastern motives and piano that sounds like string instruments or Middle-Eastern percussion. This piece served as a model for a whole generation of students. His work includes the Concerto for violin, the Cantata Bat Israel, and the Concerto da Camera. Songs of Ascent (1960) was based on the Bible, for spiritual and language effects, and on the Kabbalah for depth and mythical tone. The primary theme of this work is of a Yemenite character. There are no European traditions nor Mediterranean style in it; the orchestration and rhythms are derived from the sounds of Hebrew words. The Cantata Beth Israel (1960) is written on the basis of Hayim Nahman Bialik's song of the same title. The lyrics are primarily for a tenor soloist, while the chorus sings verses from the Song of Songs and from the Shabbat prayers. Bialik's text music is written in a modern style, almost Surrealistic, while music to the traditional text is written in an archaic style. This synthesis of styles successfully solved the conflict between the Ashkenazi intonation and accent of Bialik's lyrics and the Sephardic poetry of the emphatically biblical text. \\"Be-Adiim\\" (in your ornamental Jewelry), for flute and orchestra, is an instrumental rendition of the Yemenite version of the Songs of Israel related to the splitting of the Red Sea.Cohen, Shem. Am Oved (in Hebrew). p. 113. Boskovich also composed the song Dudu to the words of Haim Hefer which was one of the greatest hits of the 1947–1949 Palestine war. This music, in essence, contradicts everything Boskovich had been preaching. It is flowing and is saturated with tragic memories of the Jewish Eastern-European history; its harmonics are almost romantic. With Dudu, it seemed as if Boskovich's Semitic tone at once disappeared, and nothing remained of his preaching voice. ==Students and Private Life== Alexander Boskovich had many students: young composers of his own generation as well as older ones. Among his students were Rami Bar-Niv, Max Brod (Orchestration), Ezekiel Braun, Theodore Holdheim, Yoram Papourish, Isaac Sedai, Tzevi Snunit, Habib Touma, Yehuda Yannay and David Zahavi. Alexander Boskovich was married to Miriam who was a musician in her own right; she taught piano at the music academy in Tel Aviv. After his death, in Tel Aviv,http://web.nli.org.il/sites/NLI/English/music/news/Pages/Boskovich_105.aspx?PageVersion=512& she cataloged their estate and contributed his manuscripts to the Archive of Israeli Music at the Tel Aviv University. Boskovich was a heavy smoker; he used to say: \\"One who doesn't smoke is no composer.\\" His son David Boskovich is a painter. ==Awards== * '1942 '- Huberman Award for the Violin Concerto * '1946 '- Engel Award ==References== Category:Jewish classical musicians Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israeli composers Category:Israeli musicians Category:Israel Prize in music recipients Category:Jewish classical composers Category:Romanian emigrants to Mandatory Palestine Category:Jews in Mandatory Palestine Category:1907 births Category:1964 deaths Category:20th-century classical composers Category:Male classical composers Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Alexander Uriah Boskovich"},{"id":"35949803","text":"The Makola Muslim Orphanage, a non-profit institution, has been in existence since 1962.

He commanded No. 22 Squadron in combat during the New Guinea campaign, and subsequently took over No. 14 Squadron which was stationed near Perth, Western Australia. He was killed in a flying accident on 6 January 1944, and one of the RAAF's bases was later named in his honour. ==Death== On 6 January 1944, Learmonth led a formation of three No. 14 Squadron Bristol Beauforts on an exercise off Rottnest Island with ships of the US Navy. At a height of and about north-west of Rottnest Island his Beaufort began to shake violently. The Australian-built Beauforts were plagued by a mysterious problem that had destroyed over 90 aircraft and killed many crews, including many under training at RAAF East Sale. Learmonth recognised that the violent shaking was driven by the tail of his aircraft and he called Flight Lieutenant Ken Hewitt, the pilot of one of the other Beauforts, to fly in close and observe his tail. Hewitt could see the control rod to the elevator trim tab on Learmonth’s Beaufort, hanging down. It had separated from the tab, allowing the tab and elevator to oscillate and drive the violent shaking of the whole aircraft. Learmonth used his radio to advise the crews of the other two Beauforts what he was observing. Shortly afterwards, the trim tab flicked to the extreme up position, over-powering Learmonth and forcing the aircraft to descend rapidly. After less than a minute Learmonth’s Beaufort crashed into the sea, killing Learmonth and his three crew members. The wireless operator on one of the other Beauforts reported sighting a parachute on the surface of the water.Sydney Morning Herald - 10 January 1944,p.6 Retrieved 2011-11-14The West Australian – 18 January 1954, p.3 Retrieved 2011-11-02Crash of a Beaufort bomber Retrieved 2011-11-02 With the information obtained from Learmonth’s radio commentary the problem plaguing the Australian-built Beauforts was traced to a component in the elevator trim tab actuating unit. All the RAAF Beauforts were grounded until they were modified to eliminate the problem. Learmonth is credited with supplying the vital information that was necessary to identify the problem and eventually solve it. A secret World War II landing field at Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, known only by the code-name Potshot, was eventually developed into a permanent military base and named RAAF Learmonth in honour of Wing Commander Charles Learmonth. == References == ;Notes ;Bibliography * Category:1917 births Category:1944 deaths Category:Australian aviators Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar (United Kingdom) Category:Royal Australian Air Force personnel of World War II ","title":"Charles Learmonth"},{"id":"35950234","text":"Devpost (formerly ChallengePost) is a platform that helps software engineers participate in software competitions (hackathons).

During their military engagements they often fulfilled the role of a supporting power, especially in the 17th century. In the 18th century Prussia began to adopt an independent role in the conflicts of that time; at the latest by the time of the Silesian Wars. Prussia's Army won major victories, for example, in the Battle of Leuthen, Battle of Leipzig or Battle of Königgrätz, but suffered devastating defeats, for example, in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt. This article lists all the wars and battles in which Brandenburg-Prussia and the Kingdom of Prussia were militarily engaged in, covering the period from 1618 to 1871. == Wars  First Northern War (1656–1660) === The First Northern War (also Second or Little Northern War) was a conflict that took place from 1655 to 1661 between Poland, Sweden and Russia for supremacy in the Baltic states. Brandenburg fought initially on the side of Sweden against Poland, but changed sides, after Poland granted its prince-elector sovereignty over the Duchy of Prussia in the Treaty of Wehlau on 19 September 1657. Brandenburg succeeded in gaining ultimate sovereignty over the Duchy of Prussia and proved itself during the war as an important military and political power. {  ! Battle ! Date ! Remarks -  width=\\"20%\\"  Battle of Warsaw  width=\\"15%\\"  28–30 July 1656  width=\\"65%\\"In this battle the Brandenburg army, together with Sweden, defeated the far larger Polish–Crimean Tartar army. } === Swedish-Brandenburg War (1674–1679) === The Swedish-Brandenburg War was part of the Franco-Dutch War, and was a conflict between the Electorate of Brandenburg and Kingdom of Sweden for the domination of Pomerania. In this war, Sweden was an ally of France, whilst Brandenburg-Prussia, together with Austria, Denmark and Spain, fought on the side of the Dutch. At the end of 1674, Swedish troops invaded Brandenburg, but were successfully repulsed by the Brandenburg army. {  ! Battle ! Date ! Remarks -  width=\\"20%\\"  Battle of Rathenow  width=\\"15%\\"  15 June 1675  width=\\"65%\\"  Brandenburg troops won the first battle of the Swedish-Brandenburg War by ousting the Swedish garrison at Rathenow. -  Battle of Nauen  17 June 1675  The Battle of Nauen was fought between the Brandenburg-Prussian vanguard and Swedish rearguard on the assembly areas of the Battle of Fehrbellin that took place the following day. -  Battle of Fehrbellin  18 June 1675  The battle was a rearguard action, in which Brandenburg decisively defeated the Swedish army. -  Great Sleigh Drive  Winter 1678  A clever manoeuvre by Frederick William, which drove Sweden out of Brandenburg-Prussia again. } === Great Turkish War (1683–1699) === {  ! Battle ! Date ! Remarks - width=\\"20%\\" Siege of Buda width=\\"15%\\" mid-June – 2 September 1686 width=\\"65%\\" A 74,000 man Christian force (including 8,000 Brandenburg troops) besieged the (Turkish) Hungarian capital of Buda (German: Ofen) in mid-June 1686. A Turkish Army came to relieve Buda in mid-August, but its commander shied away from a major attack on the victorious army. As a result, on 2 September 1686, the fortifications were successfully stormed. } === Spanish War of Succession (1701–1714) === In the Crown Treaty signed on 16 November 1700, Elector Frederick III had undertaken to provide a body of 8,000 men for the impending Spanish War of Succession for Emperor Leopold I. In return, the emperor promised that Frederick's future self-coronation as \\"King in Prussia\\" would be recognised across Europe and the Holy Roman Empire. The coronation took place on 18 January 1701 in Königsberg and from April 1701 the now entitled Royal Prussian Contingent deployed to the Lower Rhine at Wesel. In April 1702 it took part in hostilities for the first time at the Siege of Kaiserswerth. {  ! Battle ! Date ! Remarks - width=\\"20%\\"  First Battle of Höchstädt width=\\"15%\\"  20 September 1703 width=\\"65%\\"  French and Bavarian troops won a convincing victory over a force of Austrian and imperial troops under Count Styrum. Only the resistance of Prussian units (6,000 men) under Leopold I of Anhalt-Dessau prevented the complete disintegration of the Austrian and imperial formations. -  Second Battle of Höchstädt  13 August 1704  Units of the Prussian Army (9,000 men) fought successfully in the imperial army under the command of Louis William of Baden together with allied English-Dutch troops against the French army. -  Battle of Cassano  16 August 1705  A French army defeated an Austrian–Prussian force. The Prussian contingent was badly decimated in this battle by the actions of the Austrians, nevertheless Prussia was able to ease the pressured on the besieged city of Turin, enabling the city to hold out until it was relieved. -  Battle of Turin  7 September 1706  An allied Army, consisting of Austrians, Prussian (under the leadership of Leopold I of Anhalt-Dessau) and Italians, broke the Siege of Turin by the French and forced the French to withdraw fully from North Italy. -  Battle of Oudenaarde  11 July 1708  A 70,000 strong army from Prussia, Britain and the Dutch Republic, under the command of Eugen of Savoy and the Duke of Marlborough defeated the French at Oudenaarde in Belgium. - Battle of Malplaquet  11 September 1709  Prussian troops fought and were victorious as part of an allied army, consisting of Austrians, Dutch and British, against the French. This battle resulted in very high losses for the allies. } === Great Northern War (1700–1721) === After the death of his father, King Frederick William I joined the coalition against the Swedish king, Charles XII, with the aim of capturing the Swedish territories in Pomerania. As a result, the Prussian occupied Stettin in 1713. In November 1714, when Charles XII took personal command of Swedish Pomerania, the Prussian Army, together with the Saxons and Danes, was able to force him back to Stralsund in 1715–16 during the Pomeranian campaign and besiege him there. After the end of the war Prussia gained Stettin, Usedom and all territories south of the Peene. {  ! Battle ! Date !

Because Prussia allied itself with Bavaria, France, Saxony, the Electorate of Cologne, Spain, Sweden and Naples, whilst Prussia's main enemy, Austria allied itself with Great Britain, Sardinia, the Netherlands and Russia. For Prussia, the war was restricted to Silesia, and was able to capture the province after several victories. {  ! Battle ! Date !

Although both sides made serious military blunders in the course of the battle (it was Frederick's first), Frederick II succeeded in gaining victory. -  Battle of Lesch  16 February 1742  -  Battle of Chotusitz  17 May 1742  In this battle on 17 May 1742, 23,500 Prussians under Frederick II were victorious over 28,000 Austrians under Prince Charles of Lorraine. The latter wanted to ambush the Prussians, but found them in battle formation. His left flank was attacked by Frederick II and beaten. This battle immediately led to the Treaty of Breslau. }  Second Silesian War (1744–1745)  The Second Silesian War was also part of the Austrian War of Succession, but also a war fought for supremacy in Silesia between Prussia and Austria. Frederick II had allied himself at that time with France. Austria formed an alliance with Saxony, Great Britain and the Netherlands. In August 1744, Prussia ambushed Bohemia with 80,000 soldiers and thereby opened the Second Silesian War. After several hard battles, it was agreed in the Treaty of Dresden that Silesia would always remain in Prussian hands. {  ! Battle ! Date !

The Battle of Kesselsdorf was the last victory by the Old Dessauer and decided the war in favour of Prussia. } === Seven Years' War (1756–1763) ===  Third Silesian War (1756–1763)  The Seven Years' War, fought between Prussia and Great Britain on one side and Austria, France, Sweden and Russia on the other, involved all the great European powers of the time. In the Third Silesian War (the Austrian-Prussian theatre), Austria's goal was the reconquest of Silesia, but Frederick II pre-empted his enemies, and on 29 August 1756 crossed the border of Saxony without a prior declaration of war. Military success alternated and the Prussian army faced defeat in the end, in spite of major victories. On 15 February 1763 the Peace of Hubertusburg was signed between Prussia and its opponents. The status quo ante was restored. The war established Prussia as the fifth major power in Europe, but Prussia lost 180,000 soldiers during the war. {  ! Battle ! Date !

According to Jerzy Surdykowski Frederick the Great soon introduced German colonists on territories he conquered and engaged in Germanization of Polish territories. === War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–1779) === The War of the Bavarian Succession was fought between Prussia, Saxony and Bavaria on one side and Austria on the other. === Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1792–1815) === The Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars were a series of conflicts in the late 18th and early 19th centuries between Revolutionary France and later the French Empire and coalitions of various European states. Prussia was a member of three of the six anti-French coalitions. War of the First Coalition (1792-1795) The War of the First Coalition saw the monarchies of Europe, led by Austria, opposed to revolutionary France. It lasted from 1793 to 1797, though Prussia made peace in 1795. {  ! Battle ! Date ! Remarks -  width=\\"20%\\"  Battle of Valmy  width=\\"15%\\"  20 September 1792  width=\\"65%\\"  A French army defeated a 35,000 strong Prussian force. The French went onto the offensive in the first coalition war. The strategically rather unimportant battle is of historical significance because the revolutionary soldiers of France withstood for the first time a massive onslaught by opposing troops and saved the revolution. -  Siege of Mainz  14 April – 23 July 1793  Prussian troops and allied German troops besieged the French-occupied town. At the end, 19,000 French soldiers surrendered to the allies and withdrew. -  Battle of Pirmasens  14 September 1793  was a battle between French troops on the one hand and Prussian and Austrian troops on the other, which ended in victory for the allies. After heavy fighting, the battle was decided by attacking Prussian troops under the command of Lieutenant General Wilhelm de Courbière.  } War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-1807) The War of the Fourth Coalition saw Prussia and her allies in conflict with France over concerns about the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine and the expansion of Napoleon’s influence into Germany. It ended with the defeat of the coalition a year later. {  ! Battle ! Date ! Remarks - width=\\"20%\\" Battle of Saalfeld width=\\"15%\\" 10 October 1806 width=\\"65%\\" The battle took place between a French and a Prussian-Saxon army and ended with the defeat of the Prussians. The battle had no strategic influence on the course of the campaign, but the effect of the battle on the morale of the Prussians was considerable. In the night of 10–11 October 1806 disorder and panic broke out amongst the troops. Saxon and Prussian troops of the Hohenlohe Corps mistook each other for French troops and shot at one another. -  Battle of Jena and Auerstedt  14 October 1806  One of the most devastating defeats of the Prussian army. Over 10,000 Prussian and Saxon soldiers lost their lives. The defeat was a bitter blow to the Prussian-Saxon army, but the battle itself did not lead to a disaster. Not until the retreat did the troops get into such confusion that they could no longer be controlled in an orderly way and a large number of troops deserted. - Battle of Lübeck  6 November 1806  French troops under Nicolas-Jean de Dieu Soult were victorious against a 21,000 strong Prussian army under the command of von Blücher. He had to surrender with 8,000 remaining soldiers on 7 November. -  Siege of Graudenz  22 January – 11 December 1807  France and its allies besieged a Prussian fortress held by Wilhelm René de l'Homme de Courbière. The siege was continued months past the Peace of Tilsit and lifted only after the borders between Prussia and the new Duchy of Warsaw were set. -  Battle of Eylau  7–8 February 1807  Was a battle between the French and the allies, Prussia and Russia. The battle ended indecisively. As the fight appeared to be going in favour of the French, the Prussian corps under Colonel Scharnhorst with 8,000 men entered the fray, following a forced march on Preußisch Eylau, and struck the right flank of the French units. As a result, the Russian left flank was able to hold, and the French had to pull back. -  Siege of Kolberg  14 March – 2 July 1807  Was one of the biggest Prussia victories of the war. The fortress was able to hold out until the armistice. As a result, the names of Gneisenau, Schill and Nettelbeck became famous. This celebrated event was used by Prussian reformers as an argument for the necessity of involving ordinary citizens in the affairs of the state. -  Siege of Danzig  19 March – 24 May 1807  France besieged the Prussian port city which eventually capitulated. Afterwards it was declared as Free City of Danzig. -  Battle of Heilsberg  10 June 1807  -  Battle of Friedland  14 June 1807  }  War of the Sixth Coalition (1813–1814)  The War of the Sixth Coalition saw a re- vitalized Prussia join the allies against the French in 1813, resulting in France’s defeat in 1814. The German campaign covers all the military engagements that took place from 1813 to 1815 between the troops of Napoleonic France and the allies, consisting of Prussia, Austria, Russia, Sweden and Great Britain. After the liberation of the German nations, the winter campaign of 1814 ended with the abdication of Napoleon and the First Treaty of Paris. {  ! Battle ! Date ! Remarks -  width=\\"20%\\"  Battle of Lützen  width=\\"15%\\"  2 May 1813  width=\\"65%\\"  Napoleon lured the Prussian and Russian armies in this battle into a trap. The Prussians and Russians had to retreat after a day of heavy fighting. -  Battle of Bautzen  20–21 May 1813  During the retreat of the Prussian-Russian army Napoleon attacked again at Bautzen. Although the French were only able to win terrain, this battle is seen as a victory for Napoleon. -  Battle of Großbeeren  23 August 1813  The Prussian army under the command of Blücher defeated a French army under the command of Marshals Reynier and Oudinot.

The attack by Napoleon's forces on Berlin had failed; the Prussian capital escaped being conquered by the enemy. -  Battle of Katzbach  26 August 1813 The battle was an accidental encounter between French forces under the command of Marshal MacDonald and Prussian forces under Blücher. It ended in victory for the Prussian army. - Battle of Dresden  26–27 August 1813 The outcome of the battle was a French victory under Napoleon against the allied forces of the Austrians, Russians and Prussians under the command of Field Marshal Schwarzenberg. -  Battle of Hagelberg  27 August 1813  The battle took place as a consequence of the Battle of Großbeeren. A Prussian contingent (3,500 regular soldiers, 8,000 militia) under General von Hirschfeld defeated a French corps (about 10,000 men strong). Only about 3,000 Frenchmen reached Magdeburg. The battle, actually just a skirmish, was one of the first times the newly formed militia was deployed, and confirmed the value of this force. -  Battle of Kulm  29–30 August 1813  A 32,000-strong army of French, under command of General Vandamme, lost to an allied army of Austrians, Prussians and Russians. -  Battle of Dennewitz  6 September 1813  In this battle, Prussian troops of the Northern Army, which was under the command of the Swedish Crown Prince, Charles XIV John, defeated the French army and their allies, the Saxons. The victory prevented Napoleon finally from escaping to Berlin, and was an important precursor to the Battle of Leipzig. -  Battle of the Göhrde  16 September 1813  A Prussian contingent (12,300 men) defeated a 3,000-strong French unit under the command of General Pécheux. -  Battle of Leipzig  16–19 October 1813  In this battle, the troops of Emperor Napoleon fought the allies: Russia, Prussia and Austria.

Following the short-lived return of Napoleon, his reign was finally ended following his defeat against Great Britain and their Prussian allies in the Waterloo Campaign. {  ! Battle ! Date ! Remarks -  width=\\"20%\\" Battle of Ligny  width=\\"15%\\"  16 June 1815  width=\\"65%\\"  Ligny was Napoleon's last victory. He was able to defeat Blücher's Prussian troops, but not completely destroy them. This was to have fatal consequences for him at Waterloo. -  Battle of Waterloo  18 June 1815  The battle was the last and decisive battle of the Napoleonic Wars and ended in a victory for the allied Anglo–Prussian force under Blücher and Wellington. Napoleon Bonaparte had to resign as a result and was exiled to St. Helena. As a result, this battle is one of the most important battles in world history. -  Battle of Wavre  18–19 June 1815  This battle marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars and was fought between the Prussian rearguard under Johann von Thielmann and three French corps under Emmanuel de Grouchy. This fighting successfully prevented the intervention of these French units in the battle of Waterloo which might have been helped Napoleon to avoid defeat. } === First Schleswig War (1848–1851) === The First Schleswig War was the first military conflict over the Schleswig-Holstein question, which was about who should rule over the Duchy of Schleswig. The warring parties were, on the one hand the German movement in the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein in conjunction with the majority of nations in the German Confederation (including Prussia), and on the other hand the State of Denmark. The war was indecisive, so that, 13 years later, the next war broke out. {  ! Battle ! Date !

The war ended with the defeat of the Danes. The two victorious powers, Austria and Prussia, initially owned and ruled jointly over the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg. The strained relationship between the two states worsened however in the period that followed, until finally the Austro- Prussian War broke out in 1866. {  ! Battle ! Date ! Remarks -  width=\\"20%\\"  Battle of Dybbøl  width=\\"15%\\"  18 April 1864  width=\\"65%\\" The battle was the decisive engagement of the Second Schleswig War.

The war was fought for supremacy in the German lands (aside from Switzerland). It ended with a victory for Prussia (and its allies) over Austria (and its allies) and the dissolution of the German Confederation. Prussia thereby assumed political supremacy over Austria amongst the German nations and founded the North German Confederation. {  ! Battle ! Date !

He co-operated with John Stokoe in compiling the major song collection Northumbrian Minstrelsy published in 1882 == Early life == The eldest son of John Bruce of Newcastle, he was educated at the Percy Street Academy, a well- known school in Newcastle kept by his father, and afterwards at Mill Hill School, Middlesex. He entered Glasgow University in 1821, graduated M.A. in 1826, and became hon. LL.D. in 1853. In early life, Bruce studied for the Presbyterian ministry, but never sought a call from any congregation. In 1831, he began to assist in the management of his father's school, of which he became sole proprietor in 1834, when his father died. He retired from the school, after a successful career, in 1863. == Historical interests == Bruce's main interest was in the history of Britain, in particular North East England and more specifically Roman Britain and Hadrian's Wall. His books used a numbering system for the structures of the Wall, and by about 1930 it had become standard, using the milecastle located to the east. Examples are T33a or Turret 26B (Brunton): (see Numbering system and naming. His interest in music was largely historical, and in editing the Northumbrian Minstrelsy he co-operated with John Stokoe . The article Music of Northumbria credits Stokoe with copying out, in 1850, some of the tunes from John Smith's tunebook of 1750, a book now long lost, and the pair creating this comprehensive collection of old Northern Songs. The work was on behalf of, and published by, the Ancient Melodies Committee of the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne, of which Bruce was an active committee member. Bruce gave the Rhind Lectures in 1883, on the Roman occupation of Britain. == Family == His father, also John, had been a schoolteacher for over 40 years, first in Alnwick, then in Newcastle. He was an author and had written books, including a work on Geography. He died at his home in Percy Street, Newcastle on 31 October 1834 aged 60 years. Bruce married in 1833 Charlotte, daughter of T.

It is the primary religious center of the Tamil Jain community. It is headed by the primary religious head of this community, Bhattaraka Laxmisena Swami. ==History== The Tiruvannamalai and Villupuram areas have been an important centre of Jainism since ancient times. Historically, there was a Jain Math at Kanchipuram but it was shifted to its current location here. Venkatappa Nayak (1570-1600) is said to have given permission during his reign to build this Sittamur Jain Temple. Later, in 1860 CE, a Jain official in the Madras Provincial Services, Sri Baliah, dismantled several stone-pieces including the great stone elephants from the Gingee Venkataramana Temple, to make edifices in the Sittamur Jain temple. Among them the great stone elephants placed at the foot of the Termutti (car- stand), are noteworthy. ==Overview== There are two temples and one of them is dedicated to Parshvanatha. The other temple is dedicated to Malinatha and it was originally a boulder containing rock-cut images of Bahubali, Parsvanatha, Adinatha, Mahavira and Ambika yakshi. These images were carved in the 9th century CE. Parshvanatha temple or Raja Gopuram is a seven storeyed tower with a total height of more than 70 feet. Images of tirthankaras are carved on temple walls. Main idol of Parsvanatha temple is a black colored 14 feet idol of Parsvanatha in Padmasan posture. The 52 feet manastambha in temple is a monolith. Malinatha Temple is also known as Thiruvooram Palli or Kattam Palli. The carvings of Tirtankaras Bahubali, Parshvanatha, Adinath bagavan, Mahavira and Yakshi Dharma Devi belonging to the 7th century sculptured on a single rock here is a testimony to the workmanship of those days. ==Other Temples== *Gingee Jain Temple : Gingee Jain Temple is a very ancient and famous temple.

On 22 July 1783, Maistral was promoted to lieutenant de frégate entretenu, and appointed to the fluyt Étoile. In October 1783, Étoile departed Lorient, bound for San Domingo where she arrived in September 1784.

Commanding this ship, he took part in the Trafalgar Campaign. At the Battle of Cape Finisterre, he supported Atlas. At the Battle of Trafalgar, Neptune came immediately after the flagship Bucentaure, but was separated from her lead, opening a weakness that allowed HMS Victory to rake the French flagship and cut the French line, despite the efforts of Redoutable to fill the gap. Neptune aided Principe de Asturias and retreated to Cadiz. After Trafalgar, Maistral fell out of favour and was deprived of command until 12 November 1810, when he took command of the 15th flotilla crew.

Wolf chess (German: Wolf-Schach) is a chess variant invented by Dr. Arno von Wilpert in 1943. It is played on a 10×8 chessboard and employs several fairy pieces including wolf and fox – compound pieces popular in chess variants and known by different names. Wolf chess correspondence matches and tournaments have been held, one of which (Paris vs. Augsburg, September 1960) is claimed to be the first international match for a chess variant. ==Game rules== nightriders are represented by inverted knights; sergeants are represented by inverted pawns. Wolves start on squares g1/b10; foxes start on f1/c10. As in standard chess, White moves first and the winning objective is checkmate. The king, queen, rook, bishops, and pawns move and capture the same as they do in chess. In addition there are some special rules. ===Special rules=== * The wolf moves and captures as a chess rook and a chess knight. * The fox moves and captures as a chess bishop and a chess knight. * The nightrider moves and captures as a chess knight extended to make any number of steps in the same direction in a straight line. * A sergeant moves and captures one step straight or diagonally forward. A sergeant has the option, like a chess pawn, to move a double-step straight forward on its first move. * A pawn (but not a sergeant) may capture an enemy pawn or sergeant en passant. * Pawns and sergeants promote on the last to: queen, wolf, fox, rook, bishop, nightrider, or knight. Pawns (but not sergeants) have an additional option of promoting to elephant. The elephant piece is not present in the starting setup; it moves and captures as a chess queen and a nightrider (stronger than an amazon). * There is no castling in wolf chess. ==References== Bibliography * * * Wilpert, Arno von (1959).

This was the economic context in which Workers' Truth actedWorker's Truth (Rabochaya Pravda) was Russian socialist opposition group which was founded in 1921. They published Rabochaya Pravda, an eponymous newspaper, which first appeared in September 1921. Their programmatic statement (the \\"Appeal/Message to the revolutionary proletariat and all the revolutionary elements who remained faithful to the struggling working class\\") appeared in the Berlin-based Menshevik journal Sotsialisticheskii Vestnik in January 1922. They argued that during the First World War \\"military-state capitalism\\" had accelerated the tendency towards centralisation of economic management and had given rise to a new bourgeois class composed of the more effective elements of the old bourgeoisie, with new elements drawn from the technical organising intelligentsia. They claimed that although the Russian Communist Party had been the party of the working class, it had become \\"the party or the organisers and directors of the governmental apparatus and economic life along capitalistic lines.\\" To combat this they proposed forming secret propaganda circles in the work place, in the trade unions and other workers organisations as well as within the Communist Party and its affiliates. By August 1923 a wave of strikes spread across Russian industrial centres, sparked off by the Scissor crisis. On 8 September 1923 a number of arrests were made by the Soviet secret police in connection with Workers' Truth, including Alexander Bogdanov. He denied any organisational involvement with them, although they had claimed that they were inspired by his views. He demanded a personal interview with Felix Dzerzhinsky and spoke with him twice before being released on 13 October. In December 1923 Fanya Samoilova Shutskever, Efim Rafailovich Shul'man, Vladimir Markovich Khaikevich, Yakov Grigorevich Budnitsky, Pauline Ivanovna Lass-Kozlova, Oleg Petrovich Vikman-Beleev and Nellie Georgievna Krym were identified as the leaders of Workers' Truth and expelled from the Communist Party. ==See also== * Workers Group of the Russian Communist Party ==ReferencesExternal links== *Группа Рабочая правда, Материалы (in Russian, includes the \\"Appeal...\\") *Partial English Translation of the \\"Appeal...\\" *Full Portuguese Translation of the \\"Appeal...\\" (in Portuguese) Category:Factions in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Category:Soviet opposition groups ","title":"Workers' Truth"},{"id":"35950645","text":"Leucosia is a genus of crabs in the family Leucosiidae, containing the following extant species: *Leucosia affinis Bell, 1855 *Leucosia anatum (Herbst, 1783) *Leucosia brevimana Bell, 1855 *Leucosia brevior Ortmann, 1892 *Leucosia compressa Shen & Chen, 1978 *Leucosia corallicola Alcock, 1896 *Leucosia craniolaris (Linnaeus, 1758) *Leucosia formosensis Sakai, 1937 *Leucosia haswelli Miers, 1886 *Leucosia jecusculum (Rathbun, 1911) *Leucosia laevimana Miers, 1884 *Leucosia leslii Haswell, 1879 *Leucosia longibrachia Shen & Chen, 1978 *Leucosia longimaculata Chen & Fang, 1991 *Leucosia margaritacea Bell, 1855 *Leucosia moresbiensis Haswell, 1880 *Leucosia ocellata Bell, 1855 *Leucosia pacifica Poeppig, 1836 *Leucosia phyllocheira White, 1847 *Leucosia pulcherrima Miers, 1877 *Leucosia punctata Bell, 1855 *Leucosia reticulata Miers, 1877 *Leucosia rubripalma Galil, 2003 *Leucosia sima Alcock, 1896 *Leucosia tetraodon Bouvier, 1914 *Leucosia whitmeei Miers, 1875 ==References== Category:Crabs ja:ツノナガコブシ ","title":"Leucosia (genus)"},{"id":"35950658","text":"John Henry Sturdy (January 27, 1893 - September 20, 1966) was an educator and political figure in Saskatchewan.

Educated at the University of Saskatchewan and the Saskatoon Normal School, he taught school briefly and then served in France with the Canadian Expeditionary Force during World War I. After the war, he farmed for a while and then became a school principal in Fort Qu'Appelle. In 1934, Sturdy was an unsuccessful Farmer-Labour candidate for the Qu'Appelle-Wolseley seat in the provincial assembly. The following year, he was elected to the executive of the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation. In 1940, he became the overseas assistant director of educational services for the Royal Canadian Legion. Sturdy served in the provincial cabinet as Minister of Reconstruction and Rehabilitation, as Minister of Social Welfare and as a minister without portfolio. In 1956, he chaired the Committee on Indian Affairs, which recommended giving First Nations people in Saskatchewan the rights to vote in provincial elections, to live outside of reserves and to purchase liquor. After retiring from politics in 1960, Sturdy moved to Victoria, British Columbia.

It was adopted by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger as part of phenomenology.Roderick Munday, \\"Glossary of Terms in Being and Time\\", Retrieved 2012-05-27 Marcuse defines it as \\"the logic of judgment\\".Herbert Marcuse, \\"One Dimensional Man: Part II, Chapter 5\\", Retrieved 2012-05-27 In Aristotle's usage, the Greek term ἀποφαντικὸς λόγος (apophantic speech) describes a statement that, by examining a proposition in itself, can determine what is true about a statement by establishing whether or not the predicate of a sentence may logically be attributed to its subject. For example, logical propositions may be divided into ones that are semantically determinate, as in the sentence \\"All penguins are birds,\\" and those that are semantically indeterminate, as in the sentence \\"All bachelors are unhappy.\\" In the first proposition, the subject is penguins and the predicate is birds, and the set of all birds is a category into which the subject of penguins should necessarily be put. In the second proposition, the subject is bachelors and the predicate is unhappy. This is a subjective, contingent connection that does not necessarily follow. An apophantic conclusion would, by examining the two statements—and not any evidence supporting or denying them—make a judgment between them that identifies \\"All penguins are birds\\" as more truthful than \\"All bachelors are unhappy.\\" One would reach this conclusion simply because of the propositions' nature, and not because any penguins or bachelors had been consulted. In phenomenology, Martin Heidegger argues that apophantic judgements are the least reliable means of obtaining truth, as they are cut from the original interpretive framework of relations to the subject.Roderick Munday, \\"Glossary of Terms in Being and Time\\", Retrieved 2012-05-27 Before Heidegger, however, his former teacher Husserl had already centralized the role of apophantic judgment in his phenomenological 'transcendental logic', during the course lectures on passive synthesis in the mid 1920s.

Madhavan and written by J. Mahendran. Based on Mahendran's play of the same name, the film stars Sivaji Ganesan, K. R. Vijaya, Srikanth and Prameela. It focuses on a disciplined Superintendent of Police who is dedicated to his job, while his son, on the contrary, is rebellious by nature and grows to resent his father. Ganesan reprises his role from the play. Thangappathakkam was released on 1 June 1974. The film was a commercial success, running for over 175 days in theatres, and thereby becoming a silver jubilee film. It served as an inspiration for the Telugu film Kondaveeti Simham (1981), the Kannada film Kadamba (2004) and the Hindi film Shakti (1982). == Plot == Choudhry is a strict and committed police officer. Though a loving husband and father, his top priority is his duty. While he upholds the principles of justice and honesty, his son Jaganath proves contrary to this even at a young age. After his father berates him for skipping school and indulging in gambling, Jaganath runs away from home. He lands in Bombay, where he is caught by the police for a petty theft and is admitted into a juvenile prison there. Though Choudhry's wife Lakshmi longs to meet their son, Choudhry prevents her as he feels it would hamper Jaganath’s reformation process. Years later, Choudhry is promoted to Superintendent of Police. Jaganath, after his release, returns home. While affectionate towards his mother, he still dislikes his father. This hatred has been ingrained over the years since his father had ignored him for the sake of duty. Jaganath falls in love with a woman named Vimala, marries and brings her home. Choudhry and Lakshmi accept her, hoping that all differences have been sorted out and they would now be able to enjoy domestic happiness. However, father and son are still at loggerheads. Jaganath, who befriended other criminals in prison, indulges in several illegal activities like theft, kidnapping and smuggling, and is wanted by the police. Choudhry tries his best to reform Jaganath, but fails. His repeated attempts to reform him are misunderstood by Jaganath, who decides to take revenge on his father for blocking his path to easy riches. In their fight, the family splits and a depressed Lakshmi dies. Jaganath does not come even for her cremation. Jaganath decides to sell sensitive military documents to a foreign country for a large sum. Choudhry learns of this, confronts him and persuades him to stop but Jaganath refuses and shoots Choudhry, who is forced to shoot back. Jaganath dies in the arms of Choudhry who survives, and is later rewarded with a gold medal for his valour. == Cast == Adapted from credits: * Sivaji Ganesan as S. P. Choudhry * K. R.

Palanivel * Veeraragavan as Rajasekaran Chettiyar / Inspector Nithyanandan == Production == Irandil Ondru was a play written by J. Mahendran for actor Senthamarai. While naming the male lead character, a Superintendent of Police, Mahendran could not find any convincing name in Tamil; he found the Bengali name \\"Choudhry\\" convincing, and decided to give the character that name. After seeing the play, Sivaji Ganesan bought the rights and staged the play again with some changes under the title Thangappathakkam, starring as Choudhry. This play, which was inaugurated in 1972, was directed by S. A. Kannan. It became a huge success, being staged more than 100 times. Ganesan's company Sivaji Productions decided to adapt it into a film with the same title, with P. Madhavan directing. Ganesan's daughter Shanthi Narayanaswamy produced the film along with T. Manohar. Mahendran wrote the film's dialogues and was also credited for the original story. Ganesan reprised his role from the play as Choudhry, K. R. Vijaya was cast as his wife Lakshmi, reprising the role originally played by Sivakami while Srikanth was cast as Choudhry's son Jagan, reprising the role originally played by Rajapandian. Cho was cast in two roles: a politician named Vaiyapuri and his older brother Sundaram, a constable. Mahendran did not write any dialogue for the scene where Lakshmi dies, instead he \\"visually depict[ed] the sorrow of a widower, which was very challenging. But Sivaji managed it in a single take.\\" Cinematography was handled by P. N. Sundaram, and editing by R. Devarajan. == Themes == According to Ganesan, Thangappathakkam is not about a man killing his son to receive a gold medal, but a police officer's commitment to his post. In his view, the story elucidates the code of conduct for police officers and how they should perform their duties; the character upholds justice, so the title \\"Thangappathakkam\\" (meaning gold medal) actually personifies this dutiful police officer. Within the film, Vaiyapuri calls the policy Annaism (introduced in 1973 by politician M. G. Ramachandran, described by him as \\"a blend of the fine aspects of Gandhism, communism and capitalism\\") as \\"Appaism\\" (Anna meaning elder brother and Appa meaning father), as a means of ridiculing the policy which was known for being very radical. == Soundtrack == The music was composed by M. S. Viswanathan, with lyrics by Kannadasan. The song \\"Thatti Sellum\\" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Valaji, and \\"Sumaithangi Saaithal\\" is set in Harikambhoji. == Release and reception == Thangappathakkam was released on 1 June 1974. F. C. Arul, the then Inspector General of Tamil Nadu, made all possible arrangements to exhibit the film in 16 mm in all police stations throughout Tamil Nadu. On 30 June 1974, the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan appreciated the film and mentioned that Ganesan showed how a police officer should behave and live through his fantastic acting, and added that the film was a gold medal for Ganesan. Thangappathakkam was a commercial success, running for over 175 days in theatres, thereby becoming a silver jubilee film. It won the Chennai Film Fans' Association Awards for Best Film, Best Actor (Ganesan), Best Story (Mahendran) and Best Actress (Vijaya). == Impact == Thangappathakkam was dubbed in Telugu as Bangaru Pathakkam in 1976. It served as an inspiration for the Telugu film Kondaveeti Simham (1981), the Kannada film Kadamba (2004), and the Hindi film Shakti (1982). According to Rediff's N. Sathiya Moorthy, Ganesan's characterisation of Choudhry \\"became a role model for aspiring young police officers\\". The characterisation of the role became a benchmark in such a way that many later Tamil films would often refer to Choudhry when mentioning an \\"honest and upright officer\\". According to film historian G. Dhananjayan, the scene where Choudhry does not utter even a word after his wife's demise \\"is the way [Mahendran] started his brand of cinema\\". == References  Bibliography == * * * == External links == * Category:1970s Tamil-language films Category:1974 films Category:Fictional portrayals of the Tamil Nadu Police Category:Indian action drama films Category:Indian films based on plays Category:Indian films Category:Tamil films remade in other languages Category:Tamil films scored by M.

Copperplate engraving from Topographia Provinciarum Austriacarum by Matthäus Merian (1679) Haymon is a mythical figure from Tyrol in form of a giant. It is said that Haymon was the founder of Stift Wilten, a premonstratensian abbey, located in the south of Innsbruck. He is said to have lived between 600 and 900 years ago and to have died in the year 878 A.D. in Wilten. According to a 13th-century sources, Haymon's grave is at the altar of the Collegiate Church in Wilten. It has been speculated that Haymon was a Bavarian nobleman named Haimo. Albeit its similar spelling and pronunciation to the ancient Greek name Haimon (), no relation could be shown. == Tradition == Different traditions have been amalgamated in the legend of the giant Haymon. In the 15th century, the local legend of the Gold-Guarding Dragon who lives on the hill Bergisel east of the river Sill was created. This dragon was killed by Haymon. Set in gold, the dragon's tongue (the horn extension of a sword fish) is still today shown in the Tyrolean State Museum Ferdinandeum in Innsbruck. Another tradition, which comes up about the 16th century, reports of a fight between Haymon and the giant Thyrsus, who lived in the area of Zirl and Seefeld, eventually killing him. From Thyrsus's blood (the so-called Thyrsenblut the healing Tyrolean Shale Oil or Ichtltyol is extracted. The last words of the giant Thyrsus were: \\"Blood spray! Be good for man and beast! (Spritz Bluet! Sei für Viech und Menschen gut!)\\" Thus, Haymon, the immigrant from the north, defeats the local Thyrsus. In remorse, Haymon takes the Christian faith being baptized by the Bishop of Chur. Thereafter, he founded the monastery Wilten which he hands over Benedictine monks from the Tegernsee Abbey. Then he joined the order as a lay brother and stayed there until his death. Towards the end of the 16th century, all these motives could be found in the founding legend of the monastery Wilten. Even in the 17th century, the belief in the historical existence of the giant Haymon was still so strong that the then abbot of the monastery Wilten had an excavation for Haymon's bones carried out in the church. The excavations ended without result, eventually throwing over parts of the church. According to contemporary scholarly interpretation of the 17th Century, the giant Thyrsus represents the Romansh people while the invading Bavarians, who populated the Inn valley as of the 6th century, are being represented through Haymon. In the fight between Haymon and Thyrsus the defeat of the Romansh people by the Bavarians is symbolized. While Thyrsus is often depicted as a somewhat primitive layman who is fighting with a torn tree, Haymon is depicted as a gallant giant with a sword. Life-size figures of the two giants Haymon and Thyrsus can be found at Wilten where they are at the entrance to the church. An engraving from 1677 by J.J. Jezl shows Haymon as a knight with a sword and the dragon's tongue in his hands. The signature says \\"Haymon Fundator Monasterii Wilthinensis, obiit Anno D. 878\\" (Haymon founder of the monastery in Wilten, died 878). == Miscellaneous == In the region around Innsbruck, various restaurantsTraditionsgasthaus Riese Haymon and institutions are named after the giant Haymon. * In Innsbruck, there is an alley named Haymongasse * The book publisher Haymon Verlag is named after the mythical figure * The name of the wireless router HiMoNNHiMoNN of the south German company IABG is a homophone of Haymon. == Books == * Michael Forcher, Der Riese Haymon, Haymon Verlag, Innsbruck, 2007 * Wolfgang Morscher, Berit Mrugalska-Morscher, Die schönsten Sagen aus Tirol, Haymon Verlag, Innsbruck, 2010 * Jakob Grimm, Wilhelm Grimm, Deutsche Sagen.

Hellawes is the widow Sir Gilbert the Bastard, recently slain by Meliot, and she had magically cursed Meliot so his wounds from the fight would not heal. In the story, she manages to lure the questing knight into her fearsome chapel perilous but Lancelot—who has been the object of her obsessive and unrequited love for seven years—successfully escapes with the items he needed to heal Meliot: A similarly named but different character, also appearing in Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, is Lady Annowre of Perilous Forest.

It is found in the North Pacific Ocean. ==Description== Neosabellaria cementarium lives in a tube which it creates by cementing together grains of sand. This is attached along its length to a rock, shell or other hard substrate. At first it is short but it is widened and extended as the worm grows, sometimes reaching a length of more than and a diameter of . The worm is largely hidden within the tube but it has a yellow or golden- coloured operculum and a number of fine tentacles which it extends in order to feed. Sometimes the tubes are solitary and sometimes they are grouped together but this species does not form reefs. In California, Neosabellaria cementarium can be confused with the sandcastle worm (Phragmatopoma californica). The latter is a reef-building worm and its tentacles and operculum are purple rather than yellow. ==Distribution== Neosabellaria cementarium is found in a range extending from Alaska to southern California. ==Biology== Neosabellaria cementarium has trochophore larvae which form part of the plankton. Each larva has a ciliated band with two bundles of long, barbed setae (bristles), one on each side of its body. These are fanned out when the larva is feeding and seem to have a defensive function, perhaps preventing a predator from recognizing the larva as a prey item or irritating the mouth tissues of comb jellies or other predators. Another band of short cilia at the posterior end of the larva enable it to swim, and when it is doing this, the setae are held alongside the body. In Puget Sound, Washington, aggregations of up to 3,500 tubes of Neosabellaria cementarium per square metre at depths of between were found to provide a habitat to a diverse range of other organisms not found in adjacent areas. Neosabellaria cementarium is one of a number of fouling organisms that live as epibionts on the shells of scallops such as Chlamys hastata and Chlamys rubida. ==References== Category:Sabellida Category:Animals described in 1906 ","title":"Neosabellaria cementarium"},{"id":"35950945","text":"Tuo Tong (born 27 April 1984) is a Chinese fencer who competed in the team épée event at the 2004 Summer Olympics. ==References== Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese male fencers Category:Olympic fencers of China Category:Fencers at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Fencers from Chongqing ","title":"Tuo Tong"},{"id":"35950946","text":"Thomas Beaver Free Library and Danville YMCA is a historic library and YMCA located at Danville, Montour County, Pennsylvania.

AD 9/1220/27) was the eldest son of the Roman Emperor Claudius with his first wife Plautia Urgulanilla. He had one younger sister, Claudia, who was repudiated by Claudius along with Plautia. == Background == Tiberius Claudius Drusus's grandfather was Marcus Plautius Silvanus and his great-grandmother was Urgulania. Urgulania is presumed to have helped her friend Livia, the future emperor's grandmother and the wife of the emperor Augustus, to arrange the marriage of Claudius and Plautia Urgulanilla when Claudius was around 18. Claudius married Plautia Urgulanilla sometime between 9 and 12 AD. Tiberius Claudius Drusus was born soon after the marriage, decades before his father became emperor. Throughout his life, the emperor was his relative Tiberius, son of Livia. == Life == Some five months after his daughter Claudia Julia was born, Claudius divorced Plautia on suspicion of adultery and complicity in the murder of Apronia, her brother's wife, who had been pushed from a window. The divorce may have been as early as 20 to as late as 27 AD. Claudius disowned Claudia Julia by exposing her on Urgulanilla's doorstep, believing her to be fathered by a freedman of his, but he did not dispute the paternity of his son Claudius Drusus, leaving the boy Claudius's only son at the time. A marble statue of Claudius Drusus was installed in the Sebasteion of Aphrodisias, an augusteum temple dedicated to the cult of the divine emperors and their family; its inscribed base was uncovered during archaeological excavations there in the late twentieth century. Claudius Drusus was betrothed to Aelia Junilla, the only daughter of Lucius Aelius Sejanus, the commander of the Praetorian Guard. In 20 AD Sejanus was reaching the height of his power, and the birth of his daughter offered an opportunity to connect his own family with the imperial Julio-Claudian dynasty. This betrothal filled Sejanus, then just a prefect, with unfulfilled hopes. The Roman historian Tacitus wrote that the people were not satisfied with this match as they were with the betrothal of Claudius Drusus's cousin, Nero Caesar, son of the popular general Germanicus Julius Caesar. Probably it was felt the nobility of the family () was to be polluted; Sejanus was not of senatorial rank and his appointment as a praetor in 20 AD was an unprecedented novelty. Claudius Drusus was ultimately never married to Aelia Junilla, who may have only been born in the year of their betrothal. According to Tacitus: == Coinage == Probably in honour of the occasion of his betrothal to Aelia Junilla, an issue of coins is known to have been minted at Myrina in Aeolis, on the coast of Asia Minor. Myrina was of little importance at the time, and had comparatively little involvement in the imperial cult. However, in 17 AD the region suffered a major earthquake, and Myrina was one of twelve cities to receive funds for reconstruction from the Fiscus, the imperial treasury, as well as five years' tax remission from the Roman Senate. It is therefore likely that the coins, of which five examples are known to exist, were issued at a time of substantial gratitude towards Tiberius. The obverse of the bronze coins shows a draped bust of Claudius Drusus facing to the right with the legend written clockwise in . On the reverse is a wreathed head of Apollo, together with a lyre and the name of the Myrina mint, written anti-clockwise: . == Death == The year of Claudius Drusus's death is not precisely known. The Roman historian Suetonius's account suggests he died in 20 AD, but Tacitus's Annales suggests he was still alive in 23 AD, when, according to Tacitus the emperor Tiberius's son Drusus the Younger said of Sejanus in disgust \\"the grandsons of us Drususes will be his grandsons too\\". (.) This suggests that Claudius Drusus was still due to marry Sejanus's daughter. Subsequently, it was suspected that Claudius Drusus had been murdered by Sejanus, but Suetonius did not believe that.Suetonius (121). The Lives of the Twelve Caesars. \\"Claudius\\", part 27. Instead Suetonius said he had choked to death on a pear he had thrown into the air.

He is said to have lived in Innerleithen close to Reith. Thyrsus is mentioned in the legend of the giant Haymon. According to tradition, Thyrsus was stronger, more dexterous and half a head taller than Haymon. ==Background== In the Germanic mythology, Thürse, Thürsus, and Thurse are names for prehistoric giants. The hrimthurs, who are made of frost and ice, are descendants of the world's giant Ymir. In the legend of the giant Haymon, however, Thyrsus is a proper name. ==Tradition== The cause of the dispute between the two giants Haymon and Thyrsus is reported differently: One tradition tells that Thyrsus felt provoked by the immigrating Haymon (\\"Rheinländer\\" which means man from the river Rhine), because Thyrsus had already lived for ages in the Upper Inn Valley. Another tradition reports of a sudden destruction of Haymon's castle during one night. Whilst one reported variant provides no reason for the sudden destruction, another variant says that it was Haymon's human neighbors who destroyed his castle. Then, they knowingly accused Thyrsus to be the perpetrator. The fight between the two giants was reported to have taken place close to the hamlet Thyrschenbach - today: Dirschenbach. During the fight, Haymon stabbed a deep wound into Thyrsus' heel with his sword, so that a fountain of bright blood poured out. Thyrsus took a turf, stuffed it into the wound, and fled into Karwendel. The many blood, which he had lost, leaked into the rocks. Haymon followed him and reached him close to the hill Leitner Kogel. There Haymon slew Thyrsus. The last words of the giant Thyrsus should have been: \\"Blood spray! Be good for man and beast! (Spritz Bluet! Sei für Viech und Menschen gut!“)\\" Only long time later, local farmers found the healing Thyrsusblut - named Dirschenblut - in the rocks of the Karwendel mountains (cf. Tyrolean Shale Oil). == Miscellaneous == At the time of plague, Thyrsus once fell ill. In order not to infect the rest of the villagers, he retreated into the cellar of his house. Thus his village was spared from the plague. The house vis-à-vis the Chapel of the Holy Saint Magnus in Reith (almost Leithen) is said to be Thyrsus' house. == Books == *Michael Unterwurzacher (Ed.), Im Reich des Patscherkofel: Sagen und Fakten rund um Innsbrucks Hausberg und das Südöstliche Mittelgebirge, Books on Demand, 2009 *Michael Forcher, Der Riese Haymon, Haymon Verlag, Innsbruck, 2007 *Wolfgang Morscher, Berit Mrugalska- Morscher, Die schönsten Sagen aus Tirol, Haymon Verlag, Innsbruck, 2010 == External links == * \\"Wie Haymon den Riesen Thyrsus erschlug\\" at Sagen.at * \\"Die Sage vom Riesen Haymon\\" at Haymon.at * \\"Der pestkranke Thyrsus\\" at Sagen.at Category:Giants Category:Germanic mythology Category:Tyrol (state) ","title":"Thyrsus (giant)"},{"id":"35951007","text":"Park Se-Young (; born 3 October 1989) is a South Korean footballer who plays as a forward for Gimhae FC in the Korea National League. == External links == * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Association football forwards Category:South Korean footballers Category:Seongnam FC players Category:K League 1 players Category:Korea National League players ","title":"Park Se-young (footballer)"},{"id":"35951025","text":"Hong Jin-Gi (; born 20 October 1990) is a South Korean footballer who plays as a centre back for Busan IPark. ==Club career statistics== {   - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Other ! colspan=2  Total - !

Some suppose she is among the kneeling women on the left; however, Catherine Cornaro is the first woman on the left (standing, with a girl to her left). She is praying. The group of gentlemen is perhaps that of Bellini's family, including his self-portrait and that of his brother Giovanni. At the centre is the Bridge of San Lorenzo (\\"St. Lawrence Bridge\\"), full of people who are looking at the event. The fondamente (the roads which flank the Venetian channels) are also crowded, with some people coming on gondolas. Some people have dived and a woman, on the right, is pushing her moorish slave to do the same: however, Andrea Vendramin has already grabbed the relic and is carrying it to the shore.

It is now housed in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice. ==History== The painting was commissioned for the Grand Hall of the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista, the seat of the eponymous brotherhood in Venice. The commission included a total of nine large canvasses, by prominent artists of the time such as Bellini, Perugino, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Mansueti, Lazzaro Bastiani and Benedetto Rusconi. Detail. The subject of the paintings was to be the miracles of a fragment of the True Cross. The item had been donated to the brotherhood by Philippe de Mézières (or Filippo Maser), chancellor of the Kingdom of Cyprus and Jerusalem in 1369, and soon became the object of veneration in the city. The canvasses were all executed in 1494–1496. All survive today, aside from that by Perugino, and were donated to the Gallerie dell'Accademia in 1820 after the fall of the Venetian Republic and Napoleonic suppressions. In December 2019, conservation treatment sponsored by the non- profit organization Save Venice Inc. was undertaken in order to remove surface dirt, old varnish, discolored inpainting and residue left from earlier 19th- century treatments. ==Description== The painting shows the miracle of the healing of a madman through the relic of the Holy Cross, held by the Patriarch of Grado Francesco Querini, which took place in the Palazzo a San Silvestro on the Canal Grande, near the Rialto Bridge. The scene has an asymmetrical composition, with figures in the foreground at the left and, behind them, the façade of the buildings following the canal. They feature the typical inverted cone chimneys of medieval Venice. Detail. The miraculous event is relegated to a wide loggia in the upper left corner: most of the canvas is occupied by a veduta with a great number of characters and naturalistic items. The people include a group of walkers who precede the religious procession following the relic. The bridge is still in wood, as it was before it collapsed in 1524. Like the current version (dating from 1591) it had a double row of shops at the sides and, at the top, a movable boardwalk needed to allow the passage of the taller vessels. On the right is the 15th-century appearance of the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, destroyed by a fire in January 1505. Other architectural features include the bell tower of San Giovanni Crisostomo, the portico of Ca' da Mosto and the bell tower of Santi Apostoli before its reconstruction in 1672.

It was built between 1897 and 1901. It is regarded as Seager's best large house. Originally, the house was set on , with the land having been subdivided off the Deans family. It was initially added to until 1910, when it had 50 rooms and five live-in staff. Jane Deans had planted 100 blue gums in 1862 on the property. Rooks were nesting in the trees, hence the name Daresbury Rookery. The trees became infested by chalcid wasps and the rooks left in the 1930s. A snow storm in 1945 further damaged the trees. The last gum tree was cut down in 1952. Between 1940 and 1950, Daresbury was the official residence of the Governor-General. Over time, the land was subdivided, with 20 sections sold in 1954.

The remaining chimneys were removed by crane. ===Heritage registration=== Following the 2010 Canterbury earthquake, the building's chimney pots were removed and stored in the garden The building was registered as a heritage building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust on 2 April 1985 with registration number 3659 classified as A. With the change of the classification system, the building later became a Category I listing. ==Architecture and awards== Daresbury is an example of the English Domestic Revival style, also known as the Arts and Crafts movement. It is built of triple brick, and the upper stories are half-timbered. In 1932, the property won the Christchurch Horticultural Society garden competition.

In this season, Dinamo played in Liga I, Cupa României and UEFA Europa League. The European place was earned after Dinamo won the Romanian Cup in the season before. Dinamo kept Dario Bonetti as head coach, and won the first trophy of the season, Romanian Supercup, with a win against champions CFR Cluj. But after that the good results failed to appear. Dinamo was eliminated from Europa League, and after 15 rounds, when the team laid on the seventh spot of the standings, Dario Bonetti was sacked and Dorinel Munteanu was brought to replace him. In the Romanian Cup, Dinamo was eliminated by CFR Cluj, after extra-time. At the end of 2012, Munteanu resigned citing his desire to coach abroad. His place was taken by Cornel Ţălnar. Under his spell, Dinamo started well the second half of the season and entered the fight for a European place. But after a round of poor results, Dinamo missed a place for a European competition for the first time since 1998. ==ReviewPre- season=== Dinamo started its preparations for the new season on 15 June, with the medical examination. Only one new player was present, Andrei Cristea, who returned to Dinamo after one and a half years spent in Germany. Another new player brought by Dinamo was Issa Ba, a Senegalese midfielder whose contract with CS Gaz Metan Mediaş expired. Instead, Dinamo released Iulian Tameş and Dorel Stoica on mutual agreement, and sold Adrian Scarlatache to Khazar Lankaran. On 21 June, Dinamo left for Austria, for an 18 days training camp, during which, the team played a large number of friendly games. The first matches were against amateur football teams from the Bischofshofen region. Thus, Dinamo's manager, Dario Bonetti had the chance to see the entire team at work, and also the players brought from the youth team, or players on trial. The first important friendly game was played against Ukrainean champions, Shakhtar Donetsk. Dinamo lost the game 1–0. Dinamo failed to win any other friendly game played in Austria, losing five and drawing against Anorthosis Famagusta from Cyprus. On 26 June, Dinamo lost an important player, Cosmin Moţi, sold to the Bulgarian team Ludogorets Razgrad. The defender who played more than six years for Dinamo was in his final part of his contract, and the Red Dogs accepted the offer because they could lose him for free in the next months. Instead, Dinamo managed to sign Cristian Scutaru and Mircea Axente, both returning to Liga I where they played for Poli Timișoara. In the previous season, they played for Poli in the second division. Also, Dinamo signed the Bulgarian midfielder Boris Galchev, from CSKA Sofia. ===Season=== July Dinamo started the season on a high note, winning the first match and consequently the first trophy. It was the Romanian Supercup, where Dinamo defeated the champions CFR Cluj, after penalties. The white and reds controlled the game, having a superior ball possession (60.4%)and a larger number of completed passes (534 vs. 308). In Liga I, Dinamo played the first game against a newly promoted team, CSS Drobeta-Turnu Severin. In front of 14,500 spectators, Dinamo opened the score in the 51st minute, through Mircea Axente, at his first game for the white-reds. The home team equalized a couple of minutes later, but Ionel Dănciulescu, coming from the bench, brought all three points for Dinamo with a goal scored in the 80th minute. The same day, 20 July, Dinamo sold one of its symbols, Marius Niculae, a player grown at the club's academy, who left for a few years to play abroad, but returned to Dinamo. He was transferred to Liga I rivals FC Vaslui. The first home game in this season was played on National Arena, where Dinamo decided to move for the entire season. On 29 July, Dinamo defeated CSMS Iaşi 5–2, George Ţucudean scoring four goals and offering the decisive pass for the fifth. The striker received the perfect ten in the Gazeta Sporturilor match chronicle. August The first false step came in the third round, when Dinamo met FC Braşov. In Braşov, Dinamo won only once since 2004, and the black series continued. Braşov led twice, but Dinamo came back every time, and the match ended in a tie. In the fourth round, Dinamo should've met Rapid Bucuresti, but the game was postponed because at that time Dinamo played a friendly game against giants FC Barcelona. The game was played at National Arena in Bucharest, and although Barcelona won 2–0, Dinamo had moments when they rose to their rivals level. Eight Dinamo players were called to the national teams for the friendly games played at 15 August. Two of them scored goals, Marius Alexe and George Ţucudean helping Romania U21 squad to win against Sweden U21. Despite the big number of players who left to play internationally, Dinamo's game in the fifth round was not postponed and the manager was forced to change the squad a lot, players like Marius Alexe, Constantin Nica and Cosmin Matei being rested. Thus, Dinamo failed to win at Chiajna, against Concordia. The game ended 0-0. The European season started badly for Dinamo. In front of 20,000 fans, at Arena Națională, Dinamo was beaten by the Ukrainian side Metalist Kharkiv, quarterfinalist in the Europa League the previous season. In the sixth round, Dinamo came back to its old stadium, because Arena Nationala was not available due to a concert by Red Hot Chili Peppers. Only 4,000 fans came to see the match against Petrolul Ploiești. Dinamo took the lead in the third minute, when Srdjan Luchin scored with a header his first goal for the club in the championship. Previously, he scored two goals for Dinamo, both in the Romanian Cup. Petrolul equalised in the 29th minute, but Dario Bonetti's inspiration paid off in the second part. The manager sent Ţucudean on the pitch in the 62nd minute, and the striker scored in the injury time after a cross from Cătălin Munteanu. In the second leg of the Europa League encounter, Dinamo could not produce a miracle. They were beaten at Kharkiv, 2–1. September The seventh round produce Dinamo's first defeat in the championship. In Ploiești, against Astra, Dinamo lost 1–0, the only goal being scored in the injury time, from a penalty kick. Dinamo played almost the entire second half with only 10 men, Paul Koulibaly being sent off in the 49th minute. The break for the national teams didn't help, after that Dinamo suffering the third defeat in a row. This time, at home, against Romanian champions CFR Cluj. The drought was ended at Cluj-Napoca, where Dinamo defeated Universitatea Cluj, 2–1. It was the first game of the season for Ionel Dănciulescu as a starter, and the striker scored one goal, his 209th in Liga I, from a penalty that he obtained. Alexandru Curtean scored the other goal for Dinamo. Three days later, Dinamo started with a win the campaign to defend the trophy in Cupa României. In front of their own fans, at Dinamo Stadium, the red-dogs defeated Vointa Sibiu after extra-time. October In the next championship round, Dinamo met the former leader, Pandurii Targu Jiu. The game was played at National Arena, under special conditions. Dinamo commemorated 12 years since Cătălin Hâldan died, and the supporters created a special captain armband, with Hâldan face. In this game, Ionel Dănciulescu played for the 490th time in Liga I, equalling a record detained so far by Costică Ştefănescu. Dănciulescu scored a goal against Pandurii, his 210th in Liga I. Dinamo defeated Pandurii 3–0. In the next game, at Mediaş, Dănciulescu played his 491st match in Liga I, after which he became the player with the most presences in the first league. The team failed to win the third game in a row, drawing with Gaz Metan, 2-2. The competition took a break for the national team's games. After the break, Dinamo suffered another defeat at home. The newly promoted Gloria Bistriţa lead 2–0 at Arena Naţională, Dinamo managed to score a single goal and in the second half Ionel Dănciulescu missed a penalty. The first Bucharest derby of the season was played on 22 October, against Rapid. The game was initially scheduled in August, but it was postponed due to the friendly game against FC Barcelona. Rapid took the lead after a goal from Daniel Pancu, in the 30th minute, but Marius Alexe scored twice, the second time from the penalty spot, and Dinamo won 2–1, climbling to the fifth place in the championship. After that, Dinamo continued its sinusoidal evolution, and failed to win against Ceahlăul Piatra Neamţ. The game ended in a goalless draw. November Dinamo started the month of November on a high note, managing to qualify to the quarterfinals stage of the Romanian Cup with a win in Târgu Jiu, against Pandurii. It was the second win in the season against this team, and the first loss suffered by Pandurii at home. In the Eternal derby, against Steaua, Dinamo led at the half time, after a goal scored by Marius Alexe. After one hour, the referee, Alexandre Boucaut from Belgium, gave a penalty kick for Steaua, transformed by Raul Rusescu. In the 80th minute, the referee didn't see an obvious foul against Cosmin Matei, committed by Chipciu who should've been sent off for this foul. Two minutes later, Steaua scored for 2–1, and in the 87th minute, their third goal came, putting a 13 points distance between the two rivals. Neither in the next game, Dinamo could not find the way to victory. The \\"White-and-reds\\" lost at home against FC Vaslui, 1–0. Thus, this is the worst start of a season in 41 years for Dinamo, since 1971. As a consequence, Bonetti was sacked and Dorinel Munteanu was installed the new head coach. Munteanu signed a contract for two and a half years. His debut game was in Constanța, against Viitorul. The game was only two days after his installation, so he didn't change much the team comparing with the usual players used by Bonetti. The game ended in a draw, 1-1, after Viitorul failed to convert a penalty in the first half, when the score was 0-0. The first win under Dorinel Munteanu came against the trainer's former team, Oţelul Galaţi. Dinamo won the game 2–1. In the quarter-finals of the Romanian Cup, Dinamo played away against CFR Cluj. Despite having a player sent-off, Boubacar Mansaly in the 31st minute, Dinamo took the lead in the 60th minute, due to a goal scored by Marius Alexe. Rafael Bastos equalized in the 66th minute, then Gabriel Mureşan scored the winning goal in the 101st minute, transforming a free kick. Dinamo ended the game with nine players on the pitch, Constantin Nica being sent-off in the final minutes. Dinamo lost 2–1, and failed to defend its trophy. December The month of December started well for Dinamo who won the game against CS Severin, 4–2. The game was played at the Dinamo stadium, instead of Arena Naţională, and brought only 200 people in the stands. Dinamo remained unbeaten with Munteanu for another game, as the match against CSMS Iaşi ended in a draw. The pitch was covered in snow and made the players' mission heavier. At the end of the year, after only one month and five games in charge at Dinamo, Dorinel Munteanu resigned as head coach, citing the wish to follow his dream to coach abroad. His replacement was Cornel Ţălnar who started his fifth spell at the helm of the team. January After the winter holiday, Dinamo started its preparations for the second half of the season with a training period at Poiana Braşov, during which, the new coach, Cornel Ţălnar, concentrated on physical exercises. On 21 January, Dinamo announced that defender Cristian Pulhac ended his contract after almost 11 years spent at the club. Dinamo also parted ways with striker George Ţucudean, sold to Standard Liege. February The first official game of the spring season was played against FC Braşov.

The basic intention is for the combination of integrated hardware and software that can be easily maintained. A similar concept had already been introduced with the IBM AS/400. Today, such systems are called converged systems. More specialized integrated hardware and software are referred to as appliances. The compute nodes of the server blades can be x86 or Power ISA and they can be used either individually or mixed in the same rack simultaneously, thus offering a hybrid ensemble which borrows from the zEnterprise/zBX ensembleIBM PureSystems Hint at the Future of zEnterprise April 16, 2012 at DancingDinosaur.comPureSystems Joins zEnterprise Hybrid Family May 8, 2012 at DancingDinosaur.com (cf.

Additionally, there are bays in the rear for I/O modules. A flex- chassis can accommodate up to 14 horizontal compute and storage nodes in the front, and 4 vertically oriented switch modules in the rear. Contrasting to this, the IBM BladeCenter (9U high) has vertically oriented compute nodes (\\"blades\\"). This means that the components between the BladeCenter chassis and Flex chassis are not interchangeable. Based upon the Flex Systems architecture (the components of which are individually available), there are three main products: * PureFlex System (IaaS) * PureApplication System (PaaS) * PureData System (tightly coupled and specialized computer appliance / software appliance) ===PureFlex=== PureFlex is a factory pre-configured and combined hardware-/software system for IaaS in terms of cloud computing.

It is aimed at e-commerce [i.e. retail and credit card processing environments) which depends on rapid handling of transactions and interactions. These transactions are small in size, but their sheer volume and frequency require a specialized environment. The new system can provide 5x performance improvement, partly through advances in high performance storage. PureData System for Analytics builds on Netezza technology and it is aimed at business intelligence that entails huge queries with complex algorithms. It provides a large library of database analytical functions for data warehouse applications, and can scale across the terabyte or petabytes running on the system. It can support extremely high volume high speed analytics for clients (e.g. mobile phone carriers who want to identify potential churn and provide offers to retain customers).IBM Launches New PureSystems For Transactions And Big Data Analytics by Tom Groenfeldt, Oct 9, 2012 at forbes.com PureData Systems for Operational Analytics is an operational warehouse system which supports real-time decision making. In contrast to PureData System for Analytics, which is aimed at handling large sets of data at a time, PureData for Operational Analytics is more or less a stream computing system that can analyze many small sets of data in real-time while PureData for Analytics will provide analysis only in hindsight but with large sets of data, though. Potential uses of PureData Systems for Operational Analytics are fraud detection or analysis of rapid fluctuations in supply-and-demand cycles.

Her music combines pop music, classic country, honky tonk, and punk rock. == Early life == Loveless was born in Coshocton, Ohio, in the Newcastle area. She is the daughter of Parker Chandler and has two older sisters, Eleanor Sinacola and Jessica, who now performs under the stage name \\"Jessica Wabbit\\". Loveless grew up on a farm in a rural area outside of Coshocton and was home-schooled. She said she felt like an outcast in a town that emphasized religion and conformity until she moved to Columbus, Ohio when she was 14. She enjoyed Hank Williams III and punk-influenced country music, while also embracing popular music and rock and roll and \\"pretty much anything on Kemado Records.\\" Her family is musical: Loveless' father was a pastor, drummer, and later country- western bar owner for a time. She and her sisters played several instruments. Loveless took piano lessons, then began trying to play the guitar at 12. Loveless at DC9 (Washington DC) September 2014 == Career == Lydia Loveless performing at SXSW 2014 In 2004, Loveless, her father, and her sisters made up part of a four-member new wave pop band called Carson Drew, named after the father in the Nancy Drew books. Loveless played bass. The band broke up in 2007. At a show in Cincinnati where she opened for his band, Loveless met producer David Rhodes Brown (500 Miles to Memphis) who went on to produce her first album, 2010's The Only Man. Loveless was not happy with the slick production of the album. Loveless made the record when she was 15 years old. Loveless clarified that she likes the songs she wrote, but the drawn-out process (over three years) to get the album released influenced her feelings about the project. Columbus attorney Steve McGann became her manager. Loveless and her band drove 20 hours to Austin, Texas, and ended up playing for Bloodshot owners Rob Miller and Nan Warshaw at the 2010 South by Southwest music festival. In 2012, signed with Bloodshot and determined to make a more raw and edgier album, she released Indestructible Machine with songs that feature themes of frustration with her hometown, drinking, depression, and a humorous song about being stalked by a man who referred to himself as Steve Earle but was not in fact the singer of Copperhead Road. Loveless recorded the album with many live takes and a minimum of overdubs at Grove City, Ohio’s Sonic Lounge recording studio with engineer Joe Viers. Spin characterized the record as standing out \\"for its utter lack of bullshit\\", with \\"roaring vocals, in her narrators' lived-in-bars recklessness, and in her overall inability to mince words.\\" Indestructible Machine received praise from AllMusic and in publications such as the Chicago Tribune, Spin, and The Washington Post. Greg Kot wrote that Loveless' \\"defiant tone is matched by songs that put country and punk on equal ground, unvarnished and direct\\". In the Spring of 2013, Loveless did an extensive Canadian tour supporting the Supersuckers. Loveless and her band also toured Scandinavia and Spain during the Fall of 2013. Lydia Loveless singing Four Leaf Clover with the Old 97s. 9:30 Club (Washington DC) May 31, 2014 In 2013, Loveless released Boy Crazy, an EP. Mark Deming of AllMusic praised the release, asserting that the album \\"is further proof that Loveless is a major talent, and if her next album is as good as this, she may run the risk of becoming a very big star\\". One of the songs, \\"Lover's Spat\\", is about the serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. Rolling Stone cited Loveless as one of its \\"10 New Artists You Need to Know: January 2014\\". In February 2014, Loveless released her third full-length record, Somewhere Else, on Bloodshot Records, which has a dark, \\"poppy\\" vibe. Stereogum said Loveless is using her \\"unmistakable voice as a songwriter, and she's only getting better at using it to blur the line between running her mouth and pouring out her heart.\\" Loveless was listed as one of \\"5 Best New Artist for January 14\\" by Spin magazine. The record includes \\"Head\\", a single Loveless wrote with her guitar player, Todd May, a fellow songwriter. The album had a very positive reception and entered Billboard's Heatseekers chart (new entries to Billboard charts, compiled by Nielsen SoundScan) the first week of its release at position number 7. In April 2014, Loveless released the Mile High/Blind 7\\" record for Record Store Day. The record had a non-album cut titled \\"Mile High\\" on the A side and a cover of Kesha's \\"Blind\\" on the B side. It was a limited edition release on lime green vinyl. The tracks were released in digital album format on May 27, 2014. In April 2015, Loveless was part of a Record Store Day release with label-mate, Cory Branan. The two artists cover two Prince songs: Loveless doing \\"I Would Die 4 U\\" and Branan doing \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\". The 7\\" limited edition releases were also pressed onto purple vinyl. Loveless donated her vocal talent to the end credits song from the film, A Dog Named Gucci, in the song \\"One Voice\\", which also features the voices of Norah Jones, Aimee Mann, Susanna Hoffs, Neko Case, Brian May and Kathryn Calder. It was produced by Dean Falcone, who also wrote the film's score. \\"One Voice\\" was released on Record Store Day, April 16, 2016, with profits from the sale of the single going to benefit animal charities. In August 2016, Bloodshot Records released her third studio album, Real. Her first ever music video, for the album's first single \\"Longer\\" received its world premiere through Rolling Stone in July 2016. The video was directed by filmmaker Gorman Bechard, who directed the documentary on Loveless. On August 19, a second Bechard-directed music video was released this time for the song \\"Clumps\\". The next morning Loveless and her band made their American TV network debut, performing three songs on CBS Saturday Morning. A video for the song \\"European\\", also directed by Bechard, debuted in November 2016. The A.V. Club called Real \\"an adventurous, brutal honest sucker punch\\", while The Boston Globe said, \\"Loveless continues to manifest a remarkable combination of bruised vulnerability and desperate longing, alongside a tough, self-deprecating resilience, but there's more of the former and less of the latter this time. She's still preoccupied with the downsides of love: longing for something you don’t (or can’t) have, the inevitable dissolution of whatever you manage to find (and the difficulty of finding it in the first place), and the emotional pitfalls of navigating it.\\" Rolling Stone liked the shift in genre towards a more pop sound. Loveless released her fourth studio album Daughter through her own label, Honey, You're Gonna Be Late Records on September 25, 2020. == Documentary == Loveless was the subject of a documentary called Who Is Lydia Loveless?, in which filmmaker Gorman Bechard (Color Me Obsessed, Every Everything: The Music, Life & Times of Grant Hart) documented the making of Loveless' album Real, as well as following her on the road, and looking into what life is like for a band at her level in the music industry.from and interview on the Americana Music Show #299, published May 10, 2016 \\"I also wanted to look at stuff we normally don't see a lot of. What are the finances for a band like this? Where does the money go? Who gets the money? Is Spotify good? Is Spotify bad? How does piracy affect you? What about the fans? I really wanted to go into all of that for a band that can still sell out 200–250 seat venues and bars but is still all travelling in an old Ford van. A good night is when they have a couple of hotel rooms. No one is rolling in the dough so to speak. So what is it at that point when you have amazing critical success and acclaim but you’re not there yet?\\" In October 2015, Bechard and his crew filmed a live Lydia Loveless concert at Skully's in her hometown of Columbus for the documentary. The film had its world premiere on April 7, 2016 at the Columbus International Film & Video Festival. == Songwriting == Loveless' lyrical bent includes feminist/strong-woman statements, therefore naturally includes a lot of drinking songs. Loveless is an avowed fan of Kesha, and has played \\"Blind\\" in her live shows. == Discography == Hand-made wood coaster in shape of Lydia Loveless' heart tattoo – with an X through it.

Pakistan won the test series 3–0, and one day series 2–0. Australia failed to win a single game on the entire tour. In the words of Wisden, \\"The Australians proved ill-equipped to cope with a Pakistan side beginning to exert its international authority under the leadership of Imran Khan... For Pakistan it was the country's finest cricketing hour. Their three-nil Test victory was unprecedented in a short series there... It all amounted to a tour to rank among the most dismal ever made by an Australian side.\\" Australia's wicketkeeper on the tour, Rod Marsh, later wrote that \\"the more you think of the 1982 Australian cricket tour of Pakistan the more you want to forget it.\\"Marsh p 8 ==Australian squad== Australia had just defeated Pakistan 2–1 at home during the 1981–82 summer season and several of the players had previously toured Pakistan. Captain Greg Chappell and fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Len Pascoe who had all just toured New Zealand were all unavailable for selection on the tour. Chappell was replaced as captain by Kim Hughes, his vice-captain, despite the fact that many observers felt the more experienced Rod Marsh should have gotten the job. Hughes had led Australia to defeat on tours of India (1979) and England (1981). The Australian squad announced on 26 March 1982 was: *Batsmen – Kim Hughes (captain), Allan Border (vice-captain), Graeme Wood, Bruce Laird, John Dyson, Greg Ritchie, Wayne Phillips (also back up wicketkeeper) *Fastbowlers – Jeff Thomson, Geoff Lawson, Ian Callen, Terry Alderman *Spinners – Bruce Yardley, Peter Sleep, Ray Bright *Wicketkeeper – Rod Marsh *Manager – Col Egar *Tour doctor – Dr Paul Koenig *Tour physiotherapist – Fergus Nelson Rick Darling was overlooked despite having scored over 1,000 first class runs that summer. However Ritchie had made 836 runs at 59.5 and Phillips had scored 857 runs at 47.6. John Inverarity (30 wickets at 21.6), Jim Higgs (29 wickets at 39.3) and Bob Holland (27 wickets at 24) had taken more wickets as spinners than Sleep (22 at 33) or Bright (20 at 37) at first class level that summer but were not taken. Ian Callen had not toured with Australia since he went to the West Indies in 1978 but had taken 31 wickets over the 1981–82 summer. Rod Marsh refused to serve as vice captain under Kim Hughes, saying he wanted \\"to give a younger player the experience of being vice-captain.\\" He was replaced by Border. The selection panel on tour was Hughes, Border and Laird. Wisden later reported \\"it seemed that Kim Hughes had a strong and well-balanced team under his command.\\" Hughes thought the team was in better shape than the squad which lost to Pakistan in 1980: > We struggled before, but the spinning combination of Ray Bright and Bruce > Yardley, the left- and right-arm orthodox bowlers, gives us a better balance > and makes me optimistic of winning the series... But I'm not underestimating > our quicks. Jeff Thomson can get us into a winning position if the wickets > allow. But he may not be able to get amongst them on the final day and our > spinners will have to knock them over. Hughes would be facing Imran Khan as Pakistan captain. \\"\\"I have a healthy respect for Imran\\", said Hughes. \\"He is fiercely competitive but fair.\\" ==Preparations== Col Egar flew to Pakistan in July in order to help plan the tour. The team met for four days in Perth for a training camp on 4 September. Kim Hughes said he was pleased with the squad: > Pakistan are in the process of developing one of their best sides ever and > they seem to be able to bat well down the order... The boys will have to > handle a different diet, customs and outlook on life — but it will be worth > it.... Sleep and Yardley have been to India and that should stand them in > good stead... In the spin department we have the great balance of a left-arm > orthodox in Ray Bright and a right arm exponent in Yardley... The five > regular batsmen, Border, Dyson, Bruce Laird, Graeme Wood and myself have > seen a lot of cricket, and Ritchie and Phillips will be given every chance > to be considered for the Tests. There had been criticism of Pakistan pitches over the years. The curator of the WACA ground, John Maley, went to Pakistan in 1981 to advise the Board of Cricket Control on making of wickets. Maley found some suitable soil and recommended that the Test strips in Karachi, Faisalabad and Lahore be dug up and relaid. ==Tour== The team left Perth on 9 September and travelled via Singapore to Karachi before flying to Rawalpindi. Rod Marsh stayed behind a few days to help his small child recover from an illness. ===BCCP Patron's XI v Australians at Rawalpindi, 12–14 September 1982Scorecard of BCCP Patron's XI v Australians accessed 4 July 2014=== Australia's first tour game was against the BCCP Patrons XI. Wayne Phillips played as wicketkeeper because of Marsh's unavailability, and Australia decided to play three spinners, Sleep, Bright and Yardley. Australia began well in the first innings, making 9-327 with a century from Kim Hughes, and half centuries from Graeme Wood and Allan Border. Hughes brought up his century with a six off the last over of the day. However Australia's bowlers struggled to dismiss the opposition, who declared at 5-424, with contributions from Masood Anwar (125), Mansoor Akhtar (130) and Haroon Rasheed (94); Yardley's figures were 2-136. A second innings collapse saw Australia come close to losing the game, falling to 5-82 before recovering to 8-166 at close of play. It ended in a draw. ===BCCP XI v Australians at Multan, 16–18 September 1982BCCP XI v Australians at Multan 1982 accessed 4 July 2014=== Australia fared much better in the next tour game, against BCCP XI, where they almost forced a victory. Wood, Hughes and Greg Ritchie both scored half centuries in Australia's first innings total of 277. BCCP XI went from 0-96 to all out for 177, with Ray Bright and Geoff Lawson picking up five wickets each. Australia responded with 3-124 (Hughes opening made 43) then declared. The BCCP XI were 4-67 at close of play. Ritchie's first innings score of 59 put him in contention for test selection. ===1st ODI: Pakistan v Australia at Hyderabad (Sind), Sep 20, 19821st ODI match report at Wisden=== Australia travelled to Hyderabad to play Pakistan in a one-day international. It was the first such game Australia had played in Pakistan. The locals were led by Zaheer Abbas in the absence of Imran Khan, who had a side strain. It was the first one-day match Australia had played in Pakistan. Australia played five batsmen (Wood, Laird, Hughes, Border, Dyson) and five bowlers (Thomson, Yardley, Lawson, Alderman and Ian Callen – the latter playing his first international for Australia since 1978). The crowd of 30,000 was 5,000 more than capacity. About 3,000 police were on duty, many using riot shields, and extra security was implemented as the match went on. A two-metre high steel fence with tipped lances had been erected around the playing area at a cost of A$30,000. Hughes won the toss and elected to bowl. Mohsin Khan put on 83 with Mudassar Nazar. During Pakistan's innings, some crowd members ran on to the pitch and some Australian players had to defend themselves from what reports described as \\"enthusiastic mobbing\\". Kim Hughes had to push away one persistent youth who rolled over on the ground to the cheers of the crowd. When Graeme Wood caught Zaheer Abbas for 26 off Bruce Yardley, large numbers of the crowd passed through loopholes in the fence and charged on to the field, making for Mohsin Khan who was then on 97. Police and officials took five minutes to chase them off using batons and staves. Moshin went on to make a century, prompting another pitch invasion by a youth who attempted to garland him and Allan Border, fielding at square leg. The Australian manager, Col Egar, protested and it was announced soon after noon that the teams would return to Karachi if any further disturbances occurred. The game resumed and Pakistan ended with 6-229 off 40 overs. The crowd continually threw stones at police and during the break, one youth impaled himself on the fence and was taken away for treatment. In response, Wood and Bruce Laird took Australia to 0-104 off 23 overs before a collapse resulted in them being dismissed for 9-170. Tauseef Ahmed took three wickets and Imran's replacement, Jalal-ud-Din took a hat-trick consisting of Marsh, Yardley and Lawson off the fourth, fifth and sixth balls of his seventh over.1st ODI scorecard ===1st Test: Pakistan v Australia at Karachi, Sep 22-27, 1982=== Australia's team for the first test was Wood, Laird, Dyson, Border, Hughes, Greg Ritchie (making his test debut), Bruce Yardley, Ray Bright, Jeff Thomson and Geoff Lawson. Geoff Lawson was picked over Terry Alderman who was made 12th man. Pakistan's team was Mohsin Khan, Mansoor Akhtar, Haroon Rasheed, Javed Miandad, Zaheer Abbas, Mudassar Nazar, Imran Khan, Tahir Naqquah, Wasim Bari, Abdul Qadir and Iqbal Qasim. Hughes won the toss and decided to bat. There were 3-202, with good innings from Dyson (87) and Hughes (54) when Australia lost two quick wickets – Hughes and Ritchie. Rod Marsh later wrote these two wickets meant \\"we probably lost the entire series in just half an hour on the first day of the first test.. it was just what the Pakistanis needed and just what we didn't. They came out next day and skittled us with the new ball. Had we got through that crisis time and resumed with only three down, it might have been a new ball game, a new series.\\"Marsh p 14 Wisden reported that \\"Australia's 218 for five at the close of the first day was inadequate considering the excellent conditions.\\" Australia were dismissed for 284 with Border 55 not out. Pakistan made 419 in response, with the Australians dropping key catches. Zaheer Abbas, for instance, was dropped at nine, 61 and 80 and made 91. \\"We lost concentration with the interruptions, dropped catches, but the bowlers, particularly the pacemen, Jeff Thomson and Geoff Lawson, were magnificent\\", said Kim Hughes. \\"Not once did they knock back a spell but just kept going.\\" The \\"interruptions\\" were serious. Items being thrown on the ground – including stones, potatoes and onions – led to Hughes taking his side off the ground on two separate occasions on the third day – one for 14 minutes, one for 25 minutes.1st test match report at Wisden Hughes said, \\"We should have gone off earlier, but I was sorry for the umpires and the other people who had paid good money to see cricket.\\" Sikander Bakht, a Pakistani paceman not playing in the Test, said the local players were used to this behaviour. \\"But I don't blame the Australians for going off\\", he said. Hughes later threatened to call off the tour if any of his players were injured. > I'm not going to let my fellows* heads be cut open by razor-sharp stones... > This is an insult to the Australian players – we are being treated like > animals in a zoo... We should have gone off earlier, but I was sorry for the > umpires and the other people who had paid good money to see cricket... We > are here to play cricket and are being treated like animals. No wonder other > cricketing countries are loath to come here. What bothers me is what happens > when we are in a winning position? The same treatment was handed out to the > West Indians. We can take the verbal abuse, but I've reached a position > where our blokes don't want to field at fine leg. The Karachi commissioner went with local cricket-association officials to plead with the rioters and were met with a hail of stones, vegetables and water bombs. Appeals were made in Urdu to keep calm in an almost non-stop use of the public-address system throughout the afternoon. \\"Pakistan is in a strong position : don't worry the batsmen\\", pleaded the announcer. Hughes was still positive, saying \\"If our second-innings batsmen put in three-quarters of the effort of Thommo and Henry, we should save the day. It's still a good wicket and if we can hold them to 100 ahead, we are still in it.\\" Australia collapsed in their second innings, making 179, with no Australian batsman making more than 32. Abdul Qadir took 5-76, Iqbal Qasim 2-48. Qadir won the game with a spell of 5-44 from 20 overs after the fourth day, including Dyson, Wood and Border in 18 deliveries for six runs. Pakistan scored the 47 required to win with the loss of only one wicket. \\"But for some appallingly sloppy fielding, we may have made quite a game of the first test\\", wrote Marsh later. \\"Geoff Lawson and Jeff Thomson did everything anyone could expect of them, but were badly let down by dropped catches. If we'd held those chances, it may have been a different story.\\"Marsh p 19 ===2nd Test: Pakistan v Australia at Faisalabad, Sep 30-Oct 5, 1982=== Pakistan kept the same side for the second test. Australia replaced an ill Bruce Yardley with Peter Sleep. Pakistan batted first and scored 6-501 declared, despite good bowling from Geoff Lawson (4-97). Mudssas and Moshin put on 123 for the opening partnership. Zaheer Abbas made 126 after being dropped on 57; Akhtr made 111. Wisdensaid Lawson's bowling \\"was an effort of sustained pace and fortitude.\\" Australia then wilted under the bowling of Qadir (4-76) and Qasim (2-28) making 168, Wood top scoring with 49. Imran enforced the follow on and his bowlers dismissed Australia for 330 with the spinners taking nine of the wickets – Qadir 7-142 and Qasim 2-91. The one bright spot for Australia was Ritchie's second innings century, 106 not out; Laird made 60.2nd test report at Wisden Geoff Lawson complained about being given out leg before wicket, resulting in an official complaint from the umpire. Col Egar worried if the team had inadequate preparation: > The boys have come out of a six-month layoff, started their per sonal > physical fitness programs in , July, had four days in Perth, two under match > conditions on the WACA ground, and then were flung into a totally different > world against a national side at the top of their playing abilities after an > England tour. The only opportunity to tour was now, but we arc meeting the > conscquences of our decision... The Australian batting performance yesterday > let down the fielding effort on the previous day, as well as the courage of > Lawson with the ball. The bats men read too much into the wicket and gave > the advantage to the Pakistan bowling. When we began it seemed that we could > get 350 at least, but the dismissals of Bruce Laird and John Dyson were > vital and from an umpiring viewpoint, unfortunate. ===2nd ODI: Pakistan v Australia at Lahore, Oct 8, 19822nd ODI scorecard=== Australia decided on an all-pace attack for the second one-day international, trusting the bowling to Thomson, Lawson, Alderman and Ian Callen. Alan Border was the fifth bowler. Pakistan made 3-234, with Zaheer Abbas scoring 109 and Javed Miandad 61. Australia made 4-204 in response, Laird carrying his bat with 91 not out and Kim Hughes scoring 64 off 67 runs. Wisden wrote that \\"there was almost an inevitability about Pakistan's advance to victory, despite the temporary abandonment of the antiquated scoreboard by the scorers and a stand of 117 between Laird and Hughes in 74 minutes... Laird was three hours making 91 not out when Australia desperately needed more positive strokeplay.\\"2nd ODI report at Wisden Zaheer Abbas was named man of the match. ===Pakistan Invitation XI v Australians at Sialkot, Oct 10-12, 1982Pakistan Invitation XI v Australia scorecard=== Australia played a tour game against a Pakistan Invitation XI. Wayne Phillips and Ian Callen joined the team, Phillips doubling as wicketkeeper and opener. The first day was washed out. Australia batted first and made 4-283, Phillips top scoring 92 and Dyson making 71. Pakistan Invitational XI were 7-169 not out at close, Bright taking three wickets. ===3rd Test: Pakistan v Australia at Lahore, Oct 14-19, 1982=== For the third test, Australia decided to drop Sleep and Bright and use a three-man pace attack in conjunction with Yardley, recalling Terry Alderman to support Geoff Lawson and Jeff Thomson. Wayne Phillips was 12th man. According to press reports, \\"Hughes gave a do-or-die talk to the team\\" before the test, \\"but it may yet prove to be as futile as rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\\" Australia batted first and scored 316, due to late order knocks from Lawson (57) and Yardley (40). Imran Khan took 4-45. Pakistan made 7-467 in response. Javed Miandad was dropped three times, once on 9 before making 138. Mohsin Khan scored 135. Jeff Thomson kicked down the stumps on the second day after umpire Shakoor Rana had no-balled him. The umpire spoke to the bowler and then to Hughes. After several more no-balls had upset Thomson, he was taken out of the attack. \\"It was most unThomsonlike behaviour and I'm sure he regretted it as soon as he'd done it\\", wrote Marsh. \\"But he'd had enough of Pakistan. We all had.\\" By stumps on the fourth day Australia were 3-66. Dyson made 51 and Hughes batted for three hours making 39 but they were dismissed for 214. Pakistan won by nine wickets. It was the first time Australia had lost every test in a series in the subcontinent3rd test report at Wisden According to one report, \\"The out-of-touch Australians have struggled throughout this disappointing tour, made out of season, to honour a commitment. Reputations have gone by the board as batsmen and bowlers have floundered, and most of the team have been out of action at some time with stomach complaints and other virus infections.\\" Col Egar told the press: > We are battling against the odds – that's not a gutless situation. We are > suffering from lack of practice before the tour, our batting lacks timing, > we have gone on the defensive and negative cricket breeds dismissal. The > bowlers arc short of lead-up match practice and let's face it, we are > playing against a powerful side. I will certainly recommend to the > Australian Cricket Board that we don't tour again out of season. We will > have to make sure we come here in 1988 at the end of the Sheffield Shield > season. Imran Khan was man of the match. Geoff Lawson was Australia's man of the series and Abdul Qadir was Pakistan's. ===3rd ODI: Pakistan v Australia at Karachi, Oct 22, 19823rd ODI scorecard=== Australia's team for the 3rd ODI saw Ian Callen return to the Australian side (replacing Ray Bright – Australia went for an all pace attack) and Wayne Phillips made his ODI debut as an opener. Fifteen minutes into the game Geoff Lawson was seen throwing a stone back into the crowd while fielding at long leg. Hughes and the umpires spoke to him and after lengthy conversations, and a plea from Hughes to the stands for calm, decided to carry on. However items continued to be thrown from the stands. When Pakistan were 1-39, Lawson was hit on the leg, and Hughes led his players from the field. For almost an hour Hughes discussed possibly abandoning the game with Imran, managers and officials, but eventually, at the urging of Australian manager Col Egar, the Australians decided to return. Within an over, Pakistan were 1-44. Items began being thrown again and Greg Ritchie was hit. Hughes led his team from the field, this time for good. The Australians were evacuated from the stadium, then it was announced the game was abandoned. The crowd turned on the police, attacking them with stones and seats ripped up from the stands, and setting light to the canvas awnings used as protection from the sun. The police responded with baton charges and tear gas. The conflict spilled into the streets surrounding the stadium. Rioters even prevented fire engines from reaching the ground. Pakistan authorities used volunteers at the stadium instead of police, keeping police in reserve. \\"If the authorities are too frightened to use police inside the ground then we are too frightened to play cricket\\", said Col Egar.3rd ODI report at Wisden Rod Marsh later said he \\"asked around and people in the know said the mob had nothing against us personally. No, they were protesting because they wanted a new grandstand built at the ground. They've a funny way of expressing themselves in Pakistan.\\"Marsh p 15 Australia flew home via Singapore from Karachi on the morning of 23 October 1982. They were seen off at the airport by their liaison officer, Talat Ali. ==Summary== The series was seen as a triumph for Pakistan, who played without Sarfraz Nawaz. Imran Khan and Abdul Qadir bowled particularly well, with the latter taking 22 wickets, a record for a series against Australia. According to Wisden: > His remarkable dexterity, variety and accuracy, usually exploited from round > the wicket, to find boot marks at the other end, caused the Australians such > difficulties that it made his absence from the team which had visited > Australia the previous summer all the more inexplicable. His success was > achieved, moreover, against batsmen who prided themselves on their ability > to cope with the ball tossed into the air and turning from leg. Qadir's > ability to turn the ball sharply in both directions eroded the Australians' > patience and confidence and frustrated their desires to advance down the > pitch to get the better of him.Wisden - the Australians in Pakistan 1982/83 > accessed 4 July 2014 Qadir received strong support from Iqbal Qasim and together they took 30 of the 56 Australian wickets to fall to bowlers in the three Tests. Pakistan also batted particularly well, especially openers Mohsin Khan and Mudassar Nazar, with strong support from Zaheer Abbas, Mansoor Akhtar, and Javed Miandad. \\"They played very good cricket\\", wrote Marsh. \\"Percentage cricket.\\" Of the Australians, Graeme Wood, Bruce Laird and John Dyson scored some useful runs and Greg Ritchie impressed with his century. Hughes and Border were disappointing. Wisden called fast bowler Geoff Lawson \\"the outstanding Australian... his spirit was undaunted by the failures of his fellow players, and he remained the one bowler to trouble the Pakistanis in all conditions throughout the series.\\" Australia's spinners only took six test wickets between them, although Australia did drop fifteen catches throughout the series. \\"It all amounted to a tour to rank among the most dismal ever made by an Australian side\\", said Wisden. \\"It is almost too painful to recall what happened to us on the field in Pakistan\\", wrote Rod Marsh. \\"We thought like losers, we played like losers. And we lost everything we attempted.\\"Marsh p 12 Rod Marsh later claimed to have lived off Australian beer and canned fruit that was shipped into the country. He says players amused themselves by watching in-house television movies and setting off fireworks.Marsh p 9 ==Controversies== Riots in the crowd caused Kim Hughes to twice lead the Australian team from the field during the first test, and also to abandon the third one-day international.Martin Williamson, 'Australians Get Stoned', Cricinfo, 4 October 2008 accessed 27 May 2012 Kim Hughes wanted to continue to captain Australia full-time. However Greg Chappell was reappointed Australian captain for the 1982–83 Ashes. In October 1982 Ian Chappell wrote \\"maybe the Australian Cricket Board will now believe me when I say: 'Kim Hughes isn't the best man for the job of Australian captain'. Because of the Board's unwillingness to back down and admit that a decision it made in 1979 was wrong, the Australian team has been made to suffer a number of disasters that could be avoided. Hughes, along with Graham Yallop, has done for Australian captaincy what Mrs. Miller did for female vocalists in the 1960s. The time has come for the board to swallow its pride, thank Hughes for his efforts, and start grooming for Allan Border to take over from Greg Chappell.\\" Chappell did think the form of Geoff Lawson and Greg Ritchie were two positives but thought the \\"biggest disappointment\\" was the performance of Peter Sleep and felt Stuart Saunders may be in the running the play England. Chappell wrote \\"all in all, Pakistan has not quite been the disaster it first appears in the record books, except if your name is Kim Hughes.\\" ==References== *Marsh, Rod The Inside Edge Swan Publishing 1983 ==External links== *Australian Tour of Pakistan in 1982-83 at Cricinfo *Australian Tour of Pakistan in 1982-83 at Wisden *Australian Tour of Pakistan in 1982-83 at Test Cricket Tours *Australian Tour of Pakistan in 1982-83 at Pakistan Cricket Board *Australian Tour of Pakistan in 1982-83 at CricketArchive *Richie Benaud interviews Imran Khan about the series at YouTube Category:1982 in Australian cricket Category:1982 in Pakistani cricket 1982-83 Category:International cricket competitions from 1980–81 to 1985 Category:Pakistani cricket seasons from 1970–71 to 1999–2000 ","title":"Australian cricket team in Pakistan in 1982–83"},{"id":"35951419","text":"During the 2002–03 Italian football season, Brescia competed in the Serie A. ==Kit== Brescia's kit was manufactured by British sports retailer Umbro and sponsored by Banca Lombarda. ==SquadGoalkeepers=== * Davide Micillo * Matteo Sereni ===Defenders=== * Fábio Bilica * Dario Dainelli * Simone Dalla Mano * Víctor Hugo Mareco * Gilberto Martínez * Fabio Petruzzi * Marco Pisano * Anthony Seric ===Midfielders=== * Stephen Appiah * Jonathan Bachini * Antonio Filippini * Roberto Guana * Matuzalém * Markus Schopp ===Attackers=== * Andrea Alberti * Roberto Baggio * Massimiliano Caputo * Simone Del Nero * Abderrazzak Jadid * Igli Tare * Luca Toni == Results  Serie A === Category:Brescia Calcio seasons Brescia ","title":"2002–03 Brescia Calcio season"},{"id":"35951425","text":"Milton Armory is a historic National Guard armory located at Milton, Northumberland County, Pennsylvania.

The winners did not qualify for the UEFA Women's Champions League. Birmingham City Ladies, beat Chelsea Ladies 3-2 in a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in the final at Ashton Gate. The match was televised live by Sky Sports 2. The channel's decision to switch the transmission of the penalty shoot-out to behind the red button was criticised and described as embarrassing. The attendance of 8,723 was the lowest at the FA Women's Cup final since 2005. Entertainment at the final included a half time performance from The Risk, a boy band who had finished 10th in the previous year's edition of The X Factor. ==Route to the finalBirmingham City Ladies=== right { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\\" !scope=col width=\\"25\\"  Round !scope=col width=\\"200\\"  Opposition !scope=col width=\\"50\\"  Score - !scope=row   5th  Liverpool Ladies (h)  3–0 - !scope=row 6th  Sunderland Women (h)  4–0 - !scope=row  SF  Bristol Academy Women (n)  4–1 } As an FA WSL team, Birmingham City Ladies entered the competition in the fifth round, where they were drawn at home to Liverpool Ladies. They were rewarded for their first half performance on 26 minutes, when Jodie Taylor struck to put them a goal up. It was 2-0 just moments later after the half-time though, when Liverpool's goalie Aroon Clansey rushed from her line to deny Carney, only to see her header fall to Isobel Christiansen, who showed terrific instincts to volley into the unguarded net from around 35 yards out. With seconds left, the home side did increase their lead when a Chelsea Weston pass found its way to substitute Maz Ballard, who touched the ball past Clansey before poking the ball into the empty net from close range, to give Birmingham a 3-0 win. Birmingham faced Sunderland Women in the sixth round at Stratford Town. Kerys Harrop scored in the 22nd minute to give Birmingham the lead. Taylor very nearly bagged a second moments later – only for her goal-bound attempt to be saved by Sunderland 'keeper Rachael Laws. The hosts were able to coast through the remainder of the first-half, but still had the appetite for a third goal courtesy of Harrop. With Blues fully in control, Eniola Aluko added a fourth after 83 minutes, to give Birmingham a 4-0 victory. Bristol Academy Women were the opponents in the semi-final, held at Tamworth. Birmingham made the best possible start at Tamworth FC – taking the lead through Rachel William's header on nine minutes. An eventful start produced more drama shortly afterwards the opener, when Carney's goal-bound corner was handled on the line by Bristol Academy's Alex Culvin, leaving the referee no option but to brandish a red card. The Vixens were lucky not to receive further punishment, however, due to Williams hacking the resulting penalty wide. With David Parker's side firmly in the ascendancy, there was little action to speak of in the remainder of the first-half, that was until Carney bagged two quick fire braces shortly before the break. Williams' second was equally as emphatic – smashing home Jodie Taylor's looping cross. Mark Sampson's team grabbed a consolation courtesy of Laura del Río's strike late on, but this couldn’t take the gloss off a memorable day for the Ladies, but Birmingham secure their place in the final for the first time in the FA Women's Cup history. ===Chelsea Ladies=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;margin-left:1em;float:right\\" !scope=col width=\\"25\\"  Round !scope=col width=\\"200\\"  Opposition !scope=col width=\\"50\\"  Score - !scope=row   5th  Brighton & Hove Albion Women & Girls (h)  3–0 - !scope=row 6th  Doncaster Rovers Belles (a)  0–2 - !scope=row  SF  Arsenal Ladies (n)  2–0 } Chelsea Ladies – also a FA WSL team – entered the competition in the fifth round too. Their opening match was a 3–0 home win against Brighton & Hove Albion Women & Girls. After a goalless first half Dunia Susi struck early in the second, before Helen Bleazard and Sue Lappin scored to give Chelsea a 3–0 win. Chelsea were drawn to play at away against Doncaster Rovers Belles in the sixth round. From Sophie Ingle's corner kick, her high delivery was met at the far post by Gemma Bonner, who prodded home from a yard out to give Chelsea the advantage. From Danielle Buet's delivery, Bonner flicked onto Susi, who was not to be denied, meeting the ball with a powerful header into the top corner to secure Chelsea's place in the final four with a 2-0 win. Chelsea faced Arsenal Ladies in the semi-final at Brentford. Chelsea took the lead in stunning fashion midway through the first half. Winning the ball on the halfway line, winger Bleazard drove in from the left, before unleashing a superb 25-yard drive into the top corner to give the Blues the advantage. Stand-in skipper Susi almost doubled the Blues' advantage after racing clear to meet Dani Buet's through-ball, forcing Emma Byrne into a low save, and Chelsea also secure their place in the final for the first time in the FA Women's Cup history. ==Pre-match== The event represented a first final appearance for either club, as well as the first time the match had been held in Bristol. ==MatchSummary=== Helen Lander put Chelsea ahead in the 70th minute courtesy of a neat turn and finish and it looked for a long time that this solitary goal would be enough for glory, but Rachel Williams equalised in the 91st minute after Chelsea failed to clear a Karen Carney corner. The Londoners retook the lead in the first half of extra time through substitute Kate Longhurst, but the Blues bounced back once more when Carney converted a centrally-placed free-kick on the edge of the box. This goal forced the penalty shoot-out which they would eventually triumph in. Williams saw her kick saved by Carly Telford but Rachel Unitt, Jodie Taylor and Karen Carney all converted for the Midlanders. Chelsea's Drew Spence saw her penalty saved by Rebecca Spencer, Claire Rafferty hooked her penalty wide and Gemma Bonner blazed hers over the bar to hand The Cup to Birmingham. ===Details=== { width=92% -   } { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font- size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 22 Rebecca Spencer - RB 2  Chelsea Weston - CB 19 Emily Westwood - CB 6  Laura Bassett (c) - LB 17 Rachel Unitt - RM 10 Karen Carney - CM 14 Jade Moore - CM 11 Jo Potter - LM 3  Kerys Harrop   - AM 8  Rachel Williams - CF 14 Jodie Taylor - colspan=4Substitutes: - GK 1 Marie Hourihan - MF 7 Isobel Christiansen - FW 9 Eniola Aluko   - FW 20 Marie Ballard - FW 21 Cristina Torkildsen - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" David Parker } valign=\\"top\\"300px valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\" - !width=\\"25\\" !!width=\\"25\\" - GK 1  Carly Telford (c) - RB 2  Lara Fay   - CB 5  Gemma Bonner - CB 16 Sophie Ingle - LB 11 Claire Rafferty - RM 19 Laura Coombs   - CM 6  Katie Sherwood - LM 8  Danielle Buet - RW 17 Dunia Susi - LW 15 Helen Bleazard - CF 10 Helen Lander   - colspan=4Substitutes: - GK 18 Sarah Quantrill - DF 3  Sophie Perry   - MF 4  Drew Spence   - FW 7  Ashlee Hincks - FW 20 Kate Longhurst   - colspan=4Manager: - colspan=\\"4\\" Matt Beard } } { width=100% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  width=50% valign=top Player of the match *Karen Carney (Birmingham City Ladies) Match officials *Assistant referees: **Helen Conley (Durham) **Sian Piret (Oxfordshire) *Fourth official: Amy Fearn (Leicestershire)  width=50% valign=top Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra-time if necessary. *Penalty shoot-out if scores still level. *Five named substitutes. *Maximum of three substitutions. } ==See also== *2011–12 FA Women's Cup ==References== FA Category:Women's FA Cup finals FA Women's Cup Final, 2012 FA WSL Cup Final 2012 ","title":"2012 FA Women's Cup Final"},{"id":"35951521","text":"Eleanor of Vermandois also known as Eléonore de Vermandois (1148 or 1149 - 19 or 21 June 1213) was ruling countess of Vermandois in 1182-1213 and by marriage countess of Ostervant, Nevers, Auxerre, Boulogne and Beaumont. She was a daughter of Ralph I, Count of Vermandois, and his second spouse, Petronilla of Aquitaine. ==Early life== Eleanor was the youngest of three children born to her father by his second marriage. Eleanor's two older siblings were Ralph II, Count of Vermandois and Elisabeth, Countess of Vermandois. She had an older half-brother from her father's first marriage: Hugh II, Count of Vermandois. A couple of years after the birth of Eleanor, her parents divorced; her father remarried to Laurette of Flanders in 1152 but died later that same year. At the time of her birth, Eleanor was fourth in line to inherit the Vermandois title so therefore was not expected to inherit with two older brothers and a sister ahead of her in the line of succession. ==Marriages== Eleanor was married firstly in her mid-teens to Godfrey of Hainaut, Count of Ostervant, heir to his father Baldwin IV, Count of Hainaut. The couple married in 1162, however, Godfrey died the following year, whilst preparing for a journey to the territory of Palestine. Her second marriage in 1164 was to William IV, Count of Nevers; this marriage was also brief lasting only four years when William died at Acre in 1168 on crusade. A third marriage occurred in 1171 between Eleanor and Matthew, Count of Boulogne,Robert de Torigny, Vol. II, p. 20. who had divorced his first wife Marie, Countess of Boulogne the previous year. This marriage produced Eleanor's only child, a short lived daughter. No further children could be born as Matthew died in 1173 whilst fighting at the siege of Trenton (now Neufchatel-en-Bray); he was shot by an archer wielding a crossbow. A fourth marriage took place in 1175 to Matthew III, Count of Beaumont. They were married for seventeen years - Eleanor's longest marriage - but they had no children and in 1192, Matthew and Eleanor divorced. Eleanor had no surviving children from any of her four marriages. ==Countess== right Eleanor was originally fourth in line to the inheritance of the county, being her father's youngest child. However, her oldest brother Hugh II abdicated to become a monk in 1160, her second brother Ralph II died of leprosy in 1176, leaving no children and Eleanor's sister Elisabeth died in 1183. Her marriage to Philip I, Count of Flanders, had produced no children; therefore, Eleanor could then rightfully inherit the County of Vermandois.NORTHERN FRANCE NOBILITY, Medieval Lands Upon the death of Elisabeth, her widower Count Philip refused to pass over control of Vermandois to Eleanor; she then appealed to Philip II of France for support. Under the Treaty of Amiens on 20 March 1186, Eleanor retained Valois and part of Vermandois, calling herself at that point Countess of Valois, then upon the death of Philip in 1192, she inherited the rest of Vermandois on the condition that King Philip was able to annex Vermandois into the royal domain if Eleanor died without children.Medieval Lands From that point onward, Eleanor reigned solely over Vermandois.Kerrebrouck (2000), p. 540. Eleanor was remembered as a witty yet pious woman.Translation from German equivalent She founded the Abbey of Parc-aux-Dames in Auger-Saint-Vincent, she loved poetry and gave the minister Renaud impetus to the Constitution of the Roman de Sainte- Geneviève.Translation from German equivalent She also donated property to Notre-Dame by charter dated 1189.Ourscamp Notre-Dame CCXLVII, p. 149 Eleanor died childless in 1213 at the age of sixty after a 21-year rule over Vermandois, and she was buried in the Abbey of Longpont (today she is buried in Aisne).

In Zadar Bilan proved to be one of the most promising young centers in Croatia, becoming subject of interest from major clubs. As Zadar fell into financial troubles, failing to pay their players on time, Bilan one-sidely parted ways with the team. In August 2011, he signed a contract with Cedevita. Zadar suspended Bilan but eventually he won Croatian Basketball Federation arbitration dispute, allowing him to debut for Cedevita in September 2011. In July 2014, he extended his contract with Cedevita for one more season. On May 5, 2015, he agreed to a new two-year contract with Cedevita. The 2015–16 season was until then his most successful season. He was one of Cedevita's key players in its EuroLeague Top 16 run and was named ABA League MVP.

Welivita ceased being a director on 6 March 2011. CSN was issued a licence to broadcast on 3 March 2011. CSN started broadcasting on 7 March 2011, taking over the terrestrial frequencies and pay TV channels occupied by Prime TV Sri Lanka, a station operated by the state-owned Independent Television Network. The launch was celebrated by a special event held at the Atrium, Cinnamon Grand Hotel which was attended by Yoshitha Rajapaksa, Shiranthi Rajapaksa and Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage. From its creation, it had been speculated that CSN was owned by President Rajapaksa's family but those associated with the station denied this. In June 2012 Sri Lanka Cricket admitted that CSN was owned by President Rajapaksa's sons Yoshitha Rajapaksa and Namal Rajapaksa. ===Corruption investigations=== Yoshitha Rajapaksa and four others including Nishantha Ranatunga, Rohan Weliwita were remanded on 30 January 2016 until 11 February, over the alleged financial irregularities at the CSN. In August 2016 157.5 Million rupees were found and confiscated. Investigations revealed that the money has been deposited in a private bank under the name of a different company ==Tax== The network has been accused of misusing state funds under the former President of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa and having not paid any taxes to the government. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, who opened the debate on the interim budget, introduced a Super Gain tax to charge a levy from some companies that prospered disproportionately during the tenure of the previous government while making a minimum contribution to the economy. He cited CSN as an example and said it had neither paid the spectrum tax nor the electricity charges. \\"CSN has usurped the sports telecasting rights of the state-run television channels and misappropriated the fleet of vehicles assigned to the Presidential Security Division (PSD) for its business operations. That is how it has made huge profits,\\" the minister said adding that one-fourth of the income accrued by these companies will be charged as tax if they had made a profit of Rs.2,000 million or more during the financial year 2013/2014. ==Cricket broadcasting rights== Cricket is the most favourite sport of Sri Lanka and the rights to broadcast cricket can be very lucrative. Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation paid Rs 143 million ($1.1 million) for the rights to the 2011 Cricket World Cup but earned Rs 556 million ($4.3 million) in advertising. Broadcasting regulations had meant that international cricket matches could only be broadcast by the state-owned media in Sri Lanka. As a consequence state-owned Rupavahini had had a monopoly on broadcasting cricket in Sri Lanka since 1996 except for one year. In 2011 a cabinet decision was taken to amend the broadcasting regulations, allowing international cricket matches to be broadcast by either a state-owned broadcaster or a dedicated sports channel. Taking advantage of this, the newly formed CSN won the broadcasting rights to the Australian tour of Sri Lanka. Unusually, Rupavahini did not bid for the rights. In 2011 CSN was also awarded the broadcasting rights to the newly created Sri Lanka Premier League and the Pakistani and Sri Lanka tour of UAE. In May 2012 CSN was awarded the broadcasting rights for cricket for three years (2012–2015) for Rs 125 million ($1 million). It has been estimated that the rights should have cost the broadcaster at least Rs 3,000 million. CSN was the only bidder for the rights. It was highly unusual as previously rights had been awarded on a series-by-series basis. MTV Channel (Pvt) Ltd, which owns rival sports station MTV Sports, has threatened legal action alleging a number of irregularities and a conflict of interest with SLC secretary Nishantha Ranatunga being CSN CEO. The rights to telecast the 2015 ICC World Cup was removed from the channel by the new government and awarded to Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:English-language television stations in Sri Lanka Category:Sinhala- language television stations Category:Television channels and stations established in 2011 ","title":"Carlton Sports Network"},{"id":"35951610","text":"Sarabjit Ladda (born 10 July 1986) is an Indian cricketer who plays for Punjab in domestic cricket.Sarabjit Ladda - Cricinfo He is a right-handed batsman and a legbreak bowler.

The game is a sequel to the Strike games which began on the Sega Genesis with Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf. Soviet Strike is the series' first installment for a 32-bit console and was first conceived as 32-bit Strike. Early on, it was intended for the 3DO console, before development changed to the PlayStation. Soviet Strike is set after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and takes place in a fictionalised Russia, Eastern Europe and around the Caspian Sea. The player pilots an Apache helicopter and battles with the forces of Shadowman, a renegade ex-communist figure. Like its predecessors, the game features shooting action mixed with strategic management of fuel and ammunition, but has more authentic 3D graphics, as well as a modified overhead - as opposed to isometric - perspective. The game also features a more realistic enemy artificial intelligence and environment. Critics received the game positively, praising the graphics and full motion video, while commentary on the gameplay and difficulty was more mixed. It was released on the PlayStation Store in Japan on November 11, 2009 and in North America on September 14, 2010. ==Gameplay== The player's \\"Apache\\" flies over the burning ruins of a building to attack an enemy structure, behind which enemy troops can be seen. The player's fuel, ammunition and armour levels can be seen at either side of the screen. Soviet Strike is a helicopter-based shooter game. As in its predecessors, the player views the action from outside his craft, using one of two available viewpoints. These are similar to the isometric perspective of the previous games, but are improved \\"overhead\\" versions. This removes the predecessors' problem of buildings occasionally obstructing the player's view; and unlike the previous games, the player can no longer collide the helicopter into structures, instead always flying over them. The first camera system fixates on the Apache, while the second allows the player to rotate the screen around the helicopter. The Apache is armed with a machine gun, Hydra rockets and Hellfire missiles, which vary in power and payload. The Sega Saturn version includes two hidden power-up weapons: doubled machine guns and Maverick missiles. The craft has finite ammunition, fuel, and armour, and the player must manage the payload by collecting limited supplies. The game has five large levels, each divided into several missions. Mission objectives include seeking and destroying enemy personnel and structures such as radars, training camps and ships; rescuing prisoners-of-war and other persons (including, in the last mission, Boris Yeltsin), as well as recovering intercontinental ballistic missiles and capturing enemy commanders and agents. Soviet Strike employs a relatively realistic, fluid virtual battlefield and sophisticated artificial intelligence, which will put in motion set pieces even if the protagonist has not arrived to take part. The opposing intelligence can track the player using radar and reinforce positions accordingly. As such the player must sometimes pre-emptively destroy radars. Enemy troops may also flee once they have lost a battle. Some missions require set piece solutions, including starting an avalanche to crush a tank battalion and sealing a nuclear reactor core in a salt mine. The game is very tightly structured, yet the player has the ability to roam the battlefield attacking enemies at will. ==PlotCharacters=== The player is a helicopter pilot in STRIKE, a special covert operations force of the US military designed for preemptive action to prevent \\"wars that never happen.\\" STRIKE's commander is General Earle. Major STRIKE personnel include electronics expert Hack and agent Andrea Grey, whose cover job is a news reporter. The other protagonists are STRIKE pilot Nick Arnold, guerrilla fighter Amad, and former Soviet Army pilot Ivan Uralia. The game's antagonists are former KGB Chairman Uri \\"Shadowman\\" Vatsiznov, Ireki dictator Sadissa Savak, and disgraced Soviet scientist Dr Grymyenko Ukrainian. A series of voiceovers called STRIKE Files outline the origins of STRIKE. One such file has the Security Czar detailing the organization's mandate to US President Bill Clinton after his inauguration in January 1993. In the tape, Clinton is unaware that STRIKE prevented a civil war in Mexico in 1982 which could have turned the country into a secret Warsaw Pact member-state. ===Plot=== The end of the Soviet Union leaves a power vacuum in Eastern Europe that former KGB Chairman Uri Vatsiznov, a.k.a. the Shadowman, is willing to exploit for his own ends. In the first mission, which takes place in the Crimea, the player must rescue a captured STRIKE pilot named Nick Arnold. The second level is set in the Sea of Azov: the player must battle the elements of the Black Sea Fleet which is preparing to invade Europe. The mission also involves the rescue of guerrilla fighter Amad. STRIKE's victory in the Black Sea leads them to the Caucasus, where Sadissa Savak, leader of the fictional state of Irek, begins aggressive overtures against local fighters. In the mission (which is supposedly north of the main battle area where Desert Strike took place), the player and Amad join forces with a militia run by Amad's relatives in stopping Ireki troops from capturing an abandoned Soviet chemical weapons plant. With STRIKE killing Savak (and passed off as the victim of a car crash), the group goes to a heavily irradiated Transylvania to rescue Nick once more, this time from Dr Grymyenko Ukrainian, who wields an arsenal of ballistic missiles. The player is also tasked to kill the Shadowman's lead armor commander, Vila, who operates a special red-turreted T-80, and aid in the destruction of an abandoned nuclear reactor the Shadowman is planning to use. The final mission takes place in Moscow, with Shadowman's unleashing his minions in the KGB, the military and the Russian mafia in attempting a coup against President Boris Yeltsin's government. The player must prevent a bombing on the Kremlin before seeking out and killing Shadowman. The game's end sequence depicts Andrea delivering a televised news report blaming the destruction on an earthquake and consequent gas fires. ==Development== Soviet Strike began development as a game for the 3DO under the working title of 32-bit Strike. Strike series creator Mike Posehn assisted in early programming and the design but otherwise did not wish to work as part of a large team, necessitated by the move to a more advanced console. The development team, who had already spent several months working on the 3DO version, decided to rework it instead as a PlayStation game when it was clear that the 3DO's demise was inevitable; an additional two years' labor time was the result. The team re-evaluated the basics of the 16-bit games and aimed to create more lifelike environments and enemy behaviour. The 3D engine - created by the Road Rash 3DO team - used satellite images of real topography, imposed on polygonal maps. It also modified the preceding isometric viewpoint - which caused buildings to obstruct the player's view - to an overhead perspective with which the player could move and see over terrain and structures. In order to ensure proper spatial relations and unit placement, the team built three dimensional reliefs of each mission on sheets of plywood. Unlike some of its predecessors, Soviet Strike features only a helicopter - albeit with power-ups in some levels - and the team also abandoned the unpopular on-foot levels found in Urban Strike. The developers aimed to include more humour in the game, with other additions being voice- overs and full motion video. The later Saturn version featured a number of changes: an optional easy difficulty setting (providing the player with twice the fire-power and slower fuel consumption), adjustable brightness on the heads-up display; two hidden powerful weapons; hundreds of bug fixes from the PlayStation version; extra sound effects added to helicopters; improvements to the graphics of control and menu screens and compass; and more improvised fuel added to level 4. It was also compatible with the Saturn's then-recent analogue controllers. The game was followed by a further sequel, Nuclear Strike, released for the PlayStation in late 1997. ==Reception== Soviet Strike has an aggregate review score of 76.30% on Gamerankings for the PlayStation release, based on five reviews. Reviewers praised the realism of the terrain graphics. Next Generation said: \\"the game makes a giant leap forward in terms of the environment\\" but called the explosions \\"average\\", while other reviewers found them impressive. Jeff Gerstmann said the vehicles \\"look good\\", while another reviewer called the structures \\"highly realistic\\". Next Generation felt the structures and vehicles together with the terrain formed an \\"impressive\\" environment. The magazine felt the animation to be \\"average\\", and several other reviewers said that it sometimes gets choppy. GameFan's Saturn review summarised the graphics as \\"first-rate\\", while Russian magazine Great Drakon also praised them. Critics called the full motion video stylish, and praised the acting. Gerstmann said the FMV had \\"some of the best CD-ROM acting seen in a long time\\" and called it the game's \\"only real plus\\". Edge noted the new video but felt it was \\"over-the-top\\" and intrusive, while others disagreed. GamePro compared the FMV to Desert Storm if reported by MTV, saying its \\"hip new attitude\\" was \\"part of the charm\\", while another critic said the sequences \\"spice up the proceedings a fair bit\\". Great Drakon also praised the FMV. Reviewing the Saturn version, GameFan noted a poorer quality of FMV than in the PlayStation version. Gerstmann felt the sound to be \\"dull\\", while Next Generation called it \\"exemplary\\". Others praised the quality of the gunfire sound effects, and noted humour in the enemy troops' utterances. Gerstmann said it consisted of \\"a raw collection of messy operations\\", while Edge praised the game's \\"inventiveness\\" - saying it \\"makes Soviet Strike\\" - as well as the variety added by the games artificial intelligence. The magazine also felt that while the collecting of supplies added strategy to the action, the limited amount restricted the paths the player might take through the level. Another critic said the \\"real-time, living battlefield enhances the urgency of the missions and the player's involvement\\" and also noted \\"practically no load time.\\" GameFan complained of a high difficulty and a steep curve, long levels which return the player to the beginning should he die, infrequent opportunities to repair armour and the enemies' tendency to attack the player from beyond his limited viewpoint, and was thankful for the Saturn version's optional easier difficulty setting. Next Generation also criticised the player's restricted view, calling it the game's \\"worst problem\\". One reviewer said revisiting levels to discover missed set pieces aided the game's longevity; Sega Saturn Magazine had \\"some reservations\\" about the game's replay-value, with only 5 missions, but said it was \\"very playable and enjoyable\\", while another reviewer called it \\"a load of fun\\". Gerstmann criticised the poor scrolling, erratic motion and imprecise control, Great Drakon praised the controls, while GameFan noted they had improved in the Saturn version. The reviewer also enjoyed this version's new weaponry. Another reviewer pointed to some \\"minor flaws\\", saying the HUD \\"smacks of 16-bit era graphics\\"; GamePro said the game's one flaw was the lack of an HUD map to save the player the trouble of hitting pause whenever they need to check their position. The game impressed Great Drakon's reviewer, who praised the attention to detail and the reviewer found the story convincing. IGN said: \\"Everything about this game is great. Excuse me for gushing, but when you come across a game that's as fun to play as Soviet Strike, and great looking, you really sit up and take notice.\\" Gerstmann called the quality FMV \\"a small victory in a larger conflict\\", saying the game had \\"too many little problems to recommend it\\" and that it \\"simply doesn't play as well as the old 16-bit Strike games.\\" Sega Saturn Magazine called it a \\"worthy addition\\" to the series and also noted improvements to the Saturn version. They named it their \\"Game of the Month\\". GameFan said the game \\"is everything you could wish for from a 32bit Strike\\" and that \\"it plays brilliantly, and exercises both your trigger finger and grey matter.\\" The magazine later reflected that the Saturn version was somewhat better but nevertheless very similar to the PlayStation original. It recommended the game to Strike fans but felt it would be an \\"in at the deep end\\" introduction for newcomers to the series. Edge summarised: \\"this is a fairly well-engineered continuation of the four-year-old Strike series\\", which retains the gameplay of the original but updates the graphics to true 3D. Scary Larry of GamePro felt the game might be too slow for fans of faster paced action games, but recommended it for players of previous instalments in the series. Air Hendrix of the same magazine called it \\"An outstanding mix of white-knuckle combat and challenging strategy\\". Allgame later felt: \\"The series peaked with the release of Soviet Strike.\\" ==References== Category:1996 video games Category:Cancelled 3DO Interactive Multiplayer games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Shooter video games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in Russia Category:PlayStation Network games ","title":"Soviet Strike"},{"id":"35951650","text":"McCollin is a surname.

He was directly involved in two historic events: the first public use of chat by a Vice President of the United States and the first email sent from the North Pole. The bulk of Sussman's notable contributions to the Internet community occurred in the early to mid 90s while working for US News and The Washington Post. During the late 1990s and early 2000s Sussman worked on Internet and Web projects for America Online and Cahners Publishing. He also had a brief career as a speaker at conferences and corporate events, where he talked about the future of the Internet. ===At US News & World Report=== Sussman worked for U.S. News & World Report from 1989 to 1996. During the early 1990s he began covering the emerging Information Superhighway.

Teddy Kollek was one of the key figures behind its establishment. == Overview == Jerusalem Development Authority offices near Safra Square According to Ira Sharkansky, the mandate of the Jerusalem Development Authority involves \\"encouraging, planning, and initiating activities concerned with the economic development of Jerusalem and coordinating Jerusalem's economic development among government ministries, municipal officials, and other bodies.\\" Established as a statutory corporation through the Jerusalem Development Authority Law 1988, by 1992 the Authority had invested over $1 billion in construction projects and initiatives relating to science and technology in Jerusalem. The Authority was among the factors influencing the decision of Teva Pharmaceuticals in 2003 to build a facility in Jerusalem. Its largest investors, according to Sharkansky, have been prominent Jews from outside Israel. In 2001, Eden, a subsidiary of the Jerusalem Development Authority, was established with the aim of developing and reviving Jerusalem's downtown area. By early 2012, Eden had invested in development projects. Originally conceived as a ten-year operation, it was authorized to continue operating for an additional ten years. === Key people === Uziel Wexler Uziel (Uzi) Wexler, who earlier had served as treasurer of the Jerusalem municipality under mayor Teddy Kollek, founded the Jerusalem Development Authority in 1988 and served as its director from 1989 to 1994. He later served as the Authority's chairman from 1997 to 2003. Teddy Kollek was a key figure behind the Authority's establishment. Moshe Goldstein, once mayor of Ma'aleh Adumim, was chairman of the Authority for three years until 2008. Since 2008 is used Moshe Lion, former director general of the Prime Minister's Office and chairman of Israel Railways. In 2013, Lion resigned from his position in order to run for mayor of Jerusalem. As of 2018, Lion serves as mayor. Moty Hazan, who replaced Israel Bargil as director of the Jerusalem Development Authority in 2010, began his involvement with the Jerusalem municipality as a student in the mid-1990s working at the city's call center. Over time he was promoted to a position with the treasury department's budget committee and later to the position of deputy treasurer. Credited for his contribution to balancing the city's budgets and for his involvement in the city's recovery program, by 2010 he was City Hall's preferred candidate for the position of director of the Authority. === International cooperation === The Jerusalem Development Authority reached an agreement in 2005 to collaborate with a firm in the Netherlands to promote innovation in the fields of biotechnology, information technology and tourism. The joint venture was conceived as part of the Israel–Europe R&D; Directorate. During a five-day mission to Israel of figures from San Antonio, Texas' business and academic community in 2011, led by San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, the Jerusalem Development Authority's BioJerusalem signed a memorandum of intent with the president of , a San Antonio-based nonprofit initiative operating in the healthcare and bioscience sectors. == Initiatives  BioJerusalem === In 2003 the Jerusalem Development Authority, together with Teva Pharmaceuticals and other investors, founded BioLineRx, a drug development company with headquarters in Jerusalem. In 2006, with additional funding from its investors, BioLineRx launched BioLine Innovations Jerusalem, Israel's first biotechnology incubator. The Jerusalem Development Authority announced the launch of BioJerusalem in mid-2007. The initiative offers monetary incentives to biotechnology companies who relocate their facilities to Jerusalem or set up operations there. === AcademiCity === In cooperation with Ruach Hadasha, a student-oriented nonprofit, and in an effort to encourage students to remain in Jerusalem after having completed their academic studies, as of 2009 the Jerusalem Development Authority acts as an interface between college and university graduates and more than 100 Jerusalem-based institutions offering internship programs. In addition, students are offered benefits and monetary incentives if they choose to live downtown and commit to remaining in the city after completing their studies. In 2011 a plan by the Jerusalem Development Authority to expand and restructure Jerusalem's academic landscape was announced. Dubbed AcademiCity (), the plan called for the construction of a school for overseas students in downtown Jerusalem, the relocation to Jerusalem of Hebrew University's Agricultural Department in Rehovot, the establishment in Jerusalem of a branch of the Israel Defense Forces' Command and Staff College, and the establishment of a Machon Lev campus for girls in Jerusalem's Pisgat Ze'ev neighborhood. === Hamshushalayim === Hamshushalayim () is an annual cultural festival initiated by the Jerusalem Development Authority together with the Prime Minister's Office and the Jerusalem municipality. The festival takes its name from the word hamshush, military slang meaning \\"weekend beginning on Thursday,\\" combined with the Hebrew name for Jerusalem, Yerushalayim. It lasts for three weekends during the month of December and includes free entrance to museums, guided tours, musical performances, and discounted hotels. 480,000 people were drawn to hamshushalayim in 2008. === Jerusalem Festival of Lights === \\"Cupola\\" by Luminarie De Cagna, outside Jaffa Gate (2012) The Jerusalem Festival of Lights is a joint initiative of the Jerusalem Development Authority, the Jerusalem Municipality, the Prime Minister's Office, and the Ariel Company. First launched in 2009, the festival takes place annually in and around Jerusalem's Old City and features works of light art created by various artists. == Projects  Jerusalem parks === The Jerusalem Development Authority has proposed the creation of a network of green areas to surround the northern and eastern parts of the Old City of Jerusalem. The areas, totaling 2,500 dunams (600 acres) in size, would include bike paths and hiking paths making it possible to reach the Pool of Siloam from Mount Scopus. *The King's Garden archeological park is a 12-acre park proposed for development in what is today the Arab neighborhood of al-Bustan in East Jerusalem's Silwan neighborhood. The designated area is widely accepted as the site of the garden mentioned in the Song of Songs book of the Hebrew Bible. The plan for the park calls for the demolition of 22 Palestinian homes constructed without permits on land originally zoned as parkland while legalizing 66 others. The Secretary General of the United Nations said the removal of the 22 homes would itself be illegal. *The Slopes of Mount Scopus national park is a 73.2-hectare (181-acre) park proposed for development in the hills between the Arab neighborhoods of Isawiya and at-Tur in East Jerusalem. Most of the land is privately owned by residents of the two neighborhoods. The proposal was opposed by city council member Meir Margalit, who called it a pretext for the future establishment of Israeli settlements. The Jerusalem Development Authority has said the park is important in order to preserve the Isawiya–a-Tur area's last remaining stretch of undeveloped land, to safeguard it from acts of vandalism, and to develop tourism. === Jerusalem Old City walls === Damascus Gate, September 2011, shortly after the Jerusalem Development Authority's restoration work The Jerusalem Development Authority administered the Jerusalem City Walls Conservation Project in cooperation with the Prime Minister's Office and the Israel Antiquities Authority beginning in 2007. Within the framework of the project, by the summer of 2011 half of the Old City walls had undergone cleaning and restoration treatment. Six months of restoration work performed at Zion Gate culminated in a moving rededication ceremony in July 2008 attended by veterans of the Palmach, 468 years after the gate had originally been built. Two months of restoration work performed at Jaffa Gate were completed in April 2010, and an official rededication ceremony was held to mark the occasion, 472 years after the gate was first dedicated. The restoration of Herod's Gate was completed in June 2010, whereupon a reinauguration ceremony was held attended by the Old City's Nawar mukhtar, Abed-Alhakim Mohammed Deeb Salim. The restoration work at Damascus Gate, lasting more than a year and completed in August 2011, involved the reconstruction of part of a crenellated turret damaged in the Six-Day War. The project, lasting a total of five years, was declared complete in September 2012 after restoration work performed at Lions' Gate – the seventh and last gate to be restored – was concluded. === Einstein museum === In 2012 the Israeli Cabinet approved the establishment in Jerusalem of a museum dedicated to the legacy of Albert Einstein. A joint project of Hebrew University and the Jerusalem Development Authority, the museum will showcase thousands of documents currently stored at Hebrew University illustrating among other things Einstein's extensive involvement in the Zionist movement in the 1900s. === Safdie Plan === The Safdie Plan was a project initiated by the Israel Land Administration and the Jerusalem Development Authority during the term of Ehud Olmert as mayor of Jerusalem. It called for the construction of 20,000 housing units on undeveloped land to the west of the city. Environmentalists mobilized to have the Safdie Plan scrapped, and it was suspended by Mayor Uri Lupolianski in 2007. == See also == *Erel Margalit == References  External links == *BioJerusalem *ISERD—The Israel–Europe R&D; Directorate *Jerusalem Development Authority Law, 5748—1988 – published by the Israel Law Resource Center Category:Economy of Jerusalem Category:Organizations established in 1988 Category:Organizations based in Jerusalem Category:1988 establishments in Israel ","title":"Jerusalem Development Authority"},{"id":"35951675","text":"Anton Edthofer (1883–1971), Austrian actor Anton Franz Edthofer (18 September 1883 – 21 February 1971) was an Austrian actor. ==Partial filmography== * The Sacrifice (1918) * Freier Dienst (1918) - Landovsky * Maria Magdalena (1919) * The Eyes of the World (1920) - Heinz Kay * Moj (1920) - Josef Tschamberl * The Secret of Bombay (1921) - Schiffsarzt Vittorio * Four Around a Woman (1921) - Werner Krafft - William Krafft sein Zwillingsbruder * The Love Corridor (1921) - Graf Troll * Eine Frau mit Vergangenheit (1921) * Hazard (1921) - Ihr Bruder, der Gentleman Dieb * Playing with Fire (1921) * The Oath of Stephan Huller (1921) - Friedrich Huller * Father Won't Allow It (1921) - Toni Biebelhuber * Barmaid (1922) - Dr. Harry Dorn * Countess Walewska (1922) - Graf D'Evians, zeitweiliger Adjutant * Insulted and Humiliated (1922) * Shadows of the Past (1922) - Jens Holmberg - Artist * Phantom (1922) - Wigottschinski * Nora (1923) - Dr. Rank * Fridericus Rex - 3.

It was the first Daimler product for more than two decades with an engine that breathed conventionally through poppet valves. Conventional valve gear had improved, superseding the former advantages of the Daimler-Knight sleeve-valve technology. The car's name derived from its tax rating of 15 hp.RAC Rating The design of its 6-cylinder 1.8-litre engine was developed from the 4-cylinder 1.2-litre Lanchester Ten which was installed in Lanchester's shorter versions of the same chassis and bodies and using the same Daimler semi-automatic transmissions. The Fifteen was the first Daimler to be offered at less than £500 since World War I. The Great Depression of the 1930s was well established and Daimler, responsible for economical BSA three-wheelers and, from 1931, the mid-price Lanchester range, went downmarket to assist sales in the austere times. Perhaps it took twenty years but this risky strategy with the Daimler name may have lost Daimler its super-luxury reputation and eventually brought about its demise. In August 1934, in anticipation of the reduction in annual tax charge, the Fifteen was given a larger 2-litre engine. Again in August 1936 the engine was increased to 2.2-litres then another two years later to a full 2½-litres. ==Pricing== * Standard chassis £350 * Six-light saloon with sliding roof £450 * Coupé £465 Daimler 15 (1935) (16005338012).jpg6-light saloon 1934 Daimler Model 15 (Front).jpgfixed-head coupé 1934 Daimler Model 15.jpg 1935 Daimler 15 Sportsman Saloon 10275915163.jpg 1935 Daimler 15 Sportsman Saloon 10275786616.jpg 1933 Daimler Light 15 4385552170.jpg2-door drophead coupé Daimler 15 Martin Walters Wingham Cabriolet (1936) (15959827332).jpg4-door all-weather tourer ==Design and specificationsEngine=== The long-stroke engine's six cylinders and upper half of the crankcase are all in one block, like the detachable cylinder head, of cast-iron. The head carries the valves and rocker gear operated by pushrods from the chain-driven camshaft running in an oil bath within the block below. The pistons are of aluminium alloy. The crankshaft runs in four bearings and has a vibration damper. Lubrication is fully forced including to the gudgeon pins. Cold starting conditions are provided for by splash lubrication to all vital parts. There are separate inlet and exhaust manifolds on the offside (left) with a hotspot. Cooling water circulates naturally to the radiator. A mechanical fuel pump delivers petrol from a tank at the back of the car. Automatic engine starting is not needed as, owing to the fluid flywheel, the engine cannot be stalled in the ordinary way. ===Transmission=== Gear selector lever The transmission consists of the Daimler fluid flywheel and its Wilson self-changing pre-selective, four-speed gearbox. An open propellor shaft takes the power to an underslung, worm-driven back axle. The pre-selective finger-and-thumb lever for choosing gears is under the steering wheel and may be worked by the left hand. ===Chassis=== Engine, fluid flywheel and gearbox are assembled as one unit held at four points with rubber. The two back bearers are on the forward parts of the X-member of the chassis frame. The springs are all semi-elliptic and are supplied with hydraulic shock absorbers. The springs are set wide to minimise any tendency to roll. On the radius-rod-controlled front axle they are shackled forwards, flat, splayed and held out of centre. The back springs are under the axle and outside the chassis frame. Hydraulic four-wheel brakes by Lockheed are fitted with a vacuum servo. The frame passes below the rear springs to allow a low floor without wells within the floorboards. The tyres on the wheels have a section of Steering is by cam. ===Engine upgrade for 1935=== A redesigned cylinder head and an increase in cubic capacity to 2003 cc by adding 10 mm to the already lengthy stroke was claimed to have improved performance by 10% to 15%. It did not affect the tax rating of the engine. The opportunity was taken to make a number of small improvements including the provision of a water pump and thermostatic control of the coolant circulation. The top gear mechanism of the gearbox was also improved to avoid a hum when the car was idling in neutral. The complete car was now stated to weigh 25.25 cwt. Wheels and tyres were now wheels with a tyre section of ==Facelift for 1936== The August 1935 announcement from Daimler was that the coachwork of the standard saloons was redesigned. The swept tail of the new six-light saloon now covered the spare wheel. The new bodies were appreciably wider. The special independent assembly of the radiator and front wings was applied to the Fifteen as previously applied to the new Daimler Light Twenty announced on 12 July 1935. 6-light saloon 6-light saloon 4-light sports saloon A number of important improvements were made to the front part of the chassis though it retained the same dimensions. Suspension and steering were changed. To reduce fore and aft movement as much as possible the front springs were lengthened and made more supple in order to bring their periodicity nearer that of the rear springs. Steering was changed to the worm and nut system. The steering column was made adjustable for reach. Centralised automatic chassis lubrication and easy jacking facilities were now installed. ==Enlarged engine for 1937== Various enhancements were announced in August 1936. The principal feature was the increase in engine size from 2.003 to 2.166-litres. The rear track was widened by 1½ inches but the wheel base remained the same. Fully chromium-plated bumpers were provided instead of the previous black and chromium edged type and the standardization of Magna type wheels with large section tyres helped the appearance of the car. The instrument board and other interior woodwork were redesigned. The windscreen was centrally controlled and was given dual wipers working from the bottom. The rear quarter windows were hinged to open. The upholstery was redesigned and could be had in all leather or in a combination of cloth and leather. The spare wheel was covered and there was a wide range of new colour schemes. The new range of coachwork included: *Six-window saloons with either fully panelled or leather-cloth roofs and quarters as preferred; £465 *Four-window sports saloon with distinctive lines; £475 *A two-door four-window four-seater coupé; £465 *Chassis alone; £350 The following bodies continued to be available in addition to the standard coachwork: *Martin Walter Wingham four-door cabriolet £555 *Tickford two-door cabriolet £550 by Salmons *Tickford four-door cabriolet £600 by Salmons ==ReferencesExternal links== Fifteen Category:Cars introduced in 1932 Category:1930s cars ","title":"Daimler Fifteen"},{"id":"35951701","text":"Concerto is the twenty-fourth episode of the third series of the 1960s cult British spy-fi television series The Avengers, starring Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman.

Written by Charles Arthur Powell and Paul Franklin, the film is about a cattle inspector's efforts to prevent a corrupt cattle rancher from shipping to market a herd of cattle infected with hoof and mouth disease.Magers, pp. 127–128. ==Plot== A corrupt cattle rancher, Belknap (Walter Miller), and a cattle broker, H.R. Shelby (Gordon Hart), learn that their livestock have contracted the deadly hoof and mouth disease. They scheme to ship their herd to market before the agricultural inspector, Gene Autry, learns of the infection. That night, as Gene escorts Martha Wheeler (June Storey) to a square dance, Belknap and Shelby load their infected cattle onto a truck. Gene's sidekick, Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette), discovers a dead calf and hurries to the dance to alert Gene. Gene, Frog, and Martha's father Jim Wheeler (George Cleveland), who is also a cattle rancher, leave the dance to investigate, but Jim becomes separated from Gene and Frog and soon discovers the truck bearing the diseased cattle. A gun battle ensues and Jim is badly wounded. Hearing the gunshots, Gene rushes to his rescue. In the chaos, the truck driver slips away to the Belknap ranch. The next morning, Belknap and Shelby try to agitate the other ranchers by claiming that a quarantine is unfair. Gene, however, puts an end to their argument by announcing that a state veterinarian, Dr. Sommers (Jack Mulhall), is on his way. Alarmed at what the vet will find, Belknap and Shelby change the brand on their cattle to Jim Wheeler's brand and bury the dead animals on the Wheeler property. When Dr. Sommers arrives, he quarantines Jim's herd and allows the other ranchers to begin shipping their animals. Suspicious of Belknap, Gene tries to warn the vet, but is ignored. Looking for evidence, Gene and Frog ride to the Belknap ranch, where Gene discovers the sick cattle in the barn. Before Gene can return with Sommers, however, Belknap moves the cattle. Confronted with Belknap's empty barn, Sommers orders the Wheeler cattle destroyed. When Gene tries to stop the order, Dr. Sommers has him arrested for assault. While Gene languishes in jail, Frog sees the burial of dead cattle on the Belknap ranch and hurries to help Gene escape. After Frog lands in jail himself, he and Gene are rescued by a medicine man's elephant, which pulls the bars from the jail window. As the posse rides to destroy Jim's herd, Gene and Frog present the sheriff with evidence that leads to Belknap's arrest and a clean bill of health for Jim's cattle. ==Cast== * Gene Autry as Gene Autry * Smiley Burnette as Frog Millhouse * June Storey as Martha Wheeler * George Cleveland as Jim Wheeler * Jack Mulhall as Dr. Sommers * Walter Miller as Belknap * Gordon Hart as H.R.

He held office as Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer and as English Chancellor of the Exchequer, and acquired considerable wealth as a result.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.i p. 25 Harvington, Worcestershire, Adam's birthplace, present day ==Family== He derived his name from his birthplace, Harvington, Worcestershire; he was the son of William de Harvington or de Herwynton.Ball p.66 His close association with Pershore Abbey suggests that William de Harvington, Abbot of Pershore 1307-40, was his relative. Pershore Abbey, of which Adam was a notable benefactor ==Career== His path to high office lay through the patronage of Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick (died 1315). It was probably Warwick who obtained for him the position of Deputy Chamberlain of the Exchequer in 1298 and persuaded Edward I to grant him the manor of Talton, Worcestershire, in 1303.Ball p.66 He was given the living of Awre, Gloucestershire in 1305 and of Hanslope in 1316. He was an executor of Warwick's will in 1315 and was given a lease of certain of his lands for fifteen years. In his own will he made clear his great sense of obligation to the Earl.Willis-Bund, J.W.

Adam became Keeper of the Rolls of the Bench at Westminster in 1314 and was a Commissioner of oyer and terminer 1314-1322.Ball p.67 Any setback he may have suffered in his career after Lancaster's downfall and execution for treason in 1322 was temporary: he seems to have been regarded as a valued and hard working Crown official.Haines p.89 He was sent to Ireland as Chief Baron in 1324,Ball p.25 and was briefly Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland; he returned to England as Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1327. ==Last years== He retired to his native Worcestershire in 1330. In his last years he was a noted benefactor of Pershore Abbey. Ball gives his date of death as 1337,Ball p.67 but this is probably a mistake, since he made a conveyance of land in 1342; he was certainly dead by 1346. In his will he left money to Pershore Abbey to erect a chantry to pray for his soul and that of his first patron Guy, Earl of Warwick.Willis-Bund, Page pp.127-136 ==References== Category:People from Worcestershire Category:Chancellors of the Exchequer Category:14th-century English people Category:Chief Barons of the Irish Exchequer Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"Adam de Harvington"},{"id":"35951786","text":"McConnachie is a surname.

The ships arrived at Sydney on 7 September, and for the next five years Kent was employed in the service of the colony, making voyages to Norfolk Island and the Cape of Good Hope, and surveying parts of the coast of New South Wales.

He was to go on to Calcutta and bring back as many cows as possible of the best breed. On 19 May he made the south-west coast of New Caledonia, and discovered a harbour, which he named Port St Vincent (Saint Vincent Bay), where he remained for several weeks. In January 1804 Kent was at Calcutta, and returned to Port Jackson in June, bringing back cattle and other stores.

The novel was originally published in 1991, though the title was changed to Lights, Camera, Disaster in 2003. ==Plot== A movie production project from Hollywood moves to Macdonald Hall so they can use the school as a backdrop for their movie, Academy Blues. Upon hearing that the director, Seth Dinkman, is willing to use students in crowd scenes, Bruno tries multiple times to ask the director to get into a crowd scene, but Dinkman rejects him due to Bruno's garishness. Desperate to get in the movie, Bruno tries multiple times to disguise himself so he could sneak in, but Dinkman complains to Mr. Sturgeon, who as a result, punishes Bruno by forbidding him to be involved in the movie. Bruno begins developing contempt for the teenage star of the movie, Jordie Jones, especially because the girls at Miss Scrimmage's Finishing School go crazy about him. Angrily, he decides to play a prank on Jordie by hiding fireworks around the trailer that he sleeps in and setting them off on his birthday to scare him. Upon setting up the plan, they discover that Jordie is actually crying because he was lonely, and nobody remembered it was his birthday. Feeling sorry for him, Bruno cancels the fireworks prank and decide to throw him a birthday party the next night, while Boots sleeps in Jordie's trailer to fool security. The next night, the girls at Miss Scrimmage's decide to capture Jordie. They enter Jordie's trailer and wrap the body inside a blanket, without knowing that it was actually Boots and not Jordie. After carrying Boots into the school, they unwrap the blanket and Boots is revealed. The girls angrily leave and Boots ends up stranded there. Miss Scrimmage catches him but thinks Boots was the one intruding and marches him back to Macdonald Hall at gunpoint. Eventually Bruno discovers Boots is in trouble, and wakes up Mr. Sturgeon, who breaks Miss Scrimmage's shotgun. Jordie gratefully goes to Mr. Sturgeon to defend them and explain to them about the party, resulting in Mr. Sturgeon changing his mind about punishing Bruno and Boots. Jordie is grateful about the birthday party, he talks director Dinkman into giving Bruno another chance, but Bruno messes up again. Later, the team goes to practice for the final hockey game against York Academy, and upon hearing that Jordie also plays hockey, invites him to play with them. Careful not to not reveal Jordie's true identity to Coach Flynn, they get him to play goalie so he can wear a mask. Later, the boys go to Miss Scrimmage’s school dance. Jordie is eager to go, but he is disguised as a prince from a foreign country. However, in the dance, Calvin Fihzgart's cologne causes Jordie to sneeze violently, blowing his cover. Chaos ensues when the girls desperately try to reach him while the boys desperately try to defend him, putting Jordie in danger. Miss Scrimmage, Dinkman, and Jordie’s overprotective manager Goose Golden become very upset about the incident, so Mrs. Sturgeon decides to invite them over for dinner so they can settle their differences. Mr. Sturgeon tells Dinkman that Jordie is being overprotected, so Dinkman agrees to give Jordie the ability to socialize with the students without having to do so in secrecy. Thus, Jordie is given the ability to help the team practice for the hockey game every day after school. Meanwhile, Jordie talks Dinkman into giving Bruno a final chance to be in the movie, but Bruno messes up yet again. Later, the team goes to play the hockey match against York Academy, with Jordie attending as a spectator. However, when goalie Pete Anderson gets knocked out, the team is in dire needed of a backup goalie. Jordie volunteers and goes into the game to play. They would end up winning, but Jordie ends up getting a black eye after his mask falls off and he gets hit by the puck. With Jordie’s black eye, the movie production team is no longer able to continue shooting the movie, so Jordie ends up being forced to promote the movie non-stop with 24-hour interviews, and Bruno now has to go to prepare for a mandatory five-day camping trip to Algonquin Park. The day before the camping trip, Bruno makes one last attempt to sneak into the movie when he gets Boots to successfully divert the stuntman that was supposed to shoot that scene. Bruno, disguised as the stuntman, successfully performs the stunt, but he gets rejected after his wig falls off and Dinkman discovers his true identity. Bruno and the boys go off to the camping trip, but to their surprise, Jordie sneaks along due to him feeling imprisoned by the never-ending requests to do interviews. When the teachers supervising the camp, Mr. Flynn and Mr. Fudge, discover the presence of Jordie, they try to send him back by getting Mr. Fudge to find a route back to the highway. However, Mr. Fudge ends up lost, so they try to be rescued by building an S.O.S. raft. Meanwhile, back at Macdonald Hall, Goose Golden is the first to discover the disappearance of Jordie Jones. Despite being told by Dinkman to keep it a secret, he accidentally spills it, resulting in the school turning into a media circus as hundreds of news reporters settle at the campus, demanding answers. Mr. Sturgeon, annoyed by the circus, decides to drive to Algonquin Park himself to bring back Jordie. Meanwhile, Cathy Burton, a student at Scrimmage’s, immediately realizes that Jordie has gone on the camping trip. Miss Scrimmage is supposed to take Cathy and the members of the Baking Club to Montreal the next day, but Cathy, knowing that Miss Scrimmage prints out road directions when travelling, replaces them with the directions to Algonquin Park. Mr. Sturgeon goes to drive to Algonquin Park the very next morning, and after desperate pleading from Goose Golden, reluctantly agrees to take Golden with him. As soon as they arrive at Algonquin Park, Golden regrets his decision immediately, having come completely unprepared. Meanwhile, Miss Scrimmage also drives the girls to Algonquin Park, thinking that she is actually driving to Montreal. Eventually Miss Scrimmage notices that something is wrong with the road, but the girls are able to successfully convince her to go on the camping trip. So they go on a hike in the forest to find Jordie. Excited about finally being able to meet Jordie, Cathy begins shrieking in excitement. Bruno and the boys on the camping trip hear the shrieks, but Elmer Drimsdale, the school genius, insists that the shriek was the sound of a leopard. They decide to climb onto the S.O.S. raft, knowing that leopards are afraid of water. At first, Mr. Flynn was reluctant to believe Elmer, but after the shrieks increase in volume, everybody becomes convinced. Mr. Sturgeon and Goose Golden find them and also climb onto the raft. Just as the shrieks became at their loudest, everybody discovers that the shrieks actually came from Cathy. Soon after, a helicopter descends from the sky with Seth Dinkman inside, and everybody is rescued safely. The movie crew returns to Macdonald Hall where they can shoot two more scenes: the final scene of the movie where they have to set off some explosives by pushing a plunger to blow up the model of the school building, and the bicycle stunt scene which Bruno hijacked. However, they connect the wrong wires, and end up setting off a firework that Bruno forgot to dismantle after cancelling the plan to prank Jordie earlier in the novel. The firework destroys the emergency brakes for Jordie’s trailer (with Goose Golden inside), and the trailer rolls down a hill and destroys the model. Meanwhile, the stuntman who was supposed to do the bicycle stunt ends up injuring himself trying to escape the trailer, thus resulting in Bruno achieving his dream of finally being part of the movie. ==CharactersMacdonald Hall=== *Bruno Walton - The student who desperately tries to sneak into the movie.

It bills itself as \\"the oldest and largest statewide manufacturing trade association in the United States.\\" Based in Oak Brook, Illinois, and founded in 1893 by businessmen opposed to legislation limiting the working hours of women, IMA has more than 4000 member companies. The association lobbies on behalf of Illinois manufacturing interests and has its own political action committee and polling organization. IMA's President and CEO is Mark Denzler. The IMA publishes a quarterly magazine, The Illinois Manufacturer. ==History== On September 29, 1893, Illinois manufacturers met at the Grand Pacific Hotel to organize in opposition to the Sweatshop Law of 1893 that prohibited child labor and mandated an eight-hour workday. The manufacturers formed the Illinois Manufacturers' Protective Association \\"for the purpose of co-operating to test the constitutionality of a recent act of the Legislature of this State limiting the hours of Female Labor.\\"Sklar, pp. 254-255 Governor Peter Altgeld had made Florence Kelley the Chief Factory Inspector for the state of Illinois.Sklar, p. 463 The Manufacturers' Protective Association sponsored a number of cases which led to the Illinois Supreme Court finding that Section 5 of the Act, which limited women's working weeks to 48 hours and their day to eight hours, unconstitutional in 1895. After Governor Altgeld was not re- elected in 1896 and Kelley was removed from her position, flagrant violations of the child labor provision were reported. During the Coal Strike of 1919, the Illinois Manufacturers' Association announced a boycott against the striking coal miners, holding up orders of food, clothing and fuel for mining communities. Earlier that year, the IMA had asked the House Interstate Commerce Committee to outlaw railroad strikes or lockouts. The Illinois Manufacturers' Association attempted to keep the Chicago labor radio station WCFL off the air in 1926 by protesting the use of Navy Pier as the station's transmitter and broadcasting site. In 1935, the IMA opposed the Social Security Act, which it said would increase unemployment. IMA commissioned a study by Fantus in 1975 that addressed state-by-state business climate in the United States. The study was criticized for its heavy emphasis on unions and taxes in its formulations. The IMA considered a merger with the Illinois Chamber of Commerce in 2000. In 2010, Janice Christiansen became the first woman to become chair of the IMA Board of Directors. That year, IMA President Greg Baise was required to testify at a Bloomington trial regarding an alleged corporate conspiracy to conceal the hazards of asbestos. In 2012, the IMA spoke out in favor of Illinois' enterprise zones and was a vocal member of the STOP Coalition, which opposed the construction of a coal power plant with pollution mitigation in Taylorville by Tenaska Energy. The association also supported plastic bag recycling. ==Political influence== According to the IMA website, the association has influenced legislation resulting in corporate tax and sales tax breaks for its members of $300 million annually. The association reviews bills introduced to the Illinois General Assembly and maintains a Legislative Watch List where it indicates its support or opposition to individual bills. In 2012, the IMA opposed bills that would require health insurance to cover pre-existing conditions, tie the minimum wage to the consumer price index, and provide coverage for maternity care and sick leave. The IMA also supported bills that would release employers from the obligation to pay workers compensation to employees that were discharged for cause, create an Illinois Health Benefits Exchange as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and amend the Employee Classification Act so that the term \\"employment\\" does not apply to truck drivers. In 2010, the IMA advocated tax exemptions for manufacturers. IMA President Mark Denzler is an employer representative of Illinois' Workers Compensation Advisory Board and has hosted a weekly poker game in his office frequented by state legislators. The Illinois Manufacturers' Association has its own political action committee called Manufacturers PAC or MPAC. The Illinois Manufacturers' Association owns the for-profit subsidiary Xpress Professional Services, which conducts opinion polls through its polling organization, We Ask America.

According to this hypothesis, scientific progress occurs mainly by the accumulation of a mass of modest, narrowly specialized intellectual contributions. On this view, major breakthroughs draw heavily upon a large body of minor and little-known work, without which the major advances could not happen. == Citation research == The Ortega hypothesis is widely held, but a number of systematic studies of scientific citations have favored the opposing \\"Newton hypothesis\\", which says that scientific progress is mostly the work of a relatively small number of great scientists (after Isaac Newton's statement that he \\"stood on the shoulders of giants\\"). The most important papers mostly cite other important papers by a small number of outstanding scientists, suggesting that the breakthroughs do not actually draw heavily on a large body of minor work. Rather, the pattern of citations suggests that most minor work draws heavily on a small number of outstanding papers and outstanding scientists. Even minor papers by the most eminent scientists are cited much more than papers by relatively unknown scientists; and these elite scientists are clustered mostly in a small group of elite departments and universities. The same pattern of disproportionate citation of a small number of scholars appears in fields as diverse as physics and criminology. The matter is not settled. No research has established that citation counts reflect the real influence or worth of scientific work. So, the apparent disproof of the Ortega hypothesis may be an artifact of inappropriately chosen data. Stratification within the social networks of scientists may skew the citation statistics. Many authors cite research papers without actually reading them or being influenced by them. Experimental results in physics make heavy use of techniques and devices that have been honed by many previous inventors and researchers, but these are seldom cited in reports on those results. Theoretical papers have the broadest relevance to future research, while reports of experimental results have a narrower relevance but form the basis of the theories. This suggests that citation counts merely favor theoretical results. == The name == The name of the hypothesis refers to José Ortega y Gasset, who wrote in The Revolt of the Masses that \\"astoundingly mediocre\\" men of narrow specialties do most of the work of experimental science. Ortega most likely would have disagreed with the hypothesis that has been named after him, as he held not that scientific progress is driven mainly by the accumulation of small works by mediocrities, but that scientific geniuses create a framework within which intellectually commonplace people can work successfully. For example, Ortega thought that Albert Einstein drew upon the ideas of Immanuel Kant and Ernst Mach to form his own synthesis, and that Einstein did not draw upon masses of tiny results produced systematically by mediocrities. According to Ortega, science is mostly the work of geniuses, and geniuses mostly build on each other's work, but in some fields there is a real need for systematic laboratory work that could be done by almost anyone. The \\"Ortega hypothesis\\" derives only from this last element of Ortega's theory, not the main thrust of it. Ortega characterized this type of research as \\"mechanical work of the mind\\" that does not require special talent or even much understanding of the results, performed by people who specialize in one narrow corner of one science and hold no curiosity beyond it. == References == Category:Sociology of scientific knowledge Category:Science studies ","title":"Ortega hypothesis"},{"id":"35952028","text":"Chief Kaniuhu (Hawaiian: Aliʻi Kaniuhu) was an ancient Hawaiian noble and the High Chief (Hawaiian: Aliʻi Nui) of the Island of Hawaiʻi (the Big Island).

West Bengal is a state in the eastern region of India and is the nation's fourth-most populous. The state capital is Kolkata. The state encompasses two broad natural regions: the Gangetic Plain in the south and the sub-Himalayan and Himalayan area in the north. The tourism in West Bengal is maintained by WBTDCL, a state government owned enterprise. West Bengal, located on eastern bottleneck of India stretching from the Himalayas in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south, presents some of marvelous landscape features and natural scenic beauty. Some of India's most preferred travel destinations like; the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region in the northern extreme of the state, the highest peak of the state Sandakphu () and the Sundarbans mangrove forests in the extreme south. Darjeeling Himalayan Railway or Toy Train is West Bengal's third wonder During the British colonial era from 1700–1912, Kolkata enjoyed the privilege of being the capital of British India and witnessed a spate of frenzied construction of buildings, largely influenced by the conscious intermingling of Neo-Gothic, Baroque, Neo-Classical, Oriental and Islamic schools of design. Unlike many north Indian cities, whose construction stresses minimalism, the layout of much of the architectural variety in Kolkata owes its origins to European styles and tastes imported by the British and to a much lesser extent, by the Portuguese and French. Currently Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan is the brand ambassador of West Bengal Tourism. The promotional films on West Bengal starring Shah Rukh Khan have been directed by Indian National Award winning filmmaker Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury. ==Architectural and geographical== The state of West Bengal has significant architectural and natural heritage. The capital of the state, Kolkata is also known as the \\"City of Palaces\\". It is also known as the \\"City of Joy\\" as coined by French author Dominique Lappierre through his synonymous book. West Bengal is famous for its terracotta temples of Bishnupur. Hazarduari Palace, a popular tourist attraction, is known to have the second largest chandelier in the world and also the largest staircase in India. This three-storey palace was built in 1837 by Duncan McLeod for Nawab Nazim Humaun Jah, the then Nawab of Bengal. The palace was built in the Indo-European style. It derives its name from the thousand doors in the palace (among which only 900 are real). In 1985, the palace was handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for better preservation. The Hazarduari Palace Museum is regarded as the biggest site museum of ASI and has 20 displayed galleries containing 4742 antiquities, 1034 of which are displayed for the public. They include various weapons, oil paintings of Dutch, French and Italian artists, marble statues, rare books, old maps, land revenue records and palanquins (mostly belonging to 18th and 19th centuries). Cooch Behar Palace built in 1887, was designed on the model of Buckingham Palace in London, during the reign of Maharaja Nripendra Narayan. The Victoria Memorial, Howrah Bridge (Rabindra Setu) and the Second Hooghly Bridge (Vidyasagar Setu) are iconic of Kolkata. Aside from colonial and heritage buildings, there are also high rising monuments and skyscrapers in the city. There are also a couple of cemeteries established by the British when Kolkata was the capital of British India. These include the South Park Street Cemetery and Scottish Cemetery.The South Park Street Cemetery, Calcutta, published by the Association for the Preservation of Historical Cemeteries in India, 5th ed. (2009)Morgan House is a classic example of colonial architecture in Kalimpong225x225px The River Ganga flows through the state. World heritage sites in West Bengal include the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway and the Sundarbans National Park. Neora Valley National Park, which is one of the richest biological zones in the entire Northeast, situated in the Kalimpong subdivision under Darjeeling District, is in West Bengal. The Ganges Delta (also known as the Ganges–Brahmaputra Delta, the Sunderbans Delta, or the Bengalla Delta) is in the South Asia region of Bengal, consisting of West Bengal and its neighbouring country of Bangladesh. It is the world's largest delta, and empties into the Bay of Bengal. It is one of the most fertile regions in the world, thus earning the nickname \\"The Green Delta\\". It stretches from the Hooghly River on the west to the Meghna River on the east. It is approximately across at the Bay of Bengal. Kolkata and Haldia are the principal Indian seaports on the delta. The Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden or Calcutta Botanical Garden (previously known as Indian Botanic Garden)\\"Indian Botanic Garden, Howrah.\\" BSI. Web. 28 February 2011. <> is the largest and oldest reserve of greeneries of its kind in South East Asia. It is also a premier institution for botanical and horticultural research in India. The garden is situated on the west bank of the River Hooghly in Shibpur, Howrah, nearly 8 km from center of city Kolkata. Located here is the Great Banyan Tree. It was the widest tree in the world in terms of the area of its canopy and is estimated to be about 200 to 250 years old. It became diseased after it was struck by lightning, so in 1925 the middle of the tree was excised to keep the remainder healthy. West Bengal also has some more geographical indications like Nakshi Kantha (handicraft), Darjeeling tea (agricultural), Santipore saree (handicraft), Shantiniketan leather goods (handicraft), Fazli mango (agricultural), Khirsapati or Himsagar mango (agricultural), Laxman Bhog mango (agricultural), Baluchari saree (handicraft) and Dhaniakhali saree (handicraft). ==Sea beaches== Mandarmani Sea Beach West Bengal stretches to the Bay of Bengal in the south. The coastal strip of West Bengal, extending from the Gangetic Delta to the border of Orissa, has some beautiful coastal settlements, such as Digha, Shankarpur, Mandarmani, Bakkhali, Gangasagar and Tajpur. Some of these have beaches which are hard enough for cars to drive on. ==Hill stations== There are many hill stations in North West Bengal, of which Darjeeling is world-famous. Others are Kurseong, Kalimpong, Rimbick, Lava and Loleygaon, Mirik and Sandakfu. Bagmundi is also famous among tourist, it's situated southern Part of West Bengal ==Wildlife sanctuaries and national parks== Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary. West Bengal has 3.26% of its geographical area under protected areas comprising 15 wildlife sanctuaries and 5 national parks — Sundarbans National Park, Buxa Tiger Reserve, Gorumara National Park, Neora Valley National Park, Singalila National Park, and Jaldapara National Park. West Bengal also has wildlife sanctuaries and bird sanctuaries like Chintamani Kar Bird Sanctuary and Raiganj Wildlife Sanctuary. ==Flora and fauna== As of 2009, recorded forest area in the state is which is 13.38% of the state's geographical area, compared to the national average of 21.02%. Part of the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, is located in southern West Bengal. The southern part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions: the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans. The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation. A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous sundari (Heritiera fomes), from which the forest gets its name. The distribution of vegetation in northern West Bengal is dictated by elevation and precipitation. For example, the foothills of the Himalayas, the Dooars, are densely wooded with Sal and other tropical evergreen trees. However, above an elevation of , the forest becomes predominantly subtropical. In Darjeeling, which is above , temperate-forest trees such as oaks, conifers, and rhododendrons predominate. Gorumara National Park Panorama from Jatraprosad watch tower Wildlife include Indian rhinoceros, Indian elephant, deer, bison, leopard, gaur, tiger and crocodiles, as well as many bird species. Migratory birds come to the state during the winter. The high-altitude forests of Singalila National Park shelter barking deer, red panda, chinkara, takin, serow, pangolin, minivet and Kalij pheasants. The Sundarbans are noted for a reserve project conserving the endangered Bengal tiger, although the forest hosts many other endangered species, such as the Gangetic dolphin, river terrapin and estuarine crocodile. The mangrove forest also acts as a natural fish nursery, supporting coastal fishes along the Bay of Bengal. Recognizing its special conservation value, Sundarban area has been declared as a Biosphere Reserve. ==Culture== The culture of West Bengal attracts tourists from around the world. It has its roots in literature, music, fine arts, drama and cinema. The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region shows a different cultural aspect. Rabindranath Tagore is Asia's first Nobel laureate and composer of India's national anthem. Swami Vivekananda was a key figure in introducing Vedanta and Yoga in Europe and the USA. They all belong from West Bengal, and their houses and residencies like Shantiniketan and Jorasanko Thakur Bari are world-famous and attract many tourists. West Bengal also has a long tradition of popular literature, music and drama largely based on Bengali folklore and Hindu epics and Puranas. Baul singers at Basanta- Utsab, Shantiniketan The Baul tradition is a unique heritage of Bengali folk music, which has also been influenced by regional music traditions. Other folk music forms include Gombhira and Bhawaiya. Folk music in West Bengal is often accompanied by the ektara, a one-stringed instrument. West Bengal also has a heritage in North Indian classical music. \\"Rabindrasangeet\\", songs composed and set into tune by Rabindranath Tagore, and \\"Nazrul geeti\\" (by Kazi Nazrul Islam) are popular. Also prominent are other musical forms like Dwijendralal, Atulprasad and Rajanikanta's songs and \\"adhunik\\" or modern music from films and other composers. However, since the early 1990s, there has been an emergence and popularisation of new genres of music, including fusions of Baul and jazz by several Bangla bands, as well as the emergence of Jeebonmukhi Gaan (a modern genre based on realism). Bengali dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance traditions. Chau dance of Purulia is a rare form of mask dance. West Bengal is known for Bengali folk music such as baul and kirtans and gajan, and modern songs including Bengali \\"adhunik\\" (modern) songs. A jatra actor prepares before the performance, Sunderbans The state is home to a thriving cinema industry, dubbed \\"Tollywood\\". Tollygunje in Kolkata is the location of numerous Bengali movie studios, and the name \\"Tollywood\\" (similar to Hollywood and Bollywood) is derived from that name. The Bengali film industry is well known for its art films, and has produced acclaimed directors like Satyajit Ray and actors like Uttam Kumar and singers like Arijit Singh. Among other types of theatre, West Bengal has a tradition of folk drama known as jatra. West Bengal has been the harbinger of modernism in fine arts. Kolkata was also the workplace of several social reformers, like Raja Ram Mohan Ray, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar and Swami Vivekananda. These social reforms have eventually led to a cultural atmosphere where practices like sati, dowry and caste-based discrimination or untouchability, the evils that crept into the Hindu society, were abolished. Kumortuli is a famous tourist attraction in Kolkata. It is traditionally a potters' quarter in North Kolkata. By virtue of their artistic productions these potters have moved from obscurity to prominence. This Kolkata neighbourhood not only supplies clay idols of Hindu gods and goddesses to barowari pujas in Kolkata and its neighbourhoods, but also exports a number of idols. It is one of the seven wonders in Kolkata. Bengal is also well known for its variety of handwoven Sarees. It is home to exquisite sarees such as Jamdani Sarees, Baluchari Sarees, Kantha stitch Sarees, Tussar Silk Sarees, Muslin Sarees and Matka Sarees. These variety of handwoven sarees in a single place is a rarity in today's modern times. == Cuisine == Rice and fish are traditional favourite foods, leading to a saying in Bengali, machhe bhate bangali (Bengali language:মাছে ভাতে বাঙালী) that translates as \\"fish and rice make a Bengali\\". Bengal's vast repertoire of fish-based dishes includes hilsa preparations, a favourite among Bengalis. There are numerous ways of cooking fish depending on the texture, size, fat content and bones. Sweets occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and at their social ceremonies. It is an ancient custom among both Hindu and Muslim Bengalis to distribute sweets during festivities. The confectionery industry has flourished because of its close association with social and religious ceremonies. Competition and changing tastes have helped to create many new sweets. Bengalis make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products, including rôshogolla, chômchôm, kalojam and several kinds of sondesh. Pitha, a kind of sweet cake, bread or dim sum are specialties of winter season. Sweets like coconut-naru, til-naru, moa, and payesh are prepared during the festival of Lakshmi puja. Popular street food includes aloor chop, beguni, kati roll and phuchka. ==Darjeeling Himalayan Hill Region== Colourful Buddhist prayer flags around Mahakal Temple at Observatory Hill, Darjeeling Apart from the major Hindu religious festivals like Diwali, Christmas, Dussera, Holi, Ram Navami, the diverse ethnic populace of Darjeeling Himalayan hill region celebrates several local festivals. The Tibetan ethnic groups like the Lepchas, Bhutias, Gurungs, and Tamangs celebrate new year called Losar in January/February, Maghe Sankranti, Chotrul Duchen, Buddha Jayanti and Tendong Lho Rumfaat, to name a few, which provide the \\"regional distinctness\\" of Darjeeling's local culture from the rest of West Bengal. A popular food in Darjeeling is the momo, a steamed dumpling containing either mutton, pork, beef or vegetables cooked in a doughy wrapping served with a watery vegetable soup and spicy tomato sauce/chutney. Wai-Wai is a favourite packaged snack of Darjeeling hills comprising noodles which are eaten either dry or with soup. Churpee, a kind of hard cheese made from cow or yak's milk, is another popular mini-snack that is both nutritious and a pastime. A form of noodle called thukpa, served with soup and vegetables, is extremely popular in and around the hills of Darjeeling. Chhang and tongba are local alcoholic beverages made from millet. ==Pilgrimages== West Bengal attracts tourists for pilgrimages to the holy places of different religions. ;Hinduism Goddess Bhavatarini from the Dakshineshwar Kali Temple People from different sections of the world come to West Bengal for holy pilgrimages as Kolkata is one of the four adi Shaktipeethas.

The Dynix Automated Library System was a popular integrated library system, with a heyday from the mid-1980s to the late-1990s. It was used by libraries to replace the paper- based card catalog, and track lending of materials from the library to patrons.Gordon Dunsire, Chris Pinder, (1991) \\"Dynix, automation and development at Napier Polytechnic\\", Program: electronic library and information systems, Vol. 25 Iss: 2, pp.91 - 103 First developed in 1983, it eventually became the most popular library automation software ever released, and was once near-ubiquitous in libraries boasting an electronic card catalog, peaking at over 5,000 installations worldwide in the late 1990s, with a market share of nearly 80%,Automation Systems Installed Counting by Library organizations. including the United States' Library of Congress. Typical of 1980s software technology, Dynix had a character-based user interface, involving no graphics except ASCII art/ANSI art boxes. ==History== The first installation, in 1983, was at a public library in Kershaw County, South Carolina. The library actually contracted for the system before the software was written. In the words of Paul Sybrowsky, founder of Dynix: \\"There was no software, no product. Undaunted, we pitched our plan to create an automated library system to a public library in South Carolina. We didn't have a product, but we said 'You need a system and we'd like to bid on it,' and showed them our business plan.\\"The Deseret News, 31 August 1993, page D8. The original Dynix library system was based on software developed at CTI (Computer Translation Incorporated) which was a development project of Brigham Young University, and presided over by Gary Carlson. The initial search engine tools: FSELECT and FSORT were written for the PICK operating system under contract for CTI by Walter Nicholes as part of a bid for a research support systems for AT&T; laboratories. Paul Sybrowsky was an employee of CTI. (As was Bruce Park, founder of ALII library systems, later GEAC Library Systems.) Both library systems (Dynix and ALII) were based on these PICK based search engine tools. Dynix use grew quickly in the early-and-mid 1990s. In October 1989, Dynix had just 292 installations. Fifteen months later, in January 1991, it was up 71% to 500 installations.http://www.librarytechnology.org/ltg- displaytext.pl?RC=4885 A year-and-a-half later, in June 1993, Dynix had doubled its installed base, signing its 1,000th contract.http://www.librarytechnology.org/ltg-displaytext.pl?RC=5274 At its peak in the late 1990s, Dynix had over 5,000 libraries using its system, amounting to an 80% market share. The customer base for Dynix did not begin decreasing until 2000,Automation System Marketplace 2004: Migration Down Innovation Up at which point it started being replaced by Internet-based interfaces (so-called \\"Web PACs\\"). In 2003, it was reported that Dynix was being phased out by its manufacturer, and approaching \\"end-of-life\\" status in terms of functionality and support.City of Mission Viejo - Agenda Report - October 6, 2003 By 2004, its market share was down to 62%, still a comfortable majority. Phase-outs were constant in the late 2000s, and by the second decade of the 21st century, it was obsolete and remained in very few libraries. By mid-2013, only 88 libraries were on record as having Dynix installed.http://www.librarytechnology.org/diglib- displayindex.pl?SID=20130626136871337&pagenumber;=1&code;=lwc& The majority of phase-outs took place between 2002 and 2007. At one point, Dynix was benchmarked supporting 1,600 terminals on a single system.http://www.librarytechnology.org/ltg-displaytext.pl?RC=7432 This stability would later come in handy; the largest installations ever were the King County Library System in the greater Seattle area, which was largest by collection size (tens of millions of cataloged items), and New York Public Library in New York City, which covered the largest geographical area with 87 branches (requiring dumb terminals numbering into the thousands). Several specialized versions were released, all nearly identical to the mainstream version. For academic libraries, primarily K-12, there was Dynix Scholar (an Intel 80xxx-based microcomputer version of regular Dynix). For very small libraries, with perhaps only one or two terminals, there was Dynix Elite. The original Dynix system, as used in regular public libraries, was renamed Dynix Classic later in its lifespan to distinguish it from other Dynix products.Lynn Corrigan, Gordon Dunsire, Gill Hamilton, Peigi MacKillop, (1993) \\"The Dynix PAC at Napier University of Edinburgh\\", VINE, Vol. 23 Iss: 1, pp.24 - 32 ==Technical details== Based around a relational database, Dynix was originally written in Pick/BASIC,http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/john-rose/16/736/b87 and run on the PICK operating system. In 1990, it was ported to VMark's uniVerse BASIC programming language, and run on Unix-based servers, with uniVerse acting as a PICK emulation layer between the software and the operating system. In the late 1990s, Dynix was once again re-ported, this time for Windows NT-based servers; again, uniVerse acted as a Pick emulator between the software and the operating system. Pick/BASIC and uniVerse BASIC are the same programming language, so porting Dynix did not require re-writing the source code. In the words of one Dynix developer, \\"[Dynix] was programmed in Pick/BASIC ... however, as it matured, it was written in uniVerse BASIC ... It was never re- written. That type of BASIC isn't easy to move to any other language. None other handles data as well. It's a very fast-compiled and -interpreted language, and frankly nothing matches it, then or now. It's too bad that it (uniVerse BASIC) was so good, because it didn't make the transition to object- oriented Web-based technology in time to stay afloat.\\" The software was originally written on computers made by The Ultimate Corp. of East Hanover, New Jersey, which ran Ultimate's proprietary implementation of the PICK operating system. Later, Dynix moved to IBM RISC/6000-based computers running AIX throughout the company, except in Training, which used SCO Unix. While most libraries purchased the same type of servers as Dynix was using, there were installations done on platforms such as DEC and MIPS, Sequent, Sequoia (which used a very expensive native PICK), HP's Unix servers, etc. The Dynix corp. could do software-only installs to any compliant Unix because of uniVerse's scalability and adaptability. Dynix was originally developed around the ADDS Viewpoint A2 terminal's escape sequences, because ADDS terminals were the de facto standard on the PICK-based mainframes on which Dynix was created. Shortly after Dynix started being deployed to libraries around the country, requests started coming back that alternate terminals be provided for patron use; children would bang on the keyboards or throw books at the terminals, or use unauthorized key sequences to mess up the programming. In response, Dynix asked Wyse to develop such a terminal; Wyse created the WY-30, which was a stripped-down version of the best-selling terminal ever made, the WY-60. The swivel base was removed so that the terminal sat flat on whatever surface it was placed on; what the unit now lacked in viewing-angle adjustability, it made up for in physical stability (it could not be knocked over by the force of a child). A specially-designed keyboard reduced the number of keys from 101 to 83, mainly by removing all the function keys; this was designed to keep users out of the internal setup functions and other parts of the software they \\"weren't supposed to be going\\". To maintain compatibility with how Dynix was already written, the WY-30 supported the Adds Viewpoint A2 emulation, which was actually one of the only emulations on the terminal. They WY-30 had very few emulations compared to most Wyse products, and notably did not support VT100 or any other ANSI emulations. Years later, when the Dynix company was moving from Ultimate computers running Pick/OS to IBM computers running AIX and uniVerse, compatibility for VT100/102/340 terminals was added to the software; then, other models of Wyse terminal started coming into favor, such as the WY-60 and WY-150, which were easier on the eyes and hands than the WY-30 was. The complete Dynix Classic approached 900,000 lines of source code, and compiled at around 120 MB. It was distributed via tape drive, first on 1/2\\" reel-to-reel tape, then later 1/4\\" cartridge tapes for Dynix Elite users, and 8mm cartridges for everyone else. One reason for Dynix's success was that an entire library consortium could be run off of just one server, in one location, with one copy of the software. This meant that a library system with multiple branches—whether a large single-city system such as the one in New York City, or whether a consortium made of several small cities/towns banded together—could pool their funds and only have to purchase one server and one copy of the software. Each branch had their own Circulation module, but the actual catalog database was a single copy on one server in a central location. Each record had a line in it stating which actual branch the item belonged to, allowing users to request holds/transfers from another branch to their branch, as well as see whether it was checked in or out at its home branch. This saved a significant sum of money - millions of dollars, in the case of the largest installations - versus Dynix's competitors, who required a separate server and copy of the software in each library branch. With the single copy of the Dynix software installed on a central server, both patrons and librarians could access it by using dumb terminals. The technology for linking the terminals to the server within each building, and linking the separate buildings (branches) together to the central server location, changed over time as technology progressed. The earliest method was to have the entire system connected via RS-232; there would be many muxes (statistical multiplexers) and many miles of serial lines. Muxes were the phone company's solution for connecting serial lines between branches. Later, dumb terminals were connected via RS-232 to a terminal server, which in turn connected via Ethernet to the branch's LAN. The separate branches would be connected to the central Dynix server via IP-based methods (the Internet). The latest installations used PC's running terminal emulation software, and connecting to the Dynix server via telnet over the Internet. Dynix was made up of several different modules, each of which was purchased independently to create a scaled system based on the library's size and needs. A library could buy as few as two modules. The two basic modules were Cataloging ($15,000 + $1,500 annual maintenance), and Circulation ($12,000 + $1,200 annual maintenance). Some of the other modules included Kids' Catalog, Bookmobile, Homebound, Media Scheduling, Reserve Bookroom, TeleCirc, DebtCollect, Electronic Notification System, and Self Check-Out. A Dialcat/DialPac module was offered, allowing patrons with a modem and terminal emulation software to dial in from home and search the card catalog or renew books. Programs with a text-based interface, such as Dynix, are described as being either \\"menu-driven\\" or \\"command-line-driven\\", referring to how users interact with the software. Dynix was actually a hybrid of both; the patrons used a menu-driven interface, where they would be given a numbered list of options, and simply have to key in the number of the option they wanted in order to navigate through the system. Unknown to the patrons, the librarians had the ability to manipulate the system in the command-line-driven way, by keying in special codes at the same prompts where patrons would key in menu item numbers. These codes, referred to a \\"dot commands\\" due to their structure of being a period followed by one or two letters (such as '.c' to switch between checkout and checkin screens in to the Circulation module), allowed librarians access to advanced/hidden features of the Dynix system, and - along with password-protection - prevented patrons from gaining unauthorized levels of access.http://www.hclib.org/extranet/circulation/HOP/dotcommand.htmlhttp://www.angelfire.com/nc/plcmc/page3.html ==Company history== The company selling the Dynix software changed hands several times over the years: first it was called Dynix Systems, Inc. Then it was Ameritech Library Services, followed by epixtech, then simply Dynix, then Sirsi Corporation, and most recently SirsiDynix.History of Library Automation [Library Technology Guides] ==Gallery== File:Dynix ILS on Wyse WY-60 dumb terminal - closeup.jpgA Wyse WY-60 dumb terminal displaying the dial-pac of the Dynix system at Goshen Public Library in Goshen, Indiana, via Telnet on May 2, 2013.

Their opponent was BSK Belgrade, who was dominating Yugoslav football in that period and was running for their third consecutive title. BSK won both matches 3–1 and later ended up being champions after beating Slavija Sarajevo in the final.Yugoslavia – List of Final Tables at RSSSF During the next season, 1936–37, SK Ljubljana again played among the best Yugoslav clubs, however this time the league was played in a two-round robin system which was always used since then, and the result was an eighth place out of ten clubs. Their third consecutive participation in the Yugoslav elite was even worse; Ljubljana finished in ninth place out of ten clubs. The 1938–39 season saw an expansion to twelve clubs and SK Ljubljana, playing their fourth consecutive season in the league, finished in ninth place, in front of relatively inexperienced clubs such as Građanski Skopje, Sparta Zemun and Slavija Varaždin. The 1939–40 season saw a change in the league format. Two leagues were formed, the Serbian League and the Croato-Slovenian League. The Yugoslav champion was to be decided in a final tournament which was a league formed by the best three clubs of each of the leagues. SK Ljubljana played in the Croato-Slovenian League, however failed to qualify to the final tournament. The 1940–41 season was intended to be played in a similar system, only that the Croato-Slovenian League was separated into a Croatian and Slovenian divisions. SK Ljubljana won the 1940–41 Slovenian League, thus qualifying to the final tournament to decide the Yugoslav champion, however due to the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and the subsequent entry of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia into the World War II, the final tournament was not played. ==Honours== *Ljubljana Subassociation League: 2 ::1935–36, 1940–41 ==References== Category:Association football clubs established in 1936 Category:Football clubs in Yugoslavia Category:1936 establishments in Slovenia Category:Defunct football clubs in Slovenia Category:Football clubs in Ljubljana Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1941 ","title":"SK Ljubljana"},{"id":"35952169","text":"The 2012–13 Northern Football League season (known as the 2012–13 Ebac Northern League for sponsorship reasons) is the 115th in the history of the Northern Football League, a football competition in England.

T. C. Rolt. Originally published in 1944 by Eyre & Spottiswoode, it has continuously been in print since. It describes a four-month trip that Rolt took with his bride Angela at the outbreak of the Second World War. The book is credited with a revival of interest in the English canals, leading directly to the creation of the Inland Waterways Association, which spearheaded the restoration and leisure use of the canals. ==Synopsis== Part One is a general introduction to the English Canal system. He points out at the outset that \\"most people today know no more of the canals than they do of the old green roads which the pack-horse trains once travelled.\\" If this is no longer true, it is largely thanks to this book. It has an account of converting the wooden narrowboat Cressy for liveaboard use at Tooley's Boatyard in Banbury. He paid particular attention to the traditional narrowboat decorations of Roses and Castles and the installation of a short bath, unusual even now on narrowboats. In Part Two 'on an afternoon of the last week in July' [1939] Tom and Angela set out up the Oxford Canal and into a different world of contours and canal pubs where boat captains with gold rings in their ears play games apart from their wives. They follow the Grand Union Canal to Market Harborough (alas no market) and north through Leicester to the Trent and Shardlow, where the scene in the Canal Tavern 'would have delighted Hogarth or Rabelais'. They make their way up the still busy Trent and Mersey Canal through the Potteries before emerging into the rural landscape of Church Minshull where they stay and enjoy the unspoilt English countryside. Part Three starts with Rolt converting his petrol engine to run on paraffin, because of the shortage of petrol caused by the war. They start the journey south, encountering the horse fair at Market Drayton, a proper market town. Having reached Autherley Junction they turned back on the Coventry Canal to use the whole length of the Oxford Canal, avoiding the lockage and industrial scenes of Birmingham. The voyage ends as they near Oxford. ==Publication and reception== Rolt, who had worked with engines all his life until then, settled down to write the account of his voyage as he worked at a foundry near Hungerford. His manuscript was rejected by all the London publishers and an agent to whom he offered it. It wasn't until 1943 that his friendship with H. J. Massingham gave him the introduction he needed to get it published, in 1944. The book arrived at the right time to a nation growing weary of war. It was well-reviewed, and it was not long before the first printing sold out, although with the shortage of paper at the end of the war a new printing had to wait for some months. Sir Compton Mackenzie described it as \\"an elegy of classic restraint unmarred by any trace of sentiment. His pen is as sure as the brush of a Cotman. Narrow Boat will go on the shelf with White and Cobbett and Hudson\\". Rolt started to receive fan mail on his boat at Tardebigge.

The estate had been purchased in 1722 by his grandfather George Parker (d.1743) of Boringdon and North Molton, both in Devon, as the following summary of a deed dated 14 March 1722 relates:Plymouth and West Devon Record Office, Morley of Saltram 69/M/2/331 > \\"Agreement 1) George Bennett and Henry Bennett, his son and heir apparent, > both of Whiteway 2) George Parker of Boringdon, esquire. Conveyance of the > estate of inheritance in fee simple of the tenements called Whiteway, > Wolcombe and Oxencombe\\" He had also purchased Saltram before in 1712 and at another time Polsloe Priory. Whiteway became the residence of Lord Boringdon's younger brother Montagu Edmund Parker (1737–1831), of Blagdon in the parish of Paignton, who was Sheriff of Devon in 1789 and whose two portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds and John Downman survive at Saltram House. See images It became the residence of his grandson Montagu Edmund Newcombe Parker (1807–1858), Conservative MP for South Devon (1835–41) and Sheriff of Devon in 1849, whose tomb can be seen in Chudleigh churchyard. [Lord Boringdon's grandson Edmund Parker, 2nd Earl of Morley (1810–1864) married in 1842 Harriet Parker (1809–1897), his second cousin and sister and heiress of Montagu E.N. Parker, and Whiteway thus returned into the possession of the senior line of the family when it became in 1897 the inheritance of Hariett's son Albert Edmund Parker, 3rd Earl of Morley (1843–1905). The 3rd Earl had inherited debts of £200,000 from his father who had been forced by his poor financial situation to let Saltram to tenants from 1861, three years before his death, which tenancies continued for 23 years until 1884. During this exile from Saltram the Earls lived partly abroad, in rented London houses and at Whiteway with the Dowager Countess Hariett. The 2nd Earl died at Whiteway on 23 August 1864.History of Chudleigh, Chap. 8 The 3rd Earl married well to a wealthy heiress, Margaret Holford, daughter and eventual heiress of the very wealthy Robert Stayner Holford of Westonbirt House in Gloucestershire, and finances recovered temporarily until the agricultural slump of the start of the 20th century forced the 4th Earl to let Whiteway in 1911,Johnson, p.56 the proceeds from which he used to make improvements at Saltram. However the family's finances did not recover and he sold Whiteway in 1923.Johnson, p.57 The Parker family of Whiteway acquired the manor of Collaton St Mary, near Paignton, the public house of which is still called (in 2012) the \\"Parker Arms\\".http://www.collatonstmary.org.uk ===Farquhar=== It appears that the house had been let to Ernest Farquhar (1853–1930), grandson of Sir Thomas Harvie Farquhar, 2nd Baronet of Cadogan House. He married Maria Theresa Lister, daughter of Sir Thomas Villiers Lister and had two sons, the younger of whom was Lt. Rupert Farquhar MC of the 4th Battalion Grenadier Guards, killed in action on 17 September 1917 in Belgium aged 20. His tombstone in the Canada Farm Cemetery in Belgium records his parents as of Whiteway in Chudleigh as does his entry on the Chudleigh War Memorial. His eldest son was Sir Harold Lister Farquhar (1894–1953), MC, CMG, Ambassador. The occupant in the 1960s was Alfred Farquhar, who had a notable collection of fine art. The Chudleigh History Group relates the recent history differently: \\"The Parkers remained until 1896 at which time through marriage (seemingly erroneous, no such marriage is discoverable) it passed to the Farquhar family. In the Farquhars time the estate comprised over 1000 acres and 800 acres of woodland on Haldon Moor, the Farquhars remained up until 1967\\" ===Legge=== Whiteway was offered for sale in 1973.Listed Buildings text In 2000 Whiteway was purchased with 281 acres by Raine Spencer, Countess Spencer (1929-2016), who had married as her first husband Gerald Legge, 9th Earl of Dartmouth (d. 1997), from whom she was divorced in 1976.

Born in North Wales, he grew up in Merseyside before attending Cambridge University. Following graduation, he served with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, including several cruises on board . After demobilisation he served part-time with the naval reserves reaching the rank of lieutenant commander. In civilian life Roberts was employed by water engineering consultant John Taylor & Sons and remained with them and their successor bodies for the rest of his career. He became founder chairman of the successor Acer Consultants in 1987, holding the post for five years, during which the group's turnover quadrupled and employee numbers trebled. Roberts worked extensively in the Middle East, largely upon wastewater and water-treatment schemes. He worked with many engineering organisations and became president of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1986. Roberts has written a number of academic papers on diverse subjects and has received awards for many of them. In retirement he was active in a number of engineering and other organisations. == Early life and military service == Roberts was born in Harlech, Wales in July 1925. His parents, who were both fluent in Welsh, moved to Merseyside where Roberts attended Merchant Taylors' School, Crosby. Having been awarded a State Bursary in 1943 Roberts studied engineering at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where he remained until 1945. Roberts then entered the engineering branch of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), the reserve officer force of the Royal Navy, and undertook his initial training at Devonport. He served on the cruiser whilst she was flagship of the America and West Indies Station, and made several cruises aboard her showing the flag in South America and the Caribbean, during which time he was transferred to the main Royal Navy with the rank of temporary sub-lieutenant(E). He returned to the RNVR on 7 December 1948 with his rank confirmed as permanent, and seniority backdated to 24 July, and was promoted to lieutenant on 17 August of the next year with seniority again backdated to 24 July. He was subsequently promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander on 25 September 1957 (with seniority again of 24 July) and retired in that rank on 23 April 1963, by which time the RNVR had become the Royal Naval Reserve. == Engineering career == On leaving HMS Sheffield Roberts entered civilian employment as an Assistant Resident Engineer with John Taylor & Sons, an engineering consultancy which specialised in water and wastewater engineering. His first assignment was to a drainage project in Bootle, where he received a wage of £5 per week, before moving to the firm's London offices in 1949. Roberts was sent to Kuwait in 1952 to design that country's first water-distribution system, an assignment that began a life long association with the Middle East. He was appointed a partner in the firm in 1956 and subsequently designed water-supply projects in Bahrain, Oman and Saudi Arabia, and sewerage projects in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Iraq – including Baghdad's first sewage-treatment scheme. During this time Roberts also worked in the UK, at John Taylor & Sons' Liverpool and Plymouth offices, working on various water and wastewater projects including the design of marine outfall sewer pipes. In 1968 Roberts was elected president of the Institution of Public Health Engineers and in 1974 represented the institution on the code- drafting sub-committee of the British Standards for foundations of machinery. Continuing his work with sewerage design at John Taylor & Sons he was part of the Anglo-American team that was awarded the Cairo Wastewater Project in 1978, one of the largest public-health engineering projects ever constructed. Roberts became John Taylor's senior partner in 1984 and was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers for the 1986–87 session. He was also a member of the Natural Environment Research Council from August 1987 to July 1993 and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1987. Roberts became co-chairman, and later chairman, of Acer Consultants, which was formed in 1987 following the merger of John Taylor & Sons with Freeman Fox & Partners. He retired as chairman in 1992, by which time he had overseen a quadrupling of the group's turnover and a trebling of staff numbers. He was president of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers in 2009, having been elected to membership of the society in 1987. During his career Roberts also served as chairman of the British Geological Survey, of the Football Stadia Advisory Design Council, the Second Severn Crossing Technical Adjudication Panel and as Visiting Professor at Loughborough University. He was also the Royal Academy of Engineering's honorary secretary for civil engineering and a Fellow of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, an Honorary Fellow of the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management and was named one of Britain's four major international engineers of the 20th century by The Sunday Times Magazine. He was also a frequent academic author with over 19 articles in recognised journals, sometimes in collaboration with co-authors. These covered topics including marine engineering, sewage treatment, highways and engineering history, and were recognised by the award of the Institution of Civil Engineers' Stephenson Medal & Halcrow Premium, and the Institution of Public Health Engineers' gold and silver medals. On 21 July 2015, at the age of 89, he delivered the Smeaton Lecture at the Institution of Civil Engineers. == Personal life == Roberts married Rosemary Giles in 1960 and they had two children together. Rosemary died in 1973 and Roberts subsequently married Wendy Moore in 1978. He remained involved with his alma mater, becoming president of the Merchant Taylors' School Old Boys' Association in 1998 and an honorary fellow of Sidney Sussex College in 1994. He has made charitable donations to both bodies.. He has also donated to the Royal Academy of Engineering Development Appeal. Roberts was a director of the Newcomen Society for the Study of History of Engineering and Technology, and was a Liveryman of the Worshipful Companies of Constructors, Engineers and Water Conservators and was chairman of his parish council. He lived in Newick in East Sussex. He died on 31 July 2020 at the age of 95.Roberts == Publications == In retirement he continued with the writing of articles and books, most of which were on non- technical aspects of engineering topics.

He served as an office with the police force from Shiga Prefecture. In 1880, he was transferred to Tokyo, where he caught the attention of Itō Hirobumi and was recruited into the Home Ministry. However, in 1889, Kataoka was recruited away from a career to accept the post of vice president of Nippon Life Insurance Company, and subsequently served as president of the company from 1903–1919. He was also president of the Miyako Hotels chain from 1915, and served as a member of the board for the Kyōdō Bank and Kansai Railways. Kataoka returned to political life as a member of the Lower House of the Diet of Japan in the 1892 General Election, and was subsequently re-elected eight times. A political ally of Katsura Tarō, he joined Katsura’s Rikken Dōshikai political party in 1913 and subsequently served as a senior official in the Kenseikai. As a politician, he was sympathetic to labor relations issues, advocating a government-run worker’s insurance plan and an easing of police restrictions on labor protests. Kataoka joined the cabinet during the 2nd administration of Prime Minister Katō Takaaki as Minister of Commerce and Industry in 1924. He later served as Minister of Finance under the 1st cabinet of Wakatsuki Reijirō in 1927. However, his public proclamation during budgetary deliberations on March 14, 1927 that the Tokyo Watanabe Bank had gone bankrupt, when in fact it had not, resulted a bank run and was one of the main factors behind the Shōwa financial crisis and the collapse of the Wakatsuki administration. Kataoka was awarded with a seat in the House of Peers from 1930.

A lawyer by training, Benjamin represented Ivor Bird, the brother of Prime Minister Lester Bird, following his arrest for the attempted smuggling of cocaine. He was then returned as the Member of Parliament for St John's City South, representing Bird's Labour Party, and was re-elected during the 1999 general election with 845 votes, defeating the United Progressive Party candidate Vaughn Walter. He was then sworn in, on 12 March, as Minister of Planning, Implementation and Public Service Affairs. Later that year he was transferred, becoming Minister of Labour, Home Affairs and Co-operatives. In 2001 his position was expanded with the stripping of internal security power from Errol Cort, the Attorney General of Antigua and Barbuda, and the granting of this portfolio to Benjamin. As Minister for Labour, Benjamin was responsible for introducing the Sir George Walter (Pension and Other Benefits) Act 2002, which sought to grant Sir George Walter, the second Premier of Antigua and Barbuda, and father of the aforementioned Vaughn Walter, a pension of 10,000 East Caribbean dollars a month, and announced that non-Antiguans who lived in Antigua for three years or more would not be required to obtain permits to work.

A doll maker in China crafts a puppet which he is convinced is lifelike. He takes it to exhibit at a public event, but is outraged to find an even more convincing and beautiful doll there. It is in fact a real woman pretending to be a doll, but he becomes so obsessed he attempts to steal her and the film ends with her rescue and his tragic death. The film had its premiere in Berlin in November 1923.

Between 1919 and 1928, seven congresses were held in Jerusalem, Jaffa, Haifa and Nablus. Despite broad public support their executive committees were never officially recognised by the British, who said they were unrepresentative.Khalidi, Rashid (2006) The Iron Cage.

It was presided over by Aref al-Dajani, president of the Jerusalem Muslim-Christian Society. Also present were Izzat Darwaza and Yusef al-'Isa, editor of Falastin. Most delegates were from the propertied class, and were evenly divided into pro- British and pan-Arab factions. A cable was sent to the Paris Peace Conference, demanding a renunciation of the Balfour Declaration and the inclusion of Palestine as \\"an integral part of...the independent Arab Government of Syria within an Arab Union, free of any foreign influence or protection\\". The Congress rejected political Zionism, agreeing to accept British assistance if it did not impinge on Arab sovereignty in the region. Palestine was envisaged as part of an independent Syrian state, governed by Faisal of the Hashemite family.Palestine Factionalism in the National Movement (1919-1939) The resolutions of the Jerusalem Congress were as follows: * \\"We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds.\\" * Rejection of French claims to the area * \\"Our district Southern Syria or Palestine should be not separated from the Independent Arab Syrian Government and be free from all foreign influence and protection\\" * All foreign treaties referring to the area are deemed void * To maintain friendly relations with Britain and the Allied powers, accepting help if it did not affect the country's independence and Arab unity It was decided to send a delegation to Damascus and representatives attended the Syrian National Congress in Damascus on 8 June 1919A Survey of Palestine - prepared in December 1945 and January 1946 for the information of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry.

Some of the would-be delegates sent a letter to the Syrian National Congress, stating their position and asking that they form a Palestinian delegation from Palestinian representatives present in Damascus that would travel directly to Europe to defend the Palestinian case. Shemesh says that there are a number of versions as to its timing and actual occurrence but quotes the memoirs of Izzat Darwaza with a version similar to the preceding. According to the Survey of Palestine, the delegates met earlier in Damascus on 27 February 1920.Survey. p.946 Allawai, Faisal's biographer, confims this date and that while the delegates were assembling in Damascus for the recalled Syrian National Congress, a large number of Palestinians had already gathered in Damascus and organised themselves into the ‘Palestinian Congress’. They posited an independent Palestine within a united Syrian state, denounced Zionism, and demanded an end to Jewish immigration. On 31 May, Palestinian emigres met at the Arab Club in Damascus and resolved to form 'The Palestinian Arab Society'. The officers of the Society were Haj Amin al-Husseini, Izzat Darwaza and ‘Aref al-‘Aref. The Society protested against the San Remo Conference's decision to grant Britain a mandate over Palestine and against Samuel's appointment. It also appealed to the Muslims of India and to the Pope, drawing attention to the Jewish danger in Palestine.(Ilan Pappe says that the second congress was held in secret in Palestine on 31 May 1920, because British military authorities had banned all Arab political gatherings and that a statement was issued calling for the return of all political deportees, and protesting the San Remo Conference decision to include the words of the Balfour Declaration in the text of the British mandate over Palestine. It is unclear if this is the same event as names given by Pappe are given by other sources as being in Damascus not PalestinePappe, Ilan (2002) The Rise and Fall of a Palestinian Dynasty. The Husaynis 1700-1948. AL Saqi edition 2010. . pp.202,203) ==Third congress: Haifa, 1920== Third Congress The third congress opened on 4 December. It was attended by 36 delegates, including Pasha Aref Dajani the Mayor of Jerusalem 1918 (seated fifth from the left next to Pasha Musa Kazem Husseini),Dajani Family Forum Sheik Suleiman al- Taji Al-Faruqi and head of the Catholic community Bullus Shehadeh. The congress was opened by Haifa's mufti, Muhammad Murad. Recently deposed mayor of Jerusalem Musa al-Husayni was elected president and chairman of the nine- member executive committee, a post he held until his death in 1934. It resolved as follows: *Called for Palestine to be part of the independent Arab state promised in the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence. Calls for unity with Syria were dropped, since the area was now under French control; however, unity between Palestine and Syria re-emerging at a later date was not ruled out.Bernard Regan, \\"The Implementation of the Balfour Declaration and the British Mandate in Palestine: problems of conquest and colonisation at the nadir of British Imperialism (1917–1936)\\", January 2016. *Condemned the notion of a homeland for the Jewish people. *Called on the British to establish \\"a national government responsible to representative assumbly, whose members would be chosen from the Arabic-speaking people who inhabited Palestine until the outbreak of the War\\" (but without explicitly rejecting British presence in Palestine). The model was based on the terms of the Mandate of Iraq, with a parliament elected by a one-citizen-one-vote system, which accepted overall British control.Pappe p.208. *Objected to the recognition of the World Zionist Organisation as an official body and the use of Hebrew as an official language. *Opposed Jewish immigration. *Declared the British administration illegal, since the League of Nations had not yet reached a decision about the status of the territory. Some delegates, such as Daoud Isa, complained that the congress was not sufficiently radical. After the congress the executive committee met British High Commissioner Herbert Samuel, who insisted that they accept British policy on the Jewish national homeland to receive official recognition. The British position that the congress was not representative led to a broad campaign by the Muslim-Christian Associations to raise public awareness.Khalidi, Rashid, p.42Kayyali, p.88. In March 1921 Musa Kazem led a delegation from the executive committee to meet the British Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill, who had called a conference in Cairo to decide British policy in the Middle East. Churchill agreed to meet the delegation, but refused to discuss any issues until after the conference. On his journey back to London he met with members of the executive committee in Jerusalem on 28 March 1921, telling them they had to accept the Balfour Declaration as an immutable part of British policy.Kayyali, p.93. ==Fourth congress: Jerusalem, 1921== Fourth congress The fourth congress, on 25 June 1921, was attended by about 100 delegates who voted to send a six-man delegation (led by Musa Kazim) to London. The delegates arrived in London in September and met with the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Winston Churchill. On their way, they met Pope Benedict XV in Vatican City and attempted to meet with delegates to the League of Nations in Geneva. Responding to the congress, High Commissioner Herbert Samuel promised that the British would \\"never impose a policy contrary to their religions, their political and their economic interests\\".Pappe, p.220Kayyali, p.99.Survey. p.946 ==Fifth congress: Nablus, 1922== Fifth congress The fifth congress opened on 22 August 1922, after the return of the London delegation. Its leader, Musa Kazem, opposed anti-British agitation and discouraged the use of violence; he reported that possibilities still existed for progress through negotiations. The following resolutions were passed: *Rejecting the new constitution. *Boycotting elections for the proposed Legislative Council. *Establishing a London bureau. *Boycotting Jewish goods, including Pinhas Rutenberg's planned electricity supply. *Forbidding land sales to Jews. *Forbidding Jewish immigration. *Pledging to oppose the establishment of a Jewish national homeland. Kayyali, pp.113,114.Khalidi, Walid p.89 Before the congress, its executive committee launched a fundraising campaign supporting a general strike held on 13–14 July 1922. Funds were raised from sales of National Movement stamps selling for one, two and five millims. The stamps depicted the Dome of the Rock, with \\"Palestine for the Arabs\\" in English and Arabic.Kayyali, p.107. ==Sixth congress: Jaffa, 1923== Sixth congress Held from 16–20 June 1923, the congress was chaired by Musa Kazim. It was agreed to send another delegation to London, eschewing the more- radical policies which were advocated. A proposed campaign of non-payment of taxes, arguing no taxation without representation, was debated without a decision. Twenty-four resolutions were passed, including boycotts of Pinhas Rutenberg's Palestine Electricity Corporation and Jewish goods.Kayyali, p.119. In October, the more-radical National Party was formed in opposition to the Muslim-Christian Associations and the executive committee.Kayyali, p.130. ==Seventh congress: Jerusalem, 1928== Held on 20 June 1928, the congress formed a short-lived united front with Musa Kazim as president.Pappe, p.232 A 48-member executive committee was elected, which selected an administrative staff consisting of a president, three secretaries and two other members. It was decided to send another delegation, the fourth, to London. It set out on 21 March 1930, after the publication of the Shaw Commission report on the 1929 riots. ==General Islamic Congress: Jerusalem, 1931== In General Islamic Congress in Jerusalem were not only Arabs. The World Islamic Congress was convened in Jerusalem in accordance with the charter of the organization of the World Islamic Congress in Mecca in 1926. More about the World Islamic Congress in Mecca (1926) see article World Islamic Congress and the note to the current article.Romanenko, V. S. (Vladislav Stanislavovich). Sotrudnichestvo sovetskoĭ diplomatii i musulmanskogo dukhovenstva SSSR v 20-e gody XX veka : nauchno-istoricheskiĭ ocherk 2005  Nizhniĭ Novgorod : [NIM \\"Makhnur\\"], this monograph is in the library of the British Museum, Oxford University, Harvard University, the University of Chicago, and it published the documents of the World Islamic Congress in Mecca (1926); Romanenko, V.S. (Vladislav Stanislavovich). Evoliutsiya poliki SSSR na Blighnem i Srednem Vostoke v period NEP. Germani, Saarbruecken, Lambert Academic Publishing, 2011. . As the influence of the Palestine Congress and its executive committee began to wane, other groups and leaders became active; in particular, the Supreme Muslim Council (and its president, Haj Amin al-Husseini) became involved in anti-Zionist activities. In 1931 Amin Husseini began organising an international conference of Muslim delegates, political and religious, Sunni and Shia, from around the world to be held in Jerusalem. He obtained permission from retiring High Commissioner John Chancellor, on the condition that the conference did not discuss British policies. On 7 December 1931, 145 delegates from 22 Islamic countries assembled in Jerusalem. Delegates included Abdelaziz Thâalbi (Tunisia), Rida Tawfiq (Turkey), Muhammad Iqbal (India) and delegates from the Wafd (Egypt). Maulana Shaukat Ali (India) helped organise the event. The Indian delegates wanted the restoration of the Caliphate on the agenda, but al-Husseini maintained the focus on Muslim support for Palestinians. Zia'eddin Tabatabaee, former prime minister of Iran, developed plans for the establishment of an Islamic University in Jerusalem, and would later travel with al-Husseini in 1933 to Iraq and India to raise funds for the project.Kayyali, p.165Khalidi, Walid p.107Pappe pp.155,156 It lasted for two weeks, electing an executive committee and proposing the establishment of branches throughout the Muslim world. It affirmed the holiness of the Al-Aqsa mosque (including the Burqa) and the importance of Palestine to all Muslims, announcing plans for an Islamic university (the Aqsa Mosque University) and an Islamic land company to prevent Zionists from buying land in Palestine. The final session denounced Western imperialism in Muslim countries.Kayyali. pp.165,166 The conference may be seen as the end of the Palestine Arab Congress. It split the Palestinian national movement by excluding Christians, and was bitterly opposed by Amin al-Husseini's critics. Fakhri al-Nashashibi organised a rival event at the King David Hotel, calling it \\"The Conference of the Islamic Nation\\". None of the conference proposals came to fruition, although it consolidated Amin al-Husseini's position as a leader of the Palestinian anti-Zionist movement.Pappe. p.257 As the congress was ending, a group of about 50 delegates (primarily from Palestine and Syria) met at Awni Abdul Hadi's house and issued an Arab National Charter. This group (and the charter) evolved into the Istiqal Party.Kayyali. pp 166,167 ==Aftermath== After the death of Musa Kazim on 27 March 1934, Christian executive vice- president Yacoub Farraj became acting president. No agreement could be reached for a permanent successor, and no further Congresses were held. Its role was surpassed by a number of Palestinian Arab political parties representing the interests of particular families and individuals, or identifying with specific locations: the Istiqlal (1932), National Defence Party (1934), Arab Reform Party (1935), National Bloc Party (1935) and the Palestine Arab Party (1935). In 1932 a small group was formed in the Jaffa-Ramleh area, the Palestine Youth Party.Survey. pp.947-950 ==Other Palestinian congresses, 1920–1930Arab Orthodox Congress: Haifa, 1923=== Arab members of the Greek Orthodox Church held a congress in Haifa on 15 July 1923. Many Palestinian members of the Greek Orthodox Church were active in anti-Zionism, particularly as editors and publishers of newspapers (including Isa Daoud Isa and Najib Nassar). The congress was called after Patriarch Damianus I's sale of land to Zionists for 200,000 Egyptian pounds, a sale which rescued the patriarchate of Jerusalem from bankruptcy. A secondary issue was the patriarch's support for a British- proposed legislative assembly. The Congress passed a resolution demanding that the patriarch should not speak on behalf of the community without the approval of a mixed council composed of two-thirds lay members and one-third clergy. Other resolutions called for the election of bishops by local councils, knowledge of Arabic by patriarchal representatives, control of church endowments by the Arab community and improvements in Orthodox education and welfare.Roussos, Sotiris Patriarchs, Notables and Diplomats. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem in the Modern Period. from O'Mahony, Anthony (editor) (2004) Eastern Christianity. Studies in Modern History, Religion and Politics. Melisende. . A second Arab Orthodox conference was held in Jaffa on 28 October 1931. ===Women's Congress=== A Women's Congress, attended by 200 women, was convened in 1929. Organisers included Wahida al- Khalidi (wife of Hussein al-Khalidi) and Amina al-Husayni (wife of Jamal al- Husayni). It was led by Salma al-Husayni, wife of Musa Kazim.Pappe. p.266 ==References== Category:1920s in Mandatory Palestine Category:Arab nationalism in Mandatory Palestine Category:History of Mandatory Palestine Category:Palestinian nationalism Category:Palestinian politics ","title":"Palestine Arab Congress"},{"id":"35952754","text":"Hermann Neufert (6 July 1858 in Altstadt near Lüben, Province of Silesia, Prussia – 1935 in Berlin, Germany) was a German educator who founded (along with Prof. Dr. Bernhard Bendix) the world's first open air school, and the international movement which followed.Würzige Waldluft.

Chimalapas is a region with a large biodiversity and due to that it is of interest to, among others, the federal government, state governments, and a variety of companies. Therefore, throughout history several claims have been laid on this area. This goes against the will of the Zoque people, who want to take care of this land as they have done ever since they started living in this area.Miguel Angel García A., \\"La historia Chimalapa: una paciente y tenaz lucha indígena por un rico territorio en disputa\\" , written 1999, accessed at May 27, 2012 ==Area== Chimalapas is primarily located in southeastern Oaxaca and partially in western Chiapas. It is one of the bioregions of top importance in all of Mesoamerica. A variety of ecosystems exists in this area, including rainforests, cloud forests, and pine forests. Chimalapas is also inhabited by a large variety of animal and plant species. Although Chimalapas has a great biodiversity, is not a wildlife reserve or a protected space. The Mexican government has repeatedly tried to classify it that way, but due to the adamant refusal of indigenous communities in the area this has not succeeded. The health, existence, and high quality of conservation of the ecosystems of the Chimalapas area are seen as a direct result of the deliberate care of the indigenous communities living in the area.Miguel Angel García A.\\"La historia Chimalapa: una paciente y tenaz lucha indígena por un rico territorio en disputa\\" , written 1999, accessed at May 27, 2012Umlas E., \\"Environmental Networking in Mexico: The Comite Nacional para la Defensa de los Chimalapas\\", Latin American Research Review, 1998, pp. 161-189 It is estimated that a single hectare in the region can host up to 900 plant species and over 200 animal species. http://www2.inecc.gob.mx/publicaciones/consultaPublicacion.html?id_pub=28 It houses 149 species of mammals. http://www.scielo.org.mx/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid;=S0065-17372012000300006 ==Inhabitants== The original inhabitants of the area are the Zoque people. They are descendants of the Olmeca people, who have lived in Chimalapas for more than 2,500 years. Though the Zoque people are the official land owners, there are currently many different groups of people living within Chimalapas. These ethnic groups include the Chinantecos, Mixtecos, Zapotecos, Tzotziles, Tzeltales, and the Zoque Olmecas.Miguel Angel García A., \\"La historia Chimalapa: una paciente y tenaz lucha indígena por un rico territorio en disputa\\" , written 1999, accessed at May 27, 2012Teresa de Jesús Portador García and Octavio A. Solórzano Tello, \\"Conflictos agrarios en el municipio de Santa María Chimalapa, Oaxaca(México): La disputa por el territorio\\", \\"Bogotá (Colombia) Volumen XIII No 24\\", 2009, pp.45-68 ==History== Before the Spanish arrived in Mexico, the Zoque people of Chimalapas, Tabasco and Chiapas, with the Mixes and Popolucas, were a peaceful people who were trading extensively with each other. By 1300, the Zapotecs, coming from the Central Valleys of Oaxaca, separated the Mixes and the Zoques when they conquered parts of the land. Later on, in 1447, the Mexica, as they passed through the Isthmus towards Chiapas and Guatemala, cut the alliance between the Popolucas and the Mixes, and they defeated the Zoque people of Tabasco and Chiapas, after which they forced them to pay tribute. Since then, the Mexica, allied with the Zapotecs, conquered and plundered various towns of the Zoque, which affected the trade seriously.Miguel Angel García A., \\"La historia Chimalapa: una paciente y tenaz lucha indígena por un rico territorio en disputa\\" , written 1999, accessed at May 27, 2012 When eventually the Spanish arrived in Mexico they initially did not enter the Chimalapas, since the dense jungle was no easy terrain. However, in 1647 Burgoa Fran Francis tells of the Chimalapas land and its peoples and quickly this land came under the rule of the Spanish. Then on March 24, 1687, the priest Domingo Pintado paid twenty-five thousand pesos in gold to the Crown of Spain for the lands of Santa María (the Chimalapas were then one community), which existed of 900.000 hectares. Then he resold this back to the Zoque people, arguing that by not getting robbed of their land they had to pay gourds filled with gold. That is also where the name Chimalapas comes from; it means “golden gourd”.Umlas E., \\"Environmental Networking in Mexico: The Comite Nacional para la Defensa de los Chimalapas\\", Latin American Research Review, 1998, pp. 161-189 In 1842, large areas of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec were devoted to build an interoceanic railway. Because of this project the Zoques of the Chimalapas asked the president Jose Joaquin Herrera in 1850 for the ratification of the colonial title, which was granted.Teresa de Jesús Portador García and Octavio A. Solórzano Tello, \\"Conflictos agrarios en el municipio de Santa María Chimalapa, Oaxaca(México): La disputa por el territorio\\", \\"Bogotá (Colombia) Volumen XIII No 24\\", 2009, pp. 45–68 From then until the 20th century, the Zoque of the Chimalapas remained in their forests and jungles as the only people present, with relatively little direct attacks. However, in the meantime estates got created on paper, and further studies were done to open different interoceanic routes through the area. Furthermore, forests were being cleared on the borders of the Chimalapas area.Miguel Angel García A., \\"La historia Chimalapa: una paciente y tenaz lucha indígena por un rico territorio en disputa\\" , written 1999, accessed at May 27, 2012 With the agrarian revolution of 1910–1915 and the consequent change in legislation, the Zoque were again forced to seek recognition of their lands, which became invaded by farms in the north and west. At that time, the Zoque made a big mistake by agreeing with having no private ownership of the land, but that they only used the land, and will not populate or colonize the jungle. They remained in the central and western part of the territory and saw the eastern part as a collection area, hunting and nature reserve. Due to this error, landowners, loggers and ranchers, especially from Chiapas, came to gain profit from this land. Between 1911 and 1920 the first group of Zapotec migrants came to the area, fleeing revolutionary violence. This was the start of the formation of the multi- ethnic population that currently exists in the Chimalapas. Furthermore, from 1980 to 1989, the entire eastern part of the Chimalapas became violently colonized by indigenous Tzeltal and Tzotzil people from Chiapas, which made the territorial issue even more complex. Since 1947, five large timber companies, with the full support of the government of Chiapas, started clearing the forest from the east. This was done under the pretext that these lands were in Chiapas territory and were not of anyone (since the error made earlier). Therefore, this part of Chimalapas was declared as public lands belonging to Chiapas. The clearing operation ceased in 1977, when the laborers and workers of the companies went on strike, since they were not allowed to plant their own fields. Then they joined forces with the Zoque villagers in the area who were fighting for their land, and together they started driving out loggers and farmers. The laborers and workers who joined the villagers in this struggle then asked for admission to the community and for the foundation of five communal congregations in the east of the Chimalapas.Miguel Angel García A., \\"La historia Chimalapa: una paciente y tenaz lucha indígena por un rico territorio en disputa\\" , written 1999, accessed at May 27, 2012 The official recognition of the Zoque territory of the Chimalapas was achieved only in 1967, when President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz divided the original community into Santa María and San Miguel, which together formed about 594.000 ha.Website San Miguel Chimalapa \\"Voces de la Selva\\" , December 1, 2012, accessed May 27, 2012 With this the Chimalapas area of the Zoque suffered a loss of 300.000 ha that had been indicated to be theirs in the original titles. Also, although the communities now had Presidential Resolution, this was not physically carried out until 1992.Miguel Angel García A., \\"La historia Chimalapa: una paciente y tenaz lucha indígena por un rico territorio en disputa\\" , written 1999, accessed at May 27, 2012Teresa de Jesús Portador García and Octavio A. Solórzano Tello, \\"Conflictos agrarios en el municipio de Santa María Chimalapa, Oaxaca(México): La disputa por el territorio\\", \\"Bogotá (Colombia) Volumen XIII No 24\\", 2009, pp.45-68 In order to stop the conflicts the Zoque communities of the Chimalapas determined in 1991 that most ejidatarios of Chiapas are as indigenous and poor as them and that they were both victim of deception and manipulation by the government. Therefore, they decided to start a program, without government intervention, aiming at signing agreements with the indigenous peasants of Chiapas, on the following basis: # The conflict between states should be forgotten, because all are farmers and Mexicans. # There should be mutual respect and absolute possession of the true land by the peasants who live in Chimalapas. # There should be no provocation and aggression among commoners and landowners, but peace among the peasants. # It is not allowed to create new settlements in the region. # There should be mutual support to defend and protect the mountain (especially in preventing and combating forest fires). During that time government of Chiapas was accused of threatening to stop this program and of forcing to withdraw the agreements that had been signed. From that time on violence increased in the Chimalapas area.Teresa de Jesús Portador García and Octavio A. Solórzano Tello, \\"Conflictos agrarios en el municipio de Santa María Chimalapa, Oaxaca(México): La disputa por el territorio\\", \\"Bogotá (Colombia) Volumen XIII No 24\\", 2009, pp.45-68Miguel Angel García A., \\"La historia Chimalapa: una paciente y tenaz lucha indígena por un rico territorio en disputa\\" , written 1999, accessed at May 27, 2012 Because nothing had changed in the meantime, in 1993, 110 indigenous people from Chimalapas moved to Mexico City where they made an international complaint. This resulted in the signing of an Act of Agreements at the end of the year between the communities, the National Committee for the Defence of Chimalapas, the Federal Government, and the governments of Oaxaca and Chiapas, in which they point to the following governmental commitments: # A definitive solution to the agricultural conflict, evicting invasive private farmers and giving a different treatment to the ejidos of Chiapas, incorporating their land into communal possession. # An end to the violation of indigenous human rights. # Respect for the community process to establish their own Campesino Ecological Reserve. These agreements were only partially fulfilled in the following years. Instead, since 1998, the new interim governor of Chiapas, Roberto Albores, restarted a policy of \\"defense of the state of Chiapas\\", resulting in continued practices of logging and building of settlements.Miguel Angel García A., \\"La historia Chimalapa: una paciente y tenaz lucha indígena por un rico territorio en disputa\\" , written 1999, accessed at May 27, 2012 At the same time when these problems continued occurring in the east, there were also problems in the west. The major threats to the forest are national development projects, illegal logging and ranching.http://ae.americananthro.org/index.php/molly- doanes-stealing-shining-rivers-transnational-conservation-meets-a-mexican- forest/ The Community of Santa María and the colony Cuauhtémoc have had a longduring conflict. This conflict was born in 1957 with the creation of this colony in the historically communal territory. This territory was still not legally recognized by the new governments at that time. While the people of the Chimalapas did not get the demarcation of their communal lands throughout the following years, the colony was claiming more and more land of Chimalapas until they had claimed up to 12.850 ha in 2003.Teresa de Jesús Portador García and Octavio A. Solórzano Tello, \\"Conflictos agrarios en el municipio de Santa María Chimalapa, Oaxaca(México): La disputa por el territorio\\", \\"Bogotá (Colombia) Volumen XIII No 24\\", 2009, pp. 45–68 This conflict exploded violently in April 1998 when 22 settlers who were cutting down trees of the jungle were stopped by an indigenous committee and taken to prison in Santa María. This resulted in 900 policemen besieging Santa Maria, taking seven people to jail. After this violent situation, the government of Oaxaca and la Secretaría de la Reforma Agraria (SRA) promised to the community a “prompt” solution, which once again became trapped in bureaucratic and legal procedures, meetings, and so on. Then, in May of that year, the Community Assembly of Santa Maria decided to delimit its boundaries with Cuauhtémoc on the ground “with the government or without it”, which again put up the risk of violence.Miguel Angel García A., \\"La historia Chimalapa: una paciente y tenaz lucha indígena por un rico territorio en disputa\\" , written 1999, accessed at May 27, 2012 ==Recent developments== In the meantime, nothing much has changed. The agrarian problem, together with the interstate border conflict between Oaxaca and Chiapas has made the situation very complex.Teresa de Jesús Portador García and Octavio A. Solórzano Tello, \\"Conflictos agrarios en el municipio de Santa María Chimalapa, Oaxaca(México): La disputa por el territorio\\", \\"Bogotá (Colombia) Volumen XIII No 24\\", 2009, pp.45-68 The Oaxacan governor Gabino Cué has met the presidents of the communal land of Santa María and San Miguel Chimalapa, iterating that he wanted to find ways to resolve the problems they have with the states of Veracruz and Chiapas. However, in the meantime still nothing has changed and invasions keep taking place. Again the villagers have been taking the right in their own hands by blocking roads to Chiapanec settlements in the east.Website San Miguel Chimalapa \\"Voces de la Selva\\" , December 1, 2012, accessed May 27, 2012 Around the same time the governor of Chiapas, Juan Sabines Guerrero, publicly announced the creation of a new municipality in Chimalapas: Belisario Domínguez, which is now the basis of one of the most intense conflicts in the area.Website San Miguel Chimalapa \\"Autoridades municipales de los Chimalapas presentan recurso de reclamación ante la SCJN para la defensa de su territorio y bienes naturales comunes\\" , published February 16, 2012, accessed May 27, 2012Article in Vanguardia news \\"Denuncian nueva invasión en Chimalapas\\", published January 16, 2012, accessed May 27, 2012 In the west the issues concerning Cuauhtémoc continue. On February 25, 2004 the President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, gave formal recognition of the possession of the 12.850 acres, that Cuauhtémoc had taken before, to the community of Santa María Chimalapa.

Montgomerie started out playing with his local Scottish Junior club Saltcoats Victoria before signing for Newcastle United where he spent his formative years in the senior ranks from 1979 until 1981. After returning to Scotland, Montgomerie signed for the Sons where he played right-back for seven seasons from 1981 until 1988, having scored 8 goals in 180 league appearances. Montgomerie then moved to Kilmarnock for £12,000 in the 1988 close season, where he was soon moved to centre-back and would be appointed the club's captain thereafter. Montgomerie's first match for Killie was in Dumfries at Palmerston Park versus Queen of the South on 13 August 1988. Montgomerie was proud to captain the club that won the 1997 Scottish Cup Final at Ibrox Stadium, as he was to become a great modern-day player with the East Ayrshire outfit, having a never-say-die spirit and enthusiasm that the Killie supporters loved to see. After just over a decade at Killie, Monty (as he was more well known) was awarded a testimonial match versus Celtic in July 1998. Montgomerie scored 7 goals in 313 league appearances for Killie. In a poll conducted by Football Focus in 2005, Montgomerie was voted by the Killie fans as the club's all-time cult hero. Montgomerie's final match for Killie was at home versus Rangers on 28 February 1999. After leaving Rugby Park, Montgomerie signed for Partick Thistle for the 1999-2000 season but after his spell at Firhill, where he played in 32 league matches, he returned to Killie in a match-day hospitality capacity before becoming a publican in Saltcoats and was also the chairman of Saltcoats Victoria.

She won her first six races including the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and the Prix de Diane as a three-year-old in 2011. In May 2012, she defeated Cirrus des Aigles to win the Prix d'Ispahan. ==Background== Golden Lilac is a bay filly with a narrow white blaze. She was bred in Ireland by the German-based Ammerland Stud. Golden Lilac was sent into training with André Fabre and has been ridden in most of her races by Maxime Guyon. She was sired by The Derby winner Galileo out of Grey Lilas, a mare who won the Prix du Moulin in 2004. ==Racing career2010: two-year-old season=== Golden Lilac made her first appearance in a maiden race at Saint-Cloud on 8 September. She started favourite and won by a neck from Elusive Eria. She returned to the same track in October to win a minor stakes race by two lengths from Rosehill Dew. ===2011: three-year-old season=== Golden Lilac made her three-year-old debut in the Group Three Prix de la Grotte at Longchamp in April. She was settled in fourth place by Guyon before taking the lead in the closing stages and winning \\"comfortably\\" by one and a half lengths. In winning the Prix de la Grotte, she emulated her dam, Grey Lilas, who took the same race in 2004. Three weeks later, the filly returned to Longchamp for the Group One Poule d'Essai des Pouliches, the French equivalent of Britain's 1000 Guineas. Ridden by Olivier Peslier (Guyon was unavailable because of a suspension) she went clear in the straight and won by three lengths from Glorious Sight. Her performance was described as \\"dominating\\" by The Blood-Horse correspondent. In June, Golden Lilac was matched against the highly regarded Galikova in the Prix de Diane over 2100m at Longchamp. As in some of earlier races, Golden Lilac pulled hard in the early stages before being settled by Guyon. She took the lead in the straight and held off the challenge of Galikova to win by a length. After a break of more than two months, Golden Lilac returned to the racecourse in the Prix Guillaume d'Ornano at Deauville. She started favourite but lost her unbeaten record, finishing third to Galikova. Golden Lilac did run again in 2011. At the end of the year, Golden Lilac was voted Champion three-year-old filly by French journalists. In the 2011 World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings, Golden Lilac was ranked the eighth best three-year-old filly in the world. ===2012: four-year-old season=== Golden Lilac made her first appearance in more than nine months when she contested the Prix d'Ispahan at Longchamp on 27 May. Starting at odds of 4.3/1, she pulled hard in the early stages before being moved up by Guyon to take the lead in the closing stages with a \\"potent turn of foot\\". She ran on strongly to win by three quarters of a length from the odds on favourite Cirrus des Aigles. After the race, Fabre described the win as \\"probably her best performance\\" and mentioned the Prince of Wales's Stakes and the Prix Jacques Le Marois as possible future targets. Golden Lilac made her next appearance in the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket on 13 July. She started 10/11 favourite but ran poorly, finishing ninth of the ten runners behind Giofra. Fabre claimed that Golden Lilac was unsuited by the soft ground. Golden Lilac returned to France for the Prix Rothschild at Deauville for which she started 7/10 favourite. She finished second behind the English- trained three-year-old Elusive Kate, who led from the start and won by one and three quarter lengths. Golden Lilac ran again at Deauville in August when she raced against colts in the Prix Jacques Le Marois. She finished seventh of the eleven runners behind Excelebration.

It was formed in April 2007 by merging 100 wards of the erstwhile Municipal Corporation of Hyderabad (MCH) with twelve municipalities of neighbouring two districts. GHMC covers an area of , spread over the four districts—Hyderabad, Ranga Reddy, Medchal–Malkajgiri and Sangareddy. The GHMC is divided into five zones and eighteen circles that contain 150 municipal wards. Each ward is headed by a corporator, elected by popular vote. The corporators elect The City Mayor who is the titular head of GHMC. The executive powers of the GHMC lie with the Municipal Commissioner appointed by the Government of Telangana. The State Election Commission (SEC) monitors the municipal elections that are held in the city once in every five years. The first election of the GHMC were held in December 2009. The Indian National Congress alliance with Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen formed the majority, with the agreement of sharing the mayor post equally between the two parties. The Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) an area of , is a jurisdiction which contains some suburbs of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. The SCB area houses multiple camps of the Indian Army and Indian Air Force, the civic administration and infrastructure of this area is overseen by SCB rather than GHMC. The chief executive officer (a civilian) appointed by the Indian Defense Ministry possesses the executive powers while the board president is an Indian army commander of the Brigadier grade, stationed in Secunderabad. The Osmania University a part of modern Hyderabad is an area of administered independently by its management. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) was formed in 2008 as an umbrella authority by merging multiple local development bodies. The jurisdiction of HMDA extends to 54 mandals located in five districts with a total area of . It manages the development activities of the area including the administration of the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB), the Telangana Transmission Corporation, and the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC). The Hyderabad City Police, established in 1847, is the law and order enforcement agency. Hyderabad Police Commissionerate jurisdiction is divided into five police zones, each headed by a Deputy Commissioner. The Hyderabad Traffic Police is headed by a Deputy Commissioner who is answerable to the Hyderabad City Police Commissioner. The area under the jurisdiction of Hyderabad City Police is smaller than the GHMC area, thus the suburbs of the city falls under the jurisdiction of Cyberabad Police Commissionerate. As of 2012, The \\"Greater Hyderabad Police Commissionerate\\" is a proposed plan of Telangana Government which would be formed by merging Hyderabad Police Commissionerate and Cyberabad Police Commissionerate. There will be four zones, each headed by Police commissioner, who will be reporting to the chief Commissioner. Hyderabad houses the offices of the local governing bodies, along with the Telangana Legislature Assembly, the Telangana Secretariat, the Hyderabad High Court. Under the jurisdiction of High Court comes the lower city civil court and the Metropolitan Criminal Court. Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation area contains 24 state Legislative Assembly constituencies which come under five Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Parliament of India) constituencies. ==Utility services== Heavy rains form blocked roads and sewage system. Electricity, water and sewerage services to general public were first commissioned in 1925, with the establishment of The City Endowment Board. Rainwater harvesting, water and sewerage services are regulated by the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWSSB). The HMWSSB sources water supply from multiple dams located in the suburbs of the city. To meet the growing consumption requirement and to provide regular water supply in the city, in 2005 the HMWSSB started operating -long water supply piple-line from Nagarjuna Sagar Dam. The HMWSSB operates a service named \\"Dial-a-Tanker\\" to provide water in emergencies to the residents of the city. A registered customer can obtain the water tanker with the payment of minimal charges. The rapid economical growth leading to the rise in the city's population and consequent increased demand of water has further jeopardised the water shortage of the city which receives scanty rainfall. The region's ground water levels are shrinking, and dams are facing water shortages. Inadequately treated effluents from industrial treatment plants are polluting the drinking water sources of the city. The electricity is regulated through Telangana Central Power Distribution Company. Fire services are provided by the Andhra Pradesh Fire Services department, headed by a director general. The institution was established by the Telangana Fire Services act of 1999. As of March 2012, there are 13 fire stations in Hyderabad and the annual budget for the service was . The Indian Postal Service is the major service provider in the city with five head post offices and multiple sub-post offices; many private courier services also operate in the city. In 1999, the AP state government launched e-Seva (electronic service) services for multiple utility agency's bill payment from one platform. The e-Seva is integrated with the departments of central and state governments. ==Environment== The city produces around 4,500 metric tonnes of solid waste everyday, which is transported from three collection units located in Imlibun, Yousufguda and Lower Tank Bund to the garbage dumping site of Jawaharnagar. The \\"Integrated Solid Waste Management\\" project was started in 2010 by GHMC to manage the waste disposal in the city. The project started with a sum of 4.34 billion, funded by the state government. The Telangana Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) is a regulatory and screening authority of pollution in Hyderabad. The rapid rate of urbanisation with increased economic activities had encouraged migration and industries in Hyderabad, these changes led to an increase of air pollution, industrial waste, sound pollution and water pollution. The city is among the 16 most polluted cities of India, transportation vehicles are the main source of air pollution in the city. Every year there are around 1 million vehicles registrations in the city that increase air and sound pollution. The estimated deaths from particulate matter are about 1700–3000 persons every year in Hyderabad. * * As of 2006, the air pollution statistics are 20–50% from vehicle, 40–70% combining vehicle discharge with road dust, 10–30% from industrial discharges and 3–10% from household garbage burning. Hyderabad houses 140 large and small size lakes in and around the city and As of 1996, there are 834 water tanks of below the size of 10 hectare. The ground water in Hyderabad has total water hardness up to 1000 ppm.

During this time he published his first papers on the mollusks and trees of northwest Louisiana and began collecting fossils. This led him to study biology at Harvard University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in 1893, a Master of Arts in 1894, and completing his Ph.D in 1903 with a thesis titled Eocene and Oligocene Corals of the United States. Before receiving his doctorate, he also worked as an assistant geologist for the United States Geological Survey from 1894 to 1903. ==Career== Vaughan participated in a number of geological surveys of the West Indies (1901 and 1914), Panama Canal Zone (1911), the Dominican and Haitian Republics (1919 to 1921), the Virgin Islands and eastern Puerto Rico (1919), and the Atlantic and Gulf Coast Plains (1907–1923). Earlier in his career Vaughan published many papers and several monographs on corals and coral reefs. He investigated the corals of Florida and the Bahamas from 1908 to 1915 under the auspices of the Department of Marine Biology of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Later he studied the Larger Foraminifera. In 1924 Vaughan became the second director of the Scripps Institution for Biological Research, suggested by outgoing director William Emerson Ritter. During Vaughan's tenure, the institution was refocused to concentrate on oceanography and was renamed the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.Shor, Elizabeth N, \\"The Role of T.

The area under the municipality increased from to in 2007 when the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation was created. As a consequence, the total population leaped from 3,637,483 in 2001 census to 6,809,970 in 2011 census, an increase of over 87%. By comparison, the city population in 1897 was 415,039. Migrants from rest of India constitute 24% of the city population. The sex ratio is 945 female per 1000 males, higher than the national average of 926 per 1000. Among children aged 0–6 years, 373,794 are boys and 352,022 are girls giving rise to the ratio of 942 girls per 1000 boys. The city's population density is . Hyderabad city's literacy rate is 82.96% (male 85.96% and female 79.79%), higher than the national average of 74.04%. Hyderabad city is governed by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation that comes under the Hyderabad Urban Agglomeration, which has a population of 7.7 million the sixth most populous urban agglomeration in the country, with 3,985,240 males and 3,764,094 are females. A proposal to expand the area covered by the city to make it by merging the surrounding gram panchayats and around 30 villages is being considered, as of 2009. ==Ethnic groups, Language and Religion== Residents of Hyderabad are called Hyderabadi and Telugu people and Hyderabadi Muslims comprise the majority of Hyderabad's population. The minority communities of Hyderabad are Kannadiga (including Nawayathi), Marwari, Odia , Bengali, Tamil, Malayali, Gujrati, Marathis, Hindavi, Iranian, Punjabi, Pathan, and Turkish. Among the foreign-origin communities Yemeni Arabs form the majority with African Arabs, Iranian, Pathani and Turks as minorities - who kept settling here during Muslim rule, but which declined after the inception of Hyderabad State into the Indian Union. Telugu and Urdu are the official languages of Hyderabad, while English is commonly used. Telugu in Hyderabad has a varied dialect called the Telangana dialect, and the Urdu spoken in the city is called Deccani Urdu. A significant population of the city speaks different languages such as Hindi, Marathi, Odia, Bengali, Kannada, Tamil and Malayalam. * * * Though Hindus form a majority of the population, Muslims have substantial presence across the city and are predominant in and around Old City. The other religious communities are French-speaking Christian, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist and Parsi.

After a successful flight to Khartoum it was returned to England, where it was used for training by the RNAS. When built it was the largest successful aircraft that had been constructed in Britain.Lewis 1962, p.461 It was also known as the Short Nile Pusher Biplane Seaplane. ==Development== Realising that operation in the hot climate of Egypt would require an aircraft with a low wing-loading, McClean got Shorts to modify one of his Short S.27 biplanes by fitting it with extended wings. This proved underpowered, and Shorts therefore constructed a new aircraft for McClean, using a Gnome Double Lambda two-row rotary engine.Barnes 1967, pp.64–65 Of similar configuration to the modified S.27, the S.80 was an unequal-span three-bay pusher biplane, with a nacelle mounted on the lower wing to accommodate pilot and passengers in two pairs of side-by- side seats, with the engine behind them driving a pusher propeller. The nacelle was extended forward to carry a front-mounted elevator mounted on upswept outriggers, and the empennage, consisting of a high-mounted tailplane and elevator with a pair of rudders mounted below, was carried on wire-braced wooden booms behind the wings. A pair of rectangular-section unstepped floats were mounted below the wing, supplemented by a pair of airbags mounted at the end of each lower tailboom. ==Operational history== The S.80 was first flown by Gordon Bell on 2 October 1913, and on 19 November a weight carrying trial was made, in which it was flown with five passengers. It was then dismantled and shipped to Alexandria aboard the SS Corsican Prince. ===The Nile Expedition=== After reassembly at the Naval Dockyard in Alexandria, McClean, Alec Ogilvie, Horace Short and the expedition mechanic Gus Smith flew the to Cairo on 2 January 1914. This was the limit of the aircraft's range, and Spottiswoode had to establish a set of fuel dumps at intervals along the planned route. Once this had been done the party set off for Upper Egypt, arriving at Aswan on 15 January. Problems were encountered with overheating of the rear row of cylinders, and on taking off from Aswan the performance fell off so badly that after forty miles McClean returned to Aswan, taxiing most of the way. On reaching Aswan it was found that four cylinders needed to be replaced. After these had been sent from Paris the expedition resumed on 16 February, when the flight to Wadi Halfa was made. After two days rest they started the next stage, which followed the course of the Nile round the Great Bend in order to see the second, third and fourth cataracts: this was interrupted by an encounter with a violent dust-storm, which forced McClean to land, damaging one wingtip. After this was repaired the flight continued to Merowe and then to Abu Hamed. On leaving Abu Hamed an oil-pump failed: a landing was made on the river and the aircraft was taxied to Shereyk, where the party waited until a spare pump could be sent. However, soon after leaving Shereyk both oil-pumps failed, and in the resulting emergency landing near Gananita Island a float and the tail-booms were damaged. A ten-day delay followed, and on 14 March they flew to Atbara: the next day Kabushia was reached, where a connecting rod broke, extensively damaging the engine, which was sent back to the railway workshops at Atbara. The repaired engine was fitted by 22 March, when the final stage to Khartoum was completed. After a day of giving joy-rides the aircraft was then dismantled and sent back to England.Barnes 1967, p.67 ===Subsequent history=== On its return to England the S.80 was largely rebuilt, with new wings and tailbooms and a tailplane of reduced chord. The front elevator was deleted, and the nacelle was modified to a side-by side two-seater layout with dual controls, the space formerly occupied by the other two seats now being used for the fuel tank. On 1 August 1914 McClean flew the aircraft to the Isle of Grain and presented it to the Admiralty, where it was re-engined with a Gnome Monosoupape driving a four- bladed propeller and fitted with a fixed fin, half above and half below the tailplane, and given Admiralty number 905. Since it was underpowered it could not take off from calm water in low wind conditions, and was used for taxiing practice by pilots converting from landplanes.Barnes 1967, p.68. ==Specifications See alsoNotesReferences== *Barnes, C.H.

Hyderabadi Haleem, a stew of wheat, lentils and mutton, is also another specialty of the city, originating from the Arab dish Harees. It is usually prepared during the month of Ramadan. Both of these carry Geographical Indication (GI) tags. Others include Hyderabadi Marag, Pathar-ka-Gosht, Maghz Masala, Khatti Dal, Gil-e-Firdaus, Lukhmi and Hyderabadi Khichdi. Irani Chai is enjoyed all over the city, often with Osmania Biscuits.

Telugu cuisine is the part of South Indian cuisine characterized by their highly spicy food. The Telangana state lies on the Deccan plateau and its topography dictates more millet and roti (leavened bread) based dishes. Jowar and Bajra features more prominently in their cuisine. Due to its proximity with Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and northwest Karnataka, it shares some similarities of the Deccan plateau cuisine. The region has the spiciest food amongst all other Telugu and Indian cuisines. Telangana has some unique dishes in its cuisine, such as jonna rotte (sorghum), sajja rotte (penisetum), or Uppudi Pindi (broken rice). In Telangana a gravy or curry is called Koora and Pulusu (Sour) in based on Tamarind. A deep fry reduction of the same is called Vepudu. Kodi pulusu and Mamsam (meat) vepudu are popular dishes in meat. Vankaya Brinjal Pulusu or Vepudu, Aritikaya Banana pulusu or Vepudu are one of the many varieties of vegetable dishes. Telangana palakoora is a spinach dish cooked with lentils eaten with steamed rice and rotis. Peanuts are added as special attraction and in Karimnagar District, cashew nuts are added. Sakinalu also called as Chakinalu, is one of the most popular savory in Telangana, is often cooked during Makara Sankranti festival season. This a deep-fried snack made of rice flour, sesame seeds and flavoured with ajwain (carom seeds or in Telugu). These savories are harder and spicier than the Andhra varieties. Garijelu is a dumpling dish similar to the Maharashtrian karanji, which in Telangana is cooked with sweet stuffing or a savory stuffing with mutton or chicken kheema. ==Architecture== Panorama of Charminar complex, showing the Charminar, Mecca Masjid and Nizamia Hospital A distinct Indo-Islamic architecture style with local contribution is reflected in the historical buildings of Hyderabad, making it the first and \\"Best Heritage City of India\\" as of March 2012. The city houses many famous historical sites constructed during Qutb Shahi and Asaf Jahi period, including various mosques and palaces. Hindu Temple Architecture is also seen in the temples of Hyderabad, including the Birla Mandir, Jagannath Temple and Karmanghat Hanuman Temple. Modern architectural styles are seen in most buildings constructed after independence. ===Qutb Shahi period=== One of the Qutb Shahi Tombs Qutb Shahi architecture of the 16th and early 17th centuries followed classical Persian architecture featuring domes and colossal arches. * The oldest surviving Qutb Shahi structure in Hyderabad is the ruins of Golconda fort built in the 16th century. The most important monuments from this time are the Charminar and Mecca Masjid, both built by Mohammed Quli Qutb Shah, the founder of Hyderabad. Most of the historical bazaars that still exist were constructed on the street north of Charminar towards the fort. The Charminar has become an icon of the city, located in the centre of old Hyderabad. It is a square structure with sides long and four grand arches each facing a road. At each corner stands a -high minaret. The Charminar, Golconda Fort and the Qutb Shahi tombs are considered to be monuments of national importance in India. In 2010, the Indian government proposed that the sites be listed for UNESCO World Heritage status. The style is also seen in the Qutb Shahi Tombs, Taramati Baradari, Khairtabad Mosque and Toli Masjid.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/toli-mosque-under- threat-road-works-go-on-brazenly/articleshow/64131892.cms ===Asaf Jahi period=== In the 17th century, Asaf Jahi architecture emerged with palatial style outweighed secular construction. The earliest examples include the Purani Haveli, which served as the seat of the Nizam until the Chowmahalla Palace was constructed. The Chowmahalla Palace, located a stone's throw away from Charminar was constructed over a period of 100 years. It was recently restored and opened to the public. Another testament to the wealth of Hyderabadi aristocracy is the Falaknuma Palace, built by Sir Vicar-ul-Umra and presented to Mir Mahbub Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VI. It was inspired by Andrea Palladio's villas. The Nizams applied European styles in some of the palaces such as Falaknuma and King Kothi Palaces. Mir Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII is called as the maker of modern Hyderabad. The buildings constructed during his reign are impressive and represent a rich style of Indo-Saracenic architecture, such as the Osmania University, Moazzam Jahi Market, Hyderabad High Court, Osmania General Hospital, City College and Kachiguda Railway Station. These buildings are quite distinct from their earlier Qutb Shahi counterparts. Most of these were designed by British-Indian architect Vincent Esch. The Spanish Mosque, Asman Garh Palace, Errum Manzil, Khursheed Jah Devdi, Mahbub Mansion, Saidani Ma Tomb, Aza Khana-e-Zohra, Hill Fort Palace, Nizamia Hospital, Bashir Bagh Palace (demolished) and Paigah Palace also contribute to the architecture of this period. Shops in the Laad Bazaar ==Bazaars== Bazaars of Hyderabad form an integral part of the charm and add to the rich culture of the city. They are described in the poem \\"In the Bazaars of Hyderabad\\" by Sarojini Naidu. The Old City boasts of a large number of traditional Bazaars. The Laad Bazaar adjacent to the historic Charminar is famous for its artificial bangles, pearls, jewelry, semi-precious stones, as well as Bidriware. Chatta Bazaar is famous for its Urdu Calligraphy wedding invitation cards, which are indispensable for every Hyderabadi Muslim wedding. Other bazaars include Begum Bazaar, Sultan Bazaar and the Moazzam Jahi Market. == Sport == Gachibowli Indoor Stadium Cricket is the most popular game in the city, and association football and racquet sports are also popular. At the professional level, the city has hosted national and international sports events such as the 2002 National Games of India, the 2003 Afro-Asian Games, the 2004 AP Tourism Hyderabad Open women's tennis tournament, the 2007 Military World Games, the 2009 World Badminton Championships and the 2009 IBSF World Snooker Championship. Prominent sportspeople from Hyderabad include V. V. S. Laxman, Mohammed Azharuddin, Sania Mirza, Syed Abdul Rahim and P. V. Sindhu. ==Preservation== Preservation of Hyderabadi Culture is a serious issue. After the Integration of Hyderabad into the Indian Union, a large number of eminent personalities and intellectuals from the erstwhile Hyderabad State migrated to Pakistan. Today, many heritage structures, including the Moazzam Jahi Market, Osmania General Hospital, Mahbub Mansion, King Kothi Palace and the Paigah Tombs lie in a state of neglect. Urdu Calligraphy, or khushkhat, is also a dying art form. Nawab Mehboob Alam Khan states that many of the old recipes that form Hyderabadi cuisine are being lost. ==See also== *Hyderabad *Hyderabadi Muslims * Hyderabadi cuisine *Telugu people * Culture of Telangana * ==External links== * Deccan painting collection. * Dress and Ittar ==References== ","title":"Culture of Hyderabad"},{"id":"35953011","text":"John Boteler, 1st Baron Boteler of Brantfield, (c. 1566 – 27 May 1637) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1625 to 1626.

The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that during the nomination period for candidates, Raul Khajimba and Ardzinba negotiated about running together. The alliance would have combined Ardzinba's backing by part of the business community and his financial resources with Khajimba's elector popularity. The pair said they would run together during two meetings with voters, and the idea was that they would receive the joint nomination by the Forum of the National Unity of Abkhazia. According to the Kommersant, in the end the pair could not agree on what positions they would get. Khajimba wanted the Presidency, and offered Ardzinba to become Prime Minister, but this was not acceptable to the latter. The congress of the Forum of the National Unity of Abkhazia planned on 29 October was called off, and Ardzinba was instead nominated by an initiative group that day. Khajimba had already been nominated by an initiative group on 19 October. Nevertheless, on 18 November Khajimba and Ardzinba announced that they would continue to coordinate their campaigns, and that they had appointed chairman of Aruaa Vadim Smyr to lead this coordination. On 20 November, Khajimba stated that he and Ardzinba had different visions on coming to power, but that he did not consider Ardzinba his opponent, and that in the case of a second round, he, Ardzinba and Butba would support each other. ===Nomination=== Zaur Ardzinba was nominated by an initiative group on 29 October, with former Ochamchira District Governor Khrips Jopua as Vice-Presidential candidate. ===Election campaign=== 20 November, Zaur Ardzinba requested of the Central Election Commission that it publish the names of the members of the central, district and divisional election commissions, including those abroad. On 24 November, Ardzinba gave a press conference in which he stated that if he were elected President, he would do everything to bring together the fragmented people of Abkhazia and to remove the divide between 'us' and 'them'. He also declared that he would make use of qualified people in the government administration, from all political camps. On 11 December, Ardzinba declared that while the power-sharing agreement that resolved the 2004 post-election crisis had meant to bring an end to the division in the Abkhazian society, it had in fact failed to do so, and that he meant to correct that. He added that while the 2004 election had been 'stolen', the opposition would not allow that to happen this time. Ardzinba also spoke out against the size of the bureaucracy, lamenting the duplication of functions. ==Result== According to the official result, Ardzinba came in third place, garnering 9296 votes (9.14% of the total). ==Death== Ardzinba died on 15 April 2015 at the age of 64. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Abkhaz politicians Category:Candidates in the 2009 Abkhazian presidential election ","title":"Zaur Ardzinba"},{"id":"35953147","text":"The 1988–89 NBA season was Indiana's 13th season in the NBA and 22nd season as a franchise.1988-89 Indiana Pacers ==Draft picks== { class=\\" sortable sortable\\" ! 2C3294; color:#fcc624\\" width=\\"10%\\" Round ! 2C3294; color:#fcc624\\" width=\\"10%\\" Pick ! 2C3294; color:#fcc624\\" width=\\"20%\\" Player ! 2C3294; color:#fcc624\\" width=\\"15%\\" Position ! 2C3294; color:#fcc624\\" width=\\"15%\\" Nationality ! 2C3294; color:#fcc624\\" width=\\"20%\\" College - style=\\"text- align: center\\"  1  2  Rik Smits  C   Marist - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  3  61  Herbert Crook  F   Louisville - style=\\"text-align: center\\"  3  73  Michael Anderson    Drexel } ==RosterRegular seasonSeason standings=== :z - clinched division title :y - clinched division title :x - clinched playoff spot ===Record vs. opponents=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%; text-align:center;\\" - !colspan=261988-89 NBA Records - !width=100Team !FF0000;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"ATL !006400;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"BOS !008080;color:#800080;width=35\\"CHA !FF0000;color:#000000;width=35\\"CHI !000080;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"CLE !008000;color:#00008B;width=35\\"DAL !0000CD;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"DEN !0000FF;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"DET !0000FF;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"GSW !FF0000;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"HOU !000080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"IND !F9160D;color:#1A2E8B;width=35\\"LAC !800080;color:#FFD700;width=35\\"LAL !000000;color:#8B0000;width=35\\"MIA !006400;color:#B22222;width=35\\"MIL !B0170C;color:#00056D;width=35\\"NJN !0000FF;color:#FF8C00;width=35\\"NYK !FF0000;color:#0000FF;width=35\\"PHI !800080;color:#FF4500;width=35\\"PHO !000000;color:#FF0000;width=35\\"POR !0000FF;color:#FFFFFF;width=35\\"SAC !000000;color:#C0C0C0;width=35\\"SAS !005831;color:#FFC322;width=35\\"SEA !36004A;color:#FFFF00;width=35\\"UTA !DC143C;color:#0000CD;width=35\\"WAS -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Atlanta  —  3–1  4–1  4–2  4–2  1–1  0–2  1–5  1–1  1–1  5–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  6–0  4–1  2–2  2–2  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–1  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Boston  1–3  —  6–0  1–3  1–4  1–1  1–1  1–3  1–1  1–1  2–3  2–0  1–1  2–0  2–2  5–1  3–3  3–3  0–2  1–1  2–0  2–0  0–2  1–1  2–4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Charlotte  1–4  0–6  —  1–4  0–4  0–2  0–2  0–4  0–2  0–2  2–2  2–0  0–2  1–1  0–4  2–4  2–4  3–3  0–2  0–2  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–5 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Chicago  2–4  3–1  4–1  —  0–6  2–0  1–1  0–6  1–1  1–1  4–2  1–1  2–0  2–0  6–0  2–2  3–2  1–3  1–1  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  0–2  3–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Cleveland  2–4  4–1  4–0  6–0  —  2–0  2–0  3–3  1–1  1–1  5–1  1–1  0–2  2–0  3–3  4–0  2–2  3–2  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  1–1  1–1  2–2 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Dallas  1–1  1–1  2–0  0–2  0–2  —  3–3  0–2  1–3  1–5  1–1  3–1  0–4  6–0  0–2  1–1  0–2  1–1  1–3  2–2  2–2  5–1  2–2  4–2  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Denver  2–0  1–1  2–0  1–1  0–2  3–3  —  1–1  3–1  4–2  1–1  2–2  1–3  5–1  0–2  1–1  1–1  1–1  1–3  2–2  3–1  3–3  2–2  3–3  1–1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Detroit  5–1  3–1  4–0  6–0  3–3  2–0  1–1  —  1–1  1–1  4–2  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–4  4–0  0–4  5–0  2–0  1–1  2–0  2–0  2–0  2–0  5–0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Golden State  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  3–1  1–3  1–1  —  1–3  1–1  5–1  2–3  4–0  0–2  2–0  2–0  1–1  2–4  2–4  2–3  3–1  2–4  2–2  1–1 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  Houston  1–1  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  5–1  2–4  1–1  3–1  —  2–0  2–2  1–3  4–2  1–1  2–0  0–2  0–2  1–3  3–1  2–2  6–0  2–2  2–4  0–2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  Indiana  1–5  3–2  2–2  2–4  1–5  1–1  1–1  2–4  1–1  0–2  —  1–1  0–2  1–1  2–4  1–3  0–5  0–4  1–1  2–0  1–1  2–0  1–1  1–1  1–3 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  L.A.

Cotton was the son of William Cotton, a London draper. He matriculated from St John's College, Cambridge in 1596 and was admitted at Lincoln's Inn on 13 June 1599. He was a friend and patron of John Lightfoot. He succeeded his father in 1607, inheriting estates in Shropshire and Staffordshire. He lived at Bellaport Hall, Norton in Hales, Shropshire. In 1605, he was elected Member of Parliament for Newcastle-under-Lyme and knighted in 1608. He was appointed to the bench as Justice of the Peace for Shropshire by 1614 to his death, and as a commissioner of oyer and terminer for Wales and the Marches by 1616 to death. He served as Mayor of Newcastle in 1614-15. He was appointed also High Sheriff of Shropshire for 1616–17 and the following year a member of Council of the Marches for life. In 1626 he was elected MP for Shropshire. He was elected MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme again in 1628 and sat until 1629 when Charles I decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. He married twice: firstly Frances (who died in childbirth on 23 November 1606), the daughter of Sir Robert Needham of Shavington Hall and secondly Joyce, the daughter and coheiress of Sir Richard Walsh of Shelsley Walsh, Worcestershire. He died in August 1634 aged 53 and was buried at Norton in Hales. The parish church St Chad's contains a monument with effigies of Cotton and his first wife, Frances. The monument was designed by Inigo Jones around the year 1611, and a drawing by Jones survives. Rowland Cotton was associated with the court of Prince Henry, as was Jones. The tomb is the earliest known architectural work of Inigo Jones, and the design has some similarities with Jones' scenery for the Barriers and the Masque of Oberon.Giles Worsley, Inigo Jones and the European Classical Tradition (Yale, 2007), pp. 6, 8-9. He left no children and his estates reverted to his brother William on the death of his wife. ==References== Category:1581 births Category:1634 deaths Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn Category:Members of the Parliament of England for Newcastle-under-Lyme Category:English MPs 1604–1611 Category:English MPs 1626 Category:English MPs 1628–1629 Category:High Sheriffs of Shropshire ","title":"Rowland Cotton"},{"id":"35953191","text":"Various Sony Walkman products ranging from 1979 to 2016, on display at an expo in Tokyo The following is a partial list of Sony Walkman products (but does not include the original cassette tape devices) which includes products of various formats under the brand. Up to March 2010 Sony built 400 million Walkmans (of which 200,020,000 were original cassette Walkmans) worldwide.walkman-archive.com, Gallery Sony, retrieved 31 May 2020. ==Radio Walkman== A Walkman FM/AM radio receiver from the 2000s Walkman branded portable radio receivers were made originally in 1981 under the \\"FM Walkman\\" name. Various FM, AM and DAB receivers have been made. == CD Walkman (formerly Discman) == See Discman, launch 1984. ==Video Walkman== The original Video Walkman (GV-9) Sony's first brand extension of the Walkman cassette players were portable Video8 cassette recorders with color LCD displays, released 1989. ==DAT Walkman== TCD-D100 DAT Walkman (1997) Portable Digital Audio Tape (DAT) players called DAT Walkman were made. The first model, TCD-D3, was released in 1990. The final model, TCD-D100, was discontinued in Japan in 2005. ==MiniDisc Walkman== MD Walkman logo The first MiniDisc Walkmans (\\"MD WALKMAN\\"), MZ-1 and MZ-2P, were released in 1992. The playback-only MZ-E50 was the smallest and lightest MiniDisc player when released in late 1996.https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/sonyhistory-e.html Production of the final MiniDisc Walkman, MZ-RH1 (Hi-MD), stopped in September 2011.https://www.slashgear.com/sony-mz-rh1-hi-md-walkman-faces-axe-but- minidisc-lives-on-08163902/ === NetMD === NetMD MZ-N707 (2002)hifiengine.com 2020, Sony MZ-N707, retrieved 31 May 2020. Sony expanded MiniDisc's possibilities with the introduction of NetMD (NetworkMD). These allowed the use of a PC to convert music from CDs or MP3s into ATRAC3 format, and use a USB cable to transfer the music to the MiniDisc at a much faster rate than was possible when using a line-in cable. Until end of 1998 4.6 million units of the MD Walkman were built. The MZ-N10 was released in 2002. It was Sony's '10th Anniversary' product, released 10 years after the introduction of the MiniDisc format in 1992. The case was made from a magnesium alloy, and the unit featured a built-in lithium-ion battery which provided 24 hours of battery life. The MZ-N10 allowed music to be transferred from a PC at up to 64 times actual playback speed, not including the time required for audio re- encoding. It was also the first MD Walkman to incorporate the ATRAC DSP TYPE S codec, and is today (2006) the lightest recording MD Walkman ever produced. The accompanying 10th anniversary playback-only MiniDisc Walkman, the MZ-E10, was also released. It is the lightest MD Walkman ever produced, weighing 55 g (including built-in rechargeable battery) with a thickness of 9.9 mm. === Hi- MD === In 2004, Sony introduced the Hi-MD format. Hi-MD Walkmans use 1 GB Hi- MD discs in the same form-factor as regular MiniDiscs, and allow 1 GB of files and/or audio to be stored per disc. They also accept regular MiniDiscs, which can be initialized in Hi-MD mode for 305 MB capacity per disc (with the added ability to store audio and data, like Hi-MD discs). Unlike NetMD, Hi-MD Walkmans allow two-way digital transfers to and from PCs virtually unrestricted. Hi-MD also allows the option to record and transfer audio in lossless linear PCM on standard MiniDiscs and Hi-MD discs. This offers sound quality equal to CD (as opposed to lossy ATRAC codecs used on standard MiniDisc/ NetMD). Hi-MD Walkmans introduced from 2005 onwards allowed direct playback of MP3s without the need to transcode the MP3s to ATRAC format. However, SonicStage is required for transfer onto the disc itself. Playable audio cannot be transferred to the devices without SonicStage. ==DVD Walkman (formerly DVD Discman)== In 1998 portable DVD players called DVD Discman were released. New models from 2001 were rebranded as \\"DVD Walkman\\". ==Memory Stick Network Walkman== Released in 1999, these would be the first \\"memory type\\" Walkman, which remain the only current product type still in production. Initially from 2000 the memory type Walkman were collectively called \\"Network Walkman\\" to distinguish from other types of Walkman such as the cassette one, but by 2005 the branded name for memory type Walkman became solely \\"Walkman\\" which continues to this day. Because Sony did not initially support the MP3 format as other companies in the industry, the players were not officially called \\"MP3 players\\" by Sony. The Memory Stick flash players were officially called \\"Portable Memory Stick Audio Players\\"; embedded flash players were called \\"Portable IC Audio Players\\"; hard disk players were initially called \\"Portable Hard Disk Audio Players\\". From 2005 all were simply called \\"Digital Audio Players\\" and \\"Digital Media Players\\". From 2007 to 2015, Walkman players for export markets had a NWZ- prefix instead of NW-. === NW-MS7 === The NW-MS7 \\"Memory Stick Walkman\\" was introduced September 1999 during a Walkman 20th anniversary event as Sony's first foray into the portable solid state music player industry. The player was very small and light (69 g) with a stylish design.https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/jun/22/onlinesupplement4 It shipped with a white 64 MB MagicGate Memory Stick and built-in battery, selling it alongside the later NW-E3 (64 MB built-in and using two AAA battery for 4-5 hours playtime). The player could only play ATRAC formatted files, Sony's proprietary format, so was not technically an \\"MP3 player\\". The user needed to transfer songs via USB with bundled software OpenMG Jukebox (only works with Windows 98 software, later known as SonicStage). Any files not in the ATRAC format (i.e. MP3s) needed to be converted before they could be transferred and played. Popular software players at the time, such as Winamp, did not support the ATRAC format, leading to users needing to store both MP3 and ATRAC copies of songs on their computers. Additionally, only new MagicGate Memory Sticks were supported. Sony also advertized the player as having \\"robust\\" copyright protection by adhering to standards including Secure Digital Music Initiative. It would only play protected legal music downloads.https://pressreleases.responsesource.com/news/7574/the-sony-memory- stick-walkman-is-here/ It was released in December 1999 in Japan followed by January 2000 in the United States for $399.http://edition.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9909/28/walkman.tunes.idg/index.html It was the first and only memory type Walkman to use the classic \\"WALKMAN\\" logo. In 2000 the current \\"W.\\" logo was created to fit more easily on the increasingly shrinking size of devices, and the Walkman brand was unified.https://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/product/2000/walkman.html === NW-MS9/MS10/MS11 === NW-MS10 (2002, Japan) The Network Walkman line was updated with the NW-MS9/MS11. These came bundled with either 64MB/128MB MagicGate Memory Sticks and used a gumstick type battery. Software continued to use OpenMG. The NW-MS9 now had a thin metal body and had 64 MB of internal memory and was priced $330. Release in Japan of the MS9 was December 2000 and April 2001 in Europe.https://www.sony.jp/CorporateCruise/Press/200010/00-1013/https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/mar/01/onlinesupplement10 In Canada it was released in August 2001.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/sony-releases-network- walkman/article1184867/ NW-MS11 was released in Japan in October 2001 and came with a 128 MB Memory Stick.https://www.sony.jp/CorporateCruise/Press/200109/01-0919/ === NW- MS70D/MS90D === The last Memory Stick-based Network Walkmans were released in 2002, although these new models included internal flash memory. Model NW-MS70D had 256MB of built-in flash memory. It could also be expanded by its MagicGate Memory Stick Duo port. However, at the time, the Memory Stick PRO Duo had not yet been released, so therefore the NW-MS70D maximum capacity would be 384MB with the additional memory stick. The other downside to it was that it was incredibly expensive, costing as much as a 15 GB iPod. It also used a very buggy software, SonicStage, and only played Atrac3, Atrac3plus and WAV files. However, it was the smallest digital audio player at that time, called \\"ultra compact\\" by Sony. It was also solidly built with an aluminium shell and a titanium finish.https://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/product/2000/nw- ms70d.html It boasted a 44-hour battery life. Despite a heavy marketing campaign, its sales were limited. It was much more expensive than iRiver and Mpio players and which did not require SonicStage and ATRAC recoding. Inexpensive Creative Zen and Muvo players also hindered the Sony's sales. The alternate model, the NW-MS90D, used the same software as NW-MS70D, and had a maximum capacity of 640 MB. It too was also extremely expensive. The most eminent change was the 512 MB inbuilt memory and its new black shell. Due to its price and limited capacity, it was still largely ignored by the general public. With both these models, SonicStage software started to gain a negative reception. After this no more Memory Stick type Network Walkman were released. Future Network Walkman would only have embedded flash memory or hard disk. == HDD Network Walkman  NW-HD1 === As Sony was losing market relevance amid the widespread success of Apple's iPod range, the company developed for the first time a hard disk-based player. The NW-HD1 was announced on June 30, 2004 dubbed as “the world’s smallest portable audio device”. It was smaller and was advertised as having better sound quality than the iPod at the time. The HD1 featured a seven line 1.8 inch LED display and had a 20 GB hard disk. The device was brushed in high quality aluminium. However, the unit would only play Sony's proprietary format, ATRAC3, whereas other players on the market would play the open and much more widely used MP3 format without having to be converted to ATRAC3. Sony did upgrade the HD1 to play MP3s but it still needed SonicStage to transfer the files. The NW-HD1 did not sell as well as Sony had hoped - its asking price of $399 was $100 more than a 20 GB iPod. Its successors, the NW-HD3 and NW-HD5, also failed to make a major dent in the iPod's sales. === NW-HD3 === Sony Walkman NW-HD3, the first to support the MP3 format The successor to the hard disk-based NW-HD1, the NW-HD3 was a very similar design, but it could now play MP3s natively. It was announced on November 30, 2004. === NW-HD5 === NW-HD5 Sony's next model, the NW-HD5, was released July 2005 and was an updated design from the HD1 / HD3, boasting a simpler control system, an upright handheld format, a user-removable lithium- ion battery, better file format compatibility, a unique \\"Follow Turn Display\\" that would automatically align itself based on how the player was held on startup, and updated software. A main feature was its advertised running time of 40 hours, when using low-quality format settings, i.e., 48 kbit/s ATRAC3 files, and no player-based audio enhancements (although the player does include these). Playback of 128 kbit/s MP3s was rated at 30 hours. The player was available in black, silver and red and was not sold in the Canadian market. The NW-HD5 was in direct competition with the 4th generation iPod. Unfortunately, the NW-HD5 was shipped with a cosmetic design flaw which meant that the buttons developed small visible cracks under their plastic coating. Although this did not affect functionality, many customers complained. Sony United Kingdom Limited allowed owners to send the units back to be re-fitted with slightly raised, crack-resistant buttons. Perhaps because of this problem, the NW-HD5 was on the market for a very short time before being pulled in preparation for the next model. In January 2006, the NW-HD5 became unavailable as a normal purchase from retail electronics stores and was relegated to online auction sites and used-electronics warehouses as a consumer item. Eventually the whole of the Network Walkman line would be discontinued for Sony's new solution. === NW-A1000/A1200/A3000 === Sony NW-A1000 6GB, flash based player (2005) The A Series digital music player was introduced September 2005 as the top flagship range with an electroluminescent screen, available initially in 6 gigabyte (NW-A1000) and a larger sized 20 gigabyte (NW-3000) versions and later in mid-2006 an 8 gigabyte version (NW-A1200). Battery life can reach 20 and 35 hours respectively. The player supports ATRAC3, MP3, WMA and from firmware version 3.00 it also supports AAC. The player is pebble-shaped and has a highly reflective front, build with a metallic back, and a generally minimalist style. It was available in black, silver, purple, pink and blue, https://www.cnet.com/reviews/sony- nw-a1000-walkman-review/ In its press release, Sony said the series is \\"Simply called 'WALKMAN'\\" thereby dropping the Network name from all its future DAP products.https://www.arabnews.com/node/285590 It was announced a few hours after Apple's first iPod Nano.https://www.macworld.com/article/1046824/sony.html Release in the USA was in 2006. There are a number of features to select music according to a variety of criteria, which Sony advertized as adapting to the listener's \\"individual tastes\\".https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/CorporateInfo/History/sonyhistory-e.html The \\"Artist link\\" function prompts the Walkman to search, find and display similar artists in that genre. There are two new shuffle modes. By selecting \\"My Favourite Shuffle\\", the device automatically selects the 100 most listened to songs and plays them at random. The \\"Time Machine Shuffle\\" function randomly selects a year and plays all of the songs from that particular year currently held on the device. On the left side is an \\"Artist Link\\" button. A recent firmware update (V3.00) added the \\"Artist Link Shuffle\\" function to the list of Intelligent Shuffle modes, along with a clock and calendar. The primary means of putting music on this device (as with previous models) is to use Sony software: SonicStage and Connect Player. The A1000 was the final HDD Walkman when it was discontinued in 2007; after this all Walkman digital audio players would be solely flash memory. ==Flash-based Walkman (formerly Network Walkman)== These are embedded flash memory audio players. This section does not include Memory Stick type Walkman. ===NW-A600 Series=== NW-A605 (2005, Japan) In Japan, the NW-A608/A607/A605 were released in November 2005 along with the NW-A1000/1200/3000.http://www.ipodobserver.com/ipo/article/Sony_Unveils_Five_New_Walkman_Players/M It is a small thumb drive design and successor to the global E Series NW-E50x/E40x. Future devices in Japan in this style would be released under E Series (globally until 2008, after which it was exclusively B Series). === B Series === NWZ-B163FR (2011) The B Series were entry-level, small, USB thumb drive style players with less features than the E Series. The B Series was only for the overseas market (not released in Japan). Original model, released in July 2007, was a line of 1 GB (NWD-B103/B103F) and 2 GB (NWD-B105/105F) multifunction MP3 player and voice recording function. It was the firm's first-ever MP3 player to be liberated from the SonicStage software - allowing simple drag and drophttps://gizmodo.com/sonys-first-drag-and-drop-walkman-to- ditch-sonicstage-255583#! \\\\- but it has been shorn of the ability to play back ATRAC and AAC music files. The Auto-Transfer option allowed this Walkman to search for all the MP3 files on the PC and then copy these files directly to the Walkman. It also could record CDs directly from a Sony compatible Hifi system via USB connection without any PC (the NWD-B105 also supported WMA files). It also came with a three-line colour display; the voice recorder (MP3) came with bit rates of low (96 kbit/s), mid (128 kbit/s) and high. Models with the built-in FM tuner (\\"F\\") had 30 preset stations with a frequency of 87.5–108.0 MHz, with the capability to record and play FM content. The five preset equaliser also had a custom setting option. The NWZ-B140 was introduced in 2009 featuring Sony's ZAPPIN song search technology. The NWZ-B150 series was introduced in April 2010 with a 3 line LCD display. The B160 series was introduced in June 2011. These were followed by B170 series in early 2012, and the current series, B180, in April 2014. The B180 series consists of one 4 GB model, NWZ-B183, and its FM radio variant NWZ-B183F, and has 20 hours of battery life. === E Series === Walkman Bean (2005) NW-Ex/E10/E55/E75/E9x The E series was originally a pure music player without a large LCD display. The first generation players came with 96 MB (NW-E5), 64 MB (NW-E3) or 32 MB (NW-E2) built-in flash memory, instead of the other models at the time with Memory Stick. The player looks like a cigarette lighter deemed \\"ultra compact and light\\" weighing 45 grams.https://www.sony.net/Fun/design/history/product/2000/nw-e3.html The NW-E3 was released in Japan on June 10, 2000 as the very first \\"Network Walkman\\",https://www.sony.jp/CorporateCruise/Press/200005/00-0515/ and from 2001 elsewhere.https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2001/mar/01/onlinesupplement10 The larger capacity NW-E5 was released in Japan in December 2000.https://www.sony.jp/CorporateCruise/Press/200010/00-1013/ These players continue the use of OpenMG software like the Memory Stick Walkman.https://www.sony.jp/CorporateCruise/Press/200010/00-1013/ Models NW-E7 and NW-E10 were first released in Japan in October 2001. The NW-E10 has 128 MB memory, with cited storage for 240 minutes of ATRAC playback.https://www.sony.jp/CorporateCruise/Press/200109/01-0919/ In 2004 models NW-E75 (256 MB) and NW-E55 (128 MB) were released. These have an acrylic finish and come in either silver (NW-E75) or either blue, red or pearl (NW-E55).https://tweakers.net/nieuws/32857/sony-releast-nw-e55-en- nw-e75-network-walkmans.html The NW-E99 and NW-E95 were introduced in October 2004, with 1 GB and 512 MB internal memory respectively. They had native MP3 support.https://www.engadget.com/2004-10-25-sonys-new-network-walkman- nw-e99-and-nw-e95-rock-mp3.html E100 Series The NW-E100 series was released in March 2005 which has a circular design.

Sony also claimed it has a \\"superquick battery charge\\" giving 3 hours of battery life by charging for 3 minutes.https://www.cnet.com/reviews/sony-network-walkman-nw-e400-review/ This feature was carried over to various other Walkman players afterwards. Models were: NW-E507/E407 (1 gigabyte), NW-E505/E405 (512 MB), NW-E503/E403 (256 MB). E300/E200 Series (Bean) The \\"Walkman Bean\\" model was released in late 2005.https://www.engadget.com/2005-08-18-sonys-walkman-bean.html E000 Series In August 2006 Sony released the NW-E00X series, filled with 512MB, 1 GB or 2 GB of flash-memory.

This series also worked with Linux and Mac using the free software originally called NW-E00X MP3 File Manager, that eventually become in Symphonic, and now JSymphonic. JSymphonic is an open source, cross-platform program (that runs on any Windows/Linux/Mac machine with java 1.5 installed), that, once copied into the Walkman enables the transfer of several audio files, including MP3, to/from several flash based Walkman Series. It can be downloaded from here and is in continuous development. E010 Series NW-E013 (2007) In March 2007, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, some countries of Europe and Canada had the Walkman NW-E01X series (NW-E013, NW-E015 and NW-E016) a small USB flash player.

However, they struggled losing 14 of their next 18 games. The Pacers played around .500 for the remainder of the season, finishing fourth in the Central Division with a 42–40 record, and entering the playoffs as the #8 seed in the Eastern Conference.

In 2012–13 the club played in the 2. Bundesliga, the second tier of German football. It was the club's first season back in this league, having won promotion from the 3. Liga in 2011–12 after a play-off victory over Karlsruher SC. The club also took part in the 2012–13 edition of the DFB- Pokal, the German Cup, but was knocked out by Bundesliga side FC Bayern Munich in the first round. ==Review and events== After a string of losses, manager Oscar Corrochano was suspended on 4 November 2012 and sporting director Franz Gerber took over until the end of 2012. On 2 January 2013, Franciszek Smuda was announced as new manager. His contract ran until the end of the 2012–13 and would have been automatically extended for another season if Regensburg avoided relegation. But Regensburg's relegation was clear on matchday 31 and Smuda said that he would not coach in the 3. Liga. ==MatchesLegend=Friendly matches=2.

The Impreza received naturally aspirated 1.5, 1.6, 2.0, or 2.5 liter flat-four engines, with the performance oriented WRX and WRX STI models upgraded to turbocharged versions of the two latter options. Export models typically received all-wheel drive, with front- wheel drive also available in the Japanese domestic market. == History  Pre-facelift: 2000–2002 === Built on a significantly modified version of the first generation platform, the new Impreza followed much the same formula as its predecessor, including a similarly contoured silhouette. Despite this, the front-end styling—distinguished by ovoid headlamps—attracted significant controversy. This version of the Impreza has gained the nickname 'Bug Eye' among Subaru enthusiasts. Body dimensions for the sedan increased by in length, in width, and in height; wheelbase increased by . To satisfy Japanese vehicle size tax regulations, the width of the hatchback increased by just to and therefore remaining in the limit \\"5\\" classification. As Subaru had intended to homologate the sedan chassis for rallying, the decision to increase the width of the sedan—which placed it into the higher taxed number \\"3\\" division—brought added stability. Likewise, the increase in track for the sedan also worked to aid handling, with the hatchback gaining just . Other main improvements to the chassis included a 120 percent increase in torsional rigidity; mainly due to revisions in front subframe design. The suspension retained its basic MacPherson strut in the front and rear, although Subaru altered the geometry. The GD chassis gains nearly in weight over the GC chassis. Subaru claims that compared to the previous model, the GD chassis is 148 percent and 82 percent stiffer in torsional and beam rigidity, respectively. This stiffness is primarily due to the addition of a steel \\"ring\\" which encircles the cabin at the B-pillar. While the stiffness was increased for passenger safety, it has the added benefit of providing more stability for motorsports events. Firehouse magazine notes that the Jaws of Life need to cut the Subaru's B-pillars at certain points in order to cut through the car frame. In terms of safety, the GD chassis scored much higher than the GC chassis and earned a \\"Good\\" rating (highest mark) from the IIHS's offset crash test. 4 stars front driver, 5-star front passenger and 4-star side safety ratings from the NHTSA. In Subaru's home market of Japan, the Impreza range started with the 1.5i—powered by the 1.5-liter EJ15 SOHC engine and paired with a manual transmission or optional automatic. Subaru fitted a DOHC version of the same engine to the automatic-only 1.5R, which also featured an active valve control system. For both models, front- and all-wheel drive versions were available. Starting from 2006, Subaru phased out the EJ15 engine in favour of the new EL15. Subaru released this generation of Impreza to North America in 2001 for the 2002 model year. The release of the 2.0-liter turbocharged Impreza WRX, did not occur until the 2002 model year, and the Impreza WRX STI was delayed until the 2004 model year. The US version of the STI includes various departures from the Japanese and European counterparts, such as a turbocharged 2.5-liter EJ257 engine, rather than the twin scroll turbo 2.0 L engine sold elsewhere. All 2006 American Imprezas use some form of the 2.5-liter EJ25 engine since naturally aspirated and turbocharged are available. The Outback Sport was sold in Australia for model years 2001–2007, but it was renamed as the Impreza RV with the same color scheme as the American version. The Australian version had a dual-range manual transmission, not available in the United States. The Impreza was Wheels magazine's Car of the Year for 2000.

For the US market, the facelifted Impreza was offered as 2.5 RS Sedan and TS Wagon, 2.5 Outback Sport Wagon, WRX Sedan and Wagon, and the new WRX STI Sedan. Sport Package was optional for the RS, and the WRX could be ordered with Premium Package. The RS, TS, Outback Sport, and WRX are available with manual or automatic transmission, while the sole transmission for the STI is 6-speed manual. This version of the Impreza has gained the nickname 'Blob Eye' among Subaru enthusiasts. In 2005, Subaru made their AVCS standard on all engines used in the Impreza.

Greek designer Andreas Zapatinas, formerly of Alfa Romeo, penned the updated front-end in 2004. The facelift introduced Subaru's new corporate face, including its controversial \\"jet intake and wings\\" grille design that first appeared on the Subaru R2 kei car. The new corporate face was designed to pay homage to their aircraft manufacturing roots, the Nakajima Aircraft Company. This version of the Impreza has gained the nickname 'Hawk Eye' among Subaru enthusiasts.

The GDA WRX model also retained the 5-speed manual transmission gearbox design from the GC8. Subaru later released a new 6-speed gearbox for the STi model GDB that is significantly stronger. The GD chassis, along with the WRX and STI, underwent two styling changes in its life cycle. The original styling applied to A and B. Initially this design proved to be rather unpopular which prompted a more conventional design for the applied C, D and E models. The second facelift applied to the F and G versions. The WRX STi gained 17\\" x 7.5\\" alloy wheels over the previous 16\\" x 7\\" wheels, and the 5 speed manual transmission (reputed to be one of the car's weak points) was changed to an STi-engineered 6 speed manual transmission. The engine, retained from the Version 6 STi, still retains the semi-closed deck block and is still labelled as the EJ207. However the engines did gain AVCS, further improving their low-end torque production. The interior was updated with an STi logo on the gauge and the tachometer also has a red shift light. Brembo 4 piston front and 2 piston rear brakes came standard on the STi and were an option on the bare-bones Type RA STi, which still carried the Subaru 4 piston front/2 piston rear brakes as standard. Externally, the STi has a larger hood scoop and has foglight covers with the STi logo embossed on them. The DCCD was updated to work with anti-lock brakes. During braking, when the ABS is on, the DCCD will set itself to open-mode (no locking). The version nomenclature was dropped from the name. Japanese and other auto-enthusiasts often refer to the chassis as GDB/GDF (the STi has a 'B' or 'F' (for USDM models) whereas the regular WRX had an 'A'). The fourth character of the VIN gives the revision (A to F where G is the 2007 version). In 2000, most of Asia, Oceania and Europe received the new STi. The engine was detuned to meet emission standards. Engine output was variously rated from at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm, to at 6,400 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm depending on the market. 2005 STis received the long-awaited DCCD control available in other markets, as well as a slight wheelbase increase to match the Japanese- spec WRX STi Spec-C and has . === Japan === ;Applied A (2000) August 2000 brings the 2001 WRX NB sedan. It is powered by an EJ205 with AVCS coupled with an IHI TD04-HL turbocharger. The engine produces at 6,000 rpm with 35 kg·m (246 ft·lbf, 333 N·m) at 3,600 rpm. The wheels are in diameter. The car uses 2 pot/1 pot front and rear brakes. The front brake rotors are ventilated while there are rear solid disks. It has a Torsen rear LSD and a 4.44 final drive ratio. The transmission has close-ratio gears unique to Subaru of Japan at that point in time. The car has a curb weight of . Aside from the WRX Type RA STi, the Sports Wagon STi also returned from the previous model, although it retained the 4 pot/2 pot Subaru calipers from the preceding STi while using narrower 17\\" wheels from the Legacy. Similar to the GDB, The foglight covers featured a white STi logo on them. The WRX Type RA STi was used for Group N homologation. ;Applied B (2001) The 2002MY WRX NB sedan debuts on September 2001. The mechanical specifications are similar to the previous year's model but the curb weight has been increased to . Along with the rest of the Impreza line, the grille and body of the WRX STi was lightly updated by Peter Stevens to give it a more angular look when seen from the side. The color of the STi logo on the foglights was changed to pink. Aside from minor suspension improvements and a small increase in torque output, virtually everything remained unchanged. The Type RA was replaced by the WRX STi Spec C. This model was much lighter than the Type RA as it received lighter glass and body panels. The Spec C's handling was much improved due to an increase in caster (from 3.5 degrees to 5 degrees). This was achieved not by changing the suspension mounting point, but by lengthening the wheelbase by . This was done by including different control arms. This increased caster significantly helped the turn-in capabilities of the car. The Spec C also has a steering rack ratio of 13:1. The transmission is supplied with its own oil cooler. The Sports Wagon STi had ceased production by this time. ;Applied C (2002) The WRX NB-R sedan is released in November 2002. The power and torque ratings are the same as the previous year. The wheel diameters are increased to 17\\" in size. The rear brake rotor is changed to a ventilated disk, leaving the car to use only ventilated disks for braking. The car has 4 pot/2 pot front and rear brakes. The rear wing is on wing risers. The car now weighs . The WRX STi was used for Group N homologation. ;Applied D (2003) The WRX line receives a body exterior update and an improved transmission. The WRX STi is now capable of being ordered with DCCD. The WRX STi Spec C Type RA was released. It sported a carbon-fiber wing and a carbon fiber lip. It also had a new set of BBS wheels as well as a newly tuned engine. The WRX STi V-Limited was released. It sports 4-way dampers tuned by Subaru World Rally Team's Group N driver Toshi Arai. The WRX STi was used for Group N homologation. ;Applied E (2004) The WRX WR- limited is introduced. The car receives an STI spoiler and an STI front chin. There is a WR-stickered titanium shift knob. The wheels are changed for STI, gold-colored Rays-sourced wheels. This was the first Impreza STi model to be offered in the United States. Subaru unveiled this model at the Detroit International Auto Show, only 1 month after Mitsubishi announced the arrival of the 271 horsepower Lancer Evolution 8, which out-performed the 2.0L WRX. ;Applied F (2005) The WRX has an option to receive the same spoiler as the WRX STI. The WRX has a viscous rear LSD now. The WRX STi receives the same increase in wheelbase as the Spec C. All STis received additional rear arch flaring in order to allow an increase in wheel size. The wheel size changed from 17\\" x 7.5\\" to 17\\" x 8\\". In accordance with the increased wheel width, steering lock-to-lock turns have been reduced. Wheel hub strength was improved. The P.C.D. was changed from 5 x 100 mm to 5 x 114.3 mm. The interior was vastly improved as well. A whole new center console now brings out a very high grade interior feel. The WRX STI Spec C's receives the Arai tuned dampers and a swaybar. The rear suspension is changed from rubber bushings to pillowball bushings. The strut tower was further stiffened for improved handling and stability. The strut towers were reinforced for better handling and better ride characteristics. The engine mounts were changed from metal to liquid-filled plastic mounts to reduce vibrations into the car's cabin. Some 2006 owners have had issues with these plastic engine mounts. The manufacturer will replace them, under warranty if broken, with the 2005 rubber mounts. The DCCD is updated with the use of a torque-sensing mechanism inside the DCCD. The torque split is changed to 41/59. The WRX STI Spec C was used for Group N homologation. Subaru Impreza WRX STI Spec.C Type RA-R The WRX STI Spec C Type RA was released in November 2005, with 350 units produced. The Type RA added the following to the Spec C model from the STI parts catalogue: 4-way STI adjustable inverted struts, STI Japan-spec pink springs, STI rear lateral links, STI rear trailing links, STI rear sway bar, STI rear pillowball suspension, STI opening rear axleback exhaust, STI 17\\" x 8\\" Enkei-made wheels and STI V-lip front spoiler. ;Applied G (2007) The car is mechanically the same as the previous Japan-spec revision. For the STI, changes include a different turbocharger VF43 equipped with a slightly larger wastegate port to prevent boost creep (VF43, as opposed to VF39 in the older version) and revised gearing on the 6-speed manual transmission. They also use top feed injectors instead of side feed injectors like the previous STi models (04-06USDM). This means the intake manifold is a bit different as well as the TVG (Tumble Valve Generators) used for emissions on cold start-ups. ; _Special Editions (STI)_ ;S202 STi This car is an S-series Impreza based on the featherweight Type RA Spec C, where RA stands for “Record Attempt.” It's rather special and still considered the most radical and extreme factory-built STi (Subaru Tecnica International) to date. Apparently, Petter Solberg, Subaru driver and winner of Rally GB at that time, reckons that of all the roadgoing Imprezas he's driven, the S202 feels most like his WRC car. All of the suspension and powertrain parts included STi parts from the STi part catalogue. The interior included special edition STi seats with red STi logo stitching. A smaller, lightweight air-cond compressor was fitted to save weight. The S202 had a production run of 400 units for the Japanese domestic market and was sold-out in a mere two weeks. Individually numbered badges for each car is located under the ashtray. Even when the S202 was sold with electric windows and air-cond intact, the car weighed a full less than the stock STi at (fairly lightweight considering this is a car with an AWD layout) and put out 316 bhp (320 hp). No thick heavy carpets, lightweight aluminum hood, thinner door skins and cards, thinner glass windows, special fitted lightweight STi parts to replace the lower arms and a lightweight alternator. Unique to the S202 are the pink STi lateral links. The brake rotors were gas slotted. The steering rack was swapped out to one with an uprated ratio. With the S202 STi model, they also re-did some of the internals too. Molybdenum coated pistons were used to lower friction together with hollow intake valves. The AWD-system consists of a Suretrac diff upfront and mechanical diff at the rear. The wheels were STi labeled Rays Volk alloys. The exterior featured an adjustable carbon-fiber GT-style wing at the back (of which only 400 were produced) and a manually operated roof vent – rally car style. Less known to the non S-Series enthusiasts, the S202 came with many other rally-use parts such as steel braided brake lines, 12 liter intercooler tank at the back, and an additional anti-surge fuel tank to name a few. The later S models specifically the S203 and S204 were heavier as they were not based on the Spec C chassis, whilst the S202 emphasized on reducing weight as it was based on the Type RA Spec C. Strictly based on specs, the S202 was the first radical Type RA Spec C. The other model that was produced later based on the Spec C was the Spec C Type RA-R. Of late, the rare S202 has become a collectors' car especially among enthusiasts. ;S203 This limited edition Subaru was an S-series Impreza based on the WRX STi. Again it is basically a car with all the STi parts available. It was sold with custom-made BBS alloys with Pirelli tyres. ;S204 The new S204 was released at the end of 2005. It is based on the WRX STi and similar to the S203. It does away with the roof spoiler and has a different grille from the rest of the Impreza line. The S204 has a two-liter (EJ20) H4 engine capable of developing 324 PS (239 kW; 320 bhp) and a six- speed manual gearbox. When cruising the S204 achieves at 3,000 rpm in top gear and can reach at approximately 6,600 rpm. Suspension can be described as 'stiff' with torsional rigidity enhanced by the inclusion of laterally mounted items described as \\"performance dampers\\" bearing both the STi logo and Yamaha. As a result, cornering can be described as excellent. The addition of a carbon fiber front-lip spoiler and a rear diffuser on an already low suspension setup plus the use of low-profile Pirelli P Zero (Corsa) tires implies the S204 is intended mostly for sealed road use. Recaro has used carbon fibre extensively in the manufacture of the driver and front passenger seats available in the S204. The high side bolsters provide significant support to the driver during maneuvers that induce lateral forces and are considered to be an integral feature to the cornering performance of this vehicle. The seats are rigid in design and have relatively little cushioning compared to other Impreza models. Advertising material produced by Subaru for the S204 indicate that a limited run of 600 S204's were made. Individually numbered badges for each car are located within the engine bay and repeated as a small plaque situated at the base of the gear lever. However, five (5) WRX STI S204 were made available to Subaru enthusiasts in New Zealand. Unlike other S204s sent to other nations (for example 30 units for Singapore) these five cars do not display either the in-cabin or in-engine bay badging that uniquely identifies each of the reported 600 vehicles manufactured. The lack of individual badging for these five cars brings into question the real number of S204s manufactured. ;WRX STI Spec C Type RA-R At the end of October, 300 2007MY WRX STI Spec C Type RA-Rs were open for ordering. These cars are based on the WRX STI Spec C. The wheels are changed for , STI-branded, Enkei-made, white wheels. The engine has been blueprinted and balanced. It produces of power. The suspension is built with the latest STI parts from the STI catalogue. The front brakes are 6-piston Brembo brakes. The turbocharger is based on the larger S203/S204 twin scroll unit. The brakes are made so that they change from silver to gold when heated from usage. The rotors are slotted. The 2nd R in \\"RA-R\\" is stated by an STI engineer to mean \\"radical\\". ;WRX STI A-Line This WRX STI A-Line is mechanically the same as the Japan-spec STI. The exterior has been toned down with the removal of large rear spoiler, black Brembo brakes, titanium colored Enkei wheels, a black STI front lip and leather seats in order to target the more mature market. === Australia === ;Rev. A (2001) The WRX has an EJ205 rated at at 6,000 rpm. It carries 17\\" x 7\\" wheels and has 4-piston/2-piston front and rear brakes with ventilated disk rotors all around. ;Rev. B (2002) Due to complaints of slower acceleration in comparison to the GC-chassis WRX, the gear ratios and diff ratio are changed to the same specifications as the Japanese domestic market WRX to improve overtaking and in gear acceleration. The result is near identical first and second gear ratios to the GC, but with a noticeably shorter third, fourth and fifth gear. Also added was a Suretrac limited slip rear differential. Japanese engineers claimed that drive would still be directed to the gripping wheel even if the other wheel was off the ground. ;Rev. D (2004) The WRX received the same Peter Stevens-designed facelift that rest of the Imprezas received. During 2005 a limited edition Subaru Impreza WRX WRP10 was produced, but limited to 200 vehicles. The Australian market models received an engine upgrade to and of torque via a compression ratio increase to 9.0:1 and the addition of variable valve timing on the intake camshafts. The Subaru Impreza WRX WRP10 (2005) is a limited edition version of the Impreza WRX exclusive to the Australian market. The WRP10 was available from late January 2005 and was limited to 200 units, featuring individually numbered badges. It includes enhancements to the wheels, tires, suspension, engine, and exhaust over a standard WRX. The 'WR' stands for 'World Rally', the 'P' for Subaru's partnership with Pirelli tires, and the '10' indicates the 10th anniversary of this partnership. STi carbon fiber engine bay strut brace and WRX suspension lowering kit with STi springs drop the car's ride height by . Together, the STi sports parts increase rigidity for improved ride and handling; giving the WRP10 a more aggressive stance. WRP10 includes an STI replacement Electronic Control Unit increasing peak power from standard WRX's at 6,000 rpm to at 6,000 rpm. Torque is increased by to at 4,000 rpm. Be aware that the WRP10's STi tuned ECU is not flash-tune compatible as it's been locked by STi. === Europe === The Prodrive Performance Pack (PPP) is an official accessory for UK GD-chassis WRXs. It evolved from the WR Sport pack fitted to some RB5s. The 2007 version costs £1700 including VAT and fitting, raising power output from to and torque to . ;Rev. A (2001) The WRX is powered by an EJ205 rated at at 6,000 rpm. It features 17\\" x 7\\" wheels and has 4-piston/2-piston front and rear brakes. ;Rev. B (2002) Due to complaints of the slower acceleration of the GD-chassis WRX compared to the GC-chassis WRX, the gear ratios are changed to the same specifications as the Japanese-spec WRX to improve acceleration. ;Rev. D (2004) The WRX received the same Peter Stevens-designed facelift that rest of the Imprezas received. The engine powerplant was improved to produce . Some cost reductions were made, such as downgrading the stereo. ;Rev. F (2006) 2006: Europe receives WRXs with the EJ25. The power output is at 5,600 rpm with 32.6 kg·m (236 ft·lbf, 320 N·m) of torque at 3,600 rpm. The car weighs . The final drive ratio on this car is 4.111:1. The car also received the same facelift as the other markets. === North America === ;Applied A (2000) WRX's initial release date 2000. ;Applied B (2001) North America receives its first Impreza WRX models. They are equipped with an EJ205 engine rated at at 6,000 rpm with of torque at 4,000 rpm. Unlike the Japanese EJ205, the US-spec engine uses a Mitsubishi TD04-13T turbocharger unit. In stock form, it reaches a peak of boost. The seats are the same as the basic J-spec Impreza. The wheels are cast 16\\" x 6.5\\" version of the J-spec WRX NB wheels while the brakes are 2-piston/1-piston front and rear with the front rotors being ventilated disks. 2002 WRXs came with brake duct plates that guided the air in the front bumper vent to the wheel well. The gear ratios are the standard export models, but the final drive is a 3.9:1 ratio. The rear LSD is a viscous coupling type. The steering rack has a ratio of 16.5:1. The 4 gear electronic automatic transmission (4EAT) WRXs have a Variable Torque Distribution AWD system instead of the conventional viscous coupling center differential. VTD employs an electronically controlled hydraulic transfer clutch and a planetary gear center differential to distribute power in a 45:55 split between the front and rear axles under normal circumstances. The VTD system uses multiple sensors to measure front and rear driveshaft speeds, throttle position and gear selection. Then it actively transfers power accordingly between the front and rear wheels for optimum traction and handling. The WRX weighs . ;Applied C (2002–2003) There are few changes from applied B. The gears are changed to RA- width gears (1 mm increase in size) to increase durability of the transmission. There is also a valve that prevents \\"drop-clutch\\" starts in an effort to reduce the number of shattered gear boxes from abusive AWD launching. The ignition ring is now illuminated with green lighting. Early 2002 WRXs had brake duct plates. At the end of calendar year 2002, the brake duct plates were no longer equipped on the WRXs. A shorter metal fuel pipe and longer connector hose were implemented under the intake manifold to avoid fuel leaks at freezing temperatures. ;Applied D (2004) 2004–2005 Subaru Impreza WRX wagon (US) The WRX received the same Peter Stevens-designed facelift that rest of the Imprezas received. The WRX uses the same contoured seats as the 2004 US-spec WRX STI. The WRX is equipped with multi-phase valve struts to improve ride quality while retaining good handling. The tachometer was moved to center, and the speedometer was moved to the right. In 2004, Subaru of America announced it would sell the WRX STi. Subaru Tecnica International's president said in an interview with Road & Track magazine that he wished to beat the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution in the US. Thus, each iteration of the US-spec WRX STi is essentially the same as the respective J-spec STi Spec C. All part numbers matched up, including the part-numbers for the glass windows and dampers. However, instead of the EJ207, the United States receives the first EJ257, a 2.5-liter version of the EJ207. Unlike the EJ207, it features hypereutectic cast pistons. According to Subaru USA, this latest STi piston is a cast aluminum design. However, this is a special hypereutectic material and it has an augmentation of 120% in terms of strength over their previous aluminium pistons.Subaru USA and Canada The steering rack is the standard STi's 15.2:1 instead of the Spec C's 13:1 ;Applied E (2005) The WRX received an updated interior, body color rocker panels, black painted headlamp bezels, and wheels that were previously seen on the base US-spec Legacy and a single- port exhaust. Some WRX models have an STI hood scoop that is much larger than other WRX scoops. The suspension has also received a few small updates to make handling more efficient compared to the 2004 model. Cassette players in the stereo system were no longer offered. 2005 Subaru Impreza WRX STI (note the coloured rocker panels for the 2005 model year) As with the Japanese-spec C models, US-spec STis received additional rear fender flaring in order to allow an increase in wheel size. The wheel size went from 17\\" x 7.5\\" to 17\\" x 8\\". In accordance with the increased wheel width, steering lock-to-lock turns have been reduced. Wheel hub strength was improved. The P.C.D. was changed from 5 x 100 to 5 x 114.3. The Suretrac front LSD in the 2004 model was replaced with a helical unit, the rear differential remains the same clutch type unit. Torque split is set at 35/65. In the interior, the Stereo became standard. The badging has been revised and different look was given to the steering wheel, shift knob, HVAC controls, and center console. ;Applied F (2006) 2006–2007 Subaru WRX sedan (US) 2006–2007 Subaru WRX wagon (US) For 2006 the Subaru Impreza WRX received a complete front-end re-design, restyled headlights with smoke-tinted lenses, a three-section mesh-type grill, and distinguished new tail lamp clusters. Three trims levels are available: WRX TR (Tuner Ready), WRX, and Limited. The car's curb weight is for the WRX TR, for the WRX, and 3240 for the WRX Limited. The biggest change was the 2.5-liter turbocharged intercooled EJ255 engine, producing at 5600 rpm. It replaced the 2.0-liter EJ205 engine used since the WRX model's introduction. The larger-displacement engine produced of peak torque at 3,600 rpm, compared to at 4,000 rpm for the previous WRX. Performance was improved in all speed ranges, with greater emphasis on low-end and mid-range torque. The 2.5-liter WRX engine shared architecture and technology with the WRX STI engine, including Subaru Active Valve Control System (AVCS) variable valve timing and an Electronic Throttle Control system. The turbocharger remained the same unit as on the 2002–2005MY US-spec WRXs, but peaked at of boost. The first gear in the transmission received dual-ring synchros to improve downshifts from 2nd to 1st and reduce notchiness. 2006 Impreza WRX models gained some chassis and braking system enhancements. On sedan models, aluminum front suspension lower A-arms reduced unsprung weight. (The rear suspension gained forward aluminum lateral links in the 2005 model year.) The steering rack was updated for improved steering feel and the steering rack ratio was changed to 15.0:1. On all WRX models, 7-spoke aluminum-alloy wheels replaced the previous 5 spoke wheels. Tires were 215/45ZR17 versus 205/55R16 before. The more powerful brake system employed vented front discs and four-piston calipers instead of the previous versions two-piston calipers. The rear brakes were ventilated discs replacing the previous solid discs, and two-piston calipers replacing single-piston calipers. The calipers are painted red with the SUBARU name in white overlain. The US-spec STIs receive the same facelift as the Japanese-spec STIs. Mechanically speaking, the DCCD (Driver Controlled Center Differential) and the engine mounts have been changed. Like the Japanese-spec STIs engine mounts were changed from metal to liquid-filled plastic mounts to reduce vibrations into the car's cabin. The manufacturer will replace them, under warranty, if broken, with the 2005 rubber and metal mounts. Later 2006 vehicles were equipped from the factory with 2005 mounts. The center differential is updated with the addition of a mechanical limited slip mechanism to supplement the electromagnetic DCCD. The torque split is changed to 41/59. The oil pump within the transmission was also deleted. The 2006 STI weighs approximately . ;Applied G (2007) Ikuo Mori takes the place of Kyoji Takenaka as President and CEO of Fuji Heavy Industries. As a cost-cutting effort, the WRX has its aluminum suspension reverted to steel-cast pieces. The WRX and Limited trim levels receive an auxiliary audio port next to the cigarette lighter and MP3 CD playback. 2007 US-spec Subaru Impreza WRX STi Limited. Only 800 were produced In 2007, quite a number of changes were made to the US-spec STI. Due to Subaru's decision to reduce costs by cutting the amount of aluminum used, the US-spec STI no longer receives the J-spec Spec C control arms. The control arms are now the aluminum ones used on the Japan-spec revision A and B non- Spec C STis. The high caster angle has been reduced, which in turn reduces the wheelbase from to . The rear sway bar has decreased in size from to . The gear ratios of second, third and fourth gears have been made longer (higher ratio) in order to improve fuel economy and drivability, which inadvertently reduces 1/4 mile drag racing times due to the ability to trap in 4th gear, without the shift to 5th. The transmission oil pump that was deleted in the 2006 model year was also brought back for the 07 model year transmission. The EJ257's cylinder heads have been redesigned to improve cooling, and the sodium-filled exhaust valves have been deleted. Pistons are the same as previous years. The alternator is changed from a 90A rating to 110 amps. The rear Limited Slip Differential is now a Torsen unit, considered an upgrade from the previous model's clutch type unit. The turbo has also been changed to the VF43, which has a different wastegate actuator than the VF39. The side cowl braces are stiffer than the 2006MY. The engine mounts are once again the hard rubber mounts used prior to 2006. On the interior, there is an audio jack that replaces the ashtray, a rear center armrest with trunk pass-through and a 120 W audio system. The STI's ECU was completely re-engineered in order to meet US LEV2 emissions requirements, which has caused throttle and timing issues. A secondary air pump was also added to help meet LEV2. Top Feed injectors replaced the Side Feed from the previous models. The WRX STI Limited was introduced with fog lights, leather interior, lip trunk spoiler, and optional moonroof. It is similar to the Japan-spec WRX STI A-line, except the mechanicals of the car are based on the 2007MY US-spec WRX STI. === United Kingdom === 2005 Subaru Impreza WRX (Europe) ;WRX UK300 (2001) Subaru produced 300 examples of the UK300 to celebrate the rallying success in the UK from the previous years. It features Prodrive-OZ-wheels in gold, Pirelli Rosso P Zero Tyres, a blue Alcantara Interior or a blue leather option, UK300 floor mats, UK300 headlights, UK300 exclusive front and rear spoilers and UK300 decals. ;WR1 (2004) A limited edition of 1000 Japanese MY04 WRX STI's with DCCD was exported to celebrate victory in the 2003 WRC drivers' championship. 500 were sold in Europe, Australia and South Africa as the Petter Solberg edition; the other 500 were further modified by Prodrive and sold in the UK as the WR1. They had and , a 0–60 mph (97 km/h) time of 4.25 seconds and a top speed of (electronically limited). They were equipped with Prodrive WRX STI springs, Pirelli PZero Nero tires, mesh grilles, special Ice Blue metallic paint and Prodrive PFF7 Pewter wheels. The new ECU and exhaust were not EU-homologated, so they were fitted after registering the car. ;WRX 300 (2005) 300 vehicles limited to the UK market were sold with Blue Mica exterior paint, 17\\" gold alloy wheels with 215/45 tires, Subaru World Rally Team branded front bucket seats, a 5-speed manual transmission and the Prodrive Performance Package (PPP) all as standard equipment. The Performance Package increased power to and torque and equipped the car with a 0–60 mph (97 km/h) time of 4.8 seconds and a top speed of . 12 months' free subscription to RAC Trackstar was included in the basic on the road price of £21495.00 (approx. $31800). Considering that the total on the road price of the standard non-limited edition Prodrive Performance Pack equipped Impreza WRX was £21900.00, the WRX 300 represented very good value for money. Optional extras included an 18\\" P-FF7 wheel and tire package, a Prodrive brake upgrade (front brakes only), a sports suspension upgrade and a special edition rear spoiler. ;RB320 (2006) Subaru Impreza RB320 In 2006, Subaru UK released the limited edition Subaru Impreza RB320 in honor of the late Richard Burns, who died in 2005 from cancer. Richard won the 2001 WRC Drivers Championship for SWRT. The RB320 was available only in Obsidian Black, and also features bespoke alloy wheels and specially developed Prodrive suspension using Bilstein dampers, a sports spring kit with revised rear anti-roll bar and a ride height lowered by at the front and at the rear. Also standard was a chrome mesh front grille, front lip spoiler, quick shift gearchange, side sill plates and RB320-branded gear knob, carpet mats and exclusive exterior badging. Each owner will also receive an individually numbered black alloy tax disc holder. The Prodrive Performance Pack (PPP) boosts power to at 6,000 rpm and torque to at 3,700 rpm. This reduces the 0–60 mph (97 km/h) time to 4.8 seconds and the 0–100 mph (62 mph) time to 12.2 seconds. ;Spec D (2006) A 'discreet' version of the STI was made for a more conservative market. It is similar to the Japanese-spec A-Line except it had a regular WRX spoiler on the boot, silver wheels (not Gold) and no rear roof vane. As standard, it has projector-style fog lights, Smartnav with touch screen operation, Vehicle Tracker, and safe speed system. A 200W Pioneer DEH-P70BT head unit, iPod adapter and Bluetooth phone connection were also included. The interior featured standard leather trim on the seats and doors, Auto climate control and extra sound insulation. It was limited to a run of 300 cars in only Crystal Grey Metallic so therefore is even rarer than the RB320. Power on this model is rated at . It has a 0–60 mph (97 km/h) time of 5 seconds and a top speed of (electronically limited). New retail price was £28,450. The UK version of the WRX STI ;GB270 (2007) Subaru produced only 400 cars; 300 4dr saloon versions and 100 5dr hatchback models. The GB270 was available in either WR Blue Mica (4dr) or Urban Grey Metallic (5dr). The name was derived from the 2.5-liter turbocharged engine which produced and of torque. These upgrades meant a 0- time of 4.9 seconds and a top speed of . The top speed of the GB270 was slightly lower than that of other Imprezas because it features a Prodrive Quickshift 5-speed gearbox that offered faster gearshifts compared to the standard 6-speed gearbox. Prodrive fitted their upgraded suspension system, lowering height of the car by in the front and in the rear. A Prodrive anti-roll bar, Prodrive polished stainless-steel mesh front grille, a set of bespoke Prodrive alloy wheels – Silver on four door, Black on five door were included in the £22,995 on the road price. ;RB320 (2007) Echoing the RB5, a limited edition of 320 2007MY STI cars in Obsidian Black Pearl were released \\"in memory of Richard Burns\\", the 2001 WRC World Champion, who died in 2005 due to a brain tumor. The car produces and of torque due to tuning by Prodrive. The suspension has been upgraded to Eibach springs, an Eibach rear stabilizer bar and Bilstein struts. It rides on anthracite alloys. A £1500 option on the car was to have the interior changed to a black leather/Alcantara with RB320 stitching on the seat and a new gear (shift) knob. It also has special silver mesh grilles. == Saab 9-2X == Subaru manufactured a badge engineered version of the second generation Impreza hatchback, marketed by Saab as the \\"Saab 9-2X\\" (stylized as 92X) in the North American market for model years, 2005–2006. At the time, Saab Automobile had been a fully owned subsidiary of General Motors (GM), and GM held a 20 percent stake of Subaru's parent company, Fuji Heavy Industries. Saab redesigned the front- and rear styling to integrate the car with the brand design language. Revisions included modified front fascia, fenders, hood, tailgate and rear fascia. The interior received extra acoustic insulation over the Subaru, with particular attention paid to the firewall, carpeting, roof, and rear window seals. The majority of the interior of the 9-2X is identical to the Impreza wagon. Saab offered a 2-tone seat design based on the earlier second gen Impreza wagon, as well as use the instrument cluster from the earlier second gen Impreza. 2005 was the first year all wheel drive was offered by Saab. All wheel drive was standard on both the 9-2X and the 9-7X. Saab also specified their own front seats incorporate active head restraints, unlike the fixed headrest seats in the equivalent Impreza WRX. The rear suspension arms are aluminum, with further reduction of unsprung weight achieved by using plastic in place of heavier components, bushings unique to the Saab, and recalibrated dampers. The steering had been made more responsive and exact in the Aero by using the steering rack shared by the STI version of the WRX, which features a faster 15.0:1 steering ratio, more rigidly mounted steering hardware and stiffer chassis bushings. The 9-2X is not particularly popular with Saab brand loyalists for the fact that the changes from the Subaru are mostly cosmetic. The 9-2X also won the highest IIHS safety awards. In October 2005, however, GM decided that it would sell 8.4 percent of the company to Toyota and dispose of its remaining 11.4 percent share back to Fuji in a share buyback deal. The 9-2X was discontinued after the 2006 model year with the dissolution of the partnership between Fuji and GM. 10,346 Saab 9-2Xs were manufactured during the production run, with 8,514 for 2005 and 1,832 for the 2006 model year. Saab offered the 2005 model year 9-2X with Subaru's naturally aspirated 2.5-liter EJ253 engine in the \\"Linear\\" trim level ( and ), with the turbocharged 2.0-liter engine shared with the Impreza WRX offered in the \\"Aero\\" badged model ( and ). All-wheel drive came standard with an optional four-speed automatic transmission available instead of the five-speed manual for both trims. For 2005, Saab offered three options packages. The premium package added leather upholstery and for the US model, xenon HID headlamps. When ordered on with the \\"Linear\\" trim, the premium package also included the in-dash six-CD changer, front fog lamps, vinyl door cards, and a leather- wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. The cold weather package added heated front seats, side view mirror defoggers, and front/rear wiper defrosters where the wipers park. In Canada, cars equipped with the cold package also included an engine block heater. The sport package added a sunroof, and for the \\"Aero\\" only, included 17-inch wheels. ;2006 model year Updates for the 2006 model year included the re-branding of the \\"Linear\\" to \\"2.5i\\", with its 2.5-liter engine upgraded to and . The Aero's 2.0-liter turbocharged engine made way for the higher-displacement 2.5-liter EJ255 turbocharged unit, increasing outputs to and . For 2006, the cars had different options packages that essentially broke down the same equipment differently. The premium package became known as the leather package and incorporated the same additions as previously. The cold weather package also remained unchanged. However, the sport package, with its upgraded 17-inch wheel upgrade package, became exclusive to the Aero as the sunroof became a standalone option. == References == Impreza (second generation) Category:Cars introduced in 2000 Category:Cars powered by boxer engines ","title":"Subaru Impreza (second generation)"},{"id":"35953238","text":"Seqaya () is a suburb located in the Kingdom of Bahrain.

He was best known for his recitations. == Early life == Stephenson was born on Waterloo Day, 18 June 1829 in mid-Atlantic. He started work at Sowerby’s Glass Works, manufacturers of fine decorative glass items, at Gateshead and later moved on to a responsible post as representative for John Rogerson and Co. (who it is believed were brokers and shipping agents) He was a founder member of the Bewick Club and held the post of honorary treasurer in the 1890s. He was an active member speaking at meetings, his humour mimicry and use of the local dialects of Tyneside, Wearside, Teesside and Northumberland made him very popular and in great demand. Some of his racy pieces also went down well on Tyneside. He was also a notable artist and he entered many of his paintings in the Club’s annual exhibitions. These paintings were water colours and covered most aspects of rural life, including local scenes, farmhouses, half-ruined cottages, etc., and urban life in the form of scenes of Old Newcastle, many just before their demolition/removal. ==Family== His father, also John Stephenson, was well known locally holding a responsible job as a superintendent in the Tyneside chemical industry. He was on his way to take up his post with the East India Company in India when his son was born, in mid- Atlantic ocean, hence his middle name. His mother Elizabeth (1804–1878), was a daughter of Elizabeth (née Goirdon) and Dr William Brummell, who was featured in several songs, in one William Purvis (Blind Willie) would sing of him and he is mentioned in William Oliver’s \\"The Newcassel Props\\". They travelled to India in the brig \\"Argo\\" and whilst in India at least three other children, Catherine Mary Layton (born c1836), Henry, and Indiana (sometimes referred to as Julianna – maybe at some stage it was transcribed wrongly), were born. The family stayed in India for a period of 12 years before returning to Tyneside, and a further three further children were born after the family returned from India, Leonard, Albert and Alfred. In the 1841 census, the family were living at Peak Hill (now Ravenscar), Stainton Dale, North Riding of Yorkshire where father was described as an agent for Peek Alum Works. The 1851 census shows them living at Gateshead with mother as a widow (the father died before Catherine’s wedding in 1860), and according to the 1861 survey, they were living at 11b Elswick East Terrace, Elswick, with mother and just three children, John Atlantic having moved out by now. ===Paintings=== * The Dolphin House, Newcastle * Houses in Silver Street, Newcastle ===Poems and songs=== * \\"Adam and Eve\\" - A Wearside story * \\"Hawks's Men at the Battle of Waterloo\\" * \\"The Postponed Goose\\" – A Wearside tale * \\"A recollection of Ned Corvan\\" * \\"A Tow for nowt\\" – A Tyneside story – A recitation – about a keelman who wanted a free tow from Jarrow to the \\"Mushroom\\" jetty == See also == *Geordie dialect words *Thomas Allan *Allan's Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings ==ReferencesExternal links== * Bards of Newcastle * Wor Geordie songwriters * Allan’s Illustrated Edition of Tyneside songs and readings * Sowerby - Glass & Crystal * Peek Alum Works photo gallery Category:English male poets Category:English songwriters Category:People from Newcastle upon Tyne (district) Category:Year of death missing Category:20th-century deaths Category:1829 births Category:Geordie songwriters Category:English male writers ","title":"John Atlantic Stephenson"},{"id":"35953394","text":"Tony LeonDre Wroten Jr. (born April 13, 1993) is an American professional basketball player who most recently competed for Joventut Badalona of the Liga ACB.

He converted his county to Calvinism and was an influential politician in the service to the Electoral Palatinate. == Life == He was the sixth child of William I, Count of Sayn-Wittgenstein (24 August 1488 - 18 April 1570) and his wife, Johannetta of Isenburg-Neumagen (born 1500). He received his first schooling at Wittgenstein Castle from the vicar of Weidenhausen. In 1543, Louis and his brothers went to Cologne to receive further education. He learned Greek and Latin, as well as English, French, Italian, and some Spanish. From 1545, Louis and two of his brothers studied at the Universities of Leuven, Paris and Orléans. Between 1553 and 1556, he made a Grand Tour, visiting Padua, Malta, Savoy, France and England. he briefly served Pope Pius IV as treasurer. When he returned to Wittgenstein Castle in 1556, Louis found that his father had issued a moderate Lutheran Church Order (Lutheran). He studied the new faith and converted to Lutheranism. His elderly father William I (died 18 April 1570) had appointed Louis' elder brother William II as Regent in 1551. In 1558, William II died in Brussels and Louis I took up the regency. Count Louis was raised in a humanist fashion. He frequently corresponded with his contemporaries, especially with other Calvinists. He travelled to the Netherlands and visited the grave of Erasmus. He began an intensive correspondence with various scholars of his time. As a result of this correspondence, he increasingly turned to the Reformed doctrine. In 1568, he travelled to Zurich, where he met numerous leading Reformed, with whom he also started an intense correspondence. Between 1574 and 1577, he served as Lord High Stewart at the Reformed court of Elector Palatine Frederick III in Heidelberg. During this period, he carried out numerous political tasks. In Heidelberg, he also came into close contact with Reformed theologicians and scholars. After the Palatinate reverted to Lutheranism under Elector Louis VI, his service in Heidelberg ended. Louis returned to his county and brought the reformer Caspar Olevian with him. Reformed church orders had been issued in 1563 and 1565; in 1578, the conversion to the Reformed faith was made official and altars and religious imagery were banned. Louis of Wittgenstein was a very close friend of his neighbour, Count John VI of Nassauburg, who was also reformed, and was almost the same age. In 1584, the two counts jointly founded Herborn Academy. From 1592 to 1594, he again served as Lord High Steward in the Electoral Palatinate, after the Palatinate had again converted to Calvinism. Parts of his extensive diaries have preserved in the Princely Archive in Berleburg. Some excerpts were printed in the 19th Century. His diaries are an important source of information about the intellectual and political history of his time. His extensive correspondence has not yet been fully evaluated by historians. == Family and children == On 14 August 1559, he married Countess Anna of Solms-Braunfels (1538–1565) at Dillenburg Castle. The couple moved their residence from the ancestral Wittgenstein Castle on a hilltop overlooking Bad Laasphe to a former hunting lodge near Berleburg. Here he began keeping a diary. Anna died in 1565. In 1567, Louis remarried, to Countess Elisabeth of Solms-Laubach (6 March 1549 - 1599), daughter of Frederick Magnus I, Count of Solms-Laubach. Children of his first marriage were: * Johannette (15 February 1561 - 13 April 1622), married Johann VI, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg; she was his third wife. * Juliana (18 September 1562 - 13 January 1563). * George II (30 April 1565 - 16 December 1631), inherited Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, married Elisabeth of Nassau-Weilburg (with whom he had issue, Christian Louis Casimir of Sayn-Wittgenstein- Ludwigsburg being among his descendants) and secondly Maria Anna Juliana of Nassau-Dillenburg, daughter of George, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg.

Mikko introduced Timo to Erno Korpelainen, who was chosen to handle most of the recording, mixing and mastering of the album. The recording of \\"United Earth\\" began with drums at Studio Musica in June 2009. Soon after the guitars were recorded at the home studio of Erno, followed vocals. Johanna Vakkuri (ex-Ensiferum) lent her voice to Suzana, a female character in the story. The recordings were followed by several months of mixing and mastering. \\"United Earth\\" was released on 30 October 2010. While received with some publicity, it suffered from lack of promotion.

He was a cousin of John Adams. ==Biography== He was the grandson of Peter Tufts, who emigrated to Massachusetts in 1637. Cotton graduated from Harvard in 1749, studied medicine, and settled at Weymouth. He was one of the original members of the Massachusetts Medical Society, its president 1787-1795, and one of the founders of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780. In 1765 he wrote spirited and patriotic instructions to the representatives of Weymouth against the Stamp Act. He was a representative of the state and a councillor, for many years an active member of the state senate, and supported in the convention the adoption of the U.S. Constitution. ==Legacy== On April 19, 1775, British forces were returning to Boston from the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the opening engagements of the war. On their march they were continually shot at by colonial militiamen. Dr. Cotton Tufts saved the life of Samuel Whittemore who at the time was 80 years old and fought against the British in what is now Arlington, Massachusetts on April 19, 1775.Fischer, David Hackett. Paul Revere's Ride, p. 257, New York and Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1994. . Whittemore was in his fields when he spotted an approaching British relief brigade under Earl Percy, sent to assist the retreat. Whittemore loaded his musket and ambushed the British from behind a nearby stone wall, killing one soldier. He then drew his dueling pistols and killed a grenadier and mortally wounded a second. By the time Whittemore had fired his third shot, a British detachment reached his position; Whittemore drew his sword and attacked. He was shot in the face, bayoneted thirteen times, and left for dead in a pool of blood in Menotomy (present-day Arlington). He was found alive, trying to load his musket to fight again. He was taken to Dr. Cotton Tufts of Medford, who perceived no hope for his survival. However, Whittemore lived another 18 years until dying of natural causes at the age of 98.Fischer, David Hackett.

His thesis film, Espacios won the National Award for Short Films from the Peruvian government in 1997. He also wrote a theatrical piece Mr. Clouds in 2000, which the National Theater of Peru considered among the best of the year and published it in the compilation Dramaturgia Nacional 2000. In the following years, Fuentes-León worked as the lead writer for reality TV shows at the Telemundo in the U.S., subtitled films from major Hollywood studios into Spanish, and worked as an editor of commercials and TV shows, including Rachael Ray's Tasty Travels for the Food Network, while focusing on his own writing and directing projects. His second short Géminis premiered at Outfest in 2004 and screened at various international film festivals. Currently, Fuentes-León is developing various projects including The Woman Who Feared the Sun (based on his play Mr. Clouds) and Sinister, a rock musical set in a restrictive society of the near future, for which Fuentes-León is writing the music as well.Film Independent \\"Talent Guide\\" - Javier Fuentes-León ==Filmography== ;Director *1997: Espacios (short) *2004: Géminis (short) *2009: Undertow (Spanish title Contracorriente) *2014: El Elefante Desaparecido ;Producer *2004: Géminis (short) *2009: Undertow ;Screenwriter *1997: Espacios (short) *2004: Géminis (short) *2009: Undertow *2017: Avenida Larco ;Editor *1997: Espacios (short) *2004: Géminis (short) *2005: Un dia en la vida (short) *2008: Rachael Ray's Tasty Travels (TV series documentary) (episode: \\"Martha's Vineyard\\") ;Actor *2004: Géminis as Géminis (short) *2006: I Heart as Karoke Buddy (short) ;Others *2007: Spine Tingler!

After some difficulties, the involved scientists began to use statistical models to estimate the probabilities of particular events, a rather subjective method, but suitable to build up experience-based expertise (including local knowledge and experience) step by step.Amy Donovan, Clive Oppenheimer, Michael Bravo. Social studies of volcanology: knowledge generation and expert advice on active volcanoes. Bulletin of Volcanology, Springer Verlag (Germany), 2012, 74 (3), pp.677-689. insu-00691620 A 2012 study about knowledge generation and expert advice on active volcanoes used the Montserrat eruption as a showcase, but included as well interviews with scientists in the United Kingdom, Montserrat, Italy and Iceland during fieldwork seasons. It listed the Montserrat case among other recent and historical eruptions that had an influence on volcanology as a science. ==Online sites== Weekly reports of volcanic activity are posted on the official website (http://www.mvo.ms/); MVO also maintains Facebook and Twitter pages.

The United States Forest Service granted the Western Montana Council of the BSA permission to build a summer camp, originally with six small 12x24' clapboard structures and tents on just , in 1924. The camp was expanded beginning in October 1939, with more facilities constructed by the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The camp was completed in 1940 on under the supervision of Forest Service engineer Clyde Fickes. ==Background== There are twenty buildings constructed out of notched Western Larch logs: a dining hall, 15 sleeping cabins, two bathhouses, and caretaker facilities. Uncut native stone was used for the fireplaces. The camp was ready for the summer season in 1940. However, about 1941–1942 The Boy Scouts moved their camp to Melita Island on Flathead Lake. The site was used by the United States Forest Service as a smokejumper school for conscientious objectors in the Civilian Public Service Program during World War II. This smokejumper program operated from May 1943 to April 1946 under the name \\"CPS Camp No. 103\\". It is the only CCC- constructed youth camp in Montana. Campfire Girls, Girl Scouts, Jaycees, 4-H, the Seventh Day Adventist Church, and various civic and religious organizations have used the camp.

It is named after João Havelange, the former President of FIFA and the Brazilian Football Confederation. The centre was the idea of long-time Trinidadian MP and CONCACAF President (1990–2011) Jack Warner. The company was registered in October 1996, during FIFA President João Havelange's reign.Business #433268 at rgd.legalaffairs.gov.tt A second company was registered with the same name in July 1999.Business #436827 at rgd.legalaffairs.gov.tt The centre was funded by CONCACAF's development money for a four-year presidential term and also required funding from FIFA. It was first used in 1998 (officially opening in December 1999) and is CONCACAF's only development centre. At the planning stage Warner valued the cost of the work would be 16 million USD. The FIFA development budget between 1999 and 2002 for the CONCACAF region was 10 million USD. In addition, FIFA secured a 6 million USD loan from Union Bank of Switzerland, and paid it when no payment came from Caribbean Football Union or CONCACAF. Warner said that the centre is named after João Havelange for agreeing to fund the development. The development, despite being paid for by football bodies, was registered in the name of two Warner-owned companies. In 2001, a FIFA goal programme, headed by Warner, invested $400k in an indoor facility at the site; in addition FIFA provided a further $100k in a futsal- related 'special fund' and CONCACAF raised $143k. Four years later, a second FIFA goal programme, again headed by Warner invested a further $400k for a new artificial pitch. == Facilities == *Garden sanctuary - used for weddings and corporate functions *André Kamperveen Hall *Ken Galt Hall *Guillermo Cañedo Hall - used for concerts and trade shows *Joseph Blatter Hall - used for concerts and trade shows *Marvin Lee Stadium - outdoor football stadium *A swimming complex with two outdoor pools, a 25-metre pool, and a 12-metre pool *Le Sportel Inn - 44-room hotel *The Nelson Mandela Room - conference room == Controversy == Investigative journalist Lasana Liburd reported that Warner owned the Centre of Excellence through two companies; CCAM and Company, and Renraw Investments. Warner and his wife, Maureen, are listed as directors for both companies. Also, the land upon which the Centre of Excllence was built, is also owned by Warner. Ownership was transferred to him and Renraw Investments from businessman and Trinidad's Guardian newspaper owner Anthony Norman Sabga and FirstCaribbean International Bank director Michael Kelvin Mansoo in October 1998. On 18 September 1998, Renraw Investments and CCAM and Company took out a $2 million mortgage with First Citizens Bank and the Centre of Excellence was listed as a borrower along with Renraw Investments, CCAM and Company, and Jack Warner. CONCACAF's signatory was Harold Taylor, then CONCACAF assistant secretary and CFU general secretary. On 4 June 2007, Jack Warner and Lisle Austin co-signed an $11 million mortgage allowing Warner to borrow against the value of the \\"Centre of Excellence\\". Austin Lisle, the Barbados Football Association President and CONCACAF vice-president later claimed that he had only signed the contract and was not a beneficiary of borrowed funds. Another loan was made by a political supporter of Jack Warner's UNC party, Krishna Lalla and his company Real Time Systems Ltd. Lalla filed a lawsuit in 2011 claiming he was owed $28.1 million TTD and the lawsuit shown that one of companies secured against was the Centre of Excellence. In May 2012, FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated that FIFA would attempt to retrieve control of the centre through legal means. Warner denied that he is owner. Warner says that the Caribbean Football Union are the owners of the centre. Jeffrey Webb, the CONCACAF and Cayman Islands Football Association President said that he was \\"shell-shocked, dismayed and upset\\" at the revelations. == References == Category:CONCACAF Category:Caribbean Football Union Category:Association football training grounds in Trinidad and Tobago Category:Football venues in Trinidad and Tobago Category:1988 establishments in Trinidad and Tobago ","title":"Dr. João Havelange Centre of Excellence"},{"id":"35953952","text":"Three vessels of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Coureur, or HMS Coureuse, after the French for \\"runner\\" (masculine and feminine, respectively): ==Coureur== * was a French lugger that Jacques and Daniel Denys built at Dunkirk and launched on 8 May 1776.Demerliac (1996), p.84, #550. , under the command of Lieutenant William George Fairfax, engaged and captured her on 17 June 1778, in advance of the declaration of war.

At early 1990s she was involved in politics and worked in Lensoviet. From 1994 onwards she became a journalist. The turning point in her career was her 2001 meeting with Nick Perumov, already a popular fantasy writer by the time.Vera Kamsha biography on Fantlab.ru She interviewed him and the two found many similarities in taste (such as their love to Nikolai Gumilev's poetry). It was under Perumov's influence that Kamsha made first attempts to write and publish fantasy books. In 2001, Kamsha's first novel, Dark Star () was published by Eksmo. The book started Chronicles of Artsia series, a traditional Medieval high fantasy. Kamsha's later books, Gleams of Aeterna series in particular, were heavily influenced by George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire, as well as by Alexander Dumas's historical adventure novels.

The plot revolves around the power rivalry of two dynasties, where both sides have their flaws and neither is idealized.

The second tropical cyclone of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl developed on May 26 from a low- pressure system offshore North Carolina. Initially subtropical, the storm slowly acquired tropical characteristics as it tracked across warmer sea surface temperatures and within an environment of decreasing vertical wind shear. Late on May 27, Beryl transitioned into a tropical cyclone less than from North Florida. Early the following day, the storm moved ashore near Jacksonville Beach, Florida, with peak winds of 65 mph (100 km/h). It quickly weakened to a tropical depression, dropping heavy rainfall while moving slowly across the southeastern United States. A cold front turned Beryl to the northeast, and the storm became extratropical on May 30\\\\. The precursor to Beryl produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, causing flooding, mudslides and two deaths. Torrential rain also affected south Florida and the Bahamas. After forming, Beryl produced rough surf along the US southeastern coast, leaving one person from Folly Beach, South Carolina missing. Upon making landfall in Florida, the storm produced strong winds that left 38,000 people without power. High rains alleviated drought conditions and put out wildfires along the storm's path. A fallen tree killed a man driving in Orangeburg County, South Carolina. In northeast North Carolina, Beryl spawned an EF1 tornado that snapped trees and damaged dozens of homes near the city of Peletier. Overall damage was minor, estimated at $148,000. ==Meteorological history== The origins of Beryl were from a trough that developed over the Yucatán Peninsula on May 16\\\\. It drifted eastward into the northwestern Caribbean Sea, spawning a low pressure area on May 18\\\\. For the next three days, it remained nearly stationary without development, until the system became better defined on May 22 when it began moving to the northeast. On May 23, the elongated low had an area of disorganized convection. While passing over the Cuban Island of Isla de la Juventud, an exposed center of circulation and transient convection was noted due to the effects of high wind shear across the region. The next day, the system moved through the Florida Keys, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) noted the potential for increasingly favorable conditions over the next two days. The low became better defined as its cloud pattern consolidated. It moved further into the western Atlantic over the next 24 hours, and a band of convection extended across the Bahamas and Cuba to wrap around the southwestern edge of the circulation. On May 25, the system interacted with a mid- to upper-level low, causing the center to reform further to the northeast. After the system attained gale-force winds near the center and sufficiently organized convection, the NHC initiated advisories on Subtropical Storm Beryl at 0300 UTC on May 26, while the cyclone was 305 mi (490 km) east of Charleston, South Carolina. Post-season analysis indicated that Beryl developed three hours prior. Beryl shortly before being classified as a subtropical storm on May 25 Following Beryl's formation, there was a receding trough over New England that initially created a weak steering environment. Marginally warm waters and dry air were expected to prevent significant intensification, and convection remained minimal through May 26\\\\. Later that day, a building ridge caused Beryl to begin a steady southwest motion. By that time, the low-level center became vertically aligned with the upper-level center. The environment near the storm's center became moister and the system began to pass over warmer sea surface temperatures, allowing convection to increase. On May 27, the storm began a transition into a tropical cyclone, which it completed by 1800 UTC that day. As Beryl approached northeastern Florida, it became better organized, with increased convection in bands around the center. Late on May 27, the Hurricane Hunters observed flight-level winds of , suggesting maximum sustained winds of 70 mph (110 km/h); this would be Beryl's peak intensity. It is possible, however, that Beryl briefly reached hurricane intensity early in the evening of May 27 based on Doppler radar velocities, although the data is inconclusive according to the post-season report. At roughly 0410 UTC on May 28 (just after midnight local time), the storm made landfall near Jacksonville Beach, Florida, with winds of about after weakening slightly on the final approach. After moving ashore, Beryl quickly weakened to a tropical depression. It slowed due to the weakening ridge to its north, and an approaching cold front turned it to the north and northeast on May 29. Despite being well inland, Beryl retained enough convection to remain a tropical cyclone. As Beryl approached the Atlantic Ocean on May 30, its convection increased to the south and east of the center, although the intrusion of dry air resulted in a ragged appearance on satellite imagery. Based on reports from ships, Beryl was upgraded to a tropical storm on May 30 near the South Carolina coastline. The approaching front caused the storm to accelerate northeastward. Beryl's circulation became elongated and its associated convection spread northward, suggesting the transition into an extratropical cyclone. By late on May 30, Beryl became extratropical, prompting the NHC to discontinue advisories. The storm continued to the northeast, later turning to the east-southeast. On June 2, a larger extratropical storm absorbed the remnants of Beryl to the southeast of Newfoundland. ==Preparations, impact, and records== When Beryl made landfall in Jacksonville Beach, Florida with , it became the strongest tropical cyclone at landfall in the U.S. outside of the official Atlantic hurricane season. Beryl was also the second tropical storm to form before the start of the season, which marked only the fifth such occurrence since records began in 1851; the other four occurrences were in 1887, 1908, 1951, 2016, and 2020. ===Cuba and The Bahamas=== Flooding in Doral, Florida on May 22 from the precursor to Beryl Before becoming a tropical cyclone, Beryl produced heavy rainfall over Cuba, especially Sancti Spíritus Province, where rainfall peaked at . The rains caused mudslides and forced more than 8,500 people to evacuate their homes. Two people died after trying to cross flooded rivers. Flooding damaged 1,109 houses and destroyed 47 others. Although the rains flooded widespread areas of crop fields, the precipitation was beneficial in refilling reservoirs in drought-struck areas of the country. A band of thunderstorms and heavy rainfall moved across The Bahamas and dropped about of precipitation in Freeport, Grand Bahama. Low-lying areas in New Providence experienced flooding. Residents reported that a tornado touched down in Murphy Town, Abaco, downing power and telephone lines, overturning vehicles and damaging the roofs of three buildings. Rain from the system also affected the Berry Islands, Abaco, and Bimini, as well as several smaller island groups. ===Florida=== Storm total rainfall produced by Tropical Storm Beryl across the Southeast United States Prior to being classified as a tropical cyclone, the precursor to Beryl produced locally heavy rainfall in South Florida, reaching at Miami International Airport. The total was the second highest daily rainfall ever recorded in the month of May at the station. The rain caused extensive street flooding, especially in Sweetwater and Doral, stranding drivers and afternoon commuters. Miami Dade College was forced to cancel morning classes on May 23. When the NHC issued their first advisory, the agency also issued a tropical storm warning from the Brevard/Volusia county line in Florida to Edisto Beach, South Carolina. A tropical storm watch was issued northward to the mouth of the Santee River in South Carolina. A state of emergency was issued in Jacksonville, Florida, causing the early ending of a jazz festival and Memorial Day events. When Beryl moved ashore, airports around Jacksonville canceled all flights except for JetBlue Airways and Delta Air Lines. A teenager died in high seas in Daytona Beach, Florida. High surf and rip currents caused lifeguards in the region to restrict swimming in the ocean. The highest storm surge was at Fernandina Beach. When the storm moved ashore, Beryl produced strong winds along the coast, peaking at 54 mph (87 km/h) at Huguenot Park in Jacksonville; nearby Buck Island reported a peak wind gust of 72 mph (117 km/h). The winds prompted the Mathews Bridge and Wonderwood Bridge to close. Toppled power lines left about 38,000 residences in Jacksonville without power. In Jacksonville, flash flooding affected areas along Hogans Creek, and waves damaged a seawall and some docks. The waters entered a condominium and three vehicles. Flash flooding covered a portion of U.S. Route 129 in Suwannee County. Damage in Jacksonville was estimated at $20,000. South of Jacksonville, the outer circulation of Beryl spawned a short-lived EF0 tornado in Port Saint Lucie that caused minor damage to two homes. Damage from the tornado was estimated at $20,000. Another tornado was reported in Yankeetown. Due to its slow motion, Beryl dropped heavy rainfall across Florida, peaking at in Wellborn. Just South of Wellborn, a motorcyclist in Taylor County, Florida was killed when a car hydroplaned on the flooded highway and struck him head-on. First responders noted that it took them 20 minutes to cover the ten miles due to the nonexistent visibility. Gainesville reported on May 28, which broke the previous daily rainfall record. Hernando County Airport broke its daily rainfall record on May 29 with a total of , which was also the greatest daily rainfall to date in 2012. The rains extinguished 80 percent of the 25 wildfires in northern Florida. In Levy County, a waterspout dissipated while moving onshore. The high rains flooded several homes in Citrus County, causing about $108,000 in damage. ===Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina=== Hours before the storm moved ashore on May 27, officials in Cumberland Island, Georgia mandated that all campers evacuate the island. Although the storm made landfall in Florida, its storm surge flooded portions of St. Marys, Georgia. Rainfall in the state peaked at at Woodbine. Beryl's rainfall was beneficial in alleviating drought conditions, despite causing some minor flooding. Wind gusts along the Georgia coastline peaked at 55 mph (89 km/h) at Jekyll Island, and sustained tropical force winds extended into the state. Downed trees damaged two homes in McIntosh County, and in Orangeburg County, South Carolina, a falling tree killed a man driving on a state highway. This was the only direct death due to the storm; the others were indirectly related. The highest wind gust in South Carolina was 46 mph (74 km/h) in Fort Johnson, although stronger winds occurred just offshore. Rains in the state peaked at in Jasper County. High tides in Charleston Harbor sank a boat, forcing the crew to be rescued by the Coast Guard. In Folly Beach, South Carolina, one person went missing after swimming in rough surf, but it was not included in the overall death toll. After Beryl began accelerating to the northeast, it dropped heavy rainfall in the Carolinas, causing isolated flooding near Wilmington, North Carolina. Farther north in Peletier, the storm spawned an EF1 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita scale that damaged 67 homes and destroyed 3 others. Moisture from the storm spread northward into Maryland and West Virginia. ==See also== *Other storms named Beryl *List of off-season Atlantic hurricanes *Tropical Storm Arlene (1959) *Subtropical Storm Andrea (2007) *Tropical Storm Ana (2015) *Tropical Storm Bonnie (2016) *Tropical Storm Bertha (2020) ==NotesReferencesExternal links== *Tropical Storm Beryl Advisory Archive Category:2012 Atlantic hurricane season Category:Off-season Atlantic tropical cyclones Category:Atlantic tropical storms Beryl ","title":"Tropical Storm Beryl (2012)"},{"id":"35954052","text":"Francisco \\"Frank\\" Morán Benavides (ca. 1880 - death date unknown) was a Cuban baseball outfielder and catcher in the Cuban League and Negro leagues.

(2008) \\"scroll\\" in A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology 1450–2000 Online edition. Oxford University Press, 2008. http://www.oxfordreference.com Retrieved 21 November 2013. The history of scrolls dates back to ancient Egypt. In most ancient literate cultures scrolls were the earliest format for longer documents written in ink or paint on a flexible background, preceding bound books; rigid media such as clay tablets were also used but had many disadvantages in comparison. For most purposes scrolls have long been superseded by the codex book format, but they are still produced for some ceremonial or religious purposes, notably for the Jewish Torah scroll for use in synagogues. ==Origins in Africa== Scrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean ancient Egyptian civilizations. Parchment scrolls were used by several early civilizations before the codex, or bound book with pages, was invented by the Romans and popularized by Christianity. Nevertheless, scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into Roman times. ==Eastern Mediterranean, West Asia and EuropeIsrael=== Scrolls were used by the Hebrews to record their religious texts, which today is referred to as the Tanakh. Some of these ancient scrolls are known today, ie, the Dead Sea Scrolls. ===Greece and Rome=== Roman portraiture fresco of a young man with a papyrus scroll, from Herculaneum, 1st century AD Scrolls were used by the ancient Greeks. In Roman usage the scrolls were written latitudinally, usually placed on podiums with roll holders from which the rolls were unwound. The Romans eventually found the scroll too cumbersome for lengthy works and developed the codex, which is the formal name for the modern style of book, with individual pages bound together. ===Early Christian era=== Scrolls continued to be used at times during the Early Church era until the Early Middle Ages, but Christianity was an early adopter of the codex. It is often thought that this reflects the background in trade of many early Christians, who were used to codex notebooks, and less attached to the form that was traditional among the Roman elite and religious Jews. ===European Middle Ages=== Scrolls virtually ceased to be used for books and documents in Europe during the Middle Ages, and were reintroduced for rare use in official treaties and other international documents of great significance during and after the Baroque Era of the 17th century. These were usually written on high quality vellum, and stored in elaborate silver and gold cases inscribed with names of participants. Earlier examples were written in Latin. Scrolls continued in use for administrative and accounting purposes all over Europe. In English they were often referred to as \\"rolls\\", hence the Great Rolls of the English Exchequer, and titles such as Master of the Rolls (a senior judge), still used in the 21st century. The official copy of English, now British, legislation was still printed on vellum in a roll format and stored in the Palace of Westminster until 2017, when the use of Vellum was replaced with archival paper.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/21/anger-mps-bow-peers- pressure-end-500-year-old-tradition-printing/ The Exultet Scroll from Southern Italy and Byzantine Joshua Scroll were prestige objects that used the old form in a revivalist spirit. ===West and Central Asia=== Scrolls continued in use longer in the Islamic world, often elaborately decorated in calligraphic writing that included use of gold embossing and pigments when used for the writing of the Qur'an. ===East Asia=== Scrolls continued in use longer in East Asian cultures like China, Korea and Japan. The Chinese invented and perfected 'Indian Ink' for use in writing, including scrolls. Originally designed for blacking the surfaces of raised stone-carved hieroglyphics, the ink was a mixture of soot from pine smoke and lamp oil mixed with the gelatin of donkey skin and musk. The ink invented by the Chinese philosopher, Tien-Lcheu (2697 B.C.), became common by the year 1200 B.C. Later other formats came into use in China, firstly the sutra or scripture binding, a scroll folded concertina- style, which avoids the need to unroll to find a passage in the middle. By about 1,000 CE, sheet-based formats were introduced, although scrolls continued to have a place. Traditional painting and calligraphy in East Asia is often still performed on relatively short latitudinal paper scrolls displayed vertically as a hanging scroll on a wall or horizontally and flat as a handscroll. ==Replacement by the Codex== The codex was a new format for reading the written word, consisting of individual pages loosely attached to each other at one side and bound with boards or cloth. It came to replace the scroll thanks to several problems that limited the scroll's function and readability. For one, scrolls were very long, sometimes as long as ten meters. This made them hard to hold open and read, a difficulty not helped by the fact that most scrolls in that era were read horizontally, instead of vertically as scrolling virtual documents are read now. The text on a scroll was continuous, without page breaks, which made indexing and bookmarking impossible. Conversely, the codex was easier to hold open, separate pages made it possible to index sections and mark a page, and the protective covers kept the fragile pages intact better than scrolls generally stayed. This last made it particularly attractive for important religious texts.Lyons, M. (2011) Books: A Living History. Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. p. 35-36 Another aspect that made the codex more attractive than the scroll was ease of copying. It was possible to hold open a codex with one hand and write notes- or copy the text- with the other. For early Christendom this was an invaluable asset, as the ability to mass reproduce their gospels was in high demand. Early Medieval Christians were some of the first to adopt the codex over the scroll.Frost, Gary, \\"Adoption of the Codex Book: Parable of a New Reading Mode\\", The Book and Paper Group Annual, Retrieved 12/1/2014 The codex began to replace the scroll almost as soon as it was invented. For example, in Egypt by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered the scroll or roll by ten to one based on surviving examples, and by the sixth century the scroll had almost vanished from use as a vehicle for literature.Roberts, Colin H., and Skeat, T.C. (1987), The Birth of the Codex. London: Oxford University Press for the British Academy, p. 75. However, in other places the scroll lingered. As mentioned above, English monarchs used so called “statute rolls” to record important legislation until well into the Middle Ages. Scrolls were also commonly used in theater productions, a practice from which the term “actor’s roll” was coined.Lyons, M. (2011) Books: A Living History. Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. p. 37 ==Modern era== Hanging scrolls of calligraphy on display, Shanghai Torah Scrolls are still used today in Jewish religious observance with almost insignificant changes despite the thousands of years in practice. Some cultures use scrolls as ceremonial texts or for decoration—such as a hanging scroll—without any obvious division of the text into columns. In some scroll-using cultures painted illustrations were used as header decorations above the text columns, either in a continuous band or broken into scenes above either a single or double column of text. One of the few modern texts the original of which was written on what is effectively a scroll is the manuscript of Jack Kerouac's On the Road, typed onto what he called \\"the scroll\\", made of taped-together sheets of paper. The verb \\"to scroll\\" is much used in the age of screen displays—computer displays, rolling credits in films and so on—with the screen filled with text moving (scrolling) up or down or sideways, appearing at one edge of the display and disappearing at the other as if being unrolled from one side of a scroll and rolled up at the other. == See also == * History of writing * History of books == References External links== *Encyclopaedia Romana: \\"Scroll and codex\\" Category:Manuscripts by type Scrolls ","title":"History of scrolls"},{"id":"35954228","text":"McCoury is a surname.

It was built in 1935 with lumber that was put into the saltwater and floated to the shore at Port Allen, the seawater adding a natural termite protection to the lumber. The camp was in continual use for forest management, until Hurricane Iwa devastated it in 1982. In the 1990s it was restored through the efforts of the non-profit Hui O Laka environmental group, and is currently open to the public. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Hawaii on December 20, 1996. ==History== The camp was originally built in 1935 as one of five Hawaii camps constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal stimulus. The other four camps have been absorbed by population growth, and Koke'e is the lone camp remaining in a natural environment. The CCC at Koke'e provided forest management, by building trails, roads, and fences, as well as planting over a million trees on Kauai. They helped fight forest fires, eradicate unwanted feral mammals, and collected tree seeds. In addition, the CCC from Koke'e also built the CCC camp at Waialae Cabin. In 1943, the program had been disbanded, and the camp was used by the 443d Airlift Wing during World War II. From 1966 until 1973, the Job Corps occupied the premises and provided forest management, followed by the Youth Conservation Corps. The camp was abandoned in 1982 after Hurricane Iwa. The camp is operated by the non-profit local environmental group Hui O Laka, which is dedicated to educating, enhancing, and maintaining Koke'e. In 1990, the Hawaii State Legislature provided Hui O Laka a $20,000 Grant-in-Aid for renovations to the camp. The restoration and continual maintenance of the camp has been provided by members of Hui O Laka, and by volunteers. There are seventeen contributing, and three non- contributing buildings, sites, and structures on the site. During construction, the lumber could not be lifted directly onto the shore, because of the shallowness of Port Allen and the lack of equipment to accomplish the task. Instead, the lumber was floated ashore in the salt water. The soaking in seawater gave the lumber lasting termite protection, allowing the wood to be virtually intact when the camp was added to the NRHP in 1996. The non- contributing buildings were built after 1950. ===Contributing buildings=== *Executive building (in use for overnight accommodations) *Camp administration building (in use as the Natural History Museum) *Mess hall *\\"A\\" Barracks *\\"B\\" Barracks *\\"C\\" Barracks *Recreation lodge destroyed in 1982 by Hurricane Iwa *Foremen cabin *Building 9, storage *Supply room *Cooler room *Gas house, formerly used as a garage *Building 14, small wooden building *Building 15, cook's house demolished in 1993 *Building 16, formerly a garage and workshop *Ranger's cabin built in 1930 *Building \\"I\\" old laundry room ==Facilities, fees== Reservations are required for overnight accommodations at the camp.

Bundesliga after a five-year absence. Despite the success of last season, they had to largely rebuild their squad – the strike partnership of Alexander Esswein and Dani Schahin left the club in the summer, as did captain Thomas Hübener, among others. A total of 19 new players joined, notably a new strike pairing of Zlatko Dedic and Mickaël Poté who scored 25 goals between them. After a slow start, Dynamo settled into mid-table, finishing 9th, never in contention for promotion or relegation. In the DFB-Pokal, they achieved a shock first round win over Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen, before being eliminated in the next round by German champions (and eventual cup winners) Borussia Dortmund.

These components typically consist of a front end platform (fat client, thin client, mobile ),back end platforms (servers, storage), a cloud based delivery, and a network (Internet, Intranet, Intercloud). Combined, these components make up cloud computing architecture. Cloud Computing Sample Architecture ==Client platforms== Cloud computing architectures consist of front-end platforms called clients or cloud clients. These clients are servers, fat (or thick) clients, thin clients, zero clients, tablets and mobile devices that users directly interact with. These client platforms interact with the cloud data storage via an application (middle ware), via a web browser, or through a virtual session. Virtual sessions in particular require secure encryption algorithm frame working which spans the entire interface. ===Zero client=== The zero or ultra-thin client initializes the network to gather required configuration files that then tell it where its OS binaries are stored. The entire zero client device runs via the network. This creates a single point of failure, in that, if the network goes down, the device is rendered useless. ==Storage== An online network storage where data is stored and accessible to multiple clients. Cloud storage is generally deployed in the following configurations: public cloud, private cloud, community cloud, or some combination of the three also known as hybrid cloud. In order to be effective, the cloud storage needs to be agile, flexible, scalable, multi-tenancy, and secure. ==DeliverySoftware as a service (SaaS)=== The software-as-a-service (SaaS) service-model involves the cloud provider installing and maintaining software in the cloud and users running the software from cloud over the Internet (or Intranet). The users' client machines require no installation of any application-specific software since cloud applications run in the cloud. SaaS is scalable, and system administrators may load the applications on several servers. In the past, each customer would purchase and load their own copy of the application to each of their own servers, but with the SaaS the customer can access the application without installing the software locally. SaaS typically involves a monthly or annual fee. Software as a service provides the equivalent of installed applications in the traditional (non-cloud computing) delivery of applications. Software as a service has four common approaches: # single instance # multi-instance # multi-tenant # flex tenancy Of these, flex tenancy is considered the most user adaptive SaaS paradigm in designated multi-input four way manifold models. Such systems are based on simplified encryption methods that target listed data sequences over multiple passes. The simplicity of this concept makes flex tenancy SaaS popular among those without informatics processing experience, such as basic maintenance and custodial staff in franchise businesses. ===Development as a service (DaaS)=== Development as a service is web based, community shared tool set. This is the equivalent to locally installed development tools in the traditional (non- cloud computing) delivery of development tools. ===Data as a service (DaaS)=== Data as a service is web based design construct where cloud data is accessed through a defined API layer. DaaS services are often considered as a specialized subset of a Software as a Service (SaaS) offering.O. Terzo, P. Ruiu, E. Bucci and F. Xhafa, \\"Data as a Service (DaaS) for Sharing and Processing of Large Data Collections in the Cloud,\\" 2013 Seventh International Conference on Complex, Intelligent, and Software Intensive Systems, Taichung, 2013 ===Platform as a service (PaaS)=== Platform as a service is cloud computing service which provides the users with application platforms and databases as a service. This is equivalent to middleware in the traditional (non-cloud computing) delivery of application platforms and databases. ===Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)=== Infrastructure as a service is taking the physical hardware and going completely virtual (e.g. all servers, networks, storage, and system management all existing in the cloud). This is the equivalent to infrastructure and hardware in the traditional (non-cloud computing) method running in the cloud. In other words, businesses pay a fee (monthly or annually) to run virtual servers, networks, storage from the cloud. This will mitigate the need for a data center, heating, cooling, and maintaining hardware at the local level. ==Networking== Generally, the cloud network layer should offer: * High bandwidth and low latency :Allowing users to have uninterrupted access to their data and applications.M. Noormohammadpour, C. S. Raghavendra, \\"Datacenter Traffic Control: Understanding Techniques and Trade-offs,\\" IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, vol. PP, no. 99, pp. 1-1. * Agile network :On-demand access to resources requires the ability to move quickly and efficiently between servers and possibly even clouds. * Network security :Security is always important, but when you are dealing with multi-tenancy, it becomes much more important because you're dealing with segregating multiple customers. ==See also== *Cloud collaboration *Cloud computing *Cloud computing comparison *Cloud database *Cloud storage ==Further reading== * Reese, G.

The two initially competed on WWE NXT, debuting as a team in January 2012 and were later promoted to the main roster in April of that year. After disbanding and a brief feud in 2014, The Prime Times Players reunited in February 2015 and subsequently captured the WWE Tag Team Championship from The New Day, at Money in the Bank before splitting once again in February 2016 and subsequently starting a feud between the two again. ==HistoryFormation (2012)=== The Prime Time Players in November 2013 Initially, O'Neil (who was then a face) and Young were rivals on WWE NXT during its fifth season, named NXT Redemption. Early on, O'Neil was paired with then-friend Percy Watson against Young and his NXT pro, Chavo Guerrero. The feud was put on hold when Guerrero was released and Young was suspended. On the November 16, 2011, episode of NXT, O'Neil was assaulted by a returning Young. Young was then able to get the better of O'Neil twice in tag team matches. The conclusion to O'Neil's feud with Young came when O'Neil defeated Young in a no disqualification match on the January 18 episode of NXT. O'Neil then turned heel after the match, verbally ripping on the audience, his former pro Hornswoggle, and NXT itself. O'Neil urged Watson to also turn his back on the fans on the January 25, 2012, episode of NXT Redemption. When Watson refused, O'Neil shoved him and a match between the two was booked, leading to O'Neil defeating Watson. O'Neil continued to attack Watson after the match, leading to Alex Riley saving Watson. O'Neil then formed an alliance with former enemy Young, and the duo teamed up to defeat Watson and Riley on the February 1 and February 29 episodes of NXT Redemption. O'Neil also faced and defeated Riley on the February 22 episode. On the March 7 episode, Watson received his rematch against O'Neil and defeated O'Neil. O'Neil and Young then moved on to feud with The Usos. ===WWE Tag Team Championship pursuits and split (2012–2014)=== On the April 18 episode of NXT Redemption, it was announced that O'Neil and Young had been moved to the main roster. The team made their debut for the SmackDown brand on the April 20 episode of SmackDown with a victory over The Usos. They started on a winning streak defeating the likes Ezekiel Jackson and Yoshi Tatsu and Santino Marella and Zack Ryder. However, on the May 18 edition of SmackDown, their winning streak ended when they were defeated by the Tag Team Champions Kofi Kingston and R-Truth. On the June 1 edition of SmackDown, O'Neil and Young named themselves the Prime Time Players. At No Way Out, they won a Fatal-four-Way tag team match to become the number one contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship following assistance from A. W. who had turned on his clients, Primo and Epico in favor of the Prime Time Players, prompting a feud between the two tag teams. On the July 16 episode of Raw, the Prime Time Players unsuccessfully challenged Kofi Kingston and R-Truth for the WWE Tag Team Championship. O'Neil and Young bounced back with two singles victories over Kingston and R-Truth. On the August 10 episode of SmackDown, they defeated Primo and Epico in a number one contenders match via disqualification when A. W. provoked Kofi and R-Truth (who were doing guest commentary) into interfering in the match. That same day, A. W. was released from his contract. On the August 13 edition of Raw, it was announced that the Prime Time Players would receive their championship match at SummerSlam. That same night, after R-Truth defeated Heath Slater, O'Neil and Young ambushed R-Truth and left him laying in the ring (Kingston was away on an international tour). At SummerSlam, O'Neil & Young were defeated by Kingston and R-Truth. On the September 7 edition of SmackDown, O'Neil and Young defeated Primo and Epico and The Usos in a triple threat tag match to once again become the number one contenders to the Tag Team Championship. The following week of Raw, they were defeated by Daniel Bryan and Kane, who became the new number one contenders. At Survivor Series, the Prime Time Players took part in a losing effort in a ten-man elimination tag team match. In an interview released on August 15, 2013, Young revealed his homosexual orientation in real-life. On the August 19 episode of Raw, the Prime Time Players started to wrestle as faces, due to management's and the fans' support for Darren Young coming out. At the pre- show of Night of Champions, the Prime Time Players won a \\"Tag Team Turmoil\\" match and thus a title shot by last eliminating the Real Americans (Antonio Cesaro and Jack Swagger). Later that night, they lost to defending champions Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns of the Shield. After their face turn they did several comedy segments backstage including selling merchandise and a hotdog eating contest. On the January 31, 2014, episode of SmackDown after Young was pinned in a tag team match against Ryback and Curtis Axel, O'Neil viciously attacked him after the match, turning heel and officially disbanding the team. They would have a match at Elimination Chamber, with O'Neil getting the victory. A rematch took place on the February 26 episode of Main Event, which was won by Young. In April, Young underwent surgery to repair a torn ACL in his left knee that would take him out of action for several months. Meanwhile, O'Neil formed a dysfunctional tag team with Heath Slater, known as Slater- Gator (a reference to O'Neil being a Florida Gator), to little success. ===Reunion and WWE Tag Team Champions (2015–2016)=== O'Neil and Young in March 2015 On February 16 episode of Raw, O'Neil made a save for Young who, along with independent wrestler Kevin Kross, was being attacked by The Ascension. This signified a reunion of the team and face turn for O'Neil. On the February 23 episode of Raw, they officially reunited and gave The Ascension their first loss in the WWE. They once again defeated The Ascension on March 14 episode of Main Event. They then participated in the André the Giant Memorial Trophy Battle Royal at WrestleMania 31, which was won by The Big Show. After WrestleMania, they began performing comedic skits that poked fun at other tag teams including The New Day, The Ascension, Los Matadores and Tyson Kidd and Cesaro. They became one of the five teams to challenge the New Day for the Tag Titles at Elimination Chamber, and eliminated The Ascension and Tyson Kidd and Cesaro, but lost after all of The New Day pinned Titus O'Neil. The following week on SmackDown, they won a triple threat tag team match against the Lucha Dragons and The Ascension, to become the number one contenders for the tag team championship against The New Day at Money in the Bank. At Money in the Bank, the Prime Time Players defeated The New Day to capture the WWE Tag Team Championship, their first ever titles in WWE. At Battleground, the Prime Time Players successfully retained their titles against The New Day. At SummerSlam, The New Day defeated The Prime Time Players in a Fatal-4-Way tag team match to become the new WWE Tag Team Champions. On the September 7 episode of Raw, it was announced that The New Day would defend the titles against The Prime Time Players in a rematch the following week, and the winners would defend the titles against The Dudley Boyz at Night of Champions. On the September 14 episode of Raw, The New Day defeated The Prime Time Players, thus setting up The New Day vs. The Dudley Boyz for Night of Champions. Towards the end of 2015, O'Neil and Young began focusing on singles careers. On the November 9 episode of Raw, O'Neil competed in the first round of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship tournament against Kevin Owens, in a losing effort. At the Survivor Series pre-show, O'Neil teamed with a returning Goldust, The Dudley Boyz and Neville against The Cosmic Wasteland, The Miz and Bo Dallas, in a five-on-five traditional Survivor Series elimination tag team match, in a winning effort. O'Neil and Young appeared as a team on January 15, 2016, at a house show on WWE's India tour.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=142969 Young teamed with Damien Sandow on the Royal Rumble 2016 Kickoff Show in a Fatal 4-Way tag team match, while O'Neil competed in the Royal Rumble match itself. On the February 2, 2016, taping of Main Event, the duo returned to team with The Usos, to defeat The Ascension, Stardust and Tyler Breeze. They have since quietly disbanded when O'Neil received a 60-day suspension after the February 8 episode of Raw after an alleged physical altercation with Vince McMahon. After O'Neil's suspension, both Young and O'Neil returned to singles competition. O'Neil began a feud with Rusev for the WWE United States Championship while Young started a storyline with Bob Backlund, challenging The Miz for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. ===Second feud (2016)=== When the WWE Draft returned in July 2016, both of them were drafted to the Raw brand. On the August 1 episode of Raw, O'Neil started a slow heel turn when he questioned Young's motives on being \\"great again\\". Later that night, he defeated Young when he pinned him while grabbing Young's tights. Afterwards, he got into a backstage altercation Bob Backlund before Young came to the defense of Backlund by attacking O'Neil. The week after on Raw, Young defeated O'Neil via pinfall by grabbing O'Neil's tights, mimicking the way O'Neil defeated him. On the August 15 episode of Raw, Young and O'Neil reconciled and were placed in an ad hoc tag team match against The Shining Stars. During the match, O'Neil attacked Young, officially turning heel in the process for the first time since 2015.

After beginning her career in provincial theatres in Britain in music hall and pantomime in the 1880s, Ediss was engaged to play in a series of extraordinarily successful musical comedies at the Gaiety Theatre, London, beginning in 1896, and also played in several musicals on Broadway. During World War I, she began a long tour in Australia, returning to London in 1919 to play in farces and comedies. She made a few films in the 1930s. ==Early life and career== Ediss was born in Brighton, England, the eldest child of Charles Coates, a house painter, and his wife Jane.Census Returns of England and Wales, 1881.

Her mother and her aunt had both been members of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.\\"A Talented Actress\\", The Advertiser, Adelaide, Australia, 20 April 1918, accessed 29 May 2012 She began her career in provincial theatres at the age of 12,\\"Connie Ediss Dead\\", The Courier-Mail, Brisbane, Queensland, 20 April 1934, p. 17 originally using the stage name \\"Connie Coutts\\".Parker, p. 289 She made her first appearance on a London stage in 1893 singing and dancing in variety shows at Albert Chevalier's Trocadero music hall.Weekly Dispatch, London, 20 January 1907, p. 6f She also played in pantomime as a principal boy. Ediss (left) with Edmund Payne, George Grossmith, Jr. and Gertie Millar in The Orchid, 1903 She received a lucky break in 1895 when she was asked to fill in for an ailing Nellie Farren at the Gaiety Theatre, London. George Edwardes signed Ediss to a three-year contract. The Times later commented, \\"Edwardes had an uncanny flair for personalities, and in his new recruit he found a personality indeed, an actress with a 'Gaiety sense', a comedian of a rare type, and a wholesome 'comfortable-looking' – his own words – foil to the orchidaceous showgirls of the Gaiety.\\"\\"Miss Connie Ediss\\", The Times, 20 April 1934, p. 9 Edwardes sent her to New York, where she appeared in the Broadway production of The Shop Girl as Ada Smith.Green, p. 378\\"Gaiety Theatre\\", Morning Post, 9 April 1896, p. 3 The next year, she returned to England to appear in Edwardian musical comedies at the Gaiety Theatre, beginning with My Girl and The Circus Girl, as Mme. Drivelli. In her roles at the Gaiety, she won critical praise for her \\"brightness, vivacity, and humour\\". She became known as for her comic \\"buxom bourgeoise\\" characters. These roles were \\"invariably the same, whatever the play ... the plump, attractive little lady with the infectious chuckle and the keen Cockney sanity\\". She next appeared in A Runaway Girl (1898) as Carmenita,\\"Matinee at the Assembly Rooms\\", Bath Chronicle and Weekly Gazette, 30 November 1899, p. 3 The Messenger Boy (1900) as Mrs. Bang,\\"Gaiety Tomorrow: The Messenger Boy\\", London Standard, 13 April 1900, p. 4 The Silver Slipper, The Toreador (1901) as Amelia, The Orchid (1903) as Caroline Twining, The Spring Chicken (1905) as Mrs. Girdle and The New Aladdin (1906) as Spirit of the Ring. In these shows, she popularised such songs as \\"Rosie\\", \\"I Ride to Win\\" and \\"What Could a Poor Girl Do?\\" In between two of these engagements, she performed comic sketches in a very successful music hall act with Henry Lytton.Lytton (Secrets), chapter 6, accessed 9 May 2008 Ediss then was sent to America to appear as Mrs. Henry Schniff in the 1907 Broadway production The Girl Behind the Counter. The New York Times commented on her \\"use of a grotesque costume, a good Cockney accent, and a prodigious sense of humor\\".\\"Sounds of Bow Bells along the Great White Way\\", The New York Times, 13 October 1907, accessed 30 May 2012 Later in 1907, she travelled to South Africa for a long music hall tour. She was back on Broadway for the American production of The Arcadians (1910) as Mrs. Smith.Green, p. 14 She then returned to England to play a role that was added for her to The Girl in the Train (1910), in which she sang \\"When I was in the Chorus at the Gaiety\\". Similarly, for Peggy (1911), when the popularity of the show began to wane, Edwardes had a new role written for Ediss. In The Sunshine Girl (1912), as Brenda Blacker, The Daily Mail said that Ediss \\"revels in the reckless drollery of\\" the role.\\"The Sunshine Girl\\", Daily Mail, 26 February 1912 Ediss next played in The Girl on the Film (1913) in the London production, and then in the Broadway production, as Euphemia Knox. ==Later years== In 1914, Ediss starred in the London revue Not Likely. Her next role was on Broadway in the musical Suzi (1914) as Lina Balzer. She was then in a Broadway play, Stolen Orders (1915).Connie Ediss, Internet Broadway Database, accessed 29 May 2012 She travelled to Australia and New Zealand in 1916 for another tour lasting more than two years, playing in musicals and other comedies. Ediss finally returned to England in 1919 and made no further overseas tours. She continued her career in West End theatre, playing in a long-running farce, Lord Richard in the Pantry, with Cyril Maude and Lydia Bilbrook (1919),\\"New Criterion Farce\\", The Times, 12 November 1919, p. 12 and then the comedy-thriller The Ghost Train (1923).\\"Death of Connie Ediss\\", The Manchester Guardian, 20 April 1934, p. 12 In 1926 she appeared alongside George Barrett in a production of the farcical comedy Bringing Up Father.\\"Kings Hall Biggin Street Dover – Miss Connie Ediss\\", Dover Express, 12 February 1926, p. 6 She toured the northern provinces in 1928 in the Walter C.

The protestors carried the portrait of the King taken from the municipality and burned tax files. La strage di Giardinello, La Sicilia, December 11, 2011 ==Background and conflict== The Fascio dei Lavoratori of Giardinello was founded just a few weeks before the massacre on November 13, 1893, and demanded to abolish taxes and duties on consumer goods and carts. A first explosion of discontent occurred on December 3, 1893 with the demonstration of women to demand a public laundry that had been assured and which was essential for the needs of the population. On December 10, the rally took place after Sunday Mass in the village of 814 inhabitants at the time. On leaving Mass, in front of the church a demonstration began, shouting: \\"Down with the taxes and the Town Hall\\" (Abbasso le tasse e il Municipio) and \\"Down with the field guards and the policemen\\" (Abbasso le guardie campestri e i birri).Colajanni, Gli avvenimenti di Sicila e le loro cause, pp. 175-78Tilly, The rebellious century, 1830-1930, p. 149 Things got out of hand when the manifestation reached the house of the mayor next to the town hall. The mayor's wife poured a bucket of water on the crowd from the window shouting: \\"I will cool down the heads of these bastards.\\" The premises were looted and part of the furniture and tax files were set on fire. Some demonstrators, mostly women, mastered two portraits of the king and the national flag, returned to the streets to demonstrate shouting: \\"Long live the House of Savoy\\", \\"Long live the King\\", \\"Long live the Queen\\". Troops were hastily summoned from Montelepre. When the situation was quieting down, shots were suddenly fired from the mayor's house leaving eight people dead on the spot and many seriously wounded.

In plants, it sometimes occurs in toxic amounts as forage, e.g. locoweed. Selenium is a component of the amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase.S. J. Lippard, J. M. Berg \\"Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry\\" University Science Books: Mill Valley, CA; 1994. . Selenium- containing proteins are produced from inorganic selenium via the intermediacy of selenophosphate (PSeO33−). ==Se-containing biomolecules== Selenium is an essential micronutrient in mammals, but is also recognized as toxic in excess. Selenium exerts its biological functions through selenoproteins, which contain the amino acid selenocysteine. Twenty-five selenoproteins are encoded in the human genome. ===Glutathione peroxidase=== The glutathione peroxidase family of enzymes (abbreviated GSH-Px) catalyze reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides: :2GSH + H2O2 → GSSG + 2 H2O The two H atoms are donated by thiols in a process that begins with oxidation of a selenol side chain in GSH-Px. The organoselenium compound ebselen is a drug used to supplement the action of GSH-Px. It functions as a catalyst for the destruction of hydrogen peroxide. A related selenium-containing enzyme in some plants and in animals (thioredoxin reductase) generates reduced thioredoxin, a dithiol that serves as an electron source for peroxidases and also the important reducing enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that makes DNA precursors from RNA precursors. ===Deiodinases=== Selenium also plays a role in the functioning of the thyroid gland. It participates as a cofactor for the three thyroid hormone deiodinases. These enzymes activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites. It may inhibit Hashimotos's disease, an auto-immune disease in which the body's own thyroid cells are attacked by the immune system. A reduction of 21% on TPO antibodies was reported with the dietary intake of 0.2 mg of selenium. ===Formate dehydrogenase=== Some microorganisms utilize selenium in formate dehydrogenase. Formate is produced in large amounts in the hepatic (liver cells) mitochondria of embryonic cells and in cancer cells by the folate cycle.H Frederik Nijhout, et al, In silico experimentation with a model of hepatic mitochondrial folate metabolism, Theoretical Biology and Medical Modeling, 2006, 3:40, link http://www.tbiomed.com/content/3/1/40/abstract). Formate is reversibly oxidized by the enzyme formate dehydrogenase: :HCO2− → CO2 \\\\+ H+ \\\\+ 2 e− === Thioredoxin reductase === Thioredoxin reductase uses a cysteine-selenocysteine pair to reduce the disulfide in thioredoxin. The selenocysteine is arranged in an unusual Sec-His-Glu catalytic triad, which tunes its pKa. ==Indicator plants== Certain species of plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil, since they require high levels of selenium to thrive. The main selenium indicator plants are Astragalus species (including some locoweeds), prince's plume (Stanleya sp.), woody asters (Xylorhiza sp.), and false goldenweed (Oonopsis sp.) ==Medical use of synthetic selenium compounds== The substance loosely called selenium sulfide (with the approximate formula SeS2) is the active ingredient in some anti-dandruff shampoos. The selenium compound kills the scalp fungus Malassezia, which causes shedding of dry skin fragments. The ingredient is also used in body lotions to treat Tinea versicolor due to infection by a different species of Malassezia fungus. ==Detection in biological fluids== Selenium may be measured in blood, plasma, serum or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims or to assist in a forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. Some analytical techniques are capable of distinguishing organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body prior to being eliminated in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.R. Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1416–1420. ==Toxicity== Although selenium is an essential trace element, it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis. This 400 microgram (µg) Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow up study on the same five people in 1992. The 1992 study actually found the maximum safe dietary Se intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to not only avoid toxicity, but also to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to account for data from other countries. In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (carbonaceous shale) have suffered from selenium toxicity. This coal was shown to have selenium content as high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded in literature. Symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can result in cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, and death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of their low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites are very toxic, having an oxidant mode of action similar to that of arsenic trioxide. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day for a long time. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses. Selenium poisoning of water systems may result whenever new agricultural runoff courses through normally dry, undeveloped lands. This process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds (such as selenates) into the water, which may then be concentrated in new \\"wetlands\\" as the water evaporates. High selenium levels produced in this fashion have been found to have caused certain congenital disorders in wetland birds. Relationship between survival of juvenile salmon and concentration of selenium in their tissues after 90 days (Chinook salmon: Hamilton et al. 1990) or 45 days (Atlantic salmon: Poston et al. 1976) exposure to dietary selenium. The 10% lethality level (LC10=1.84 µg/g) was derived by applying the biphasic model of Brain and Cousens (1989) to only the Chinook salmon data. The Chinook salmon data comprise two series of dietary treatments, combined here because the effects on survival are indistinguishable. In fish and other wildlife, low levels of selenium cause deficiency while high levels cause toxicity. For example, in salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium in the fish tissue (whole body) is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of tissue (dry weight). At levels much below that concentration, young salmon die from selenium deficiency; much above that level they die from toxic excess. ==Deficiency== Selenium deficiency can occur in patients with severely compromised intestinal function, those undergoing total parenteral nutrition, and in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are at risk. Although New Zealand has low levels of selenium in its soil, adverse health effects have not been detected. Selenium deficiency as defined by low (<60% of normal) selenoenzyme activity levels in brain and endocrine tissues only occurs when a low selenium status is linked with an additional stress, such as high exposures to mercury or as a result of increased oxidant stress due to vitamin E deficiency. Selenium interacts with other nutrients, such as iodide and vitamin E. The interaction is observed in the etiology of many deficiency diseases in animals, and pure selenium deficiency is rare. The effect of selenium deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly in relation to Kashin-Beck disease. ==Dietary recommendations== The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for selenium in 2000. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated Adequate Intake (AI) is used instead. The current EAR for selenium for people ages 14 and up is 45 μg/day. The RDA is 55 μg/day. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 60 μg/day. RDA for lactation is 70 μg/day. For children ages 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 20 to 40 μg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of selenium the UL is 400 μg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men ages 15 and older the AI is set at 70 μg/day. AI for pregnancy is 70 μg/day, for lactation 85 μg/day. For children ages 1–14 years the AIs increase with age from 15 to 55 μg/day. These AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 300 μg/day, which is lower than the U.S. value. For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For selenium labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 70 μg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 55 μg. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by 1 January 2020, for manufacturers with $10 million or more in annual food sales, and by 1 January 2021, for manufacturers with less than $10 million in annual food sales. During the first six months following the 1 January 2020 compliance date, the FDA plans to work cooperatively with manufacturers to meet the new Nutrition Facts label requirements and will not focus on enforcement actions regarding these requirements during that time. A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. In the United States, selenium deficiency is not common. A federal survey of food consumption determined that for women and men over the age of 19, average consumption from foods and beverages was 89 and 125 μg/day, respectively. For women and men of all ages fewer than 3% consumed less than the EAR.What We Eat In America, NHANES 2001–2002 . Table A15: Selenium. ==Food sources== Dietary selenium comes from nuts, cereals, meat, mushrooms, fish, and eggs. Brazil nuts are the richest ordinary dietary source and could cause selenium toxicity if consumed regularly – though the actual concentration of selenium (as with any plant- based food sources, such as another selenium-accumulating \\"paradise nut\\" Lecythis, belonging to the same family Lecythidaceae) is soil-dependent and may vary significantly by geographic location. In descending order of concentration, high levels are also found in kidney, tuna, crab, and lobster.A list of selenium-rich foods can be found on The Office of Dietary Supplements Selenium Fact Sheet. The human body's content of selenium is believed to be in the 13–20 milligram range.The most popular web reference for this is . ==Human healthCancer=== \\"Although an inverse association between selenium exposure and the risk of some types of cancer was found in some observational studies, this cannot be taken as evidence of a causal relation, and these results should be interpreted with caution... Conflicting results including inverse, null and direct associations have been reported for some cancer types... RCTs assessing the effects of selenium supplementation on cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results... To date, no convincing evidence suggests that selenium supplements can prevent cancer in humans.\\" ===HIV/AIDS=== AIDS appears to involve a slow and progressive decline in levels of selenium in the body. Whether this decline in selenium levels is a direct result of the replication of HIV or related more generally to the overall malabsorption of nutrients by AIDS patients remains debated. Observational studies have found an association between decreased selenium levels and poorer outcomes in patients with HIV, though these studies were mostly done prior to the currently effective treatments with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Currently there is inadequate evidence to recommend routine selenium supplementation for HIV patients, and further research is recommended. ===Mortality=== Selenium supplementation has no effect on overall mortality. ===Tuberculosis=== As with other types of supplementation, there is no good evidence selenium supplementation helps in the treatment of tuberculosis. ===Diabetes=== A meta-analysis of four RCTs concluded that there is no support for selenium supplementation for prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Caucasians. ===Human reproductive system=== Abnormally high or low levels of dietary selenium can have an adverse effect on sperm quality, with a consequent lowering of fertility. ==Evolution in biology and biosynthetic considerations== Selenium is incorporated into several prokaryotic selenoprotein families in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes as selenocysteine, where selenoprotein peroxiredoxins protect bacterial and eukaryotic cells against oxidative damage. Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells seem to have a bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchin, fish and chicken. Selenium enzymes are involved in utilization of the small reducing molecules glutathione and thioredoxin. Trace elements involved in GSH-Px and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities, i.e. selenium, vanadium, magnesium, copper, and zinc, may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineral-deficient areas. Marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their seleno-proteomes, whereas the seleno-proteomes of some terrestrial organisms were reduced or completely lost. These findings suggest that aquatic life supports selenium utilization, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to reduced use of this trace element. Marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine. From about 500 Mya, freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of \\"new\\" endogenous antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), polyphenols (including flavonoids), tocopherols, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in the last 50–200 million years, in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants. In fact, the angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the late Jurassic period. About 200 Mya, new selenoproteins were developed as mammalian GSH-Px enzymes. ==See also== *ACES (nutritional supplement) *Selenium yeast ==ReferencesExternal links== *WebElements.com – Selenium *National Institutes of Health page on Selenium *Assay *ATSDR – Toxicological Profile: Selenium *Peter van der Krogt elements site Biology Category:Chalcogens Category:Dietary minerals Category:Antioxidants Category:Biology and pharmacology of chemical elements Category:Nutrition ","title":"Selenium in biology"},{"id":"35954460","text":"Founded as the L.G. Balfour Company, Balfour is an operating unit of Commemorative Brands, Inc., a subsidiary of American Achievement Corporation. Balfour produces high school, college, military, and championship rings, yearbooks, caps and gowns, and graduation announcements. ==HistoryFraternity and sorority jewelry=== Lloyd Garfield \\"Bally\\" Balfour was a native of Kentucky, where he earned his B.A. degree at the University of Louisville. He went on to obtain an LL.B. degree from Indiana University, where he became a member of Sigma Chi fraternity in 1907. Business was of greater attraction to Balfour rather than the legal profession, and he spent five years as a traveling representative for a maker of fraternity jewelry. During that time Balfour noticed several trends in the business, including lack of standardization, poor workmanship, inferior materials, and fictitious guarantees. These issues drove Mr. Balfour to establish his own company, and he founded the L.G. Balfour Company on Friday, June 13, 1913. The business grew from a small nucleus of skilled craftsmen led by Mr. Balfour in a facility in Attleboro, Massachusetts. Lloyd Balfour's wives, Ruth who died a few years after they married and Mildred, were members of Pi Beta Phi and the L.G. Balfour Company landed Pi Beta Phi as their first sorority account when the company became the official jeweler after a vote at the 1913 Pi Beta Phi Convention. In the early years, the business was concentrated on quality fraternity and sorority products and the company earned a reputation for quality, integrity, and service. Eventually, Balfour held contracts with ninety percent of all national fraternal societies. ===Product line expansion=== In 1922, Balfour set up a new department to manufacture and sell high school class rings and insignia. In 1923, Balfour introduced the first multi-year contract plans for schools. During World War II, Balfour produced a variety of war-time medals and other products in support of our armed services. Shortly thereafter, Balfour manufactured the first press badge for the Boston Red Sox, beginning forty successive years of making ninety percent of all the baseball World Series press badges. Also, DuPont became the company's first major recognition products account. ===Celestrium=== Celestrium is a trademark of a type of an austenitic stainless steel used in jewelry. It resembles white gold, but is cheaper and more durable. Celestrium is strong, resistant to chemical reaction, and easy to maintain. The same or similar alloys are marketed as white Ultrium, in particular when used for class rings. The trademark rights are owned by Balfour. Celestrium is more malleable than typical stainless steel, which allows it to be engraved, etched and pressed as easily as gold, but its strength and luster preserve the design and shine without tarnishing the way silver does. This chemical composition also means that jewelry fabricated from Celestrium rarely needs cleaning or buffing to retain its brightness. This metal is more cost-effective to process and produce than precious metals are, which keeps costs lower for consumers. One of a number of competitive alternatives to Balfour Celestrium is silverish-looking \\"White Lustrium.\\" Composed of nickel and chromium, this metallic alloy is provided for class rings by the Jostens company. https://www.Leaf.TV/articles/What-is-White-Lustrium/ ===Monopoly charges=== In June 1961, Balfour was accused by the federal government of monopolizing the sale and distribution of fraternity and sorority jewelry and rings. The Federal Trade Commission charged that Balfour \\"unreasonably foreclosed competitors and potential competitors from markets, and employed other illegal practices which have restrained trade.\\" Company president Lloyd Balfour was named in the FTC complaint, along with the Burr, Patterson & Auld Company of Detroit, Michigan. Balfour owned nearly all of the stock in the Detroit-based company. The complaint charged that the two companies had negotiated \\"sole official jeweler\\" contracts with nearly all national Greek-letter organizations, including social organizations, professional organizations, and honor societies. As a result of the exclusive contracts, Balfour controlled 99 percent of jewelry sales to members of those organizations. The complaint also charged Balfour with enticing personnel away from competitors and selling or bidding below cost to drive competitors out of markets.\\"Balfour Accused of Monopolistic Jewelry Practice\\". Lawrence Journal-World. June 26, 1961. p3\\"Charged with Monopoly Over Methods Used to Sell College Rings\\". The Southeast Missourian. June 26, 1961. p2 Balfour ultimately lost its case with the FTC, and its existing insignia contracts were voided in 1968. The FTC required Balfour to issue contracts going forward under new ground rules.\\"Jewelry Concern Loses F.T.C. Case\\". New York Times. August 29, 1968. p51 In the 1970s, Balfour began producing a much wider variety of products for sports champions. When L.G. Balfour died in 1973, the ownership of the company was placed in a trust administered by the Bank of New England. In the late 1970s, Balfour acquired the Norton Facility and Caudle Engraving in Dallas, after which the company's graphics business greatly expanded. Thomas Wyman purchased Balfour in 1983 and opened a new ring plant shortly thereafter. In 1998, Balfour secured a three-year, $20 million corporate recognition program contract with AT&T.; Following the awarding of the large AT&T; contract, Town & Country Corporation purchased Balfour in November 1988. Chelsea, Massachusetts based Town & Country, a maker of fine jewelry and luxury products, planned to continue the operation of all existing Balfour facilities and leave existing Balfour management in place.\\"Chelsea Jewelry Firm to Buy Class Ring-Marker, L.G. Balfour\\". Boston Globe. September 17, 1988. p 12. ===Sale of fraternity division=== In 1994, Balfour sold off its fraternal division, ending its work in the area that was responsible for the birth of the company in 1913. The division, responsible for fraternity and sorority jewelry, was sold to Buddy Cote, a longtime Balfour employee. Many existing fraternal division clients and employees followed Cote to his new business, Legacy Fine Jewelry. Legacy focused on manufacturing badges and pins and outsourced ring production to Balfour. Legacy soon ended its contractual relationship with Balfour due to difficulties between the companies, upon which Legacy turned to Masters of Design, a small firm producing rings, to supply its ring manufacturing needs. The two companies agreed to merge resulting in Legacy Fine Jewelry becoming the Legacy Division of Masters of Design.\\"Maintaining a Legacy\\". To Dragma. Summer 2002. p18. In December 1996, Town & Country Corporation announced its plans to sell its L.G. Balfour division to CJC Holdings, Inc. for approximately $52 million. As part of the deal, Balfour would merge operations with ArtCarved, which was an operating unit of CJC Holdings, Inc. Balfour would close all Attleboro, Massachusetts operations and move 430 jobs from Attleboro to Austin, Texas at ArtCarved's headquarters. Attleboro employees that did not move to Austin were laid off. CJC Holdings, Inc. set up a new company known as Scholastic Brands, Inc. to combine the operations of Balfour and ArtCarved, and the acquisition took effect on December 16, 1996. In 1997, the name of the new parent company was changed from Scholastic Brands, Inc. to Commemorative Brands, Inc. Commemorative Brands changed its name to American Achievement Corporation in June 2000. American Achievement Corporation, is owned by Fenway Partners, a New York-based private equity firm. In 2002, American Achievement Corporation announced the acquisition of the Philadelphia-area firm, Milestone Traditions, a company specializing in the development of exclusive official ring programs. With this acquisition, Balfour, ArtCarved, Taylor Publishing, and Milestone Traditions were all combined under the American Achievement Corporation. American Achievement increased its holdings again in 2004 with the purchase of CB Announcements, a Manhattan, Kansas provider of graduation announcements for the college market. The operations of CB announcements were consolidated with the Balfour operating division. While the L.G. Balfour Company held contracts with ninety percent of all national fraternal organizations, the Balfour brand under the American Achievement Corporation is no longer a maker of fraternity and sorority jewelry. In 2009, the American Achievement Corporation dropped its Taylor Publishing yearbook brand in order to consolidate its yearbook operations under the stronger Balfour brand.http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2010/10/18/american-achievement- corp-raising.html Lloyd Balfour was initiated to the York Rite of Freemasonry, till his elevation to the highest degree of Grand Master. ==Notable products== * 1917-1987 - Official jewelry maker of Alpha Omicron Pi * 1920-1970 - Official jewelry maker of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity * 1932-1968 - Official jewelry maker of the National Society of Pershing Rifles ROTC fraternal organization * 1921-1998 and 2017 - Norwich University Skull and Swords Secret Honor Society, and Skull and Swords Alumni Association. * 1980 Washington Huskies football Rose Bowl Game championship ring * 1982 Penn State Nittany Lions football National Championship ring * 1982 Washington Huskies football Rose Bowl Game championship ring * 1992 Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl ring * 1992 Toronto Blue Jays World Series ring * 1993 Dallas Cowboys Super Bowl ring * 1993 Toronto Blue Jays World Series ring * 1994 New York Rangers Stanley Cup ring * 1994 San Francisco 49ers Super Bowl ring * 1995 Penn State Nittany Lions football Rose Bowl Game championship ring * 2001 New York Yankees World Series ring * 2004 USC Trojans football National Championship ring * 2005 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball National Championship ring * 2005 Texas Longhorns football Rose Bowl Game championship ring * 2006 Texas Longhorns football Alamo Bowl championship ring * 2011 Alabama Crimson Tide BCS National Championship Ring * 2017 UCF Knights football National Championship ring ==References== Category:Design companies established in 1913 Category:Manufacturing companies based in Austin, Texas Category:1913 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1913 ","title":"L.G.

Monastery of La Verne (France). Cloister of the Monastery of Jerez de la Frontera (Spain). The Monastic Family of Bethlehem, of the Assumption of the Virgin and of Saint Bruno (or simply Monks and Sisters of Bethlehem) is a Roman Catholic religious order with Carthusian spirituality founded on November 1, 1950, at Saint Peter's Square, Rome, following the promulgation of the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven, by the inspiration of a small group of French pilgrims.The beginnings of the Monastic Family of Bethlehem, of the Assumption of the Virgin and of Saint Bruno The Monastic Sisters were founded in France, soon after, and the Monastic Brothers in 1976. == Vocation == The vocation of the Monastic Family of Bethlehem, of the Assumption of the Virgin and of Saint Bruno communities consists in listening to the Gospel with the Blessed Virgin Mary in the heart of the Church, in love, in solitude, through liturgical life, study, work and poverty. In order to fulfil this vocation more perfectly, the Monasteries of Bethlehem receive Saint Bruno's fatherhood and his wisdom of life. == Controversies == Since 2015, the monastic family of Bethlehem is the object of a canonical visit led by Fr. Jean Quris, former Deputy Secretary General of the Conference of Bishops of France and by Sister Geneviève Barrière, Benedictine and former abbess of Jouarre, from 2007 to 2014. This visit follows the \\"dysfunctions\\" of certain communities and a lack of distinction between the internal and external fora. == A New Prioress General == Sister EmmanuelNée in 1949 Rose Armelle Marie Claude Lorenchet de Montjamont was named general prioress of the monastic Family of Bethlehem, of the Assumption of the Virgin and of Saint Bruno by the Congregation of Religious, succeeding Sister Isabelle. The Congregation of Religious accepted the resignation of Sister Isabelle, former general prioress, “thanking her for the years of service when she succeeded the founder, Sister Marie, and for her courageous and timely decision to hand over her responsibility in this new stage for her monastic Family.” The Dicastery named a new general prioress, Sister Emmanuel, helped by 5 sisters who are her advisers, and two visitors as apostolic assistants: Father Jean Quris, a priest in the diocese of Angers and an episcopal delegate for consecrated life, and Mother Geneviève Barrière, former Abbess of Jouarre (see above : \\"controversies\\"). The role of the assistants chosen by Rome consists in remaining close to the general prioress and to the permanent advisers in order to cooperate in the implementation of the recommendations given by the Dicastery and of the renewal of the Constitutions, in view of a future general chapter to vote on the constitutions and to elect a general prioress. == Presence in the World == The first community of Monastic Sisters of Bethlehem began in 1951. The first community of Monastic Brothers of Bethlehem (or Monks) was founded in 1976, in the Chartreuse Mountains.

To date, they have released three full-length albums and several EPs. Their most recent LP, New Love, was released on October 2, 2015 through SideOneDummy Records. == Biography == Weiss began playing music as a teenager in their hometown of Flowery Branch, Georgia. Inspired by the emotional tumult of young relationships, they began writing songs, adopting a DIY ethic that would stay with them throughout their career. Weiss released their first EP, An Eight-Song Tribute to Feeling Bad and Feeling Better, in 2007, while attending the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. They followed it up with a full-length concert album, Live at Sidewalk NYC, a year later. In late 2009, Weiss turned to the newly launched Kickstarter crowd- funding platform to try raising the money for their first studio LP, ...Was Right All Along. Their campaign allowed them to reach their funding goal within the first day and triple it just days later. The Kickstarter success led to some high-exposure press, with The New York Times and Wired magazine essentially labeling them as a sort of poster child for the new era of Internet promotion. A.W. capitalized on the attention with countless tours, interviews, and a panelist slot at the industry's SXSW conference in Austin alongside Kickstarter founder Yancey Strickler. They kept themself busy over the next two years by focusing on their songwriting and touring. In 2011, Weiss recorded their second studio album, Say What You Mean, as well as a companion acoustic record called Sideways Sessions in Brooklyn, New York. Both albums were released on No Sleep Records in 2013. The label released an EP titled Remember When the following year. In May 2015, Weiss signed with SideOneDummy Records and announced plans to release a third studio album later that year. New Love was released on October 2, 2015, produced by Forrest Kline of electro-pop band Hellogoodbye and Bradley Hale of indie rock band Now, Now.https://sideonedummy.com/blog/article/allison-weiss-joins-s1d A.W. performing at LoveLoud 2018 In 2017, shortly after the release of their single \\"Runaway,\\" Weiss came out as non-binary, officially changing their project name to A.W. and assuming \\"they/them\\" pronouns. They discussed the transition on the podcast Queery, hosted by comedian Cameron Esposito, for which Weiss also provides the theme music with their song \\"Who We Are.\\" ==Associated acts== During their time in Brooklyn, New York, Weiss frequently played shows with Jenny Owen Youngs, Bess Rogers, Field Mouse, and more.

Palmer's life and artistic endeavors intersected with numerous noteworthy artists throughout her life. She was both inspired by or inspired the likes of dancers Isadora Duncan and Ted Shawn, the French literary great Colette, the poet and author Natalie Barney and the actress Sarah Bernhardt. She would go on to marry Angelos Sikelianos, a Greek poet and playwright. Together they organized a revival of the Delphic Festival in Delphi, Greece. Embodied in these festivals of art, music and theater she hoped to promote a balanced sense of enlightenment that would further the goals of peace and harmony in Greece and beyond. == Early life == Evelina Palmer was born on January 9, 1874 at Gramercy Park in New York City to Courtlandt Palmer Sr. and Catherine Amory Bennett. She was one of five children in a family of eclectic intellectuals and gifted artists. The family she was born into was one that promoted liberal thought, unconventional education and exploration of music, theater and literature. Her earliest memories were of her father's Nineteenth Century Club, whose early meetings were held at the Palmer home.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 5-11.Rodriquez, p. 56. The Nineteenth Century Club brought together people of disparate political ideologies, atheists and religious luminaries. Her father facilitated thoughtful and amiable discussions of politics, religion and morality. These discussions were witnessed by a young Palmer and she would write later they would lay the seeds of her own thoughts as a young woman and adult. Her father died in the summer of 1888 of appendicitis.Palmer-Sikelianos, p. 9. Palmer's mother would later remarry, to a man named Robert Abbe.Palmer-Sikelianos, p. 29. It was during the family's summer vacations at Bar Harbor in Maine she became acquainted with Natalie Barney. The two shared an interest in poetry, literature and horseback riding. Barney likened Palmer to a medieval virgin, an homage to her ankle-length red hair and fair countenance. The two would become young loversRodriquez, pp. 56-58. and later be neighbors in Paris. Palmer's siblings were also formative in her life, in particular her brother Courtlandt Palmer Jr. Her brother was a musical prodigy and could at a young age play at the piano most all of the works of renowned composers.Palmer- Sikelianos, pp. 13-17. As music was integral to their mother's life, all of the Palmer siblings were either exposed to or encouraged to pursue musical endeavors. She herself would go on to study independently, music theory and Greek choral arrangements. Palmer was enrolled in various boarding schools and day schools sporadically and for brief periods of time. Her father established a short-lived experimental school called the Van Taube School. She herself was not enrolled but recalls its open format that encouraged creative minds to explore without a rigid curriculum. After coming of age Palmer would attend Bryn Mawr College. While at Bryn Mawr she studied literature and the theater arts.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 19-27. She left the school before completing a degree, choosing rather to join her brother Palmer Jr. in Rome for a year and to study independently.Palmer-Sikelianos,p. 27. == Paris == Palmer settled in Neuilly, an expatriate neighborhood near Paris.Palmer-Sikelianos, p. 35.Rodriquez, p. 150. Palmer occupied herself fine-tuning her fluency of the French language, attending theater as well as participating in impromptu theatrical performances at fetes in Natalie Barney's backyard garden. At one of these fetes Palmer performed with Colette, Pierre Louÿs' Dialogue au Soleil Couchant.Thurman, p. 155.Palmer-Sikelianos, p. 43.Rodriquez, pp. 154-156. During this time she also met Sarah Bernhardt and the two became acquainted. Palmer was asked to perform with Sarah on-stage, an arrangement that ultimately fell through.Rodriquez, p. 160.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 36-37. During a brief foray in London, Palmer was offered to join the theater company of Mrs. Patrick Campbell. Mrs. Campbell's precondition to Palmer joining the company however demanded that she publicly disassociate herself with Natalie Barney.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 43-45. While the offer pleased Palmer and could have proven fruitful to her artistic endeavors, she ultimately turned down the offer. She was unwilling to forgo her friendship with Barney despite the opportunity. It was also during Palmer's time in Paris she became acquainted with Raymond Duncan, the brother of Isadora Duncan, and his wife Penelope, the sister of Angelos Sikelianos. Due to labor unrest in Paris in 1905, the married couple and their baby came to stay with Palmer at her small house in Neuilly. Palmer and the couple shared an interest in homespun garb and Greek art. With the hopes of reproducing the quality of authentic Greek robes, the trio fashioned a loom to create several garments for themselves. These efforts would ultimately lead Palmer to abandoning traditional dress of the times in favor of dresses and handcrafted leather sandals she would come to fashion herself and wear exclusively. Penelope's singing and reciting of Sikelianos' poetry further intrigued Palmer. She wished to learn more and to meet Sikelianos herself. The Duncans and Palmer would later leave Paris for Greece. == Greece == Palmer and the Duncans would settle for a time in the Grecian foothills of the Hymettos mountains, five miles east of Athens. The location was the unfinished remnants of the Duncan family home. It was here Penelope arranged for Palmer to meet her brother for the first time. Despite the language barrier Palmer and Sikelianos became acquainted, learning they shared a world view. Through their conversations regarding peace, debate and civility, much of it reminded her of her late father's debate society as well as her own formed opinions on the world. It was during this time the seeds for reviving the Delphic Idea and the Delphic Festival was laid. Both Palmer and Sikelianos sought to bring people together and through the devices of art, music and theater share their message of harmony among people of different ethnic, religious and political backgrounds.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 57-66. Palmer followed Sikelianos to Lefkas, the Ionian island on the Western coast of Greece and his ancestral home. Here the two became further acquainted. He shared with her his poetry and they discussed in further depth the Delphic Idea. Palmer had built for her a loom so she could further pursue her interest in weaving homespun dresses in the style of the Greeks.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 67-80. In 1907 Palmer and Sikelianos traveled to America. Palmer was unprepared for the American press interest in her and especially in her chosen mode of dress. As her dress departed from the more typical and Parisian fashions dramatically, the New York newspapers found in Palmer, an heiress of her father's infamous reputation, ample material to write upon. Palmer eschewed the attention and was angered at the often false stories written about her. The purpose of their visit however was to introduce Palmer's mother to Sikelianos and to get married. The couple was married in Bar Harbor, Maine on September 9, 1907.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 81-86. Palmer assumed a hyphenated surname: Eva Palmer-Sikelianos. Her friendship with Barney did not survive this union. Barney feared the loss of Palmer in Sikelianos, while Palmer tired of life in Paris, a lifestyle she increasingly saw as frivolous. Their friendship would later be repaired by an exchange of letters and would later reunite as a friends.Rodriquez, pp. 170-171. Returning to Greece, the couple settled in Athens. Here Palmer gave birth to a son named Glafkos.Palmer- Sikelianos, p. 87. The family also maintained a small residence in Lefkas where they would vacation, explore the beaches and fish. She would also begin studying Greek Ecclesiastical music and notation under Konstantinos Psachos, at the time named by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople as Master Teacher of Music of the Great Church of Christ. Palmer's interest was in the complexity of Greek music as it cannot be recorded in notation in the same fashion as European music. To do so required learning Byzantine music notation. Palmer's scholarly pursuits in music instilled in her a desire to form a school whose purpose would be to preserve Greek indigenous music. Additionally, using her own funds as well as organizing donation drives, she and Psachos would raise the money necessary to commission the creation of a specialized harmonium. The instrument was manufactured by G.F. Steinmeyer in 1924 in Germany and named by Psachos the Evion Panharmonium after its most significant sponsor, Palmer.Wellesz, Velimirović, pp. 85-86.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 93-101. While the original Evion Panharmonium was believed to later be destroyed during World War II, two smaller versions were brought back to Greece by Psachos. Her goal of forming a school of music in Athens was laid to rest while other projects diverted her time and attention. The relationship between Eva and Angelos is described by Takis Dimopoulos, a very close friend of Angelos and person that understood his work, in his article titled \\"The poet and Eva\\" Dimopoulos, initially deals with their relationship as secretly prepared for long and almost predetermined by fate. Angelos (who, at the time he met Palmer was in his prime both spiritually and mentally, “a young bull”, a young Dionysus and fabulous Adonis” from the \\"warm bosom of Mother Earth\\") and Eva, both urged to mate by the poet’s sister Penelope, are considered as two symbols: \\"[...] we have [...] the man, whose bowels are burning with desire for the Eternal female [...] and the woman who, like a crystal interacts with the \\"Male Speech\\" in many levels. [...]. \\"Sikelianos, after their acquaintance, travels to Egypt (where he writes his work “Alafroiskiotos\\" (The Light-Shadowed) and, when he returned to Lefkada, he gets into a relationship with her, which would soon lead to marriage. Eva as the new \\"Homeric Penelope\\", due to the waiting for his return, changes her spiritual targeting and recognizes the priority that a loyal attitude and focus on the vision of the great poet has: she becomes the \\"thirsty receiver\\" of unrestrained \\"bacchic\\" erotic and mystic intoxication, sets aside every obstacle that gets in his way (material or otherwise), guides him and supports him in difficult times (death of Penelope), in a word, she is trying to assure that he will remain undisturbed from anything will could stand in his course. He, in turn, tries to understand the Greek tradition, he knows the \\"great Mystics\\" of all cultures and times and is increasingly developing his \\"innate secretive mood\\" and the \\"first image of Mother Nature\\" in him. This spiritual quest ends with the birth of the Delphic Idea, the new concept for Delphi by Sikelianos. This idea will rush through him in a Dionysian and lyrical way. He wants to change the Present (a political act – in the broader meaning of the term) with “the Love for the Other person” as the means. Eva plays a very important role in this quest and essentially manages to become a “true Greek Bacchant”, she deals with all the organizational, practical and material aspects of the Festivals, allowing Angelos to be devoted to his vision. Her offer, however, is very important (she composes music for the chorus of the tragedies and sews the dresses for the dancers according to ancient Greek standards). Even with such fatigue and responsibility, things are going well and the Festivals (both) are successful. However, the money needed for the conduct of the Delphic Festivals were many and there is need for new resources, so Eva is obliged to return home. Her efforts to find financial resources and partners were long and fruitless and eventually failed. Angelos, influenced by her absence (which resulted in the cancellation of their wedding in 1934 and their separation), turned to another 'first image’\\" of the \\"Mother\\", trying to divert somewhere else his torrential Dionysian vision which is \\"affected\\" by the existential questions that have begun to torture him. This period of \\"existential\\" -almost- loneliness ends in 1938, when he met Anna Karamani, his future wife. Eva had become successively Daughter (the \\"intellectual exercise\\"), Wife (\\"fulfilling the Dionysian visions\\") and Sister, and now had reached the highest stage of this unique development: she became the Mother, who from afar tries to relieve her son of the final course to fulfill the \\"great longing\\", while she is alone and mourning. This is Eva’s role now in relation to Angelos, who asks her consent to his marriage with Anna (she \\"gives her blessings\\"). Ultimately, she turned back to her \\"spiritual home\\", Greece, only when her Dionysus had returned to his Mother, so that she would stay forever in Delphi.Κ. Αθ. Παπαγεωργίου (επιμέλεια), Άγγελος Σικελιανός. Εύα Palmer-Σικελιανού. Δελφικές Εορτές. Ειδικόν αφιέρωμα της επιθεωρήσεως ΗΩΣ. Δεύτερη έκδοση., εκδόσεις Παπαδήμας, Αθήνα 1998, σ. 101 – 107. == First Delphic Festival == The first Delphic Festival organized by Palmer and her husband commenced May 9, 1927.Palmer-Sikelianos, p. 117. Events were planned over the course of several days. These included a production of the Greek tragedy Prometheus Bound, performed amid the ruins of the theater at Delphi, an athletic competition at the stadium, and an assembly of local handicrafts in the nearby village. Preparations for the festival began nearly three years prior and featured both setbacks and unexpected successes. Organizing such an event required time, effort and money. The sponsorship and cooperation of the Greek government, educational institutions, businesses and interest groups was sought. Palmer used both her own inheritance as well as secured loans for the necessary money needed to execute the festival. Along the way she encountered apathy, outright disapproval and sometimes encouragement and support. Palmer's primary task was the production of Prometheus Bound, which involved directing the play, training the Greek chorus, and weaving all of the costumes from scratch.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 108–110. Psachos was recruited to produce the music for the play as she felt only he understood the true nature of the music required to imbue the performance with authenticity. Much to her dismay however Psachos insisted on the inclusion of an accompanying orchestra of musicians. Greek theatrical performances of antiquity did not feature such orchestras nor did the layout of the theater accommodate it. She felt that the theater production necessitated an authentic representation and to deviate from the authenticity would elicit an inaccurate production of the play and the overall message of the Delphic Festival would be marred. Despite her misgivings, the instrumental orchestra was included. To her relief and surprise the accompanying music of the orchestra was largely inaudible given the design of the theater.Palmer- Sikelianos, pp. 115–116. While she did not consider herself the sole source of accuracy and authenticity on Greek tragedy and chorus, she felt she had learned enough on the topics to know that there was no one alive who was. And so she set about the production relying on both her background in these studies as well as by instinct. A feature of the athletic performances was the Pyrrhic Dance, men dressed in armor dancing and keeping time by stomping their feet. Finding enough dedicated men to perform this dance, as well as creating the breastplates, helmets, swords and spears, was a monumental task. Coming to the rescue was the Greek Ministry of War and Alexandros Mazarakis-Ainian, who placed at her disposal all the men she needed for the Pyrrhic Dance as well as tents, trucks, and other supplies needed to carry out the festival.Palmer- Sikelianos, pp. 111–112. The festival concluded successfully. The play and athletic competitions were recorded by the Greek filmmaker Dimitrios Gaziadis. The film was titled Prometheus in Chains and was reproduced in 1971.MacKinnon, pp. 43–48. Press reports throughout Greece and Europe wrote positively of the festival and many previously disposed as skeptical of the idea were convinced otherwise. == Second Delphic Festival == The positive reception of the first festival ensured the cooperation of the Greek government for subsequent festivals. It was decided that a national lottery would be formed to both pay off the debts of the first and pay for the second Delphic Festival. Public support for the festival was high and the government passed the Delphic Lottery bill. At the time Greece had one lottery whose returns were divided between funding the country's archaeological endeavors and to the Greek Navy, but when it came time to print the tickets for the lottery, the effort was stymied. The Minister of the Navy apparently was at blame for the holdup, fearing that funds people spent on lottery tickets would go the festival rather than in support of the Navy.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 121-123. Disillusioned with this setback, Palmer traveled to America for approximately a year. She was asked to lecture at various schools, colleges and universities and wrote several papers on the topics embodied in the festival and the Delphic Idea. Palmer traveled from coast to coast and back again to New England. The lecturing tour afforded only a modest financial return and she largely bore her own travel expenses.Palmer-Sikelianos, p. 124. She was asked to stay on and teach at Yale University the Greek choruses she had directed in Prometheus Bound. She turned down the offer however, feeling she would be unable to teach such things in an authentic and sustaining manner.Palmer- Sikelianos, pp. 124.125. Palmer returned to Europe, staying in Paris for a time before being convinced to return to Greece in the autumn of 1929 and commence the planning of the second Delphic Festival.Palmer-Sikelianos, p. 129. It is unclear if the issue of the Delphic Lottery and the Ministry of the Navy was resolved and how the festival would be paid for; if by the lottery, loans or by Palmer's own money. Her concerns regarding debt still owed from the first festival lend evidence to the unlikelihood she had sufficient funds herself to pay for all the costs of a second festival. Nevertheless she returned to Greece and planning for the second festival began. She and Sikelianos decided on The Suppliants as the featured play.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 125. This play featured the Greek Chorus as the centerpiece and antagonist of the play, and as such she dove into the preparations fully. Fifty chorus performers were needed and unlike the early struggles of the first festival, volunteers were plenty and enthusiastic. The Greek Ministry of War also again provided ready support in men and materials for the festival. The irony of this was not lost on Palmer. Though such an organization was preoccupied with the business of war, the very antithesis of the Delphic Idea, she reasoned who more than any knew the horrors of war than soldiers.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 133, 137-138. Psacos was again asked to write the music for the play and the old arguments from the first festival were revisited. She was given more of a free hand to decide upon the particulars of the production than before and Psachos and Palmer disagreed on the musical elements of the play. The two would not speak again and Psachos withdrew from the production.Palmer- Sikelianos, pp. 134-135. Both the athletic competitions and an exhibition of handicrafts were again part of the festival. The festival took place in 1930 and was a success. Parallel to the Delphic Idea was the idea of a Delphic University, promoted largely by Sikelianos. Following on the success of the two festivals it was hoped such a school could be put together. The Greek government however did not warm to the idea and rather was more interested in how future festivals could promote Greek products and tourism. To Palmer and Sikelianos the festivals were but one means to an end and not the end itself. As such the Greek government was of little help beyond the promotion of the festivals. Tourism and the export of Greek wares could infuse the economy, whereas the studious pursuit of the Delphic Idea would not, in the eyes of the government, garner any returns in the foreseeable future.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 140-142. Palmer would again return to America with hopes of stirring interest in the Delphic Idea and the lessons of Greek Tragedy and Drama. Her marriage with Sikelianos would be annulled in 1934 and he would later remarry in Greece.Palmer-Sikelianos, p. xx. They continued to exchange correspondence and remained on good terms. == America == Palmer renewed her theatrical efforts in America. She was invited to join the Federal Theater Project in New York, a New Deal program to employ out-of-work artists, writers and directors.Palmer-Sikelianos, p. 148. Under this project Palmer endeavored to produce The Persians by Aeschylus, which featured a chorus of fifty men. It was Palmer's desire to produce such a play that featured male dancers and singers, believing that such participation furthered the precepts of the Delphic Idea. Palmer was also involved in the production of a Christmas play, as well as in the writing and production of a comedy based on a Greek play by Aristophanes. None of these efforts however came to fruition. The competing agendas and in-fighting between committees and sub-committees of the Federal Theater Project, as well as an uneven participation and dedication by a motley crew of tap-dancers, vaudeville stars and circus performers she was given to work with, undermined Palmer's efforts. She was eventually dismissed from the program.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 148-150. Frustrated and disappointed, Palmer moved on. In the spring of 1938 she would give a lecture to a Greek society group called Philiko where she announced her intention on teaching The Persians. Participation was limited to four interested individuals.Palmer- Sikelianos, p. 151. Not long after Palmer developed a severe condition of pneumonia and was interred in bed for an extended period of time. This was a time of rest and introspection for Palmer. She maintained correspondence with her various friends and family, read and wrote until she recovered and was well enough again to pursue more active interests. For a time Palmer would stay with a friend in Greenwich, Connecticut.Palmer-Sikelianos, p. 191. In January 1939, Palmer took in a dance production at Irving Washington High School in New York, Dance of Ages by Ted Shawn and his company of male dancers.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 200-201. Her previous experiences with male dancers of this sort had not been positive. They were either entrenched in American style of dancing or unwilling to learn the Greek chorus methods. What she witnessed in Shawn and his production was akin to the style and spirit of what she sought. Shawn was familiar with Palmer's efforts and the two agreed to make time to discuss their particular endeavors. They quickly found they shared an understanding of dance and music. The two would collaborate the following years. Palmer would teach Shawn's dance troupe her interpretation of Greek chorus as well as produce costumes from her loom.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 203-204, 207-208. In Shawn's group of dancers she found at long last a rapt audience and interested students. Shawn and Palmer would go on to produce several numbers that were seen in New York and Florida. Later they would arrive at an impasse and artistic disagreement that ultimately led to the end of their partnership.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 212-214. == Upward Panic == Upward Panic is both the title of Palmer's autobiography and a term she coined herself. The autobiography was assembled and edited by John P. Anton, Professor of Greek Philosophy and Culture at the University of South Florida. The autobiography is the fourth volume in a series of books that make up the Choreography and Dance Studies program and published by Harwood Academic Publishers in 1993. Professor Anton received a grant in 1985 which allowed him to travel to Greece and research what could be learned of Palmer there. She began writing her autobiography in 1938 and would continue to do so on and off again through 1948. The book is roughly divided into two parts, the first being more traditionally autobiographical where she speaks to her early life and family. The second half concerns accounts of the Delphic Festivals, her later experiences in America and theoretical essays.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. xi- xxv. Upward Panic as a term coined by Palmer describes the rising exhilaration experienced at the culmination of tragic drama, music and dance. She and Sikelianos believed that the pursuit of these arts would lead people towards peace and understanding of each other.Palmer-Sikelianos, pp. 238-240. The term itself has its roots in Arcadia, Greek Mythology and of Pan, from which the English word 'panic' is derived from. Use of the word panic in this context should not be confused with the negative connotation it holds in modern English. == Death and legacy == Palmer returned to Greece in the spring of 1952. Two weeks after her arrival she suffered a fatal stroke while attending a theatrical performance in Delphi. She was 78 years old. Pursuant to her wishes she was buried at Delphi.Palmer-Sikelianos, p. xxi. Palmer's artistic endeavors and support of the Delphic Idea came in a period of time between world wars. In her latter years she would witness from afar the rise of Nazism, Hitler and WWII. It would seem as though their efforts had been all for naught. They were not the first to attempt a revival of the spirit of Delphi in Greece and they would not be the last. The Delphic Idea lives on in modern times through the International Delphic Council. Much of the same ideals and principals are embodied in these modern efforts of music, dance and athletics. == Notes  References == * Angelos Sikelianos, Letters to Eva Palmer Sikelianos, Edited by Kostas Bournazakis, Ikaros Publisher, Athens 2008 * Eva Palmer Sikelianos, Upward Panic – The Autobiography of Eva Palmer- Sikelianos, Edited By John P.

It is written by Eliza Clark and directed by Nicole Kassell. In the episode, Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) finds herself in a psychiatric ward, while Stephen Holder (Joel Kinnaman) continues the investigation. Stan Larsen (Brent Sexton) attempts to repair the damage that his past actions have caused. Darren Richmond (Billy Campbell) returns to the Seattle All Stars basketball program. ==Plot== Linden wakes up in a hospital bed with an identification bracelet on her wrist. She walks down the hall, tries to open a locked door—which bears a sign outside: \\"Psychiatry Acute Ward\\". In the waiting room, Lt. Carlson (Mark Moses) tells Holder that Linden attacked a casino worker while trying to kill herself. Holder says the tribe is hiding evidence and informs him that the Larsen case files disappeared on the way to county police. Linden tries to call Holder from a nursing station but is told the phone is only available during certain hours. She learns she is on suicide watch for 72 hours. At the Larsen home, Stan apologizes to Terry (Jamie Anne Allman), who says the case may never be solved, that he is angry because he cannot let go, and suggests he fix what he can. Stan later approaches Amber (Ashley Johnson) and Bennet (Brandon Jay McLaren) Ahmed at their front door. He admits to them that he was wrong, that Rosie cared for Bennett, and that she came to say goodbye that night. Bennet threatens to call the police unless Stan leaves. Amber later walks out her front door and turns on the porch light, realizing Stan has fixed it. A crying Stan later calls Rosie's phone and leaves a message, apologizing for never telling her that he was not her biological father. He then surprises Terry and the boys with a bulldog. At the marina, Holder asks Regi (Annie Corley) to help get Linden released from the hospital. She says that only Linden's psychiatrist can do so. She also mentions that she has seen what happens to Linden when she neglects everything else in her life, and that is how it started \\"last time\\". Holder notices a Mayor Adams billboard at the waterfront construction site and notes Michael Ames is the project manager. He calls police technician Ray (Randall Edwards) at the station, who researches and tells him that a man was arrested and then released after breaking into the site on the night of Rosie's murder. Linden meets with a psychiatrist, Dr. Ann Kerry (Janet Kidder), who says Linden may leave the hospital early if she cooperates. Kerry suggests they discuss the prior murder case that previously sent Linden to the psychiatry ward. Linden tells her about that case, during which she found a six-year-old boy in an apartment with his mother's decomposing body. The boy, who continuously drew pictures of trees, ended up in foster care. Linden discusses both murder cases with the doctor, suggesting that both victims were \\"trying to tell her something\\". The doctor asks why the two cases mean so much, but Linden quietens, demands to leave, and struggles against two orderlies who come in to restrain her. At a Seattle All Stars basketball event, Jamie Wright (Eric Ladin) argues they should be courting votes they do not already have, but Gwen Eaton (Kristin Lehman) reassures Richmond to campaign for what feels genuine. Richmond shoots some baskets from his wheelchair, while a man behind Gwen videotapes the event. Later in the office, Jamie finds a cufflink with the city seal, shows it to Richmond and says Gwen closed the office the night before. They both wonder why she would be meeting with the mayor. At the waterfront, an officer (Alex Zahara) tells Holder he arrested a man named Joseph Nowak for breaking into the construction site on the night of Rosie's murder, but that Ames did not press charges against Nowak. The officer adds that Nowak's reason for the break-in was not construction related, noting that Nowak works for Janek Kovarsky. Holder meets with Linden during visiting hours and briefs her on the latest developments in the case. Dazed, Linden keeps mentioning the City Hall keycard that she saw on the casino's tenth floor. Holder vows to get her out. He then finds Joseph Nowak (Brad Kelly) at a lumber yard and chases him down, demanding to know about the waterfront activity that night. Holder meets Carlson to tell him \\"all our players\\" are involved in the murder: Nowak was at the mayor's construction site to bury native-American bones, and his arrest prompted a meeting between Ames, Chief Jackson and Mayor Adams. Rosie saw the meeting and was killed. Holder demands Carlson give him Linden's psychiatrist's contact information. Gwen tells Richmond that a video from his All Stars appearance has become a viral online hit. He asks why she met with Mayor Adams and she says she planned to blackmail him about kissing her when she was underage. Richmond comforts her. She later hands a man an envelope out her car window, congratulating him on his work on the video. Talking with Dr. Kerry, Linden expresses doubts about the father's arrest in the previous murder. Kerry mentions Linden's mother, who abandoned her at age five, and Linden insists she is fine. Kerry points out that her son is gone and she was supposed to be married a few days ago. A hospital worker interrupts to say Linden is being released. In the waiting room, Linden's ex-fiancé (Callum Keith Rennie), Dr. Rick Felder, who is Linden's psychiatrist, tells Holder he will release Sarah, but cannot be involved any further. Linden sees Rick from an adjacent room, but he quickly leaves. Holder drives while Sarah sleeps in the passenger seat. At the casino, Chief Jackson (Claudia Ferri) tells someone on her phone that the police will never find anything. Roberta Drays (Patti Kim) monitors a construction crew resuming work on the tenth-floor room. The blood-stained City Hall keycard lies unnoticed under the floorboards. ==ReceptionCritical reception=== \\"72 Hours\\" received mostly positive reviews. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars, calling it \\"another quiet episode, but The Killing does them with such a tenacity that even those still and silent moments scream as loud as can be.\\" The A.V. Club's Brandon Nowalk rated this episode a B-, saying \\"'72 Hours' feels caught between what The Killing was and what it has recently become, which is admittedly a false dichotomy. There's an obviousness, though, that can't entirely be chalked up to pulp's habit of sorting characters into situational conventions.\\" William Bibbiani of CraveOnline called \\"72 Hours\\" a \\"filler episode, disguised as something more\\". He added, \\"It could have worked out, but besides the revelation that Linden was engaged to her old psychiatrist, which raises a few questions that have nothing to do with the main storyline, it gives us nothing new besides a connection between several of the key suspects, which could have been integrated into just about any episode of the series.\\" ===Ratings=== The episode was watched by 1.31 million viewers and received an adult 18-49 rating of 0.3, one-tenth lower than the previous episode. == References External links== *\\"72 Hours\\" at AMC * * Category:The Killing (American TV series) episodes Category:2012 American television episodes ","title":"72 Hours (The Killing)"},{"id":"35954890","text":"Oslin may refer to: *OSLIN PIANO The First Malaysia Piano.

Renamed D.VI in September, two were completed early in 1919, after the Armistice with Germany. In plan the wing of the D.VI was more complicated than most, with the chord narrowest in the centre section, increasing outwards then decreasing somewhat towards the wing tips from about mid-span. Most of the curvature was on the trailing edge, assisting the pilot's vision from his cockpit there. The wing thickness also varied along the span, thinnest in the centre then increasing and decreasing again. The wing carried overhung, balanced ailerons and was braced with a pair of slightly converging, outward leaning struts to the thickest part of the wing from the lower fuselage. Its centre section was supported by a pair of short, vertical N-form cabane struts from the upper fuselage. The fuselage of the D.VI was circular in cross-section, with its 11-cylinder, Siemens-Halske Sh.IIIa rotary engine completely cowled in the nose driving a four blade propeller. The fuselage diameter decreased markedly to the tail but an unusual jettisonable fuel tank bulged out below for about 35% of the overall length. The blunt delta shaped tailplane was mounted at mid-fuselage height and had a single balanced elevator. The fin was small, with a generous, balanced, swept back, blunt topped rudder. The fighter had a simple, fixed conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on a single axle supported by wire braced V-struts to the lower fuselage. Its tall tailskid was faired aft forming a little ventral fin. The D.VI was test flown between February and May 1919 with promising speed and climb rates, though one of the two prototypes was lost. The other was reputedly destroyed by the Siemens- Schuckert staff to prevent its acquisition by the Aeronautical Inter-Allied Commission of Control, that began work in 1918. ==SpecificationsReferences== Category:Parasol-wing aircraft Category:1910s German fighter aircraft D.VI Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1919 Category:Rotary-engined aircraft ","title":"Siemens-Schuckert D.VI"},{"id":"35955018","text":" The Siemens-Schuckert DDr.I was a World War I German twin engine, push- pull configuration triplane fighter aircraft. Only one was built, crashing on its first flight. ==Design and development== The unusual DDr.I was one of the first aircraft to have two engines on the same centre line, one in tractor configuration and the other a pusher, an arrangement usually known as tandem push-pull. It was a triplane with constant chord, straight edged, square tipped wings of equal span and marked stagger. These were divided into two bays by pairs of near-parallel interplane struts. The upper wing was braced over the fuselage with a pair of N-form struts, leaning inward from the upper fuselage to common mountings on the wing centre line. The middle wing of the triplane was positioned at shoulder height on the fuselage and the lower wing passed unbraced below. There were short span ailerons on each wing. The smoothly faired and contoured short fuselage of the DDr.I positioned the open pilot's cockpit between two Siemens-Halske Sh.I nine cylinder rotary engines, one with a two blade tractor propeller and the other driving a four blade pusher turning just aft of the lower wing trailing edge. The empennage was mounted on four longitudinal, tubular outrigger beams, braced with vertical and transverse members. There were no fixed rear surfaces; the single piece, constant chord elevator reached between the two upper beams and a pair of similarly shaped rudder went from the upper to the lower beams, hinged further aft than the elevator but with their lower ends on a hinged frame that moved with it. The DDr.I had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with its mainwheels on a single axle mounted on wide spread V-struts attached to the lower fuselage at the lower corner points of each engine's firewall. Engine control problems and a lack of stability experienced in the first flight, made on 9 November 1917, led to a crash; the aircraft was not rebuilt and plans for a more powerful version, the DDr.II, powered by two , Siemens-Halske Sh.III eleven cylinder rotary engines were abandoned. ==Specifications== 300x300px ==References== Category:Triplanes Category:Twin-engined push-pull aircraft Category:1910s German fighter aircraft DDr.I Category:Aircraft first flown in 1917 Category:Rotary-engined aircraft ","title":"Siemens-Schuckert DDr.I"},{"id":"35955027","text":"The 2012 Missouri Valley Conference Baseball Tournament took place from May 22–26.

The river tumbles down an irregular series of rocky steps. The waterfalls mark the furthest point from the mouth of the river that can be reached by boat. In 2009 work started on the construction of the Félou Hydroelectric Plant, a run-of-the-river hydroelectric plant at the falls replacing a small 600 kW plant dating from the 1920s. ==Historical significance== The falls were historically important as they were the furthest point up the Sénégal River from Saint Louis that could be reached by boat. Because of the seasonal variation in the water level, navigation up to the falls was only possible for a few months after the rainy season. French forces made use of the river in their conquest of the Sudan in the 19th century. In 1855 Louis Faidherbe, the French governor of Sénégal, constructed a fort at the village of Médine, 3 km downstream of the falls, to strengthen French control of the Sénégal River and to act a base in the expansion into the interior. At the present time, only very limited use is made of the river for the transport of goods and passengers. Several studies have looked at the feasibility of creating a navigable channel in width between the small town of Ambidédi in Mali and Saint-Louis in Senegal, a distance of . It would give landlocked Mali a direct route to the Atlantic Ocean.. ==Félou and the Sénégal River== The Sénégal River is formed by the confluence of the Bakoye and Bafing rivers 82 km upstreamDistances are \\"as- the-crow-flies\\" and do not take account of the meanders of the river. of the Félou Falls near the town of Bafoulabé. Both the Bakoye and the Bafing rivers have their headwaters in the Fouta Djallon highlands in Guinea which receive heavy rainfall between June and October during the West African Monsoon. Over the period 1903-1980, of the water arriving at Félou each year, 13 km3 came from the Bafing, 4.6 km3 from the Bakoye and 2.6 km3 from the basin downstream of Bafoulabé.. The amount of water in the river during this period was highly seasonal with the highest flow rate in September and almost no flow between January and June.. There were also large year-to-year variations in the flow. In 1987, the Manantali Dam was completed on the Bafing, 90 km upstream of Bafoulabé and 200 km upstream of Félou. The dam retains 11.3 km3 of water which is used to generate electricity during the dry season. As a result, the intensity of the maximum flood downstream of the dam has been reduced but during the dry season a flow of between 150 m3/s and 200 m3/s is maintained.. ==Hydroelectric plant== View on the hydroelectric plant of Félou in 2014 In the 1920s the French colonial government constructed a weir and a small run- of-the-river hydroelectric plant at the Félou falls which was updated in 1992.

Originally an umbrella organization for different Christian parties, the Lebanese Forces later became a separate organization. It was mainly staffed by Maronite Christians. The Lebanese Front was informally organized in January 1976 under the leadership of Pierre Gemayel and Camille Chamoun. It began as a simple coordination or joint command between the predominantly Christian Kataeb Party/Kataeb Regulatory Forces (KRF), Tyous Team of Commandos (TTC), Ahrar/Tigers Militia, Al-Tanzim, Marada Brigade and Lebanese Renewal Party/Guardians of the Cedars (GoC) parties and their respective military wings. The main reason behind the formation of the Lebanese Front was to strengthen the Christian side against the challenge presented by the Lebanese National Movement (LNM), an umbrella alliance of leftist Muslim parties/militias backed by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Rejectionist Front Palestinian guerrilla factions. ==The Golden Years (1976-1982)== Christian East Beirut was ringed by heavily fortified Palestinian camps and East Beirut became besieged by the PLO camps. This situation was remedied by the Kataeb Regulatory Forces (most notably the BG Squad that was led by Bachir) and their allied Christian militias as they besieged the Palestinian camps embedded in Christian East Beirut one at a time and brought them down. The first was on 18 January 1976 when the heavily fortified Karantina camp, located near the strategic Beirut Harbor, was invaded: About 1,000 PLO fighters and civilians were killed.Harris (p. 162) notes \\"the massacre of 1,500 Palestinians, Shi'is, and others in Karantina and Maslakh, and the revenge killings of hundreds of Christians in Damur\\" The Palestinian PLO and al-Saiqa forces retaliated by attacking the isolated defenseless Christian town of Damour about 20 miles south of Beirut on the coast, during the Damour massacre in which 1,000 Christian civilians were killed and 5,000 were sent fleeing north by boat, since all roads were blocked off. The Maronites retaliated with the invasion of the largest and strongest Palestinian refugee camp, Tel al-Zaatar that same year. Bachir, with his KRF militia units, also fought against the PLO and LNM militias at the Battle of the Hotels in central Beirut. The most important battle won by the Phalange for the control of the hotel district was the fighting over the possession of the Holiday Inn, due to its important strategic location. Before that battle, the Holiday Inn had been occupied by the PLO. The Lebanese Forces was soon after established with an agreement that the direct military commander would be a Kataeb member and the vice-commander an Ahrar member. Bachir led his troops in the infamous Hundred Days War in Lebanon in 1978, in which the Lebanese Forces successfully resisted the Syrian shelling and attacking of Eastern Beirut for about three months before an Arab-brokered agreement forced the Syrians to end the siege. Syrians took high buildings such as Burj Rizk Achrafieh and Burj El Murr using snipers and heavy weapons against civilians. The soldiers stayed for 90 days. Another major clash took place near the Sodeco area in Achrafieh where the Lebanese Forces fought ferociously and led the Syrian army out of the Rizk Building. At this time, Israel was the primary backer of the Lebanese Front's militia. In July 1980, following months of intra-Christian clashes between the Tigers, the militia of Dany, and the Phalangists, who by now were under the complete leadership of Bachir Gemayel, the Phalangists launched an operation in an attempt to stop the clashes within the Christian areas, and to unite all the Christian militias under Gemayel's command. This operation resulted in a massacre of tens of Tigers' members at the Marine beach resort in Safra, 25 km north of Beirut. Camille Chamoun's silence was interpreted as acceptance of Gemayel's controls, because he felt that the Tigers led by his son were getting out of his control. In 1981 at Zahlé in the Beqaa, the largest Christian town in the East, confronted one of the biggest battles – both military and political – between the Lebanese Forces and the Syrian occupying forces. The Lebanese Forces was able to confront them even though there was a big mismatch in military capabilities and was able to reverse the result of the battle of 1981. This victory was due to the bravery of the inhabitants and 92 Lebanese Forces soldiers (L.F Special Forces: The Maghaweer) sent from Beirut. The Syrian occupying forces used all kind of weapons (heavy artillery, tanks, war planes…) against the town, and they cut all kind of backup that may come from the Mountain. Regardless of the very bad weather and heavy bombing, convoys were sent in the snow to Zahle. Two Lebanese Forces soldiers died on a hill due to bad weather, they were found later holding each other till they died (Fouad Nammour and George Nakhle). The battle of Zahle gave the Lebanese Cause a new perspective in the International Communities, and the victory was both military and diplomatic. It made the Leadership of President Bashir Gemayel much stronger because of his leadership and important role in this battle. The battle started in April the 2nd 1981, and finished with a cease fire and Lebanese Police were sent to Zahle. The 92 Lebanese Forces heroes returned to Beirut on 1 July 1981. ===Israeli invasion=== In 1982, Bachir met with Hani Al-Hassan (representative of the PLO) and told him that Israel will enter and wipe them out. Bachir told him to leave Lebanon peacefully before it's too late. Hani left and no reply was given to Bachir.قصة الموارنة في الحرب - جوزيف أبو خليل Israel invaded Lebanon, arguing that a military intervention was necessary in order to root out PLO guerrillas from the southern part of the country. Israeli forces eventually moved towards Beirut and laid siege to the city, aiming to reshape the Lebanese political landscape and force the PLO out of Lebanon. By 1982, Israel had been the main supplier to the Lebanese Forces, giving them assistance in weapons, clothing, and training. An official Israeli inquiry into the events in Beirut estimated that when it was fully mobilized, the Phalange had 5000 fighters, of which 2000 were full-time.Kahan, Yitzhak, Barak, Aharon, Efrat, Yona (1983) The Commission of Inquiry into events at the refugee camps in Beirut 1983 FINAL REPORT (Authorized translation) p.108 has \\"This report was signed on 7 February 1982.\\" p7 After the PLO had been expelled from the country and moved its headquarters to Tunisia, in a negotiated agreement, Bachir Gemayel became the youngest man to ever be elected president of Lebanon. He was elected by the parliament in August; most Muslim members of parliament boycotted the vote. On September 3, 1982, during the meeting, Begin demanded that Bachir sign a peace treaty with Israel as soon as he took office in return for Israel's earlier support of Lebanese Forces and he also told Bachir that the IDF would stay in South Lebanon if the Peace Treaty was not directly signed. Bachir was furious with Begin and told him that the Lebanese Forces did not fight for seven years and he also told Begin that they did not sacrifice thousands of soldiers to free Lebanon from the Syrian Army and the PLO so that Israel could take their place. The meeting ended in rage and both sides were not happy with each other.تاريخ في رجل ---> من قتل بشير - إنقلاب بشيري أم إنقلاب إسرائيلي Begin was reportedly angry with Bachir for his public denial of Israel's support. Bachir refused to accept the offer of immediate peace by arguing that time was needed to reach a consensus with the Lebanese Muslims and the Arab nations. Bachir was quoted telling David Kimche, the director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, a few days earlier, \\"Please tell your people to be patient. I am committed to make peace with Israel, and I shall do it. But I need time – nine months, maximum one year. I need to mend my fences with the Arab countries, especially with Saudi Arabia, so that Lebanon can once again play its central role in the economy of the Middle East.\\"President Reagan and the World by Eric J. Schmertz, Natalie Datlof, Alexej Ugrinsky, Hofstra UniversitySpecial to the New York Times (1982-09-04). \\"Begin Said to Meet in Secret With Beirut's President-Elect\\". The New York Times. \\"Begin Said to Meet in Secret With Beirut's President- Elect\\" In an attempt to fix the relationship between Bachir and Begin, Ariel Sharon held a secret meeting with Bachir in Bikfaya. In this meeting, they both agreed that, after 48 hours, the IDF would cooperate with the Lebanese Army in order to force the Syrian Army out of Lebanon. After that was done, the IDF would peacefully leave Lebanese territory. Concerning the Peace Negotiations, Sharon agreed to give Bachir time to resolve the internal conflicts before signing the negotiations. The next day, Begin's office issued a statement which said that the issues which Bachir and Sharon had agreed upon were accepted.أسرار الحرب في لبنان Nine days before he was to take office, on September 14, 1982, Bachir was killed along with 25 others when a bomb exploded in the Kataeb headquarters in Achrafieh. The attack was carried out by Habib Shartouni, a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), believed by many to have acted on instructions of the Syrian government of President Hafez al-Assad. The next day, Israel moved to occupy the city, allowing Phalangist members under Elie Hobeika's command to enter the centrally located Sabra and the Shatila refugee camp; a massacre followed, in which Phalangists killed between 762-3,500 (number is disputed) civilians, mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites, causing great international uproar. == The Amine Gemayel years (1982–1988) Battles=== Mountain War After the Israeli invasion, the IDF troops settled in the Chouf and Aley from party militias, the Lebanese Forces returned to the Christian villages which had been occupied by the PSP for seven years, and many Christian civilians from the districts returned after having fled earlier in the war. However, soon after, clashes broke out between the Lebanese Forces and the Druze militias who had now taken over the districts and had earlier kicked out the Christian inhabitants. The main Druze militiamen came from the Progressive Socialist Party, led by Walid Jumblatt, in alliance with the Syrian Army and Palestinian militants who had not departed Lebanon in 1982. For months, the two fought what would later be known as the \\"Mountain War.\\" At the peak of the battle, Israeli troops infamously abandoned the area, handing the best tactical positions over to the Druze militias and their allies as punishment for the Christians' refusal to sign the May 17 peace agreement with Israel, and leaving the Christian forces to fight. At the same time, a small number of ill-equipped Lebanese Forces troops also fought battles against the Palestinian and Druze militias and the Syrian troop east of the southern city of Sidon. The outcome was also a Progressive Socialist Party victory and a contiguous Druze Chouf district with access to Lebanese sea ports. Jumblatt's militia then overstepped itself by advancing further into Souk El Gharb, a village also held by the lebanese forces. After fierce battles and severe casualties the attackers were pushed back. However, the Lebanese Forces eventually handed over their positions in Souk el Gharb to the Lebanese army which had great interests in defending the town due to the strategic importance it holds for the army and the Lebanese government as the town lays on the flanks of the Ministry of Defense and the Presidential Palace. After the retreat, the Lebanese Forces freed up more than 2,500 fighters including elite units to fight on other fronts. ===Internal power struggles=== After the death of Bachir, his brother Amine Gemayel replaced him as President, and his cousin, Fadi Frem as commander of the Lebanese Forces. The two had a frosty relationship, and in 1984, pressure from Amine led to Frem's replacement by Fouad Abou Nader. On March 12, 1985, Samir Geagea, Elie Hobeika and Karim Pakradouni rebelled against Abou Nader's command, ostensibly to take the Lebanese Forces back to its original path. The relationship between Geagea and Hobeika soon broke down, however, and Hobeika began secret negotiations with the Syrians. On December 28, 1985, he signed the Tripartite Accord, against the wishes of Geagea and most of the other leading Christian figures. Claiming that the Tripartite Accord gave Syria unlimited power in Lebanon, Geagea mobilized factions inside the Lebanese Forces and on January 15, 1986, attacked Hobeika's headquarters in Karantina. Hobeika surrendered and fled, first to Paris and subsequently to Damascus, Syria. He then moved to Zahlé with tens of his fighters where he prepared for an attack against East Beirut. On September 27, 1986, Hobeika's forces tried to take over the Achrafieh neighborhood of Beirut but the Lebanese Forces of Geagea's command held them back. This failed attempt by Hobeika was the last episode of internal struggles in East Beirut during Amine Gemayel's mandate. As a result, the Lebanese Forces led by Geagea were the only major force on ground. During two years of frail peace, Geagea launched a drive to re-equip and reorganize the Lebanese Forces. He also instituted a social welfare program in areas controlled by Geagea's party. The Lebanese Forces also cut its relations with Israel and emphasized relations with the Arab states, mainly Iraq but also Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt. == The Elimination War (1988–1990) == Two rival governments contended for recognition following Amine Gemayel's departure from the Presidency in September 1988, one a mainly Christian government and the other a government of Muslims and Lebanese Leftists. The Lebanese Forces initially supported the military Christian government led by Gen. Michel Aoun, the commander of the Lebanese Army. However, clashes erupted between the Lebanese Forces and the Lebanese Army under the control of Michel Aoun on February 14, 1989. These clashes were stopped, and after a meeting in Bkerké, the Lebanese Forces handed the national ports which it controlled to Aoun's government under pressure from the Lebanese National army. Geagea initially supported Aoun's \\"Liberation War\\" against the Syrian army, but then agreed to the Taif Agreement, which was signed by the Lebanese deputies on 24 October 1989 in Saudi Arabia and demanded an immediate ceasefire. Aoun's main objection to the Taif Agreement was its vagueness as to Syrian withdrawal from the country. He rejected it vowing that he \\"would not sign over the country.\\" Fierce fighting in East Beirut broke out between the two, called the \\"Elimination War\\" on January 31, 1990. == Territory Handover to the LAF == On the 1st April 1990, following an agreement between Geagea and Hrawi, General Elie Hayek (who had been appointed commander of the Mount Lebanon governorate two weeks prior)https://www.facebook.com/GeneralHayek/photos/pb.2210586005936595.-2207520000../2210596455935550/?type=3&theater; was mandated by the executive to begin the transfer of military and political administrations in the Christian enclave from the LF to the West Beirut government.https://archive.org/stream/ArabTimes1990KuwaitEnglish/Apr%2012%201990%2C%20Arab%20Times%2C%20%237842%2C%20Kuwait%20%28en%29_djvu.txt The territories in the Christian North Governorate and East Beirut would still remain under complete LF control, in addition to the 30000 reservist 10000 active men strong militia remain intact for the moment. In response, Aoun announced that he would not accept any alliance between the two, and transferring the regions of the Metn was thus impossible due to the raging Elimination War.https://civilsociety-centre.org/sir/both-sides-pounded- christian-enclave-daily-claiming-lives-615-people-died-and-more-2000-were To further demonstrate his commitment to Taif and willingness to extend civilian administration in “Marounistan”, Geagea placed Hayek’s bureau at the LF HQ in Jounieh.https://www.lorientlejour.com/article/223734/Le_proces_dans_laffaire_Murr_prendra_fin_lundi_avec_les_plaidoieries_de_Karam_et_du_chef_des_FL_Naim_qualifie_dillegale_la_procedure_judiciaire_et_Riz.html Following the defeat and surrender of Aoun at Baabda on the 13th October 1990, the LAF under Hayek’s command began extending its influence South into the Metn and Baabda. On the 30 April 1991 – final date imposed by the government for the total surrender of weapons and heavy artillery – all LF areas were ceded to the army command for the first time since 1975. == The Second Republic (1990–2005) == After Aoun surrendered on 13 October 1990 to the rival Syrian-backed President Hrawi, Geagea was offered ministerial posts in the new government. He refused several times, because he was opposed to Syrian interference in Lebanese affairs, and his relationship with the new government deteriorated. On March 23, 1994, the Lebanese government headed by Rafic Hariri ordered the dissolution of the LF.Lebanon Detains Christian in Church Blast. New York Times, March 24, 1994. Retrieved on 2008-02-13. On April 21, 1994, Geagea was arrested on charges of setting a bomb in a church at Zouk Mikael, of instigating acts of violence, and of committing assassinations during the Lebanese Civil War. Although he was acquitted of the first charge, Geagea was subsequently arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment on several different counts, including the assassination of former Prime Minister Rashid Karami in 1987. He was incarcerated in solitary confinement, with his access to the outside world severely restricted. Amnesty International criticized the conduct of the trials and demanded Geagea's release, and Geagea's supporters argued that the Syrian-controlled Lebanese government had used the alleged crimes as a pretext for jailing Geagea and banning an anti-Syrian party. Many members of the Lebanese Forces were arrested and brutally tortured in the period of 1993-1994. At least one died in Syrian custody and many others were severely injured.UN Commission on Human Rights – Torture – Special Rapporteur's Report.

Inevitably, this hodgepodge of different models of assault rifles and carbines in service seriously strained the LF's own supply chain, so the LF Command decided after 1986 to simplify its small-arms inventory by standardizing on the FN FAL, M16A1, and AKM assault rifles for its infantry units, though this still posed logistical problems up to the end of the War.Micheletti and Debay, Liban – dix jours aux cœur des combats (1989), p. 36.

Several student pilots were sent to Iraq and other countries to attend helicopter pilot courses, and later on the LF received from Iraq three Aérospatiale SA-342L Gazelle helicopter gunships. The program was eventually interrupted, then canceled when the Elimination War broke out in 1990. It is not clear if any of the Gazelles were actually delivered by the Iraqis prior to the end of the civil war in October 1990, although it has being reported that the LF illegally sold three helicopters of this same type to Serbia in 1991. == See also == *Al-Tanzim *Bashir Gemayel *East Beirut canton *Ehden massacre *Guardians of the Cedars *Hundred Days' War *Kataeb Party *Kataeb Regulatory Forces *January 1986 Lebanese Forces coup *Lebanese Civil War *Lebanese Front *Lebanese Forces – Executive Command *Lebanese National Movement *Lebanese Youth Movement *Marada Brigade *Mountain War *Sabra and Shatila Massacre *Tigers Militia *Tyous Team of Commandos *People's Liberation Army (Lebanon) *Young Men (Lebanon) *Weapons of the Lebanese Civil War *Zahliote Group *4th Infantry Brigade (Lebanon) *9th Infantry Brigade (Lebanon) == Notes == #أحزاب سياسية في لبنان ==References== * Alain Menargues, Les Secrets de la guerre du Liban: Du coup d'état de Béchir Gémayel aux massacres des camps palestiniens, Albin Michel, Paris 2004.

The theory states that the effects of use of weapons on health have certain identifiable determinants: *the victim's vulnerability; *the type of weapon or weapons used; *the potential number of weapons in use; *the psychological aspect of how the violence is perpetrated. While teaching a course at the Harvard School of Public Health (2003), Coupland began collaborating with Taback, a statistician with an interest in global health. Their collaboration involved refining Coupland's original theory and developing the means to make quantifiable the various determinants for a given outcome of armed violence. The result has come to be known as the Taback-Coupland model of armed violence. Coupland and Taback later met Wille while she was working for the Small Arms Survey (2006), and applied the model to map the nature and extent of armed violence on a geographical basis. Willie worked on refining the model further and the structure of the corresponding databases to allow application of the model to analyze different kinds of violent events. Later Taback, Willie and Coupland founded Insecurity Insight (2008). ==Activities== The core activity of Insecurity Insight is to promote, use and make available to others the Taback-Coupland model. Because the model can be applied to any act of violence using any weapons resulting in any effect, the model has been applied to subjects such as explosive force in populated areas,Action on Armed Violence (2009). ”Explosive Violence: The Problem of Explosive Weapons.” attacks on journalistsTaback, Nathan and Robin Coupland (2006). ”Security of Journalists: Making the Case for Modelling Armed Violence as a Means to Promote Human Security.” Thinking Outside the Box in Multilateral Disarmament and Arms Control Negotiations by John Borrie and Vanessa Martin Randin (eds), 2006, United Nations publication, Sales No.GV.E.06.0.16; pp. 191–206. and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Zimbabwe and attacks on health care workers and facilities.Coupland Robin, Christina Wille, Nathan Taback and Simon Regard, ICRC (2011). ”Sixteen Country Study: Health Care in Danger.” A major ongoing project is the building of the “Security in Numbers Database.” This is a collaborative effort initiated by Insecurity Insight involving a number of major international humanitarian NGOs. By taking part in this project, these organisations share their security incidents with Insecurity Insight on a confidential basis; this permits analysis of these incidents by the model and therefore comparison of any single agency’s security issues with what is known globally about aid worker security. This has already generated findings.Wille, Christina and Larissa Fast (2011). ”Security Facts for Humanitarian Agencies: Aid, Gender and Security: The Gendered Nature of Security Events Affecting Aid Workers and Aid Delivery.”Wille, Christina and Larissa Fast (2010) ”Is Terrorism an Issue for Humanitarian Agencies?” Perspectives 3 by the Security Management Initiative.Wille Christina and Larissa Fast (2010). ”Security Facts for Humanitarian Agencies: How do security events affecting humanitarian agencies differ between rural and urban environments?” ==Taback-Coupland model of armed violence== The \\"Taback-Coupland model of armed violence.\\" Based on a standard public health model, the Taback-Coupland model takes as a starting point that use of weapons has a health impact and that this health impact is amenable to a preventive approach as any other public health issue. By generating data about threats to and vulnerabilities of people’s lives and well-being through violence and weapons, appropriate preventive policies can be proposed. The model is constructed around four “risk factors” or determinants for any given effects of armed violence. The four determinants are the nature of the weapon, the number of weapons used (or potentially used), the way the weapon is used (the psychological aspect of the violence), and the victims’ vulnerability. An example is the lethality of attacks with firearms. This will be determined by: *the kind of firearms (death is more likely if a larger calibre weapon is used, because the wound will be bigger); *how many firearms are being shot against the victim(s); *whether the user is standing close to (e.g. 5 metres) or further away (e.g. 200 metres) from the victim(s); *whether the victim(s) of the attack are cornered, tied up, can run away or take cover. This example also shows the important interaction at a psychological level between how the weapon is used, the other determinants and perceptions of the potential outcome. (Whether the trigger is pulled to cause a fatal injury is influenced, for example, by whether the user of the firearm believes he or she can hit the victim(s) with it, whether there are others similarly armed, how easy it is to hit the victim(s) in that context, and whether the victim(s) have already been hit.) ===How to use the model=== The method uses written reports of real incidents of armed violence as the source for the necessary values. Information from a report on an individual incident is entered into a spreadsheet specially designed to capture and process information about the people committing violence and about the victim(s) or potential victim(s). In this way, qualitative sources of data about violence i.e., reports, can be fed into a specially prepared relational database; this uses binaries and surrogates to give a numeric value to determinants such as intent and vulnerability. (For example, for vulnerability: Were the people herded into a confined space before being shot? Yes / No) A “report” can be a very short text as indicated by the following sentence: “Two masked men entered Hospital X last night and shot dead a sleeping patient.” In terms of entry into the database, this can be read as: Two masked men [number of people armed] entered Hospital X [where] last night [when] and shot [weapon (firearms)] dead [outcome] a [outcome] sleeping patient [vulnerability]. (\\"Shot dead\\" is also a comment on intent.) When the database has been fed with a sufficient number of reports of real events about a certain issue, this permits an “evidence-based” dialogue about the perpetrators and their intents and about the victims and their vulnerabilities. Taback and Coupland tested the model using global news reports about violence in general and about attacks on journalists.Taback, Nathan and Robin Coupland (2006). ”Security of Journalists: Making the Case for Modelling Armed Violence as a Means to Promote Human Security.” They went further and termed such an approach “the science of human security.” All important limitations of the data gathering method based on the model relate to the completeness and accuracy of the qualitative reports which are fed into the model. However, as Taback and Coupland have pointed out, reports, especially media reports may be the only information available about a given context or form of violence in multiple contexts. It is nevertheless possible to generate policy-relevant quantitative data from such sources. Further, they point out that while there are international surveillance systems for monitoring infectious disease outbreaks, no such system exists (yet) to evaluate on a regular basis the effects of armed violence on peoples’ lives. With that in mind, the method developed by Taback and Coupland is a useful contribution to international efforts to enhance human security, including in disarmament. ===Use of the Taback-Coupland model=== The model has generated original and policy-relevant data in relation to subjects such as explosive force in populated areas, and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Zimbabwe.Aids-Free World.

For low density electron systems, however, the Fermi surface can be substantially smaller than the size of the Brillouin zone, and only a small fraction of acoustic phonons can scatter off electrons. This results in a new characteristic temperature known as the Bloch–Grüneisen temperature that is lower than the Debye temperature. The Bloch–Grüneisen temperature is defined as 2ħvskF/kB, where ħ is the Planck constant, vs is the velocity of sound, ħkF is the Fermi momentum, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. When the temperature is lower than the Bloch–Grüneisen temperature, the most energetic thermal phonons have a typical momentum of kBT/vs which is smaller than ħkF, the momentum of the conducting electrons at the Fermi surface. This means that the electrons will only scatter in small angles when they absorb or emit a phonon. In contrast when the temperature is higher than the Bloch–Grüneisen temperature, there are thermal phonons of all momenta and in this case electrons will also experience large angle scattering events when they absorb or emit a phonon. In many cases, the Bloch–Grüneisen temperature is approximately equal to the Deybe temperature (usually written \\\\Theta_D), which is used in modeling specific heat capacity. However, in particular circumstances these temperatures can be quite different. The theory was initially put forward by Felix Bloch and Eduard Grüneisen. The Bloch–Grüneisen temperature has been observed experimentally in a two-dimensional electron gas and in graphene. Mathematically, the Bloch–Grüneisen model produces a resistivity given by: \\\\rho(T)=A(\\\\frac{T}{\\\\Theta_R})^n \\\\int_0^{\\\\Theta_R/T}\\\\frac{t^n}{(e^t-1)(1-e^{-t})}dt. Under Bloch's original assumptions for simple metals, n=5. For \\\\Theta_R \\\\gg T, this can be approximated as \\\\rho \\\\sim T^5 dependence. In contrast, the so called Bloch- Wilson limit, where n=3 works better for s-d inter-band scattering, such as with transition metals. The second limit gives \\\\rho \\\\sim T^3 at low temperatures. In practice, which model is more applicable depends on the particular material. ==References== Category:Condensed matter physics Category:Mesoscopic physics Category:Nanoelectronics ","title":"Bloch–Grüneisen temperature"},{"id":"35955143","text":"The Richmond Avenue Entertainment District, commonly known as the Richmond Strip, is an entertainment district along Richmond Avenue in western/southwestern Houston, Texas.

Webb took up etching in 1927 and his first successful plate was ‘’Falls of the Clyde’’ after J M W Turner. He returned to London in 1928 to continue etching under Hubert Schroeder at Chiswick. In 1929, Webb studied with F. L. Griggs in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, when the older artist became the principal contemporary influence upon Webb’s etched work both technically and in subject matter. Both artists shared a love of ancient buildings set in idealised landscapes, charged with a spiritual and mystical intensity. Following the example of the late Romantic etchings of Samuel Palmer, a group of contemporary British printmakers, including Robin Tanner, Graham Sutherland and Paul Drury, were developing a body of work based on evocative visionary scenes of a lost pre-industrial England. Webb’s most highly acclaimed works following his association with Griggs include 'Rat Barn' and 'Dream Barn', both etched in 1929 when he was just twenty years old, so that in that year he was elected an Associate Member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers. Webb travelled the British countryside in search of subject matter, visiting Buckinghamshire, Sussex, Kent, Gloucestershire and Wales. He went on to exhibit in art centres in London, Chicago, New York and Paris. In his paintings and prints, Webb assimilated beliefs founded on his interest in Eastern religions, astrology, mysticism and the occult. Etchers Kenneth Woodbridge and Edgar Holloway recall his interest in Theosophy with its origins in ‘Ancient Wisdom’ religions. Woodbridge, who knew Webb in the 1930s, described evenings in Webb’s studio listening to him talk of ‘faraway things, astrology, planetary chains’ and‘ancient races of men who lived before the dawn of history, in lost Atlantis’. (Hartley: 6) A close friend and ‘soul mate’ of the artist, Beryl Gascoigne remembers him talk not of his work but of reincarnation, astrology and eternity. Webb himself never wrote and seldom talked about his motivations; he felt the paintings and prints should speak forthemselves and that the production of art should be triggered by the ‘inner self’. (Meyrick: 33) Webb developed an interest in the writings of William Blake, continuing to make some of his most ambitious prints, expressing his mystical quest in a series of spiritualised landscape subjects. These include his striking series of large-scale etchings: 'The Speaker of Strange Truths', 'Astrologer Instructing his Pupils', 'A Mystery Temple' and 'The Doors of the Heart'. He also produced highly-wrought etchings on an intimate scale, plates such as 'Shepherd's Haven (1929) and 'A Buckinghamshire Lane' (1931). As the market for etchings all but dried up following the Wall Street Crash in October 1929, he supplemented his income by teaching etching at the Chiswick School of Art and undertaking varied commercial work, such as society portraits and posters for Shell-Mex. By the 1950s he abandoned printmaking and painted in an increasingly private and eccentric manner, altogether ceasing to exhibit his work. Suffering from mental illness, he helped run a café with his common-law wife, an art teacher Ella Hemans (d.1956), occasionally drawing cartoons and caricatures on menu cards. He died in London in 1962. ==Legacy== In spite of the decline in his reputation during his later years, today his etchings are among the most sought-after of his generation. They are found in major museum collections worldwide, including in Britain the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, and Aberystwyth School of Art Gallery and Museum, and in the United States in Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. “La Revue Moderne” wrote of Joseph Webb’s work: “A curious dualism in this artist shows first the poet, sensitive to scenes of nature, of romantic landscapes, then the seeker in the mystic, in love with everything relating to the intercourse of being with the unknown forces of the world.\\" ==ReferencesSources and bibliography== *Guichard, Kenneth M., British Etchers 1850-1940 (London: Robin Garton, 1977) *Hammersley, Kate, In the Master’s House: Religion and the Intaglio Prints of Joseph Webb 1908-1962 (Aberystwyth University: unpublished MA dissertation, 1995) *Hartley, Craig, Joseph Webb: Prints and Working Drawings (catalogue) (Cambridge: Fitzwilliam Museum, 1989) *Loffman, Jen On Resistance and Reconciliation: The Paintings of Joseph Webb 1908-1962 (Aberystwyth University: unpublished BA dissertation, 2012) *Meyrick, Robert, Joseph Webb: the lights that flit across my brain (Aberystwyth University: School of Art Museum and Gallery, 2007), PDF *Webb, Joseph, Exhibition of the Engraved Work of Joseph Webb ARE, list of works exhibited at Bent Tree Studio, Harrow-on- the-Hill,1932 *Harold Wright’s papers at the University of Glasgow Library Category:1908 births Category:1962 deaths Category:People from Ealing Category:Landscape artists Category:English printmakers ","title":"Joseph Webb"},{"id":"35955183","text":"The Three Sisters is a 1930 American pre-Code film directed by Paul Sloane and starring Louise Dresser, Tom Patricola and Kenneth MacKenna.

Buckingham House was built in 1703 for the Duke of Buckingham, and it was later purchased in 1761 by George III for his wife Charlotte and 14 of their 15 children were born there. George removed many of the ornate features but invested heavily in art from Europe. George IV wanted a grander building and with architect John Nash transformed the house into a palace, full of art and sculpture. By the time of his death, the project had overspent its budget by four times, and it was proposed to use it instead as a replacement parliament building. In 1837 Queen Victoria moved in and when she married Prince Albert they commissioned Edward Blore to move the Marble Arch and build a new wing across the front, which included the now-famous balcony, as well as a new ballroom. On Albert's death in 1861 Victoria retired and rarely used the palace. On her death Edward VII remodeled many rooms and installed toilets. In 1913 the last major work was when George V had the front refaced in white Portland stone, and during World War II it received minor bomb damage. ==Episode two: Windsor Castle== Bruce charts Windsor Castle, the oldest and the largest inhabited castle in the world dating back to the 11th century. Originally built in the Norman period, the castle was the inspiration behind the formation of the Order of the Garter by King Edward III of England much like the glory of the court of the Round Table of King Arthur. The first tournament of the Order was held at Windsor Castle on Saint George's Day 1349. The castle also houses the grand medieval Saint George's Chapel which is the spiritual home of the Order of the Garter. The castle was neglected until the Glorious Restoration of the monarchy by King Charles II who returned the castle to its former splendour by sumptuously redecorating it. The castle was again neglected for many years until the reign of King George IV who completely reinvented it. He doubled the height of the Round Tower by adding 30 ft in height. His greatest monument was the Waterloo Chamber, decorated with portraits of the key players who helped defeat Napoleon. During the First World War King George V changed the family name from the Germanic Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the more English House of Windsor as a symbol of strength and sovereignty. The castle suffered damage during World War II, and also the fire of 20 November 1992. Many of the castle's state rooms were destroyed but were all later restored after a £37 million programme was launched. ==Episode three: Palace of Holyroodhouse== Bruce charts the history of the Palace from its early days as an Augustinian abbey. Around 1501 James IV decided to convert the buildings into a palace. His daughter Mary, Queen of Scots returned from France to the palace at the age of eighteen after the death of her husband, the King of France, who had died after three years of marriage. Her disastrous second marriage to Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, the 1566 murder of her private secretary David Rizzio and the mysterious death of Darnley. The Palace also holds the last picture of Mary at the time of her execution. Later, the Civil War in England led to the neglect of the house until 1660 when Charles II of England was restored, and he updated the palace into a building never seen before in Scotland with classically themed French tapestries favoured at the time. He ordered a grand staircase and the Great Gallery, containing contemporary portraits of every Scottish monarch then known. In 1745 Bonnie Prince Charlie used the house as a campaign headquarters during his attempt to reclaim the throne for the Stuarts. George IV of the United Kingdom, born a German, was the first king to visit in over 150 years and, as his portrait in the palace testifies, the first one to wear tartan. The final stage covered is that of Queen Victoria, and the bequeathing in 1868 of an elaborate Flemish cabinet. ==Gallery== File:Buckingham Palace from gardens, London, UK - Diliff.jpg Buckingham Palace File:Windsor Castle at Sunset -

The medal was presented to commemorate service in the Franco Prussian War. The medal was presented to members of the united German armies. The medal was presented for combat service in bronze, and non-combat service in steel. Each version bore minor differences in inscription and design. Clasps were authorized on the 25th anniversary of the German victory, to commemorate selected battles. ==Criteria== The war medal was presented to officers, military physicians, civil servants and men of the German armies who took part in the Franco- Prussian war through 2 March 1871. It was also awarded to the crew of the SMS Augusta for service from 11 December 1870 to 2 March 1871. ==Appearance== Non- combatant version (obverse) The medal for combatants was manufactured from captured bronze cannon barrels. The obverse shows the crowned Royal cypher of William I over the inscription Dem siegreichen Heere (To the victorious army). Inscribed around the edge is Gott war mit uns, Ihm sei die Ehre (God was with us, to Him be the glory). The reverse shows a cross with rays between the four arms. In the center of the cross is a laurel wreath surrounding the dates 1870 and 1871. On the edge of the coin is inscribed AUS EROBERTEM GESCHUETZ (From conquered cannon). The medal for non-combatants is made of steel. It follows a similar design with only minor deviations. The center inscription on the obverse is Für Pflichttreue im Kriege (For devotion to duty in the war). On the reverse the wreath on the cross is of oak leaves. ==Clasps== To commemorate the 25th anniversary of victory, clasps were authorized to be worn on the medal on 18 August 1895. The clasps were only allowed to be worn on combatant medals by front line soldiers. The clasps are 6 mm high and 32–39 mm wide and were made of gilt bronze or brass. They are as follows: Combatant medal with three clasps ==Reuse of the Design== The reverse of the medal, with dates \\"1914-1918\\", but without rays, was used as the obverse of The Honour Cross of the World War 1914/1918. The German government awarded this to participants, or surviving family members, for service in the First World War. The same ribbon colour scheme was also used. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Kriegsdenkmünze 1871 Category:Military awards and decorations of Prussia Category:1871 establishments in Prussia Category:Awards established in 1871 ","title":"War Commemorative Medal of 1870/71"},{"id":"35955262","text":"The Loner is a 2011 crime/thriller novel by Scottish writer Quintin Jardine. Written as an autobiography, it is an account of the life of its principal character, Xavier 'Xavi' Aislado, a journalist with the fictional Edinburgh- based broadsheet, The Saltire. The book is a standalone novel, but features an appearance by Jardine's Edinburgh police detective, Bob Skinner. The Loner received generally positive reception from reviewers. ==Plot summary== The book is presented as a manuscript written by Aislado, which he has passed on to Jardine for him to ghost write. Born in the early 1960s of Scottish and Catalan heritage (his mother is Scottish and his father Spanish), Xavi is raised in Edinburgh by his father Josip (Joe), and Joe's formidable mother, Paloma Puig, who were forced to leave Catalonia when Spain was gripped by the Civil War that saw General Franco's Fascists emerge as the ruling force. Paloma's grim brand of care sees Xavi into his teenage years, but after democracy is restored to Spain Paloma and Joe decide to return to that country, settling near Girona, and leaving Xavi in Scotland to complete his education. As a consequence he is required to grow up fast. After attending George Watson's College Xavi studies at Heriot-Watt University, while in Spain Joe Aislado buys a failing Catalan newspaper, Girona Dia and begins to improve its fortunes. Xavi embarks on a career as a professional footballer with Heart of Midlothian, where he is nicknamed 'Big Iceland' because of his 6 ft 7in frame, but after being introduced to journalism on a visit to his father's newspaper while holidaying in Spain, his ambition is to become a reporter. When his football career is abruptly ended by injury, Xavi is able to concentrate his efforts on his journalistic career, and following his graduation he secures a job with The Saltire, a failing nationalist broadsheet. He is given a bloody introduction to the trade when his first assignment exposes a drug-dealing racket at a local school. A number of exclusives follow as Xavi cuts his teeth, and he quickly establishes himself as one of Scotland's leading reporters, helping to increase The Saltire's circulation in the process. Xavi meets his fiancé, the hypnotic Grace Starshine while at school, and they move in together as students, sharing a flat with close friends Scott Livingstone and Bobby Hannah. Xavi and Grace are later married. Inevitably, however, Xavi's life and his love become entwined with his work, and he is immersed in tragedy; firstly by the horrific murders of his in-laws during a robbery at their pharmaceutical company, and later by the death of his wife. With the help of Edinburgh detective Bob Skinner, and through his loss and the betrayal of those closest to him, Xavi is forced to travel to a distant shore in search of the truth. ==Main characters== *Xavier 'Xavi' Aislado – Professional footballer and journalist, and the book's central character. He is of Scottish and Catalan heritage. *Joe Aislado – Xavi's father. Edinburgh businessman who runs a chain of pubs, but later sells them to return to Spain, where he buys the newspaper Girona Dia *Paloma Puig – Xavi's paternal grandmother who raises him. A Catalan woman forced to flee from Spain because of the Civil War. *Grace Starshine – Xavi's fiance and later his wife. Xavi first meets her while they are studying at George Watson's College. Her parents are Jewish. *Scott Livingstone – A friend from George Watson's who later shares a student flat with Xavi. *Bobby Hannah – A friend from George Watson's College who later shares a student flat with Xavi. *Mary Partridge – Xavi's estranged mother who left the family when he was a boy. *Tommy Partridge – Xavi's stepfather and Mary's husband. A detective with Lothian and Borders Police. *Rodney and Magda Starshine – Grace's parents. ==Reception== Pam Norfolk of the Lancashire Evening Post gave the book a very positive reception: \\"Packed with characters from every walk of life and a storyline that moves from the dark streets of Edinburgh's underbelly to the sunlit countryside of Spain, The Loner sees Jardine as his enigmatic best.\\" However, reviewing The Loner for The Guardian, John O'Connell was generally unenthusiastic about its content: \\"For the most part it's a sentimental coming-of-age story narrated by Xavi (as he's known) with all the brio of a Christmas round robin.\\" The online crime and thriller ezine Shots was more positive, describing The Loner as a \\"book of two halves\\": \\"It foregoes pace and quick kicks in favour of a slow-burn that cleverly hides the shocks to come in its narrative...The Loner is a genre-defying novel, with a depth beyond the remit of many crime stories.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== *The Loner at goodreads.com *Quintin Jardine's wsbsite Category:2011 British novels Category:Bob Skinner (book series) Category:British crime novels Category:Scottish thriller novels Category:Novels set in Edinburgh Category:Novels about journalists Category:2011 in Scotland ","title":"The Loner (Jardine novel)"},{"id":"35955269","text":"Armed members of the Argentine Patriotic League roaming the streets of Buenos Aires.

Even if they appeared in several Chilean cities they concentrated their activity in the provinces of Antofagasta, Tarapacá and Tacna, those that were annexed during the War of the Pacific (1879-1883). In these places the Patriotic Leagues launched attacks against Peruvian newspapers, societies and citizens contributing to the Chilenization of Tacna, Arica and Tarapacá. The passivity of the Chilean authorities of Iquique helped the Patriotic Leagues to achieve their principal goal: to frighten the Tarapacán families of Peruvian origin.González, Maldonado y McGee 1993 The situation was particularly problematic in Arica and Tacna, where a plebiscite was to determine their national future as either under the rule of Chile or Peru.
