It was minted in the Spanish Empire following a monetary reform in 1497. It was widely used as the first international currency because of its uniformity in standard and milling characteristics. Some countries countersigned the Spanish dollar so it could be used as their local currency. The Spanish dollar was the coin upon which the original United States dollar was based, and it remained legal tender in the United States until the Coinage Act of 1857. Because it was widely used in Europe, the Americas, and the Far East, it became the first world currency by the late 18th century. Aside from the U.S. dollar, several other currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, the Japanese yen, the Chinese yuan, the Philippine peso, and several currencies in the rest of the Americas, were initially based on the Spanish dollar and other 8-real coins.'The Silver Way' Explains How the Old Mexican Dollar Changed the World Diverse theories link the origin of the \\"$\\" symbol to the columns and stripes that appear on one side of the Spanish dollar. The term peso was used in Spanish to refer to this denomination, and it became the basis for many of the currencies in the former Spanish colonies, including the Argentine, Bolivian, Chilean, Colombian, Costa Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Ecuadorian, Guatemalan, Honduran, Mexican, Nicaraguan, Paraguayan, Philippine, Puerto Rican, Peruvian, Salvadoran, Uruguayan, and Venezuelan pesos. Of these, \\"peso\\" remains the name of the official currency in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Philippines, and Uruguay. Millions of Spanish dollars were minted over the course of several centuries. They were among the most widely circulating coins of the colonial period in the Americas, and were still in use in North America and in South-East Asia in the 19th century. History Etymology of \\"dollar\\" In the 16th century, Count Hieronymus Schlick of Bohemia began minting a silver coin known as a (from German , modern spelling , \\"valley\\", cognate with \\"dale\\" in English), named for , the valley in the Ore Mountains where the silver was mined.National Geographic. June 2002. p. 1. Ask Us. was later shortened to or thaler, a word that eventually found its way into many European languages including the Spanish and English as dollar. The weighed 451 Troy grains (29.2 g) of silver. So successful were these coins that similar s were minted in Burgundy and France. The Burgundian Cross depicted the Cross of Burgundy and was prevalent in the Burgundian Netherlands that were revolting against the Spanish king and Duke of Burgundy Philip II. After 1575, the Dutch revolting provinces replaced the currency with a depicting a lion, hence its Dutch name . Specifically to facilitate export trade, the was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of 0.750 fine silver, lighter than the large denomination coins then in circulation. Clearly it was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in s rather than in other heavier, more costly coins. Thus, the or lion dollar became the coin of choice for foreign trade. It became popular in the Middle East, and colonies in the east and west. They also circulated throughout the English colonies during the 17th and early 18th centuries. From New Netherland (New York) the lion dollar spread to all thirteen colonies in the west. English speakers began to apply the word \\"dollar\\" also to the Spanish peso or \\"piece of eight\\" by 1581, which was also widely used in the British North American colonies at the time of the American Revolution, hence adopted as the name and weight of the US monetary unit in the late 18th century.Oxford English Dictionary, entry on \\"dollar\\", definition 2 (\\"The English name for the peso or piece of eight (i.e. eight ), formerly current in Spain and the Spanish American colonies\\"). Spain A silver Spanish dollar minted in Mexico City See also: Spanish real, Peso After the introduction of the Guldengroschen in Austria in 1486, the concept of a large silver coin with high purity (sometimes known as \\"specie\\" coinage) eventually spread throughout the rest of Europe. Monetary reform in Spain brought about the introduction of an 8-real (or 1-peso) coin in 1497, minted to the following standards- * In 1497: dollars to a Castilian mark of silver (230.0465 grams), or 0.9306 fine (25.563 g fine silver) * In 1728: $8.50 to a mark, or 0.9167 fine (24.809 g fine silver) * In 1772: $8.50 to a mark, or 0.9028 fine (24.443 g fine silver; but true fineness 1772–1821 believed to be only 0.89.. This was supplemented In 1537 by the gold escudo, minted at 68 to a mark of gold 0.917 fine (fineness reduced to 0.906 in 1742 and 0.875 in 1786). It was valued at 15–16 reales or approximately 2 dollars. The famed Gold Doubloon was worth 2 escudos or approximately 4 dollars. From the 15th to the 19th centuries the coin was minted with several different designs at various mints in Spain and the New World, having gained wide acceptance beyond Spain's borders. Thanks to the vast silver deposits that were found mainly in Potosí in modern-day Bolivia and to a lesser extent in Mexico (for example, at Taxco and Zacatecas), and to silver from Spain's possessions throughout the Americas, mints in Mexico and Peru also began to strike the coin. The main New World mints for Spanish dollars were at Potosí, Lima, and Mexico City (with minor mints at Bogotá, Popayán, Guatemala City, and Santiago), and silver dollars from these mints could be distinguished from those minted in Spain by the Pillars of Hercules design on the reverse. The dollar or peso was divided into 8 reales in Spanish Latin America until 19th century when the peso was divided instead into 100 centavos. However, monetary turbulence in Spain beginning under the reign of King Philip II resulted in the dollar being subdivided as follows in Spain only: * Until 1642: $1 = 8 reales, subsequently called reales nacionales * From 1642: $1 = 10 reales provinciales * From 1687: $1 = reales de vellón (made of billon alloy; edict not effective) * From 1737: $1 = 20 reales de vellón * In 1864: $1 = 2 silver escudos (different from the gold escudo) * And finally, in 1869: $1 = 5 Spanish pesetas, the latter at par with the French franc in the Latin Monetary Union. Spain's adoption of the peseta in 1869 and its joining the Latin Monetary Union meant the effective end of the last vestiges of the Spanish dollar in Spain itself. However, the 5-peseta coin (or duro) was slightly smaller and lighter but was also of high purity (90%) silver. In the 1990s, commemorative 2,000-peseta coins were minted, similar in size and weight to the dollar. Mexico Spanish dollar coin minted in Mexico City Following independence in 1821, Mexican coinage of silver reales and gold escudos followed that of Spanish lines until decimalization and the introduction of the peso worth 8 reales or 100 centavos. It continued to be minted to Spanish standards throughout the 19th century, with the peso at 27.07 g of 0.9028 fine silver, and the escudo at 3.383 g of 0.875 fine gold. The Mexican peso or 8-real coin continued to be a popular international trading coin throughout the 19th century. After 1918, the peso was reduced in size and fineness, with further reductions in the 1940s and 1950s. However, 2- (1921), 5- (1947) and 10- (1955) peso coins were minted during the same period with sizes and fineness similar to the old peso. Ireland and British colonies The term cob was used in Ireland and the British colonies to mean a piece of eight or a Spanish-American dollar, because Spanish gold and silver coins were irregularly shaped and crudely struck during this period. Australia After the colony of New South Wales was founded in Australia in 1788, it ran into the problem of a lack of coinage, particularly since trading vessels took coins out of the colony in exchange for their cargo. In 1813, Governor Lachlan Macquarie made creative use of £10,000 in Spanish dollars sent by the British government. To make it difficult to take the coins out of the colony, and to double their number, the centres of the coins were punched out. The punched centre, known as the \\"dump\\", was valued at 15 pence, and the outer rim, known as the \\"holey dollar\\", was worth five shillings. This was indicated by overstamping the two new coins. The obverse of the holey dollar was stamped the words \\"New South Wales\\" and the date, 1813, and the reverse with the words \\"five shillings\\". The obverse of the dump was stamped with a crown, the words \\"New South Wales\\" and the date, 1813, and the reverse with the words \\"fifteen pence\\". The mutilated coins became the first official currency produced specifically for circulation in Australia. The expedient was relatively short lived. The British Parliament passed the Sterling Silver Money Act in 1825, which made British coins the only recognised form of currency and ended any legitimate use of the holey dollar and dump in the Australian colonies. United States The Coinage Act of 1792 created the United States Mint and initially defined the United States dollar at par with the Spanish dollar due to its international reputation: > By far the leading specie coin circulating in America was the Spanish silver > dollar, defined as consisting of 387 grains of pure silver. The dollar was > divided into \\"pieces of eight,\\" or \\"bits,\\" each consisting of one-eighth of > a dollar. Spanish dollars came into the North American colonies through > lucrative trade with the West Indies. The Spanish silver dollar had been the > world's outstanding coin since the early 16th century, and was spread > partially by dint of the vast silver output of the Spanish colonies in Latin > America. More important, however, was that the Spanish dollar, from the 16th > to the 19th century, was relatively the most stable and least debased coin > in the Western world. Rothbard, Murray, Commodity Money in Colonial America, > LewRockwell.com The Coinage Act of 1792 specified that the U.S. dollar would contain 371.25 grains (24.057 g) pure or 416 grains (26.96 g) standard silver. This specification was based on the average weight of a random selection of worn Spanish dollars which Alexander Hamilton ordered to be weighed at the Treasury. Initially this dollar was comparable to the 371–373 grains found in circulating Spanish dollars and aided in its exportation overseas. The restoration of the old 0.9028 fineness in the Mexican peso after 1821, however, increased the latter’s silver content to 24.44 g and reduced the export demand for US dollars. Before the American Revolution, owing to British mercantilist policies, there was a chronic shortage of British currency in Britain's colonies. Trade was often conducted with Spanish dollars that had been obtained through illicit trade with the West Indies. Spanish coinage was legal tender in the United States until the Coinage Act of 1857 discontinued the practice. The pricing of equities on U.S. stock exchanges in -dollar denominations persisted until the New York Stock Exchange converted first to pricing in sixteenths of a dollar on 24 June 1997, and shortly after that, to decimal pricing. Asia 1888 Mexican dollar with Chinese \\"chop\\" marksLong tied to the lore of piracy, \\"pieces of eight\\" were manufactured in the Americas and transported in bulk back to Spain, making them a very tempting target for seagoing pirates. The Manila galleons transported Mexican silver to Manila in the Spanish Philippines, where it would be exchanged for Philippine and Chinese goods, since silver was the only foreign commodity China would accept. In Oriental trade, Spanish dollars were often stamped with Chinese characters known as \\"chop marks\\" which indicated that particular coin had been assayed by a well-known merchant and determined to be genuine. The specifications of the Spanish dollar became a standard for trade in the Far East, with later Western powers issuing trade dollars, and colonial currencies such as the Hong Kong dollar, to the same specifications. The first Chinese yuan coins had the same specification as a Spanish dollar, leading to a continuing equivalence in some respects between the names \\"yuan\\" and \\"dollar\\" in the Chinese language. Other currencies also derived from the dollar include the Japanese yen, Korean won, Philippine peso and the Malaysian ringgit. Contemporary names used for Spanish dollars in Qing Dynasty China include benyang (本洋), shuangzhu (双柱), zhuyang (柱洋), foyang (佛洋), fotou (佛頭), foyin (佛銀), and fotouyin (佛頭銀). The \\"fo\\" element in those Chinese names referred to the King of Spain in those coins, as his face resembled that of images of the Buddha; and the \\"zhu\\" part of those names referred to the two pillars in the Spanish coat of arms. Fiction In modern pop culture and fiction, \\"pieces of eight\\" are most often associated with the popular notion of pirates. Fictional portrayals * In Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island, Long John Silver's parrot had apparently been trained to cry outOr had learned to imitate the phrase after hearing it exclaimed over a spectacularly large horde: Treasure Island, chapter \\"The Voyage\\", states that the parrot was present at the \\"fishing up of the wrecked Plate ships\\" and 350,000 pieces of eight, \\"Pieces of eight!\\" This use tied the coin (and parrots) to fictional depictions of pirates. Deriving from the wide popularity of this book, \\"Pieces of eight\\" is sometimes used to mean \\"money\\" or \\"a lot of money\\", regardless of specific denomination, and also as a synonym for treasure in general. * In Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End the Pirate Lords must meet together by presenting the \\"Nine Pieces of Eight\\", since these Pieces were used to seal the goddess Calypso in her human form by the first Brethren Court. As the Pirate Lords were, at the time of sealing Calypso into her human form, too poor to offer real Spanish dollars, they opted to use personal talismans instead, except for the \\"ninth piece of eight\\" (Jack Sparrow's), which was an actual piece of eight that is hanging off his bandana in all movies, up to its destruction in the third film. *Pieces of Eight is the eighth studio album and second concept album by Styx, released on 1 September 1978. *In May of 1987, Neil Peart of Rush recorded a flexi-disc for Modern Drummer magazine titled, Pieces of Eight. * In Terry Prattchet's \\"Going Postal\\" the antagonist, Reacher Gilt had a cockatoo named Alphonse which had been trained to say \\"Twleve and half percent!\\", that is to say a single piece of eight https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/Reacher_Gilt.

Important musical traditions in Turkmen music include traveling singers and shamans called bakshy, who act as healers and magicians and sing either a cappella or with instruments such as the two-stringed lute called dutar. Turkmenistan's national poet is Magtumguly Pyragy, from the 18th century, who wrote four-line goshuk lyrics. The Central Asian classical music tradition mugam is also present in Turkmenistan by name as the mukamlar . National anthem As a Soviet Republic, Turkmenistan's national anthem was \\"Turkmenistan\\", composed by Veli Mukhatov with words by Aman Kekilov. In 1997 (well after independence), the anthem was changed to the \\"National anthem of Independent, Neutral, Turkmenistan\\", the music and lyrics of which were written by President-for-Life Saparmurat Niyazov. Dutar The dutar is the most representative instrument of Turkmen folk music. It is used in many styles, ranging from the mukamlar and saltıklar to the kirklar and navoi. These are performed by professional musicians called sazanda. Tuiduk Tuiduk is a wind instrument (similar to Zurna). Turkmen say that Adam who was moulded from clay had no soul. It was only due to the melodious tuiduk playing Archangel Gabriel could breathe life into him. According to a Turkmen legend the main role in tuiduk invention was played by the devil. There is a ritual of inviting guests for a celebration which has survived from ancient times. Two tuiduk players stand in front each other, point their instruments upwards and play in unison. While doing this they perform magic circular movements which remind that this ritual used to be linked to shamanism. Dili tuiduk The Dili tuiduk is a Turkmen woodwind instrument. It is a clarinet-like, single-reed instrument used mainly in Turkmen folk music. The instrument's range is greater than its six finger holes would suggest, the upper registers being attained by breath control. Dili tuiduk of the Turkmen can be carved in a couple of minutes by a shepherd in the springtime, when reeds grow tall, but a set of brass instruments for a police band needs an investment of money and time to arrive in town. *http://afghanistan.wesleyan.edu/instruments/images/image6.jpg Gargy tuiduk Gargy-tuyduk this is a long reed flute whose origin, according to legend, is connected with Alexander of Macedonia, and a similar instrument existed in ancient Egypt. Gargy means in the Turkmen language \\"reed\\". Bakshy Bakshy were formerly the most important musicians in Turkmen society, along with tuidukists. They played the dutar to celebrate weddings, births, and other events. Mugam Mugam is a pan-Central Asian style of classical music, performed in Turkmenistan by a dutarist and gidjakist, or by an ensemble of just dutarists .

The komuz is the national instrument of Kyrgyzstan. It is a plucked string instrument. The kyl kiak, however, is also an important symbol of Kyrgyz identity. It is a string instrument, related to the Mongolian morin khuur, and is associated with horses and the vital role they play in Kyrgyz culture.

Kazakhstan is home to the Kazakh State Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, the Kazakh State Philharmonic Orchestra, the Kazakh National Opera and the Kazakh State Chamber Orchestra. The folk instrument orchestra was named after Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly, a well-known composer and dombra player from the 19th century. Traditional music Traditional music in Kazakhstan often refers to music of the following genres: * Instrumental music, with the pieces (\\"Küy\\") being performed by soloists. Text is often seen in the background (or \\"program\\") for the music, as a lot of Küy titles refer to stories. * Vocal music, either as part of a ceremony such as a wedding (mainly performed by women), or as part of a feast. Here we might divide into subgenres: epic singing, containing not only historical facts, but as well the tribe's genealogy, love songs, didactic verses; and as a special form the composition of two or more singers in public (Aitys), of dialogue character and usually unexpectedly frankly in content. Russian and Soviet- era music Postage stamp depicting a dombra, the most popular traditional musical instrument of Kazakhstan The Russian influence on the music life in Kazakhstan can be seen in two spheres: * First, the introduction of musical academic institutions such as concert houses with opera stages, conservatories (where European music was performed and taught). * Second, by trying to incorporate Kazakh traditional music into these academic structures. Controlled by the Russian Empire and then the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan's folk and classical traditions became connected with ethnic Russian music and Western European music. Prior to the 20th century, Kazakh folk music was collected and studied by ethnographic research teams including composers, music critics and musicologists. In the first part of the 19th century, Kazakh music was transcribed in linear notation. Some composers of this era set Kazakh folk songs to Russian-style European classical music. Kazakh musicians themselves, however, did not write their own music with notation until 1931. Later, as part of the Soviet Union, certain Kazakh folk culture was encouraged to avoid political and social unrest. The result was a derivative of Kazakh folk music. In 1920, Aleksandr Zatayevich, a Russian official, created major works of art music with melodies and other elements from Kazakh folk music. Beginning in 1928 and accelerating in the 1930s, he also adapted traditional Kazakh instruments for use in Russian-style ensembles (such as increasing the number of frets and strings). Soon, these styles of modern orchestral playing became the only way for musicians to officially play; Kazakh folk was turned into patriotic, professional and socialist endeavors. Musical institutions The Musical-Dramatic Training College, founded in 1931, was the first institute of higher education for music in Kazakhstan. Two years later, the Orchestra of Kazakh Folk Musical Instruments was formed The Foundation Asyl Mura is archives and publishes historical recordings of Kazakh music both traditional and classical. The Qurmanghazy Conservatoire is considered one of the leading conservatoires in Almaty. Musical traditional instruments Traditional instruments of Kazakhstan The most popular traditional instruments are string instruments. First of them is the dombra (домбыра), the most popular and the oldest Kazakh music instrument. Some argue that nomads have used similar two-string instruments more than two thousand years ago. The dombra is a long-necked lute with two strings tuned in the interval of a fourth or sometimes a fifth. The strings are plucked or strummed by the right hand without a plectrum. The other instrument playing an important role is the Qobyz, which is a bowed instrument held between the legs. It is made of carved wood for the body, animal skin for the resonator, and horse hair for the strings, and the bow. The Qobyz is said to have been invented by the legendary shaman Qorqyt, long before the medieval ages. The \\"Zhetigen\\" (\\"Seven strings\\") could be seen as a member of the cither family, finding equivalents in China, with the strings being divided each in two parts of different lengths, the bridge being movable and consisting of small bone. There is also a plucked lute called sherter (шертер).  List of Kazakh traditional instruments  * Dombra (Kazakh: домбыра) is a stringed instrument of the Turkic, which is widely spread among the Turks. Dombra is made of hollow wood, wooden parts and two strings. 19 (sometimes 22) keys are attached to the neck. Has variation as three-stringed dombra, double-sided, wide-body, hollow-necked, etc. * Kobyz (khylkobyz (Kazkah: қобыз)) is a stringed-bowed instrument. Kobyz has a bucket-shaped body, an arcuate curved neck and a large flat head. The half of surface is covered with skin. Strings and bow are made of horse hair. It is made of solid wooden block. Often done with two strings, but also there are three-stringed, four-stringed kobyz and has variations like \\"nar kobyz\\", \\"jez kobyz\\". * Jew's harp (shankobyz (Kazakh: шаңқобыз)) is an ancient musical instrument of the Kazakh people that is made of silver or iron. It is not so big, with a body and arcuate tongue. The way you play on this instrument is directly related to the interaction with the oral cavity. When playing the instrument, use the right hand to pull the instrument by the tongue. In ancient times, the shankobyz was a child's and a woman's instrument. Shankobyz has many names in different nations: vargan, temir komyz, komys, aure, komus, vaniar, tumra, kousian, etc. * Sherter (Kazakh: шертер) is a stringed instrument. It is played like dombyra, but the bone is less than dombyra and it looks like a kobyz. It is made of wood, but the exterior is covered with skin. It is mostly played by shepherds, and often used for accompaniment of fables. * Jetigen (Kazakh: жетіген) is a polychord instrument. The form of instrument is oblong, with the shape of a box. 13 (or it can be 7) strings are attached to both ends of the box and there are special wooden parts on each string. All of the Turkic cultures have jetigen, but have different names of it: Tatars \\"etigan\\", Tyvalks \\"shatkan\\", etc. *Dauylpaz (Kazakh: дауылпаз) is a percussion instrument which was a military instrument. In ancient times, it lifted the spirit of warriors and hunters. In structure it resembles an ordinary drum. The manufacturing process is very complicated: you need to make groove in wood, cover the top with skin, make a belt to carry it everywhere and a stick to beat it. * Konyrau (Kazakh: қоңырау) is a musical instrument that is made of gold or silver. The structure is close to the bell. Bells of different sizes are distributed on a wooden base and, when stressed, produces an enjoyable ringing. Some artists attach the konyrau to the top of their instrument while playing. * Zhelbuaz (Kazakh: желбуаз) * Asatayak (Kazakh: асатаяқ)  Current status  Traditional Kazakh instruments are often used in contemporary music and play a big role in Kazakh music. Traditional orchestras include \\"Otryrar Sazy\\", \\"Kurmangazy Orchestra\\", \\"Al-Faraby sazy\\", and a number of others. Kazakh instruments are used not only by artists but also are an integral part of the life of almost every Kazakh.  Contemporary genres   Kazakhstani hip hop  The Kazakhstani hip hop and rap scene started to emerge in the country after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union. Hip-hop easily flourished in Kazakhstan due to the use of Russian in its songs, which makes it easier for Kazakh rappers to achieve popularity in other Russian-speaking countries. Kazakh groups such as Tristar began to be featured on MTV Russia.Онпрюк Almatykz, Мюьх Гбегдш *Tristar* Hip-hop is arguably the most popular contemporary music genre in Kazakhstan, especially among the youth. In 2013, American rapper Kanye West was privately invited by President Nursultan Nazarbayev to perform at his grandson's wedding. Later on in the 2010s, Kazakh hip-hop would influence the development of the Q-pop music genre. Well-known Kazakh rappers are Jah Khalib, Natan, and Scriptonite.  Kazakhstani rock  Kazakhstani rock is a form of rock music in Kazakhstan, with lyrics written and performed both in Kazakh and Russian. Rock music has been popular in Kazakhstan, especially in Karaganda Region, since the 1960s, when it was popularized by The Beatles. During the Soviet era, Kazakhstan was exposed to both American and Russian rock. Well-known Kazakh rock bands are Adaptatsiya, Ulytau, and Urker.  Q-pop  Q-pop or Qazaq pop is a comparatively new musical genre of Kazakhstan. The term was first coined in 2015. Q-pop originates from K-Pop, hip-hop, Western pop and J-Pop respectively. Kazakhstani entertainment company Juz Entertainment has been credited as the pioneer of the genre, with its boy group Ninety One debuting in 2015. Artists like Ziruza, Mad Men, Moonlight, Newton, Juzim, and CrystalZ also contribute to the genre. The prize-winning Kazakh singer Dimash Kudaibergen mixes pop with elements of classical music and traditional Kazakh folk music.  Toi  Toi (Той; literally means public gathering) refers to easy-listening folk music with catchy rhythm, usually performed in weddings and festives. This genre is also popular in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan. Well-known Kazakh toi singers are Qairat Nurtas, Abdijappar Alqoja, Madina Saduakasova and Jazira Baiyrbekova.

The classical music is shashmaqam, which Uzbeks also developed classical music of Tajiks and made their distinctive own. Southern Tajikistan has a distinctive form of folk music called falak, which is played at celebrations for weddings, circumcisions and other occasions. Tajik folk music Tajik folk music is traditionally divided into three styles, Pamir (Mountain-Badakhshan province), Central Kuhistoni (Hisor, Kulob, Gharm provinces) and Sogdiana's northern style; the latter is part of the same musical culture as the adjacent regions of Uzbekistan (Kashkadarya Province and Surkhandarya Province). There are many kinds of songs, both lyrical and instrument, including work songs, ceremonial, funeral, wedding and musical epics, especially the central Tajik heroic legend Gurugli also known as \\"Omar Sham Sham\\". Gharibi Gharibi is the song of a stranger, an early 20th-century innovation of poor farm laborers and other workers who had to leave their land. Holiday music Gulgardoni is a springtime holiday (also called Boychechak) which includes carolling celebratory songs accompanied by the dutar and doira. Sayri Guli Lola is the holiday of tulips, which includes accompanied choral and dance music. The most important song of this holiday is called \\"Naqshi Kalon\\". The birth of a child is cause for special musical celebration. Traditional puppeteers play on the doira, qayroq, surnay and nag'ora. There are other variations, and folk songs like \\"Na\`at\\" and \\"Munojot\\", performed at the circumcision ceremony of a male child. Traditional Tajik wedding music is played by sozanda, professional musicians, mostly female, who are part of ensembles called the dasta. Badakhshan Badakhshan is a region inhabited by Tajik Ismailis, known for their sung spiritual poetry called madah. Lutes are a major part of Ismaili folk music.

It builds on folk traditions that reach back nearly 1,000 years.David C. King. Azerbaijan, Marshall Cavendish, 2006, p. 94 For centuries, Azerbaijani music has evolved under the badge of monody, producing rhythmically diverse melodies.Энциклопедический музыкальный словарь, 2-е изд., Москва, 1966 (Encyclopedical Music Dictionary (1966-1967), 2nd ed., Moscow) Music from Azerbaijan has a branch mode system, where chromatisation of major and minor scales is of great importance.  Classical music  In 1920, Azerbaijani classical music had undergone a renaissance and Baku Academy of Music was founded to give classical musicians the same support as folk musicians. Modern day advocates of Western classical music in Azerbaijani include Farhad Badalbeyli, Fidan Gasimova and Franghiz Alizadeh. Opera and Ballet The emergence of opera and ballet in Azerbaijan is associated with the Imperial Russian and Soviet era of Azerbaijani history when Azerbaijani musicians became exposed to European music traditions first-hand. The very first documented performance of an opera in Baku took place in May 1889 when Alexey Verstovsky's opera Askold's grave was staged at a circus arena in Baku (on the site of the current Azerbaijan Carpet Museum building), accompanied by the folk choir of Dmitry Agrenev-Slavyanski. Beginning in 1900, opera troupes toured Baku on a yearly basis (except 1901 and 1913), featuring prominent singers of the time such as Natalia Ermolenko-Yuzhina and Antonina Nezhdanova. Prominent Azerbaijani opera singers such as Bulbul, Shovkat Mammadova, Fatma Mukhtarova, Huseyngulu Sarabski, Hagigat Rzayeva, Rashid Behbudov, Rauf Atakishiyev, Muslim Magomayev, Lutfiyar Imanov, Fidan and Khuraman Gasimovas, Rubaba Muradova, Zeynab Khanlarova and many other singers gained world fame.  Folk music  Most songs recount stories of real life events and Azerbaijani folklore, or have developed through song contests between troubadour poets.Broughton, Simon and Sultanova, Razia. \\"Bards of the Golden Road\\". 2000. In Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.), World Music, Vol. 2: Latin & North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific, pp 24–31. Rough Guides Ltd, Penguin Books. Corresponding to their origins, folk songs are usually played at weddings, funerals and special festivals. Regional folk music generally accompanies folk dances, which vary significantly across regions. The regional mood also affects the subject of the folk songs, e.g. folk songs from the Caspian Sea are lively in general and express the customs of the region. Songs about betrayal have an air of defiance about them instead of sadness, whereas the further south travelled in Azerbaijan the more the melodies resemble a lament. As this genre is viewed as a music of the people, musicians in socialist movements began to adapt folk music with contemporary sounds and arrangements in the form of protest music.  Folk instruments  Balaban is considered Azerbaijan's national instrument. Instruments used in traditional Azerbaijani music include the stringed instruments tar (skin faced lute), the kamancha (skin faced spike fiddle), the oud, originally barbat, and the saz (long necked lute); the double-reed wind instrument balaban, the frame drum ghaval, the cylindrical double faced drum nagara (davul), and the gosha nagara (pair of small kettle drums). Other instruments include the garmon (small accordion), tutek (whistle flute), and daf (frame drum). Due to the cultural crossbreeding prevalent during the Ottoman Empire, the tutek has influenced various cultures in the Caucasus region, e.g. the duduks. The zurna and naghara duo is also popular in rural areas, and played at weddings and other local celebrations. Ashiqs Ashiqs are travelling bards who sing and play the saz, a form of lute. Their songs are semi-improvised around a common base. This art is one of the symbols of Azerbaijani culture and considered an emblem of national identity and the guardian of Azerbaijani language, literature and music. Characterized by the accompaniment of the kopuz, a stringed musical instrument, the classical repertoire of Azerbaijani Ashiqs includes 200 songs, 150 literary-musical compositions known as dastans, nearly 2,000 poems and numerous stories. Since 2009 the art of Azerbaijani Ashiqs has been inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Meykhana Meykhana is a distinctive Azerbaijani literary and folk rap tradition, consisting of an unaccompanied song performed by one or more people improvising on a particular subject.Мейхана - это не «хулиганский жанр», а часть азербайджанского фольклора - режиссер Абдуль Махмудов Meykhana is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to a beat. Meykhana is often compared to hip hop music, also known as national rap among Azerbaijani residents, as it also includes performers that is spoken lyrically, in rhyme and verse, generally to an instrumental or synthesized beat. Performers also incorporate synthesizers, drum machines, and live bands. Meykhana masters may write, memorize, or improvise their lyrics and perform their works a cappella or to a beat. Mugham Mugham is one of the many folk musical compositions from Azerbaijan, contrast with Tasnif, Ashugs.Intangible Cultural Heritage - The Azerbaijani Mugham Mugam draws on Arabic maqam.Music encyclopedias, e.g. The New Grove's entry on Azerbaijan. It is a highly complex art form that weds classical poetry and musical improvisation in specific local modes. Mugham is a modal system. Unlike Western modes, \\"mugham\\" modes are associated not only with scales but with an orally transmitted collection of melodies and melodic fragments that performers use in the course of improvisation. Mugham is a compound composition of many parts. The choice of a particular mugham and a style of performance fits a specific event. The dramatic unfolding in performance is typically associated with increasing intensity and rising pitches, and a form of poetic-musical communication between performers and initiated listeners. Three major schools of mugham performance existed from the late 19th and early 20th centuries - the region of Garabagh, Shirvan, and Baku. The town of Shusha of Karabakh was particularly renowned for this art. The short selection of Azerbaijani mugham played in balaban, national wind instrument was included on the Voyager Golden Record, attached to the Voyager spacecraft as representing world music, included among many cultural achievements of humanity.Azerbaijani Music Selected for Voyager SpacecraftAzerbaijani mugham sent out to outer space 32 years ago In 2003, UNESCO proclaimed mugham as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.UNESCO: The Azerbaijani Mugham  Popular music  Popular music is distinguished from the traditional genres as those styles that entered the Azerbaijani musicality after the fall of the Soviet Union, either due to attempts of national modernization from 1918 onwards, the opening of the republic to Western musical influences or modern fusions and innovations from artists themselves.  Mainstream pop  Nikki Jamal became one of the most successful pop artists of the 2010s. Azerbaijani pop music had its humble beginnings in the late 1950s with Azerbaijani cover versions of a wide range of imported popular styles, including rock and roll, tango, and jazz. As more styles emerged, they were also adopted, such as hip hop, heavy metal and reggae. Azerbaijani pop music reached new level after the country made its debut appearance at the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. The country's entry gained the third place in 2009 and fifth the following year. Ell and Nikki won the first place at the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 with the song \\"Running Scared\\", entitling Azerbaijan to host the contest in 2012, in Baku. The biggest pop stars in Azerbaijan are arguably Roya, Aygun Kazimova and Brilliant Dadashova.  Azerbaijani jazz  The Azerbaijani jazz is a popular variety of jazz, widespread in Azerbaijan. It covers a broad range of styles (traditional, post-pop, fusion, free flexion) and often features a blend with traditional Azerbaijani music. Among modern famed Azeri jazz musicians are Aziza Mustafazadeh, who was influenced by Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett,William Minor. Unzipped souls: a jazz journey through the Soviet Union, Temple University Press, 1995, p. 83-84 Isfar Sarabski, Salman Gambarov and Rain Sultanov.  Azerbaijani hip hop  The first Azerbaijani hip-hop song \\"Yesterday is Past\\", created in 1983 by Chingiz Mustafayev, who would later become Azerbaijan's national hero for unrelated reasons.Documenting the Horrors of Karabakh The pioneer of Azerbaijani rap often associated with name of Anar Nagilbaz in 1992, which also included elements of disco but the popularity of the rap genre came with the rise of Dayirman, which included primarily patriotic elements.  Azerbaijani rock  The Azerbaijani rock scene began in the mid-to late 1960s, when popular United States and United Kingdom bands became well-known. Soon, a distinctively Azerbaijani fusion of rock and folk emerged; this was called Azerbaijani rock, a term which nowadays may be generically ascribed to most of Azerbaijani rock. Coldünya and Yuxu are the best known group of older classical Azerbaijani rock music.  Electronic dance music  There are many clubs across Azerbaijan, especially across its Baku region. The alternative music scene however is derived mostly from Baku's club scene that sees DJs merging the past with the present, utilising traditional motifs with new age sounds and electronic music.

It is very similar to the music of the Middle East and is characterized by complicated rhythms and meters.Fierman, William. \\"Uzbekistan.\\" Microsoft Student 2009 [DVD]. Redmond, WA: Microsoft Corporation, 2008 Because of the long history of music in the country and the large variety of music styles and musical instruments, Uzbekistan is often regarded as one of the most musically diverse countries in Central Asia.  Classical music of Uzbekistan  The music of what is now Uzbekistan has a very long and rich history. Shashmaqam, a Central Asian classical music style, is believed to have arisen in the cities of Bukhara and Samarqand in the late 16th century.Mamadjanova, Elnora (2016). Traditional Music of the Uzbeks. Tashkent: Extremum Press. The term \\"shashmaqam\\" translates as six maqams and refers to the structure of music with six sections in different musical modes, similar to classical Persian traditional music. Interludes of spoken Sufi poetry interrupt the music, typically beginning at a low register and gradually ascending to a climax before calming back down to the beginning tone. After Turkestan became part of the Russian Empire in the 19th century, first attempts were taken to record national melodies of Turkestan. Russian musicians helped preserve these melodies by introducing musical notation in the region. In the 1950s, Uzbek folk music became less popular, and the genre was barred from radio stations by the Soviets. They did not completely dispel the music. Although banned, folk musical groups continued to play their music in their own ways and spread it individually. After Uzbekistan gained independence from the USSR in the early 1990s, public interest revived in traditional Uzbek music. Nowadays Uzbek television and radio stations regularly play traditional music. The people's Artist of Uzbekistan Turgun Alimatov is an Uzbek classical and folklore composer, and tanbur, dutar, and sato player. His compositions include \\"Segah\\", \\"Chorgoh\\", \\"Buzruk\\", \\"Navo\\", and \\"Tanovar\\". His image is associated with national pride and has been presented as the symbol of Uzbek classical music to the world.Matyakubov, O. \\"A Traditional Musician in Modern Society: A Case Study of Turgun Alimatov's Art\\". Yearbook for Traditional Music 25 (1993), pp. 60-66. Another well-known Uzbek composer is Muhammadjon Mirzayev. His most famous compositions include \\"Bahor valsi\\" (\\"The Spring Waltz\\") and \\"Sarvinoz.\\" \\"Bahor valsi\\" is played on Uzbek television and radio channels every spring. Sherali Joʻrayev is a singer of traditional Uzbek music. However, he has fallen out of favour with the Uzbek government, who have banned his performances on Uzbek TV as well as his public performances since 2002. He still performs at Uzbek wedding parties and in other countries to popular acclaim. In recent years, singers such as Yulduz Usmonova and Sevara Nazarkhan have brought Uzbek music to global audiences by mixing traditional melodies with modern rhythms and instrumentation. In the late 2000s, Ozodbek Nazarbekov mixed contemporary music with elements of traditional Uzbek music.  Western Classical music in Uzbekistan  Uzbekistan has also produced many notable composers and performers in the European classical art music idiom, and is home to notable symphony orchestras, festivals, and contemporary music ensembles.Lisack, Lucille.

The State Conservatory of Uzbekistan, based in Tashkent and founded in 1936, is the nation’s leading higher education institution for the professional training of musicians.  Contemporary music of Uzbekistan  Many forms of popular music, including folk music, pop, and rock music, have particularly flourished in Uzbekistan since the early 1990s. Uzbek pop music is well developed, and enjoys mainstream success via pop music media and various radio stations. Many Uzbek singers such as Sevara Nazarkhan and Sogdiana Fedorinskaya, Rayhon Ganieva have achieved commercial success not only in Uzbekistan but also in other CIS countries such as Kazakhstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. Rock All Tomorrow's Parties performing live at IlkhomRockFest, June 22, 2013. Currently rock music enjoys less popularity than pop music in Uzbekistan. An Uzbekistani metal band who has some degree of recognition is Night Wind, a folk metal group. Other Uzbekistani metal groups include Iced Warm, Salupa, Zindan, and Agoniya (Russian: Агония). Rap Rap music has become popular among Uzbek youth. Rappers such as Shoxrux became very popular among young people in the 2000s. However, the Uzbek government censors rap music. It has set up a special body to censor rap music because it believes this type of music does not fit the Uzbek musical culture.

It operates bus, light rail, and commuter rail services throughout the state, connecting to major commercial and employment centers both within the state and in the adjacent major cities of New York and Philadelphia. Covering a service area of , NJT is the largest statewide public transit system and the third-largest provider of bus, rail, and light rail transit by ridership in the United States.Vantuono, William C. \\"New Jersey's innovators: New Jersey Transit's billion-dollar capital budget is focused on creating a unified, statewide network of commuter and light rail lines. New technologies are a key part of that strategy\\", Railway Age, April 2004.

History A PRR GG1, built for the Pennsylvania Railroad in the 1930s–1940s, hauls a commuter train into South Amboy in 1981. NJT was founded on July 17, 1979, an offspring of the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), mandated by the state government to address many then-pressing transportation problems.New Jersey Transit 2004 Annual Report, Page 6 It came into being with the passage of the Public Transportation Act of 1979 to \\"acquire, operate, and contract for transportation service in the public interest.\\" NJT originally acquired and managed a number of private bus services, one of the largest being those operated by the state's largest electric company, Public Service Electric and Gas Company. It gradually acquired most of the state's bus services. In northern New Jersey, many of the bus routes are arranged in a web. In southern New Jersey, most routes are arranged in a \\"spoke-and-hub\\" fashion, with routes emanating from Trenton, Camden, and Atlantic City. In addition to routes run by NJT, it subsidizes and provides buses for most of the state's private operators providing fixed route or commuter service, such as Coach USA, DeCamp, Lakeland, and Academy. In 1983, NJT assumed operation of all commuter rail service in New Jersey from Conrail, which had been formed in 1976 through the merging of a number of financially troubled railroads. Conrail had operated two extensive commuter railroad networks in northern New Jersey under contract to NJDOT; in turn, these lines were the successors of numerous commuter routes dating from the mid-19th century. NJT now operates every passenger and commuter rail line in the state except for Amtrak; the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH), which is owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; the PATCO Speedline, which is owned by the Delaware River Port Authority; two SEPTA Regional Rail lines, the West Trenton Line and the Trenton Line; and a handful of tourist trains in the southern and northwestern parts of New Jersey. Since inception, rail ridership has quadrupled. In the 1990s the rail system expanded, with new Midtown Direct service to New York City and new equipment. On October 21, 2001, it opened a new station at Newark Liberty International Airport. On December 15, 2003, it opened the Secaucus Junction transfer station, connecting its two commuter networks in northern New Jersey for the first time. The new station allowed passengers on trains to Hoboken Terminal to transfer to trains to New York Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan, saving an estimated 15 minutes over connecting with PATH trains at Hoboken. On October 31, 2005, NJT took over Clocker (NY-Philadelphia) service from Amtrak. Four new trains were added to the schedule, but cut back to Trenton. During Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, the rail operations center of NJ Transit was flooded by of water and an emergency generator submerged. Floodwater damaged at least 65 locomotive engines and 257 rail cars.  Governance  The Governor of New Jersey appoints a seven-member Board of Directors, four members from the general public and three State officials. The Governor has veto power on decisions made by the board. Current operations Headquarters at Penn Plaza East in Newark NJT's operations are divided into three classes: bus, rail, and light rail, operated by three legal businesses: NJ Transit Bus Operations, Inc, for buses and Newark Light Rail, subsidiary NJ Transit Mercer, Inc. for buses around Trenton, and NJ Transit Rail Operations, Inc., for commuter rail. Bus NJT operates 871 bus routes using 2,477 busesNTD filings for New Jersey Transit (leasing out the remainder to private operators) and the Newark Light Rail with 20 light rail vehicles (with numerous other line runs being subsidized by NJT).NJT Press Release with key facts about the agency at the bottom of the page The bus fleet includes buses purchased for other New Jersey operators above the 2,477. Light rail NJT operates three light rail lines: *Hudson-Bergen Light Rail – a 24-stop multi- branch line along the Gold Coast from Bayonne to North Bergen, with a major stop at Hoboken Terminal, all in Hudson County. The fleet consists of 52 Kinki Sharyo electric light rail vehicles owned by NJT and operated under contract by 21st Century Rail. *Newark Light Rail – two segments serving Newark and the surrounding area. The Newark City Subway has 12 stops, is long, connecting Newark Penn Station to North Newark and Bloomfield. The Broad Street Extension has five stops, is long, and connects Newark Penn Station to Newark Broad Street Station. The fleet consists of 21 Kinki Sharyo electric light rail vehicles owned and operated by the Central Division of NJT Bus Operations. *River Line – a 21-stop line from Trenton to Camden along the Delaware River, mostly along the Bordentown Secondary line formerly owned by Conrail and CSX. The fleet consists of 20 Stadler GTW diesel light rail vehicles owned by NJT and operated under contract by Bombardier Transportation. Commuter rail NJT has 11 commuter rail lines: *Atlantic City Line *Bergen County Line *Main Line *Meadowlands Rail Line *Montclair-Boonton Line *Morris & Essex Lines, consisting of: **Morristown Line **Gladstone Branch *North Jersey Coast Line *Northeast Corridor Line (includes the Princeton Branch) *Pascack Valley Line *Raritan Valley Line White House station on the Raritan Valley Line Additional special event service is provided on the Meadowlands Rail Line. NJT operates over 100 diesel locomotives, of which 11 are supplied by Metro-North Railroad as part of an operating agreement for the Port Jervis Line, and 61 electric locomotives. It has over 650 push-pull cars, of which 65 are supplied by Metro-North, and 230 electric multiple unit cars. Police The New Jersey Transit Police Department (NJTPD) is the transit police agency of NJ Transit. New Jersey Transit Police operates under the authority of Chapter 27 of the NJ Revised Statutes. Title 27:25-15.1 states in part \\"The Transit Police Officers so appointed shall have general authority, without limitation, to exercise police powers and duties, as provided by law for police officers and law enforcement officers, in all criminal and traffic matters at all times throughout the State and, in addition, to enforce such rules and regulations as the corporation shall adopt and deem appropriate.\\" One of the primary responsibilities of NJ Transit Police is to provide police services and security to the hundreds of bus terminals, rail stations, light-rail stations and all other property owned, operated and leased by NJ Transit throughout the state. The Department employs approximately 250 sworn Police Officers. Projects Ongoing projects  Gateway Program  The Gateway Program is a major rail infrastructure improvement project designed to improve current services and create new capacity that will allow the doubling of passenger trains running under the Hudson River. The program will increase track, tunnel, bridge, and station capacity, eventually creating four mainline tracks between Newark, NJ, and Penn Station, New York, including a new, two- track Hudson River tunnel. It is being undertaken in partnership with Amtrak, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the State of New Jersey, and the State of New York. = Portal Bridge Replacement Project = The project would replace the existing century-old bridge swing-span bridge with a new, fixed-span bridge over the Hackensack River. The current bridge causes train traffic and delays due to maritime traffic, as well as malfunctions occurring from opening and closing. The new bridge's goal is to eliminate the movable span, improve reliability, increase train speeds, and remove conflict with maritime traffic. The project is partnered with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, NJ Transit, Amtrak, and United States Department of Transportation, with funding provided by NJ Transit, Amtrak, and the Federal Railroad Administration. = The Hudson Tunnel Project = The project is the design and construction of a new Hudson River rail tunnel serving Penn Station, New York, and the rehabilitation and modernization of the existing North River Tunnels, which incurred serious and ongoing damage during Hurricane Sandy. The tunnel was flooded with millions of gallons of saltwater during Hurricane Sandy, causing corrosion that continues to damage the century-old tunnel. It plans to build a new tunnel, rather than close and renovate the existing tunnel, as doing so would leave only one of the North River Tunnels in service, which would cause a massive reduction in rail service. As of 2018, the final design was completed and it is being advanced through the U.S. Department of Transportation TIGER grant. The project is partnered with the FRA, PANYNJ, NJ Transit and Amtrak, all of which have provided a total funding of $86.5 million.  Hudson-Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) Northern Branch Extension  The project will extend Hudson-Bergen Light Rail service from North Bergen, Hudson County to Englewood, Bergen County. The goal of the project is to meet the needs of travelers in the area, advance cost-effective transit solutions, attract growth and development in Bergen and Hudson counties, including the Hudson River Waterfront, improve regional mobility and access, reduce roadway congestion, and enhance the transit network. There have been several public hearings so far, and have received the Supplemental Draft Environmental Impact Statement from the Environmental Protection Agency. The final EIS is expected to be completed by the end of 2019.  Hudson-Bergen Light Rail (HBLR) Route 440 Extension  The project will expand Hudson-Bergen Light Rail access in Jersey City. It will extend service from West Side Avenue Station by of new rail to a new terminus on the west side of Route 440. An environmental assessment has been prepared by NJ Transit, and the Federal Transit Administration has issued a Finding of No Significance Impact (FONSI). Preliminary engineering began in 2018. The new station will be a contributing factor to the $180 million urban renewal project of Bayfront. There is also a project to improve Route 440 itself near the rail extension. Lackawanna Cut-Off In May 2001, the State of New Jersey acquired the right-of-way of the Lackawanna Cut-Off. Constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad between 1908 and 1911, this provided a direct route with minimal curves and grades between Slateford Junction, two miles (3.25 km) below the Delaware Water Gap, and the crest of the watershed at Lake Hopatcong (Port Morris Junction), the connection with NJT's Montclair-Boonton Line. This would restore long-distance service that the Erie Lackawanna last provided with the Lake Cities in 1970. At the time of the Cut-Off's construction, the DL&W; had extensive experience with concrete construction, but not on the scale that would be employed on the Cut-Off. All structures, including stations, bridges, interlocking towers and two large viaducts and thousands of fence posts, were made of concrete. Despite the lack of maintenance on these structures over the past four decades (and in some cases much longer), most are still in operational or near- operational condition. A 2009 study by NJT estimated that bringing the line back into operation to Scranton, Pennsylvania, would cost approximately $551 million, although service may be extended in several interim phases before reaching Scranton. In 2011, the retracking of the Cut-Off from Port Morris to Andover, a distance of 7.3 miles (11.8 km), began. The project was delayed by a lack of environmental permits to clear the roadbed between Lake Lackawanna and Andover. Based on current projections from NJ Transit, the restart of construction, including extensive work on Roseville Tunnel, will occur in mid- to late-2016. The re-opening of service to Andover is projected to occur in 2020. The proposed rehabilitation west of Andover, which has not yet been funded, would provide commuter rail service between Hoboken Terminal and New York's Penn Station, and would serve the growing exurban communities in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, and the Poconos, as well as northern Warren County and southern Sussex County in New Jersey. In October 2015, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requested that a preliminary engineering study be performed in order to update the cost figures on the previous study. Funding for this study is currently being sought. As of 2018, there has been progress made on the project. Glassboro–Camden Line The Glassboro–Camden Line is an diesel multiple unit (DMU) light rail system planned for southwestern part of New Jersey in the United States. At its northern end in Camden, it will connect with the River Line, with which its infrastructure and vehicles will be compatible. At the northern terminus, the Walter Rand Transportation Center, paid transfers will be possible to the PATCO Speedline. The project's goal is to improve mobility and connect towns in Gloucester and Camden counties. An environmental assessment is anticipated to be published in 2019. Bus rapid transit Bus rapid transit in New Jersey includes limited stop bus lines, exclusive bus lanes (XBL) and bus bypass shoulders (BBS). Next Generation Bus is the term used by NJT to refer to the development of numerous bus rapid transit (BRT) systems across the state which are being studied by the agency, NJDOT, the metropolitan planning organizations of New Jersey (MPO), and contract bus carriers. In 2011, NJT announced that it would equip its entire bus fleet with real-time location, creating the basis for \\"next bus\\" scheduling information at bus shelters and web-abled devices and considered an important feature of BRT.  Recovery and Resilience Projects  As of 2018, there are several projects in progress. A project to replace the auxiliary power cables, traction power, and signal and communication devices along the HBLR that were to affected by Hurricane Sandy was in the works. Repairs to Hoboken Terminal are said to be complete by 2020. Numerous power line, power system, and flood protection systems were in progress or completed at numerous terminals and stations. The 110-year old Raritan River Bridge is said to be replaced by a new higher lift bridge Proposed projects West Trenton The West Trenton Line is a proposed service connecting West Trenton Station with Newark Penn Station, connecting with the Raritan Valley Line at Bridgewater. As of 2004, NJT's estimate of the cost was $197 million.West Trenton Line, accessed December 21, 2006 To date, no funding has been secured. Service ran on the line prior to 1983. West Shore Commuter Rail Line The West Shore Route is a proposal to reactive passenger service on the New Jersey-New York section of the West Shore Railroad from Hoboken, NJ to West Nyack, NY. The project has been included in the NJ Transit's portion of the federally-designated Metropolitan Planning Organization, the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority's Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) for the fiscal years of 2016–2019. The route holds perhaps the greatest promise in all of New Jersey since it travels through the heart of NJ Transit Bus Operations' Midtown \\"commuter shed\\", with four bus routes (165, 167, 168 & 177) running well beyond capacity. Issues regarding the restart of commuter rail service include: * CSX owns the trackage and uses them heavily to link the NYC area to their national network at Selkirk Yard in upstate New York. * CSX offers to allow NJ Transit use of the ROW if the agency constructed sound barriers along the entire length of track for commuter operations out of its own pocket. * A city terminal is not connected to this line, since the Weehawken & Pavonia Terminals were demolished decades ago. A loop connecting this line with the North River Tunnels into New York Penn Station where the West Shore Tracks pass under the Northeast Corridor just south of NJ Route 3 and Tonnelle Ave would directly connect this line into New York Penn Station. This configuration would provide a 25-minute travel time to New York Penn Station, but would bypass Secaucus Junction, leaving the West Shore with no transfer connection to the rest of New Jersey other than a possible transfer station on Tonnelle Ave with the Hudson Bergen Light Rail. With these considerable technical issues, as well as no available space in New York Penn Station for West Shore Line trains, this proposal was put on hold until capacity into New York Penn Station will increase in the future. The leadership of the municipalities along the route have been organizing for decades to get service running again and have been rezoning the areas around the former train stations ever since being told by NJ Transit that the number of projected riders is too low to justify investment.

This would restore service previously provided by the Central Railroad of New Jersey with similar station sequences. Prior to 1941 cancellation the CNJ operated Blue Comet trains (Jersey City-Atlantic City) and some local trains on this route.'Official Guide of the Railways,' August 1936, Table 3 The line was originally proposed by the Ocean County Board of Chosen Freeholders in March 1980. It would run on a 40.1-mile rail corridor and would provide diesel commuter rail service from Monmouth Junction (South Brunswick), where the Jamesburg Branch partially joins the Northeast Corridor (NEC), south to Lakehurst in the interior of northern Ocean County. As of 2006, the line was opposed by Jamesburg and Monroe Township. From Monmouth Junction the line would continue southeast to Jamesburg, Monroe, Englishtown, Manalapan, Freehold Borough, Freehold Township, Howell and Farmingdale. A new rail connection would be required in Farmingdale. It would proceed southward from Farmingdale to Lakehurst, passing through Howell, Lakewood, Jackson, Toms River, Townships, and Lakehurst/Manchester. Trains would also operate on the NEC between Monmouth Junction and Newark. Passengers for New York would transfer at Newark. Eight new stations and a train storage yard would be constructed. In mid-February 2008, New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine withdrew the Monmouth Junction alignment from the MOM Plan. Corzine opted to endorse the two remaining alternate alignments (via Red Bank or Matawan-Freehold, the latter which is currently part of the Henry Hudson Rail Trail). NJT is still planning to study all the routes as to not delay action further on the EIS, and says all three routes are still up for evaluation, although it will take the Governor's comments into consideration. In late May 2009 representatives of the three counties agreed to back one potential route from Ocean County to Red Bank, instead of to Monmouth Junction, ending years of stalemate. Under that compromise, the line's southern terminus would be in Lakehurst, and it would run through Lakewood along existing freight tracks to join the North Jersey Coast Line in Red Bank. It also includes the possibility of a spur between Freehold and Farmingdale.New Jersey News  The Asbury Park Press NJ. app.com. Retrieved on June 23, 2014.

The constitution itself required that it be provided to school children at the time of their graduation. The Constitution of the German Reich (), usually known as the Weimar Constitution (Weimarer Verfassung), was the constitution that governed Germany during the Weimar Republic era (1919–1933). The constitution declared Germany to be a democratic parliamentary republic with a legislature elected under proportional representation. Universal suffrage was established, with a minimum voting age of 20. The constitution technically remained in effect throughout the Nazi era from 1933 to 1945, though practically it went unenforced. The constitution's title was the same as the Constitution of the German Empire that preceded it. The German state's official name was Deutsches Reich until the adoption of the 1949 Basic Law.  Origin  Following the end of World War I, a German National Assembly gathered in the town of Weimar, in the state of Thuringia, after the 19 January 1919 Federal elections, in order to write a constitution for the Reich. The nation was to be a democratic federal republic, governed by a president and parliament. The constitution was drafted by the lawyer and liberal politician Hugo Preuss, who was then state secretary in the Ministry of the Interior, and later became Minister of the Interior. Preuss criticised the Triple Entente's decision to prohibit the incorporation of German Austria into the German Republic after the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and said it was a contradiction of the Wilsonian principle of self-determination of peoples.PREUSS DENOUNCES DEMAND OF ALLIES, The New York Times, September 14, 1919 Disagreements arose between the delegates over issues such as the national flag, religious education for youth and the rights of the provinces (Länder) that made up the Reich. The disagreements were resolved by August 1919, but 65 delegates abstained from voting to adopt the Weimar Constitution. The first President, Friedrich Ebert, signed the new German constitution into law on 11 August 1919. The constitution is named after Weimar although it was signed into law by Friedrich Ebert in Schwarzburg because Ebert was on holiday in Schwarzburg while the parliament working out the constitution was gathered in Weimar. Federal elections were held in Germany on 6 June 1920 in line with the Weimar Constitution.Nohlen, D & Stöver, P (2010) Elections in Europe: A data handbook, p. 762 Gerhard Anschütz (1867–1948), a noted German teacher of constitutional law, was a prominent commentator of the Weimar Constitution.  Provisions and organization  The Weimar Constitution was divided into two main parts (Hauptteile). The two parts were divided into seven and five sections, respectively. In all, there were over 180 articles in the Constitution. Some of the more noteworthy provisions are described below, including those provisions which proved significant in the demise of the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazi Germany. The preamble to the Constitution reads: > Das Deutsche Volk einig in seinen Stämmen und von dem Willen beseelt, sein > Reich in Freiheit und Gerechtigkeit zu erneuen und zu festigen, dem inneren > und dem äußeren Frieden zu dienen und den gesellschaftlichen Fortschritt zu > fördern, hat sich diese Verfassung gegeben. In English, this can be translated as: > The German people, united in its tribes and inspired with the will to renew > and strengthen its realm (Reich) in liberty and justice, to serve internal > and external peace, and to promote social progress, has adopted this > Constitution.  Main Part I: Composition of the Reich and its Responsibility  The first part (Erster Hauptteil) of the Constitution specified the organization of the various components of the Reich government.  Section 1: The Reich and its States  Section 1 consisted of Articles 1 to 19 and established the German Reich as a republic whose power derived from the people. (\\"The power of the state emanates from the people.\\") The Reich was defined as the region encompassed by the German states (Länder), and other regions could join the Reich based on popular self-determination and Reich legislation. Section 1 also established that generally recognized principles of international law were binding on Germany and gave the Reich government exclusive jurisdiction of: * foreign relations, colonial affairs, citizenship * freedom of movement * immigration, emigration, and extradition. * defense * customs and trade * currency and coinage * postal, telegraph, and telephone service With the exceptions of the subjects for which the Reich government had exclusive jurisdiction, the states could govern their respective territories as they saw fit. However, Reich law superseded or nullified state law in the event of a conflict. Adjudication of conflicts between the Länder and the Reich government was the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. State authorities were required to enforce Reich law and must have a constitution on free state principles. Each state parliament (Landtag) was to be elected by an equal and secret ballot according to representative election. Each state government could serve only so long as it had the confidence of the respective state parliament.  Section 2: The Reichstag and the Reich Government  Articles 20 to 40 described the national parliament, the Reichstag, which was seated in the capital, Berlin. The Reichstag was composed of representatives elected by the German people by an equal and secret ballot open to all Germans aged 20 or older. Proportional representation principles governed Reichstag elections. Members of the Reichstag represented the entire nation and were bound only to their own conscience. Members served for four years. The Reichstag could be dissolved by the Reich president and new elections held not more than 60 days after the date of dissolution. Members of the Reichstag and of each state parliament (Landtag) were immune from arrest or investigation of a criminal offense except with the approval of the legislative body to which the person belonged. The same approval was required for any other restriction on personal freedom which might harm the member's ability to fulfil his duties. (Article 37) The President served a term of seven years and could be re-elected once. He could be removed from office by plebiscite upon the vote of two-thirds of the Reichstag. Rejection of the measure by the voters would act as a re-election of the president and causes the Reichstag to be dissolved. If a state failed to fulfil its obligations under the constitution or Reich law, the president could use armed force to compel the state to do so. Furthermore, Article 48 gave the President the power to take measures – including the use of armed force and/or the suspension of civil rights – to restore law and order in the event of a serious threat to public safety or Reich security. The president was required to inform the Reichstag of these measures and the Reichstag could nullify such a presidential decree. (Adolf Hitler later used this Article to legally sweep away the civil liberties granted in the constitution and facilitate the establishment of a dictatorship.) The Reich chancellor determined the political guidelines of his government and was responsible to the Reichstag. The chancellor and ministers were compelled to resign in the event the Reichstag passed a vote of no confidence. The Reich government (cabinet) formulated decisions by majority vote; in the case of a tie, the Reich president's vote was decisive. The Reichstag could accuse the Reich president, chancellor, or any minister of willful violation of the Constitution or Reich law, said case to be tried in the Supreme Court.  Section 3: The President of the Reich and the National Ministry  Articles 41 to 59 describe the duties of the President, including criteria for the office. Furthermore, they also further explain his relationship to the National Ministry and its relation to the Chancellor.  Section 4: The Reichsrat  Section 4 consisted of Articles 60 to 67 and established the Reichsrat (State Council). The Reichsrat was the means by which the states could participate in the making of legislation at the national level. Members of the Reichsrat were members or representatives of the state parliaments, and were bound by the instructions of their respective state governments. Government ministers were required to inform the Reichsrat of proposed legislation or administrative regulations to permit the Reichsrat to voice objections.  Section 5: Reich legislation  Articles 68 to 77 specified how legislation is to be passed into law. Laws could be proposed by a member of the Reichstag or by the Reich government and were passed on the majority vote of the Reichstag. Proposed legislation had to be presented to the Reichsrat, and the latter body's objections were required to be presented to the Reichstag. The Reich president had the power to decree that a proposed law be presented to the voters as a plebiscite before taking effect. The Reichsrat was entitled to object to laws passed by the Reichstag. If this objection could not be resolved, the Reich president at his discretion could call for a plebiscite or let the proposed law die. If the Reichstag voted to overrule the Reichsrat's objection by a two-thirds majority, the Reich president was obligated to either proclaim the law into force or to call for a plebiscite. Constitutional amendments were proposed as ordinary legislation, but for such an amendment to take effect, it was required that two-thirds or more of the Reichstag members be present, and that at least two-thirds of the members present voted in favor of the legislation. The Reich government had the authority to establish administrative regulations unless Reich law specified otherwise.  Section 6: Reich administration  Articles 78 to 101 described the methods by which the Reich government administered the constitution and laws, particularly in the areas where the Reich government had exclusive jurisdiction – foreign relations, colonial affairs, defence, taxation and customs, merchant shipping and waterways, railroads, and so forth.  Section 7: Justice  Articles 102 to 108 established the justice system of the Weimar Republic. The principal provision established judicial independence – judges were subject only to the law. This section established a Supreme Court and also established administrative courts to adjudicate disputes between citizens and administrative offices of the state.  Main Part II: Basic rights and obligations of Germans  The second part (Zweiter Hauptteil) of the Weimar Constitution laid out the basic rights (Grundrechte) and basic obligations (Grundpflichten) of Germans. The constitution guaranteed individual rights such as the freedom of speech and assembly to each citizen. These were based on the provisions of the earlier constitution of 1848.  Section 1: The Individual  Articles 109 to 118 set forth individual rights of Germans, the principal tenet being that every German was equal before the law. Both genders had the same rights and obligations. Privileges based on birth or social status were abolished. Official recognition of the titles of nobility ceased, except as a part of a person's name, and further creation of noble titles was discontinued. A citizen of any of the German provinces was likewise a citizen of the Reich. Germans had the right of mobility and residence, and the right to acquire property and pursue a trade. They had the right to immigrate or emigrate, and the right to Reich protection against foreign authorities. The \\"national identity\\" of foreign language communities in Germany was protected, including the right to use their native language in education, administration, and the judicial system. Other specific articles stated that: * The rights of the individual are inviolable. Individual liberties may be limited or deprived only on the basis of law. Persons have the right to be notified within a day of their arrest or detention as to the authority and reasons for their detention and be given the opportunity to object. This is equivalent to the principle of habeas corpus in the common law of England and elsewhere. (Article 114) * A German's home is an asylum and is inviolable. (Article 115) * Privacy of correspondence, of mail, telegraph, and telephone are inviolable. (Article 117) * Germans are entitled to free expression of opinion in word, writing, print, image, etc. This right cannot be obstructed by job contract, nor can exercise of this right create a disadvantage. Censorship is prohibited. (Article 118)  Section 2: Community Life  Articles 119 to 134 guided Germans' interaction with the community and established, among other things, that: * Germans had the right to assemble peacefully and unarmed without prior permission. (Article 123) * Germans were entitled to form clubs or societies, which were permitted to acquire legal status. This status could not be denied because of the organization's political, socio-political or religious goals. (Article 124) * Free and secret elections were guaranteed. (Article 125) * All citizens were eligible for public office, without discrimination, based on their abilities. Gender discrimination toward female civil servants was abolished (Article 128). This allowed the first women, like Anita Augspurg to practice law. * Civil servants served the whole nation, not a specific party. They enjoyed freedom of political opinion. (Article 130) * Citizens could be required to provide services to the state and community, including compulsory military service under regulations set by Reich law.  Section 3: Religion and Religious Communities  The religious rights of Germans were enumerated in Articles 135 to 141. Residents of the Reich were granted freedom of belief and conscience. Free practice of religion was guaranteed by the constitution and protected by the state, and no state church was established. Furthermore, the exercise of civil and civic rights and admission to state office were independent of one's religious beliefs. Public declaration of religious beliefs were not required, and no one was forced to join in a religious act or swear a religious oath. Five articles from this section of the Constitution (Nos. 136–139 and 141) were explicitly incorporated into the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany (passed in 1949), and so remain Constitutional Law in Germany today.  Section 4: Education and School  Articles 142 to 150 guided the operation of educational institutions within the Reich. Public education was provided by state institutions and regulated by the government, with cooperation between the Reich, the province, and the local community. Primary school was compulsory, with advanced schooling available to age 18 free of charge. The constitution also provided for private schooling, which was likewise regulated by the government. In private schools operated by religious communities, religious instruction could be taught in accordance with the religious community's principles.  Section 5: The Economy  Constitutional provisions about economic affairs were given in Articles 151 to 165. One of the fundamental principles was that economic life should conform to the principles of justice, with the goal of achieving a dignified life for all and securing the economic freedom of the individual. The right to property was guaranteed by Article 153. Expropriation of property could be made only on the basis of law and for the public welfare, with appropriate compensation. The Reich protected labor, intellectual creation, and the rights of authors, inventors, and artists. The right to form unions and to improve working conditions was guaranteed to every individual and to all occupations, and protection of the self-employed was established. Workers and employees were given the right to participate, on an equal footing with employers, in the regulation of wages and working conditions as well as in economic development.  Transition and Final Clauses  The final 16 articles (Articles 166 to 181) of the Weimar Constitution provided for the orderly transition to the new constitution, and stipulated in some cases when the various provisions of the new constitution take effect. In cases where legislation had yet to be passed (such as the laws governing the new Supreme Court), these articles stipulated how the constitutional authority would be exercised in the interim by existing institutions. This section also stipulated that new bodies established by the constitution took the place of obsolete bodies (such as the National Assembly) where those bodies were referred to by name in old laws or decrees. It was mandated that public servants and members of the armed forces were to take an oath on this constitution. The previous constitution, dated 15 April 1871, was suspended but other Reich laws and decrees that did not contradict the new constitution remained in force. Other official decrees based on hitherto-valid law remained valid until superseded by law or by decree. The National Assembly was regarded as the Reichstag until the first Reichstag was elected and convened, and the Reich president elected by the National Assembly was to serve until 30 June 1925. Weaknesses In his book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, historian William L. Shirer described the Weimar Constitution as \\"on paper, the most liberal and democratic document of its kind the twentieth century had ever seen ... full of ingenious and admirable devices which seemed to guarantee the working of an almost flawless democracy.\\" Yet, the Weimar Constitution had serious problems. The allocation of presidential powers was deeply problematic. The Weimar Constitution allowed the president to dismiss the chancellor, even if the chancellor retained the confidence of the Reichstag. Similarly, the president could appoint a chancellor who did not have the support of the Reichstag. Further, the government structure was a mix of presidential and parliamentary systems, with the president acting as a \\"replacement Kaiser\\" and assuming some of the powers the monarch would have wielded. Article 48, the so-called Notverordnung (emergency decree) provision, gave the president broad powers to suspend civil liberties with an insufficient system of checks and balances. This presented an opportunity that Adolf Hitler was quick to seize once he became chancellor (see Reichstag fire). The use of a proportional electoral system without thresholds to win representation has also been cited. This system, intended to avoid the wasting of votes, allowed the rise of a multitude of splinter parties, many of which represented the extreme ends of the political spectrum, which in turn made it difficult for any party to establish and maintain a workable parliamentary majority. This factionalism was one contributing factor in the frequent changes in government. Shirer cites the presence of some 28 political parties in the 1930 national elections; Otto Friedrich cites 40 different groups in the Reichstag in 1933. There was no threshold to win representation in the Reichstag, and hence no safeguard against a quick rise of an extremist party. It was possible to win a seat in the chamber with as little as 0.4 percent of the vote. In the 1924 elections, for instance, the Bavarian Peasants' League got just 0.7% of the vote—but this was enough for three seats in the Reichstag. However, the rise of the Nazis (NSDAP) to form the largest party during the 1932 elections, can only be attributed to the sentiment of electors in Weimar Germany. Critics of electoral thresholds dispute the argument that the Nazis' token presence in the Reichstags of the 1920s significantly aided their rise to power and that the existence of thresholds in the Weimar constitution would not in fact have hindered Hitler's ambitions—indeed, once the Nazis had passed the thresholds, their existence would have actually aided the Nazis by allowing them to marginalize smaller parties even more quickly. Even without these real and/or perceived problems, the Weimar Constitution was established and in force under disadvantageous social, political, and economic conditions. In his book The Coming of the Third Reich, historian Richard J. Evans argues that \\"all in all, Weimar's constitution was no worse than the constitutions of most other countries in the 1920s, and a good deal more democratic than many. Its more problematical provisions might not have mattered so much had the circumstances been different. But the fatal lack of legitimacy from which the Republic suffered magnified the constitution's faults many times over.\\"Evans, Richard J (2004): The Coming of the Third Reich; New York, The Penguin Press, p. 88.  Hitler's subversion of the Weimar Constitution  Less than a month after Adolf Hitler’s appointment as chancellor in 1933, the Reichstag Fire Decree invoked Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution, suspending several constitutional protections on civil rights. The articles affected were 114 (habeas corpus), 115 (inviolability of residence), 117 (correspondence privacy), 118 (freedom of expression /censorship), 123 (assembly), 124 (associations), and 153 (expropriation). The subsequent Enabling Act, passed by the Reichstag on 23 March 1933, stated that, in addition to the traditional method of the Reichstag passing legislation, the Reich government could also pass legislation. It further stated that the powers of the Reichstag, Reichsrat and Reich President were not affected. The normal legislative procedures outlined in Articles 68 to 77 of the constitution did not apply to legislation promulgated by the Reich government. The Enabling Act was effectively a constitutional amendment because of the foregoing alterations to the normal legislative process. The act met the constitutional requirements (two-thirds of the Reichstag's members were present, and two-thirds of the members present voted in favor of the measure). The Act did not explicitly amend the Weimar Constitution, but there was explicit mention to the fact that the procedure sufficient for constitutional reform was followed. The constitution of 1919 was never formally repealed, but the Enabling Act meant that all its other provisions were a dead letter. Two of the penultimate acts Hitler took to consolidate his power in 1934 actually violated the Enabling Act. Article 2 of the act stated that > Laws enacted by the government of the Reich may deviate from the > constitution as long as they do not affect the institutions of the Reichstag > and the Reichsrat. The rights of the President remain undisturbed. Hindenburg died on 2 August, and Hitler appropriated the president's powers for himself in accordance with a law passed the previous day. However, due to a constitutional amendment made in December 1932, the acting president, pending new elections, should have been Erwin Bumke, the president of the Reichsgericht (Imperial Court of Justice), not the chancellor. Nonetheless, the Enabling Act did not specify any recourse that could be taken if the chancellor violated Article 2, and no legal challenge was ever mounted. Legacy After the passage of the Enabling Act, the constitution was largely forgotten. Nonetheless, Hitler used it to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality. Three Reichstag elections were held during his rule. However, voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and \\"guest candidates\\". Secret voting technically remained possible, but the Nazis made use of aggressive extralegal measures at the polling stations to intimidate the electors from attempting to vote in secret. Thousands of his decrees were based explicitly on the Reichstag Fire Decree, and hence on Article 48. In Hitler's 1945 political testament (written shortly before his suicide), he appointed Admiral Karl Dönitz to succeed him. However, he named Dönitz as President, not Führer, thereby re-establishing a constitutional office which had lain dormant since Hindenburg's death ten years earlier. On 30 April 1945, Dönitz formed what became known as the Flensburg government, which controlled only a tiny area of Germany near the Danish border, including the town of Flensburg. It was dissolved by the Allies on 23 May. On 5 June, the Allied Berlin Declaration abolished all the institutions of German civil government, and this established that the constitution no longer held any legal force. The 1949 Constitution of the German Democratic Republic (otherwise known as East Germany) contained many passages that were directly copied from the 1919 constitution.Markovits, Inga. \\"Constitution Making After National Catastrophes: Germany in 1949 and 1990\\", William & Mary Law Review. Volume 49. Issue 4. Article 9 (2008). pp. 1307–1346. It was intended to be the constitution of a united Germany, and was thus a compromise between liberal- democratic and Marxist–Leninist ideologies. It was replaced by a new, explicitly Communist constitution in 1968, which remained in force until the reunification of Germany in 1990. The Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, enacted in 1949, said \\"provisions of Articles 136, 137, 138, 139 and 141 of the German Constitution of 11 August 1919 shall be an integral part of this Basic Law\\".See Article 140 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (last amended on 23 December 2014), p. 126. These articles of the Weimar constitution (which dealt with the state's relationship to the different Christian denominations) remain part of the German Basic Law. In the judicial system based on the Basic Law, the Weimar constitution initially retained the force of law (with the exception of the Church articles on a non- constitutional level), where the Basic Law contained nothing to the contrary. These norms were, however, largely redundant or dealing with matters reserved to the Länder, and as such officially set out of force within two decades; aside from the Church articles, the rule that titles of nobility are to be considered part of the name and must no longer be bestowed (Art. 109 III) is the only one left in force.Die Verfassung des Deutschen Reichs.

McCullagh, author of Tim and the Hidden People. A long series of early readers based on the stories was produced by Ladybird Books, also under the title Puddle Lane. TV programme The programme was made by Yorkshire Television in Leeds for ITV and ran on from 1985 (as a replacement for the then-recently discontinued series Mooncat & Co.) until 1989. The main characters were the Magician (played by Neil Innes, who also composed music for the programme), and a Spell Dragon named Toby (voiced by Richard Robinson); the Magician told Toby stories by moving his finger around in a puddle (when using the interior set) and a bird bath (when using the exterior set) and producing images. He also had a cauldron inside and water barrel outside, both of which could talk. The stories he told were presented as animations, narrated by Kate Lee (who also played a minor character, Aunt Flo). The Magician lived in a large house at the end of Puddle Lane, hence the name of the programme. In an interview in 2014, Neil Innes recalled his involvement with Puddle Lane: Transmission guide *Series 1: 26 editions from 3 October 1985 – 1 May 1986 *Series 2: 26 editions from 16 October 1986 – 23 April 1987 *Series 3: 24 editions from 29 October 1987 – 21 April 1988 *Series 4: 26 editions from 6 October 1988 – 13 April 1989 International Broadcast * Australia ** ABC TV * Brunei ** RTB Books A series of 54 books (plus two standalone volumes) was produced for Puddle Lane, published by Ladybird Books.

There were five sets of books (with a different cover colour for each set), the first set (Stage 1) being the easiest to read and the last set (Stage 5) being the hardest. Since they were intended for children who are learning to read, the books with lower reading stages would present the text in two versions: the left page contained the full version, to be read aloud by the parent, while the right page contained a simplified version for the child. The books are currently out of print.

Clan of Xymox featured a trio of songwriters – Ronny Moorings, Anka Wolbert, and Pieter Nooten – and gained success in the 1980s, releasing their first two albums on 4AD, before releasing their third and fourth albums on Wing Records and scoring a hit single in the United States. Their 1980s releases included synthpop/electronic dance music. The band is still active, continuing to tour and release records with Moorings the sole remaining original songwriter. History 4AD and the Peel Sessions (1981–1988) The band formed as a project of Ronny Moorings and Anka Wolbert in Nijmegen, Netherlands in 1981, before moving to Amsterdam and joining Frank Weyzig and Pieter Nooten who added their own contributions. Assuming the name \\"Xymox\\", the group released a mini-album, Subsequent Pleasures, in 1983. They were invited by Brendan Perry to support Dead Can Dance on a UK tour and were signed to the indie label 4AD, which released their eponymous debut album in 1985. The track 7th Time, with Anka Wolbert on lead vocals, was picked up by John Peel, leading to the band recording two of the Peel Sessions at the BBC, in June and November 1985. Peel referred to the band's dark and melancholic sound as \\"darkwave\\". In 1986, they released their second and last album on 4AD, Medusa, before signing with PolyGram. Simultaneously, Pieter Nooten recorded and released his album Sleeps with the Fishes (4AD, 1987), in collaboration with Canadian session musician Michael Brook. In a 2010 interview with AlterNation Magazine, Moorings expressed disappointment at the divided interests of the band members at this stage, exclaiming Medusa's follow-up album was \\"made entirely independently, without the rest of the musicians, who were then on vacation.\\" PolyGram and international success (1988–1991) Ronny Moorings, Anka Wolbert and Pieter Nooten, 1991 Now abbreviated as Xymox, the band's third album, Twist of Shadows, was released in 1989. This album, and its successor Phoenix, were released by Wing Records, a subsidiary of Polydor Records/PolyGram. In the United States, these two albums created a cult following for the band. The first two singles taken from the Twist of Shadows album, \\"Blind Hearts\\" and \\"Obsession\\", proved college and club hits in the United States, with Obsession charting on Billboards Alternative Songs chart and both tracks hitting the Billboard Club Play Chart. It was the album's third single, \\"Imagination\\" (with Anka Wolbert on lead vocals), that brought the band the most mainstream attention, charting at No. 85 on Billboard Hot 100, generating Top 40 radio airplay and MTV rotation of the \\"Imagination (Edit)\\" single video. Twist of Shadows proved their most commercially successful album, selling more than 300,000 copies worldwide. By this time the band had moved to England and released their fourth album, Phoenix, on PolyGram in 1991; after this album, Anka Wolbert and Pieter Nooten left the band due to disagreements about the band's musical direction. Independent labels and move to Germany (1991–2020) Ronny Moorings of Clan of Xymox in concert in 2008, in Orlando, Florida Xymox, without Nooten and Wolbert, left PolyGram to release the UK acid house inspired LPs Metamorphosis (1992) and Headclouds (1993) independently. These albums marked a break from the dark wave sound of the 1980s and met with poor record sales in the United States, which had moved towards a markedly different grunge sound at the time. Ronny Moorings toured under the banner of Xymox until 1994 with an evolving cast of live musicians, including girlfriend and future band member Mojca Zugna. Frank Weyzig (the last of the original line-up) parted ways with Moorings after the 1994 tour, after which Moorings moved back to the Netherlands and took a three-year hiatus from music-writing. Capitalizing on a resurgence in the popularity of gothic rock and the success of bands such as Nine Inch Nails and Rammstein, 1997 saw Moorings reverting the name to Clan of Xymox and moving to Germany – then the center of the burgeoning industrial music scene – to resume songwriting. Moorings recruited new live members and signed with the independent US label Tess Records in 1997 then with Metropolis in 1998. The LPs Hidden Faces (1997), Creatures (1999) and Notes from the Underground (2001) reflect an increasingly electro sound while maintaining the distinctive dance rhythms associated with the Clan of Xymox catalog. In 1998, 4AD re-released Clan of Xymox and Medusa in the US, and Xymox toured the United States the following year. 2003's FareWell featured several charting tracks internationally. Most recently, the LP Matters of Mind, Body and Soul was released on Trisol, Metropolis and Gravitator record labels for European, American and Russian distribution, respectively, in February 2014. In addition to intermittent original releases, Clan of Xymox has contributed to a number of compilations and side projects since conception. In 1987, the track \\"Moscoviet Mosquito\\" was re-recorded and released on the 4AD compilation album Lonely Is an Eyesore. In October 2000 the band released Live, a double CD with nineteen tracks and two videos featuring live performances of Xymox songs from the 4AD, Polygram, and independent eras. In September 2004, a Best of Clan of Xymox album was released with re-recorded versions of early hits as well as later offerings. In 2011, the track \\"In Your Arms Again\\" from the LP Darkest Hour was included on the soundtrack to David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. In 2012 the band released a cover album, Kindred Spirits, featuring covers of several influential post-punk and new wave groups in Mooring's own musical styling. The songs \\"A Day\\", \\"Masquerade\\", and \\"Cry in the Wind\\" were featured on the official soundtrack to the 2014 film The Guest. In a touring capacity, Clan of Xymox is best known as a headlining act for several annual international alternative music festivals, including M'era Luna Festival in Hildesheim, Germany, Triton Festival in New York City, Summer Darkness in Utrecht, Netherlands, Whitby Gothic Weekend in Whitby, England, and the largest – Wave-Gotik-Treffen, in Moorings' current home of Leipzig, Germany.

It was recorded at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas and Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia between July and August 1980 and produced by longtime collaborator Brian Eno. Following the release of their previous album Fear of Music in 1979, the quartet and Eno sought to dispel notions of the band as a mere vehicle for frontman and songwriter David Byrne. Drawing on the influence of Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, the band experimented with African polyrhythms, funk, and electronics, recording instrumental tracks as a series of looping grooves. The sessions incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist Adrian Belew, singer Nona Hendryx, and trumpet player Jon Hassell. Byrne struggled with writer's block, but adopted a scattered, stream-of-consciousness lyrical style inspired by early rap and academic literature on Africa. The artwork for the album was conceived by bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz, and was crafted with the help of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's computers and design company M&Co.; The band expanded to nine members for a promotional tour, and following its completion, they went on hiatus for several years, leaving the individual members to pursue side projects. Remain in Light was widely acclaimed by critics, who praised its sonic experimentation, rhythmic innovations, and cohesive merging of disparate genres. The album peaked at number nineteen on the US Billboard 200 and number 21 on the UK Albums Chart, and spawned the singles \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" and \\"Houses in Motion\\". It has been featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1980s and of all time, and is often considered Talking Heads' magnum opus. In 2017, the Library of Congress deemed the album \\"culturally, historically, or artistically significant\\",The story of the 1980 album \\"Remain in Light\\" by Talking Heads and Brian Eno-Inside the National Recording Registry-Studio 360-WNYC and selected it for preservation in the National Recording Registry. Background In January 1980, the members of Talking Heads returned to New York City after the tours in support of their 1979 critically acclaimed third album, Fear of Music, and took time off to pursue personal interests. Singer David Byrne worked with Brian Eno, the record's producer, on an experimental album, My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. Keyboardist Jerry Harrison produced an album for soul singer Nona Hendryx at the Sigma Sound Studios branch in New York City; Hendryx and the studio were used during the Remain in Light recording on Harrison's advice.Bowman, p. 165 Drummer Chris Frantz and bassist Tina Weymouth, a married couple, discussed leaving Talking Heads after Weymouth suggested that Byrne was too controlling.Bowman, p. 164 Frantz did not want to leave, and the two took a long vacation in the Caribbean to ponder the state of the band and their marriage. They became involved in Haitian Vodou religious ceremonies, practised native percussion instruments, and socialised with the reggae rhythm section of Sly and Robbie. Frantz and Weymouth ended their holiday by purchasing an apartment above Compass Point Studios in Nassau, the Bahamas, where Talking Heads had recorded their second album, More Songs About Buildings and Food. Byrne joined the duo and Harrison there in early 1980.Bowman, p. 167 The band members realised that it had been solely up to Byrne to craft songs even though they were performed as a quartet. They had tired of the notion of a singer leading a backup band; the ideal they aimed for, according to Byrne, was \\"sacrificing our egos for mutual cooperation\\".Pareles, p. 38 Byrne additionally wanted to escape \\"the psychological paranoia and personal torment\\" he had been writing and feeling in New York. Instead of the band writing music to Byrne's lyrics, Talking Heads performed instrumental jams, using the Fear of Music song \\"I Zimbra\\" as a starting point. Eno arrived in the Bahamas three weeks after Byrne. He was reluctant to work with the band again after collaborating on the previous two albums. He changed his mind after being excited by the instrumental demo tapes. The band and Eno experimented with the communal African way of making music, in which individual parts mesh as polyrhythms. Afrodisiac, the 1973 Afrobeat record by Nigerian musician Fela Kuti, became the template for the album. Weymouth said that the beginnings of hip-hop music made Talking Heads realise that the musical landscape was changing. Before the studio sessions began, longtime friend David Gans instructed the band that \\"the things one doesn't intend are the seeds for a more interesting future\\". He encouraged them to experiment, improvise and make use of \\"mistakes\\". Recording and production Brian Eno, here photographed in 2007, produced Remain in Light using stylised methods and sonic experiments. Recording sessions started at Compass Point Studios in July 1980. The album's creation required the use of additional musicians, particularly percussionists. Talking Heads used the working title Melody Attack throughout the studio process after watching a Japanese game show of the same name.Bowman, p. 169 Harrison said the ambition was to blend rock and African genres, rather than simply imitate African music. Eno's production techniques and personal approach were key to the record's conception. The process was geared to promote the expression of instinct and spontaneity without overtly focusing on the sound of the final product. Eno compared the creative process to \\"looking out to the world and saying, 'What a fantastic place we live in. Let's celebrate it.'\\" Sections and instrumentals were recorded one at a time in a discontinuous process. Loops played a key part at a time when computers could not yet adequately perform such functions. Talking Heads developed Remain in Light by recording jams, isolating the best parts, and learning to play them repetitively. The basic tracks focused wholly on rhythms and were all performed in a minimalist method using only one chord. Each section was recorded as a long loop to enable the creation of compositions through the positioning or merging of loops in different ways. Byrne likened the process to modern sampling: \\"We were human samplers.\\" After a few sessions in the Bahamas, engineer Rhett Davies left following an argument with the producer over the fast speed of recording. Steven Stanley, who since the age of 17 had engineered for musicians such as Bob Marley, stepped in to cover the workload.Bowman, p. 168 He is credited by Frantz with helping create \\"Once in a Lifetime\\", which was released as a single. A Lexicon 224 digital reverb effects unit, obtained by engineer and mixer Dave Jerden, was used on the album. The machine was one of the first of its kind and able to simulate environments such as echo chambers and rooms through interchangeable programs. Like Davies, Jerden was unhappy with the fast pace at which Eno wanted to record sonically complicated compositions, but did not complain. The tracks made Byrne rethink his vocal style and he tried singing to the instrumental songs, but sounded \\"stilted\\". Few vocal sections were recorded in the Bahamas. The writing process for the lyrics occurred when the band returned to the US and was split between New York City and California.Bowman, p. 374 Harrison booked Talking Heads into Sigma Sound, which focused primarily on R&B; music, after convincing the owners that the band's work could bring them a new type of clientele. In New York City, Byrne struggled with writer's block. Harrison and Eno spent their time tweaking the compositions recorded in the Bahamas, while Frantz and Weymouth often did not show up at the studio. Doubts began to surface about whether the album would be completed. The recording sessions only built up pace after the recruitment of guitarist Adrian Belew at the request of Byrne, Harrison and Eno. He was advised to add guitar solos to the Compass Point tracks, making use of a Roland guitar synthesiser.Bowman, p. 170 Byrne recorded all the tracks, as they were after Belew had performed on them, to a cassette and looked to Africa to break his writer's block. He realised that, when African musicians forget words, they often improvise and make new ones up. He used a portable tape recorder and tried to create onomatopoeic rhymes in the style of Eno, who believed that lyrics were never the center of a song's meaning. Byrne continuously listened to his recorded scatting until convinced that he was no longer \\"hearing nonsense\\".Bowman, p. 171 After he was satisfied, Harrison invited Nona Hendryx to Sigma Sound to record backing vocals for the album. She was advised extensively on her vocal delivery by Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth, and often sang in a trio with Byrne and Eno.Bowman, p. 175 The voice sessions were followed by the overdubbing process. Brass player Jon Hassell, who had been working on parts of My Life in the Bush of Ghosts, was hired to perform trumpet and horn sections. In August 1980, half of the album was mixed by Eno and engineer John Potoker in New York City with the assistance of Harrison, while the other half was mixed by Byrne and Jerden at Eldorado Studios in Los Angeles.Bowman, p. 179 Music and lyrics The testimony of Watergate scandal conspirator John Dean was one of several inspirations for the lyrics on Remain in Light. Remain in Light features new wave, post-punk, worldbeat, dance-rock, art pop, art rock, avant-pop, and different types of funk, specifically afrofunk and psychedelic funk. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the album as a \\"dense amalgam of African percussion, funk bass and keyboards, pop songs, and electronics.\\" It contains eight songs that possess a \\"striking free-associative feel\\" according to psychoanalyst Michael A. Brog, in that there is no long-lasting coherent thought process that can be followed in the stream-of-consciousness lyrics. David Gans instructed Byrne to be freer with his lyrical content by advising him that \\"rational thinking has its limits\\".Brog, p. 166 The frontman included a bibliography with the album press kit along with a statement that explained how the album was inspired by African mythologies and rhythms. The release stressed that the major inspiration to the lyrics was Professor John Miller Chernoff's African Rhythm and African Sensibility,Bowman, p. 182 which examined the musical enhancement of life in the continent's rural communities. The academic travelled to Ghana in 1970 to study native percussion and wrote about how Africans have complicated conversations through drum patterns.Bowman, p. 173 One of the songs, \\"The Great Curve\\", exemplifies the African theme by including the line \\"The world moves on a woman's hips\\", which Byrne used after reading Professor Robert Farris Thompson's book African Art in Motion. He also studied straight speech, from John Dean's Watergate testimony to the stories of African American former slaves. Like all the other tracks, album opener \\"Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)\\" borrows from \\"preaching, shouting and ranting\\". The expression \\"And the Heat Goes On\\", used in the title and repeated in the chorus, is based on a New York Post headline Eno read in the summer of 1980 whilst Byrne rewrote the song title \\"Don't Worry About the Government\\" from Talking Heads' debut album, Talking Heads: 77, into the lyric \\"Look at the hands of a government man\\". The \\"rhythmical rant\\" in \\"Crosseyed and Painless\\"—\\"Facts are simple and facts are straight. Facts are lazy and facts are late.\\"—is influenced by old school rap, specifically Kurtis Blow's \\"The Breaks\\" given to Byrne by Frantz. \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" borrows heavily from preachers' diatribes.Bowman, p. 172 Some critics have suggested that the song is \\"a kind of prescient jab at the excesses of the 1980s\\". Byrne disagreed with the categorisation and commented that its lyrics are meant to be taken literally; he stated, \\"We're largely unconscious. You know, we operate half awake or on autopilot and end up, whatever, with a house and family and job and everything else, and we haven't really stopped to ask ourselves, 'How did I get here?'.\\" Byrne has described the album's final mix as a \\"spiritual\\" piece of work, \\"joyous and ecstatic and yet it's serious\\"; he has pointed out that, in the end, there was \\"less Africanism in Remain in Light than we implied ... but the African ideas were far more important to get across than specific rhythms\\".Pareles, p. 39 According to Eno, the record uniquely blends funk and punk rock or new wave music. None of the compositions include chord changes and instead rely on the use of different harmonics and notes. \\"Spidery riffs\\" and layered tracks of bass and percussion are used extensively throughout the album. The first side contains the more rhythmic songs, \\"Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)\\", \\"Crosseyed and Painless\\", and \\"The Great Curve\\", which include long instrumental interludes. \\"The Great Curve\\" contains extended synthesiser-treated guitar solos from Belew. The second side features more introspective songs. \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" pays homage to early rap techniques and the music of art rock band The Velvet Underground. The track was originally called \\"Weird Guitar Riff Song\\" because of its composition. It was conceived as a single riff before the band added a second, boosted riff over the top of the first. Eno alternated eight bars of each riff with corresponding bars of its counterpart. \\"Houses in Motion\\" incorporates lengthy brass performances from Jon Hassell, while \\"Listening Wind\\" features Arabic music elements. The final track on the album, \\"The Overload,\\" was Talking Heads' attempt to emulate the sound of British post-punk band Joy Division. The song was made despite no band member having heard the music of Joy Division; rather, it was based on an idea of what the British quartet might sound like based on descriptions in the music press. The track features \\"tribal-cum-industrial\\" beats created primarily by Harrison and Byrne. Packaging and title Grumman Avengers, used by the US Navy, in which Weymouth's father had served, inspired the initial cover art, later used on the back of the LP sleeve after the album name change. The cover art was conceived by Weymouth and Frantz with the help of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Walter Bender and his ArcMac team (the precursor to the MIT Media Lab). Using Melody Attack as inspiration, the couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in formation over the Himalayas. The planes are an artistic depiction of Grumman Avenger planes in honour of Weymouth's father, Ralph Weymouth, who was a US Navy Admiral. The idea for the back cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender's colleague, Scott Fisher, on the computer renditions of the ideas. The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the mainframe alone took up several rooms.Bowman, p. 176 Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces (except for eyes, noses and mouths) were blotted out with blocks of red colour. Weymouth considered superimposing Eno's face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism—the producer wanted to be on the cover art together with Talking Heads—but decided against it in the end.Bowman, p. 177 The rest of the artwork and the liner notes were crafted by the graphic designer Tibor Kalman and his company M&Co.; Kalman was a fervent critic of formalism and professional design in art and advertisements.Bowman, p. 174 He offered his services for free to create publicity, and discussed using unconventional materials such as sandpaper and velour for the LP sleeve. Weymouth, who was skeptical of hiring a designing firm, vetoed Kalman's ideas and held firm on the MIT computerised images. The designing process made the band members realise that the title Melody Attack was \\"too flippant\\" for the music recorded, and they adopted Remain in Light instead. Byrne has noted, \\"Besides not being all that melodic, the music had something to say that at the time seemed new, transcendent, and maybe even revolutionary, at least for funk rock songs.\\" The image of the warplanes was relegated to the back of the sleeve and the doctored portraits became the front cover. Kalman later suggested that the planes were not removed altogether because they seemed appropriate during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979–81. Weymouth advised Kalman that she wanted simple typography in a bold sans serif font. M&Co.; followed the instructions and came up with the idea of inverting the \\"A\\"s in \\"TALKING HEADS\\". Weymouth and Frantz decided to use the joint credit acronym C/T for the artwork, while Bender and Fisher used initials and code names because the project was not an official MIT venture.Bowman, p. 178 The design credits read \\"HCL, JPT, DDD, WALTER GP, PAUL, C/T\\". The final mass-produced version of Remain in Light boasted one of the first computer-designed record jackets. Psychoanalyst Michael A. Brog has called its front cover a \\"disarming image, which suggests both splitting and obliteration of identity\\" and which introduces the listener to the album's recurring theme of \\"identity disturbance\\"; he states, \\"The image is in bleak contrast to the title with the obscured images of the band members unable to 'remain in light'.\\"Brog, p. 167 Talking Heads and Eno originally agreed to credit all songs in alphabetical order to \\"David Byrne, Brian Eno, Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison and Tina Weymouth\\" after failing to devise an accurate formula for the split, but the album was released with the label credit: \\"all songs written by David Byrne & Brian Eno (except \\"Houses In Motion\\" and 'The Overload\\", written by David Byrne, Brian Eno & Jerry Harrison)\\". Frantz, Harrison, and Weymouth disputed the credits, especially for a process they had partly funded. According to Weymouth, Byrne told Kalman to doctor the credits on Eno's advice.Bowman, p. 183 Later editions credit all band members. Frantz said \\"we felt very burnt by the credits dispute\\". Promotion and release Talking Heads hired five additional musicians for the Remain in Light promotional tours. Brian Eno advised Talking Heads that the music on Remain in Light was too dense for a quartet to perform. The band expanded to nine musicians for the tours in support of the album. The augmenting members recruited by Harrison were Belew, Funkadelic keyboardist Bernie Worrell, bassist Busta \\"Cherry\\" Jones, Ashford & Simpson percussionist Steven Scales, and backing vocalist Dolette MacDonald. The larger group performed soundchecks in Frantz and Weymouth's loft by following the rhythms established by Worrell, who had studied at the New England Conservatory and Juilliard School.Bowman, p. 180 The expanded band's first appearance was on August 23, 1980 at the Heatwave festival in Canada in front of 70,000 people; Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times called the band's new music a \\"rock-funk sound with dramatic, near show-stopping force\\". On August 27, the expanded Talking Heads performed a showcase of tracks to an 8000-person full house audience at the Wollman Rink as well as approximately another 10,000 seated on the grass outside the walls in New York City's Central Park.Bowman, p. 181 The Canada and New York gigs were the only ones initially planned, but Sire Records decided to support the nine-member band on an extended tour. Following the promotional tour, the band went on hiatus for several years, leaving the individual members to pursue a variety of side projects. Remain in Light was released worldwide on October 8, 1980. Remain in Light received its world premiere airing in its entirety on October 10, 1980 on WDFM. According to writer David Sheppard, \\"it was received as a great cultural event as much as a vivid art-pop record.\\" It was certified Gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association in February 1981 after shipping 50,000 copies, Note: User search required. and by Recording Industry Association of America in September 1985 after shipping 500,000 copies. Note: User search required. Over one million copies have been sold worldwide. Critical reception The album attained widespread acclaim from media outlets. Ken Tucker of Rolling Stone felt it was a brave and absorbing attempt to locate a common ground in the early 1980s divergent and often hostile musical genres; he concluded, \\"Remain in Light yields scary, funny music to which you can dance and think, think and dance, dance and think, ad infinitum.\\" Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, described the record as one \\"in which David Byrne conquers his fear of music in a visionary Afrofunk synthesis—clear-eyed, detached, almost mystically optimistic\\". Michael Kulp of the Daily Collegian commented that the album deserves the tag \\"classic\\" like each of the band's three previous full- length releases, while John Rockwell, writing in The New York Times, suggested that it confirmed Talking Heads' position as \\"America's most venturesome rock band\\". Sandy Robertson of Sounds praised the record's innovation, while Billboard wrote, \\"Just about every LP Talking Heads has released in the last four years has wound up on virtually every critics' best of list. Remain in Light should be no exception.\\" AllMusic's William Ruhlmann wrote that Talking Heads' musical transition, first witnessed in Fear of Music, came to full fruition in Remain in Light; he stated, \\"Talking Heads were connecting with an audience ready to follow their musical evolution, and the album was so inventive and influential.\\" In the 1995 Spin Alternative Record Guide, Eric Weisbard praised Eno's production effort which helped rein in any excessive appropriations of African music by Talking Heads. In 2004, Slant Magazines Barry Walsh labelled its results as \\"simply magical\\" after the band turned rock music into a more global entity in terms of its musical and lyrical scope. In a 2008 review, Sean Fennessey of Vibe concluded, \\"Talking Heads took African polyrhythms to NYC and made a return trip with elegant, alien post- punk in tow.\\" Accolades and legacy Remain in Light was named the best album of 1980 by Sounds, ahead of The Skids' The Absolute Game, and by Melody Maker, while The New York Times included it in its unnumbered shortlist of the 10 best records issued that year. It figured highly in other end-of-year best album lists, notably at number two, behind The Clash's London Calling, by Robert Christgau, and at number six by NME. It featured at number three—behind London Calling and Bruce Springsteen's The River—in The Village Voices 1980 Pazz & Jop critics' poll, which aggregates the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers. In 1989, Rolling Stone named Remain in Light as the fourth best album of the decade. In 1993, it was included at number 11 in NMEs list of The 50 Greatest Albums Of The '80s, and at number 68 in the publication's Greatest Albums Of All Time list. In 1997, The Guardian collated worldwide data from renowned critics, artists, and radio DJs, which placed the record at number 43 in the list of the 100 Best Albums Ever. In 1999, it was included by Vibe as one of its 100 Essential Albums Of The 20th Century. In 2000 it was voted number 227 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2002, Pitchfork Media featured Remain in Light at number two behind Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation in its Top 100 Albums Of The 1980s list. In 2003, VH1 named the record at number 88 during its 100 Greatest Albums countdown, while Slant magazine included it in its unnumbered shortlist of 50 Essential Pop Albums. Rolling Stone placed it at number 129 in its December 2015 issue of \\"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\", higher than three other Talking Heads releases. In 2006, Q ranked Remain in Light at number 27 in its list of the 40 Best Albums of the 80s. In 2012, Slant listed the album at number six on its list of the \\"Best Albums of the 1980s\\". In 2018, Beninese singer Angelique Kidjo released a song-for-song cover of Remain in Light (produced by Jeff Bhasker and released on his Kravenworks label), describing herself as a longtime fan of the song \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" and wanting to pay tribute to the album by emphasizing its inspiration from African music.

Headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, PRI provides programming to over 850 public radio stations in the United States. PRI is one of the main providers of programming for public radio stations in the US, alongside National Public Radio, American Public Media and the Public Radio Exchange. Background In the United States, PRI distributes well-known programming to public radio stations. Among its programs is the global news program The World, which PRI co-produces with WGBH Boston. Programs on PRI—sometimes mis-attributed to National Public Radio—are produced by a variety of organizations, including PRI in the United States and other countries. PRI, along with NPR and American Public Media, is one of the largest program producers and distributors of public radio programming in the United States. PRI offers over 280 hours of programming each week to stations and listeners. According to their website, the mission of Public Radio International is to \\"serve audiences as a distinctive content source for information, insights and cultural experiences essential to living in our diverse, interconnected world.\\" Approximately 850 radio station affiliates and other audio venues broadcast, stream and download PRI programs. According to the 2017 Nielsen AudioNielsen Audio Nationwide-Act 1 Systems, DMA Persons 12+ based on stations' broadcast schedule ratings, 8.1 million people listened to PRI programming each week. PRI's programs have won awards for quality and innovation, including the DuPont-Columbia Award, Scripps Howard Award for Excellence in Electronic Media/Radio, George M. Foster Peabody Award,Peabody Awards for Public Radio International, accessed September 2014. Golden Reel Award and Gabriel Award. PRI programming receives funding from station fees, corporate underwriting, and individual and corporate grants. Less than 2% of the overall operating budget comes from United States government agencies. History PRI was founded in 1983 as American Public Radio as an alternative to NPR for public radio program distribution. Five stations established American Public Radio as a syndicate: the Minnesota Public Radio network, KQED/San Francisco, WGUC/Cincinnati, and KUSC in Los Angeles. The corporation changed its name to Public Radio International in 1994 to reflect its growing interest and involvement in international audio publishing, as typified by its many collaborations with the BBC. In the mid-1990s, PRI began to expand its reach by producing programming in addition to distributing programming. This evolution in the company began with PRI's The World, originally a co-production among PRI, the BBC World Service, and WGBH. In 2004, Minnesota Public Radio left PRI and began distributing its own shows (including A Prairie Home Companion and Marketplace and excluding Classical 24) through American Public Media. In 2012, PRI was acquired by the WGBH Educational Foundation. On August 15, 2018, Public Radio International and Public Radio Exchange announced they would merge, though both networks would maintain separate identities and programming. Recent program launches and firsts In 1995: PRI launches Classical 24, public radio’s first 24-hour classical music service, as a co- production with Minnesota Public Radio. In 1996: PRI’s The World premieres, presenting issues and events \\"through a global lens\\" to American audiences. Co-produced by PRI with BBC World Service and WGBH Radio Boston, it was the first daily news co-production ever undertaken by the BBC. In 2001: PRI’s Studio 360 launches. In September, PRI and Symphony Space of New York City announced that PRI would become the national distribution partner of Selected Shorts, which had previously been distributed by National Public Radio. In January 2008, PRI and WNYC announced that the name of their new morning drive news program is The Takeaway with John Hockenberry and Adaora Udoji. This program's editorial partners include The BBC World Service, The New York Times, and WGBH Radio Boston. The program successfully launched April 28, and full national launch was expected June/July 2008. On May 1, 2008, PRI was the first major public media outlet to use digital cinema; and one of the first mass media companies overall. PRI conceived and spearheaded This American Life Live! in partnership with Ira Glass and WBEZ Chicago. This American Life Live! was presented exclusively in select theatres by National CineMedia's (NCM) Fathom, in partnership with BY Experience and Chicago Public Radio, and in association with Public Radio International. In 2012: PRI is acquired by WGBH. On March 21, 2014, the company announced the agreement to distribute This American Life would end July 1, 2014. In 2017: PRI launches its Engagement Lab.  Relationship with NPR  Public radio is a generic term for non- commercial radio stations or programming that are covered under the Public Broadcasting Act. Public radio organizations receive funding from corporate sponsors, public (e.g., Corporation for Public Broadcasting) and private foundation grants as well as donations and gifts from individuals. The mix of revenue differs by station, network and/or producer. PRI, NPR and American Public Media are the largest providers of public radio programming in the United States. They compete with each other for slots on public radio stations and the attention of listeners. Each has distinct missions and emphases in programming—PRI is focused on global journalism, providing diverse voices, and arts and cultural perspectives. Any given public radio station may be simultaneously both an NPR member and an affiliate of PRI and APM. PRI is a not-for-profit organization that has an independent governing board with an independent board of directors. NPR is a membership organization; its board is composed of public radio stations which run for seats on the board. PRI is a younger organization than NPR, and focuses on pushing the sound of public radio forward through innovative programming strategies and leading media in its areas of focus—global news and cultural perspectives. (NPR was founded in 1970 and PRI in 1983.) Many PRI shows draw a younger overall audience than shows produced by NPR. PRI's stated purpose is to offer a wider range of voices than NPR programs. In recent years, there have been changes among distributors of numerous programs. Some programs that were formerly distributed by PRI, such as A Prairie Home Companion, Marketplace, and American Routes, along with the BBC World Service, are now distributed by American Public Media. APM was formed by Minnesota Public Radio to distribute programs it owned and produced, thereby moving distribution from PRI to APM. In addition, PRI distributed World Cafe for many years, but in 2005, the show's distribution was switched to NPR. At the same time, PRI has also picked up the distribution of programs originally distributed by NPR, including Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya Know?, and, in 2006, Living on Earth—public radio's leading news and information program focused on the environment. In September 2007, PRI became the national distributor of Selected Shorts which was previously distributed by NPR. In January 2014, PRI became the national distributor of Science Friday, also previously distributed by NPR. On April 11, 2018, distribution of the show changed hands once more when it went from PRI to WNYC Studios.'Science Friday' partners with WNYC on distribution Current Public Media, January 11, 2018.

History  Background  After the fall of Constantinople to the crusaders in 1204, Boniface of Montferrat, the leader of the crusade, was expected by both the Crusaders and the defeated Byzantines to become the new emperor. However, the Venetians felt that Boniface was too closely tied to the Byzantine Empire, as his brother Conrad had married into the Byzantine imperial family. The Venetians wanted an emperor whom they could control more easily, and with their influence, Baldwin of Flanders was elected as emperor of the new Latin Empire.  Establishment  Boniface reluctantly accepted this, and set out to conquer Thessalonica, the second-largest Byzantine city after Constantinople. At first he had to compete with Emperor Baldwin, who also wanted the city. He then went on to capture the city later in 1204 and set up a kingdom there, subordinate to Baldwin, although the title of \\"king\\" was never officially used. Late 13th and 14th century sources suggest that Boniface based his claim to Thessalonica on the statement that his younger brother Renier had been granted Thessalonica on his marriage to Maria Komnene in 1180.E.g. Salimbene de Adam, Chronicle, 1966 edition vol. 2 p. 790. Cf. , and for full discussion . In 1204–05, Boniface was able to extend his rule south into Greece, advancing through Thessaly, Boeotia, Euboea, and Attica. The boundaries of the actual Kingdom of Thessalonica seem to have extended only up to Domokos, Pharsalus, and Velestino: southern Thessaly, with the towns of Zetounion and Ravennika, was under governors appointed by the Latin Emperor, and the principalities of southern Greece were only Boniface's feudal vassals. Emperor Henry of Flanders' expedition against the rebellious Lombard barons of Thessalonica in 1208–09, however, ended the feudal dependency of the southern principalities—the Duchy of Athens, the Marquisate of Bodonitsa, the Lordship of Salona, and the Triarchy of Negroponte—on Thessalonica, replacing it with direct imperial suzerainty.  The Lombard Rebellion  Boniface's rule lasted less than two years before he was ambushed by Tsar Kaloyan of Bulgaria and killed on September 4, 1207. The kingdom passed to Boniface's son Demetrius, who was still a baby, so actual power was held by various minor nobles of Lombard origin. These nobles, under the regent Oberto, began plotting to place William VI of Montferrat, Boniface's elder son, on the throne, and openly defied the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders. Henry marched against them in 1209 and forced their submission. As a result, Henry's brother Eustace then became regent for Demetrius.  War with Epirus and fall  Taking advantage of this situation, Michael I of Epirus, a former ally of Boniface, attacked the kingdom in 1210, as did the Bulgarians. Henry of Flanders eventually defeated both, but after Michael's death in 1214, his brother and successor Theodore began anew the assault on the kingdom. Over the next nine years Theodore gradually conquered all of Thessalonica except the city itself, as the Latin Empire could spare no army to defend it while they were busy fighting the Byzantine Empire of Nicaea in Asia. In 1224, just as Demetrius had become old enough to take power for himself, Theodore finally captured Thessalonica and the kingdom became part of the Despotate of Epirus.  Titular claimants  The kingdom was claimed by titular kings of the house of Montferrat until 1284 and also by the dukes of Burgundy; Baldwin II of Constantinople had promised the title to Hugh IV should he regain the Latin Empire.

Life MacDonald (sometimes spelt MacDonell) was the second son of Ranald MacDonald, Chief of Clanranald. When still young he was sent to France where he received a commission in the Royal-Ecossais Regiment of the French army. In 1745 he was sent by King Louis XV to assist Charles Edward Stuart in the Jacobite rising. MacDonald was wounded at the siege of Stirling Castle and imprisoned after the surrender of the Jacobite forces. As a French officer he was released from imprisonment and returned to France. MacDonald took advantage of the amnesty which was granted by Britain to Jacobite officers, and on 12 January 1757 was gazetted a captain in the regiment raised by Simon Fraser, the 78th Fraser Highlanders. In 1758 MacDonald sailed to Louisbourg which was then under siege as part of the Seven Years' War. He was wounded there on the night of 21 July. MacDonald participated in the subsequent siege of Quebec. On the night of 13 September 1759 he was part of the forlorn hope, the twenty-four volunteers leading the British attempt to climb the cliffs rising above the St. Lawrence River. It was MacDonald who responded in French to the challenge of the French guards, buying time for enough men to gather and overpower the post. This in turn allowed almost 5,000 British troops to climb the cliffs and mass on the Plains of Abraham. During the subsequent winter, MacDonald was given several independent commands, constantly harassing the French outposts surrounding Quebec. At the Battle of Sainte-Foy, 28 April 1760, MacDonald commanded a company of volunteers on the left flank of the British army and was killed in the action. There is significant evidence that MacDonald was a harsh officer disliked by his own men as well as by his opponents. He received the nickname \\"Donald Goran\\" (Donald the Sinister). There is some indication that his wounding at Louisbourg may have been at the hands of his own men. When he was killed at Sillery, his body was hacked to pieces.

Unlike many other IRC clients, nearly all of the functionality in ViRC is driven by the included IRC script, with the result that the program's behavior can be extended or changed without altering the source code. History *Visual IRC (16-bit) - Released in 1995 for Windows 3.x, written by MeGALiTH. This program had many built-in features, but it was also scriptable with VPL (ViRC Programming Language), the predecessor to ViRCScript and Versus. *Visual IRC '96 (and later Visual IRC '97, Visual IRC '98) - Released in 1996, written by MeGALiTH. This was the first 32-bit version of ViRC, written for Windows 9x/NT. Many of the features that were built into 16-bit ViRC were handled by the default script in ViRC '96. ViRC '98 contained some code contributed by Jesse McGrew AKA \\"Mr2001\\", particularly enhancements to the ViRCScript engine. The scripting language was incompatible with the earlier version. In later versions, voice chat and video conferencing features were added. :Development of the second incarnation slowed and by 2000 Visual IRC appeared to be dead. The original author MeGALiTH (Adrian Cable) passed the source code to a user, Mr2001 (Jesse McGrew), who had previously contributed some code, and who had secretly been developing a clone called Bisual IRC (BIRC). Rather than restarting development of the ViRC '98 code base, he merged some of ViRC '98's features into BIRC and released it as Visual IRC 2. *Visual IRC 2 - First released by Mr2001, coincidentally in 2001, this version's Versus scripting language is based on ViRCScript, but internally it has been almost totally rewritten. In fact, ViRC 2 only shares a few hundred lines of code with ViRC '98. The voice and video conferencing features were removed in this version because the libraries used to implement them were no longer supported. Much of the source code to BIRC, ViRC 2, and the related utilities has been released under the GPL through the project's web site and SourceForge. Versus Versus is a scripting language originally developed for the IRC client Bisual IRC, and currently used with Visual IRC. It is similar in many ways to the scripting languages used by ircII and mIRC, as well as Tcl and C. The name \\"Versus\\" was chosen because it could be shortened to \\"VS\\", which was a common abbreviation for ViRCScript, the language used by Visual IRC '96 through '98. Versus remained mostly backward compatible with ViRCScript, so existing documentation and commentary that mentioned \\"VS\\" remained mostly accurate when applied to Versus. The name also alluded to BIRC's origins as a replacement for ViRC. Object Versus, or OVS, refers to the object-oriented features of Versus. Scripts can define classes and work with objects and methods instead of textual data and aliases; however, in practice, OVS is mostly used to manipulate the VCL objects that make up ViRC's interface. Script storage Scripts are stored in files, usually with a .vsc file extension, though the .lib extension is sometimes used. A Versus script file simply contains statements to be interpreted when the script is loaded; any blocks defined in a script (see below) will replace blocks defined with the same name by previous scripts. Blocks that can be defined in a script *Aliases are subroutines. They can be called from the command entry line of any window, or from other parts of the script. Aliases that return a value are called functions; an alias can determine whether it's expected to return a value, and then act as a function or a command appropriately. *Classes are used in object-oriented scripting (OVS). Each class may contain properties, methods, a constructor, and a destructor. *Events are used to handle messages from the IRC server, as well as certain system- or client-level occurrences, such as completing a file transfer or opening a new window. **Server events use regular expressions or Versus's own wildcard characters to match messages from the server. If multiple server events match a particular message, only the one with the highest priority (calculated from the length of the pattern and the relative \\"value\\" of the wildcards therein) will be executed. **Client events are identified by name: for example, <OnCreateWindow_foo> and <OnCreateWindow_bar> will both run when a new window is opened. They can also include patterns, which limit the particular occurrences that can trigger that event (for example, to only run when a new channel window is created). *Menu trees and menu items define the context menus that can appear for various elements of the client's interface, as well as the main menu which is always visible. Menu tree blocks define the menu's layout and set captions for each item; menu item blocks define the script code to be executed when an item is clicked. *Toolbars and toolbar items are similar to menu tree and menu item blocks, but they define the toolbars associated with each window. New toolbars can be added to the interface simply by choosing a unique name. Aliases, methods (including constructors and destructors), events, menu items, and toolbar items are referred to as routines or code blocks.  Data storage  Files *Scripts can access files with the functions $RandomRead() and $ReadLine(), and the commands CreateFile and AppendText. *Scripts can also use the TStringList VCL class to read an entire text file into memory, manipulate it, and save it. Variables *All variables may contain up to 4 GiB of data. *Variable names begin with a dollar sign ($) and an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or underscore. *Variables may contain any characters, although they are usually used for printable text. *Local variables are set with the \`@L\` command and only exist in the context of the routine that created them. They are deleted when the routine ends. Some local variables are predefined, such as $C for the current channel's name. *Global variables are set with the \`@\` command and can be accessed from any routine. They are deleted when the client exits. Aliases may return a value by setting the global variable $fresult. *Stored variables are set with the \`@S\` command and, like global variables, can be accessed anywhere. Their values are saved to persistent storage immediately, and restored the next time the client starts.

Early years Li Zicheng was born in 1606 as Li Hongji to an impoverished family of farmers in Li Jiqian village, Yan'an prefecture, northeast Shaanxi province. Li Zicheng had a brother who was 20 years his senior and raised Li Zicheng alongside his son and Zicheng’s nephew, Li Guo. While Li Zicheng was literate, the source of his education is disputed. Over the course of his late adolescence and early adulthood, Li worked on a farm, in a wine shop, in a blacksmith's shop, and as a mailman for the state courier system. According to folklore, in 1630, Li was put on public display in an iron collar and shackles for failing to repay loans to a usurious magistrate. The magistrate, a man by the name of Ai, struck a guard who tried to give Li shade and water. A group of sympathetic peasants freed Li from his shackles, spirited him to a nearby hill, and proclaimed him their leader. Although they were only armed with wooden sticks, Li and his band managed to ambush a group of government soldiers sent to arrest them, and obtained their first real weapons. Rise of Li Zicheng and the peasant rebellions By the late Ming Dynasty era, the government had been weakened financially, and struggled to deal with the economic issues, environmental problems, and widespread disease (smallpox and possibly the plague) that afflicted peasant populations. In 1639, an epidemic that would later become known as the Chongzhen Slough hit the Yangzi region and spread across the north. Famine and drought compounded the social discontent caused by the epidemic. Environmental disaster, disease, and the failure of the Chongzhen government to protect its people led to major peasant uprisings across Northern China beginning in 1628, with the Shaanxi province as an epicenter of rebellion. Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, also from Shaanxi province, were two of the major leaders in the peasant rebellions under the late Ming dynasty. In 1633, Li joined a rebel army led by Gao Yingxiang, nicknamed \\"Dashing King.” He inherited Gao's nickname and command of the rebel army after Gao's death. Within three years, Li succeeded in rallying more than 30,000 men to form a rebel army. They attacked and killed prominent government officials such as Sun Chuanting in the Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces. As Li won more battles and gained more support, his army grew larger. Historians attribute this growth in numbers to Li’s reputation as a Robin Hood style figure who showed compassion to the poor and only attacked Ming officials. Some battles Li fought in this period * Battle of Chexiang Pass * Battle of Fengyang Battles of Luoyang, Nanyang and Kaifeng Li advocated the slogan of \\"dividing land equally and abolishing the grain taxes payment system\\" which won great support from the peasants. The song of \\"killing cattle and sheep, preparing tasty wine and opening the city gate to welcome the Dashing King\\" was widely spread at that time. The 1642 Kaifeng flood (during the 3rd Battle of Kaifeng), caused by breaches of the Yellow River dikes by both sides,Lorge, Peter Allan War, Politics and Society in Early Modern China, 900–1795 Routledge; (2005) p.147 ended the siege of Kaifeng and killed over 300,000 of its 378,000 residents.Xu, Xin The Jews of Kaifeng, China: history, culture, and religion Ktav Pub Inc (2003) p. 47 After the battles of Luoyang and Kaifeng, the Ming government was unable to stop Li's rebellion, as most of its military force was involved in the battle against the Manchus in the north. Li declared himself the King of the Shun dynasty in Xi'an, Shaanxi. From the Battle of Xiangyang to the creation of the Shun dynasty In 1642, Li captured Xiangyang and proclaimed himself \\"King Xinshun\\". The situation as of November 1644 Battle of Beijing and establishment of the Shun Dynasty Li Zicheng led one of the major peasant uprisings that the weakened Ming administration struggled to combat. When Li took over the Ming capital it marked the end of the Ming dynasty. In April 1644, Li's rebels sacked the Ming capital of Beijing, and the Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide. Li proclaimed himself the Emperor of the Shun dynasty.  Claim to the Mandate of Heaven  Li, as all contenders for the throne were required, claimed to have the Mandate of Heaven bestowed upon him. Firstly, Li hailed from the Shaanxi province of China, which strengthened his legitimacy to the throne versus the foreign Manchus. Li also gained the support of scholar officials which was important in leading over the people of China as a Confucian state. The name of the dynasty is translated to mean \\"Obedient to Heaven\\".  Battle of Shanhai Pass and end of Shun Dynasty  Li's army was defeated on 27 May 1644 at the Battle of Shanhai Pass by the combined forces of the defecting Ming general Wu Sangui and Prince Dorgon leading the Manchus. The Ming and Manchu forces captured Beijing on June 6 and Fulin ascended to the throne to establish the Shunzhi reign with the Dorgon prince as regent. Death When Wu Sangui and the Dorgon Prince took control of Beijing, Li fled to Xi'an in Shaanxi. It is not exactly known how Li died and there are multiple accounts of his death which vary and some are exaggerated by folklore. Across multiple sources, the year of his death is said to be in 1645. One account states that in the summer of 1645 Li went to raid a village in search of sustenance with his remaining followers and was killed by soldiers guarding the village. Another theory was that Li Zicheng became a monk and died in 1674.  Historiography  Temporary Palace of Li Zicheng in Mizhi County, ShaanxiAlthough the success of the Ming-Qing transition was attributed to the weakening of the Ming dynasty (exacerbated by Li Zicheng's rebellion), official historiography during the Qing dynasty regarded Li as an illegitimate usurper and outlaw. This view sought to discourage and demonize notions of rebellion against the Qing government, by propagating that the Manchus put an end to Li's illegitimate rule and restore peace to the empire, thus receiving the Mandate of Heaven to rule China. Physical Appearance In the History of Ming, Li Zicheng was described as having high cheekbones, deep-set eyes and a jackal-like voice. In popular culture Li appears as a bandit in Baifa Monü Zhuan, a wuxia novel by Liang Yusheng, where the heroine comments he is worthy of being a king. Li is featured as a character in some of the works of Hong Kong wuxia writer Jin Yong (Louis Cha). Li's rebellion against the Ming dynasty is featured in Sword Stained with Royal Blood and his personality is analysed from the point of view of Yuan Chengzhi, the protagonist. In The Deer and the Cauldron, set in the Qing dynasty during the early reign of the Kangxi Emperor, Li is revealed to have survived and fathered a daughter, A'ke, with Chen Yuanyuan. Li is also briefly mentioned by name in Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain and The Young Flying Fox. Li is the main character of the historical epic novel Li Zicheng by Yao Xueyin.  In folklore  There are many stories and folklore attributed to Li Zicheng. One such story claims that when Li Zicheng was young he killed one of his classmates and was promptly disowned by his family and shunned by his community.

(2014). Institutional Time. The Monacelli Press. and writer known for her large collaborative art installation pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. During the 1970s, Chicago founded the first feminist art program in the United States at California State University Fresno (formerly Fresno State College) and acted as a catalyst for Feminist art and art education. Her inclusion in hundreds of publications in various areas of the world showcases her influence in the art community. Additionally, many of her books have been published in other countries, making her work more accessible to international readers. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is The Dinner Party, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. The Dinner Party celebrates the accomplishments of women throughout history and is widely regarded as the first epic feminist artwork. Other notable art projects by Chicago include International Honor Quilt, The Birth Project, Powerplay, and The Holocaust Project. Chicago was included in Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018. Early personal life Judy Chicago was born Judith Sylvia CohenLevin in Bloch and Umansky, 305 in 1939, to Arthur and May Cohen, in Chicago, Illinois. Her father came from a twenty-three generation lineage of rabbis, including the Lithuanian Jewish Vilna Gaon. Unlike his family predecessors, Arthur became a labor organizer and a Marxist. He worked nights at a post office and took care of Chicago during the day, while May, who was a former dancer, worked as a medical secretary. Arthur's active participation in the American Communist Party, liberal views towards women and support of workers' rights strongly influenced Chicago's ways of thinking and belief.Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 306 During the McCarthyism era in the 1950s, Arthur was investigated, which made it difficult for him to find work and caused the family much turmoil. In 1945, while Chicago was alone at home with her infant brother, Ben, an FBI agent visited their house. The agent began to ask the six-year-old Chicago questions about her father and his friends, but the agent was interrupted upon the return of May to the house. Arthur's health declined and he died in 1953 from peritonitis. May would not discuss his death with her children and did not allow them to attend the funeral. Chicago did not come to terms with his death until she was an adult; in the early 1960s she was hospitalized for almost a month with a bleeding ulcer attributed to unresolved grief.Felder and Rosen, 279. May loved the arts, and instilled her passion for them in her children, as evident in Chicago's future as an artist, and brother Ben's eventual career as a potter. At age of three, Chicago began to draw and was sent to the Art Institute of Chicago to attend classes.Wydler and Lippard, 5. By the age of 5, Chicago knew that she \\"never wanted to do anything but make art\\" and started attending classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. She applied but was denied admission to the Art Institute, and instead attended UCLA on a scholarship. Education and early career While at UCLA, she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA NAACP chapter and eventually became its corresponding secretary. In June 1959, she met and became romantically linked with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple hitch hiked to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her.Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 308 The couple lived in Greenwich Village for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961.Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 311 She graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1962 and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, which devastated and caused Chicago to suffer from an identity crisis until later that decade. She received her Master of Fine Arts from UCLA in 1964. While in grad school, Chicago's created a series that was abstract, yet easily recognized as male and female sexual organs. These early works were called Bigamy, and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract penis, which was \\"stopped in flight\\" before it could unite with a vaginal form. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works. Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes. In 1965, Chicago displayed work in her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles; Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show. In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the \\"California Women in the Arts\\" exhibition at the Lytton Center, to which she answered, \\"I won't show in any group defined as Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday when we all grow up there will be no labels.\\" Chicago began working in ice sculpture, which represented \\"a metaphor for the preciousness of life,\\" another reference towards her husband's death.Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 314 Study for Pasadena Lifesavers, prismacolor, 1968. In 1969, the Pasadena Art Museum exhibited a series of Chicago's spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an \\"experimental\\" gallery. Art in America noted that Chicago's work was at the forefront of the conceptual art movement, and the Los Angeles Times described the work as showing no signs of \\"theoretical New York type art.\\" Chicago would describe her early artwork as minimalist and as her trying to be \\"one of the boys.\\"Lewis and Lewis, 455. Chicago would also experiment with performance art, using fireworks and pyrotechnics to create \\"atmospheres,\\" which involved flashes of colored smoke being manipulated outdoors. Through this work she attempted to \\"feminize\\" and \\"soften\\" the landscape.Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 315 During this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the Pasadena Lifesavers, which was a series of abstract paintings that placed acrylic paint on Plexiglas. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes \\"turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle,\\" representing her own discovery that \\"I was multi-orgasmic.\\" Chicago credited Pasadena Lifesavers, as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women's sexuality and representation. From Cohen to Gerowitz to Chicago: Name change As Chicago made a name for herself as an artist and came to know herself as a woman, she no longer felt connected to her last name, Cohen. This was due to the late grief of the death of her father and the lost connection to her name through marriage, Judith Gerowitz, after her husband's death. She decided to change her last name to something independent of being connected to a man by marriage or heritage. In 1965, she married sculptor Lloyd Hamrol. (They divorced in 1979.)Felder and Rosen, 280. Gallery owner Rolf Nelson nicknamed her \\"Judy Chicago\\" because of her strong personality and thick Chicago accent. She decided this would be her new name. In legally changing her surname from the ethnically charged Gerowitz to the ethnically neutral Chicago, she freed herself from a certain social identity. Chicago was appalled that her new husband's signature was required to change her name legally. To celebrate the name change, she posed for the exhibition invitation dressed like a boxer, wearing a sweatshirt with her new last name on it. She also posted a banner across the gallery at her 1970 solo show at California State University at Fullerton, that read: \\"Judy Gerowitz hereby divests herself of all names imposed upon her through male social dominance and chooses her own name, Judy Chicago.\\" An advertisement with the same statement was also placed in Artforum's October 1970 issue.Levin, Becoming Judy Chicago; A Biography of the Artist, p. 139 Artistic career The feminist art movement and the 1970s In 1970, Chicago decided to teach full-time at Fresno State College, hoping to teach women the skills needed to express the female perspective in their work.Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 317 At Fresno, she planned a class that would consist only of women, and she decided to teach off campus to escape \\"the presence and hence, the expectations of men.\\"Levin in Bloch and Umansky, 318 She taught the first women's art class in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College. It became the Feminist Art Program, a full 15-unit program, in the spring of 1971. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, Vanalyne Green, Suzanne Lacy, Cay Lang, Karen LeCocq, Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, Faith Wilding, Shawnee Wollenman, Nancy Youdelman, and Cheryl Zurilgen. Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown Fresno. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art. All of the students and Chicago contributed $25 per month to rent the space and to pay for materials. Later, Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro reestablished the Feminist Art Program at California Institute of the Arts. After Chicago left for Cal Arts, the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by Joyce Aiken in 1973, until her retirement in 1992. Chicago is considered one of the \\"first-generation feminist artists,\\" a group that also includes Mary Beth Edelson, Carolee Schneeman, and Rachel Rosenthal. They were part of the Feminist art movement in Europe and the United States in the early 1970s to develop feminist writing and art. via Questia (subscription required) Chicago became a teacher at the California Institute for the Arts, and was a leader for their Feminist Art Program. In 1972, the program created Womanhouse, alongside Miriam Schapiro, which was the first art exhibition space to display a female point of view in art. With Arlene Raven and Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Chicago co-founded the Los Angeles Woman's Building in 1973. This art school and exhibition space was in a structure named after a pavilion at the 1893 World's Colombian Exhibition that featured art made by women from around the world. This housed the Feminist Studio Workshop, described by the founders as \\"an experimental program in female education in the arts. Our purpose is to develop a new concept of art, a new kind of artist and a new art community built from the lives, feelings, and needs of women.\\" During this period, Chicago began creating spray-painted canvas, primarily abstract, with geometric forms on them. These works evolved, using the same medium, to become more centered around the meaning of the \\"feminine.\\" Chicago was strongly influenced by Gerda Lerner, whose writings convinced her that women who continued to be unaware and ignorant of women's history would continue to struggle independently and collectively. Womanhouse Womanhouse was a project that involved Judy Chicago and Miriam Schapiro. It began in the fall of 1971 and was the first public exhibition of Feminist Art. They wanted to start the year with a large scale collaborative project that involved woman artists who spent much of their time talking about their problems as women. They used those problems as fuel and dealt with them while working on the project. Judy thought that female students often approach art- making with an unwillingness to push their limits due to their lack of familiarity with tools and processes, and an inability to see themselves as working people. In this environment, female artists experimented with women's conventional roles and experiences and how these could be displayed. \\"The aim of the Feminist Art Program is to help women restructure their personalities to be more consistent with their desires to be artists and to help them build their art-making out of their experiences as women.\\" Womanhouse is a \\"true\\" dramatic representation of woman's experience beginning in childhood, encompassing the struggles at home, with housework, menstruation, marriage, etc. In 1975, Chicago's first book, Through the Flower, was published; it \\"chronicled her struggles to find her own identity as a woman artist.\\" The Dinner Party thumb The Dinner Party as installed at the Brooklyn Museum. Chicago decided to take Lerner's lesson to heart and took action to teach women about their history. This action would become Chicago's masterpiece, The Dinner Party, now in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum. It took her five years and cost about $250,000 to complete. First, Chicago conceived the project in her Santa Monica studio: a large triangle, which measures 48-feet by 43-feet by 36-feet, consisting of 39 place settings. Each place setting commemorates a historical or mythical female figure, such as artists, goddesses, activists, and martyrs. Thirteen women are represented on each side, comparable with the number said to be at a traditional witches' coven and triple the amount of attendees at the Last Supper. The embroidered table runners are stitched in the style and technique of the woman's time. Numerous other names of women are engraved in the \\"Heritage Floor\\" upon which the piece sits. The project came into fruition with the assistance of over 400 people, mainly women, who volunteered to assist in needlework, creating sculptures and other aspects of the process.Felder and Rosen, 281. When The Dinner Party was first constructed, it was a traveling exhibition. Through the Flower, her non- profit organization, was originally created to cover the expense of the creation and travel of the artwork. Jane Gerhard dedicated a book to Judy Chicago and The Dinner Party, entitled \\"The Dinner Party: Judy Chicago and The Power of Popular Feminism, 1970–2007.\\" Inspiration for The Dinner Party came from a personal experience where Chicago found herself at a male dominated event. This event included highly educated men and women, however the men dominated the conversation and essence of the space. Chicago highlights important women that are often overlooked, giving credit to those who have stepped up for women's rights. This work is less of a statement and more of an honoring and a form of gratitude and inspiration. Chicago wanted the piece to teach about the struggle for power and equality women have endured in male- dominant societies. It considers the possibility of a meeting between powerful women and how this could change human history. Many art critics, including Hilton Kramer from The New York Times, were unimpressed by her work. Mr. Kramer felt Chicago's intended vision was not conveyed through this piece and \\"it looked like an outrageous libel on the female imagination.\\" Although art critics felt her work lacked depth and the dinner party was just \\"vaginas on plates,\\" it was popular and captivated the general public. Chicago debuted her work in six countries on three continents. She reached over a million people through her artwork. Her work might not have pleased critics but its feminist message captivated the public and it honored its featured 39 historical figures and 999 other women. Birth Project and PowerPlay From 1980 until 1985, Chicago created Birth Project. It took five years to create. The piece used images of childbirth to celebrate woman's role as mother. Chicago was inspired to create this collective work because of the lack of imagery and representation of birth in the art world. The installation reinterpreted the Genesis creation narrative, which focused on the idea that a male god created a male human, Adam, without the involvement of a woman. Chicago described the piece as revealing a \\"primordial female self hidden among the recesses of my soul...the birthing woman is part of the dawn of creation.\\" 150 needleworkers from the United States, Canada and New Zealand assisted in the project, working on 100 panels, by quilting, macrame, embroidery and other techniques. The size of the piece means it is rarely displayed in its entirety. The majority of the pieces from Birth Project are held in the collection of the Albuquerque Museum. Chicago was not personally interested in motherhood. While she admired the women who chose this path, she did not find it right for herself. As recently as 2012, she said, \\"There was no way on this earth I could have had children and the career I've had.\\" After Birth Project, Chicago returned to independent studio work. She created PowerPlay, a series of drawings, weavings, paintings, cast paper and bronze reliefs. Through the series, Chicago replaced the male gaze with a feminist one, exploring the construct of masculinity and how power has affected men. A new kind of collaboration and The Holocaust Project In the mid-1980s Chicago's interests \\"shifted beyond 'issues of female identity' to an exploration of masculine power and powerlessness in the context of the Holocaust.\\" Chicago's The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light (1985–93) is a collaboration with her husband, photographer Donald Woodman, whom she married on New Year's Eve 1985. Although Chicago's previous husbands were both Jewish, it wasn't until she met Woodman that she began to explore her own Jewish heritage. Chicago met poet Harvey Mudd, who had written an epic poem about the Holocaust. Chicago was interested in illustrating the poem, but decided to create her own work instead, using her own art, visual and written. Chicago worked alongside her husband to complete the piece, which took eight years to finish. The piece, which documents victims of the Holocaust, was created during a time of personal loss in Chicago's life: the death of her brother Ben from Lou Gehrig's disease, and the death of her mother from cancer.Felder and Rosen, 282. Chicago used the tragic event of the Holocaust as a prism through which to explore victimization, oppression, injustice, and human cruelty. To seek inspiration for the project, Chicago and Woodman watched the documentary Shoah, which comprises interviews with Holocaust survivors at Nazi concentration camps and other relevant Holocaust sites. They also explored photo archives and written pieces about the Holocaust. They spent several months touring concentration camps and visited Israel. Chicago brought other issues into the work, such as environmentalism, Native American genocide, and the Vietnam War. With these subjects Chicago sought to relate contemporary issues to the moral dilemma behind the Holocaust. This aspect of the work caused controversy within the Jewish community, due to the comparison of the Holocaust to these other historical and contemporary concerns. The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light consists of sixteen large scale works made of a variety of mediums including: tapestry, stained glass, metal work, wood work, photography, painting, and the sewing of Audrey Cowan. The exhibit ends with a piece that displays a Jewish couple at Sabbath. The piece comprises 3000 square feet, providing a full exhibition experience for the viewer. The Holocaust Project: From Darkness into Light was exhibited for the first time in October 1993 at the Spertus Museum in Chicago. Most of the work from the piece is held at the Holocaust Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Felder and Rosen, 284. Over the next six years, Chicago created works that explored the experiences of concentration camp victims. Galit Mana of Jewish Renaissance magazine notes, \\"This shift in focus led Chicago to work on other projects with an emphasis on Jewish tradition\\", including Voices from the Song of Songs (1997), where Chicago \\"introduces feminism and female sexuality into her representation of strong biblical female characters.\\" Current work and life In 1985, Chicago was remarried, to photographer Donald Woodman. To celebrate the couple's 25th wedding anniversary, Chicago created a \\"Renewal Ketubah\\" in 2010. In 1994, Judy Chicago started \\"Resolutions: A Stitch in Time\\" which took six years to complete. The public audience later got to see this project at the Museum of Art and Design in New York in 2000. In 1996, Chicago and Woodman moved into the historic Belen Hotel, an historic railroad hotel in Belen, New Mexico which Woodman had spent three years converting into a home. Chicago's archives are held at the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe College, and her collection of women's history and culture books are held in the collection of the University of New Mexico. In 1999, Chicago received the UCLA Alumni Professional Achievement Award, and has been awarded honorary degrees from Lehigh University, Smith College, Duke University and Russell Sage College. In 2004, Chicago received a Visionary Woman Award from Moore College of Art & Design. Chicago was named a National Women's History Project honoree for Women's History Month in 2008. Chicago donated her collection of feminist art educational materials to Penn State University in 2011. She lives in New Mexico. In the fall of 2011, Chicago returned to Los Angeles for the opening of the \\"Concurrents\\" exhibition at the Getty Museum. For the exhibition, she returned to the Pomona College football field, where in the late 1960s she had held a firework-based installation, and performed the piece again. Chicago had two solo exhibitions in the United Kingdom in 2012, one in London and another in Liverpool. The Liverpool exhibition included the launch of Chicago's book about Virginia Woolf. Once a peripheral part of her artistic expression, Chicago now considers writing to be well integrated into her career. That year, she was also awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Palm Springs Art Fair. She was interviewed for the film !Women Art Revolution. Chicago strives to push herself, exploring new directions for her art; she even attended car-body school to learn to air-brush and has recently begun to work in glass. Taking such risks is easier to do when one lives by Chicago's philosophy: \\"I'm not career driven. Damien Hirst's dots sold, so he made thousands of dots. I would, like, never do that! It wouldn't even occur to me.\\" Chicago's subject matter, however, has broadened from the focus of The Dinner Party. In the words of the artist: \\"I guess you could say that my eyes were lifted from my vagina.\\" Chicago has permanent collections in numerous museums around the world. Those include, The British Museum, The Brooklyn Museum, The Getty Trust, The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, New Mexico Museum of Art, The National Gallery of Art, The National Museum of Women in the Arts, The Penn Academy of the Fine Arts, and The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. In her interview with Gloria Steinem, Chicago spoke of her \\"goal as an artist\\", stating that it \\"…has been to create images in which the female experience is the path to the universal, as opposed to learning everything through the male gaze.\\"\\"Judy Chicago\\" by Gloria Steinem, December/January 2018 issue of \\"Interview\\", pp. 28–31 Style and work Chicago trained herself in \\"macho arts,\\" taking classes in auto body work, boat building, and pyrotechnics. Through auto body work she learned spray painting techniques and the skill to fuse color and surface to any type of media, which would become a signature of her later work. The skills learned through boat building would be used in her sculpture work, and pyrotechnics would be used to create fireworks for performance pieces. These skills allowed Chicago to bring fiberglass and metal into her sculpture, and eventually she would become an apprentice under Mim Silinsky to learn the art of porcelain painting, which would be used to create works in The Dinner Party. Chicago also added the skill of stained glass to her artistic tool belt, which she used for The Holocaust Project. Photography became more present in Chicago's work as her relationship with photographer Donald Woodman developed.Wylder and Lippard, 6 Since 2003, Chicago has been working with glass. Collaboration is a major aspect of Chicago's installation works. The Dinner Party, The Birth Project and The Holocaust Project were all completed as a collaborative process with Chicago and hundreds of volunteer participants. Volunteer artisans skills vary, often connected to \\"stereotypical\\" women's arts such as textile arts. Chicago makes a point to acknowledge her assistants as collaborators, a task at which other artists have notably failed. Through the Flower In 1978, Chicago founded Through the Flower, a non-profit feminist art organization. The organization seeks to educate the public about the importance of art and how it can be used as a tool to emphasize women's achievements. Through the Flower also serves as the maintainer of Chicago's works, having handled the storage of The Dinner Party, before it found a permanent home at the Brooklyn Museum. The organization also maintained The Dinner Party Curriculum, which serves as a \\"living curriculum\\" for education about feminist art ideas and pedagogy. The online aspect of the curriculum was donated to Penn State University in 2011. Teaching career Judy Chicago became aware of the sexism that was rampant in modern art institutions, museums, and schools while getting her undergraduate and graduate degree at UCLA in the 1960s. Ironically, she didn't challenge this observation as an undergrad. In fact, she did quite the opposite by trying to match – both in her artwork and in her personal style – what she thought of as masculinity in the artistic styles and habits of her male counterparts. Not only did she begin to work with heavy industrial materials, but she also smoked cigars, dressed \\"masculine\\", and attended motorcycle shows. This awareness continued to grow as she recognized how society did not see women as professional artists in the same way they recognized men. Angered by this, Chicago channeled this energy and used it to strengthen her feminist values as a person and teacher. While most teachers based their lessons on technique, visual forms, and color, the foundation for Chicago's teachings were on the content and social significance of the art, especially in feminism. Stemming from the male-dominated art community Chicago studied with for so many years, she valued art based on research, social or political views, and/or experience. She wanted her students to grow into their art professions without having to sacrifice what womanhood meant to them. Chicago developed an art education methodology in which \\"female-centered content,\\" such as menstruation and giving birth, is encouraged by the teacher as \\"personal is political\\" content for art.Chicago, Judy, (n.d.).

Chicago advocates the teacher as facilitator by actively listening to students in order to guide content searches and the translation of content into art. She refers to her teaching methodology as \\"participatory art pedagogy.\\"Keifer-Boyd, K. (2007). From content to form: Judy Chicago's pedagogy with reflections by Judy Chicago.

Several students involved in Judy Chicago's teaching projects established successful careers as artists, including Suzanne Lacy, Faith Wilding, and Nancy Youdelman. In the early 2000s, Chicago organized her teaching style into three parts: preparation, process, and art-making. Each has a specific purpose and is crucial. During the preparation phase, students identify a deep personal concern and then research that issue. In the process phase, students gather together in a group to discuss the materials they plan on using and the content of their work. Finally, in the art-making phase, students find materials, sketch, critique, and produce art.  Books by Chicago  * The Dinner Party: A Symbol of our Heritage.

Along with tranylcypromine and isocarboxazid, phenelzine is one of the few non-selective and irreversible MAOIs still in widespread clinical use. It is taken by mouth. In June 2020, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) reported that the availability of phenelzine was discontinued in Australia due to global issues with the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. However, unapproved phenelzine products may be accessed through alternative pathways, such as the Special Access Scheme (SAS) administered by the TGA. In May 2020, the Specialist Pharmacy Service in the UK reported the unavailability of phenelzine from the sole supplier. In July 2020, supplies of unlicensed phenelzine 15mg capsule specials became available for UK patientshttps://psnc.org.uk/our-news/supply-disruption-alert-phenelzine- sulphate-15mg-tablets-nardil/. Indications Phenelzine is used primarily in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).

Retrieved December 14, 2009 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Web site: The medication is also useful in patients who do not respond favorably to first and second-line treatments for depression, or are \\"treatment- resistant\\". In addition to being a recognized treatment for major depressive disorder, phenelzine is effective in treating dysthymia, bipolar depression (BD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder, bulimia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Phenelzine showed promise in a phase II clinical trial from March 2020 in treating prostate cancer.https://www.cancernetwork.com/prostate-cancer/phase-ii-trial- results-show-promise-phenelzine-prostate- cancer.https://www.curetoday.com/articles/antidepressant-appears-safe- effective-in-men-with-biochemical-recurrent-prostate-cancer Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics Phenelzine is a non-selective and irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). It inhibits both of the respective isoforms of MAO, MAO-A and MAO-B, and does so almost equally, with slight preference for the former. By inhibiting MAO, phenelzine prevents the breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin, melatonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine, as well as the trace amine neuromodulators such as phenethylamine, tyramine, octopamine, and tryptamine. This leads to an increase in the extracellular concentrations of these neurochemicals and therefore an alteration in neurochemistry and neurotransmission. This action is thought to be the primary mediator in phenelzine's therapeutic benefits. Phenelzine and its metabolites also inhibit at least two other enzymes to a lesser extent, of which are alanine transaminase (ALA-T), and γ-Aminobutyric acid transaminase (GABA-T), the latter of which is not caused by phenelzine itself, but by a phenelzine metabolite phenylethylidenehydrazine (PEH). By inhibiting ALA-T and GABA-T, phenelzine causes an increase in the alanine and GABA levels in the brain and body. GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, and is very important for the normal suppression of anxiety, stress, and depression. Phenelzine's action in increasing GABA concentrations may significantly contribute to its antidepressant, and especially, anxiolytic/antipanic properties, the latter of which have been considered superior to those of other antidepressants. As for ALA-T inhibition, though the consequences of disabling this enzyme are currently not well understood, there is some evidence to suggest that it is this action of the hydrazines (including phenelzine) which may be responsible for the occasional incidence of hepatitis and liver failure. Phenelzine has also been shown to metabolize to phenethylamine (PEA). PEA acts as a releasing agent of norepinephrine and dopamine, and produces effects very similar to those of amphetamine, though with markedly different pharmacokinetics such as a far shorter duration of action. Phenelzine's enhancement of PEA levels may contribute further to its overall antidepressant effects to some degree. In addition, phenethylamine is a substrate for MAO-B, and treatment with MAOIs that inhibit MAO-B such as phenelzine have been shown to consistently and significantly elevate its concentrations. Phenelzine usually requires six to eight weeks of treatment, and a minimum dose of 60 mg/day, to achieve therapeutic effects. The reason for the delay in therapeutic effect is not fully understood, but it is believed to be due to many factors, including achieving steady-state levels of MAO inhibition and the resulting adaptations in mean neurotransmitter levels, the possibility of necessary desensitization of autoreceptors which normally inhibit the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, and also the upregulation of enzymes such as serotonin N-acetyltransferase. Typically, a therapeutic response to MAOIs is associated with an inhibition of at least 80-85% of monoamine oxidase activity. Pharmacokinetics Phenelzine 15 mg tablets. Phenelzine is administered orally in the form of phenelzine sulfate and is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Time to peak plasma concentration is 43 minutes and half-life is 11.6 hours. Unlike most other drugs, phenelzine irreversibly disables MAO, and as a result, it does not necessarily need to be present in the blood at all times for its effects to be sustained. Because of this, upon phenelzine treatment being ceased, its effects typically do not actually wear off until the body replenishes its enzyme stores, a process which can take as long as 2–3 weeks. Phenelzine is metabolized primarily in the liver and its metabolites are excreted in the urine. Oxidation is the primary routine of metabolism, and the major metabolites are phenylacetic acid and parahydroxyphenylacetic acid, recovered as about 73% of the excreted dose of phenelzine in the urine over the course of 96 hours after single doses. Acetylation to N2-acetylphenelzine is a minor pathway. Phenelzine may also interact with cytochrome P450 enzymes, inactivating these enzymes through formation of a heme adduct. Two other minor metabolites of phenelzine, as mentioned above, include phenylethylidenehydrazine and phenethylamine. Adverse effects Common side effects of phenelzine may include dizziness, blurry vision, dry mouth, headache, lethargy, sedation, somnolence, insomnia, anorexia, weight gain or loss, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, urinary retention, mydriasis, muscle tremors, hyperthermia, sweating, hypertension or hypotension, orthostatic hypotension, paresthesia, hepatitis, and sexual dysfunction (consisting of loss of libido and anorgasmia). Rare side effects usually only seen in susceptible individuals may include hypomania or mania, psychosis and acute liver failure, the last of which is usually only seen in people with pre-existing liver damage, old age, long-term effects of alcohol consumption, or viral infection.  Interactions  The MAOIs have certain dietary restrictions and drug interactions. The amount of such restrictions and interactions is far less than previously thought, and MAOIs are generally safe medications when administered correctly. Hypertensive crisis is generally a rare occurrence while taking MAOIs,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333105108_The_risk_of_harm_from_acute_tyramine- induced_hypertension_how_significant yet may result from the overconsumption of tyramine-containing foods. As a result, patients on phenelzine and other MAOIs must avoid excess quantities of certain foods that contain tyramine such as aged cheeses and cured meats, among others. Serotonin syndrome may result from an interaction with certain drugs which increase serotonin activity such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin releasing agents, and serotonin agonists. Several deaths have been reported due to drug interaction- related serotonin syndrome such as the case of Libby Zion. As is the case with other MAOIs, there is a concern regarding phenelzine and the use of both local and general anesthetics. Anyone taking phenelzine should inform their dentist before proceeding with dental surgery, and surgeon in any other contexts. Phenelzine has also been linked to vitamin B6 deficiency. Transaminases such as GABA-transaminase have been shown to be dependent upon vitamin B6; and may be involved in a potentially related process, since the phenelzine metabolite phenylethylidenehydrazine (PEH) is a GABA transaminase inhibitor. Both phenelzine and vitamin B6 are rendered inactive upon these reactions occurring. For this reason, it may be recommended to supplement with vitamin B6 while taking phenelzine. The pyridoxine form of B6 is recommended for supplementation, since this form has been shown to reduce hydrazine toxicity from phenelzine and, in contrast, the pyridoxal form has been shown to increase the toxicity of hydrazines.

This variant was never a big seller. the company decided that all commercial vehicles produced by its Austin-Morris division should be badged as Austins. How this was applied to motor caravan conversions (SunTor) of those commercial vehicles is apparent from the \\"Austin-Morris\\" badge on the front of this one. The Morris Marina is a small family car that was manufactured by Austin-Morris division of British Leyland from 1971 until 1980. It served to replace the Morris Minor in the Morris product line, which had first been built in 1948. The Marina was also sold in some markets as the Austin Marina,Morris Marina/Ital : The Austins, www.aronline.co.uk Retrieved on 22 June 2013 the Leyland Marina and the Morris 1700. It was a popular car in Britain throughout its production life, beating its main rival, the Ford Escort, to second place in UK car sales in 1973 and taking third or fourth place (behind the Escort) in other years. The car was exported throughout the world, including North America, and assembled in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Malaysia. According to various sources, the Marina ranks among the worst cars ever built. The 1980 replacement for the Marina, the Ital, was the same car with only mild styling changes. It was only fully replaced by the Austin Maestro in 1983. British Leyland sold the Marina alongside the 1969 Austin Maxi, which shared the same market segment, but used front-wheel-drive and had a hatchback body, and the 1973 Austin Allegro, which used front-wheel-drive and more adventurous styling. Development The Marina was developed under the ADO28 codename. The impetus for its development came when Leyland Motors merged with British Motor Holdings (BMH) in 1968, thus forming British Leyland. BMH was the corporate parent of the two biggest car manufacturers in the UK, Austin and Morris. The new BL management, made largely from ex-Leyland Motors staff, were shocked to learn that apart from the Austin Maxi (then entering the final stages of development) and a tentative design for a replacement for the Mini (the 9X) BMH had no new cars under development. The company's products aimed at the mass-market consisted of the Morris Minor, dating from 1948, and the 1100/1300 range of mid-sized Austin and Morris saloons that were a decade old. BL rapidly implemented a plan to develop a replacement for both the Minor and the smaller Farina models that could be produced as quickly as possible and would be on sale for no more than five years until a genuinely \\"all new\\" product could be launched in its place. To try to introduce some clear distinctions between its multiple brands BL decided to release conservative, traditionally engineered cars under the Morris name, and sell more adventurous cars as Austins, or even as new marques – such as the Austin Allegro and Princess, the former of which occupied the same small family car segment as the Marina would. Specifically this meant that Austins use the groundbreaking transverse-engine front-wheel-drive layout developed by Alec Issigonis. It was thus decided that the ADO28 would be badged as a Morris. The Marina would use a conventional rear-wheel drive, live rear axle drive-train as found on other popular mass-market cars such as the Ford Escort and Vauxhall Viva. This strategy was also intended to improve sales in BL's export markets. Commonwealth markets such as South Africa, Australia and New Zealand were large buyers of BL products, but the innovative BMC cars were considered too fragile and complex for use in such countries, as well as being fitted exclusively with small, low-powered engines. As a result, the Marina was unadventurous but simple, making use of existing BMC components derived from the Morris Minor and MGB, as well as using mainly Triumph Dolomite transmission and running gear from the former Leyland side of the organisation. The car was designed by Roy Haynes, the same man who designed the Ford Cortina Mark II (launched in 1966), with which it shares some stylistic similarities. Lacking the budget to develop two cars to compete directly with the Escort and the Cortina, the makers sized the ADO28 between the two benchmark Ford models. Haynes' original idea was to produce the car in coupé and saloon versions with the coupé pitched as a premium, sporting version, in a similar mould to the Ford Capri - a popular coupé based on Cortina running gear - to appeal to younger buyers, while the saloon was for the crucial company car market and families. Haynes also attempted to put forward a system that many manufacturers now use: a common floor pan shared between models. The Marina was the first car design that used this idea. Although this idea carried great potential benefits for a company selling cars under numerous different brands across multiple market sectors it was looked on as too radical by the management of British Leyland and Triumph designer Harry Webster was drafted in to push the project forward. Roy Haynes soon left the company. The British Leyland Board decided to build the Marina at the ex- Morris Motors plant at Cowley in Oxford, which was largely still as it was in the 1920s. The plant had insufficient capacity – British manufacturers had difficulties in meeting demand in the post-war years – which increased design and production costs significantly, since Leyland had to rebuild the plant. The Marina was originally designed to use the E-series OHC BMC engines. These engines had a number of design problems. A modular engine design, the E series had standard bores, with capacity increased by using either more cylinders or larger strokes. However, small-capacity sixes fell out of favour as post-war Britain became increasingly affluent. To increase capacity, BL preferred increasing stroke, which added little to the cost of production. This resulted in a tall engine. It was not possible to slant the engine, because of the location of the fuel pump. Furthermore, the engine had to be \\"siamesed\\", that is, the water jacket was shared between pairs of cylinders. These factors contributed to overheating and oil burning in the Austin Maxi, and so the board decided to adopt the more reliable A and B- series engines for indigenous production. (Australia and South Africa continued with the E series.) However, the body had already been designed, so the Marina was forever cursed with a \\"full nappy\\" rear-end styling, needed to even the lines between the necessarily bloated front and the rear. The engine assembly line was bifurcated by a municipal road; Leyland had to build an overpass, further increasing cost. The Birmingham local authority then agreed to sell the road to Leyland after the overpass had been completed. This increased the cost even further. Numerous redesigns also meant that the final design of the Marina was rushed, as the project's final deadline grew near. The car went from design stage to production in just 18 months. Consequently, the board decided to cut costs and abandon Macpherson struts in favour of an old design from the Morris Minor. They also abandoned a project to design a new 4-speed BMC gearbox. As a further cost-cutting measure the coupé version of the Marina would now use the same front doors as the saloon version. This produced significant cost savings in tooling and assembly, but left the coupé as obvious styling derivative of the saloon rather than having a different, more sporting image as Roy Haynes had originally proposed. This made it impossible to pitch the coupé as a superior product, and so it was decided that the 2-door coupé version of the Marina would be the cheaper of the two body styles, with the 1.3-litre model directly replacing the entry-level 2-door version of the Morris Minor and competing with the 2-door saloon versions of the Ford Escort and the Hillman Avenger. Meanwhile, the 1.8-litre coupé models had no direct predecessor in the BL range and the closest equivalents were the sporting Ford Capri and the new Vauxhall Firenza. This gave the coupé a rather conflicted image - the sporty bodystyle led many buyers and testers to have expectations of the Marina coupé that the final product was never intended to meet, being mechanically identical to the standard saloon version. The Marina saloons more obvious market placements; the 1.3-litre saloon replaced the 4-door Minor while the 1.8-litre version superseded the Austin and Morris Farina saloons and the 1.8-litre Marina estate did the same for the outgoing estate versions of the Farina. The dashboard also suffered from being ergonomically illogical, with the radio and warning light controls facing away from the driver towards the passenger seat. The indigenous engines were the venerable A-Series and B-Series units in 1.3- and 1.8-litre capacities, respectively, which drove rear wheels through a live axle. It featured torsion bar suspension at the front, leaf-spring suspension at the rear. An estate (station wagon) came in 1972, 18 months after the saloon and coupé, giving British Leyland a full- circle competitor for the Cortina and Capri. Five body styles were available all in all: saloon, estate, coupé, pickup, and van. For extra performance, TC versions were equipped with a twin carburettor engine similar to that in the MG MGB for extra performance. These could be fitted with a body kit from BL Special Tuning that added front and rear spoilers, alloy wheels, extra lighting and other details. A 1.5-litre diesel version, using an engine developed from the B-Series, was offered in a few European countries where the tax rates favoured diesels. With no more than 37 or 40 hp on offer depending on the source, performance was often lethargic; 3,870 diesels were built between 1977 and 1980. They were never sold in Britain, where diesel engines were almost unheard of in passenger cars. Launch and subsequent updates The new car was launched on the domestic market on 27 April 1971, with a night shift added at the Cowley plant in May 1971. At that time the manufacturers reported they were producing 2,000 cars per week, projecting over- optimistically to increase this to 5,000 cars per week by the end of 1971. Nevertheless, eleven months after launch, on 29 March 1972, the 100,000th Marina, a 1.8TC version, emerged from the Cowley plant and by February 1973 the company was able to announce that 250,000 Marinas had already been built in less than two years. The Marina continued in production from 1971 to 1980, when it was replaced by the Morris Ital (an updated version of the Marina) which continued in production until 1984, when the Morris marque was axed and the Austin badge featured on the Montego that replaced it, signalling the end of the Morris brand after more than 70 years. (With the discontinuation of the Morris 18-22 – also sold as an Austin and Wolseley – the Marina car and the Ital were the only noncommercial vehicles sold with the Morris badge after 1975.) In Australia and South Africa it was known as the Leyland Marina, in New Zealand as the Morris 1.7 (for 1979–81, in face-lifted O-Series form), and in North America as the Austin Marina. The car was popular with families and undemanding car buyers, and was available in the typical BL colours of the dayRusset Brown, Harvest Gold, Limeflower Green, Midnight Blue, Teal Blue, Blaze Orange, Damask Red and a characteristically 1970s purple called Black Tulip. It was intended to compete with the generally similar Ford Cortina (and to some extent the smaller Escort); the Vauxhall Viva and later the larger Cavalier; as well as the Hillman Avenger and Hunter from Chrysler UK. It shared its basic styling with all these cars, adopting a supposedly transatlantic look that took elements of car styling from contemporary American cars (especially the front-end treatment in the Marina's case) and offered them at a scale acceptable to the European market. As with its mechanics, the Marina was not intended to be visually innovative or particularly interestingits Austin Allegro stablemate was the entry in that area of the market. A point of criticism with the Marina was that the windscreen-wiper set-up was \\"opposite\\" the driver. This was decided pre- production after drivers of the prototypes reported that airflow at certain speeds made the wiper closest to the A-post lift off the windscreen, potentially disrupting the driver's line of sight. The problem was judged sufficiently serious that the car went on sale with a wiper position as if for driving on the other side of the road, though subsequent road testers questioned the effectiveness of this decision and the basis for it. BL was beset with problems including industrial action throughout the period, and the Marina was one of a number of models that suffered. While the labour disputes at BL eroded employment, manufacturers in Europe and Japan introduced innovative designs (such as the VW Golf) with which the Marina and its like were never likely to compete. Problems were compounded as the cars to replace the Marina and BL's other mid-size offerings were repeatedly delayed (eventually appearing as the Austin Maestro and Austin Montego in 1983–84). By this time Leyland had abandoned the idea of separate Austin and Morris ranges. There was not enough money to develop a full range of rear-wheel-drive Morris cars and an equivalent front-wheel-drive (FWD) Austin range, and FWD was increasingly accepted across the market. There were changes, however, albeit small ones. A facelift in 1975 gave the Marina new radiator grilles, dashboard, seats, suspension modifications and increased soundproofing. In May 1977 Marinas started to appear at dealers equipped with Allegro style seats: apart from rationalising the procuring and production processes, this was said to make the Marina seating more comfortable and supportive. The overhead camshaft O-Series engine (also used for Leyland Princess) appeared in 1.7-litre form in 1978 to replace the larger B-Series 1.8-litre models. A changed grille, including driving lights, a front spoiler and redesigned bumpers and rear lights, were added to all models. Under severe financial strain, BL was bailed out by the government under the Ryder Report of 1975, and Sir Michael Edwardes was brought in to oversee the company. Under his leadership, BL made an attempt to update the Marina, by enlisting the help of Giorgetto Giugiaro's Italdesign. ItalDesign, however, did not design the car, which was an in-house product — it merely made changes to its appearance. The result of this exercise, the 1980 Morris Ital features large rear-lamp clusters and a new front end, but the 1971 vintage of the design was obvious. The Ital lasted four years and was replaced by the Austin Montego in early 1984. Popularity The Marina's public life did not get off to a good start. The rushed final stages of design and production, especially in regard to the suspension, meant that many of the press fleet cars had an incorrect front- suspension set-up, whereby there was no camber change when the car rolled, which in turn produced \\"almost heroic\\" levels of understeer: Autocar reported that the car they were driving ended up on the wrong side of the road when taking a sharp corner. This was a particular problem with the more powerful 1.8 and 1.8 TC cars, which were unfortunately the models the press were most likely to test, though the 1.3-litre models with their lighter engine did not suffer from the problem to the same extent. Early production Marinas were fitted with the original front suspension, although a different lower link-arm (trunnion) was fitted quite quickly. The best estimate is that about 30,000 cars with the original suspension were sold to the public: many, though not all, had their front suspension set-up retrospectively corrected by dealers and before September 1971, less than six months after launch, front-suspension \\"uprights\\" were being modified on the production line. The Marina was never intended, or designed, to have particularly exciting or sharp handling, but the early problems led to less-than-flattering road-test reports and it was undeniable that the Marina's handling always tended towards understeer, which for a rear-wheel-drive car was unusual, and towards body-roll. What Car? magazine, in a typical review, described the understeer as \\"noticeable\\", but called the car as a whole \\"unobtrusively well designed\\". More comprehensive suspension changes were made with the Mark 2's introduction in 1975, which added anti-roll bars that calmed the earlier car's wayward tendencies. In 1982 the Ital changed its Marina-derived front lever-arm shock absorbers for telescopic ones. Despite heavy criticism from the media and motoring press, the car's lack of technical sophistication let it be keenly priced. The Morris Marina was a very popular car in Britain, and was among the country's best sellers throughout its production life, peaking at second place in 1973 — only surpassed by the Ford Cortina. In many ways, the car fulfilled its design goal of being an unpretentious, high volume, mass-market car for average-income families and business people. The deliberately simple and apparently old- fashioned design of the Marina was intended mainly to appeal to company-car and corporate-fleet buyers. This market was dominated by Ford with the Escort and Cortina. BL's Austin products, with their advanced front-wheel drive and suspension systems were more expensive to buy and more costly to maintain, and so suffered poorer sales in these crucial markets. The Marina's front-engined, rear-wheel-drive, live-rear-axle layout was identical to the Ford products and most other mass-production saloons of the day. Although Ford remained dominant by a large margin, the Marina did succeed in capturing a larger share of the fleet/hire market and this contributed to its high sales. However, its image remained as a rather dull, workaday vehicle. Marina production lasted almost ten years, and in that time no fewer than 807,000 were sold across Britain, though it was less popular on export markets. By the time production of the facelifted Ital version ceased production in 1984, total Marina/Ital production had topped 1.2 million, making it BL's second biggest seller after the Mini. In fact, of all the post Ryder Report models that BL and its successors produced, only the Austin Metro would surpass the Marina's sales. Whilst intended as a stop-gap design until a more up-to-date replacement could be developed, the problems faced by British Leyland in the mid-to-late 1970s meant that the Marina remained in production essentially unchanged, other than some light face-lift and interior changes. Coupled with the continuing quality problems suffered by the car and the increasingly poor perception of BL cars as a whole, this sealed the Marina's reputation, despite its high sales. Even when Marina production ended in 1980, a modified version of it survived until 1984 as the Ital. British Leyland had been working on an all-new replacement for the Marina by 1980, but it was too early in the development stages to enter production, with production not beginning until early 1984, when the new car, called the Austin Montego, was launched. Over the years, it has frequently been described by journalists, authors and motoring critics as one of the worst cars of all time. The relaunching of the then decade-old design as the Morris Ital only added to the image of an outdated, outclassed, and poor-performing vehicle. Legacy A survey conducted by Auto Express magazine in August 2006 reported that 745 of the 807,000 Marinas sold in Britain were still on the road, fewer than one of every thousand sold, making it the most-scrapped car sold in Britain over the previous 30 years. The low survival rate is due to a combination of factors, chief amongst which is the Marina's poor rust-proofing. Like other family saloon cars of the period, the Marina did not gain the status of a classic car, whilst large numbers were still in good enough condition to encourage preservation. The Marina also made a good donor car for several other British Leyland models. The brakes and suspension from a Marina were/are often used to upgrade the Morris Minor, whilst the A and B-Series engines were used in a wide variety of other cars. The 1275 cc A Series, for example, made an easy performance improvement for a Midget or Sprite, whilst the twin-carb B-Series engine used in the TC versions of the Marina fitted the MGB without any modifications needed, and the TC engine carried a slightly higher power output. Factors such as these meant that elderly Marinas were more likely to be stripped for parts to upgrade more popular models than to be repaired or restored. Top Gear vilifies the Morris Marina; a running gag throughout the series involved dropping a piano on a Marina every time the car is featured, generating angry reactions by Morris Marina lovers, dubbed \\"Morris Extremists\\" whose letters would be read out and mocked in subsequent episodes. In the Top Gear book Crap Cars by Richard Porter, the Marina was named fourth worst car of all time. However, presenter James May stated that at least one Marina should be preserved, as a warning to future generations. In February 2016 it was reported that the number of Marinas still on Britain's roads was 295, although this figure does not count examples which are SORN. As of December 2019 there is currently 374 Marinas on the road in Britain, with a further 498 currently SORN.

To ease production and reduce costs, the body featured a strong central spine around the transmission tunnel, where most of the unit's strength was. The rear dampers were inclined inboard from the axle to their top mounts on this spine, rather than being mounted vertically on dedicated top mounts built into the body at the rear-wheel arches. This limited the effectiveness of the dampers somewhat (they were dissipating vertical motion when mounted at an angle), and when combined with the live rear axle, made the rear end prone to \\"bump steer\\" on rough roads. A similar setup was used on the early Ford Escort for the same reasons of cost-effective construction, but Ford revised the arrangement on later models. BL lacked the funds to retool the Marina's design significantly, and so all models were fitted in this less-than-ideal way. The front suspension was closely derived from that on the Morris Minor, using longitudinal torsion bars for springing. The rest of the front suspension consisted of lower arms pivoting on trunnions with upper ball joints supporting the wheel and acting on hydraulic lever arm dampers. These provided superior ride comfort over rough roads when compared to early telescopic dampers, but at the expense of sloppy handling and body control at high speeds. Improvements in road surfaces, the development of the motorway network, the huge increase in the performance of even standard family cars and advances in the design of telescopic dampers since the Minor was launched in 1948 made this type of damper obsolete by 1971. Nonetheless it was adopted to keep development and tooling costs to a minimum. British Leyland's Special Tuning department (which primarily handled development of BL's works' motor-sport cars and technical support to private entries using BL products) produced a variety of upgrades for the Marina, which were (technically) available on road cars through special order. Amongst the S/T products were a kit to adapt the front suspension to use telescopic dampers (eventually fitted to the Ital), and adaptor kits to convert the rear dampers to a more effective vertical orientation using separate turrets. The S/T suspension upgrades produced significant improvements in handling and ride over the standard Marina, but were not widely publicised on the general market. The troublesome manual gearbox was a four-speed unit with synchromesh on all gears except reverse, and was derived from the Triumph Toledo unit, controlled by a floor- mounted lever. Automatic transmission was a conventional Borg Warner Type 35 3 Speed transmission and was offered at extra cost. North America The Marina was available in the United States as the Austin Marina from 1973 to 1975 in two and four-door forms. It was marketed as an Austin, because Morris was a virtually unknown brand in the US, and to capitalise on the success of the Austin-Healey marque. The 1973 model still had the normal small bumpers, but the 1974/5 models had large bumpers to comply with new US regulations. It was only produced with the 1.8-litre engine, and was soon strangled by the emissions equipment that U.S. law required — an air pump and exhaust air injection. The US government soon accused BL of dumping cars in the US, which, combined with tales of poor quality, made it a poor seller, and they were not exported to the US after 1975. The Marina was also marketed in Canada as the Austin Marina, in two-door coupé and four-door saloon forms, from 1972 and 1973 to 1978, using only the 1.8-litre engine, fitted with US-style heavier bumpers and emissions equipment. Sales ceased when the 1.8 was replaced by a 1.7-litre engine, which was not emissions-certified in Canada. While its simple rear-wheel-drive layout and mechanicals appealed to many Canadian drivers, the Marina's body was prone to extremely fast rust-out on the salted winter roads of eastern Canada, which limited sales in later years. Denmark In Denmark, the Morris 1100 & Morris 1300 models were marketed under the Morris Marina name from 1962 to 1972.BMC 1100/1300 : Danish variations, www.aronline.co.uk Retrieved on 13 January 2013 Australia Leyland Marina Super 4 Door Leyland Marina Super 4 Door The Marina was introduced to the Australian market in April 1972 as the Morris Marina Glass's Dealer Guide, SA & NT Edition, June 1973, page 90 and then, following a change in marketing policy, sold there from 1973 under the Leyland Marina name.Morris Marina - History in Australia Retrieved on 1 April 2012 From that time a restyled grille was used on all models. The Australian Marina, which was sold in sedan and coupé forms only, used the OHC E-Series four-cylinder motor in 1500 cc, 1750 cc and 1750 cc twin carburettor form.Leyland Australia's Morris Marina sales brochure (undated, but almost certainly from 1972) Additionally, in an attempt to compete with the Holden Torana and Ford Cortina 6-cylinder models, the Marina was also offered from November 1973 Green Book Guide, March–April 1984, page 56 with a 121 hp (90 kW) 2600 cc E-series six-cylinder engine. This indigenous Marina variant was capable of 0–60 mph in under nine seconds. The Australian Marinas were built from CKD kits sent from Cowley in England, but used high levels of local content, including different running gear, axle, interiors, seals, seats, uprated dampers and mounts, uprated wheels and a higher grade of fit and finish. The Marina Six used a separate front sub-frame to support the weight of the Big Red engine and different front torsion bars as well as a pair of rear radius arms in an attempt to improve handling. Base model featured a 3-speed manual gearbox – sourced locally from Borg-Warner – to meet local content requirements. The Borg-Warner automatic was, however, the variation most popular in the local market. Surprisingly, the three-speed manual gearbox, was mechanically a four-speed box with first gear blanked off. This was done due to the perceived high torque of the engine, so that first gear was deemed unnecessary. Leyland Australia were known for their own development and a version of the Rover V8 was converted into a V6 and test fitted to a Marina saloon. Production of the Marina in Australia ended in 1975,Leyland Marina Retrieved from autocade.net on 23 July 2010 when Leyland Australia's Victoria Park, Zetland factory (home of the Leyland P76) closed. A replacement model, the P82, was under development in 1974, but did not reach production.Leyland P82 Retrieved from www.aronline.co.uk on 23 July 2010 Over 30,000 Marinas were produced in Australia. New Zealand The Morris Marina was a popular car on the New Zealand market, imported by the New Zealand Motor Corporation. Imports began with built-up British-sourced saloons and coupes (in 1.3- and 1.8-litre forms) in 1971. Local assembly of Australian-sourced (E-Series engines) models began in 1972 after the release of the Marinas there. Six-cylinder models were added in 1973. In 1974, before the termination of Leyland Australia's manufacturing operations, local assembly switched to British-sourced models again in saloon, estate, van and pick-up forms. Batches of fully built UK-sourced cars also came in 1973 and 1974 when the government allowed additional import licences due to the inability of local assembly plants to keep pace with demand for new cars. In 1979 the Marina received a face lift and the BL O-Series OHC 1.7-litre engine. However, at the time the Marina name was held in low regard by the New Zealand public, and was dropped, the car being renamed Morris 1700. The Morris 1700 had high equipment levels and included front spoilers and driving lights on all models. The related van and pick-up models were renamed Morris 575. Production of the car ceased in 1981. It was replaced locally by an expanded range of NZMC Honda products. South Africa As in Australia, the car received the E-series engine, but was marketed as the Austin Marina. The 1.75-litre four and the 2.6-litre six were offered. Power outputs are . The 2600 was also available with a three-speed Borg Warner Type 35 automatic gearbox. After a June 1976 face lift, including a new grille with integrated spotlights and a redone interior, the 1750 became available with the automatic while the manual 2600 was dropped. This face-lift version was called the Marina Series III. The new padded dashboard was of a unified swept design with an integrated binnacle for the instruments, and had been used in British Marinas since the 1975 face lift. The 1.3 motor was offered from 1976 until 1978, but the build quality combined with the grossly underpowered 1.3 version (particularly for the South African Highveld where heat and altitude cut engine performance by up to 20%) made it an absolute failure. The remnants of the production run were sold off at up to 50% discount on their list price. Rallying In 1970 Donald Stokes ordered the BMC Competitions Department closed and disbanded. By the time the Marina appeared, it was becoming obvious that Stage Rallying was gaining popularity, and in early 1971 it was decided to use the new model in the November 1971 RAC rally. Luckily for BL, Special Tuning had a rally driver on its books by the name of Brian Culcheth and so with no team, no mechanics, no funding and initially no sponsorship a team of talented engineers developed a 1.3 coupé into a rally car, funded purely by sales of performance parts from Special Tuning. Knowing that the 1.8-litre engine was too heavy for decent handling, they concentrated on the 1.3-litre engine and using Mini components got good horsepower figures from it; then they played a flanker to pen the field in the 1.3 classes. All rally teams used one particular course to test, so the car was fitted with a full-race 1.8 and blasted around the track in front of the Ford rally team – consequently they withdrew from the 1.3 class allowing the car to claim 1st in Class for the 1971 Rally. Subsequently, the car was entered in 17 more national and international rallies up to 1975, either being placed or winning class honours in twelve of them, the others being crashes/failures. In South Africa, the local Leyland subsidiary also rallied the Marina for several years. These were serious machines, fitted originally with the Rover V8 and later with a 200-horsepower Triumph Dolomite Sprint engine. Leykor chose the heavier and less powerful Dolomite engine since more performance parts, including a close- ratio five-speed transmission, were available. With the appearance of the SD1 this situation changed again, but the Dolomite engine was used into 1977 at least. For 1976 BL management decided to move to the Triumph Dolomite Sprint for its main rallying weapon. In 1974 Foden commissioned a Rover V8-engined Marina to compete in the UDT London–Sahara–Sydney Marathon rally. Driven by Major John Hemsley and Major John Skinner, the car stormed through several stages before suffering rear-axle failure in the desert. John Hemsley started the rally with his left arm in a cast having broken his wrist, leaving John Skinner to change gear for him during the special stages. The rear axle had been the only part obtained from a non-BL source. Post-demise During the early 1970s, George Turnbull was retired from BL and took two Marinas, one saloon and one coupé, to a small car company in Korea which was interested in developing its own car, instead of making other people's cast-offs. Hyundai took the Marinas and developed the Hyundai Pony from them, in three, four and five-door variants, a station wagon, and a pick-up, kick-starting the company's ascendancy in car manufacturing. The Marina lived on in many smaller ways: many parts from the Marina were used in other British Leyland vehicles. The door handles from the Marina were utilized in the Austin Allegro, Range Rover, Triumph TR7, and the first series of Land Rover Discovery, until 1998. Very early Range Rovers did not use these door handles, though. They were also used by some models of the Reliant Scimitar, and by various Lotus cars, including some versions of the Lotus Esprit. The indicator switchgear, also used on the Triumph Stag, eventually became part of the Lamborghini Diablo. Marina-sourced gearboxes were used in the MG Midget 1500 version.

During the early 2000s, she released two top-selling albums: The Spirit Room and Hotel Paper. She won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals with Santana for \\"The Game of Love\\". In 2005, she formed the country music duo The Wreckers with friend and fellow musician Jessica Harp, and produced the Grammy-nominated single \\"Leave the Pieces\\". The Wreckers disbanded in 2007 to pursue their respective solo careers. Since then, she has released extended plays in 2010 and 2011, and a third solo album, Hopeless Romantic, on 7 April 2017. Early life and education Branch was born on July 2, 1983, in Sedona, Arizona, to David and Peggy Branch. Her father is Irish, and her mother is of Dutch-Indonesian (\\"Indo\\") and French descent. Her maternal grandmother was held in a Japanese concentration camp during World War II. After the war she moved to Holland, where Branch's mother was born. They moved to Arizona when her mother was five. Her siblings include an older half-brother named David and a younger sister named Nicole. Beginning to sing at the age of three, Branch enrolled in voice lessons at Northern Arizona University when she was eight, and received her first guitar for her 14th birthday. After teaching herself chords, she composed her first song \\"Fallen\\" within a week of receiving her guitar. She initially attended Sedona Red Rock High School, but finished the last two years of her high school education through home schooling so that she could focus on her music career. Career 1983–2000: Broken Bracelet To support Branch's interests, her parents helped her book local gigs in Sedona, and later financed her independent album Broken Bracelet. Her set list at these gigs included covers of songs by Sheryl Crow, Lisa Loeb, Jewel, and Fleetwood Mac. In December 1999, she posted two of her songs on the Rolling Stone website, which caught the attention of both pop rock band Hanson and former Rolling Stone writer and Los Angeles record producer Jeff Rabhan, eventually leading to two gigs opening for Hanson in 2000. In June 2000, Branch self-produced Broken Bracelet, a compilation of songs she wrote when she was 14 and 15; the album was released on the independent record label Twin Dragon Records. Its title was inspired from a bracelet made by pop singer Jewel, given to Branch by musician Steve Poltz at a Lisa Loeb concert she attended. Poltz told Branch that \\"when it breaks, you'll be famous.\\" The Broken Bracelet recordings were destroyed in the Nashville floods in May 2010. 2001–2005: The Spirit Room and Hotel Paper Branch performing in October 2003. In 2001, Branch signed a recording deal with Maverick Records, where she began working with John Shanks to produce her first album and major-label debut. The album, The Spirit Room, was released in August 2001, producing the hit single \\"Everywhere\\". The single was a commercial success, winning the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards Viewer's Choice Award. \\"Everywhere\\" was later followed by singles \\"All You Wanted\\" and \\"Goodbye to You\\". In August 2001, she appeared on Total Request Live after \\"Everywhere\\" reached No. 4 on the show's chart. Due to the mainstream success of those released singles, The Spirit Room was certified Double Platinum by the RIAA for selling over two million copies in the United States.RIAA Certification.

RIAA Retrieved April 12, 2017. However, the album was met with mixed reviews. The lead single, \\"Are You Happy Now?\\", was a chart success, earning Branch a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, though the song lost to Pink's \\"Trouble\\". The following singles, however, \\"Breathe\\" and \\"'Til I Get over You\\", did not match the first single's success. Branching out into television, she appeared in several shows, including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, American Dreams, and Charmed. In June 2004, she hosted MTV's \\"Faking the Video\\" alongside Nick Lachey and JC Chasez. She also appeared in the Rob Schneider film The Hot Chick. 2005–2007: The Wreckers Michelle Branch (center) during a June 2007 concert with Jessica Harp (right) as The Wreckers. In July 2005, Branch began collaborating with her backup singer and longtime friend Jessica Harp. They were initially known as \\"The Cass County Homewreckers\\" as a joke by Branch's husband, but they trimmed it down to The Wreckers. Their album attempted to combine their respective genres—pop rock and country. It was originally slated for release in June 2005 but was delayed because of reasons surrounding Branch's pregnancy. The duo's first single \\"Leave the Pieces\\" was released in February 2006, while their album Stand Still, Look Pretty was released in May. During this period, they contributed to Santana's album All That I Am, with the song \\"I'm Feeling You\\", appearing on the American teen television drama One Tree Hill, and joined country music stars Rascal Flatts on a U.S. tour. They initially toured with Gavin DeGraw, Tyler Hilton and Bethany Joy Galeotti, which was also written into the show during the second season. The group was nominated for the 2006 CMA Awards Vocal Duo of the Year and for a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for the song \\"Leave the Pieces\\" in December 2006. Stand Still, Look Pretty was certified Gold by the RIAA with sales of 851,000 copies as of March 2009. The Wreckers split in 2007. Branch sold her Calabasas, California home and moved to Nashville, Tennessee. 2008–2012: Unreleased albums Branch performing in August 2009. Immediately thereafter, Branch wrote an unreleased song for Mandy Moore's 2007 album Wild Hope, and also wrote \\"Together\\" for the soundtrack of The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2; it was also featured as the final song ever played on the CBS TV soap opera, Guiding Light. In October 2007, she announced that she was working on a new solo album and later reported the title would be Everything Comes and Goes. In June 2008, she played several live shows in preparation for the album's release with her sister Nicole singing backing vocals. In early 2009, she sang the song \\"I Lose My Heart\\" in a duet with Chris Isaak on his new album Mr. Lucky. A video for the first single from the album \\"Sooner Or Later\\" was released on July 28, 2009. Also in 2009, she recorded \\"A Case of You\\" (originally by Joni Mitchell) for the compilation Covered, A Revolution in Sound which commemorated Warner Bros. Records 50th anniversary. A video was made for the song \\"This Way\\" and uploaded to Branch's official YouTube account in October 2009, but it was not released as a single and did not chart. (The video was included on a limited edition DVD entitled The Video Anthology available on michellebranch.com.) Everything Comes and Goes was finally released as a six-track extended play on July 16, 2010, via Branch's website and would be available at all retailers one month later. In 2010, Branch and R&B;/hip-hop producer Timbaland collaborated on a pop/R&B; song entitled \\"Getaway\\" and released a video. In December 2010, Branch announced her return to her pop/rock roots for her album, West Coast Time. In early 2011, Branch released three previously unreleased songs from Everything Comes and Goes including, \\"Texas In the Mirror\\", \\"Take a Chance on Me\\", and \\"Long Goodbye\\", the latter a duet with Dwight Yoakam. On March 22, 2011, in a video regarding updates on the third studio album uploaded via Branch's YouTube account, Branch confirmed that half the album is finished and added that \\"it's sounding really really good....it's all going well and it's all on time.\\" On April 14, 2011, it was announced that Branch had finished recording the album, she also added that \\"only mixing/mastering left. Michelle practiced and recorded a few tracks with Tilted Head and FIVE lead singer Joshua Barton, however it is still a work in progress.\\" On May 26, 2011, Branch hosted a live webchat with fans in which she previewed her new single \\"Loud Music\\", which was released to the iTunes Store on June 14, 2011. The song was co-written and produced by British writers Jim Irvin and Julian Emery who collaborated with Michelle on several songs on the album. In the webcast, Branch also mentioned songs on the album called \\"Mastermind\\" and \\"The Story Of Us\\" and also added that \\"Through The Radio\\" would be a hidden track on the CD. In a previous webcast, she premiered a song from the album called \\"Spark\\". During a live outdoor performance at the Warner Brothers building she performed another new song, dedicated to her then-husband Teddy Landau, \\"For Dear Life\\". In June 2011, she released the album's first single titled \\"Loud Music\\". It has charted on the Adult Pop Songs chart. On July 12, 2011, Branch performed \\"God Bless America\\" at the MLB All-Star Game, in Phoenix, Arizona. In September, a new song \\"Another Sun\\" was featured on Fox's TV series Terra Nova. On October 29, 2011, she gave a small concert to approximately 200 fans at the Egyptian Room in downtown Indianapolis, as part of the Gravedigger's Ball. On December 12, 2011, Branch released a song titled \\"If You Happen to Call\\" for free download on the official website. In February 2012, VH1 hosted the \\"100 Greatest Women In Music\\" special and she was nominated in both the \\"Pop\\" category and the \\"Greatest Female Artist of All Time\\". On April 3, 2012, Branch performed \\"Leave the Pieces\\" with Kelly Clarkson in Los Angeles as part of Clarkson's Stronger Tour. On September 5, the singer premiered a new pop-rock track \\"Mastermind\\". In September 2012, Branch joined Chef Michael Mina as a co-host of Cook Taste Eat, an online cooking show that aims to teach viewers how to cook quality food at home. As with her release, Everything Comes and Goes, West Coast Time has seen numerous delays for, as yet, unknown reasons. Branch has confirmed on her Twitter account that she knows as much as the fans do about this. In January 2011, Branch confirmed in an interview with Katie Krause from Hollywire.com that the album would be released later that year. On June 1, 2011, Branch announced that the album is called West Coast Time and slated for a September 2011 release date. On December 25, 2012, Branch confirmed that West Coast Time was scheduled for release in Spring 2013, but the album has not yet been released. 2013–present: New record deal and Hopeless Romantic Branch performs at Slim's in San Francisco, July 21, 2017. For much of 2013, Branch wrote songs and moved on from the unreleased West Coast Time. On November 5, 2013, Branch announced that she had started recording a new album in London with Martin Terefe. On February 2, 2014, she confirmed on Twitter that the rest of the album would be recorded in Nashville for a pop-rock sound. In October 2014, she recorded a cover of Radiohead's \\"Creep\\" which was subsequently used in an episode of Stalker. On July 17, 2015, Branch announced that she had signed with Verve Records.

Compared to a trot that is simply shortened, but not collected (bottom). Collection occurs when a horse's center of gravity is shifted backwards. Energy is directed in a more horizontal trajectory with less forward movement (limbs generate higher vertical impulses). Biomechanical markers include: increased flexion in the lumbo-sacral joint, stifle, and hocks of the horse; increased engagement of the thoracic sling muscles resulting in the withers rising relative to the horse's scapula; and reduced ranges of limb protraction–retraction. Collection in riding Collection in the trot, with more weight carried on the hindquarters. Trotting with a shortened stride \\"on the forehand,\\" rather than collected. Collection is also an important ingredient in riding, if the rider wishes to perform more advanced movements or jumping. It not only allows the horse to move more easily and athletically, but also helps prevent wear-and-tear on the front legs. Through training, the horse learns to collect itself when requested to do so by the rider. The observer receives the impression of great strength held under perfect control. The most readily apparent form of collection can be observed when comparing different degrees of collection within a single gait. A more collected gait will have two main symptoms: the horse will lower his hindquarters and raise his forehand, and the horse will have more bend in the joints of his legs. Additionally, the stride length will be shortened. Collection may be performed at any gait. However, this does not mean that any shortened gait is collected. Riders who try to pull their horses into a shortened gait (riding \\"front-to-back\\"), rather than contain the energy coming from the hindquarters (riding \\"back-to-front\\"), will produce a shortened stride, but the horse will continue to carry his weight on his front end, and will simply have stiff, unathletic movement. The shoulders will not be raised, and the horse will find it more difficult to perform a task than he would otherwise. The hind legs will usually be \\"strung out behind,\\" rather than coming up under the body with each stride to support it, and the back will be dropped rather than properly raised upward. Specific uses in sport Collected gaits are asked for in dressage tests from the mid-levels upward, at the walk, trot, and canter. Additionally, a high degree of collection is required of the rider in more advanced dressage moves, such as the pirouette, piaffe, and passage. The ultimate level of collection is the levade, in which the horse carries 100% of his weight on his hindquarters. Unlike a rearing horse, the horse's rear legs are well under it, and it can safely support itself in an upright position for a time and then lower itself to the ground under control. Collection is also essential in jumping. Most horses will physically be unable to jump extremely high fences (such as those seen in Grand Prix show jumping or puissance classes) without collection, as they will not have enough power to make it over the obstacle. Speed is not a substitute, and a horse that is simply galloped at a fence will find it extremely difficult to raise his forehand upward on takeoff and gain enough height over the fence. Instead, he will jump flat, without bascule, and will be much more likely to pull a rail. Secondly, horses must be adjustable within jumping courses, having the ability to shorten or lengthen their stride between obstacles, especially if placed in a combination. A horse that is not collected will find it very hard to seamlessly shorten his stride in a related distance, and may be forced to take off too close or too far away from the jump, which greatly increases the chance he will hit it. Collection also makes it easier for a horse to make sudden changes of direction, such as those required by western performance horses. Cutting horses are excellent examples, as they crouch low and back on their hindquarters so they may quickly move side to side to mirror the movements of the calf.

Abnormal growths found in the bone can be either benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Average five-year survival in the United States after being diagnosed with bone and joint cancer is 67%. Symptoms The most common symptom of bone tumors is pain, which will gradually increase over time. A person may go weeks, months, and sometimes years before seeking help; the pain increases with the growth of the tumor. Additional symptoms may include fatigue, fever, weight loss, anemia, nausea, and unexplained bone fractures. Many patients will not experience any symptoms, except for a painless mass. Some bone tumors may weaken the structure of the bone, causing pathologic fractures. Types X-ray of a giant cell bone tumor in the head of the 4th metacarpal of the left hand. An arm bone tumor Bone tumors may be classified as \\"primary tumors\\", which originate in bone or from bone-derived cells and tissues, and \\"secondary tumors\\" which originate in other sites and spread (metastasize) to the skeleton. Carcinomas of the prostate, breasts, lungs, thyroid, and kidneys are the carcinomas that most commonly metastasize to bone. Secondary malignant bone tumors are estimated to be 50 to 100 times as common as primary bone cancers. Primary bone tumors Primary tumors of bone can be divided into benign tumors and cancers. Common benign bone tumors may be neoplastic, developmental, traumatic, infectious, or inflammatory in etiology. Some benign tumors are not true neoplasms, but rather, represent hamartomas, namely the osteochondroma. The most common locations for many primary tumors, both benign and malignant include the distal femur and proximal tibia (around the knee joint). Examples of benign bone tumors include osteoma, osteoid osteoma, osteochondroma, osteoblastoma, enchondroma, giant cell tumor of bone and aneurysmal bone cyst. Malignant primary bone tumors include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and other types. While malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) - now generally called \\"pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma\\" - primary in bone is known to occur occasionally,Jeon DG, Song WS, Kong CB, Kim JR, Lee SY. MFH of Bone and Osteosarcoma Show Similar Survival and Chemosensitivity. Clin Orthop Rel Res 469;584-90. current paradigms tend to consider MFH a \\"wastebasket\\" diagnosis, and the current trend is toward using specialized studies (i.e. genetic and immunohistochemical tests) to classify these undifferentiated tumors into other tumor classes. Multiple myeloma is a hematologic cancer, originating in the bone marrow, which also frequently presents as one or more bone lesions. Germ cell tumors, including teratoma, often present and originate in the midline of the sacrum, coccyx, or both. These sacrococcygeal teratomas are often relatively amenable to treatment. Secondary bone tumors Secondary bone tumors are metastatic lesions which have spread from other organs, most commonly carcinomas of the breast, lung, and prostate. Rarely, primary bone malignancies such as osteosarcoma may also spread to other bones. Reliable and valid statistics on the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of malignant bone tumors are difficult to come by, particularly in the oldest (those over 75 years of age) - because carcinomas that are widely metastatic to bone are rarely ever curable, biopsies to determine the origin of the tumor in cases like this are rarely done. Diagnosis Projectional radiography (\\"X-ray\\") is the optimal initial imaging modality for evaluating undiagnosed primary bone tumors. CT scan, MRI and/or histopathology can aid in reaching a final diagnosis, as well as staging thereof. Staging File:Diagram showing stage 1A bone cancer CRUK 198.svgStage 1A bone cancer File:Diagram showing stage 1B bone cancer CRUK 201.svgStage 1B bone cancer File:Diagram showing stage 2A bone cancer CRUK 211.svgStage 2A bone cancer File:Diagram showing stage 2B bone cancer CRUK 215.svgStage 2B bone cancer File:Diagram showing stage 3 bone cancer CRUK 218.svgStage 3 bone cancer Treatment Treatment of bone tumors is highly dependent on the type of tumor. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective in some tumors (such as Ewing's sarcoma) but less so in others (such as chondrosarcoma).Bone tumor at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York There is a variety of chemotherapy treatment protocols for bone tumors. The protocol with the best-reported survival in children and adults is an intra-arterial protocol where tumor response is tracked by serial arteriogram. When tumor response has reached >90% necrosis surgical intervention is planned.10 year survival in Pediatric OsteosarcomaSurvival in Adult Osteosarcoma and MFH of Bone Medication One of the major concerns is bone density and bone loss. Non-hormonal bisphosphonates increase bone strength and are available as once-a-week prescription pills. Metastron also known as strontium-89 chloride is an intravenous medication given to help with the pain and can be given in three- month intervals. Generic Strontium Chloride Sr-89 Injection UPS, manufactured by Bio-Nucleonics Inc., it is the generic version of Metastron. Surgical treatment Treatment for some bone cancers may involve surgery, such as limb amputation, or limb sparing surgery (often in combination with chemotherapy and radiation therapy). Limb sparing surgery, or limb salvage surgery, means the limb is spared from amputation. Instead of amputation, the affected bone is removed and replaced in one of two ways: (a) bone graft, in which bone is taken from elsewhere on the body or (b) artificial bone is put in. In upper leg surgeries, limb salvage prostheses are available.  Types of amputation  ;Leg * Below knee * Above knee * Symes * Hip disarticulation * Hemipelvectomy or hindquarter, in which the whole leg is removed with one half of the pelvis ;Arm * Below elbow * Above elbow * Shoulder disarticulation * Forequarter (amputation of the whole arm, along with the shoulder blade and the clavicle) The most radical of amputations is hemicorporectomy (translumbar or waist amputation) which removes the legs, the pelvis, urinary system, excretory system and the genital area (penis/testes in males and vagina/vulva in females). This operation is done in two stages. First stage is doing the colostomy and the urinary conduit, the second stage is the amputation. This is a mutilating operation and is only done as a last resort (e.g. when even pelvic exenteration does not work or in cases of advanced pelvic/reproductive cancers). Another type of surgery is called Van Nes rotation or rotationplasty which is a form of amputation, in which the patient's foot is turned upwards in a 180-degree turn and the upturned foot is used as a knee. There are other joint preservation surgical reconstruction options, which including allograft, tumor-devitalized autograft, vascularized fibula graft, distraction osteogenesis, and custom-made implants. An analysis of massive knee replacements after resection of primary bone tumours showed patients did not score as highly on the Musculoskeletal Tumour Society Score and Knee Society Score as patients who had undergone intra-articular resection.  Thermal ablation techniques  Over the past two decades, CT guided radiofrequency ablation has emerged as a less invasive alternative to surgical resection in the care of benign bone tumors, most notably osteoid osteomas. In this technique, which can be performed under conscious sedation, a RF probe is introduced into the tumor nidus through a cannulated needle under CT guidance and heat is applied locally to destroy tumor cells. Since the procedure was first introduced for the treatment of osteoid osteomas in the early 1990s, it has been shown in numerous studies to be less invasive and expensive, to result in less bone destruction and to have equivalent safety and efficacy to surgical techniques, with 66 to 96% of patients reporting freedom from symptoms. While initial success rates with RFA are high, symptom recurrence after RFA treatment has been reported, with some studies demonstrating a recurrence rate similar to that of surgical treatment. Thermal ablation techniques are also increasingly being used in the palliative treatment of painful metastatic bone disease. Currently, external beam radiation therapy is the standard of care for patients with localized bone pain due to metastatic disease. Although the majority of patients experience complete or partial relief of pain following radiation therapy, the effect is not immediate and has been shown in some studies to be transient in more than half of patients. For patients who are not eligible or do not respond to traditional therapies ( i.e. radiation therapy, chemotherapy, palliative surgery, bisphosphonates or analgesic medications), thermal ablation techniques have been explored as alternatives for pain reduction. Several multi-center clinical trials studying the efficacy of RFA in the treatment of moderate to severe pain in patients with metastatic bone disease have shown significant decreases in patient reported pain after treatment. These studies are limited however to patients with one or two metastatic sites; pain from multiple tumors can be difficult to localize for directed therapy. More recently, cryoablation has also been explored as a potentially effective alternative as the area of destruction created by this technique can be monitored more effectively by CT than RFA, a potential advantage when treating tumors adjacent to critical structures. Prognosis The outlook depends on the type of tumor. The outcome is expected to be good for people with noncancerous (benign) tumors, although some types of benign tumors may eventually become cancerous (malignant). With malignant bone tumors that have not spread, most patients achieve a cure, but the cure rate depends on the type of cancer, location, size, and other factors.

Specifically, it is an aggressive malignant neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces malignant osteoid. Osteosarcoma is the most common histological form of primary bone sarcoma. It is most prevalent in teenagers and young adults. Signs and symptoms Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night, may be intermittent and of varying intensity and may have been occurring for some time. Teenagers who are active in sports often complain of pain in the lower femur, or immediately below the knee. If the tumor is large, it can present as overt localised swelling. Sometimes a sudden fracture is the first symptom, because the affected bone is not as strong as normal bone and may fracture abnormally with minor trauma. In cases of more deep-seated tumors that are not as close to the skin, such as those originating in the pelvis, localised swelling may not be apparent. Causes Several research groups are investigating cancer stem cells and their potential to cause tumors along with genes and proteins causative in different phenotypes. Radiotherapy for unrelated conditions may be a rare cause. * Familial cases where the deletion of chromosome 13q14 inactivates the retinoblastoma gene is associated with a high risk of osteosarcoma development. * Bone dysplasias, including Paget's disease of bone, fibrous dysplasia, enchondromatosis, and hereditary multiple exostoses, increase the risk of osteosarcoma. * Li–Fraumeni syndrome (germline TP53 mutation) is a predisposing factor for osteosarcoma development. * Rothmund–Thomson syndrome (i.e. autosomal recessive association of congenital bone defects, hair and skin dysplasias, hypogonadism, and cataracts) is associated with increased risk of this disease. * Large doses of Sr-90 emission from nuclear reactors, nicknamed bone seeker increases the risk of bone cancer and leukemia in animals, and is presumed to do so in people. There is no clear association between water fluoridation and cancer or deaths due to cancer, both for cancer in general and also specifically for bone cancer and osteosarcoma. Series of research concluded that concentration of fluoride in water doesn't associate with osteosarcoma. The beliefs regarding association of fluoride exposure and osteosarcoma stem from a study of US National Toxicology program in 1990, which showed uncertain evidence of association of fluoride and osteosarcoma in male rats. But there is still no solid evidence of cancer-causing tendency of fluoride in mice.\\"Water Fluoridation and Cancer Risk\\", American Cancer Society, 6 June 2013. Fluoridation of water has been practiced around the world to improve citizens' dental health. It is also deemed as major health success.\\"Cancer myth: Fluoride and cancer\\", Cancer Council Western Australia. Fluoride concentration levels in water supplies are regulated, such as United States Environmental Protection Agency regulates fluoride levels to not be greater than 4 milligrams per liter.\\"Basic Information about Fluoride in Drinking Water\\", United States Environmental Protection Agency. Actually, water supplies already have natural occurring fluoride, but many communities chose to add more fluoride to the point that it can reduce tooth decay.\\"Community Water Fluoridation\\", Centers of disease control and prevention. Fluoride is also known for its ability to cause new bone formation.\\"Fluoride\\", Australian government national health and medical research council. Yet, further research shows no osteosarcoma risks from fluoridated water in humans.\\"Fluoridated Water\\", National Cancer Institute. Most of the research involved counting number of osteosarcoma patients cases in particular areas which has difference concentrations of fluoride in drinking water. The statistic analysis of the data shows no significant difference in occurrences of osteosarcoma cases in different fluoridated regions. Another important research involved collecting bone samples from osteosarcoma patients to measure fluoride concentration and compare them to bone samples of newly diagnosed malignant bone tumors. The result is that the median fluoride concentrations in bone samples of osteosarcoma patients and tumor controls are not significantly different. Not only fluoride concentration in bones, Fluoride exposures of osteosarcoma patients are also proven to be not significantly different from healthy people.  Mechanism  Predilections of osteosarcoma Osteosarcomas tend to occur at the sites of bone growth, presumably because proliferation makes osteoblastic cells in this region prone to acquire mutations that could lead to transformation of cells (the RB gene and p53 gene are commonly involved). Due to this tendency, high incidence of osteosarcoma is seen in some large dog breeds (St. Bernards and Great Danes). The tumor may be localized at the end of the long bone (commonly in the metaphysis). Most often it affects the proximal end of tibia or humerus, or distal end of femur. Osteosarcoma tends to affect regions around the knee in 60% of cases, 15% around the hip, 10% at the shoulder, and 8% in the jaw. The tumor is solid, hard, irregular (\\"fir-tree,\\" \\"moth-eaten\\", or \\"sun-burst\\" appearance on X-ray examination) due to the tumor spicules of calcified bone radiating in right angles. These right angles form what is known as a Codman triangle, which is characteristic but not diagnostic of osteosarcoma. Surrounding tissues are infiltrated. High-magnification micrograph showing osteoid formation in an osteosarcoma H&E; stain Microscopically: The characteristic feature of osteosarcoma is presence of osteoid (bone formation) within the tumor. Tumor cells are very pleomorphic (anaplastic), some are giant, numerous atypical mitoses. These cells produce osteoid describing irregular trabeculae (amorphous, eosinophilic/pink) with or without central calcification (hematoxylinophilic/blue, granular)—tumor bone. Tumor cells are included in the osteoid matrix. Depending on the features of the tumor cells present (whether they resemble bone cells, cartilage cells, or fibroblast cells), the tumor can be subclassified. Osteosarcomas may exhibit multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells. Diagnosis Family physicians and orthopedists rarely see a malignant bone tumor (most bone tumors are benign). The route to osteosarcoma diagnosis usually begins with an X-ray, continues with a combination of scans (CT scan, PET scan, bone scan, MRI) and ends with a surgical biopsy. A characteristic often seen in an X-ray is Codman's triangle, which is basically a subperiosteal lesion formed when the periosteum is raised due to the tumor. Films are suggestive, but bone biopsy is the only definitive method to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign. Most times, the early signs of osteosarcoma are caught on X-rays taken during routine dental check-ups. Osteosarcoma frequently develops in the mandible (lower jaw); accordingly, Dentists are trained to look for signs that may suggest osteosarcoma. Even though radiographic findings for this cancer vary greatly, one usually sees a symmetrical widening of the periodontal ligament space. If the dentist has reason to suspects osteosarcoma or another underlying disorder, he or she would refer the patient to an Oral & Maxillofacial surgeon for biopsy. A biopsy of suspected osteosarcoma outside of the facial region should be performed by a qualified orthopedic oncologist. The American Cancer Society states: \\"Probably in no other cancer is it as important to perform this procedure properly. An improperly performed biopsy may make it difficult to save the affected limb from amputation.\\" It may also metastasise to the lungs, mainly appearing on the chest X-ray as solitary or multiple round nodules most common at the lower regions. Variants * Conventional: osteoblastic, chondroblastic, fibroblastic OS * Telangiectatic OS * Small cell OS * Low-grade central OS * Periosteal OS * Paraosteal OS * Secondary OS * High-grade surface OS * Extraskeletal OS WHO Treatment A complete radical, surgical, en bloc resection of the cancer, is the treatment of choice in osteosarcoma. Although about 90% of patients are able to have limb-salvage surgery, complications, particularly infection, prosthetic loosening and non-union, or local tumor recurrence may cause the need for further surgery or amputation. Mifamurtide is used after a patient has had surgery to remove the tumor and together with chemotherapy to kill remaining cancer cells to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Also, the option to have rotationplasty after the tumor is taken out exists.Luke's Story: Surviving Osteosarcoma, Children's Cancer Research Fund. Accessed 2016-11-07. Patients with osteosarcoma are best managed by a medical oncologist and an orthopedic oncologist experienced in managing sarcomas. Current standard treatment is to use neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given before surgery) followed by surgical resection. The percentage of tumor cell necrosis (cell death) seen in the tumor after surgery gives an idea of the prognosis and also lets the oncologist know if the chemotherapy regimen should be altered after surgery. Standard therapy is a combination of limb-salvage orthopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-arterial cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide with mesna, BCD (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin), etoposide, and muramyl tripeptide.Sameer Rastogi, Aditi Aggarwal, Akash Tiwari et al. Chemotherapy in Nonmetastatic Osteosarcoma: Recent Advances and Implications for Developing Countries. https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JGO.2016.007336 Rotationplasty may be used. Ifosfamide can be used as an adjuvant treatment if the necrosis rate is low. Despite the success of chemotherapy for osteosarcoma, it has one of the lowest survival rates for pediatric cancer. The best reported 10-year survival rate is 92%; the protocol used is an aggressive intra-arterial regimen that individualizes therapy based on arteriographic response. Three-year event-free survival ranges from 50% to 75%, and five-year survival ranges from 60% to 85+% in some studies. Overall, 65–70% patients treated five years ago will be alive today. These survival rates are overall averages and vary greatly depending on the individual necrosis rate. Filgrastim or pegfilgrastim help with white blood cell counts and neutrophil counts. Blood transfusions and epoetin alfa help with anemia. Computational analysis on a panel of Osteosarcoma cell lines identified new shared and specific therapeutic targets (proteomic and genetic) in Osteosarcoma, while phenotypes showed an increased role of tumor microenvironments. Prognosis Prognosis is separated into three groups. * Stage I osteosarcoma is rare and includes parosteal osteosarcoma or low-grade central osteosarcoma. It has an excellent prognosis (>90%) with wide resection. * Stage II prognosis depends on the site of the tumor (proximal tibia, femur, pelvis, etc.), size of the tumor mass, and the degree of necrosis from neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Other pathological factors such as the degree of p-glycoprotein, whether the tumor is cxcr4-positive, or Her2-positive are also important, as these are associated with distant metastases to the lung. The prognosis for patients with metastatic osteosarcoma improves with longer times to metastases (more than 12 months to 4 months), a smaller number of metastases, and their resectability. It is better to have fewer metastases than longer time to metastases. Those with a longer length of time (more than 24 months) and few nodules (two or fewer) have the best prognosis, with a two-year survival after the metastases of 50%, five-year of 40%, and 10-year of 20%. If metastases are both local and regional, the prognosis is worse. * Initial presentation of stage III osteosarcoma with lung metastases depends on the resectability of the primary tumor and lung nodules, degree of necrosis of the primary tumor, and maybe the number of metastases. Overall survival prognosis is about 30%. Deaths due to malignant neoplasms of the bones and joints account for an unknown number of childhood cancer deaths. Mortality rates due to osteosarcoma have been declining at about 1.3% per year. Long-term survival probabilities for osteosarcoma have improved dramatically during the late 20th century and approximated 68% in 2009. Epidemiology Osteosarcoma is the eighth-most common form of childhood cancer, comprising 2.4% of all malignancies in pediatric patients, and about 20% of all primary bone cancers. Incidence rates for osteosarcoma in U.S. patients under 20 years of age are estimated at 5.0 per million per year in the general population, with a slight variation between individuals of black, Hispanic, and white ethnicities (6.8, 6.5, and 4.6 per million per year, respectively). It is slightly more common in males (5.4 per million per year) than in females (4.0 per million per year). It originates more frequently in the metaphyseal region of tubular long bones, with 42% occurring in the femur, 19% in the tibia, and 10% in the humerus. About 8% of all cases occur in the skull and jaw, and another 8% in the pelvis. Around 300 of the 900 people diagnosed in the United States will die each year. A second peak in incidence occurs in the elderly, usually associated with an underlying bone pathology such as Paget's disease of bone. Other animals X-ray of osteosarcoma of the distal femur in a dog Risk factors Osteosarcoma is the most common bone tumor in dogs and typically afflicts middle-aged large and giant breed dogs such as Irish Wolfhounds, Greyhounds, German Shepherds, Rottweilers, mountain breeds (Great Pyrenees, St. Bernard, Leonberger, Newfoundland), Doberman Pinschers and Great Danes. It has a 10-fold greater incidence in dogs than humans. A hereditary base has been shown in St. Bernard dogs. Spayed/neutered dogs have twice the risk of intact ones to develop osteosarcoma. Infestation with the parasite Spirocerca lupi can cause osteosarcoma of the esophagus. Clinical presentation The most commonly affected bones are the proximal humerus, the distal radius, the distal femur, and the tibia, following the basic premise \\"far from the elbow, close to the knee\\". Other sites include the ribs, the mandible, the spine, and the pelvis. Rarely, osteosarcoma may arise from soft tissues (extraskeletal osteosarcoma). Metastasis of tumors involving the limb bones is very common, usually to the lungs. The tumor causes a great deal of pain, and can even lead to fracture of the affected bone. As with human osteosarcoma, bone biopsy is the definitive method to reach a final diagnosis. Osteosarcoma should be differentiated from other bone tumours and a range of other lesions, such as osteomyelitis. Differential diagnosis of the osteosarcoma of the skull in particular includes, among others, chondrosarcoma and the multilobular tumour of bone. Treatment and prognosis Amputation is the initial treatment, although this alone will not prevent metastasis. Chemotherapy combined with amputation improves the survival time, but most dogs still die within a year. Surgical techniques designed to save the leg (limb-sparing procedures) do not improve the prognosis. Some current studies indicate osteoclast inhibitors such as alendronate and pamidronate may have beneficial effects on the quality of life by reducing osteolysis, thus reducing the degree of pain, as well as the risk of pathological fractures. Cats Osteosarcoma is also the most common bone tumor in cats, although not as frequently encountered, and most typically affects the rear legs. The cancer is generally less aggressive in cats than in dogs, so amputation alone can lead to a significant survival time in many affected cats, though post-amputation chemotherapy is recommended when a high grade is confirmed on histopathology.

The patella is found in many tetrapods, such as mice, cats and birds, but not in whales, or most reptiles. In humans, the patella is the largest sesamoid bone in the body. Babies are born with a patella of soft cartilage which begins to ossify into bone at about four years of age.  Structure  The patella is a sesamoid bone roughly triangular in shape, with the apex of the patella facing downwards. The apex is the most inferior (lowest) part of the patella. It is pointed in shape, and gives attachment to the patellar ligament. The front and back surfaces are joined by a thin margin and towards centre by a thicker margin. The tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle attaches to the base of the patella., with the vastus intermedius muscle attaching to the base itself, and the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis are attached to outer lateral and medial borders of patella respectively. The upper third of the front of the patella is coarse, flattened, and rough, and serves for the attachment of the tendon of the quadriceps and often has exostoses. The middle third has numerous vascular canaliculi. The lower third culminates in the apex which serves as the origin of the patellar ligament. The posterior surface is divided into two parts. Patella ant.jpgHuman left patella from the front Patella post.jpgHuman left patella from behind Knee Biomechanics.JPGFlexion and extension of knee The upper three-quarters of the patella articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape. In the adult the articular surface is about and covered by cartilage, which can reach a maximal thickness of in the centre at about 30 years of age. Owing to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee flexion, the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body. The lower part of the posterior surface has vascular canaliculi filled and is filled by fatty tissue, the infrapatellar fat pad. Variation In this X-ray, an anatomical variation of the patella can be seen – the bipartate patella, in which the patella is split into two parts. Emarginations (i.e. patella emarginata, a \\"missing piece\\") are common laterally on the proximal edge. Bipartite patellas are the result of an ossification of a second cartilaginous layer at the location of an emargination. Previously, bipartite patellas were explained as the failure of several ossification centres to fuse, but this idea has been rejected. Partite patellas occur almost exclusively in men. Tripartite and even multipartite patellas occur. The upper three-quarters of the patella articulates with the femur and is subdivided into a medial and a lateral facet by a vertical ledge which varies in shape. Four main types of articular surface can be distinguished: # Most commonly the medial articular surface is smaller than the lateral. # Sometimes both articular surfaces are virtually equal in size. # Occasionally, the medial surface is hypoplastic or # the central ledge is only indicated.  Development In the patella an ossification centre develops at the age of 3–6 years. The patella originates from two centres of ossification which unite when fully formed.  Function  The primary functional role of the patella is knee extension. The patella increases the leverage that the quadriceps tendon can exert on the femur by increasing the angle at which it acts. The patella is attached to the tendon of the quadriceps femoris muscle, which contracts to extend/straighten the knee. The patella is stabilized by the insertion of the horizontal fibres of vastus medialis and by the prominence of the lateral femoral condyle, which discourages lateral dislocation during flexion. The retinacular fibres of the patella also stabilize it during exercise. Clinical significance Dislocation Patellar dislocations occur with significant regularity, particularly in young female athletes. It involves the patella sliding out of its position on the knee, most often laterally, and may be associated with extremely intense pain and swelling. The patella can be tracked back into the groove with an extension of the knee, and therefore sometimes returns into the proper position on its own. Vertical alignment Patella baja. (CC-BY-3.0) A patella alta is a high-riding (superiorly aligned) patella. An attenuated patella alta is an unusually small patella that develops out of and above the joint. A patella baja is a low-riding patella. A long-standing patella baja may result in extensor dysfunction. Insall-Salvati ratio (A divided by B). The Insall-Salvati ratio helps to indicate patella baja on lateral X-rays, and is calculated as the patellar tendon length divided by the patellar bone length. An Insall-Salvati ratio of < 0.8 indicates patella baja. Fracture The kneecap is prone to injury because of its particularly exposed location, and fractures of the patella commonly occur as a consequence of direct trauma onto the knee. These fractures usually cause swelling and pain in the region, bleeding into the joint (hemarthrosis), and an inability to extend the knee. Patella fractures are usually treated with surgery, unless the damage is minimal and the extensor mechanism is intact. Exostosis An exostosis is the formation of new bone onto a bone, as a result of excess calcium formation. This can be the cause of chronic pain when formed on the patella. Other animals The patella is found in placental mammals and birds; most marsupials have only rudimentary, non-ossified patellae although a few species possess a bony patella. A patella is also present in the living monotremes, the platypus and the echidna. In more primitive tetrapods, including living amphibians and most reptiles (except some Lepidosaurs), the muscle tendons from the upper leg are attached directly to the tibia, and a patella is not present. In 2017 it was discovered that frogs have kneecaps, contrary to what was thought. This raises the possibility that the kneecap arose 400 million years ago when tetrapods first appeared, but that it disappeared in some animals. Etymology The word patella originated in the late 17th century from the diminutive form of Latin ' or ' or paten, meaning shallow dish.New Shorter Oxford See also * Patellar reflex * Knee pain * Osteoarthritis * Lateral retinaculum * Lateral release References External links Category:Knee Category:Sesamoid bones Category:Bones of the lower limb ","title":"Patella"},{"id":"309895","text":"Gregory VII may refer to: *Pope Gregory VII (c. 1015–1085) *Catholicos Gregory VII of Cilicia (r. 1293–1307) *Patriarch Gregory VII of Constantinople (r. 1923–1924) ","title":"Gregory VII"},{"id":"309898","text":"Location of Slope Point Slope Point is the southernmost point of the South Island of New Zealand.

He successfully defended the title 16 times. Cervantes fought 21 world title fights, keeping the 140 pounds title for almost 8 years. Cervantes, who is Afro-Colombian, was born in Palenque, also known as the first site of a slave rebellion in the Americas. Cervantes used to sell contraband cigarettes and shine shoes as a child to survive. In 2002, Cervantes was chosen for the Ring Magazine's list of 80 Best Fighters of the Last 80 Years. Boxrec also ranked him the 50th greatest pound for pound boxer of all time.Boxrec all time p4p rankings Boxing career He met boxing trainer Carmelo Prada, who helped shape his style. Cervantes only had three amateur bouts, winning two and losing one. On January 31, 1964, Cervantes entered the boxing ring as a professional for the first time, beating Juan Martínez by decision in six rounds. His first 32 bouts as a professional were in Colombia, and he won 27, lost 4 and drew one of them. Realizing his pupil needed publicity outside Colombia, Prada then moved with Cervantes to Venezuela, where, on November 25, 1968, he knocked out Orlando Ruiz in the first round for his first fight abroad. He followed that win with a ten rounds decision over Nestor Rojas in the very short time of only three days later. On December 23 of that year, he suffered his first knockout defeat when Cruz Marcano, a fringe contender of the time, beat him in four rounds in Caracas. He won five and lost two in 1969, splitting his fights between Colombia and Venezuela, and losing a ten- round decision to Antonio Gomez, former world champion. He won two more in 1970, then he and Prada moved, this time to Los Angeles. In California, he began by beating Jose Rodriguez by a knockout in the first round in San Jose, and on December 17, he beat Rodolfo Gato González, a very famous Mexican boxer of the time, by knockout in round eight. After this and a 1971 win over Argentine Enrique Jana, Cervantes was ranked as a Jr. Welterweight by the WBA. On December 11 of that year, he had his first world title try, against Nicolino Locche, in Buenos Aires. Cervantes lost a 15-round decision that time, however. Winning the world light welterweight title After winning three fights in 1972, Cervantes, who had by then returned to Colombia, had another world title try: Alfonso 'Peppermint' Frazer, who had dethroned Locche of the world title, gave Cervantes a chance on October 28 at Panama City. Cervantes knocked Frazer out in round ten and became the world light welterweight champion for the first time. Cervantes immediately became a national hero in Colombia, and many enterprises made him their spokesman in the coffee producing country, most notably Sanyo, whose name the popular champion advertised on his clothing and fight trunks. Cervantes made nine defenses, including a knockout in nine of Locche in a rematch, a knockout in five of Frazer, also in a rematch, a 15-round split decision win over Josue Marquez in Puerto Rico (in the first world title bout ever held at Roberto Clemente Coliseum; most of the nine thousand in attendance scored the fight for Cervantes) and a 15-round decision against future world Lightweight champion Esteban De Jesús. But on March 6, 1976, at San Juan, he lost a 15-round decision and the world title to 17-year-old Puerto Rican Wilfred Benítez, who with that became boxing's youngest champion ever.https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2230186-ranking-the-most-unbreakable- records-in-boxing#slide1 Cervantes won five more fights in a row, including a win over Saoul Mamby, before fighting for the world title again. After Benitez had left the Jr. welterweight belt vacant, Cervantes regained it on June 25, 1977, with a five-round knockout over Carlos Maria Gimenez, again in Venezuela. His second reign as world champion took him to such places as Thailand, Botswana and South Korea, among others. He retained the title six times, beating the likes of Adrian Marrero and Miguel Montilla (twice). By this time, there was much talk about a superfight with world Lightweight champion Roberto Durán, who was coming up in weight. Duran decided to challenge Sugar Ray Leonard instead, however, and Cervantes vs. Duran never materialized. On August 2, 1980, Cervantes dropped his next title challenger, Aaron Pryor, to the canvas in the first round. Pryor recovered, however, and beat Cervantes by a knockout in round four. This turned out to be Cervantes' last world title fight. He fought two times more for the FECARBOX WBC title, winning both fights shortly before retiring in 1980. However, Cervantes came out of retirement due to financial problems and went on boxing until 1983, winning four fights and dropping his last one, a ten-round decision loss to Danny Sanchez on December 9, 1983, at Miami. Retirement In retirement, his life was almost as public as it was during his boxing career: In 1985, for example, he and a female passenger in one of the boats Cervantes owned, suffered a water accident, and the passenger almost drowned, but Cervantes was able to save her life. A movie has been made about a fictional boxer called Milton Ollivera (who comes from Colombia) who goes through a majority of the things Cervantes went through throughout his life. Cervantes was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1998, and in 2000, he was declared by the Colombian Boxing Federation and National Association of Professional Boxing as Colombia's Fighter of the Century. For that award, the WBA issued him a special, commemorative belt. Cervantes' nickname, Kid Pambelé, became almost as famous as Cervantes himself: as a matter of a fact, many fans called him only Pambelé or Pambe (the name of a song by Carlos Vives about him).

Despite being used for decades as the iconic duckbill dinosaur, the material it is based on is composed of teeth from both duckbills and ceratopsids (their teeth have a distinctive double rootHatcher, J.B., Marsh, O.C. and Lull, R.S. (1907). The Ceratopsia. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 300 pp. ), and its describer, Joseph Leidy, came to recognize the difference and suggested limiting the genus to what would now be seen as ceratopsid teeth. Restricted to the duckbill teeth, it may have been a lambeosaurine.Sternberg, C.M. (1936). The systematic position of Trachodon. Journal of Paleontology 10(7):652-655. History and classification In 1856, Joseph Leidy received fragmentary remains from the Judith River Formation, collected by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden. From these bones, he provided the first names for North American dinosaurs: Deinodon, Palaeoscincus, Trachodon, and Troodon (then spelled Troödon). The type species of Trachodon is T. mirabilis. The generic name is derived from Greek τραχυς, trakhys, \\"rough\\", and όδον, odon, \\"tooth\\", referring to the granulate inner surface of one of the teeth. The specific name means \\"marvelous\\" in Latin. Trachodon was based on ANSP 9260, seven unassociated teeth, one of which had double roots. With better remains from Hadrosaurus, he began to reconsider his taxonomy, and suggested, at least informally, that Trachodon should refer to the double-rooted tooth, and the other teeth should be referred to Hadrosaurus.Leidy, J. (1868). Remarks on a jaw fragment of Megalosaurus. Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Science Philadelphia 20:197-200. In the Bone Wars that followed, and their wake, the taxonomy of Trachodon and its relatives became increasingly confusing, with one author going so far as to sink all known hadrosaur species into Trachodon except for Claosaurus agilis,Hatcher, J.B. (1902). The genus and species of the Trachodontidae (Hadrosauridae, Claosauridae) Marsh. Annals of the Carnegie Museum 14(1):377-386. but as new material was described from the Rocky Mountain region, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, later authors began progressively restricting the reach of this genus.Gilmore, C.W. (1915). On the genus Trachodon. Science 41:658-660. By 1942, and the publication of the influential Lull-Wright monograph on duckbills, its holotype was regarded as \\"typical of all the genera of hadrosaurian dinosaur\\", except for the roughened margin that gave it its name, and that they regarded as due to the tooth having not been used (p. 149).Lull, R.S., and Wright, N.E. (1942). Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America. Geological Society of America Special Paper 40:1-242.

Goods hauled are mostly timber, grain, poultry, and marble products. The GNRR's subsidiary, the Blue Ridge Scenic Railway, also operates on this line north of Blue Ridge. Despite the name, it actually operates between north-central and northwest Georgia, from north-northwest metro Atlanta, and is a few counties away from northeast Georgia. Purchased from CSX, the line interconnects with the Western & Atlantic subdivision of CSX at Elizabeth Yard in Marietta at milepost 22.0 (), located from downtown Atlanta. GNRR tracks include a long rail siding along the east side of the triple CSX tracks, from just north of Kennesaw Avenue, over Tower Road, to just north of Loudermilk Drive, where it rejoins what becomes the main northbound CSX track. The main GNRR track splits from the GNRR siding at a rail switch just north of Tower Road, and parallels the other tracks to just before Marr Avenue, before a sharp turn to the east. Between Marr, Loudermilk, the GNRR siding, and GNRR mainline, there are two dead-end sidings extending north on the east side of the GNRR office, and one of those has another dead-end siding extending north on the west side of the office. Communities Woodstock Counties and communities served by the line are as follows, from north to south (major towns in bold): *Fannin: **Blue Ridge (new) *Gilmer: **Cherry Log (new) **Ellijay *Pickens: **Whitestone **Jasper **Tate *Cherokee: **Ball Ground **Keithsburg **Canton **Holly Springs **Lebanon **Woodstock *Cobb: **Noonday **Blackwells **Westoak **Elizabeth, within Marietta History The route has had several names since it was chartered in 1854: *Ellijay Railroad, changing name to *Marietta, Canton and Ellijay Railroad, changing name to *Marietta and North Georgia Railroad, changing name to *Atlanta, Knoxville and Northern Railroad, later purchased by *Louisville and Nashville Railroad, later sold to *CSX Transportation, then sold to GNRR. Commuter rail At least one proposal is also considering using the line for commuter rail on the lower part of the route, from Canton to Marietta, and possibly along the CSX main route down to Atlanta. Canton, Marietta, and Cobb County put together $40,000 for a study, a draft of which says that it would cost $97 million to upgrade the old rail tracks and add passenger train stations, train cars and locomotives. Another $1.8 million would be needed annually above the intake of fares. The line would be 22 miles or 35 kilometers long from Canton to Elizabeth, where riders could transfer to Cobb Community Transit buses. The draft study estimates about 300 people per day would initially ride if it were already in place (600 if it went to Atlanta), and about 1700 would ride in 20 years. The study urges local governments (Cobb and Cherokee counties, and the cities of Marietta, Woodstock, Holly Springs, and Canton) to preserve any areas where a right-of- way may be necessary, allow no new grade crossings of roads, and prevent land development too close to the line (so that new residents cannot complain about it, though it has been there since the 1890s). The corridor may be in addition to GRTA Xpress or even CCT buses on the parallel Interstate 575, which is scheduled open High-occupancy toll lanes in 2018.

Aristotle was a prolific writer whose works cover many subjects including physics, biology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, and government. Any school of thought that takes one of Aristotle's distinctive positions as its starting point can be considered \\"Aristotelian\\" in the widest sense. This means that different Aristotelian theories (e.g. in ethics or in ontology) may not have much in common as far as their actual content is concerned besides their shared reference to Aristotle. In Aristotle's time, philosophy included natural philosophy, which preceded the advent of modern science during the Scientific Revolution. The works of Aristotle were initially defended by the members of the Peripatetic school and later on by the Neoplatonists, who produced many commentaries on Aristotle's writings. In the Islamic Golden Age, Avicenna and Averroes translated the works of Aristotle into Arabic and under them, along with philosophers such as Al-Kindi and Al-Farabi, Aristotelianism became a major part of early Islamic philosophy. Moses Maimonides adopted Aristotelianism from the Islamic scholars and based his Guide for the Perplexed on it and that became the basis of Jewish scholastic philosophy. Although some of Aristotle's logical works were known to western Europe, it was not until the Latin translations of the 12th century that the works of Aristotle and his Arabic commentators became widely available. Scholars such as Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas interpreted and systematized Aristotle's works in accordance with Catholic theology. After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of teleology was transmitted through Wolff and Kant to Hegel, who applied it to history as a totality. Although this project was criticized by Trendelenburg and Brentano as non-Aristotelian, Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon Marx. Recent Aristotelian ethical and \\"practical\\" philosophy, such as that of Gadamer and McDowell, is often premissed upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy. From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political republicanism, which views the res publica, public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian. The most famous contemporary Aristotelian philosopher is Alasdair MacIntyre. Especially famous for helping to revive virtue ethics in his book After Virtue, MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices. History Ancient Greek The original followers of Aristotle were the members of the Peripatetic school. The most prominent members of the school after Aristotle were Theophrastus and Strato of Lampsacus, who both continued Aristotle's researches. During the Roman era the school concentrated on preserving and defending his work.Furley, David (2003), From Aristotle to Augustine: Routledge History of Philosophy, 2, Routledge The most important figure in this regard was Alexander of Aphrodisias who commentated on Aristotle's writings. With the rise of Neoplatonism in the 3rd century, Peripateticism as an independent philosophy came to an end, but the Neoplatonists sought to incorporate Aristotle's philosophy within their own system, and produced many commentaries on Aristotle. Byzantine Empire Byzantine Aristotelianism emerged in the Byzantine Empire in the form of Aristotelian paraphrase: adaptations in which Aristotle's text is rephrased, reorganized, and pruned, in order to make it more easily understood. This genre was allegedly invented by Themistius in the mid-4th century, revived by Michael Psellos in the mid-11th century, and further developed by Sophonias in the late 13th to early 14th centuries. Leo the Mathematician was appointed to the chair of philosophy at the Magnaura School in the mid-9th century to teach Aristotelian logic. The 11th and 12th centuries saw the emergence of twelfth-century Byzantine Aristotelianism. Before the 12th century, the whole Byzantine output of Aristotelian commentaries was focused on logic. However, the range of subjects covered by the Aristotelian commentaries produced in the two decades after 1118 is much greater due to the initiative of the princess Anna Comnena who commissioned a number of scholars to write commentaries on previously neglected works of Aristotle. Islamic world An medieval Arabic representation of Aristotle teaching a student. In the Abbasid Empire, many foreign works were translated into Arabic, large libraries were constructed, and scholars were welcomed. Under the caliphs Harun al-Rashid and his son Al- Ma'mun, the House of Wisdom in Baghdad flourished. Christian scholar Hunayn ibn Ishaq (809–873) was placed in charge of the translation work by the caliph. In his lifetime, Ishaq translated 116 writings, including works by Plato and Aristotle, into Syriac and Arabic.Opth: Azmi, Khurshid. \\"Hunain bin Ishaq on Ophthalmic Surgery.\\" Bulletin of the Indian Institute of History of Medicine 26 (1996): 69–74. Web. 29 Oct. 2009Lindberg, David C. The Beginnings of Western Science: Islamic Science. Chicago: The University of Chicago, 2007. Print. With the founding of House of Wisdom, the entire corpus of Aristotelian works that had been preserved (excluding the Eudemian Ethics, Magna Moralia and Politics) became available, along with its Greek commentators; this corpus laid a uniform foundation for Islamic Aristotelianism.Manfred Landfester, Hubert Cancik, Helmuth Schneider (eds.), Brill's New Pauly: Encyclopaedia of the Ancient World. Classical tradition, Volume 1, Brill, 2006, p. 273. Al- Kindi (801–873) was the first of the Muslim Peripatetic philosophers, and is known for his efforts to introduce Greek and Hellenistic philosophy to the Arab world.Klein-Frank, F. Al-Kindi. In Leaman, O & Nasr, H (2001). History of Islamic Philosophy. London: Routledge. p 165 He incorporated Aristotelian and Neoplatonist thought into an Islamic philosophical framework. This was an important factor in the introduction and popularization of Greek philosophy in the Muslim intellectual world.Felix Klein-Frank (2001) Al-Kindi, pages 166–167. In Oliver Leaman & Hossein Nasr. History of Islamic Philosophy. London: Routledge. The philosopher Al-Farabi (872–950) had great influence on science and philosophy for several centuries, and in his time was widely thought second only to Aristotle in knowledge (alluded to by his title of \\"the Second Teacher\\"). His work, aimed at synthesis of philosophy and Sufism, paved the way for the work of Avicenna (980–1037). Avicenna was one of the main interpreters of Aristotle. The school of thought he founded became known as Avicennism, which was built on ingredients and conceptual building blocks that are largely Aristotelian and Neoplatonist. At the western end of the Mediterranean Sea, during the reign of Al-Hakam II (961 to 976) in Córdoba, a massive translation effort was undertaken, and many books were translated into Arabic. Averroes (1126–1198), who spent much of his life in Cordoba and Seville, was especially distinguished as a commentator of Aristotle. He often wrote two or three different commentaries on the same work, and some 38 commentaries by Averroes on the works of Aristotle have been identified.Edward Grant, (1996), The foundations of modern science in the Middle Ages, page 30. Cambridge University Press Although his writings had only marginal impact in Islamic countries, his works would eventually have a huge impact in the Latin West, and would lead to the school of thought known as Averroism. Western Europe Vatican fresco The School of Athens Although some knowledge of Aristotle seems to have lingered on in the ecclesiastical centres of western Europe after the fall of the Roman empire, by the ninth century nearly all that was known of Aristotle consisted of Boethius's commentaries on the Organon, and a few abridgments made by Latin authors of the declining empire, Isidore of Seville and Martianus Capella.Auguste Schmolders, History of Arabian Philosophy in The eclectic magazine of foreign literature, science, and art, Volume 46. February 1859 From that time until the end of the eleventh century, little progress is apparent in Aristotelian knowledge. The renaissance of the 12th century saw a major search by European scholars for new learning. James of Venice, who probably spent some years in Constantinople, translated Aristotle's Posterior Analytics from Greek into Latin in the mid-twelfth century,L.D. Reynolds and Nigel G. Wilson, Scribes and Scholars, Oxford, 1974, p. 106. thus making the complete Aristotelian logical corpus, the Organon, available in Latin for the first time. Scholars travelled to areas of Europe that once had been under Muslim rule and still had substantial Arabic-speaking populations. From central Spain, which had returned to Christian rule in the eleventh century, scholars produced many of the Latin translations of the 12th century. The most productive of these translators was Gerard of Cremona,C. H. Haskins, Renaissance of the Twelfth Century, p. 287. \\"more of Arabic science passed into Western Europe at the hands of Gerard of Cremona than in any other way.\\" (c. 1114–1187), who translated 87 books,For a list of Gerard of Cremona's translations see: Edward Grant (1974) A Source Book in Medieval Science, (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Pr.), pp. 35–8 or Charles Burnett, \\"The Coherence of the Arabic-Latin Translation Program in Toledo in the Twelfth Century,\\" Science in Context, 14 (2001): at 249-288, at pp. 275–281. which included many of the works of Aristotle such as his Posterior Analytics, Physics, On the Heavens, On Generation and Corruption, and Meteorology. Michael Scot (c. 1175–1232) translated Averroes' commentaries on the scientific works of Aristotle. Aristotle's physical writings began to be discussed openly, and at a time when Aristotle's method was permeating all theology, these treatises were sufficient to cause his prohibition for heterodoxy in the Condemnations of 1210–1277. In the first of these, in Paris in 1210, it was stated that \\"neither the books of Aristotle on natural philosophy or their commentaries are to be read at Paris in public or secret, and this we forbid under penalty of excommunication.\\"Edward Grant, A Source Book in Medieval Science, page 42 (1974). Harvard University Press However, despite further attempts to restrict the teaching of Aristotle, by 1270 the ban on Aristotle's natural philosophy was ineffective.Rubenstein, Richard E. Aristotle's Children: How Christians, Muslims, and Jews Rediscovered Ancient Wisdom and Illuminated the Middle Ages, page 215 (2004). Houghton Mifflin Harcourt William of Moerbeke (c. 1215–1286) undertook a complete translation of the works of Aristotle or, for some portions, a revision of existing translations. He was the first translator of the Politics (c. 1260) from Greek into Latin. Many copies of Aristotle in Latin then in circulation were assumed to have been influenced by Averroes, who was suspected of being a source of philosophical and theological errors found in the earlier translations of Aristotle. Such claims were without merit, however, as the Alexandrian Aristotelianism of Averroes followed \\"the strict study of the text of Aristotle, which was introduced by Avicenna, [because] a large amount of traditional Neoplatonism was incorporated with the body of traditional Aristotelianism\\". Albertus Magnus (c. 1200–1280) was among the first medieval scholars to apply Aristotle's philosophy to Christian thought. He produced paraphrases of most of the works of Aristotle available to him. He digested, interpreted and systematized the whole of Aristotle's works, gleaned from the Latin translations and notes of the Arabian commentators, in accordance with Church doctrine. His efforts resulted in the formation of a Christian reception of Aristotle in the Western Europe. Magnus did not repudiate Plato. In that, he belonged to the dominant tradition of philosophy that preceded him, namely the \\"concordist tradition\\",Henricus Bate, Helmut Boese, Carlos Steel, On Platonic Philosophy, Leuven: Leuven University Press, 1990, p. xvi. which sought to harmonize Aristotle with Plato through interpretation (see for example Porphyry's On Plato and Aristotle Being Adherents of the Same School). Magnus famously wrote: Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), the pupil of Albertus Magnus, wrote a dozen commentaries on the works of Aristotle. Thomas was emphatically Aristotelian, he adopted Aristotle's analysis of physical objects, his view of place, time and motion, his proof of the prime mover, his cosmology, his account of sense perception and intellectual knowledge, and even parts of his moral philosophy. The philosophical school that arose as a legacy of the work of Thomas Aquinas was known as Thomism, and was especially influential among the Dominicans, and later, the Jesuits. Using Albert's and Thomas's commentaries, as well as Marsilius of Padua's Defensor pacis, 14th-century scholar Nicole Oresme translated Aristotle's moral works into French and wrote extensive comments on them. Modern era After retreating under criticism from modern natural philosophers, the distinctively Aristotelian idea of teleology was transmitted through Wolff and Kant to Hegel, who applied it to history as a totality. Although this project was criticized by Trendelenburg and Brentano as un- Aristotelian, Hegel's influence is now often said to be responsible for an important Aristotelian influence upon Marx.For example, George E. McCarthy (ed.), Marx and Aristotle: Nineteenth-Century German Social Theory and Classical Antiquity, Although many disagree Rowman & Littlefield, 1992. Postmodernists, in contrast, reject Aristotelianism's claim to reveal important theoretical truths.For example, Ted Sadler, Heidegger and Aristotle: The Question of Being, Athlone, 1996. In this, they follow Heidegger's critique of Aristotle as the greatest source of the entire tradition of Western philosophy. Contemporary Ethics Aristotelianism is understood by its proponents as critically developing Plato's theories.For contrasting examples of this, see Hans-Georg Gadamer, The Idea of the Good in Platonic-Aristotelian Philosophy (trans. P. Christopher Smith), Yale University Press, 1986, and Lloyd P. Gerson, Aristotle and Other Platonists, Cornell University Press, 2005. Recent Aristotelian ethical and 'practical' philosophy, such as that of Gadamer and McDowell, is often premised upon a rejection of Aristotelianism's traditional metaphysical or theoretical philosophy. From this viewpoint, the early modern tradition of political republicanism, which views the res publica, public sphere or state as constituted by its citizens' virtuous activity, can appear thoroughly Aristotelian. The contemporary Aristotelian philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre is specially famous for helping to revive virtue ethics in his book After Virtue. MacIntyre revises Aristotelianism with the argument that the highest temporal goods, which are internal to human beings, are actualized through participation in social practices. He opposes Aristotelianism to the managerial institutions of capitalism and its state, and to rival traditions—including the philosophies of Hume, Kant, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche—that reject its idea of essentially human goods and virtues and instead legitimize capitalism. Therefore, on MacIntyre's account, Aristotelianism is not identical with Western philosophy as a whole; rather, it is \\"the best theory so far, [including] the best theory so far about what makes a particular theory the best one.\\"Alasdair MacIntyre, 'An Interview with Giovanna Borradori', in Kelvin Knight (ed.), The MacIntyre Reader, Polity Press / University of Notre Dame Press, 1998, p. 264. Politically and socially, it has been characterized as a newly 'revolutionary Aristotelianism'. This may be contrasted with the more conventional, apolitical and effectively conservative uses of Aristotle by, for example, Gadamer and McDowell.Kelvin Knight, Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre, Polity Press, 2007. Other important contemporary Aristotelian theorists include Fred D. Miller, Jr.Fred D. Miller, Jr., Nature, Justice, and Rights in Aristotle's Politics, Oxford University Press, 1997. in politics and Rosalind Hursthouse in ethics.Rosalind Hursthouse, On Virtue Ethics, Oxford University Press, 1999. Ontology Neo-Aristotelianism in meta-ontology holds that the goal of ontology is to determine which entities are fundamental and how the non-fundamental entities depend on them. The concept of fundamentality is usually defined in terms of metaphysical grounding. Fundamental entities are different from non- fundamental entities because they are not grounded in other entities. For example, it is sometimes held that elementary particles are more fundamental than the macroscopic objects (like chairs and tables) they compose. This is a claim about the grounding-relation between microscopic and macroscopic objects. Theses ideas go back to Aristotle's thesis that entities from different ontological categories have different degrees of fundamentality. For example, substances have the highest degree of fundamentality because they exist in themselves. Properties, on the other hand, are less fundamental because they depend on substances for their existence. Jonathan Schaffer's priority monism is a recent form of neo-Aristotelian ontology. He holds that on the most fundamental level there exists only one thing: the world as a whole. This thesis doesn't deny our common-sense intuition that the distinct objects we encounter in our everyday affairs like cars or other people exist. It only denies that these objects have the most fundamental form of existence. Problem of universals The problem of universals is the problem of whether and in which way universals exist. Aristotelians and Platonists are in agreement that universals have actual, mind-independent existence. They therefore oppose the nominalist standpoint. Aristotelians disagree with Platonists about the mode of existence of universals. Platonists hold that universals exist in some form of \\"Platonic heaven\\" and therefore exist independently of their instances in the concrete spatiotemporal world. Aristotelians, on the other hand, deny the existence of universals outside the spatiotemporal world. This view is known as immanent realism. For example, the universal \\"red\\" only exist insofar as there are red objects in the concrete world. There would be no red-universal if there were no red objects. David Armstrong is a contemporary defender of Aristotelianism concerning the problem of universals. States of affairs are the basic building blocks of his ontology. States of affairs have particulars and universals as their constituents. Armstrong is an immanent realist in the sense that he holds that a universal exists only insofar as it is a constituent of at least one actual state of affairs. Universals without instances are not part of the world. Criticism Bertrand Russell criticizes Aristotle's logic on the following points:, Chapter XXII Aristotle's Logic # The Aristotelian system allows formal defects leading to \\"bad metaphysics\\". For example, the following syllogism is permitted: \\"All golden mountains are mountains, all golden mountains are golden, therefore some mountains are golden\\", which insinuates the existence of at least one golden mountain. Furthermore, according to Russell, a predicate of a predicate can be a predicate of the original subject, which blurs the distinction between names and predicates with disastrous consequences; for example, a class with only one member is erroneously identified with that one member, making it impossible to have a correct theory of the number one. # The syllogism is overvalued in comparison to other forms of deduction. For example, syllogisms are not employed in mathematics since they are less convenient. In addition, Russell ends his review of the Aristotelian logic with these words: > I conclude that the Aristotelian doctrines with which we have been concerned > in this chapter are wholly false, with the exception of the formal theory of > the syllogism, which is unimportant. Any person in the present day who > wishes to learn logic will be wasting his time if he reads Aristotle or any > of his disciples. Nonetheless, Aristotle's logical writings show great > ability, and would have been useful to mankind if they had appeared at a > time when intellectual originality was still active. Unfortunately, they > appeared at the very end of the creative period of Greek thought, and > therefore came to be accepted as authoritative. By the time that logical > originality revived, a reign of two thousand years had made Aristotle very > difficult to dethrone. Throughout modern times, practically every advance in > science, in logic, or in philosophy has had to be made in the teeth of the > opposition from Aristotle's disciples.

Hooters waitress in Singapore, 2008 A waiter in a U.S. pizzeria A waitress in a hotel, North Korea A Swedish waitress, 2012. Waiting staff (British English), waitstaff (North American English), waiters/waitresses , or servers (North American English) are those who work at a restaurant or a bar, and sometimes in private homes, attending to customers by supplying them with food and drink as requested. Waiting staff follow rules and guidelines determined by the manager. Waiting staff carry out many different tasks, such as taking orders, food-running, polishing dishes and silverware, helping bus tables, and restocking working stations with needed supplies. Waiting on tables is part of the service sector and among the most common occupations in the United States. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that, as of May 2008, there were over 2.2 million people employed as servers in the U.S. Many restaurants choose a specific uniform for their waiting staff to wear. Waiting staff may receive tips as a minor or major part of their earnings, with customs varying widely from country to country. Terminology An individual waiting tables (or waiting on or waiting at tables) or waitering or waitressing is commonly called a waiter, server, front server, waitress, member of the wait staff, waitstaff,\\"Waitstaff.\\" The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004, via dictionary.com website. Retrieved on 17 September 2007. serving staff server, waitperson, or waitron.\\"Waitron.\\" Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Random House, via dictionary.com website. Retrieved on 17 September 2007. The last two terms are gender neutral but rarely used, and the terms waiter and server are increasingly used for women too. Archaic terms such as serving girl, serving wench, or serving lad are generally used only within their historical context. Roles In large luxury establishments, there are often multiple ranks of waiting staff in the dining room:Pascale le Draoulec, \\"Who's who in the dining room\\", Los Angeles Times, October 24, 2007 * Maître d'hôtel, responsible for dining room as a whole, greets guests * Floor manager * Headwaiter * Expeditor, or \\"Expo\\", responsible for ensuring accuracy and completeness of orders. The expeditor is also often responsible for preparing the tray for the servers so they can bring all of the plates of that course to all of the table guests at the same time * Captain, responsible for several tables * Waiter * Front waiter * Back waiter, who helps waiters refill water, replenish bread, etc. * Bar back, who helps a bartender by bussing, and restocking glassware and alcohol * Runner, who brings cooked dishes to diners * Busboy, busser, clears tables, sets tables In such restaurants, the captain is typically responsible for interacting with the diners and overseeing waiters.Frank J. Prial, \\"Restaurant Tipping: The Captain, the Waiter, The Sommelier...\\", New York Times, March 12, 1979, p. B13 There are also specialists, notably a sommeliers for wine service, and occasionally a maître fromager for the cheese service. A host or hostess may be responsible for seating diners if there is not a maître d'hôtel. Duties Saganaki, lit on fire, served by waiters in Chicago The duties of waiting staff can be tedious and challenging but are vital to the success of the restaurant. Such duties include the following: preparing a section of tables before guests sit down (e.g., changing the tablecloth, putting out new utensils, cleaning chairs, etc.); offering cocktails, specialty drinks, wine, beer, or other beverages; recommending food options; requesting the chef to make changes in how food is prepared; pre-clearing the tables; and serving food and beverages to customers. In some higher-end restaurants, servers have a good knowledge of the wine list and can recommend food–wine pairings. At more expensive restaurants, servers memorize the ingredients of the dishes and the manner in which the food is prepared; for example, if the menu lists marinated beef, the customer might ask what the beef is marinated in, for how long, and what cut of beef is used in the dish. Silver service staff are specially trained to serve at banquets or high-end restaurants. These servers follow specific rules and service guidelines, which makes this a skilled job. They generally wear black and white with a long, white apron (extending from the waist to the ankles). At expensive restaurants, waiting staff also keep blacklists of rude customers. The head server is in charge of the waiting staff and is also frequently responsible for assigning seating. The head server must insure that all staff do their duties accordingly. The functions of a head server can overlap to some degree with that of the maître d'hôtel. Restaurants in North America employ an additional level of waiting staff, known as busboys or busgirls, increasingly referred to as bussers or server assistants, to clear dirty dishes, set tables, and otherwise assist the waiting staff.(2004.) \\"Busboy.\\" The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, Houghton Mifflin Company, via dictionary.com. Retrieved on 19 September 2007.\\"Busgirl.\\" Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1), Random House, Inc., via dictionary.com. Retrieved on 19 September 2007.Schmich, Mary. (24 August 2007.) \\"Uh, no offense, but do you still say 'busboy'?\\" Chicago Tribune Web Edition. Retrieved on 19 September 2007. Emotional labour is often required of waiting staff, particularly at many high-class restaurants. Requirements Restaurant serving positions require on-the-job training that would be held by an upper-level server in the restaurant. The server will be trained to provide good customer service, learn food items and drinks, and maintain a neat and tidy appearance. Working in a role such as captain in a top rated restaurant requires disciplined role- playing comparable to a theater performance. In the United States, some states require individuals employed to handle food and beverages to obtain a food handler's card or permit. In these States, servers that do not have a permit or handler's card can not serve. The server can achieve a permit or handler's card online. No food certification requirements are needed in Canada. However, to serve alcoholic beverages in Canada, servers must undergo their province's online training course within a month of being hired. Job benefits Waiting offers flexible work schedules and the ability to work on a part-time basis. This makes the profession appealing to students, parents with childcare commitments, and people who also work other jobs. Most restaurants also provide their employees with free or discounted meals. High end restaurants that have only one dinner meal service often provide a shared staff meal prepared by one of the chefs. The chef may also provide samples of special or new menu preparations so the waiting staff can experience the dish and be better able to describe it for the patron. Other restaurants that have multiple shifts will give an employee a meal for free or at a discount. In the United States, which does not have universal health care, some restaurants offer health insurance to staff who are employed full-time. Tipping in the United States Different countries maintain different customs regarding tipping, but, in the United States, a tip paid in addition to the amount presented on the bill for food and drinks is customary. At most sit-down restaurants, servers and bartenders expect a tip after a patron has paid the check. The minimum legally required hourly wage paid to waiters and waitresses in many U.S. states is lower than the minimum wage employers are required to pay for most other forms of labor in order to account for the tips that form a significant portion of the server's income. If wages and tips do not equal the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour during any week, the employer is required to increase cash wages to compensate. Tips average between 15% and 20% of the bill. 20% is expected for good service, more than 20% is expected for great service, and some patrons tip even more for exceptional service. If the server goes above and beyond to ensure the patron enjoys his meal, it is customary to give a higher tip. Some restaurants charge an automatic gratuity for larger parties (usually 6 or more), and the gratuity ranges from 15% to 20% depending on the restaurant. The amount an establishment requires the customer to pay is a service charge. Service charges, also known as automatic gratuities, are automatically included in the check. Common examples of service charges may include: banquet event fees, hotel fees, bottle service fees, and cruise ship fees.

The Holga's low-cost construction and simple meniscus lens often yields pictures that display vignetting, blur, light leaks, and other distortions. The camera's limitations have brought it a cult following among some photographers, and Holga photos have won awards and competitions in art and news photography. As of November 2015, production of this camera has ceased. History The Holga camera was designed by Lee Ting-mo in 1982. It first appeared outside China in 1982 in Hong Kong. At the time, 120 roll film in black-and-white was the most widely available film in mainland China. The Holga was intended to provide an inexpensive mass-market camera for the Chinese working-class in order to record family portraits and events. However, the rapid adoption of the 35 mm film format, due to new foreign camera and film imports, virtually eliminated the consumer market for 120 roll film in China.The Holga Manual: The Holga History, Freestyle Photographic Supplies (2002), p. 3 Seeking new markets, the manufacturer sought to distribute the Holga outside mainland China. Within a few years after the Holga's introduction to foreign markets, some photographers began using the Holga for its surrealistic, impressionistic scenes for landscape, still life, portrait, and especially street photography. These owners prized the Holga for its lack of precision, light leaks, and inexpensive qualities, which forced the photographer to concentrate on innovation and creative vision in place of increasingly expensive camera technology.Holga History Lomography.com, retrieved 15 April 2010 In this respect, the Holga became the successor to the Diana and other toy cameras previously used in such work. A Holga photograph by photojournalist David Burnett of former vice-president Al Gore during a 2000 campaign appearance earned a top prize in a 2001 White House News Photographers' Association Eyes of History award ceremony. Recently the Holga has experienced renewed consumer interest outside China due to the increasing popularity of toy cameras, and a continuing counterculture response to the increasing complexity of modern cameras.Holga History Lomography.com In late November 2015, Freestyle Photographic Supplies COO Gerald H. Karmele confirmed that Tokina had shut down the factory that produced Holga cameras and related accessories, ending the production of these toy cameras. A revitalized, but saturated, toy camera market led to waning sales. However, as of July 2017, Freestyle reported that the molds had been tracked down, put back into production, and the Holgas were once again available.

Lens and aperture settings A sample Holga image showing its characteristic vignetting. Most Holga cameras use a single-piece plastic meniscus lens with a focal length of 60 millimeters and utilize a zone-focus system that can adjust from about 1 meter (3 feet) to infinity. Like any simple meniscus lens, the Holga lens exhibits soft focus and chromatic aberration. Other Holga variants, denoted either by the letter 'G' in their model name, or the name WOCA, feature a simple glass lens, but are otherwise identical in construction. The manufacturer has since outsourced supply of the varying plastic and glass lenses to contractors in Japan and China There is an aperture setting switch on the camera with two positions indicated by pictorial ideograms: sunny and cloudy, with a nominal value of and , respectively. Due to a manufacturing oversight, this switch has no effect on pre-2009 production cameras, and the actual aperture is around , giving the Holga just one aperture.Hahn, Mark The Authoritative Guide to Holga Tune-Up And ModificationsEven 2009 production 120N Holgas have been recorded as having no effective aperture switch. The problem is reported as having been fixed in cameras post-2009, providing two working aperture settings of and ,Williamson, Paul \\"The Holga's Aperture\\" and earlier cameras are modifiable to provide two usable settings.Hahn, Mark, The Authoritative Guide To Holga Tune-Up and Modifications Apertures of and work well for ISO200 speed films, while settings of and tend to suit faster films of around ISO400. Film format The Holga was originally designed to accept either a 6×4.5 format or a 6×6 (square) format. However, once the camera went into production, vignetting (darkening of the corners of the finished photograph) occurred when the camera was modified to a 6×6 format. Hence, early Holgas had their film size switches tightly fixed to shoot only 6×4.5 format. Many owners removed both this restriction and the 6×4.5 film mask as well, finding the resultant vignetting a desirable effect. Later Holgas such as the 120N come with two masks for both the 6×4.5 and 6×6 format. Holgas can even be modified to use 35 mm film. The Holga has one shutter speed – approximately 1/100th of a second. The camera can shoot 16 exposures per 120 roll in 6x4.5 cm format or 12 exposures in 6x6 format. Film is advanced by a knob on the top of the camera, and frame numbers printed on the backing paper of the film can be viewed through a red window on the back of the Holga. The number of frames chosen is indicated by the black arrow. Modifications and variants 120S prepared with tape in order to prevent too many light leaks Holga cameras are often modified: * A Holga's interior can be \\"flocked\\"—coated with matte black paint—in order to limit the effect of light bouncing off the plastic interior from light leaks. * The red window on the camera back can be blocked by an improvised cover to eliminate light leaks when using panchromatic films * The Holga's aperture switch can be modified as needed to provide a larger ('cloudy') or smaller ('sunny') aperture. * The lens, and sometimes the entire shutter assembly, can be replaced with a pinhole (the \\"Pinholga\\"). * The plastic lens can be replaced with a glass version (the \\"Woca\\") or can be completely removed. * Newer models of the camera come with multiple optional frame inserts (4.5 × 6 cm and 6 × 6 cm). Shooting without an insert can lead to problems keeping the 120 size film flat against the film plane. * Inserting cardboard or foam or felt padding under or behind the film spool to provide proper film tensioning An example of a \\"sprocket hole\\" exposure when using 35 mm film in a modified Holga 120. * The Holga TIM camera has two fixed focus plastic lenses which work simultaneously, allowing for the capture of 3D images.Pawel Piejko, Gizmag. \\"Holga's TIM camera lets film fans experiment in 3D.\\" 5 July 2011. Retrieved 22 July 2011. Some modifications permit the use of other film formats: * Holga cameras may be fitted with a Polaroid back, allowing use of Polaroid 80 series instant film, or with newer models, 100 series film (but the image is not centered). This modification, sometimes termed a \\"Holgaroid\\" or \\"Polga\\", renders the viewfinder unusable, but allows for instant Holga prints. * By sandwiching a normal 35 mm roll of film into the Holga's 120 spool, \\"sprocket hole\\" exposures may be taken that expose the entire surface of 135 film. * Cameras such as the Hasselblad have been modified to make use of a Holga lens. * Holga plastic lenses have also been adapted to the Canon EOS, the Nikon f-mount, Pentax, Sony, Olympus and Minolta. An f-mount, 'melted' plastic Holga lens has been used on a digital f-mount camera while the EOS Holga has been mounted to the latest Canon DSLRs. Adapted lenses are also commercially available. Concept Holga D In 2010, designer Saikat Biswas proposed a concept for a digital version of the Holga camera, called Holga D. It has a modernized case, but retains the simplicity of the original camera. However, there is no evidence of current plans to produce this device, or produce any other digital version. Holga Digital On 27 August 2015, a Kickstarter campaign was launched to fund the creation of a digital camera styled after a Holga 120, called the Holga Digital. This model includes a glass optic with and aperture settings and a sliding switch that alternates between black and white and color mode. It has a low-noise CMOS color sensor with an 8-megapixel resolution. The camera does not have a means of viewing the pictures saved to its SD Card. Accessories Accessories exist that will do the same thing as a modified Holga without the need for physical modifications as well as accessories for special effects. Such accessories include: * Cable release, which slips onto the lens so that a cable release can depress the shutter. Also includes tripod mount since the Holga 120N's mount is covered by the accessory. * 35 mm Film Adapter, available in two models: full negative and \\"panoramic.\\" Both adapters come with a light-proof back and a mask made to hold the 135 canister in place. The only difference between the two models is the size of the mask. The \\"panoramic\\" adapter will mask out the sprocket holes. A rarer model available in Japan is an all-in-one back and cartridge unit. * Fisheye lens, produces circular Fisheye images. * Filter holder and filters. Filter holders can hold one or two filters, depending on the model of the holder.

A lifting body is a foil or a complete foil-bearing body such as a fixed-wing aircraft. CL is a function of the angle of the body to the flow, its Reynolds number and its Mach number. The section lift coefficient cl refers to the dynamic lift characteristics of a two-dimensional foil section, with the reference area replaced by the foil chord.Abbott, Ira H., and Doenhoff, Albert E. von: Theory of Wing Sections. Section 1.2 Definitions  The lift coefficient CL is defined byClancy, L. J.: Aerodynamics. Section 4.15 :C_\\\\mathrm L \\\\equiv \\\\frac{L}{q \\\\, S} = {\\\\frac{L}{\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho u^2 \\\\, S}} = {\\\\frac{2 L}{\\\\rho u^2S}} , where L\\\\, is the lift force, S\\\\, is the relevant surface area and q\\\\, is the fluid dynamic pressure, in turn linked to the fluid density \\\\rho\\\\,, and to the flow speed u\\\\,. The choice of the reference surface should be specified since it is arbitrary. For example, for cylindric profiles (the 3D extrusion of an airfoil in the spanwise direction) it is always oriented in the spanwise direction, but while in aerodynamics and thin airfoil theory the second axis generating the surface is commonly the chordwise direction: :S_{aer} \\\\equiv c \\\\, s resulting in a coefficient: :C_{\\\\mathrm L, \\\\, aer} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{L}{q \\\\, c \\\\, s}, while for thick airfoils and in marine dynamics, the second axis is sometimes taken in the thickness direction: :S_{mar} = t \\\\, s resulting in a different coefficient: :C_{\\\\mathrm L, \\\\, mar} \\\\equiv \\\\frac{L}{q \\\\, t \\\\, s} The ratio between these two coefficients is the thickness ratio: :C_{\\\\mathrm L, \\\\, mar} \\\\equiv \\\\frac c t C_{\\\\mathrm L, \\\\, aer} The lift coefficient can be approximated using the lifting-line theory,Clancy, L. J.: Aerodynamics. Section 8.11 numerically calculated or measured in a wind tunnel test of a complete aircraft configuration.  Section lift coefficient  A typical curve showing section lift coefficient versus angle of attack for a cambered airfoil Lift coefficient may also be used as a characteristic of a particular shape (or cross-section) of an airfoil. In this application it is called the section lift coefficient c_\\\\text{l}. It is common to show, for a particular airfoil section, the relationship between section lift coefficient and angle of attack.Abbott, Ira H., and Von Doenhoff, Albert E.: Theory of Wing Sections. Appendix IV It is also useful to show the relationship between section lift coefficient and drag coefficient. The section lift coefficient is based on two-dimensional flow over a wing of infinite span and non-varying cross-section so the lift is independent of spanwise effects and is defined in terms of l, the lift force per unit span of the wing. The definition becomes :c_\\\\text{l} = \\\\frac{l}{q \\\\, L}, where L is the reference length that should always be specified: in aerodynamics and airfoil theory usually the airfoil chord c\\\\, is chosen, while in marine dynamics and for struts usually the thickness t\\\\, is chosen. Note this is directly analogous to the drag coefficient since the chord can be interpreted as the \\"area per unit span\\". For a given angle of attack, cl can be calculated approximately using the thin airfoil theory,Clancy, L. J.: Aerodynamics. Section 8.2 calculated numerically or determined from wind tunnel tests on a finite-length test piece, with end- plates designed to ameliorate the three-dimensional effects. Plots of cl versus angle of attack show the same general shape for all airfoils, but the particular numbers will vary. They show an almost linear increase in lift coefficient with increasing angle of attack with a gradient known as the lift slope. For a thin airfoil of any shape the lift slope is π2/90 ≃ 0.11 per degree. At higher angles a maximum point is reached, after which the lift coefficient reduces. The angle at which maximum lift coefficient occurs is the stall angle of the airfoil, which is approximately 10 to 15 degrees on a typical airfoil. The stall angle for a given profile is also increasing with increasing values of the Reynolds number, at higher speeds indeed the flow tends to stay attached to the profile for longer delaying the stall condition. For this reason sometimes wind tunnel testing performed at lower Reynolds numbers than the simulated real life condition can sometimes give conservative feedback overestimating the profiles stall. Symmetric airfoils necessarily have plots of cl versus angle of attack symmetric about the cl axis, but for any airfoil with positive camber, i.e. asymmetrical, convex from above, there is still a small but positive lift coefficient with angles of attack less than zero. That is, the angle at which cl = 0 is negative. On such airfoils at zero angle of attack the pressures on the upper surface are lower than on the lower surface.

The need for ASPs has evolved from the increasing costs of specialized software that have far exceeded the price range of small to medium-sized businesses. As well, the growing complexities of software have led to huge costs in distributing the software to end-users. Through ASPs, the complexities and costs of such software can be cut down. In addition, the issues of upgrading have been eliminated from the end-firm by placing the onus on the ASP to maintain up-to-date services, 24 x 7 technical support, physical and electronic security and in-built support for business continuity and flexible working. The importance of this marketplace is reflected by its size. , estimates of the United States market ranged from 1.5 to 4 billion dollars. Clients for ASP services include businesses, government organizations, non- profits, and membership organizations. Provider types There are several forms of ASP business. These are: *A specialist or functional ASP delivers a single application, such as credit card payment processing or timesheet services; *A vertical market ASP delivers a solution package for a specific customer type, such as a dental practice; *An enterprise ASP delivers broad spectrum solutions; *A local ASP delivers small business services within a limited area. Some analysts identify a volume ASP as a fifth type. This is basically a specialist ASP that offers a low cost packaged solution via their own website. PayPal was an instance of this type, and their volume was one way to lower the unit cost of each transaction. In addition to these types, some large multi-line companies (such as HP and IBM), use ASP concepts as a particular business model that supports some specific customers. The ASP model The application software resides on the vendor's system and is accessed by users through a web browser using HTML or by special purpose client software provided by the vendor. Custom client software can also interface to these systems through XML APIs. These APIs can also be used where integration with in-house systems is required. ASPs may or may not use multitenancy in the deployment of software to clients; some ASPs offer an instance or license to each customer (for example using Virtualization), some deploy in a single instance multi-tenant access mode, now more frequently referred to as \\"SaaS\\". Common features associated with ASPs include: * ASP fully owns and operates the software application(s) * ASP owns, operates and maintains the servers that support the software * ASP makes information available to customers via the Internet or a \\"thin client\\" * ASP bills on a \\"per-use\\" basis or on a monthly/annual fee The advantages to this approach include: * Software integration issues are eliminated from the client site * Software costs for the application are spread over a number of clients * Vendors can build more application experience than the in-house staff * Low- code development platforms permit limited customization of pre-built applications * Key software systems are kept up to date, available, and managed for performance by experts * Improved reliability, availability, scalability and security of internal IT systems * A provider's service level agreement guarantees a certain level of service * Access to product and technology experts dedicated to available products * Reduction of internal IT costs to a predictable monthly fee * Redeploying IT staff and tools to focus on strategic technology projects that impact the enterprise's bottom line Some inherent disadvantages include: * The client must generally accept the application as provided since ASPs can only afford a customized solution for the largest clients. * The client may rely on the provider to provide a critical business function, thus limiting their control of that function and instead relying on the provider * Changes in the ASP market may result in changes in the type or level of service available to clients * Integration with the client's non-ASP systems may be problematic Evaluating an Application Service Provider security when moving to an ASP infrastructure can come at a high cost, as such a firm must assess the level of risk associated with the ASP itself. Failure to properly account for such risk can lead to: * Loss of control of corporate data * Loss of control of corporate image * Insufficient ASP security to counter risks * Exposure of corporate data to other ASP customers * Compromise of corporate data Some other risks include failure to account for the financial future of the ASP in general, i.e. how stable a company is and if it has the resources to continue business into the foreseeable future. For these reasons Cisco Systems has developed a comprehensive evaluation guideline. This guideline includes evaluating the scope of the ASP's service, the security of the program and the ASP's maturity with regard to security awareness. Finally the guidelines indicate the importance of performing audits on the ASP with respect to: * Port/Network service * Application vulnerability * ASP Personnel Physical visits to the ASP to assess the formality of the organization will provide invaluable insight into the awareness of the firm. History In terms of their common goal of enabling customers to outsource specific computer applications so they can focus on their core competencies, ASPs may be regarded as the indirect descendant of the service bureaus of the 1960s and 1970s. In turn, those bureaus were trying to fulfill the vision of computing as a utility, which was first proposed by John McCarthy in a speech at MIT in 1961. Jostein Eikeland, the founder of TeleComputing, is credited with coining the acronym ASP in 1996, according to Inc. Magazine. Traver H. Kennedy, founder and ex-Chairman of the ASP Industry Consortium, has been known as the \\"father of the ASP industry\\".http://articles.sun- sentinel.com/2001-01-14/business/0101121048_1_citrix-systems-network-magazine- technology-pioneer Comparisons The ASP model is often compared with Software as a Service (SaaS), but while the latter typically delivers a generic service at scale to many users, the former typically involved delivering a service to a small number of users (often using separate single- tenant instances). This meant that the many benefits of multi-tenancy (cost sharing, economies of scale, etc.) were not accessible to ASP providers, and their services were more comparable to in-house hosting than to true multi- tenant SaaS solutions like Salesforce.com.

General introduction This diurnal gecko only lives on the Agaléga Islands. It typically inhabits coconut trees or cheval trees. The Agalega day gecko feeds on insects and nectar. Description This lizard belongs to the medium-sized day geckos. Males are slightly larger than females and can reach a total length of about 16 cm whereas females measure only 13.5 cm. The basic body colour is grayish green. Both the head and the neck are yellow-brown. The tail and back can be bright turquoise. The flanks are grey or beige. The dorso-lateral bands are turquoise. On the back and tail there are brownish or red-brick coloured dots or bars. Distribution This species is endemic to the two Agalega islets. Habitat The two islands where P. borbonica agalega occurs, are small low coral sand islands. On these islands are mainly coconut tree plantations. The Agalega day gecko is often found on these trees as well as on Terminalia spec. and mango trees. Diet These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar. Behaviour This Phelsuma species is rather shy. Reproduction The pairing season is between April and the first weeks of September. During this period, the females lay up to 4 pairs of eggs, often under loose bark of coconut trees. Females often share the same location for their eggs. The young will hatch after approximately 70–100 days, depending on the temperature. The juveniles measure 45–50 mm. Care and maintenance in captivity These animals should be housed in pairs and need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between 24 and 30 °C. During the night the temperature can drop to 18–22 °C. The relative humidity should be maintained between 40 and 60% during the day and 75% at night. These animals can be fed with crickets, wax moths, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies. References *Henkel, F.-W. and W.

Citrix products are claimed to be in use by over 400,000 clients worldwide, including 99% of the Fortune 100, and 98% of the Fortune 500. The company was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by Ed Iacobucci, who served as chairman until his departure in 2000. It began by developing remote access products for Microsoft operating systems, licensing source code from Microsoft, and has been in partnership with the company throughout its history. By the 1990s, Citrix came to prominence as an industry leader in thin client technology, enabling purpose-built devices to access remote servers and resources. The company launched its first initial public offering in 1995 and, with few competitors, experienced large revenue increases between 1995 and 1999. Citrix acquired Sequoia Software Corp. in 2001 and ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in 2003. This was followed by more than a dozen other acquisitions from 2005 to 2012, which allowed Citrix to expand into server and desktop virtualization, cloud computing, Infrastructure as a Service, and Software as a Service offerings. In 2014, Citrix acquired Framehawk and used its technology to improve the delivery of virtual desktops and applications over wireless networks. In 2016, as part of a US$1.8 billion product deal with LogMeIn, Citrix spun off the GoTo product line into a new business entity, entitled GetGo. In 2017, Citrix completed the merger of GetGo with LogMeIn's products. Citrix has corporate headquarters in both Fort Lauderdale, Florida and Santa Clara, California, with subsidiary operations in California and Massachusetts, and additional development centers in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, India, and the United Kingdom. Citrix in January 2018 reported revenue from continuing operations of $2.82 billion for fiscal year 2017, compared to $2.74 billion for fiscal year 2016, a 3% increase. As of April 2017, the company employed approximately 8,100 employees worldwide. History  Early history Citrix was founded in Richardson, Texas in 1989 by former IBM developer Ed Iacobucci with $3 million in funding. Following its initial setup and development, Iacobucci moved the company to his former home of Coral Springs, Florida. The company's first employees were five other engineers from IBM that Iacobucci convinced to join his team. Iacobucci served as chairman of the company and Roger Roberts became the CEO of Citrix in 1990. Citrix was originally named Citrus, but changed its name after an existing company claimed trademark rights. The Citrix name is a portmanteau of Citrus and UNIX. The company's first product was Citrix Multiuser, an extension of OS/2 developed over two years. Citrix licensed the OS/2 source code from Microsoft, and developed its own Independent Computing Architecture (ICA) protocol for Citrix Multiuser. Multiuser allowed multiple users working on separate computers remote access to software on a server, even from computers not built to run OS/2. Three days before the product launched in 1991, Microsoft announced they would be switching from OS/2 to Windows. The switch made Multiuser nearly unusable without significant changes to make it compatible with Windows or DOS. The company discussed closing in 1991, but investments from Intel, Microsoft and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers among others, allowed the company to work on a new version of Multiuser. Multi-Win version 2.0 was released in 1992. It was compatible with DOS applications and allowed up to five users. In 1993, Citrix released a new remote applications server, WinView, which had the ability to run DOS and Windows applications. By 1994, the company's yearly revenue equaled US$10 million. The company launched WinFrame, a multi-user operating system based on Microsoft's Windows NT, in 1995. The new product allowed up to 15 users and was the first thin client for Windows. Rise in popularity Citrix had its initial public offering in December 1995. The company's share price doubled from $15 to $30. During the mid-1990s, Citrix became the leader of its growing industry with very few competitors, and the company's revenues doubled year over year between 1995 and 1999. Following weeks of discussions, Iacobucci was able to persuade Microsoft to agree to license Citrix technology for Windows NT Server 4.0, which resulted in Windows Terminal Server Edition in 1998. This agreement allowed Citrix to keep its position in the marketplace and be NT 4.0 compatible. Citrix also earned $75 million through the agreement, along with a royalty arrangement that was valued at approximately $100 million. Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best using the ICA protocol developed by Citrix and found in MetaFrame. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines running Terminal Server Edition. In 1997, the company opened a new headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It also opened offices in Sydney, London and Paris that same year. In 1998, Mark Templeton became the CEO of Citrix after serving as vice president of marketing. Also in 1998, it licensed its ICA protocol to IBM and Key Tronics. Citrix licensed its ICA protocol to Motorola for use in digital wireless handsets in 1999. During 1999, the thin-client model Citrix used, became a software trend and the company's customers increased to 15 million. Major clients included Sears, AT&T;, and Chevron. A sudden drop in stocks in 2000 led to Iacobucci leaving the company and CEO Mark Templeton being demoted to president and senior executive officer. Templeton was later reinstated in 2001. Expansion In 2001 Citrix acquired the Sequoia Software Corp. for $185 million. That same year it released MetaFrame XP, a new platform using MetaFrame technology. This was later rebranded by Citrix as Presentation Server, in 2005. On July 9, 2002, Citrix announced a 10% job cut. At the time the company employed about 1,900 workers. After the announcement the stock hit a five-year low. Citrix acquired ExpertCity, a provider of remote desktop products, in December 2003 for $225 million in cash and stock. The acquisition was the largest for the company up to that date. Through the acquisition, Citrix gained ExpertCity's existing products GoToMyPC and GoToAssist, and ExpertCity became the Citrix Online division of the company. In 2004, the company introduced Citrix GoToMeeting. Between 2005 and 2012, the company acquired over a dozen companies that allowed them to expand in new markets. Citrix acquired acceleration hardware maker NetScaler in 2005, which allowed the company to offer optimized application delivery. The company entered the server and desktop virtualization market with the purchase of XenSource in August 2007. Citrix expanded cloud and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offerings in August 2010 with the acquisition of VMLogix. In February 2011, Citrix entered the European Software as a Service (SaaS) market with the acquisition of Netviewer. In 2007, the company opened a headquarters in Silicon Valley.

Paul Jansen is the editor-in-chief of the paper that is owned by the Telegraaf Media Groep that also publishes the free daily Metro. History Advertisement poster, 1898 19th century De Telegraaf was founded by Henry Tindal, who simultaneously started another paper De Courant (\\"The Gazette\\"). The first issue appeared on 1 January 1893. 20th century Following Tindal's death on 31 January 1902 the printer HMC Holdert, with backing from financiers, took over De Telegraaf and De Courant on 12 September 1902. This proved to be a good investment, particularly with regard to De Courant, enabling Holdert between 1903 and 1923 to take over one newspaper after another, suspending publication as he went. He added the name Amsterdamsche Courant (\\"Amsterdam Gazette\\") as a subtitle to De Telegraaf, and Het Nieuws van den Dag (\\"The News of the Day\\") to De Courant. During World War I, when the Netherlands was officially neutral, Holdert's French sympathies and his pro-British standpoint caused De Telegraaf to be the focus of some controversy, as the Netherlands were usually pro-German at the time. In 1926, Holdert began construction of a new printing facility at the Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal in Amsterdam, designed by J.F. Staal and G.J. Langhout. Construction was completed and the building occupied in 1930. During World War II, the Telegraaf companies published pro-German papers, which led to a thirty-year ban on publishing after the war. The prohibition was, however, lifted in 1949 and De Telegraaf flourished anew to become the biggest newspaper in the Netherlands. At one point, in June 1966, the Telegraaf building was besieged by angry construction workers and Provo followers, after a false report that a victim of a labour dispute had been killed not by the police but by a co-worker. In 1974, De Telegraaf moved to a new location on the Basisweg. In the period of 1995–1996 De Telegraaf had a circulation of 760,000 copies, making it the best-selling paper in the country. De Courant/Nieuws van de Dag ceased publication in 1998. In 1999, the circulation of the paper was 808,000 copies, making it the ninth best selling European newspaper. 21st century De Telegraaf was the eighth top European newspaper with a circulation of 807,000 copies in 2001. It added a Sunday edition on 21 March 2004. The Sunday edition was dropped on 27 December 2009.

Life Johann Bernhard Bach was born in Erfurt in 1676 (most probably in November), in the house named \\"Zu den drei Rosen\\" (The Three Roses), in Junkersand Street, and was baptized on 25 November 1676 in Erfurt's Merchant's Church (Kaufmannskirche). He – like his younger brother Johann Christoph, born in 1685 – received his early musical tuition from his father Johann Aegidius Bach. After attending the Schola Mercatorum at Erfurt he entered Erfurt's major secondary school at that time, RatsgymnasiumSiegfried Orth: Zu den Erfurter Jahren Johann Bernhard Bachs (1676-1749), 1971, S. 107. As early as 1695, at the age of 18, he became the organist at the Kaufmannskirche. In 1699 he moved to Magdeburg where he was appointed organist for St. Catharine's Church. In 1703 John William III, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach called him to Eisenach to serve as harpsichordist at the ducal court. In Eisenach he also became the organist at St. George's Church, succeeding his uncle Johann Christoph Bach. From 1708 to 1712 Johann Bernhard Bach worked together with Georg Philipp Telemann who held, first, the position of the leader of the violin section, and, from August 1709, that of a conductor (Kapellmeister) at Eisenach's ducal orchestra. On 6 August 1716 Johann Bernhard Bach married Johanna Sophia Siefer. Three children were born into the family.Siegfried Orth: Zu den Erfurter Jahren Johann Bernhard Bachs (1676-1749), 1971, S. 110 In 1741 the ducal orchestra was dissolved, which meant that Johann Bernhard continued to work exclusively as choirmaster and organist, until his death, apparently still receiving the ducal allowance of 100 Thalers per year.MGG Online, 2016, S. 29 With his famous cousin Johann Sebastian Bach Johann Bernhard kept a life-long friendship. In 1715 he acted as godfather for Johann Sebastian's son Johann Gottfried Bernhard, whilst Johann Sebastian became godfather to Johann Bernhard's eldest son Johann Ernst in 1722. This latter was to succeed his father Johann Bernhard as organist at St. George's Church in Eisenach. Work Most of his musical output has been lost, but amongst his surviving music there are four orchestral suites. It is known that J.S. Bach had individual parts prepared for performance by his orchestra. His musical style has been described as being similar to that of Telemann. The surviving orchestral suites (overtures) are as follows: *Suite No. 1 in G minor *Suite No. 2 in G major *Suite No. 3 in E minor *Suite No. 4 in D major They are thought to have been written before 1730.

Her work often explores LGBT bodies, moments of intimacy, the HIV crisis, and the opioid epidemic. Her most notable work is The Ballad of Sexual Dependency (1986), which documents the post-Stonewall gay subculture and Goldin's family and friends. She lives and works in New York City, Berlin, and Paris. Early life upright Goldin was born in Washington, D.C. in 1953 and grew up in the Boston suburb of Lexington to middle-class Jewish parents. Goldin's father worked in broadcasting and served as the chief economist for the Federal Communications Commission.Deborah Solomon (October 9, 1996), Nan Goldin: Scenes From the Edge The Wall Street Journal. Goldin had early exposure to tense family relationships, sexuality, and suicide, as her parents often argued about Goldin's older sister Barbara who ultimately committed suicide when Goldin was 11: > This was in 1965, when teenage suicide was a taboo subject. I was very close > to my sister and aware of some of the forces that led her to choose suicide. > I saw the role that her sexuality and its repression played in her > destruction. Because of the times, the early sixties, women who were angry > and sexual were frightening, outside the range of acceptable behavior, > beyond control. By the time she was eighteen, she saw that her only way to > get out was to lie down on the tracks of the commuter train outside of > Washington, D.C. It was an act of immense will. Goldin began to smoke marijuana and date an older man, and by age 13–14, she left home and enrolled at the Satya Community School in Lincoln. A Satya staff member (experimental philosopher Rollo May's daughter) introduced Goldin to the camera in 1968 when she was fifteen years old. Still struggling from her sister's death, Goldin used the camera and photography to cherish her relationships with those she photographed. She also found the camera as a useful political tool, to inform the public about important issues silenced in America. Her early influences included Andy Warhol's early films, Federico Fellini, Jack Smith, French and Italian Vogue, Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton.  Career  Goldin's first solo show, held in Boston in 1973, was based on her photographic journeys among the city's gay and transgender communities, to which she had been introduced by her friend David Armstrong. While living in downtown Boston at age 18, Goldin \\"fell in with the drag queens,\\" living with them and photographing them.Westfall, Stephen. \\"The Ballad of Nan Goldin.\\" BOMB No. 37 (1991): 27–31.JSTOR. Web. Mar 3, 2015. Among her work from this period is Ivy wearing a fall, Boston (1973). Unlike some photographers who were interested in psychoanalyzing or exposing the queens, Goldin admired and respected their sexuality. Goldin said, \\"My desire was to show them as a third gender, as another sexual option, a gender option. And to show them with a lot of respect and love, to kind of glorify them because I really admire people who can recreate themselves and manifest their fantasies publicly. I think it's brave\\". Goldin admitted to being romantically in love with a queen during this period of her life in a Q&A; with Bomb \\"I remember going through a psychology book trying to find something about it when I was nineteen. There was one little chapter about it in an abnormal psych book that made it sound so ... I don't know what they ascribed it to, but it was so bizarre. And that's where I was at that time in my life. I lived with them; it was my whole focus. Everything I did – that's who I was all the time. And that's who I wanted to be\\". Goldin describes her life as being completely immersed in the queens'. However, upon attending the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, when her professors told her to go back and photograph queens again, Goldin admitted her work was not the same as when she had lived with them. Goldin graduated from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1977/1978, where she had worked mostly with Cibachrome prints. Her work from this period is associated with the Boston School of Photography. Following graduation, Goldin moved to New York City. She began documenting the post-punk new-wave music scene, along with the city's vibrant, post-Stonewall gay subculture of the late 1970s and early 1980s. She was drawn especially to the hard-drug subculture of the Bowery neighborhood; these photographs, taken between 1979 and 1986, form her slideshow The Ballad of Sexual Dependency—a title taken from a song in Bertolt Brecht's Threepenny Opera.Brecht, Bertolt. \\"Three Penny Opera.\\" Act II, song 12. Later published as a book with help from Marvin Heiferman, Mark Holborn, and Suzanne Fletcher, these snapshot aesthetic images depict drug use, violent, aggressive couples and autobiographical moments. In her foreword to the book she describes it as a \\"diary [she] lets people read\\" of people she referred to as her \\"tribe\\". Part of Ballad was driven by the need to remember her extended family. Photography was a way for her to hold onto her friends, she hoped. The photographs show a transition through Goldin's travels and her life. Most of her Ballad subjects were dead by the 1990s, lost either to drug overdose or AIDS; this tally included close friends and often-photographed subjects Greer Lankton and Cookie Mueller.Curley, Mallory. A Cookie Mueller Encyclopedia, Randy Press, 2010. In 2003, The New York Times nodded to the work's impact, explaining Goldin had \\"forged a genre, with photography as influential as any in the last twenty years.\\"Tillman, Lynne. The New York Times. \\"A New Chapter of Nan Goldin's Diary.\\" November 16, 2003. In addition to Ballad, she combined her Bowery pictures in two other series: I'll Be Your Mirror (from a song by The Velvet Underground) and All By Myself. Goldin's work is most often presented in the form of a slideshow, and has been shown at film festivals; her most famous being a 45-minute show in which 800 pictures are displayed. The main themes of her early pictures are love, gender, domesticity, and sexuality. She has affectionately documented women looking in mirrors, girls in bathrooms and barrooms, drag queens, sexual acts, and the culture of obsession and dependency. The images are viewed like a private journal made public. In the book Auto-Focus, her photographs are described as a way to \\"learn the stories and intimate details of those closest to her\\". It speaks of her uncompromising manner and style when photographing acts such as drug use, sex, violence, arguments, and traveling. It references one of Goldin's notable photographs \\"Nan One Month After Being Battered, 1984\\" as an iconic image which she uses to reclaim her identity and her life. Goldin's work since 1995 has included a wide array of subject matter: collaborative book projects with Japanese photographer Nobuyoshi Araki; New York City skylines; uncanny landscapes (notably of people in water); her lover, Siobhan; and babies, parenthood and family life. In 2000, her hand was injured and she currently retains less ability to turn it than in the past. upright=1.5 In 2006, her exhibition, Chasing a Ghost, opened in New York. It was the first installation by her to include moving pictures, a fully narrative score, and voiceover, and included the three-screen slide and video presentation Sisters, Saints, & Sybils. The work involved her sister Barbara's suicide and how she coped through production of numerous images and narratives. Her works are developing more and more into cinemaesque features, exemplifying her gravitation towards working with films. Goldin has undertaken commercial fashion photography—for Australian label Scanlan & Theodore's Spring/Summer 2010 campaign, shot with model Erin Wasson; for Italian luxury label Bottega Veneta's Spring/Summer 2010 campaign with models Sean O'Pry and Anya Kazakova, evoking memories of her Ballad of Sexual Dependency;Ann Binlot (January 3, 2012), Bottega Veneta Taps Jack Pierson for Latest Arty Ad Campaign BLOUINARTINFO. for shoemaker Jimmy Choo in 2011 with model Linda Vojtova;Ann Binlot (October 18, 2011), The Ballad of Shoe Dependency: Nan Goldin Shoots a New Ad Campaign for Jimmy Choo BLOUINARTINFO. and for Dior in 2013, 1000 LIVES, featuring Robert Pattinson. After some time, her photos moved from portrayals of dangerous youthful abandonment to scenes of parenthood and family life in progressively worldwide settings. Goldin currently resides and works in New York, Paris, as well as London. In March 2018, clothing brand Supreme released a collaborative range with Goldin as part of their Spring/Summer 2018 collection. This consisted of jackets, sweatshirts and t-shirts in various colors, with designs titled \\"Misty and Jimmy Paulette\\", \\"Kim in Rhinestone\\" and \\"Nan as a dominatrix\\".  Activism  In 2017, in a speech in Brazil, Goldin revealed she was recovering from opioid addiction, specifically to OxyContin, after being prescribed the drug for a painful wrist. She had sought treatment for her addiction and battled through rehab. This led to her setting up a campaign called Prescription Addiction Intervention Now (P.A.I.N.) pursuing social media activism directed against the Sackler family for their involvement in Purdue Pharma, manufacturers of OxyContin. Goldin has said the campaign attempts to contrast the philanthropic contributions of the Sackler family to art galleries, museums and universities with a lack of responsibility taken for the opioid crisis. Goldin only became aware of the Sackler family in 2017. In 2018, she organized a protest in the Sackler Wing's Temple of Dendur at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The protest called for museums and other cultural institutions not to accept money from the Sackler family. Also in 2018 she was one of several artists who participated in a $100 sale organized by Magnum Photos and Aperture to raise funds for Goldin's opioid awareness group P.A.I.N. (Prescription Addiction Intervention Now). > \\"I’ve started a group called P.A.I.N. to address the opioid crisis. We are a > group of artists, activists and addicts that believe in direct action. We > target the Sackler family, who manufactured and pushed OxyContin, through > the museums and universities that carry their name. We speak for the 250,000 > bodies that no longer can.\\" In February 2019 Goldin staged a protest at the Guggenheim Museum in New York over its acceptance of funding by the Sackler family. She also said that she would withdraw from a retrospective exhibition of her work at the National Portrait Gallery in London if they did not turn down a gift of £1 million from the Sacklers. The gallery subsequently said it would not proceed with the donation. Two days after the National Portrait Gallery statement, the Tate group of British art galleries (Tate Modern and Tate Britain in London, Tate St Ives and Tate Liverpool) announced it would no longer accept any gifts offered by members of the Sackler family, from whom it had received £4m. Tate Modern had been planning to display its copy of Goldin's The Ballad of Sexual Dependency slideshow, for a year from April 15, 2019.> Goldin had not discussed the show with Tate. Goldin identified that Tate, which has received Sackler money, paid her for one of the ten copies of The Ballad of Sexual Dependency in 2015, when she was deeply addicted to OxyContin. She says she spent some of the money on buying black market OxyContin, as doctors would no longer prescribe her the drug. In July 2019 Goldin and others from the group Prescription Addiction Intervention Now staged a protest in the fountain at the Louvre in Paris. The protest was to try to persuade the museum to change the name of its Sackler wing, which is made up of 12 rooms. In November 2019 Goldin campaigned at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Criticism Some critics have accused Goldin of making heroin use appear glamorous and of pioneering a grunge style that later became popularized by youth fashion magazines such as The Face and I-D. However, in a 2002 interview with The Observer, Goldin herself called the use of \\"heroin chic\\" to sell clothes and perfumes \\"reprehensible and evil.\\" Goldin admits to having a romanticized image of drug culture at a young age, but she soon saw the error in this ideal: \\"I had a totally romantic notion of being a junkie. I wanted to be one.\\" Goldin's substance usage stopped after she became intrigued with the idea of memory in her work, \\"When people talk about the immediacy in my work, that's what its about: this need to remember and record every single thing\\" Goldin's interest in drugs stemmed from a sort of rebellion against parental guidance that parallels her decision to run away from home at a young age, \\"I wanted to get high from a really early age. I wanted to be a junkie. That's what intrigues me. Part was the Velvet Underground and the Beats and all that stuff. But, really, I wanted to be as different from my mother as I could and define myself as far as possible from the suburban life I was brought up in.\\"2014, Sean O'Hagan,\\"The Guardian\\",\\"Nan Goldin:\\"I wanted to get high from a really early age.\\" Goldin denies the role of voyeur; she is instead a queer insider sharing the same experiences as her subjects: \\"I'm not crashing; this is my party. This is my family, my history.\\" She insists her subjects have veto power over what she exhibits. In Fantastic Tales Liz Kotz criticizes Goldin's claim that she is just as much a part of what she is photographing rather than exploiting her subjects. Goldin's insistence on intimacy between artist and subject is an attempt to relegitimize the codes and conventions of social documentary, presumably by ridding them of their problematic enmeshment with the histories of social surveillance and coercion, says Kotz. [Her] insider status does nothing to alter the way her pictures convert her audience into voyeurs. Censorship An exhibition of Goldin's work was censored in Brazil, two months before opening, due to its sexually explicit nature. The main reason was that some of the photographs contained sexual acts performed near children. In Brazil, there is a law that prohibits the image of minors associated with pornography. The sponsor of the exhibition, a cellphone company, claimed to be unaware of the content of Goldin's work and that there was a conflict between the work and its educational project. The curator of the Rio de Janeiro Museum of Modern Art changed the schedule to accommodate, in February 2012, the Goldin exhibition in Brazil.  Influences   Diane Arbus  Both Goldin and Diane Arbus celebrate those who live marginal lives. Stills from Variety are compared to Arbus' magazine work; the Variety series portray \\"the rich collision of music, club life, and art production of the Lower East Side pre and post AIDS period\\". Both artists ask to reexamine artists' intentionality.  Michelangelo Antonioni  One of the reasons Goldin began photographing was Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow Up (1966). The sexuality and glamour of the film exerted a \\"huge effect\\" on her. Referring to images shown in Ballad, \\"the beaten down and beaten up personages, with their gritty, disheveled miens, which populate these early pictures, often photographed in the dark and dank, ramshackle interiors, relate physically and emotionally to the alienated and marginal character types that attracted Antonioni.\\"  Larry Clark  The youths in Larry Clark's Tulsa (1971) presented a striking contrast to any wholesome, down-home stereotype of the heartland that captured the collective American imagination. He turned the camera on himself and his lowlife amphetamine-shooting board of hanger-ons. Goldin would adopt Clark's approach to image-making. Personal life Goldin is bisexual.

Exhibitions curated by Goldin   Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing  Curated by Goldin at Artists Space, Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing (November 16, 1989 – January 6, 1990) invited New York artists to respond to the HIV/AIDS crisis. Artists represented included David Armstrong, Tom Chesley, Dorit Cypris, Philip-Lorca DiCorcia, Jane Dickson, Darrel Ellis, Allen Frame, Peter Hujar, Greer Lankton, Siobhan Liddel, James Nares, Perico Pastor, Margo Pelletier, Clarence Elie Rivera, Vittorio Scarpati, Jo Shane, Kiki Smith, Janet Stein, Stephen Tashjian, Shellburne Thurber, Ken Tisa, and David Wojnarowicz. Goldin noted that artists' works varied in response, as \\"out of loss comes memory pieces, tributes to friends and lovers who have died; out of anger comes explorations of the political cause and effects of the disease.\\" David Wojnarowicz's essay \\"Post Cards from America: X-Rays from Hell\\" in the exhibition's catalogue criticized conservative legislation that Wojnarowicz believed would increase the spread of HIV by discouraging safe sex education. Additionally, Wojnarowicz speaks about the efficacy of making the private public via the model of outing, as he and Goldin believed empowerment begins through self-disclosure. Embracing personal identities then becomes a political statement that disrupts oppressive rules of behavior of bourgeois society – though Wojnarowicz does admit outing may lock a subject into a single frozen identity. Goldin's show, and in particular Wojnarowicz's essay, was met with criticism, leading to the National Endowment of Arts rescinding its support for the publication.  From Desire: A Queer Diary  Goldin's second curated show, From Desire: A Queer Diary (March 29 – April 19, 1991), was held at the Richard F. Brush Art Gallery at St. Lawrence University, Canton, NY. Artists who were exhibited included David Armstrong, Eve Ashcraft, Kathryn Clark, Joyce Culver, Zoe Leonard, Simon Leung, Robert Mapplethorpe, Robert Windrum, and David Wojnarowicz. Nan's Guests Rencontres d'Arles festival, Arles, France. This included the work of thirteen photographers including Antoine d'Agata, David Armstrong, JH Engström, Jim Goldberg, Leigh Ledare, Boris Mikhailov, Anders Petersen and Annelies Strba.

The devices were designed and manufactured by an alliance, which included Sun Microsystems, IBM, and others. The devices were designed with minimum specifications, based on the Network Computer Reference Profile. The brand was also employed as a marketing term to try to popularize this design of computer within enterprise and among consumers. The NC brand was mainly intended to inspire a range of desktop computers from various suppliers that, by virtue of their diskless design and use of inexpensive components and software, were cheaper and easier to manage than standard fat client desktops. However, due to the commoditization of standard desktop components, and due to the increasing availability and popularity of various software options for using full desktops as diskless nodes, thin clients, and hybrid clients, the Network Computer brand never achieved the popularity hoped for by Oracle and was eventually mothballed. The term \\"network computer\\" is now used for any diskless desktop computer or a thin client. History  The failure of the NC to impact on the scale predicted by Larry Ellison may have been caused by a number of factors. Firstly, prices of PCs quickly fell below $1000, making the competition very hard. Secondly, the software available for NCs was neither mature nor open. Thirdly, the idea could simply have been ahead of its time, as at the NC's launch in 1996, the typical home Internet connection was only a 28.8 kbit/s modem dialup. This was simply insufficient for the delivery of executable content. The world wide web itself was not considered mainstream until its breakout year, 1998. Prior to this, very few Internet service providers advertised in mainstream press (at least outside of the US), and knowledge of the Internet was limited. This could have held back uptake of what would be seen as a very niche device with no (then) obvious appeal. NCs ended up being used as the very 'dumb terminals' they were intended to replace, as the proprietary backend infrastructure is not readily available. 1990s era NCs are often network-booted into a minimal Unix with X, to serve as X terminals. While NC purists may consider this to be a suboptimal use of NC hardware, the NCs work well as terminals, and are considerably cheaper than purpose-built terminal hardware. NC standards and drafts Reference Profile The initial Network Computing standard, the Network Computer Reference Profile (NCRef), required that all 'NC' appliances supported HTML, Java, HTTP, JPEG, and other key standards. Other standards Because many NCs did not use Intel CPUs or Microsoft software, Microsoft and Intel developed a competing standard called NetPC.Cheaper Computing, Part I , Byte magazine, April 1997 Other alternatives to the NCRef were WeBRef (Motorola and HDS Network Systems) and Odin (National Semiconductor). The HDS @workStation was stated to ship by the end of June 1996. NC extensions NC implementations Acorn Network Computer An Acorn NetStation NC The Acorn Network Computer was Oracle's initial reference implementation of the NC. Its development was subcontracted to British company Acorn Computers, who adapted its own to create NCOS. Acorn made use of local partner companies ANT, Icon Technology and Design Edge to fulfil their contract. Macintosh NC In 1997 Apple announced the Mac NC, its attempt to develop the Pippin into a network computer platform. By the end of 1997, Steve Jobs discontinued all Macintosh clone efforts, effectively killing the Pippin, although key components of the Mac NC technology were inherited by the original iMac. NetProducts NetStation The first generation NetStation design and the NetStation trademark was licensed to NChannel, which provided the consumer equipment and Internet service (with associated infrastructure) for the UK market. After a few months, NChannel split into two entities: NetChannel (which provided the Internet service) and NetProducts which provided the consumer hardware. NetProducts started working with Acorn to develop a next-generation product, NetStation II and started developing an email-only set-top-box (the TVemail). NetProducts went into voluntary liquidation in 1998 before either project was completed. Sun Microsystems JavaStation Sun Microsystems developed the JavaStation, a JavaOS-based NC based on SPARC hardware, initially similar to Sun's range of Unix workstations. IBM Network Station IBM launched its Network Station in September 1996. As with the later reference design, the Network Station used a NetBSD-based NCOS booted over a LAN from an AS/400 or IBM PC server. The Network Station supported local execution of basic applications, such as a web browser and console. In addition, X capability was also implemented to allow both locally and remotely run applications to be used on the same machine. In practice, the lack of real applications meant that this was little more than a hardware X terminal. The IBM Network Station was originally based on the PowerPC architecture, but the final few models used Intel Pentium processors. Contemporary analogy Some see the idea behind the NC as existing in contemporary times in the system of cloud computing and in particular Google Chrome OS. In Wired magazine, Daniel Roth claims that the failure of the network computer eventually led to the development of cloud computing. A large contribution to this transition was attributed to Eric Schmidt, once the CTO of Sun Microsystems, a proponent of the network computer, who eventually became the CEO of Google. Google is a large purveyor of cloud technology, \\"most notably Google Docs and Spreadsheets\\".Roth, Daniel. \\"Time Your Attack: Oracle's Lost Revolution\\", Wired, 2009-12-21.

The protocol lays down a specification for passing data between server and clients, but is not bound to any one platform. Citrix's ICA is an alternative to Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). Practical products conforming to ICA are Citrix's WinFrame, Citrix XenApp (formerly called MetaFrame/Presentation Server), and Citrix XenDesktop products. These permit ordinary Windows applications to be run on a suitable Windows server, and for any supported client to gain access to those applications. Besides Windows, ICA is also supported on a number of Unix server platforms and can be used to deliver access to applications running on these platforms. The client platforms need not run Windows; for example, there are clients for Mac, Unix, Linux, and various smartphones. ICA client software is also built into various thin client platforms. ICA is broadly similar in purpose to window servers such as the X Window System. It also provides for the feedback of user input from the client to the server, and a variety of means for the server to send graphical output, as well as other media such as audio, from the running application to the client. Key challenges of such an architecture are network latency and performance—a graphically intensive application (as most are when presented using a GUI) being served over a slow or bandwidth-restricted network connection requires considerable compression and optimization to render the application usable by the client. The client machine may be a different platform, and may not have the same GUI routines available locally—in this case the server may need to send the actual bitmap data over the connection. Depending on the client's capabilities, servers may also off-load part of the graphical processing to the client, e.g. to render multimedia content. ICA runs natively over TCP port 1494 or may be encapsulated in Common Gateway Protocol (CGP) on TCP 2598. ICA supports the concept of channels at a session layer to encapsulate rich media redirection or USB extension within ICA.

His 1995 memoir of childhood abuse, A Child Called \\"It\\", was listed on The New York Times Bestseller List for several years, and in 5 years had sold at least 1.6 million copies. The book has also been a source of controversy for Pelzer, with accusations of several events being fabricated coming from both family members and journalists. Biography Pelzer was born in San Francisco, California the second of five boys. He grew up in Daly City, California. He is the son of Catherine Roerva Christen Pelzer (1929-1992) and San Francisco fireman Stephen Joseph Pelzer (1923-1980). Pelzer's books describe the abuse he suffered for several years of childhood, including continual mistreatment and beatings by his mother, who he said thought of it as a game. His teachers stepped in on March 5, 1973, when 12-year-old Pelzer was placed in foster care. At age 18 he joined the U.S. Air Force in 1979 and served in the Gulf War.Dave Pelzer website bioPR Web news article In the 1980s Pelzer married his first wife Patsy (a pseudonym), with whom he had a son. In 1996 he carried a torch in the 1996 Summer Olympics torch relay. Pelzer and Patsy divorced and many years later he married his second wife, Marsha, who was his editor. Abuse His book A Child Called \\"It\\" describes from his viewpoint the severe abuse he suffered as a child. He writes how his mother was physically and emotionally abusive towards him from ages 4 to 12. He describes how his mom starved him, forced him to drink ammonia, stabbed him in the stomach, burned his arm on a gas stove, and forced him to eat his own vomit. He mentioned that his father was not active in resolving or stopping the conflicts between Pelzer and his alcoholic mother. He was sent to a foster family at age 12 in 1973. In the book he refers to his relatives by pseudonyms. One of Dave's brothers, Richard B. Pelzer, published his own autobiography, A Brother's Journey, that detailed his experiences. Paraphrased, Pelzer said in the afterword of his book that his objectives for his story was to show how a parent can become abusive and how the human spirit can triumph and survive.  Books  Pelzer's first book, A Child Called \\"It\\" was published in 1995 and describes the abuse Pelzer suffered in his childhood. His second book, The Lost Boy: A Foster Child's Search for the Love of a Family was published shortly after in 1997. The book covered Pelzer's teen years. The third book in his series, A Man Named Dave: A Story of Triumph and ForgivenessPelzer, Dave (1999) \\"A Man Named Dave: A Story of Triumph and Forgiveness\\" Published by Penguin Group; 1999, New York. (hc.), (pbk. 339 pp). was about Pelzer's experiences as an adult and how he forgave his father. In 2001 he wrote Help Yourself: Finding Hope, Courage, And Happiness which was a self-help book. When discussing his seventh book Moving Forward he said, \\"My message has always been about resilience\\". Reception of A Child Called \\"It\\" His first book, A Child Called It, was successful and garnered interest. It was listed on The New York Times Bestseller List for several years and in five years had sold at least 1.6 million copies. Pelzer was invited to television shows such as The Montel Williams Show and The Oprah Winfrey Show to give interviews after the book was published. In a 2001 news article Orion UK Publishing's Trevor Dolby said, \\"We get 10 letters a day from people saying the first book mirrors their own childhood, which is very depressing.\\" One reader was quoted: \\"(The book) made me see that I wasn't the only one out there...that had this...in their life. That there's people who do understand.\\" Writer David Plotz criticized Pelzer in an article he wrote for Slate. In the article Plotz says that because Pelzer's parents are dead it is hard to question them. Controversy In a 2002 The New York Times article by Pat Jordan the author questioned the reliability of Pelzer's recollections. He said that \\"Pelzer has an exquisite recall of his abuse, but almost no recall of anything that would authenticate that abuse\\", such as any details about his mother. Two members of his family, his maternal grandmother and brother, have disputed his book. One of his younger brothers, Stephen, denies that any abuse took place, and says that he thinks David was placed in foster care because \\"he started a fire and was caught shoplifting\\". However, his other brother Richard Pelzer is author of the book A Brother's Journey, which affirms much of what David has said and describes his own abuse when David was finally removed from the home. In regard to this, Dave has said that Stephen had affection towards his mother and that \\"he misses her terribly because she protected him\\". Due to the criticism from The New York Times article Dave does not give interviews often. In an article in The Boston Globe Pelzer's grandmother said she believed Dave had been abused but not as severely as he described. She also said she didn't believe his brother Richard was abused. It was revealed, however, that Pelzer's grandmother did not live in the same state as his brothers and family and was not in contact with them when the abuse happened. An article in The Guardian notes that gaps in the background narrative \\"makes the foreground harder to trust\\". The author writes, \\"My own hunch is that, substantially, he's telling the truth ... But there is a definite feeling of exaggeration in the later two books...\\" The author then states the same feeling Plotz also covered in his article, that she feels Pelzer is profiting from his abuse and minimizing the seriousness of the crime by making the writing \\"entertaining\\". Current life Pelzer spends his time giving lectures across the country. He is also a volunteer.

When he was 17 years old he worked as an auxiliary in a Bethel Institution. In 1910 he earned his Abitur in Leipzig and then started studying medicine and philosophy and—later—history of art. He volunteered for the army in 1914. In 1918 he settled down in Allmannshausen (part of Berg) at the Starnberger See. Early work His early work is influenced by Expressionism. Examples include Der Anfang (The Beginning) (1917) and Der König (The King) (1920). Later, he turned to a naturalist philosophy in plays such as Wechsler und Händler (Money changers and Traders) (1923) and Thomas Paine (1927). Bertolt Brecht's first play Baal was written in response to Johst's play Der Einsame (The Lonely), a dramatization of the life of playwright Christian Dietrich Grabbe. In 1928 Johst joined Alfred Rosenberg's \\"Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur\\" (Militant League for German Culture) designed to combat Jewish influence in German culture. In 1932 he joined the National Socialist German Workers Party, explaining his agreement with Hitler's ideology in the essay \\"Standpunkt und Fortschritt\\" (\\"Standpoint and Progress\\") in 1933. Schlageter When the Nazis achieved power in 1933, Johst wrote the play Schlageter, an expression of Nazi ideology which was performed on Hitler's 44th birthday, 20 April 1933, to celebrate his victory. It was a heroic biography of the proto-Nazi martyr Albert Leo Schlageter. The famous line \\"When I hear the word culture, I reach for my gun\\", often associated with Nazi leaders, derives from this play. The actual line in the play is, however, slightly different: \\"Wenn ich Kultur höre … entsichere ich meinen Browning!\\" \\"When I hear 'Culture'... I release the safety catch on my Browning!\\" (Act 1, Scene 1). It is spoken by another character in conversation with the young Schlageter. In the scene Schlageter and his wartime comrade Friedrich Thiemann are studying for a college examination, but then start debating whether it is worthwhile doing so when the nation is not free. Thiemann argues that he would prefer to fight rather than study. The line is frequently misattributed, sometimes to Hermann Göring and sometimes to Heinrich Himmler. In December 2007, historian David Starkey misattributed it to Joseph Goebbels in comments criticizing Queen Elizabeth II for being \\"poorly educated and philistine\\".Queen is poorly educated and philistine, says Starkey  UK news  The Guardian It has also been adapted by, for example Stephen Hawking as \\"When I hear of Schrödinger's cat, I reach for my pistol\\" and by filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard in his 1963 film Le Mépris, when a producer says to Fritz Lang: \\"Whenever I hear the word culture, I bring out my checkbook.\\" Lang evokes the original line when he answers \\"Some years ago—some horrible years ago—the Nazis used to take out a pistol instead of a checkbook.\\" Songwriter Clint Conley of Mission of Burma titled a song he wrote in 1981 \\"That's When I Reach for My Revolver\\". Role in Nazi Germany Johst receives a literary prize from Alfred Rosenberg In 1933, Johst signed the Gelöbnis treuester Gefolgschaft, a declaration of loyalty to Hitler by pro- Nazi writers.88 \\"writers\\", from Letters of Heinrich and Thomas Mann, 1900–1949, Volume 12 of Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism, University of California Press 1998 , p. 367–8 Succeeding Hans-Friedrich Blunck in 1935, Johst became the President of the Reichsschrifttumskammer (writer's union) and of the Deutsche Akademie für Dichtung (poetry academy), powerful organisations for German writers. In the same year the last prominent Jewish writers, e.g. Martin Buber, were expelled from the Reichsschrifttumskammer. By this time these organisations restricted membership to writers whose work was either explicitly pro-Nazi or at least approved of by the Nazis as non-degenerate. Johst achieved other positions of importance within the Nazi state, and he was named in the Gottbegnadeten list of September 1944 as one of the Reich's most important artists. During the war he held various positions within the SS, which Thomas Mann stated was the reason that several charges of pedophilia and abuse of children were dropped against Johst in the winter of 1944.88 \\"writers\\", from Letters of Heinrich and Thomas Mann, 1900–1949, Volume 12 of Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism, University of California Press 1998 , p. 367–8 Quotations Post-war After the war, Johst was interned by the Allies. In 1949, he was tried for his activities and imprisoned for three and a half years. On his release he was unable to re-establish his career as a writer, being banned from writing for ten years.

The subject of the work is psychoactive phenethylamine chemical derivatives, notably those that act as psychedelics and/or empathogen-entactogens. The main title, PiHKAL, is an acronym that stands for \\"Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved\\". The book is arranged into two parts, the first part being a fictionalized autobiography of the couple and the second part describing 179 different psychedelic compounds (most of which Shulgin discovered himself), including detailed synthesis instructions, bioassays, dosages, and other commentary. The second part was made freely available by Shulgin on Erowid while the first part is available only in the printed text. While the reactions described are beyond the ability of people with a basic chemistry education, some tend to emphasize techniques that do not require difficult-to-obtain chemicals. Notable among these are the use of mercury-aluminum amalgam (an unusual but easy to obtain reagent) as a reducing agent and detailed suggestions on legal plant sources of important drug precursors such as safrole.  Impact and popularity  Through PIHKAL (and later TIHKAL), Shulgin sought to ensure that his discoveries would escape the limits of professional research labs and find their way to the public, a goal consistent with his stated beliefs that psychedelic drugs can be valuable tools for self-exploration. The MDMA (\\"ecstasy\\") synthesis published in PIHKAL remains one of the most common clandestine methods of its manufacture to this day. Many countries have banned the major substances for which this book gives directions for synthesis, such as 2C-B, 2C-T-2, and 2C-T-7. In the United Kingdom, all but phenethylamine are illegal. In 1994, two years after PIHKAL was published, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) raided Shulgin's lab and requested that he turn over his DEA license. Richard Meyer, spokesman for DEA's San Francisco Field Division, has stated in reference to PIHKAL \\"It is our opinion that those books are pretty much cookbooks on how to make illegal drugs. Agents tell me that in clandestine labs that they have raided, they have found copies of those books,\\" suggesting that the publication of PIHKAL and the termination of Shulgin's license may have been related.  Notable compounds   Essential amphetamines  The \\"Essential Amphetamines\\" are what Shulgin describes as ten amphetamines that differ from natural products such as safrole or myristicin by an amine group (PIHKAL Entry #157 TMA). The list consists of: * PMA (para-methoxy-amphetamine) * 2,4-DMA (2,4-dimethoxy- amphetamine) * 3,4-DMA (3,4-dimethoxy-amphetamine) * MDA (3,4-methylenedioxy- amphetamine) * MMDA (3-methoxy-4,5-methylendioxy-amphetamine) * MMDA-3a (2-methoxy-3,4-methylendioxyamphetamine) * MMDA-2 (2-methoxy-4,5-methylendioxyamphetamine) * TMA (3,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine) * TMA-2 (2,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine) * DMMDA (2,5-dimethoxy-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine) * DMMDA-2 (2,3-dimethoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine) * TeMA (2,3,4,5-tetramethoxyamphetamine) Not all of these chemicals are bioassayed in PIHKAL, some are merely mentioned.  Magical half-dozen  The so-called \\"magical half-dozen\\" refers to Shulgin's self-rated most important phenethylamine compounds, all of which except mescaline he developed and synthesized himself. They are found within the first book of PIHKAL, and are as follows: * Mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine) * DOM (2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine), DOM being short for desoxy methyl, referring to the removal of the Oxygen atom from the Methoxy group on the \\"4\\" carbon. * 2C-B (2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine) * 2C-E (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine) * 2C-T-2 (2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthiophenethylamine) * 2C-T-7 (2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylthiophenethylamine) All six are now Schedule I controlled substances in the United States.

He has been awarded the Overseas Press Club's Robert Capa Gold Medal five times and two World Press Photo awards. In 2003, Nachtwey was injured in a grenade attack on his convoy while working in Baghdad, from which he made a full recovery. Nachtwey has worked with Time as a contract photographer since 1984. He worked for Black Star (1980–1985), was a member of Magnum Photos (1986–2001) and VII Photo Agency (2001–2011) where he was a founding member.  Life and work  Nachtwey grew up in Massachusetts and graduated from Dartmouth College, where he studied art history and political science (1966–70). He started working as a newspaper photographer in 1976 at the Albuquerque Journal. In 1980, he moved to New York and began working as a freelance photographer. In 1981, he covered his first assignment in Northern Ireland illustrating civil strife. He has documented a variety of armed conflicts and social issues, spending time in South Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, Russia, Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union shooting pictures of war, conflict and images of socio-political issues in Western Europe and the United States. He is not married and currently lives in New York City. In 1994, Nachtwey was covering the upcoming elections in South Africa, the first non-racial ones in decades. As an associate of the Bang-Bang Club, he was at the scene when Ken Oosterbroek was killed and Greg Marinovich was seriously injured. Nachtwey had been injured previously in his work, but it was during his extensive coverage of the United States invasion of Iraq that he received his first combat injury. As Nachtwey, along with Time correspondent Michael Weisskopf rode in the back of a Humvee with the United States Army \\"Tomb Raiders\\" Survey Platoon, an insurgent threw a grenade into the vehicle. Weisskopf grabbed the grenade to throw it out of the humvee: two soldiers were injured in the explosion, along with the Time journalists. Nachtwey managed to take several photographs of medic Billie Grimes treating Weisskopf before passing out. Both journalists were airlifted to Germany and later to hospitals in the United States. Nachtwey recovered sufficiently to return overseas to cover the tsunami in Southeast Asia of December 26, 2004. Nachtwey has worked with Time as a contract photographer since 1984. He worked for Black Star from 1980 until 1985 and was a member of Magnum Photos from 1986 until 2001. In 2001, he was a founding member of the VII Photo Agency (he disassociated from VII in August 2011). Nachtwey was present during the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, and produced a well known related body of work. He also compiled a photo essay on the effects of the Sudan conflict on civilians. In 2001, the documentary War Photographer was released, focusing on Nachtwey and his work. Directed by Christian Frei, the film received an Academy Award nomination for best documentary film. On February 1, 2014, Nachtwey was grazed by a bullet while photographing political protests in Thailand.http://www.miamiherald.com/2014/02/01/3906382/fear-of-violence-grips- thai-capital.html Nachtwey is one of three winners of the 2007 TED Prize. Each recipient was granted $100,000 and one \\"world-changing wish\\" to be revealed at the 2007 TED conference, in Monterey, California. Many members of the TED Community, and a group of world-class companies, have pledged support to help fulfill the wishes. Nachtwey's wish, revealed March 8, 2007, is this: \\"There's a vital story that needs to be told, and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era.\\" Those who wish to help him will sign a Non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and help him \\"gain access to a place in the world where a critical situation is occurring and fully document it with photography; set a date to unveil the pictures and find a series of innovative ways to create powerful impact with them, using novel display technologies and the power of the Internet as well as media; and use the campaign to generate resources for organizations that are working to address and transform the situation.\\" Early results of this work have been unveiled at XDRTB.org to document extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis throughout the world.

This drag force occurs in airplanes due to wings or a lifting body redirecting air to cause lift and also in cars with airfoil wings that redirect air to cause a downforce. Samuel Langley observed higher aspect ratio flat plates had higher lift and lower drag and stated in 1902 “A plane of fixed size and weight would need less propulsive power the faster it flew”, the counter-intuitive effect of induced drag. Source of induced drag Induced drag is related to the amount of induced downwash in the vicinity of the wing. The grey vertical line labeled \\"L\\" is perpendicular to the free stream and indicates the orientation of the lift on the wing. The red vector labeled \\"Leff\\" is perpendicular to the actual airflow in the vicinity of the wing; it represents the lift on the airfoil section in two–dimensional flow at the same angle of attack. The lift generated by the wing has been tilted rearwards through an angle equal to the angle of the downwash in three-dimensional flow. The component of \\"Leff\\" parallel to the free stream is the induced drag on the wing.Hurt, H. H. (1965) Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators, Figure 1.30, NAVWEPS 00-80T-80Clancy, L.J. (1975) Aerodynamics Fig 5.24. Pitman Publishing Limited, London. Kermode, A.C. (1972). Mechanics of Flight, Figure 3.29, Ninth edition. Longman Scientific & Technical, England. The total aerodynamic force acting on a body is usually thought of as having two components, lift and drag. By definition, the component of force parallel to the oncoming flow is called drag; and the component perpendicular to the oncoming flow is called lift.Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, Section 5.3 At practical angles of attack the lift greatly exceeds the drag.Abbott, Ira H., and Von Doenhoff, Albert E., Theory of Wing Sections, Section 1.2 and Appendix IV Lift is produced by the changing direction of the flow around a wing. The change of direction results in a change of velocity (even if there is no speed change, just as seen in uniform circular motion), which is an acceleration. To change the direction of the flow therefore requires that a force be applied to the fluid; lift is simply the reaction force of the fluid acting on the wing. To produce lift, air below the wing is at a higher pressure than the air pressure above the wing. On a wing of finite span, this pressure difference causes air to flow from the lower surface wing root, around the wingtip, towards the upper surface wing root. This spanwise flow of air combines with chordwise flowing air, causing a change in speed and direction, which twists the airflow and produces vortices along the wing trailing edge. The vortices created are unstable, and they quickly combine to produce wingtip vortices.Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, Section 5.14 The resulting vortices change the speed and direction of the airflow behind the trailing edge, deflecting it downwards, and thus inducing downwash behind the wing. Wingtip vortices modify the airflow around a wing, reducing wing's ability to generate lift, so that it requires a higher angle of attack for the same lift, which tilts the total aerodynamic force rearwards and increases the drag component of that force. The angular deflection is small and has little effect on the lift. However, there is an increase in the drag equal to the product of the lift force and the angle through which it is deflected. Since the deflection is itself a function of the lift, the additional drag is proportional to the square of the lift.Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, Section 5.17 Reducing induced drag According to the equations below, a wing of infinite aspect ratio (wingspan/chord length) and constant airfoil section would produce no induced drag. The characteristics of such a wing can be measured on a section of wing spanning the width of a wind tunnel, since the walls block spanwise flow and create what is effectively two-dimensional flow. A rectangular planform wing produces stronger wingtip vortices than does a tapered or elliptical wing, therefore many modern wings are tapered. However, an elliptical planform is more efficient as the induced downwash (and therefore the effective angle of attack) is constant across the whole of the wingspan. Few aircraft have this planform because of manufacturing complications — the most famous examples being the World War II Spitfire and Thunderbolt. Tapered wings with straight leading and trailing edges can approximate to elliptical lift distribution. Typically, straight edged non-tapered wings produce 5%, and tapered wings produce 1-2% more induced drag than an elliptical wing.Glauert, H. The Elements of Aerofoil and Airscrew Theory (1926); referenced in Fig. 5.4 of Airplane Aerodynamics by Daniel O. Dommasch, Sydney S. Sherby, Thomas F. Connolly, 3rd ed. (1961) Similarly, for a given wing area, a high aspect ratio wing will produce less induced drag than a wing of low aspect ratio because there is less air disturbance at the tip of a longer, thinner wing. Induced drag can therefore be said to be inversely proportional to aspect ratio.More correctly stated, induced drag is inversely proportional to the square of the wingspan. The lift distribution may also be modified by the use of washout, a spanwise twist of the wing to reduce the incidence towards the wingtips, and by changing the airfoil section near the wingtips. This allows more lift to be generated nearer the wing root and less towards the wingtip, which causes a reduction in the strength of the wingtip vortices. Some early aircraft had fins mounted on the tips of the tailplane which served as endplates. More recent aircraft have wingtip mounted winglets to reduce the intensity of wingtip vortices. Wingtip mounted fuel tanks may also provide some benefit by preventing the spanwise flow of air around the wingtip. Calculation of induced drag For a planar wing with an elliptical lift distribution, induced drag can be calculated as follows: :D_\\\\text{i} = \\\\frac{L^2}{\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho V^2 \\\\pi b^2}, where :L \\\\, is the lift, :\\\\rho \\\\, is the air density, :V \\\\, is the true airspeed, and :b \\\\, is the wingspan. From this equation it is clear that the induced drag decreases with flight speed and with wingspan. Deviation from the non-planar wing with elliptical lift distribution are taken into account by dividing the induced drag by the span efficiency factor e. To compare with other sources of drag, it can be convenient to express this equation in terms of lift and drag coefficientsAnderson, John D. (2005), Introduction to Flight, McGraw-Hill. . p318: :C_{D,\\\\text{i}} = \\\\frac{D_\\\\text{i}}{\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\rho V^2 S} = \\\\frac{C_L^2}{ \\\\pi A\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\text{R}} , where :C_L = \\\\frac{L}{ \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho V^2 S} and :A\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\text{R}=\\\\frac{b^2}{S} \\\\, is the aspect ratio, :S \\\\, is a reference wing area. This indicates how high aspect ratio wings are beneficial to flight efficiency. With C_L being a function of angle of attack, induced drag increases as the angle of attack increases. The above equation can be derived using Prandtl's lifting-line theory. Similar methods can also be used to compute the minimum induced drag for non-planar wings or for arbitrary lift distributions. Combined effect with other drag sources Total drag is parasitic drag plus induced drag Induced drag must be added to the parasitic drag to find the total drag. Since induced drag is inversely proportional to the square of the airspeed (at a given lift) whereas parasitic drag is proportional to the square of the airspeed, the combined overall drag curve shows a minimum at some airspeed - the minimum drag speed (VMD). An aircraft flying at this speed is operating at its optimal aerodynamic efficiency. According to the above equations, the speed for minimum drag occurs at the speed where the induced drag is equal to the parasitic drag.Clancy, L.J., Aerodynamics, Section 5.25 This is the speed at which for unpowered aircraft, optimum glide angle is achieved. This is also the speed for greatest range (although VMD will decrease as the plane consumes fuel and becomes lighter). The speed for greatest range (i.e., distance travelled) is the speed at which a straight line from the origin is tangent to the fuel flow rate curve. The curve of range versus airspeed is normally very flat and it is customary to operate at the speed for 99% best range since this gives about 5% greater speed for only 1% less range. (Of course, flying higher where the air is thinner will raise the speed at which minimum drag occurs, and so permits a faster voyage for the same amount of fuel. If the plane is flying at the maximum permissible speed, then there is an altitude at which the air density will be what is needed to keep it aloft while flying at the angle of attack that minimizes the drag. The optimum altitude at maximum speed, and the optimum speed at maximum altitude, may change during the flight as the plane becomes lighter.) The speed for maximum endurance (i.e., time in the air) is the speed for minimum fuel flow rate, and is less than the speed for greatest range. The fuel flow rate is calculated as the product of the power required and the engine specific fuel consumption (fuel flow rate per unit of powerThe engine specific fuel consumption is normally expressed in units of fuel flow rate per unit of thrust or per unit of power depending on whether the engine output is measured in thrust, as for a jet engine, or shaft horsepower, as for a propeller engine. To convert fuel rate per unit thrust to fuel rate per unit power one must divide by the speed.). The power required is equal to the drag times the speed.

The species lived on the island of Rodrigues, where it typically inhabited forests and dwelt in trees. The Rodrigues day gecko fed on insects and nectar. Etymology The specific name, edwardnewtoni, is in honor of British colonial administrator and ornithologist Edward Newton.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Phelsuma edwardnewtoni, p. 80). Taxonomy 1885 illustration The Rodrigues day gecko is now extinct. It was originally described as Phelsuma newtoni by Boulenger in 1884, also spelt Phelsuma newtonii by Boulenger in 1885. However, because this scientific name was also used as a synonym for Phelsuma gigas, Vinson & Vinson changed the specific name to edwardnewtoni in 1969. Description P. edwardnewtoni was one of the largest day geckos. It reached a total length (including tail) of about . Earlier investigators describe the animal as being quite common. However, this species has not been sighted since 1917, in spite of thorough searches in the 1960s and 1970s on Rodrigues and all offshore islets. Today, only five preserved specimens remain, three of which are in The Natural History Museum in London, the two others being in the Paris Natural History Museum. These specimens have been preserved in alcohol and show a thick-bodied, robust Phelsuma. The body colour has been described as bright green with bright blue spots on the back. The underside of the tail was whitish-yellow. The chin had a deep yellow colour. Behaviour and ecology The species Phelsuma edwardnewtoni inhabited Rodrigues Island and its surrounding islets. P. edwardnewtoni was observed on coconut trees and other palms. Its habitat has been largely destroyed by humans and introduced animals such as cats and rats, which may have been the main cause of its extinction. These day geckos fed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also liked to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar. P. edwardnewtoni was documented as being unafraid of humans. It was quite tame and would even eat fruit from one's hand. Leguat described the behaviour as follows: It can also be noted that the behavior of this species was most likely very similar to other island dwelling day geckos such as the Madagascar Giant Day Gecko and Standing's Day Gecko which share a very similar niche as this species.

It was renovated and revitalized in 1996 under the stewardship of the then Deputy Commissioner, Mr. M.G.V.K.Bhanu, IAS. It has water sports facility, walk ways, restaurant and open air stage. * Padum Pukhuri: This is a beautiful lake with an island. The island has been developed into a beautiful park with a musical fountain. There is an iron bridge to take you to the island. On the lake one can boat. * Trimurty Udyan: This is a park along Borpukhuri. This has been named after the three jewels of Assamese culture: Rupkowar Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla, Kalaguru Bishnu Prasad Rabha and Natasurjya Phani Sarmah. * Rudrapada Temple: To the east of Tezpur town, on the bank of river Brahmaputra the Rudrapada temple is situated. It is believed that Rudra ( Lord Shiva ) had left the print of his left foot (pada) on a stone found in the temple. It is believed that Mahadeva showed his real self to king Bana here. Rudrapada temple was later built by Siva Singha in the year 1730 A.D. The main temple was destroyed, due to erosion of river Brahmaputra. * Bhomoraguri: It is a mammoth stone inscription made by the Ahom General Kalia Bhomora Borphukan, who planned to construct a bridge over Brahmaputra. Almost two centuries later, a bridge at the same site now stands completed. The 3.015 km bridge, named after the great Ahom general, connects Silghat of Nagaon district with Tezpur. * Bamuni Hills: The ruins of Bamuni Hills are famous for their exemplary artistic finesse. The sculptural remains date back to the ninth and tenth century A.D. * The Hazara Pukhuri: It is a large tank in name of Harjar Varman in Tezpur. It was excavated in the early part of the 9th century.  Climate  The average temperature in summer is around while the average winter temperature is around .

As a war correspondent, Clark landed on Juno Beach with the Canadians on D-Day. He followed the war until the end, and remained in Germany to report on the major War Crimes trials. After returning to Britain in 1948, Clark embarked on a career as an author. He wrote extensively on subjects ranging from mountain climbing (over a dozen titles), the atomic bomb, Balmoral Castle, and world explorers, as well as novels of alternate history. He also wrote a number of biographies of a diverse range of historical figures, including: Charles Darwin, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Sigmund Freud, J. B. S. Haldane, V. I.

The term is particularly common in the computing and electronics industries, in circuit bending, as well as among players of video games. More generally, all types of systems including human organizations and nature experience glitches. A glitch, which is slight and often temporary, differs from a more serious bug which is a genuine functionality-breaking problem. Alex Pieschel, writing for Arcade Review, said: \\"“bug” is often cast as the weightier and more blameworthy pejorative, while “glitch” suggests something more mysterious and unknowable inflicted by surprise inputs or stuff outside the realm of code.\\" Etymology Some reference books, including Random House's American Slang, claim that the term comes from the German word glitschen (\\"to slip\\") and the Yiddish word gletshn (\\"to slide or skid\\"). Either way, it is a relatively new term. It was first widely defined for the American people by Bennett Cerf on the June 20, 1965 episode of What's My Line as \\"a kink... when anything goes wrong down there [Cape Kennedy], they say there's been a slight glitch.\\" Astronaut John Glenn explained the term in his section of the book Into Orbit, writing that > Another term we adopted to describe some of our problems was \\"glitch.\\" > Literally, a glitch is a spike or change in voltage in an electrical circuit > which takes place when the circuit suddenly has a new load put on it. You > have probably noticed a dimming of lights in your home when you turn a > switch or start the dryer or the television set. Normally, these changes in > voltage are protected by fuses. A glitch, however, is such a minute change > in voltage that no fuse could protect against it.quoted in Ben Zimmer, \\"The > Hidden History of Glitch,\\" visualthesarus.com John Daily further defined the word on the July 4, 1965, episode of the same show, saying that it's a term used by the Air Force at Cape Kennedy, in the process of launching rockets, \\"it means something's gone wrong and you can't figure out what it is so you call it a 'glitch'.\\" Later, on July 23, 1965, Time Magazine felt it necessary to define it in an article: \\"Glitches—a spaceman's word for irritating disturbances.\\" In relation to the reference by Time Magazine, the term has been believed to enter common usage during the American Space Race of the 1950s, where it was used to describe minor faults in the rocket hardware that were difficult to pinpoint. Electronics glitch An electronics glitch or logic hazard is a transition that occurs on a signal before the signal settles to its intended value, particularly in a digital circuit. Generally, this implies an electrical pulse of short duration, often due to a race condition between two signals derived from a common source but with different delays. In some cases, such as a well-timed synchronous circuit, this could be a harmless and well-tolerated effect that occurs normally in a design. In other contexts, a glitch can represent an undesirable result of a fault or design error that can produce a malfunction. Some electronic components, such as flip-flops, are triggered by a pulse that must not be shorter than a specified minimum duration in order to function correctly; a pulse shorter than the specified minimum may be called a glitch. A related concept is the runt pulse, a pulse whose amplitude is smaller than the minimum level specified for correct operation, and a spike, a short pulse similar to a glitch but often caused by ringing or crosstalk. Computer glitch A computer glitch is the failure of a system, usually containing a computing device, to complete its functions or to perform them properly. In public declarations, glitch is used to suggest a minor fault which will soon be rectified and is therefore used as a euphemism for a bug, which is a factual statement that a programming fault is to blame for a system failure. It frequently refers to an error which is not detected at the time it occurs but shows up later in data errors or incorrect human decisions. Situations which are frequently called computer glitches are incorrectly written software (software bugs), incorrect instructions given by the operator (operator errors, and a failure to account for this possibility might also be considered a software bug), undetected invalid input data (this might also be considered a software bug), undetected communications errors, computer viruses, Trojan attacks and computer exploiting (sometimes called \\"hacking\\"). Such glitches could produce problems such as keyboard malfunction, number key failures, screen abnormalities (turned left, right or upside-down), random program malfunctions, and abnormal program registering. Examples of computer glitches causing disruption include an unexpected shutdown of a water filtration plant in New Canaan, 2010, failures in the Computer Aided Dispatch system used by the police in Austin, resulting in unresponded 911 calls, and an unexpected bit flip causing the Cassini spacecraft to enter \\"safe mode\\" in November 2010. Glitches can also be costly: in 2015, a bank was unable to raise interest rates for weeks resulting in losses of more than a million dollars per day. Video game glitches The start-up screen of the Virtual Boy is affected by a visual glitch Glitches/bugs are software errors that can cause drastic problems within the code, and typically go unnoticed or unsolved during the production of said software. These errors can be game caused or otherwise exploited until a developer/development team repairs them with patches. Complex software is rarely bug-free or otherwise free from errors upon first release. Texture/model glitches are a kind of bug or other error that causes any specific model or texture to either become distorted or otherwise to not look as intended by the developers. Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is notorious for texture glitches, as well as other errors that affect many of the company's popular titles. Many games that use ragdoll physics for their character models can have such glitches happen to them. Physics glitches are errors in a game's physics engine that causes a specific entity, be it a physics object or an NPC (Non-Player Character), to be unintentionally moved to some degree. These kinds of errors can be exploited, unlike many. The chance of a physics error happening can either be entirely random or accidentally caused. Sound glitches are where there is an error with the game's sound. These can range from sounds playing when not intended to play or even not playing at all. Occasionally, a certain sound will loop or otherwise the player will be given the option to continuously play the sound when not intended. Often, games will play sounds incorrectly due to corrupt data altering the values predefined in the code. Examples include, but are not limited to, extremely high or low pitched sounds, volume being mute or too high to understand, and also rarely even playing in reverse order/playing reversed. Glitches such as MissingNo. from Pokemon may include incorrectly displayed graphics, collision detection errors, game freezes/crashes, sound errors, and other issues. Graphical glitches are especially notorious in platforming games, where malformed textures can directly affect gameplay (for example, by displaying a ground texture where the code calls for an area that should damage the character, or by not displaying a wall texture where there should be one, resulting in an invisible wall). Some glitches are potentially dangerous to the game's stored data. \\"Glitching\\" is the practice of players exploiting faults in a video game's programming to achieve tasks that give them an unfair advantage in the game, over NPC's or other players, such as running through walls or defying the game's physics. Glitches can be deliberately induced in certain home video game consoles by manipulating the game medium, such as tilting a ROM cartridge to disconnect one or more connections along the edge connector and interrupt part of the flow of data between the cartridge and the console. This can result in graphic, music, or gameplay errors. Doing this, however, carries the risk of crashing the game or even causing permanent damage to the game medium. Heavy use of glitches are often used in performing a speedrun of a video game. One type of glitch often used for speedrunning is a stack overflow, which is referred to as \\"overflowing.\\" Another type of speedrunning glitch, which is almost impossible to do by humans and is mostly made use of in tool assisted speedruns, is arbitrary code execution which will cause an object in a game to do something outside of its intended function. Part of the quality assurance process (as performed by game testers for video games) is locating and reproducing glitches, and then compiling reports on the glitches to be fed back to the programmers so that they can repair the bugs. Certain games have a cloud-type system for updates to the software that can be used to repair coding faults and other errors in the games. Glitches can also be found in electronic toys. For example, in 2013, Hasbro released a game called Bop It Beats. It was discovered by several players that the DJ Expert and Lights Only modes have a bug that will give players a fail sound upon reaching a pattern with six actions and completing them successfully. The more difficult DJ modes can be completed in the Party mode as long as there is a \\"Pass It\\" on the last few patterns. Hasbro was informed about this glitch but as it was discovered after manufacture, they can no longer update or upgrade existing units. Foreign versions of the game, however, were shipped with this glitch already patched. Glitches in games should not be confused with exploits. Despite them both performing unintended actions, an exploit is not a programming error, but instead an oversight by the developers. (Ex. Bunny hopping or Lag Exploits) Television glitch In broadcasting, a corrupted signal may glitch in the form of jagged lines on the screen, misplaced squares, static looking effects, freezing problems, or inverted colors. The glitches may affect the video and/or audio (usually audio dropout) or the transmission. These glitches may be caused by a variety of issues, interference from portable electronics or microwaves, damaged cables at the broadcasting center, or weather. In popular culture Multiple works of popular culture deal with glitches; those with the word \\"glitch\\" or derivations thereof are detailed in Glitch (disambiguation). *The nonfiction book CB Bible (1976) includes glitch in its glossary of citizens band radio slang, defining it as \\"an indefinable technical defect in CB equipment\\", indicating the term was already then in use on citizens band. *The short film The Glitch (2008), opening film and best science fiction finalist at Dragon Con Independent Film Festival 2008, deals with the disorientation of late-night TV viewer Harry Owen (Scott Charles Blamphin), who experiences 'heavy brain-splitting digital breakdowns.'

Such winds are sometimes also called fall winds; the spelling catabatic winds is also used. Katabatic winds can rush down elevated slopes at hurricane speeds, but most are not as intense as that, and many are 10 knots (18 km/h) or less. Not all downslope winds are katabatic. For instance, winds such as the föhn and chinook are rain shadow winds where air driven upslope on the windward side of a mountain range drops its moisture and descends leeward drier and warmer. Examples of true katabatic winds include the bora in the Adriatic, the Bohemian Wind or Böhmwind in the Ore Mountains, the Santa Ana in southern California, the piteraq winds of Greenland, and the oroshi in Japan. Another example is \\"the Barber\\", an enhanced katabatic wind that blows over the town of Greymouth in New Zealand when there is a southeast flow over the South Island. \\"The Barber\\" has a local reputation for its coldness.  Theory  Sketch of the generation of katabatic winds in Antarctica A katabatic wind originates from radiational cooling of air atop a plateau, a mountain, glacier, or even a hill. Since the density of air is inversely proportional to temperature, the air will flow downwards, warming approximately adiabatically as it descends. The temperature of the air depends on the temperature in the source region and the amount of descent. In the case of the Santa Ana, for example, the wind can (but does not always) become hot by the time it reaches sea level. In Antarctica, by contrast, the wind is still intensely cold. The entire near-surface wind field over Antarctica is largely determined by the katabatic winds, particularly outside the summer season, except in coastal regions when storms may impose their own wind field.  Impacts  Coastal polynyas are produced in the Antarctic by katabatic winds Katabatic winds are most commonly found blowing out from the large and elevated ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland. The buildup of high density cold air over the ice sheets and the elevation of the ice sheets brings into play enormous gravitational energy. Where these winds are concentrated into restricted areas in the coastal valleys, the winds blow well over hurricane force,Climate: The South Pole Stanford Humanities Lab , Retrieved 2008-10-01 reaching around .Trewby, M. (Ed., 2002): Antarctica. An encyclopedia from Abbott Ice Shelf to Zooplankton Firefly Books Ltd. In Greenland these winds are called piteraq and are most intense whenever a low pressure area approaches the coast. In a few regions of continental Antarctica the snow is scoured away by the force of the katabatic winds, leading to \\"dry valleys\\" (or \\"Antarctic oases\\") such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. Since the katabatic winds are descending, they tend to have a low relative humidity, which desiccates the region. Other regions may have a similar but lesser effect, leading to \\"blue ice\\" areas where the snow is removed and the surface ice sublimates, but is replenished by glacier flow from upstream. In the Fuegian Archipelago (Tierra del Fuego) in South America as well as in Alaska in North America, a wind known as a williwaw is a particular danger to harboring vessels. Williwaws originate in the snow and ice fields of the coastal mountains, and they can be faster than .Williwaw weatheronline.co.uk. Accessed 2013-04-29.

Credit default options on single credits are extinguished upon default without any cashflows, other than the upfront premium paid by the buyer of the option. Therefore, buying a payer option is not a good protection against an actual default, only against a rise in the credit spread. This may explain why such options are very illiquid.

The term parsing comes from Latin pars (orationis), meaning part (of speech). The term has slightly different meanings in different branches of linguistics and computer science. Traditional sentence parsing is often performed as a method of understanding the exact meaning of a sentence or word, sometimes with the aid of devices such as sentence diagrams. It usually emphasizes the importance of grammatical divisions such as subject and predicate. Within computational linguistics the term is used to refer to the formal analysis by a computer of a sentence or other string of words into its constituents, resulting in a parse tree showing their syntactic relation to each other, which may also contain semantic and other information (p-values). Some parsing algorithms may generate a parse forest or list of parse trees for a syntactically ambiguous input. The term is also used in psycholinguistics when describing language comprehension. In this context, parsing refers to the way that human beings analyze a sentence or phrase (in spoken language or text) \\"in terms of grammatical constituents, identifying the parts of speech, syntactic relations, etc.\\" This term is especially common when discussing what linguistic cues help speakers to interpret garden-path sentences. Within computer science, the term is used in the analysis of computer languages, referring to the syntactic analysis of the input code into its component parts in order to facilitate the writing of compilers and interpreters. The term may also be used to describe a split or separation.  Human languages   Traditional methods  The traditional grammatical exercise of parsing, sometimes known as clause analysis, involves breaking down a text into its component parts of speech with an explanation of the form, function, and syntactic relationship of each part. This is determined in large part from study of the language's conjugations and declensions, which can be quite intricate for heavily inflected languages. To parse a phrase such as 'man bites dog' involves noting that the singular noun 'man' is the subject of the sentence, the verb 'bites' is the third person singular of the present tense of the verb 'to bite', and the singular noun 'dog' is the object of the sentence. Techniques such as sentence diagrams are sometimes used to indicate relation between elements in the sentence. Parsing was formerly central to the teaching of grammar throughout the English-speaking world, and widely regarded as basic to the use and understanding of written language. However, the general teaching of such techniques is no longer current.  Computational methods  In some machine translation and natural language processing systems, written texts in human languages are parsed by computer programs. Human sentences are not easily parsed by programs, as there is substantial ambiguity in the structure of human language, whose usage is to convey meaning (or semantics) amongst a potentially unlimited range of possibilities but only some of which are germane to the particular case. So an utterance \\"Man bites dog\\" versus \\"Dog bites man\\" is definite on one detail but in another language might appear as \\"Man dog bites\\" with a reliance on the larger context to distinguish between those two possibilities, if indeed that difference was of concern. It is difficult to prepare formal rules to describe informal behaviour even though it is clear that some rules are being followed. In order to parse natural language data, researchers must first agree on the grammar to be used. The choice of syntax is affected by both linguistic and computational concerns; for instance some parsing systems use lexical functional grammar, but in general, parsing for grammars of this type is known to be NP-complete. Head-driven phrase structure grammar is another linguistic formalism which has been popular in the parsing community, but other research efforts have focused on less complex formalisms such as the one used in the Penn Treebank. Shallow parsing aims to find only the boundaries of major constituents such as noun phrases. Another popular strategy for avoiding linguistic controversy is dependency grammar parsing. Most modern parsers are at least partly statistical; that is, they rely on a corpus of training data which has already been annotated (parsed by hand). This approach allows the system to gather information about the frequency with which various constructions occur in specific contexts. (See machine learning.) Approaches which have been used include straightforward PCFGs (probabilistic context-free grammars),Klein, Dan, and Christopher D. Manning. \\"Accurate unlexicalized parsing.\\" Proceedings of the 41st Annual Meeting on Association for Computational Linguistics-Volume 1.

Most of the more successful systems use lexical statistics (that is, they consider the identities of the words involved, as well as their part of speech). However such systems are vulnerable to overfitting and require some kind of smoothing to be effective. Parsing algorithms for natural language cannot rely on the grammar having 'nice' properties as with manually designed grammars for programming languages. As mentioned earlier some grammar formalisms are very difficult to parse computationally; in general, even if the desired structure is not context-free, some kind of context-free approximation to the grammar is used to perform a first pass. Algorithms which use context-free grammars often rely on some variant of the CYK algorithm, usually with some heuristic to prune away unlikely analyses to save time. (See chart parsing.) However some systems trade speed for accuracy using, e.g., linear-time versions of the shift-reduce algorithm. A somewhat recent development has been parse reranking in which the parser proposes some large number of analyses, and a more complex system selects the best option. Semantic parsers convert texts into representations of their meanings.  Psycholinguistics  In psycholinguistics, parsing involves not just the assignment of words to categories (formation of ontological insights), but the evaluation of the meaning of a sentence according to the rules of syntax drawn by inferences made from each word in the sentence (known as connotation). This normally occurs as words are being heard or read. Consequently, psycholinguistic models of parsing are of necessity incremental, meaning that they build up an interpretation as the sentence is being processed, which is normally expressed in terms of a partial syntactic structure. Creation of initially wrong structures occurs when interpreting garden-path sentences.  Discourse analysis  Discourse analysis examines ways to analyze language use and semiotic events. Persuasive language may be called rhetoric.  Computer languages   Parser  A parser is a software component that takes input data (frequently text) and builds a data structure – often some kind of parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other hierarchical structure, giving a structural representation of the input while checking for correct syntax. The parsing may be preceded or followed by other steps, or these may be combined into a single step. The parser is often preceded by a separate lexical analyser, which creates tokens from the sequence of input characters; alternatively, these can be combined in scannerless parsing. Parsers may be programmed by hand or may be automatically or semi-automatically generated by a parser generator. Parsing is complementary to templating, which produces formatted output. These may be applied to different domains, but often appear together, such as the scanf/printf pair, or the input (front end parsing) and output (back end code generation) stages of a compiler. The input to a parser is often text in some computer language, but may also be text in a natural language or less structured textual data, in which case generally only certain parts of the text are extracted, rather than a parse tree being constructed. Parsers range from very simple functions such as scanf, to complex programs such as the frontend of a C++ compiler or the HTML parser of a web browser. An important class of simple parsing is done using regular expressions, in which a group of regular expressions defines a regular language and a regular expression engine automatically generating a parser for that language, allowing pattern matching and extraction of text. In other contexts regular expressions are instead used prior to parsing, as the lexing step whose output is then used by the parser. The use of parsers varies by input. In the case of data languages, a parser is often found as the file reading facility of a program, such as reading in HTML or XML text; these examples are markup languages. In the case of programming languages, a parser is a component of a compiler or interpreter, which parses the source code of a computer programming language to create some form of internal representation; the parser is a key step in the compiler frontend. Programming languages tend to be specified in terms of a deterministic context-free grammar because fast and efficient parsers can be written for them. For compilers, the parsing itself can be done in one pass or multiple passes – see one-pass compiler and multi-pass compiler. The implied disadvantages of a one-pass compiler can largely be overcome by adding fix- ups, where provision is made for code relocation during the forward pass, and the fix-ups are applied backwards when the current program segment has been recognized as having been completed. An example where such a fix-up mechanism would be useful would be a forward GOTO statement, where the target of the GOTO is unknown until the program segment is completed. In this case, the application of the fix-up would be delayed until the target of the GOTO was recognized. Conversely, a backward GOTO does not require a fix-up, as the location will already be known. Context-free grammars are limited in the extent to which they can express all of the requirements of a language. Informally, the reason is that the memory of such a language is limited. The grammar cannot remember the presence of a construct over an arbitrarily long input; this is necessary for a language in which, for example, a name must be declared before it may be referenced. More powerful grammars that can express this constraint, however, cannot be parsed efficiently. Thus, it is a common strategy to create a relaxed parser for a context-free grammar which accepts a superset of the desired language constructs (that is, it accepts some invalid constructs); later, the unwanted constructs can be filtered out at the semantic analysis (contextual analysis) step. For example, in Python the following is syntactically valid code: x = 1 print(x) The following code, however, is syntactically valid in terms of the context-free grammar, yielding a syntax tree with the same structure as the previous, but is syntactically invalid in terms of the context-sensitive grammar, which requires that variables be initialized before use: x = 1 print(y) Rather than being analyzed at the parsing stage, this is caught by checking the values in the syntax tree, hence as part of semantic analysis: context-sensitive syntax is in practice often more easily analyzed as semantics.  Overview of process  Flow of data in a typical parser The following example demonstrates the common case of parsing a computer language with two levels of grammar: lexical and syntactic. The first stage is the token generation, or lexical analysis, by which the input character stream is split into meaningful symbols defined by a grammar of regular expressions. For example, a calculator program would look at an input such as \\"\`12 * (3 + 4)^2\`\\" and split it into the tokens \`12\`, \`*\`, \`(\`, \`3\`, \`+\`, \`4\`, \`)\`, \`^\`, \`2\`, each of which is a meaningful symbol in the context of an arithmetic expression. The lexer would contain rules to tell it that the characters \`*\`, \`+\`, \`^\`, \`(\` and \`)\` mark the start of a new token, so meaningless tokens like \\"\`12*\`\\" or \\"\`(3\`\\" will not be generated. The next stage is parsing or syntactic analysis, which is checking that the tokens form an allowable expression. This is usually done with reference to a context-free grammar which recursively defines components that can make up an expression and the order in which they must appear. However, not all rules defining programming languages can be expressed by context-free grammars alone, for example type validity and proper declaration of identifiers. These rules can be formally expressed with attribute grammars. The final phase is semantic parsing or analysis, which is working out the implications of the expression just validated and taking the appropriate action.Berant, Jonathan, and Percy Liang. \\"Semantic parsing via paraphrasing.\\" Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers). 2014. In the case of a calculator or interpreter, the action is to evaluate the expression or program; a compiler, on the other hand, would generate some kind of code. Attribute grammars can also be used to define these actions.  Types of parsers  The task of the parser is essentially to determine if and how the input can be derived from the start symbol of the grammar. This can be done in essentially two ways: *Top-down parsing - Top- down parsing can be viewed as an attempt to find left-most derivations of an input-stream by searching for parse trees using a top-down expansion of the given formal grammar rules. Tokens are consumed from left to right. Inclusive choice is used to accommodate ambiguity by expanding all alternative right- hand-sides of grammar rules.Aho, A.V., Sethi, R. and Ullman, J.D. (1986) \\" Compilers: principles, techniques, and tools.\\" Addison-Wesley Longman Publishing Co., Inc. Boston, MA, USA. This is known as the primordial soup approach. Very similar to sentence diagramming, primordial soup breaks down the constituencies of sentences. *Bottom-up parsing - A parser can start with the input and attempt to rewrite it to the start symbol. Intuitively, the parser attempts to locate the most basic elements, then the elements containing these, and so on. LR parsers are examples of bottom-up parsers. Another term used for this type of parser is Shift-Reduce parsing. LL parsers and recursive-descent parser are examples of top-down parsers which cannot accommodate left recursive production rules. Although it has been believed that simple implementations of top-down parsing cannot accommodate direct and indirect left-recursion and may require exponential time and space complexity while parsing ambiguous context-free grammars, more sophisticated algorithms for top-down parsing have been created by Frost, Hafiz, and CallaghanFrost, R., Hafiz, R. and Callaghan, P. (2007) \\" Modular and Efficient Top-Down Parsing for Ambiguous Left-Recursive Grammars .\\" 10th International Workshop on Parsing Technologies (IWPT), ACL-SIGPARSE , Pages: 109 - 120, June 2007, Prague.Frost, R., Hafiz, R. and Callaghan, P. (2008) \\" Parser Combinators for Ambiguous Left-Recursive Grammars.\\" 10th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (PADL), ACM-SIGPLAN , Volume 4902/2008, Pages: 167 - 181, January 2008, San Francisco. which accommodate ambiguity and left recursion in polynomial time and which generate polynomial-size representations of the potentially exponential number of parse trees. Their algorithm is able to produce both left-most and right-most derivations of an input with regard to a given context-free grammar. An important distinction with regard to parsers is whether a parser generates a leftmost derivation or a rightmost derivation (see context-free grammar). LL parsers will generate a leftmost derivation and LR parsers will generate a rightmost derivation (although usually in reverse). Some ' algorithms have been designed for visual programming languages.Rekers, Jan, and Andy Schürr. \\"Defining and parsing visual languages with layered graph grammars.\\" Journal of Visual Languages & Computing 8.1 (1997): 27-55.Rekers, Jan, and A. Schurr. \\"A graph grammar approach to graphical parsing.\\" Visual Languages, Proceedings., 11th IEEE International Symposium on. IEEE, 1995. Parsers for visual languages are sometimes based on graph grammars.Zhang, Da-Qian, Kang Zhang, and Jiannong Cao. \\"A context-sensitive graph grammar formalism for the specification of visual languages.\\" The Computer Journal 44.3 (2001): 186-200. Adaptive parsing algorithms have been used to construct \\"self-extending\\" natural language user interfaces.  Parser development software  Some of the well known parser development tools include the following: * ANTLR * Bison * Coco/R * Definite clause grammar * GOLD * JavaCC * Lemon * Lex * LuZc * Parboiled * Parsec * Ragel * Spirit Parser Framework * Syntax Definition Formalism * SYNTAX * XPL * Yacc * PackCC  Lookahead  C program that cannot be parsed with less than 2 token lookahead. Top: C grammar excerpt.taken from (Appendix A.13 \\"Grammar\\", p.193 ff) Bottom: a parser has digested the tokens \\"int v;main(){\\" and is about choose a rule to derive Stmt. Looking only at the first lookahead token \\"v\\", it cannot decide which of both alternatives for Stmt to choose; the latter requires peeking at the second token. Lookahead establishes the maximum incoming tokens that a parser can use to decide which rule it should use. Lookahead is especially relevant to LL, LR, and LALR parsers, where it is often explicitly indicated by affixing the lookahead to the algorithm name in parentheses, such as LALR(1). Most programming languages, the primary target of parsers, are carefully defined in such a way that a parser with limited lookahead, typically one, can parse them, because parsers with limited lookahead are often more efficient. One important change to this trend came in 1990 when Terence Parr created ANTLR for his Ph.D. thesis, a parser generator for efficient LL(k) parsers, where k is any fixed value. LR parsers typically have only a few actions after seeing each token. They are shift (add this token to the stack for later reduction), reduce (pop tokens from the stack and form a syntactic construct), end, error (no known rule applies) or conflict (does not know whether to shift or reduce). Lookahead has two advantages. * It helps the parser take the correct action in case of conflicts. For example, parsing the if statement in the case of an else clause. * It eliminates many duplicate states and eases the burden of an extra stack. A C language non- lookahead parser will have around 10,000 states. A lookahead parser will have around 300 states. Example: Parsing the Expression { class=\\"toccolours\\"  colspan=3  Set of expression parsing rules (called grammar) is as follows, -  Rule1:  E → E + E  style=\\"padding-left:1em\\"  Expression is the sum of two expressions. -  Rule2:  E → E * E  style=\\"padding-left:1em\\" Expression is the product of two expressions. -  Rule3:  E → number  style=\\"padding-left:1em\\" Expression is a simple number -  Rule4:  colspan=2  + has less precedence than * } Most programming languages (except for a few such as APL and Smalltalk) and algebraic formulas give higher precedence to multiplication than addition, in which case the correct interpretation of the example above is . Note that Rule4 above is a semantic rule. It is possible to rewrite the grammar to incorporate this into the syntax. However, not all such rules can be translated into syntax. ; Simple non-lookahead parser actions Initially Input = [1, +, 2, *, 3] # Shift \\"1\\" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule3). Input = [+, 2, *, 3] Stack = [1] # Reduces \\"1\\" to expression \\"E\\" based on rule3. Stack = [E] # Shift \\"+\\" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule1). Input = [2, *, 3] Stack = [E, +] # Shift \\"2\\" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule3). Input = [*, 3] Stack = [E, +, 2] # Reduce stack element \\"2\\" to Expression \\"E\\" based on rule3. Stack = [E, +, E] # Reduce stack items [E, +, E] and new input \\"E\\" to \\"E\\" based on rule1. Stack = [E] # Shift \\"*\\" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule2). Input = [3] Stack = [E,*] # Shift \\"3\\" onto stack from input (in anticipation of rule3). Input = [] (empty) Stack = [E, *, 3] # Reduce stack element \\"3\\" to expression \\"E\\" based on rule3. Stack = [E, *, E] # Reduce stack items [E, *, E] and new input \\"E\\" to \\"E\\" based on rule2. Stack = [E] The parse tree and resulting code from it is not correct according to language semantics. To correctly parse without lookahead, there are three solutions: * The user has to enclose expressions within parentheses. This often is not a viable solution. * The parser needs to have more logic to backtrack and retry whenever a rule is violated or not complete. The similar method is followed in LL parsers. * Alternatively, the parser or grammar needs to have extra logic to delay reduction and reduce only when it is absolutely sure which rule to reduce first. This method is used in LR parsers. This correctly parses the expression but with many more states and increased stack depth. ; Lookahead parser actions # Shift 1 onto stack on input 1 in anticipation of rule3. It does not reduce immediately. # Reduce stack item 1 to simple Expression on input + based on rule3. The lookahead is +, so we are on path to E +, so we can reduce the stack to E. # Shift + onto stack on input + in anticipation of rule1. # Shift 2 onto stack on input 2 in anticipation of rule3. # Reduce stack item 2 to Expression on input * based on rule3. The lookahead * expects only E before it. # Now stack has E + E and still the input is *. It has two choices now, either to shift based on rule2 or reduction based on rule1. Since * has higher precedence than + based on rule4, we shift * onto stack in anticipation of rule2. # Shift 3 onto stack on input 3 in anticipation of rule3. # Reduce stack item 3 to Expression after seeing end of input based on rule3. # Reduce stack items E * E to E based on rule2. # Reduce stack items E + E to E based on rule1. The parse tree generated is correct and simply than non-lookahead parsers. This is the strategy followed in LALR parsers.

Tee-ball (also teeball, tee ball or t-ball) is a team sport based on and simplifying baseball and softball. It is intended as an introduction for children aged 4 to 6 to develop ball-game skills and have fun. Description Tee-ball associations generally allow children between the ages of four and seven to play in their leagues. A tee-ball coach sets the team lineup and fielding positions in the team's scorebook. The positions that get the most action in tee-ball are pitcher and first base, followed by the rest of the infield positions. In some leagues, catcher is also a special position due to the added gear that is worn; in other leagues, there is no catcher. In tee-ball, the pitcher is usually used for defensive purposes only, though gently pitched balls may be used with older or more advanced players in place of the fixed tee. The ball is placed on an adjustable tee atop the home plate at a suitable height for the batter to strike. (In some clubs, adult coaches give the batter an opportunity to try and hit a few pitched balls before going to the tee in the hope that this will further develop batting skills.) Most of the other rules are similar or identical to those of baseball, though the game is played on a smaller field, typically one used for Little League or other youth baseball. In addition, for the youngest tee-ball players, runs and outs are often not recorded, and every player gets to bat each inning. A young catcher crouches behind the tee. Example tee-ball roster sign that is displayed so the fans can cheer the kids by name.Many parents assist during the game by coaching players in the dugout, in the field, on the bases, and at the plate. They often also perform the task of umpiring. Equipment specifications Bats: 25 to 26 inches long, 2.25 inches diameter, maximum weight 17 to 20 oz. Balls: typically appear identical to baseballs, but slightly softer to reduce injuries: 9 to 9.5 inches around, 4 to 5 oz weight, with a molded core or sponge rubber center.

History The game's origins date back to at least the 1950s, with several people claiming to be the father of the game, and it appears to have been independently invented in several places. Albion, Michigan claims to be the earliest place of invention of the sport, in 1956, by Jerome Sacharski.\\"T-Ball Invented in Albion\\", Frank Passic, Morning Star, April 28, 2002, pg. 5 Claude Lewis, director of the Warner Robins, Georgia, Recreation Department, formed a tee-ball league in March 1958, in which 20 children played the first year. Lewis designed rules for the new game and mailed the rule books out to rec departments all over the country and overseas. Nevertheless, Starkville, Mississippi claims to have independently created tee-ball in their town in 1961. According to the Starkville Rotary Club's website: \\"In 1961, when it was apparent that younger children needed some way to participate in the program, Rotarians Dr. Clyde Muse and W. W.

The Designers Republic (also tDR, and styled as The Designers Republic™) is a British graphic design studio based in Sheffield, England, founded in 1986 by Ian Anderson and Nick Phillips. They are best known for electronic music logos, album artwork, and anti-establishment aesthetics, embracing \\"brash consumerism and the uniform style of corporate brands\\". Work by tDR is held in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The studio in its larger form closed in January 2009, with Anderson stating it would continue in a more \\"slimline\\" form.  Style  Work by the Designers Republic generally is viewed as \\"playful and bright\\" and considered Maximum-minimalist, mixing images from Japanese anime and subvertised corporate logos, with a postmodern tendency towards irony. It often features statements/slogans such as \\"Work Buy Consume Die\\", \\"Robots Build Robots\\", \\"Customized Terror\\", \\"Buy nothing, pay now\\", and \\"Made in the Designers Republic\\". They also celebrated their northern roots with phrases like \\"Made in the Designers Republic, North of Nowhere\\" and \\"SoYo\\" (referring to Sheffield's county of South Yorkshire) — affirming they were not from London's design community in Soho.  History  Initially, Ian Anderson founded The Designers Republic to design flyers for the band Person to Person, which he managed at the time. His first ideas were inspired by Russian constructivism.Andrew Collins, Design o' the Times, NME, 11 February 1989, retrieved 29 May 2015 Nick Phillips, a sculptor and the organ player in World of Twist, soon joined him, and the duo created a visual identity for Fon Records, and album cover for Chakk’s 10 Days in an Elevator. This financed a studio space in the boardroom of a former engineering works. Another early client which brought them to the wider public's attention was Leeds band Age of Chance, for whom they developed a series of record covers between 1986 and 1987, beginning with a cover of the Prince track \\"Kiss\\". The duo worked 72-hour shifts, doing everything by hand using photocopiers, craft knives and spraymount. The record label loved the artwork but not the repro costs, which came to £9000 for Age of Chance's debut album, One Thousand Years of Trouble. The sleeve of the 1987 12-inch \\"Don't Get Mad... Get Even! (The New York Remixes)\\" was selected as one of Q’s \\"100 Best Record Covers of All Time\\" in 2001. Their work for Age of Chance led to further record sleeve work for Krush and Pop Will Eat Itself, for whom tDR bastardised the Pepsi logo to form the band's visual identity. In the 1990s, they established a faux corporation branded 'Pho-Ku', to express their dislike of corporate-driven consumerist identity. In 1994, Emigre magazine devoted a whole issue to the Designers Republic. A copy is held by MoMA. This issue is still Emigre’s best-ever seller and is now sold out, changing hands for up to £750. The Designers Republic later produced album cover designs for the electronica label Warp Records (also based in Sheffield). They designed the covers for most Warp artists, including Autechre and Aphex Twin. They also worked for other labels, designing sleeves for Moloko, Fluke, Funkstörung, The Orb, Pulp (and Jarvis Cocker), Supergrass and Towa Tei, and the New York City label Sleeping Giant Glossolalia. Outside the music industry, tDR created the visuals, packaging and manual for the PlayStation–Sega Saturn game Wipeout (1995), the interface for the PC game Hardwar (1998), and packaging and posters for the first Grand Theft Auto (1997). They collaborated with Swatch in 1996 to design their own watch. They also designed the packaging for Sony's AIBO. The book 3D → 2D: Adventures in And Out Of Architecture, released in 2001, was an architectural examination of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia presented in the graphic style of their previous work. tDR has consulted on the re-branding of the city of Quito, capital of Ecuador, and was the only non-national design company to be invited to propose a new flag for Slovenia.Brain Aided Design SoYo: The Designers Republic tDR was also commissioned to create a logo and general graphic design by French musician-producer Julien Civange for its Music2titan mission to take music on the European Space Agency's Cassini–Huygens probe to the moon Titan in 2004.http://www.music2titan.com/ On 20 January 2009, after 23 years in operation, tDR went into voluntary liquidation, Anderson bought back the company name and assets, and relaunched tDR as a smaller outfit.

The VT240 added monochrome ReGIS vector graphics support to the base model, while the VT241 did the same in color. The 200 series replaced the successful VT100 series, providing more functionality in a much smaller unit with a much smaller and lighter keyboard. Among its major upgrades was a number of international character sets, as well as the ability to define new character sets. The VT200 series was extremely successful in the market. Released at $795, the VT220 offered features, packaging and price that no other serial terminal could touch. In 1986, DEC shipped 165,000 units, giving them a 42% market share, double that of the closest competitor, Wyse. Competitors adapted by introducing similar models at lower prices, leading DEC to do the same by releasing the less-expensive $545 VT300 series in 1987. By that time, DEC had shipped over one million VT220s.David Bright, \\"DEC VT320 late, but low prices surprises\\", Computerworld, 31 August 1987, p. 16. Hardware The VT220 improved on the earlier VT100 series of terminals with a redesigned keyboard, much smaller physical packaging, and a much faster microprocessor. The VT220 was available with CRTs that used white, green, or amber phosphors. The VT100s, like the VT50s before them, had been packaged in relatively large cases that provided room for expansion systems. The VT200s abandoned this concept, and wrapped the much smaller 1980s-era electronics tightly around the CRT. The result was a truncated pyramidal case with the apex at the back, only slightly larger than the CRT. This made it much easier to fit the terminal on a desk. An adjustable stand allowed the angle of the CRT to be adjusted up and down. Because it was lower than head height, the result was an especially ergonomic terminal. The LK201 keyboard supplied with the VT220 was one of the first full-length, low-profile keyboards available; it was developed at DEC's Roxbury, Massachusetts facility. It was much smaller and lighter than the VT100s version, and connected to the terminal using a lighter and more flexible coiled cable and a telephone jack connector. The VT200s were the last DEC terminals to provide a 20mA current loop serial interface, an older standard originally developed for the telegraph system but became popular on computers due to the early use of Teletype Model 33's as ad hoc terminals. A standard 25-pin D-connector was also provided for RS-232. Only one of the two ports could be in use at a given time. Later DEC terminals would replace both of these with their proprietary Modified Modular Jack (MMJ) connectors. DEC VT220 connected to the serial port of a modern computer. Software The VT220 was designed to be compatible with the VT100, but added features to make it more suitable for an international market. This was accomplished by including a number of different character sets that could be selected among using a series of ANSI commands. Glyphs were formed within a 10 by 10 grid. The terminal shipped with a total of 288 characters in its ROM, each one formed from an 8 by 10 pixel glyph. Using only 8 of the columns left space between the characters. The characters included the 96 printable ASCII characters, 67 Display Controls, 32 DEC Special Graphics, and a backward question mark used to represent undefined characters. The VT200s included the ability to make minor changes to the character set using the National Replacement Character Set (NRCS) concept. When operating on an 8-bit clean link up to 256 character codes were available, which included a full set of European characters. But when operating on a typical 7-bit link, only 128 were available, and only 96 of these produced display output as the rest were control characters. This was not enough characters to handle all European languages. Most terminals solved this by shipping multiple complete character sets in ROM, but there was a cost in doing so. DEC's solution to this problem, NRCS, allowed individual characters glyphs in the base set of 96 7-bit characters to be swapped out. For instance, the British set made a single substitution, replacing the US's hash character, , with the pound sign, . The terminal included 14 such replacement sets, most of which swapped out about a dozen characters.\\"National Replacement Character Set (NRCS)\\"[sic] This eliminated the need to ship 14 versions of the terminal, or to include 14 different 7-bit character sets in ROM. Additionally, the VT200s allowed for another 96 characters in the Dynamically Redefined Character Set (DRCS), which could be downloaded from the host computer. Data for the glyphs was sent by encoding a set of six vertical pixels into a single character code, and then sending many of these Sixels to the terminal, which decoded them into the character set memory. In later models, the same sixel concept would be used to send bitmapped graphics as well. Character graphics were a common example of these downloaded sets.VT320 Soft Character Sets See also * Vttest - VT100 / VT220 / XTerm Test Utility * ANSI escape code References External links *Kermit 95 VT220 / VT320 Function Key Mapping *VT220 workstation operating modes *ECMA-48 Control Functions for Coded Character Sets Category:DEC hardware Category:Character-oriented terminal Category:Computer- related introductions in 1983 ","title":"VT220"},{"id":"310044","text":"Hua or HUA may refer to:  China  * Hua, as in Huaxia and Zhonghua, a name of China ** Hoa people, Chinese people in Vietnam * Hua (state), a state in ancient China, destroyed by Qin * Hua (surname), a Chinese surname * Hua County, in Anyang, Henan, China * Hua County, Guangdong, now Huadu District, in Guangzhou, Guangdong, China * Hua County, Shaanxi, now Huazhou District, in Weinan, Shaanxi, China * Mount Hua, a mountain in Shaanxi, China  Other uses  * Hua Islet, Wangan Township, Penghu County (the Pescadores), Taiwan (Republic of China) * Hua language (disambiguation), a name used for several unrelated languages * Hua's lemma, in analytic number theory * Harkat-ul-Ansar (HuA), an Islamic paramilitary organization * Heard Understood Acknowledged, possible origin of hooah, a U.S. Army battle cry * Redstone Army Airfield in Alabama, U.S. * Turbonilla hua, a species of sea snail in the family Pyramidellidae See also * An hua, in Chinese ceramics, a term meaning \\"secret decoration\\" ","title":"Hua"},{"id":"310046","text":"James Gaius Watt (born January 31, 1938) is a public servant who served as U.S. Secretary of the Interior from 1981 to 1983. Often described as \\"anti- environmentalist\\", he was one of Ronald Reagan's most controversial cabinet appointments. Watt's pro-development views played an instrumental role in ending the Sagebrush Rebellion. Early life and career Watt was born in Lusk, Wyoming, the son of Lois Mae (née Williams) and William Gaius Watt. He attended the University of Wyoming, earning a bachelor's degree in 1960 and a juris doctor degree in 1962. Watt's first political job was as an aide to Republican Party Senator Milward L. Simpson of Wyoming, whom he met through Simpson's son, Alan. A lifelong Republican, he served as Secretary to the Natural Resources Committee and Environmental Pollution Advisory Panel of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a pro-business organization that supports primarily Republican candidates. In 1969, Watt was appointed the deputy assistant secretary of water and power development at the Department of the Interior. In 1975, Watt was appointed vice chairman of the Federal Power Commission. In 1977, Watt became the first president and chief legal officer of Mountain States Legal Foundation, a public interest law firm \\"dedicated to individual liberty, the right to own and use property, limited and ethical government and economic freedom.\\"Mountain States Legal Foundation A number of attorneys who worked for Watt at the firm later became high-ranking officers of the federal government, including Ann Veneman and Gale Norton. Secretary of the Interior In 1980, President-elect Reagan nominated Watt as his Secretary of the Interior. The United States Senate subsequently confirmed the nomination. His tenure as Secretary of the Interior was controversial, primarily because he was perceived as being hostile to environmentalism, and endorsed development of federal lands by foresting and ranching, and for other commercial interests. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, Watt had the record, among those who served as Secretary of the Interior, of listing the fewest species protected under the Endangered Species Act. The record was later surpassed by Dirk Kempthorne, a George W. Bush appointee who, as of August 27, 2007 , had not listed a single species in the 15-month period since his confirmation.Kempthorne Wins 2007 Rubber Dodo Award : Protects Fewer Species Than Any Interior Secretary in History Greg Wetstone, the chief environment counsel at the House Energy and Commerce Committee during the Reagan administration, who subsequently served as director of advocacy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, argued that Watt was one of the two most \\"intensely controversial and blatantly anti-environmental political appointees\\" in American history. The other was Anne Gorsuch, director of the EPA at the time.A look back at Reagan's environmental record  By Amanda Griscom  Grist  Muckraker  10 Jun 2004 Environmental groups accused Watt of reducing funding for environmental programs,James G. Watt Summary Review and Analysis restructuring the department to decrease federal regulatory power, wanting to eliminate the Land and Water Conservation Fund which aimed at increasing the area of wildlife refuges and other protected land, easing regulations of oil and mining, directing the National Park Service to draft rules that would de-authorize congressionally authorized national parks, and recommending lease of wilderness and shore lands such as Santa Monica Bay to explore and develop oil and gas. Watt resisted accepting donation of private land to be used for conservation.The Legacy of James Watt Time Oct. 24, 1983 He suggested that 80 million acres (320,000 km²) of undeveloped land in the United States all be opened for drilling and mining by 2000. The area leased to coal mining quintupled during his term as Secretary of the Interior. Watt boasted that he leased \\"a billion acres\\" (4 million km²) of coastal waters, even though only a small portion of that area would ever be drilled. Watt once stated, \\"We will mine more, drill more, cut more timber.\\"Mountain States Legal Foundation Watt periodically mentioned his Dispensationalist Christian faith when discussing his method of environmental management. Speaking before Congress, he once said, \\"I do not know how many future generations we can count on before the Lord returns, whatever it is we have to manage with a skill to leave the resources needed for future generations.\\" One apocryphal quotation falsely attributed to Watt is: \\"After the last tree is felled, Christ will come back.\\" Glenn Scherer, writing for Grist magazine, erroneously attributed this remark to 1981 testimony by Watt before Congress. Journalist Bill Moyers, relying on the Grist article, also attributed the comment to Watt. After it was discovered that the alleged quotation did not exist, Grist corrected the error, and Moyers apologized. \\"I never said it. Never believed it. Never even thought it,\\" Watt later wrote of the statement. \\"I know no Christian who believes or preaches such error.

And we have talent.\\" Within three weeks of making this statement, on October 9, 1983, he announced his resignation at deputy undersecretary Thomas J. Barrack's ranch, near President Reagan's Rancho del Cielo. Later life Misdemeanor conviction After leaving the Department of the Interior in 1983, Watt lobbied the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ten years later, Watt was indicted on 18 counts of felony perjury and obstruction of justice and accused of making false statements before a federal grand jury investigating influence peddling at the Department of Housing and Urban Development at that time.Crimes Against Nature : Rolling Stone (p. 3) On January 2, 1996, Watt pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of withholding documents. On March 12, 1996, he was sentenced to five years' probation, and ordered to pay a fine of $5,000 and perform 500 hours of community service. Views on Bush 43 Presidency In a 2001 interview with The Denver Post, Watt applauded the energy policy of the second Bush administration, stating that it was just what he recommended in the early 1980s: \\"You've got to have more oil, you've got to have more coal, you've got to have more of everything,\\" Watt said. \\"You've got to have more conservation too, but … solar energy and wind energy — they're just teeny infant portions [of energy].

Nowadays, it is considered a movement based on the cultural revindication of a Catalan identity. Its main form of expression was in architecture, but many other arts were involved (painting, sculpture, etc.), and especially the design and the decorative arts (cabinetmaking, carpentry, forged iron, ceramic tiles, ceramics, glass-making, silver and goldsmith work, etc.), which were particularly important, especially in their role as support to architecture. Modernisme was also a literary movement (poetry, fiction, drama). Although Modernisme was part of a general trend that emerged in Europe around the turn of the 20th century, in Catalonia the trend acquired its own unique personality. Modernisme's distinct name comes from its special relationship, primarily with Catalonia and Barcelona, which were intensifying their local characteristics for socio- ideological reasons after the revival of Catalan culture and in the context of spectacular urban and industrial development. It is equivalent to a number of other fin de siècle art movements going by the names of Art Nouveau in France and Belgium, Jugendstil in Germany, Vienna Secession in Austria-Hungary, Liberty style in Italy and Modern or Glasgow Style in Scotland. Modernisme was active from roughly 1888 (the First Barcelona World Fair) to 1911 (the death of Joan Maragall, the most important Modernista poet). The Modernisme movement was centred in the city of Barcelona, though it reached far beyond, and is best known for its architectural expression, especially in the work of Antoni Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch, but was also significant in sculpture, poetry, theatre and painting. Notable painters include Santiago Rusiñol, Ramon Casas,Hughes, Robert (1993) 'Barcelona', London, , p. 253. Isidre Nonell, Hermen Anglada Camarasa, Joaquim Mir, Eliseu Meifrèn, Lluïsa Vidal and Miquel Utrillo. Notable sculptors are Josep Llimona, Eusebi Arnau and Miquel Blai. Main concepts Duana de Barcelona (Customs House), by Enric Sagnier Catalan nationalism was an important influence upon Modernista artists, who were receptive to the ideas of Valentí Almirall and Enric Prat de la Riba and wanted Catalan culture to be regarded as equal to that of other European countries. Such ideas can be seen in some of Rusiñol's plays against the Spanish army (most notably L'Hèroe), in some authors close to anarchism (Jaume Brossa and Gabriel Alomar, for example) or in the articles of federalist anti-monarchic writers such as Miquel dels Sants Oliver. They also opposed the traditionalism and religiousness of the Renaixença Catalan Romantics, whom they ridiculed in plays such as Santiago Rusiñol's Els Jocs Florals de Canprosa (roughly, \\"The Poetry Contest of Proseland\\"), a satire of the revived Jocs Florals and the political milieu which promoted them. Modernistes largely rejected bourgeois values, which they thought to be the opposite of art. Consequently, they adopted two stances: they either set themselves apart from society in a bohemian or culturalist attitude (Decadent and Parnassian poets, Symbolist playwrights, etc.) or they attempted to use art to change society (Modernista architects and designers, playwrights inspired by Henrik Ibsen, some of Maragall's poetry, etc.) Architecture The Castle of the Three Dragons in Barcelona The earliest example of Modernista architecture is the Castle of the Three Dragons designed by Lluís Domènech i Montaner in the Parc de la Ciutadella for the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition. It is a search for a particular style for Catalonia drawing on Medieval and Arab styles. Like the currents known in other countries as Art Nouveau, Jugendstil, Liberty style, Modern Style and Vienna Secession, Modernisme was closely related to the English Arts and Crafts movement and the Gothic Revival. As well as combining a rich variety of historically-derived elements, it is characterized by the predominance of the curve over the straight line, by rich decoration and detail, by the frequent use of vegetal and other organic motifs, the taste for asymmetry, a refined aestheticism and dynamic shapes.Solà-Morales, I, (1992) 'Arquitectura Modernista, fi de segle a Barcelona', Barcelona, . While Barcelona was the centre of Modernista construction, the Catalan industrial bourgeoisie built industrial buildings and summer residences (cases d'estiueig) in many Catalan towns, notably Terrassa and Reus. The textile factory which is now home to the Catalan national technical museum mNACTEC is an outstanding example. Antoni Gaudí is the best-known architect of this movement. Other influential architects were Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch, and later Josep Maria Jujol, Rafael Guastavino and Enrique Nieto.Mackay, David, 'Modern architecture in Barcelona, 1854-1929', Barcelona, 1985.  Architects  Casa Batlló by Antoni Gaudí in Barcelona There were more than 100 architects who made buildings of the Modernista style, three of whom are particularly well known for their outstanding buildings: Antoni Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch. * Antoni Gaudí, who went beyond mainstream Modernisme, creating a personal style based on observation of the nature and exploitation of traditional Catalan construction traditions. He was using regulated geometric shapes as the hyperbolic paraboloid, the hyperboloid, the helicoid and the conoide.http://noticias.arq.com.mx/Detalles/9955.html. * Lluís Domènech i Montaner created a genuine alternative architecture. Along with Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas he worked towards a modern and international style. Domènech continued on from Viollet-le-Duc, his work characterized by a mix of constructive rationalism and ornaments inspired in the Hispano-Arab architecture as seen in the Palau de la Música Catalana, in the Hospital de Sant Pau or in the Institut Pere Mata of Reus. His Hotel Internacional at Passeig de Colom in Barcelona (demolished after the 1888 World Fair) was an early example of industrial building techniques. * Josep Puig i Cadafalch was a Catalan architect, politician and historian who was involved in many projects to restore older buildings. One of his most well-known buildings is his rebuilding of the Casa Amatller in Passeig de Gràcia. It has elements in both the Catalan tradition and others originating in the Netherlands or the German Gothic. Neo-Gothic is also apparent in his Codorniu Winery (Caves Codorniu, 1904). He built Casa Amatller and Casa Trinxet.

The nouvelles and novels of decadent writers such as Prudenci Bertrana (whose highly controversial Josafat involved a demented priest who ends up killing a prostitute), Caterina Albert (also known as Víctor Catala), author of bloody, expressionistic tales of rural violence, opposed to the idealisation of nature propugned by Catalan Romantics, or Raimon Casellas have been highly influential upon later Catalan narrative, essentially recovering a genre that had been lost due to political causes since the end of the Middle Ages. Those writers often, though not always, show influences from Russian literature of the 19th century and also Gothic novels. Still, works not influenced by those sources, such as Joaquim Ruyra's slice- of-life tales of the North-Eastern Catalan coast are perhaps even more influential than that of the aforementioned authors, and Rusiñol's well-known L'auca del senyor Esteve (roughly \\"The Tale of Mr. Esteve\\"; an auca is a type of illustrated broadside, similar to a one-sheet comic book) is an ironic critique of Catalan bourgeoisie more related to ironic, pre-Realist Catalan costumisme. In poetry, Modernisme closely follows Symbolist and Parnassian poetry, with poets frequently crossing the line between both tendencies or alternating between them. Another important strain of Modernista poetry is Joan Maragall's \\"Paraula viva\\" (Living word) school, which advocated Nietzschean vitalism and spontaneous and imperfect writing over cold and thought-over poetry. Although poetry was very popular with the Modernistes and there were many poets involved in the movement, Maragall is the only Modernista poet who is still widely read today. Modernista theatre was also important, as it smashed the insubstantial regional plays that were popular in 19th-century Catalonia. There were two main schools of Modernista theatre: social theatre, which intended to change society and denounce injustice—the worker stories of Ignasi Iglésias, for example Els Vells (\\"The old ones\\"); the Ibsen-inspired works of Joan Puig i Ferreter, most notably Aigües Encantades (\\"Enchanted Waters\\"); Rusiñol's antimilitaristic play L'Hèroe—and symbolist theatre, which emphasised the distance between artists and the bourgeoisie—for example, Rusiñol's Cigales i Formigues (\\"Cicadas and Ants\\") or El Jardí Abandonat (\\"The Abandoned Garden\\"). Linguistics Modernista ideas impelled L'Avenç collaborator Pompeu Fabra to devise a new orthography for Catalan. However, only with the later rise of Noucentisme did his projects come to fruition and end the orthographic chaos which reigned at the time. Decline By 1910, Modernisme had been accepted by the bourgeoisie and had pretty much turned into a fad. It was around this time that Noucentista artists started to ridicule the rebel ideas of Modernisme and propelled a more bourgeois art and a more right-of-centre version of Catalan Nationalism, which eventually rose to power with the victory of the Lliga Regionalista in 1912. Until Miguel Primo de Rivera's dictatorship suppressed all substantial public use of Catalan, Noucentisme was immensely popular in Catalonia. However, Modernisme did have a revival of sorts during the Second Spanish Republic, with avant- garde writers such as Futurist Joan-Salvat Papasseit earning comparisons to Joan Maragall, and the spirit of Surrealists such as Josep Vicent Foix or Salvador Dalí being clearly similar to the rebellion of the Modernistes, what with Dalí proclaiming that Catalan Romanticist Àngel Guimerà was a putrefact pervert. However, the ties between Catalan art from the 1930s and Modernisme are not that clear, as said artists were not consciously attempting to continue any tradition. Modernista architecture survived longer. The Spanish city of Melilla in Northern Africa experienced an economic boom at the turn of the 20th century, and its new bourgeoisie showed its riches by massively ordering Modernista buildings. The workshops established there by Catalan architect Enrique Nieto continued producing decorations in this style even when it was out of fashion in Barcelona, which results in Melilla having, oddly enough, the second-largest concentration of Modernista works after Barcelona.

It had a relatively brief commercial career before it was replaced by types which could carry more passengers. The He 70 was a leading design for its day, setting eight world speed records by the beginning of 1933. Design and development The Heinkel He 70 Blitz (Lightning) was designed in the early 1930s to serve as a mailplane for Deutsche Lufthansa in response to a request for an aircraft faster than the Lockheed Model 9 Orion (used by Swissair) to service short routes. It was a low-wing monoplane, with the main characteristics of its design being an aerodynamically efficient elliptical wing, a two-bladed propeller driven by a single engine. In order to meet the demanding speed requirements, the design endeavored to minimise drag, with flush rivets giving a smooth surface finish, and retractable main landing gear. The tail wheel was not retractable. It was powered by a BMW VI V12 engine of 630hp cooled by ethylene glycol rather than water. This allowed a smaller radiator which also retracted at high speed to further reduce drag. The pilot and radio operator were seated in tandem, followed by a cabin seating four passengers in pairs facing each other.Smith and Kay 1972, p.234. and proved to have excellent performance, setting eight world records for speed over distance, and reaching a maximum speed of 377 km/h (222 mph).Donald 1999, p.494. Operational history Luft Hansa operated He 70s between 1934 and 1937 for a fast flight service which connected Berlin with Frankfurt, Hamburg and Cologne, as well as on the Cologne/Hamburg route. He 70s were flown abroad from Stuttgart to Seville between 1934 and 1936. The route was part of the South America mail service provided by Luft Hansa that continued via Bathurst, The Gambia to Natal, Brazil, using Junkers Ju 52/3m and Dornier Wal flying boats. Remaining aircraft were transferred to the Luftwaffe in 1937. Military use Royal Hungarian Air Force He 70Ks The Luftwaffe operated He 70s from 1935, initially as a light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. As soon as purpose built designs became available, it was relegated as a liaison and courier aircraft. Twenty-eight aircraft were sent in the late 1930s to Spain with the German-manned Legion Condor, where they were used during the Spanish Civil War as fast reconnaissance aircraft. There they were known as the Rayo, Spanish for \\"lightning\\". The He 70K (later He 170) was a fast reconnaissance airplane variant used by the German air force. Fitted with a new WM-K-14 radial engine, it was used by the Royal Hungarian Air Force as the He 170A early in World War II during 1941–42. The main weakness of the He 70 in military use was that crews considered it a fire risk. Elements of the airframe were made out of an extremely flammable magnesium alloy called \\"Elektron\\", though the majority of the monocoque fuselage was Duralumin. Elektron is very light yet strong, but burns readily when ignited and is difficult to extinguish. Moreover, each wing contained a non-self-sealing 47-gallon fuel tank, which may have further added to the aircraft's reputation for catching fire. A single hit from a light machine gun is reputed to have often set the entire aircraft ablaze. The Hungarian He 170A fleet was retired for this and other reasons, including poor defensive armament, short range and poor view from the cabin, and replaced with vintage, high-wing He 46 monoplanes, until modern Bf 109 fighter- reconnaissance and specialized Fw 189 \\"Uhu\\" medium altitude observation aircraft could be introduced. Influence While the He 70 saw only limited service in training capacities during World War II, it was the Luftwaffes first Schnellbomber and served as the antecedent for the majority of bombers involved in both the Battle of Britain and the attack on Pearl Harbor. German designs The He 70 is known mainly as the direct ancestor of the Heinkel He 111, which had the distinctive elliptical wings and streamlined fuselage in a twin-engine configuration. One can also see the close similarity of the designs in the tail section and cockpit of the early He 111. The He 111, which began service with the Luftwaffe in 1936, went on to become the most numerous bomber type of the Luftwaffe – with just over 5,600 examples produced during the war in total – in the early years of World War II, before the growing numbers of Junkers Ju 88 bomber variants (the -A and -S subtypes) overtook it later in World War II. Heinkel's pioneering design was also a model for the He 112 fighter which competed unsuccessfully against the Messerschmitt Bf 109 to become the Luftwaffes first monoplane fighter. The He 112 was nonetheless built in small numbers, and its performance proved once again the strength of the He 70's original design. Japanese designs The He 70 was exported to Japan for study and inspired the Aichi D3A (\\"Val\\") carrier-launched light bomber.Mark Peattie, Sunburst: The Rise of Japanese Naval Air Power, 1909–1941, p. 94 This aircraft shared the He 70's distinctive low-mounted elliptical wing and was one of several collaborations between Heinkel and the Japanese aviation industry. British designs It has been said that the He 70 was an inspiration or influence for the Supermarine Spitfire's elliptical wing. In a letter to Heinkel, written after seeing the aircraft perform with the Rolls Royce Kestrel engine fitted, R. J. Mitchell said: However, Beverley Shenstone, RJ Mitchell's aerodynamic advisor denied that the Spitfire wing was copied from the He 70. Shenstone said: The Günther brothers had already used an elliptical wing design for the Bäumer Sausewind sports aircraft before they joined Heinkel. Shenstone said that the He 70's influence on the Spitfire design was limited to use as a benchmark for aerodynamic smoothness.

Their territory was on the north side of the Thames estuary in current Essex, Hertfordshire and Suffolk, and included lands now located in Greater London. They were bordered to the north by the Iceni, and to the west by the Catuvellauni. Their name possibly derives from the Celtic intensive prefix \\"tri-\\" and a second element which was either \\"novio\\" – new, so meaning \\"very new\\" in the sense of \\"newcomers\\", but possibly with an applied sense of vigorous or lively ultimately meaning \\"the very vigorous people\\". Their capital was Camulodunum (modern Colchester), one proposed site of the legendary Camelot. Shortly before Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain in 55 and 54 BC, the Trinovantes were considered the most powerful tribe in Britain. At this time their capital was probably at Braughing (in modern-day Hertfordshire). In some manuscripts of Caesar's Gallic War their king is referred to as Imanuentius, although in other manuscripts no name is given. Some time before Caesar's second expedition this king was overthrown by Cassivellaunus, who is usually assumed to have belonged to the Catuvellauni. His son, Mandubracius, fled to the protection of Caesar in Gaul. During his second expedition Caesar defeated Cassivellaunus and restored Mandubracius to the kingship, and Cassivellaunus undertook not to molest him again. Tribute was also agreed. Coin of the Trinovantes. The next identifiable king of the Trinovantes, known from numismatic evidence, was Addedomarus, who took power c. 20–15 BC, and moved the tribe's capital to Camulodunum. For a brief period c. 10 BC Tasciovanus of the Catuvellauni issued coins from Camulodunum, suggesting that he conquered the Trinovantes, but he was soon forced to withdraw, perhaps as a result of pressure from the Romans, as his later coins no longer bear the mark \\"Rex\\", and Addedomarus was restored. Addedomarus was briefly succeeded by his son Dubnovellaunus c. 10-5 BC, but a few years later the tribe was finally conquered by either Tasciovanus or his son Cunobelinus. Addedomarus, Dubnovellaunus and possibly Mandubracius all appear in later, post-Roman and medieval British Celtic genealogies and legends as Aedd Mawr (Addedo the Great) Dyfnwal Moelmut (Dubnovellaunus the Bald and Silent) and Manawydan. The Welsh Triads recall Aedd Mawr as one of the founders of Britain. Coin of the Trinovantes. The Trinovantes reappeared in history when they participated in Boudica's revolt against the Roman Empire in 60 AD. Their name was given to one of the civitates of Roman Britain, whose chief town was Caesaromagus (modern Chelmsford, Essex). The style of their rich burials (see facies of Aylesford) is of continental origin and evidence of their affiliation to the Belgic people. Their name was re-used as Trinovantum, the supposed original name of London, by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his Historia Regum Britanniae, in which he claimed the name derived from Troi-novantum or \\"New Troy\\", connecting this with the legend that Britain was founded by Brutus and other refugees from the Trojan War. Popular culture In Chelmsford 123, a British television situation comedy produced for Channel 4 by Hat Trick Productions, the main character of Badvoc (played by Rory McGrath) was the leader of The Trinovantes.

It lies to the south of ferry port Brodick, in a sheltered bay on the island's east coast, facing the Holy Island. Lamlash is the seat of Arran's local government offices, and is also the location of the island's only police station (rarely manned), secondary school and hospital. In common with the rest of the island, the town's main industry is tourism and the public sector is also an important employer. Lamlash has an RNLI Lifeboat station with a B class Atlantic 75 lifeboat, covering the inshore waters around the coast of Arran, and in summer, there is a regular ferry service from Lamlash harbour to Holy Island. The town has several buildings of historical interest, including Hamilton Terrace, which consists of two rows of idyllic single storey-and- attic cottages on the Lamlash seafront, arranged in pairs.  History  A prehistoric ring of stones indicates that an ancient settlement has existed near Lamlash since antiquity. The name Lamlash dates back to the 6th Century hermitage of Saint Molaise a Celtic monk born in Ireland but raised in Scotland, who in c.590 spent some time in a cave on the neighbouring Holy Island. Commonly known as MoLaise the Gaelic name of Holy Island was, as a result, Eilean MoLaise. This gradually evolved through Elmolaise and Lemolash to Lamlash, which is what Holy Island was called until early in the 19th century. After that time the name was more normally attached to the village that grew up facing it. Lamlash was peripherally involved in the 13th century Battle of Largs. It was the birthplace of artist James Kay. When Mary, Queen of Scots was at Dumbarton Castle in February 1548 during the war of the Rough Wooing, the English commander Grey of Wilton proposed basing some warships at \\"Lammelashe\\" to watch for French ships.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 586. The town was the training place for No. 11 (Scottish) Commando during the early years of the Second World War.  Geography  Lamlash is located in the southern half of the island, some to the south of Brodick and to the north of Whiting Bay. It is on the eastern side and sits on a bay facing the Holy Isle and the Firth of Clyde.  Layout and notable sights  \\"An elongated settlement character\\" The basic character of the town is formed by a long building line of two and three-storey roughcast or stone houses lining the inland side of the shore road. The parish church and the former St George's church sit at either end of this series of buildings. Only the scattered buildings around the pierhead break this pattern. This elongated settlement character was already well established in the 19th century. The creation of Hamilton Terrace and its shorefront public space added to the image of Lamlash as it looks today. Lamlash has several characteristic buildings, some of them listed for their special architectural or historical interest. These include: Hamilton Terrace Hamilton Terrace consists of two rows of single storey-and-attic cottages of which numbers 1-27 are on the Lamlash seafront, arranged in pairs. Numbers 1a-24a are positioned behind these and are probably coeval with numbers 1-27 and assumed to have been built for residents' summer occupation allowing the main houses to be let to visitors, an accepted practice in Arran. The terrace is a major architectural feature of the village, designed by Sir John James Burnet and constructed in the late 19th century. The houses have survived with a minimum of changes, even to their rear elevation. Some still have original glazing. One of the houses functions as the Lamlash Post Office at no 27. On the front side (seaside) the complex had two rectangular garden enclosures; one of these is currently a car park. On the lawn between the enclosures is a modern monument in remembrance of the Arran clearance emigrants in the form of 3 standing stones. Churches St George's church St George's United free Church stands on the northern end of Lamlash, on Bungalow Road in the Margnaheglish neighbourhood. The church was erected between 1885-1892 in early English style by the Duke of Hamilton to replace a church of 1774. It is built in cream-coloured sandstone and has a striking square stone pyramidal spire with an iron weathervane. The church was used by the Lamlash Free Church congregation from 1892 until the union of the Free and United Presbyterian Churches in 1900, when it became the United Free Church. From 1929 it formed one of the congregations of Lamlash Parish church at that year's union with the Church of Scotland. The church was in use until 1947 and stands empty since. As of 2015, the building was undergoing renovation. The Arran Theatre and Arts Trust, established in 1989 had as its main objective to convert St George's Church into a theatre. As part of that objective, the Trust ran many events and brought touring companies to Arran, but because of \\"wider political issues\\" the plan never materialized. Similarly, plans to turn it into a Childhood Heritage Museum also failed in 1999. In the meantime the Scottish Civic Trust added the church to the register of \\"Buildings at Risk\\" in 1993. A chance to save the building arose in October 2004 when CRGP Architects & Surveyors from Glasgow applied for permission for the conversion of the church to form 8 flats and the erection of an extension to the rear to form 6 flats with associated parking. The application was granted on 7 Feb. 2005 by the North Ayrshire Council, subject to a number of conditions. However, the development was not realized. Then, in February 2007 the North Ayrshire Council commissioned ARP Lorimer and Associates (ARPL) to carry out a townscape audit for the Lamlash seafront with the specific assignment (i.a.) to evaluate the potential for the Church. In its report ARPL considered the state of the church poor but saveable. It recommended that -as a category B listed building- the retention of this historic structure is of importance. ARPL suggested to convert the church into three apartments and to build some new development to the rear to make it financially viable (just as CRGP Architects had requested 3 years earlier), and advised the Council to encourage the owner to progress the development to ensure the building did not decline to the point where demolition is required. Again, nothing happened and as of summer 2010 the building still stands neglected. Minutes of the Arran Community Council show that the future of the church is a regular topic of debate, but difficulty in contacting the private owner or convincing him to cooperate seem to be (part of) the reason that there has been no progress to date. The church's former manse (next door) is also a category B listed building. It was built in 1898 and remained in use as manse for the united congregation until circa 1990. Lamlash and Kilbride Parish Church and the church hall. It is a T-plan, aisleless, Gothic-style church built in 1886 by Hugh Barclay (architect) in red sandstone with a massive campanile-like tower. The church is prominently situated on the Shore Road and is listed in category A in consideration of the prominent tower. It replaces an earlier plain building of 1773, itself replacing the earlier Kilbride church, the remains of which survive at the present Lamlash graveyard. The cross and baptismal font in the church were both unearthed in the graveyard of the old Kilbride Church in 1892, and are thought to be of 14th-century origin. In the tower is a 9-bell carillon. The church hall -a separate, adjacent building- was built and used for worship some years before the church itself (around 1880), and included a reading room and library. It is a single storey, rectangular-plan hall, made into a T-plan by lower wings. The Lookout Abandoned villa \\"The Lookout\\" The Lookout is an early to mid-19th-century classical villa with prominent corner pilasters and Tudor Jacobean details, located on the main road close to the shore. It has some later additions and unfortunate alterations to the facade. The current condition is poor and deteriorating. Roof flashings are missing and the rainwater goods are leaking. Windows are smashed and boarded up, making the building an eyesore rather than a monument to be admired. The interior too is likely to need significant renewal. The Lookout remains a building of local value and character though. Probably originally a villa, it possibly became a bank in the 1850s or 60s. The building was marked as 'Bank' on Ordnance Survey maps of 1868, 1897 and 1924. In October 2002, the North Ayrshire Council turned down an application by John Thomson Construction Limited (from Lamlash) to have the building demolished. It was argued that demolition would be contrary to national policy and to the Isle of Arran Local Plan as it would have an adverse impact on the Lamlash Conservation Area. The Council also considered that it had not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the Lookout could not be restored and brought back into use as advised by Historic Scotland. In 2004 the Scottish Civic Trust added the villa to the register of \\"Buildings at Risk\\". Then, in February 2007 the North Ayrshire Council commissioned ARP Lorimer and Associates (ARPL) to carry out a townscape audit for the Lamlash seafront with the specific assignment (i.a.) to evaluate the potential for the \\"Lookout\\". In its report ARPL suggested a residential conversion into four flats as the most economically viable option to save the building. But there was no follow-up and in September 2009 an inspection revealed that the condition of the building had further deteriorated. Several of the windows have missing or broken glazing and the building was neither wind nor watertight. This was still the case as of summer 2010. The Lookout was demolished in March 2012. Other listed buildings Glenkiln, a mid-19th-century farmhouse and includes two adjoining cottages from the early 19th century. It is one of the two remaining farms in Lamlash (of the 7 there once were), the other one being the Clauchlands Farm. Monamore Bridge Millhouse, an early 19th-century single storey former mill house in L-form. Whitehouse Lodge, a late 19th-century lodge, formerly belonging to the (demolished) White House mansion. The lodge is single storey-and-attic with a basically rectangular-plan. The site of the former White House itself is now designated for development. Bellhaven, a single storey and attic 3-bay cottage from 1808 next to the Parish Church. Other notable buildings are the former pier house with clock tower (1885); the 'Crafts Made in Arran' Shop (late 19th century); the early 19th century Pier of red rubble blocks; the Sea Gate, part of the former Steamer Pier Office (1902) and the Bay Hotel, the latter being a good example of an early Victorian villa. \\"Hamilton Terrace\\" and the Clearances Monument The Clearances (Scottish Gaelic: Fuadach nan Gàidheal, the expulsion of the Gael) is a period in the 18th and 19th centuries where large forced displacements of the rural population in Scotland took place as part of a process of agricultural change. The clearances led to mass emigration to the sea coast, the Scottish Lowlands and the North American colonies. In general the Clearances on Arran seem to have been less brutal than in many other places in Scotland, but when the crofters in Glen Sannox had to make way for large-scale sheep farming, many of them saw no other option than to emigrate, and they departed from Lamlash. For this reason, Arran's Clearance Monument is situated in Lamlash, in front of Hamilton Terrace. A plaque on the monument recalls their departure and their new life as settlers in Canada with the following words: Erected on behalf of Arran clearance descendants across North America to their brave forefathers who departed from their beloved island home to Canada during the clearance years 1829 to 1840. Here at Lamlash on April 25, 1829 part of the clearance (86 souls) when embarking on the brig Caledonia (196 ton) the Rev.A.Mackay preached from The Mound (opposite) formed by the departing his text \\"Casting all your care upon him: for he careth for you\\" 1st Peter ch.5 v.7. The Caledonia arrived at Quebec City June 25th 1829. The group was the first of more than 300 Arran colonists of Megantic County, Province of Quebec. The largest group, more than 400, had as their destination the seaport town of Dalhousie, New Brunswick to be pioneer settlers of the Restigouche-Bay Chaleur District. \\"Yet still the blood is strong, the heart is highland\\". A chlann eilean mo ghaoil bithibh dileas d'a cheile. The monument was erected at the initiative of the Canadian descendants of the Arran emigrants. Former community centre Lamlash Community Centre on Benlister Road was a large former military hall from 1914. The hall (rectangular, single storey, corrugated-iron) was built by the Admiralty in 1914 as accommodation for the fleet arriving at Lamlash. It was supplied in prefabricated form, assembled on site quickly and cheaply. It comprised a canteen, reading rooms, offices, lavatories, a stage and gymnasium. Tents were erected in the surrounding playing fields for the soldiers. In 1917 the hall was converted for use as a hospital for recovering soldiers. The hall was given to the village of Lamlash after World War I on the condition that it be used again when necessary for troops. This indeed happened during World War II when it was used as a troops' canteen. The community centre was demolished in 2010 following the opening of community facilities in the new Arran High School nearby. Economy  Employment  In common with the rest of the island the village's main industry is tourism. In Lamlash the public sector is also an important employer. Fisheries is no longer important; although the Clyde was once the finest fishery in Europe it is now all but gone. There are strictly speaking no fish left in the Clyde for commercial capture and the few fishermen left are reduced to scraping the seabed for scallops and prawns.  Harbour and lifeboat  Holy Isle from Lamlash According to Glasgow's Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, Lamlash Bay is a good natural harbour offering very good shelter. It has accommodated the Royal Navy Home Fleet and Atlantic Fleet. Lamlash has an RNLI Lifeboat station with a B class Atlantic 75 lifeboat, covering the inshore waters around the coast of Arran. In summer, there is a regular ferry service from Lamlash harbour to Holy Isle.  Lamlash Bay Community Marine Protected Area  On 20 September 2008 the so- called \\"Inshore Fishing Order 2008\\" entered into effect, prohibiting commercial and recreational fishing in the northern portion of Lamlash Bay, between Holy Island and the Margnaheglish neighborhood of Lamlash. This No Take Zone (NTZ) aims to protect Maerl seaweed beds and the regeneration of all marine life. It is hoped this NTZ will benefit the Lamlash economy by attracting scuba divers and by providing bigger and better catches for fishermen in the neighbouring overspill area. The prohibition area is defined as follows: from Mount Pleasant Farm () in a straight line in a south to southeasterly direction to Holy Isle West () thence in an easterly direction around the northern end of Holy Island by the mean high water mark of ordinary spring tides to Holy Isle East (); thence by a straight line in a north to north westerly direction to Hamilton Rock (); thence in a west to northwesterly direction by a straight line to Clauchlands Point (); and thence in a west to southwesterly direction by the mean high water mark of ordinary spring tides to Mount Pleasant Farm. The area includes both the sea and the seabed. This NTZ is the first one in Scotland. It is also the first time that statutory protection has been given to a marine area as a result of proposals being developed at a grassroots level; in this case after a long campaign by the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (C.O.A.S.T.), which represents 1600 islanders who wanted fishing banned to regenerate the seabed. Violation of the fishing ban can lead to an unlimited fine upon conviction on indictment. The whole remainder of Lamlash Bay is to become a Fisheries Management Area, focusing primarily on scallops. Press reports from the time that the NTZ was established show optimism that the creation of the Fisheries Management Area would soon follow. According to C.O.A.S.T. this was even a promise by the Scottish Government. But as of May 2010, it had still not happened. Also, the NTZ is still not marked. There is not one interpretation board to alert anglers. All this has led the Community of Arran Seabed Trust to call into question the government's commitment to the overall project. The NTZ and the Fisheries Management Area would jointly have been known as the \\"Lamlash Bay Community Marine Protected Area\\". The sea surrounding the south of Arran, including Lamlash, is now recognised as one of 31 Mature Conservation Marine Protected Areas in Scotland. The designated are includes the current No Take Zone in Lamlash Bay, but is not itself a No Take Zone.

It typically inhabits rainforests and dwells on trees. The yellow-throated day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.  Description  This lizard belongs to the medium-sized day geckos. Males can reach a total length of about 15 cm while females are often much smaller. The body colour is dark green or bluish green. On the snout there are two red transversal bars. One to three rust-coloured stripes may be present on the neck. On the back there are small brownish or reddish dots and spottings. The throat is light yellow and the ventral side is beige. P. flavigularis has blue eye rings.  Distribution  This species has a limited distribution. It is only known from the area around Andasibe on the east coast of Madagascar, about 100 km east of Antananarivo.  Habitat  P. flavigularis is found on banana trees and palms. Its original habitat are rainforests. The east coast of Madagascar has a humid and warm climate. throat of species  Diet  These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. They also like to lick soft, sweet fruit; pollen; and nectar.  Behaviour  Like most Phelsuma spec., this species can be quite quarrelsome and do not accept other males in their neighbourhood. In captivity, where the females cannot escape, the males can also sometimes seriously wound a female during courtship. In this case, the male and female must be separated immediately.  Care and maintenance in captivity  These animals should be housed in pairs and need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between 25 and 28 °C. The humidity should be maintained between 75 and 100%. In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moths, fruit flies, mealworms, and houseflies.  References  *Henkel, F.-W. and W.

Cladogram of the primates, showing a monophyly (the simians, in yellow), a paraphyly (the prosimians, in cyan, including the red patch), and a polyphyly (the night-active primates, the lorises and the tarsiers, in red). Phylogenetic groups: A monophyletic taxon (in yellow, the clade Sauropsida grouping \\"reptiles and birds\\") contains a common ancestor and all of its descendants. A paraphyletic taxon (in cyan, the \\"reptiles\\") contains its most recent common ancestor, but does not contain all the descendants of that ancestor. A polyphyletic taxon (in red, the group Haemothermia containing warm-blooded tetrapods) does not contain the most recent common ancestor of all its members. A polyphyletic group is a set of organisms, or other evolving elements, that have been grouped together but do not share an immediate common ancestor. The term is often applied to groups that share characteristics that appear to be similar but have not been inherited from common ancestors; these characteristics are known as homoplasies, and the development and phenomenon of homoplasies is known as convergent evolution. The arrangement of the members of a polyphyletic group is called a polyphyly. Alternatively, polyphyletic is simply used to describe a group whose members come from multiple ancestral sources, regardless of similarity of characteristics. For example, the biological characteristic of warm-bloodedness evolved separately in the ancestors of mammals and the ancestors of birds. Other polyphyletic groups are for example algae, C4 photosynthetic plants, and edentates. Many biologists aim to avoid homoplasies in grouping taxa together and therefore it is frequently a goal to eliminate groups that are found to be polyphyletic. This is often the stimulus for major revisions of the classification schemes. Researchers concerned more with ecology than with systematics may take polyphyletic groups as legitimate subject matter; the similarities in activity within the fungus group Alternaria, for example, can lead researchers to regard the group as a valid genus while acknowledging its polyphyly.. In recent research, the concepts of monophyly, paraphyly, and polyphyly have been used in deducing key genes for barcoding of diverse group of species.  Etymology  The term polyphyly, or polyphyletic, derives from the two ancient greek words (), meaning \\"many, a lot of\\", and (), meaning \\"genus, species\\", and refers to the fact that a polyphyletic group includes organisms (e.g., genera, species) arising from multiple ancestral sources. Conversely, the term monophyly, or monophyletic, builds on the ancient greek prefix (), meaning \\"alone, only, unique\\", and refers to the fact that a monophyletic group includes organisms consisting of all the descendants of a unique common ancestor. By comparison, the term paraphyly, or paraphyletic, uses the ancient greek prefix (), meaning \\"beside, near\\", and refers to the situation in which one or several monophyletic subgroups are left apart from all other descendants of a unique common ancestor.  Avoidance  In many schools of taxonomy, the existence of polyphyletic groups in a classification is discouraged. Monophyletic groups (that is, clades) are considered by these schools of thought to be the most important grouping of organisms. One reason for this view is that some clades are simple to define in purely phylogenetic terms without reference to clades previously introduced: a node-based clade definition, for example, could be \\"All descendants of the last common ancestor of species X and Y\\". On the other hand, polyphyletic groups can often be delimited in terms of clades, for example \\"the flying vertebrates consist of the bat, bird, and pterosaur clades\\". Because polyphyletic groups can frequently be defined as a sum of clades, they are usually considered less fundamental than monophyletic (single, whole) clades. A stronger reason is that grouping species monophyletically facilitates prediction far more than does polyphyletic grouping. For example, classifying a newly discovered grass in the monophyletic family Poaceae, the true grasses, immediately results in numerous predictions about its structure and its developmental and reproductive characteristics, inherited from the common ancestor of this family. In contrast, Linnaeus' assignment of plants with two stamens to the polyphyletic class Diandria, while practical for identification, turns out to be useless for prediction, since the presence of exactly two stamens has developed convergently in many groups. Predictive success is the touchstone by which theories are evaluated in all experimental sciences.  Polyphyletic species  Species have a special status in systematics as being an observable feature of nature itself and as the basic unit of classification. It is usually implicitly assumed that species are monophyletic (or at least paraphyletic). However hybrid speciation arguably leads to polyphyletic species. Hybrid species are a common phenomenon in nature, particularly in plants where polyploidy allows for rapid speciation.

Sore throat is usually caused by a viral infection or a group A streptococcus (GAS) bacterial infection. Other causes include pharyngitis (inflammation of the throat), tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils), or dehydration, which leads to the throat drying up. It can also result from trauma. The majority of sore throats are caused by a virus, for which antibiotics are not helpful. A strong association between antibiotic misuse and antibiotic resistance has been shown. For sore throat caused by bacteria (GAS), treatment with antibiotics may help the person get better faster, reduce the risk that the bacterial infection does not spread, prevent retropharyngeal abscesses and quinsy, and reduce the risk of other complications such as rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease. In most developed countries, post-streptococcal diseases have become far less common. For this reason, awareness and public health initiatives to promote minimizing the use of antibiotics for viral infections has become the focus. Approximately 35% of childhood sore throats and 5-25% of adults sore throats are caused by a bacterial infection from group A streptococcus. Sore throats that are \\"non-group A streptococcus\\" are assumed to be caused by a viral infection. Sore throat is a common reason for people to visit their primary care doctors and the top reason for antibiotic prescriptions by primary care practitioners such as family doctors. In the United States, about 1% of all visits to the hospital emergency department, physician office and medical clinics, and outpatient clinics are for sore throat (over 7 million visits for adults and 7 million visits for children per year). Definition A sore throat is the pain felt anywhere in the throat. Diagnosis The most common cause (80%) is acute viral pharyngitis, a viral infection of the throat. Other causes include other bacterial infections (such as group A streptococcus or streptococcal pharyngitis), trauma, and tumors. Gastroesophageal (acid) reflux disease can cause stomach acid to back up into the throat and also cause the throat to become sore. In children, streptococcal pharyngitis is the cause of 35-37% of sore throats. The symptoms of a viral infection and a bacterial infection may be very similar. Some clinical guidelines suggest that the cause of a sore throat is confirmed prior to prescribing antibiotic therapy and only recommend antibiotics for children who are at high risk of non-suppurative complications. A group A streptococcus infection can be diagnosed by throat culture or a rapid test. In order to perform a throat culture, a sample from the throat (obtained by swabbing) is cultured (grown) on a blood agar plate to confirm the presence of group A streptococcus. Throat cultures are effective for people who have a low bacterial count (high sensitivity), however, throat cultures usually take about 48 hours to obtain the results. Clinicians often also make treatment decisions based on the person's signs and symptoms alone. In the US, approximately 2/3rd of adults and half of children with sore throat are diagnosed based on symptoms and do not have testing for the presence of GAS to confirm a bacterial infection. Rapid tests to detect GAS (bacteria) give a positive or negative result that is usually based on a colour change on a test strip that contains a throat swab (sample). Test strips detect a cell wall carbohydrate that is specific to GAS by using an immunologic reaction. Rapid testing can be performed in the doctors office and usually takes 5-10 minutes for the test strip to indicate the result. Specificity for most rapid tests is approximately 95%, however sensitivity is about 85%. Although the use of rapid testing has been linked with an overall reduction in antibiotic prescriptions, further research is necessary to understand other outcomes such as safety, and when the person starts to feel better. Numerous clinical scoring systems (decision tools) have also been developed to support clinical decisions. Scoring systems that have been proposed include Centor's, McIsaac's, and the feverPAIN. A clinical scoring system is often used along with a rapid test. The scoring systems use observed signs and symptoms in order to determine the likelihood of a bacterial infection. Management Pain medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) help in the management of pain. The use of corticosteroids seems to increase the likelihood of resolution and reduce the level of pain. Antibiotics shorten the duration of pain symptoms by an average of about one day. It is not known whether antibiotics are effective for preventing recurrent sore throat. There is an old wives tale that having a hot drink can help with common cold and influenza symptoms, including sore throat, but there is only limited evidence to support this idea. If the sore throat is unrelated to a cold and is caused by for example tonsillitis, a cold drink may be helpful. There are also other medications like lozenges which can help people to cope with a sore throat. Without active treatment, symptoms usually last two to seven days. Statistics In the United States, there are about 2.4 million emergency department visits with throat-related complaints per year.

Description alt=A photo of a Miracle Piano Teaching System keyboard The Miracle Piano Teaching System consists of a keyboard, connecting cables, power supply, soft foot pedals, and software. The software comes either on 3.5\\" floppy disks for personal computers or on cartridges for video game consoles. After the supplied MIDI keyboard is connected to a console or computer and the included software is loaded, a user follows the on-screen notes. Its marketed value is as a tool to teach users to play the piano. It provides hundreds of lessons, and was advertised as the perfect adjunct to formal lessons. It was sold for US$500 and had low sales, in part due to its high price. It was released in the United States and in multiple regions of Europe. Some of the NES Miracle keyboards were later converted for PC use and the Nintendo Seal of Quality on these boards was covered up with a piece of plastic. With the exception of the metronome that is used in the Miracle system's lessons, the Miracle system does not ever generate sounds through the video game console hardware. All MIDI information from the console is converted into audio by the instrument's built-in ROM and played through the instrument's stereo speakers, allowing the keyboard to be used independently of the console. Features Game activities in the Miracle system (such as Robo Man, shown here) combine video gaming-type gameplay and practicing of musical skills. Students can learn to play classic piano, rock piano, or show tunes. The Miracle system assesses the player's ability to create custom lessons. Fun exercises were meant to make learning the piano seem less like a chore and more like playing a video game. Instead of using the traditional NES controller, the piano becomes the controller as players aim at targets in order to perfect their music skills. There are multiple games that students can play to help teach musical skills. One game is called Robo Man where the player has to press the correct keys at the right time to create a bridge. If they miss, Robo Man falls and the player loses. In the duck hunting game, the player has to press the keys that correspond to the positions of the ducks on a musical staff to shoot them. In the Ripchord game, players must press the correct combination of keys for a chord to land paratroopers onto a target. Successors Around 1995, technology from the Miracle system was incorporated into the Piano Discovery System, an interactive PC software application that works with any MIDI keyboard including the Miracle keyboard. By 1997, the Miracle product had been discontinued in favor of the Piano Discovery System. Reception The Miracle system failed commercially with its high price of , but it was overall well received by critics. Computer Gaming World liked the Miracle system's games and graphics, describing them as \\"not only entertaining and challenging, but they are also cleverly designed to reinforce the lessons\\". The magazine concluded, \\"everything that Software Toolworks promises about this system is true [but] there is still no substitute for parental involvement\\". David Wesley and Gloria Barczak mentioned that the system was praised by educators and that in 1990 it was the highest-rated third-party NES title by Nintendo's software review team. It was not well-suited to average gamers who lacked musical experience or who were not highly committed and dedicated to undertaking long-term electronic piano learning. PC Magazine mentioned the system as being easy to use and likely more patient than a live piano teacher though the system did not cover certain aspects of piano playing such as hand position. NPR personality Noah Adams begins his 1997 memoir Piano Lessons attempting to teach himself how to play through the use of Miracle for PC software, ultimately finding greater success by taking more traditional lessons.

At the time of his death, de Man was one of the most prominent literary critics in the United States—known particularly for his importation of German and French philosophical approaches into Anglo-American literary studies and critical theory. Along with Jacques Derrida, he was part of an influential critical movement that went beyond traditional interpretation of literary texts to reflect on the epistemological difficulties inherent in any textual, literary, or critical activity. This approach aroused considerable opposition, which de Man attributed to \\"resistance\\" inherent in the difficult enterprise of literary interpretation itself.  Biography  He began his teaching career in the United States at Bard College where he taught French literature. He completed his Ph.D. at Harvard University in 1960, then taught at Cornell University, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of Zurich. He joined the faculty in French and Comparative Literature at Yale University, where he was considered part of the Yale School of Deconstruction. At the time of his death from cancer, he was Sterling Professor of the Humanities and chairman of the Department of Comparative Literature at Yale. De Man oversaw the dissertations of Gayatri Spivak (at Cornell), Barbara Johnson (at Yale), Samuel Weber (at Cornell), and many other noted scholars. After his death, a researcher uncovered some two hundred previously unknown articles which de Man had written in his early twenties for Belgian collaborationist newspapers during World War II, some of them implicitly and two explicitly anti-Semitic. These, in combination with revelations about his domestic life and financial history, caused a scandal and provoked a reconsideration of his life and work. Early life Paul de Man was born to a family of artisans of nineteenth- century Belgium and by the time of his birth, his family was prominent among the new bourgeoisie in Antwerp. He was the son of Robert de Man, a manufacturer and Magdalena de Braey. His maternal great-grandfather was the noted Flemish poet Jan Van Beers, and the family spoke French at home. His uncle Henri de Man (Dutch: Hendrik) was a famous socialist theorist and politician, who became a Nazi-collaborator during World War II. He played an important part in the decisions made by De Man during the Nazi occupation of Belgium. Paul's father, Robert (\\"Bob\\") de Man, was a moderately successful businessman whose firm manufactured X-ray equipment. De Man's father and his mother, Madeleine, who were first cousins, married over the family's opposition. The marriage proved unhappy. De Man's early life was difficult and shadowed by tragedy. His mother Madeleine's first pregnancy with her oldest son Hendrik (\\"Rik,\\" b. 1915) coincided with the intense German bombings of World War I and strained her physical and mental health. The stillbirth of a daughter two years later pushed her into intermittent but lifelong suicidal depression. She was psychologically fragile and had to be watched. The family walked on eggshells and \\"Bob\\" de Man found solace with other women. In contrast to Rik, who was backward and a failure in school, Paul dealt with his difficult home life by becoming a brilliant student and accomplished athlete. He was enrolled in the Dutch-speaking cohort of boys admitted to the prestigious and highly competitive Royal Athenaeum of Antwerp. There, he followed his father's career path in choosing to study science and engineering, consistently receiving top marks in all subjects and graduating at the top of his class. He took no courses in literature or philosophy but developed a strong extracurricular interest in both as well as in religious mysticism. In 1936, his brother Rik de Man was killed at the age of 21 when his bicycle was struck by a train at a railroad crossing. The following year, it was Paul, then seventeen, who discovered the body of their mother, who had hanged herself a month before the anniversary of Rik's death. That fall Paul enrolled in the Free University of Brussels. He wrote for student magazines and continued to take courses in science and engineering. For stability he turned to his uncle Henri as a patron and surrogate emotional father, later on several occasions telling people Henri was his real father and his real father was his uncle. He fathered a son with Romanian-born Anaïde Baraghian, the wife of his good friend, Gilbert Jaeger. They lived in a menage à trois until August 1942, when Baraghian left her husband. Paul married her in 1944, and the couple had two more sons together. De Man, Baraghian and Jaeger fled to the south of France near the Spanish border when the Nazis occupied Belgium in 1940. Henri, who by then was a self-avowed fascist, welcomed the Nazi invaders, whom he saw as essential for instituting his brand of socialism. For a year, Henri de Man was appointed as de facto puppet Prime Minister of Belgium under the Nazis. Some believed that he used his influence to secure his nephew a position as an occasional cultural critic for Le Soir, the influential Belgian French-language newspaper. After contributing an essay, “The Jews in Present-Day Literature,” to Le Soir volé's notorious anti-Semitic attack of March 4, 1941, de Man became its official book reviewer and a cultural critic. Later he contributed to the Flemish daily Het Vlaamsche Land; both publications were vehemently anti-Semitic when under Nazi control. As a cultural critic, de Man would contribute hundreds of articles and reviews to these publications. His writings supported the Germanic ideology and the triumph of Germany in the war, while never referring directly to Hitler himself. In spite of that he maintained friendships with individual Jews., e.g. his contacts with G. Goriély, p. 142 and E. Sluszny, pp. 153, 154 Holding three different jobs, de Man became very highly paid, but he lost all three between November 1942 and April 1943, failures that resulted from a combination of losing a coup he had launched against one employer and his own incompetence as a businessman at another. After this, de Man went into hiding; the Belgian Resistance had now begun assassinating prominent Belgian pro- Nazis. He had lost his protection in late 1942, when Henri, mistrusted by his collaborators on the right and himself marked for death as a traitor by the Belgian Resistance, went into exile. De Man spent the rest of the war in seclusion reading American and French literature and philosophy and organizing a translation into Dutch of Moby Dick by Herman Melville, which he published in 1945. He would be interrogated by prosecutor Roger Vinçotte, but not charged after the war. Henri de Man was tried and convicted in absentia for treason; he died in Switzerland in 1953, after crashing his car into an oncoming train, an accident that was almost certainly a suicide. Post-war years In 1948, de Man left Belgium and emigrated to New York City. He had fled as an exile to avoid what became two trials for criminal and financial misdeeds (thefts of money from investors in a publishing company he ran) for which he was convicted in absentia to five years of imprisonment and heavy fines. Baraghian sailed with their three young sons to Argentina, where her parents had recently immigrated. De Man found work stocking books at the Doubleday Bookstore at New York City's Grand Central Station. From there he wrote to his friend Georges Bataille, a French philosopher, and through him, he met Dwight Macdonald, a key figure on the New York intellectual and literary scene. At Macdonald's apartment, de Man met the celebrated novelist Mary McCarthy. McCarthy recommended de Man to her friend Artine Artinian, a professor of French at Bard College, as a temporary replacement while Artinian spent the academic year of 1949–50 in France as a Fulbright fellow. > \\"De Man was to teach Mr. Artinian's courses, advise Mr. Artinian's advisees, > and move into Mr. Artinian's house. By December [1949], de Man had married > one of the advisees, a French major named Patricia Kelley, and when the > first Mrs. de Man turned up with their three young boys, Hendrik, Robert, > and Marc, in the spring of 1950, Patricia de Man [sic] was pregnant.\\" De Man persuaded the devastated Baraghian to accept a sum of money, agree to a divorce, and return to Argentina. She, however, surprised him when she left the eldest boy with him, while he surprised her when his first check proved worthless. The boy was raised by Kelley's parents while she took the younger ones back to Argentina with a promise of child support that de Man was never to honor. A heavily fictionalized account of this period of de Man's life is the basis of Henri Thomas's 1964 novel Le Parjure (The Perjurer). See also His life also provides the basis for Bernhard Schlink's 2006 novel, translated as \\"Homecoming\\". De Man married Kelley a first time in June 1950, but did not tell her that he had not actually gotten a divorce and that the marriage was bigamous. They underwent a second marriage ceremony in August 1960, when his divorce from Baraghian was finalized, and later had a third ceremony in Ithaca. In addition to their son, Michael, born while the couple was at Bard College, they had a daughter, Patsy. The couple remained together until de Man's death, aged 64, in New Haven, Connecticut. Academic career The de Mans moved to Boston, where Paul earned money teaching conversational French at Berlitz and did translations assisted by Patricia de Man; he also gave private French lessons to Harvard student Henry Kissinger, then running a small center and publication of his own. There, de Man met Harry Levin, the Harvard Professor of Comparative Literature, and \\"was invited to join an informal literary seminar that met at Levin's house (alongside, e.g., George Steiner and John Simon). By the fall of 1952, he was officially admitted to graduate study in comparative literature.\\" In 1954 someone sent Harvard an anonymous letter denouncing de Man as a wartime collaborator and questioning his immigration status (a letter not surviving, and known only on the basis of de Man's response to it). According to Harvard faculty members, de Man offered a thorough and more than satisfactory account of his immigration status and the nature of his political activities. While he was writing his dissertation, de Man was awarded a prestigious appointment at the Harvard Society of Fellows. In 1960, because his thesis was unsatisfactory to his mentors on several counts, and especially its philosophical approach, they were prepared to dismiss him, but he moved immediately to an advanced position at Cornell University, where he was highly valued. Peter Brooks, who was de Man's undergraduate student at Harvard, and later became his friend and colleague at Yale, wrote that rather than brand de Man as a confidence man, as his critics were inclined to do: > \\"One might consider this a story of remarkable survival and success > following the chaos of war, occupation, postwar migration, and moments of > financial desperation: without any degrees to his name, de Man had > impressed, among others, Georges Bataille, Macdonald, McCarthy, and Levin, > and entered the highest precincts of American academia. During the following > decade, he contributed nine articles to the newly established New York > Review: astute and incisive short essays on major European > writers—Hölderlin, Gide, Camus, Sartre, Heidegger, as well as Borges—that > display notable cultural range and critical poise. In 1966, de Man attended a conference on structuralism held at Johns Hopkins University, where Jacques Derrida delivered his celebrated essay, \\"Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences\\"; de Man and Derrida soon became fast friends. Both were to become identified with Deconstruction. De Man came to reflect the influence primarily of Heidegger and used deconstruction to study Romanticism, both English and German, as well as French literature, specifically the works of William Wordsworth, John Keats, Maurice Blanchot, Marcel Proust, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Friedrich Nietzsche, Immanuel Kant, G .W. F. Hegel, Walter Benjamin, William Butler Yeats, Friedrich Hoelderlin and Rainer Maria Rilke. Following an appointment to a professorship in Zurich, de Man returned to the United States in the 1970s to teach at Yale University, where he served for the rest of his career. At the time of his death of cancer at age 64, he was a Sterling Professor and chairman of the department of comparative literature at Yale. Contributions to literary theory Although de Man's work in the 1960s differs from his later deconstructive endeavors, considerable continuity can also be discerned. In his 1967 essay \\"Criticism and Crisis,\\" he argues that because literary works are understood to be fictions rather than factual accounts, they exemplify the break between a sign and its meaning: literature \\"means\\" nothing, but critics resist this insight: > \\"When modern critics think they are demystifying literature, they are in > fact being demystified by it. But since this necessarily occurs in the form > of a crisis, they are blind to what takes place within themselves. What they > call anthropology, linguistics, psychoanalysis, is nothing but literature > reappearing like the hydra's head in the very spot where it had been > suppressed. The human mind will go through amazing feats to avoid facing > 'the nothingness of human matters'.\\" The phrase \\"nothingness of human > matters\\" – le néant des choses humaines – is from a well-known passage about > the imagination from Rousseau's Julie ou La Nouvelle Héloïse (VI: VIII), > which asserts that human happiness lies only in desire and not fulfillment: > \\"The world of illusions is the only one worth inhabiting. Such is the vanity > of human matters, outside the realm of the Self-Created Being, that nothing > here is beautiful but what is not.\\" De Man would later observe that, due to this resistance to acknowledging that literature does not \\"mean\\", English departments had become \\"large organizations in the service of everything except their own subject matter\\" (\\"The Return to Philology\\"). He said that the study of literature had become the art of applying psychology, politics, history, philology or other disciplines to the literary text, in an effort to make the text \\"mean\\" something. Among the central threads running through de Man's work is his attempt to tease out the tension between rhetoric (which de Man uses as a term to mean figural language and trope) and meaning, seeking moments in the text where linguistic forces \\"tie themselves into a knot which arrests the process of understanding.\\"de Man, Paul, \\"Shelley Disfigured\\", in Bloom, Harold, et al. Deconstruction and Criticism (New York, Continuum: 1979), p. 44. De Man's earlier essays from the 1960s, collected in Blindness and Insight, represent an attempt to seek these paradoxes in the texts of New Criticism and move beyond formalism. One of De Man's central topoi is of the blindness on which these critical readings are predicated, that the \\"insight seems instead to have been gained from a negative movement that animates the critic's thought, an unstated principle that leads his language away from its asserted stand. . . as if the very possibility of assertion had been put into question.\\" Here de Man tries to undercut the notion of the poetic work as a unified, atemporal icon, a self-possessed repository of meaning freed from the intentionalist and affective fallacies. In de Man's argument, formalist and New Critical valorization of the \\"organic\\" nature of poetry is ultimately self-defeating: the notion of the verbal icon is undermined by the irony and ambiguity inherent within it. Form ultimately acts as \\"both a creator and undoer of organic totalities,\\" and \\"the final insight...annihilated the premises which led up to it.\\" In Allegories of Reading, de Man further explores the tensions arising in figural language in Nietzsche, Rousseau, Rilke, and Proust. In these essays, he concentrates on crucial passages which have a metalinguistic function or metacritical implications, particularly those where figural language has a dependency on classical philosophical oppositions (essence/accident, synchronic/diachronic, appearance/reality) which are so central to Western discourse. Many of the essays in this volume attempt to undercut figural totalization, the notion that one can control or dominate a discourse or phenomenon through metaphor. In de Man's discussion of Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy, for instance, he claims that \\"genetic\\" conceptions of history appearing in the text are undercut by the rhetorical strategies Nietzsche employs: \\"the deconstruction does not occur between statements, as in a logical refutation or a dialectic, but happens instead between, on the one hand, metalinguistic statements about the rhetorical nature of language and, on the other hand, a rhetorical praxis that puts these statements into question.\\" For de Man, an \\"Allegory of Reading\\" emerges when texts are subjected to such scrutiny and reveal this tension; a reading wherein the text reveals its own assumptions about language, and in so doing dictates a statement about undecidability, the difficulties inherent in totalization, their own readability, or the \\"limitations of textual authority.\\" De Man is also known for his readings of English and German romantic and post-romantic poetry and philosophy (The Rhetoric of Romanticism), and concise and deeply ironic essays. Specifically noteworthy is his critical dismantling of the Romantic ideology and the linguistic assumptions which underlie it. His arguments follow roughly as follows. First, de Man seeks to deconstruct the privileged claims in Romanticism of symbol over allegory, and metaphor over metonymy. In his reading, because of the implication of self-identity and wholeness which is inherent in the Romantics' conception of metaphor, when this self-identity decomposes, so also does the means of overcoming the dualism between subject and object, which Romantic metaphor sought to transcend. In de Man's reading, to compensate for this inability, Romanticism constantly relies on allegory to attain the wholeness established by the totality of the symbol. In addition, in his essay \\"The Resistance to Theory\\", which explores the task and philosophical bases of literary theory, de Man uses the example of the classical trivium of grammar, rhetoric, and logic to argue that the use of linguistic sciences in literary theory and criticism (i.e. a structuralist approach) was able to harmonize the logical and grammatical dimension of literature, but only at the expense of effacing the rhetorical elements of texts which presented the greatest interpretive demands. He posits that the resistance to theory is the resistance to reading, thus the resistance to theory is theory itself. Or the resistance to theory is what constitutes the possibility and existence of theory. Taking up the example of the title of Keats's poem The Fall of Hyperion, de Man draws out an irreducible interpretive undecidability which bears strong affinities to the same term in Derrida's work and some similarity to the notion of incommensurability as developed by Jean-François Lyotard in The Postmodern Condition and The Differend. De Man argues that the recurring motive of theoretical readings is to subsume these decisions under theoretical, futile generalizations, which are displaced in turn by harsh polemics about theory. Influence and legacy De Man's influence on literary criticism was considerable, in part through his numerous and vocal disciples. Although much of his work brought to bear insights on literature drawn from German philosophers such as Kant and Heidegger, De Man also closely followed developments in contemporary French literature, criticism, and theory. Much of de Man's work was collected or published posthumously. His book Resistance to Theory was virtually complete at the time of his death. A collection of essays, edited by his former Yale colleague Andrzej Warminski, was published by the University of Minnesota Press in 1996 under the title Aesthetic Ideology. Wartime journalism and posthumous controversies In August 1987, Ortwin de Graef, a Belgian graduate student at the University of Leuven, discovered some two hundred articles which de Man had written during World War II for Le Soir.For facsimiles of the articles, see In 1988, a conference on Paul de Man took place at the University of Antwerp. \\"On the last day, Jean Stengers, a historian at the Free University of Brussels, addressed a topic pointedly titled: \\"Paul de Man, a Collaborator?\\" Then Georges Goriely, professor emeritus of sociology at the Free University of Brussels, rose to deliver what he called \\"A Personal Testimony\\": > M. Goriely began by extolling de Man, whom he had known intimately in his > youth, as \\"a charming, humorous, modest, highly cultured\\" homme de lettres > renowned in Belgian literary circles during their youth. Then the professor > dropped his bombshell. De Man, he asserted, wasn't all that he appeared to > be. He was \\"completely, almost pathologically, dishonest,\\" a crook who had > bankrupted his family. \\"Swindling, forging, lying were, at least at the > time, second nature to him.\\" The European press was in an uproar. \\"There were stories in La Quinzaine Litteraire, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, The (Manchester) Guardian. Newsweek juxtaposed a photograph of de Man with another of Nazis on the march. Le Soir described him as 'an academic Waldheim.\\" De Man's disciples tried to portray the attacks on de Man as a cover for his critics' dislike of Deconstruction, alleging that the attacks were a ruse that used de Man's youthful errors as evidence of what they considered the decadence at the heart of the Continental thought behind de Man and his theories. The controversies quickly spread from the pages of scholarly journals to the broader media. The Chronicle of Higher Education and the front page of The New York Times exposed the sensational details of de Man's personal life, particularly the circumstances of his marriage and his difficult relationships with his children. In the most controversial and explicitly anti-semitic essay from this wartime journalism, titled \\"Jews in Contemporary Literature\\" (1941), de Man described how \\"[v]ulgar anti-semitism willingly takes pleasure in considering post-war cultural phenomenon (after the war of 14–18) as degenerate and decadent because they are [enjewished].\\"Paul de Man. \\"The Jews in Contemporary Literature.\\" Originally published in Le Soir (March 4, 1941), Martin McQuillan, translator, in Martin McQuillan, Paul de Man. USA (Routledge. 2001), pp. 127–29. He notes that > \\"Literature does not escape this lapidary judgement: it is sufficient to > discover a few Jewish writers under Latinized pseudonyms for all > contemporary production to be considered polluted and evil. This conception > entails rather dangerous consequences ... it would be a rather unflattering > appreciation of western writers to reduce them to being mere imitators of a > Jewish culture which is foreign to them.\\" The article claimed that contemporary literature had not broken from tradition as a result of the First World War and that > \\"the Jews cannot claim to have been its creators, nor even to have exercised > a preponderant influence over its development. On any closer examination, > this influence appears to have extraordinarily little importance since one > might have expected that, given the specific characteristics of the Jewish > Spirit, the later would have played a more brilliant role in this artistic > production.\\" The article concluded that \\"our civilization... [b]y keeping, in spite of Semitic interference in all aspects of European life, an intact originality and character... has shown that its basic character is healthy.\\" It concluded that \\"the creation of a Jewish colony isolated from Europe\\" as \\"a solution to the Jewish problem\\" would not entail any \\"deplorable consequences\\" for \\"the literary life of the west.\\" This is the only known article in which de Man pronounced such views so openly, though two or three other articles also accept without demurral the disenfranchisement and ostracization of Jews, as some contributors to Responses have noted. De Man's colleagues, students, and contemporaries tried to respond to his early writings and his subsequent silence about them in the volume Responses: On Paul de Man's Wartime Journalism (edited by Werner Hamacher, Neil Hertz, and Thomas Keenan; Nebraska, 1989). His longtime friend, Jacques Derrida, who was Jewish, published a long piece responding to De Man's critics, declaring: > \\"To judge, to condemn the work or the man on the basis of what was a brief > episode, to call for closing, that is to say, at least figuratively, for > censuring or burning his books is to reproduce the exterminating gesture > which one accuses de Man of not having armed himself against sooner with the > necessary vigilance. It is not even to draw a lesson that he, de Man, > learned to draw from the war.\\"; see also the \\"Critical Responses\\" in > Critical Inquiry 15 (Summer 1989, 765–811) and Derrida's reply, > \\"Biodegradables: Seven Diary Fragments\\", 812–873. Some readers objected to what they considered as Derrida's effort to relate criticism of de Man to the greater tragedy of extermination of the Jews.See, for example, Fredric Jameson lengthily defended de Man in Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism (1991), observing about de Man's critics that \\"it does not seem to me that North American intellectuals have generally had the kind of experience of history that would qualify them to judge the actions and choices of people under military occupation.\\"Fredric Jameson, 1991, Postmodernism, or The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. pp. 256–57 According to Jameson, the efforts to implicate de Man in the Holocaust hinged on a fundamental misunderstanding of Nazi anti-Semitism: > The exclusive emphasis on anti-Semitism ignores and politically neutralizes > its other constitutive feature in the Nazi period: namely, anticommunism. > [The] very possibility of the Judeocide was absolutely at one with and > inseparable from the anticommunist and radical right-wing mission of > National Socialism (...). But put this way, it seems at once clear that > DeMan was neither an anticommunist nor a right-winger: had he taken such > positions in his student days (...), they would have been public knowledge. Turning to the content and ideology of de Man's wartime journalism, Jameson contended that it was \\"devoid of any personal originality or distinctiveness,\\" simply rehearsing corporatist commonplaces found in a broad range of European political movements. From this, Jameson concluded that none of the wartime articles \\"had any relevance to Paul De Man, for whom the thing dramatically called 'collaboration' was simply a job, in a Europe henceforth and for the foreseeable future united and German, and who as long as I knew him personally was simply a good liberal.\\" Since the late 1980s, some of de Man's followers, many of them Jewish, have pointed out that de Man at no time in his life displayed personal animus against Jews. Shoshana Felman, recounted that > \\"about a year after the journalistic publication of his compromising > statement, he and his wife sheltered for several days in their apartment the > Jewish pianist Esther Sluszny and her husband, who were then illegal > citizens in hiding from the Nazis. During this same period, de Man was > meeting regularly with Georges Goriely, a member of the Belgian Resistance. > According to Goriely's own testimony, he never for one minute feared > denunciation of his underground activities by Paul de Man.\\"Shoshana Felman, > \\"Paul de Man's Silence\\", Critical Inquiry 15: 4 (Summer, 1989): 704–744 But, his disciples and defenders have failed to agree about the nature of de Man's silence about his wartime activities. His critics, on the other hand, point out that throughout his life de Man was not only passively silent but also engaged in an active coverup through lies and misdirections about his past. The question of de Man's personal history has continued to fascinate scholars, as evidenced by Evelyn Barish's 2014 biography The Double Life of Paul de Man. In an advance review published in Harper's Magazine, Christine Smallwood concludes that de Man, as portrayed by Barish, was: \\"a slippery Mr. Ripley, a confidence man, and a hustler who embezzled, lied, forged, and arreared his way to intellectual acclaim.\\" In response to these claims, Peter Brooks, who succeeded to de Man's post as Sterling professor at Yale, stated that some of Barish's accusations were overblown, identifying several errors in her footnotes: \\"One could do a review of Barish's footnotes that would cast many doubts on her scholarship\\". For example, he cites the footnote Barish provides to support her claim that in 1942 de Man planned to launch a Nazi literary magazine: \\"I shared this information, and it has since been previously published in Belgian sources not now available to me\\", noting that this sort of thing \\"does not pass any sort of muster.\\" Harvard professor Louis Menand, on the other hand, in his review in The New Yorker, finds Barish's biography important and credible, notwithstanding the presence of occasional errors and exaggerations. Menand writes \\"[h]er book is a brief for the prosecution. But it is not a hatchet job, and she has an amazing tale to tell. In her account, all guns are smoking. There are enough to stock a miniseries.\\" Works * Blindness and Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism. 1971. * Allegories of Reading: Figural Language in Rousseau, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Proust (), 1979. * Blindness and Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism. 2nd ed.

It borders (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Dachau, Freising, Erding, Ebersberg, Rosenheim, Miesbach, Bad Tölz-Wolfratshausen, Starnberg, Fürstenfeldbruck, and almost encircles (except for the west and northwest sides) district-free city Munich itself, which is the district seat. History The history of the region is connected to the city of Munich. The district was established in 1852 and underwent several changes due to the ongoing incorporation of municipalities into the city of Munich. In 1972 the constant shrinking of the district was compensated by adding nine municipalities from the former district of Wolfratshausen. Geography The district is located in the east and the south of the city Munich, mostly covering the moraine plain around Munich. In the south of the district the foothills of the Alps start, which also contain the highest elevation of the district, two hills 703 m above sea level in the municipality Schäftlarn. The lowest elevation with 471 m is near Unterschleißheim in the north of the district. The main river is the Isar, which also flows through the city of Munich. Coat of arms { - valign=top Coat of arms The left half of the coat of arms show the Bavarian blue-and- white lozenge symbols.

A film version, Under Milk Wood directed by Andrew Sinclair, was released in 1972, and another adaptation of the play, directed by Pip Broughton, was staged for television for the 60th anniversary in 2014. An omniscient narrator invites the audience to listen to the dreams and innermost thoughts of the inhabitants of the fictional small Welsh fishing village, Llareggub. They include Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard, relentlessly nagging her two dead husbands; Captain Cat, reliving his seafaring times; the two Mrs. Dai Breads; Organ Morgan, obsessed with his music; and Polly Garter, pining for her dead lover. Later, the town awakens and, aware now of how their feelings affect whatever they do, we watch them go about their daily business. Origins and development Background The Coach & Horses in Tenby, where Thomas is reputed to have been so drunk that he left his manuscript to Under Milk Wood on a stool. In 1931, the 17-year-old Thomas created a piece for the Swansea Grammar School magazine which included a conversation of Milk Wood stylings, with Mussolini, Wife, Mr. Pritchard and Mr. Ogmore. Some of its lines are similar to those that would later be found in Under Milk Wood. In 1933, Thomas talked at length with his mentor and friend, Bert Trick about creating a play about a Welsh town: \\"He read it to Nell and me in our bungalow at Caswell around the old Dover stove, with the paraffin lamps lit at night ... the story was then called Llareggub, which was a mythical village in South Wales, a typical village, with terraced houses with one ty bach to about five cottages and the various characters coming out and emptying the slops and exchanging greetings and so on; that was the germ of the idea which ... developed into Under Milk Wood.\\"Thomas, D.N. (2003) Dylan Remembered 1914-1934,p 165, Seren Laugharne and New Quay In 1938, Thomas suggested that a group of Welsh writers should prepare a verse-report of their \\"own particular town, village, or district.\\"Letter to Meurig Walters, written in Blashford, Hampshire, 28 March 1938 in Collected Letters. A few months later, in May 1938, the Thomas family moved to Laugharne, and lived there intermittently for just under two years until July 1941; they did not return to live in Laugharne until 1949.Thomas’ Collected Letters show that the family lived for eighteen months in Gosport Street and Sea View, Laugharne, between May 1938 and July 1940, and for three months in the Castle in 1941. They did not return to live in Laugharne until May 1949. The author Richard Hughes, who lived in Laugharne, has recalled that Thomas spoke with him in 1939 about writing a play about Laugharne, in which the villagers would play themselves. Four years later, in 1943, Thomas met again with Hughes, and this time outlined a play about a Welsh village certified as mad by government inspectors.Richard Hughes in Thomas D.N. (2004) Dylan Remembered 1935-1953 p75 Seren, and also Hughes' review of Under Milk Wood in the Sunday Times, 7 March 1954. The Thomas family moved to New Quay in September 1944 and left in July the following year. Thomas had previously visited the town whilst living in nearby Talsarn in 1942-1943, and had an aunt and cousins living there. He had written a New Quay pub poem, Sooner than you can water milk, in 1943. His biographers are in accord that Thomas' time in New Quay was one of the most productive of his adult life. Some of those who knew him well have said that he began writing Under Milk Wood in New Quay, including his first biographer and close friend, Constantine Fitzgibbon.Fitzgibbon, C. (1965) The Life of Dylan Thomas pp266-67, Little Brown. The play's first producer, Douglas Cleverdon, concurred, noting that Thomas \\"wrote the first half within a few months; then his inspiration seemed to fail him when he left New Quay.\\"Cleverdon, D. (1954) in the Radio Times, 22 January. It has to be said that Cleverdon is not consistent in his dating of work on the play. One of Thomas' closest friends and confidante, Ivy Williams of Brown's Hotel, Laugharne, has said \\"Of course, it wasn’t really written in Laugharne at all. It was written in New Quay, most of it.\\"in Thomas D.N. (2004) Dylan Remembered 1935-1953 p187, Seren. The writer and puppeteer, Walter Wilkinson, visited New Quay in 1947, and his essay on the town captures its character and atmosphere as Thomas would have found it two years earlier.W. Wilkinson (1948) Puppets in Wales, Bles. There were many milestones on the road to Llareggub, and these have been detailed by Walford Davies in his Introduction to the definitive edition of Under Milk Wood.Davies, W. and Maud, R. eds.(1995), Under Milk Wood: the Definitive Edition, Everyman. The most important of these was Quite Early One Morning, Thomas’ description of a walk around New Quay, broadcast by the BBC in 1945, and described by Davies as a \\"veritable storehouse of phrases, rhythms and details later resurrected or modified for Under Milk Wood.\\" One striking example from the broadcast is: :Open the curtains, light the fire, what are servants for? :I am Mrs. Ogmore Pritchard and I want another snooze. :Dust the china, feed the canary, sweep the drawing-room floor; :And before you let the sun in, mind he wipes his shoes. Davies concludes that \\"New Quay, so similar in many ways to Laugharne, was crucial in supplementing the gallery of characters Thomas had to hand for writing Under Milk Wood.\\"Thomas lists some of these characters in his letter of 29 August 1946 to Margaret Taylor. Fitzgibbon had come to a similar conclusion many years earlier, noting that Llareggub \\"resembles New Quay more closely [than Laugharne] and many of the characters derive from that seaside village in Cardiganshire...\\"The Life of Dylan Thomas, 1965 p237, Little Brown John Ackerman has also suggested that the story of the drowned village and graveyard of Llanina, just outside New Quay, \\"is the literal truth that inspired the imaginative and poetic truth\\" of Under Milk Wood.Ackerman, J. (1979) Welsh Dylan p127, Seren. Elba, South Leigh and Prague In April 1947, Thomas and family went to Italy. He intended to write a radio play there, as his letters home make clear.See the letters of 24 May, 29 May, 5 June, Collected Letters. Several words and phrases that appear in the play can be found in some of Thomas’ letters from the island of Elba, where he stayed for three weeks. They mention the \\"fishers and miners\\" and \\"webfooted waterboys\\" who we later find as the \\"fishers\\" and \\"webfoot cocklewomen\\" of the first page of Under Milk Wood.The \\"cocklewomen webfoot\\" also appear in Thomas’ letter to Margaret Taylor written in South Leigh in October 1948, Collected Letters. The \\"sunblack\\" and \\"fly-black\\" adjectives of Elba would be re-worked as the \\"crowblack\\" and \\"bible-black\\" descriptions of Llareggub. Alfred Pomeroy Jones, sea-lawyer, \\"died of blisters\\", and so, almost, did Thomas, as he vividly describes in a letter home.See his letter of 3 August 1947 from Elba, Collected Letters. And, in time, the island's \\"blister-biting blimp-blue bakehouse sea\\" would re-appear as Llareggub's \\"slow, black, crowblack, fishingboat-bobbing sea.\\" On their return from Italy in August 1947, the Thomases moved to South Leigh in Oxfordshire, where Thomas declared his intent to work further on the play.See his letter to his parents, 19 July 1947, which reads: \\"I want very much to write a full-length – hour to an hour & a half – broadcast play; & hope to do it, in South Leigh, this autumn.\\" And another to John Ormond 6 March 1948: \\"A radio play I am writing has Laugharne, though not by name, as its setting.\\" It was here that he knocked the play into shape, as one biographer described it.Lycett, A. (2004) Thomas Untutored in Oxford Today, 16, 2, Hilary. There are various accounts of his work on the play at South Leigh, where he lived until May 1949.Thomas, D. N. (2004) Dylan Remembered 1934-1953, pp294-295, Seren, and also at South Leigh He also worked on filmscripts here, including Three Weird Sisters, in which we find the familiar Llareggub names of Daddy Waldo and Polly Probert. Just a month or so after moving to South Leigh, Thomas met with the BBC producer, Philip Burton, in the Café Royal in London, where he outlined his ideas for \\"The Village of the Mad…a coastal town in south Wales which was on trial because they felt it was a disaster to have a community living in that way… For instance, the organist in the choir in the church played with only the dog to listen to him…A man and a woman were in love with each other but they never met… they wrote to each other every day…And he had the idea that the narrator should be like the listener, blind.…\\"(1) Burton, P. (1953) untitled, Dylan Thomas Memorial Number in Adam International Review. (2) Tape recorded interview in the Jeff Towns Collection. (3) Letters to Douglas Cleverdon, 9 October 1967 and 26 February 1968 Burton’s friendship with Thomas, and his influence on the play, has been set within the context of his work at the BBC in developing community portraiture on the radio.Thomas, D.N. (2020) Under Milk Wood: A Play for Ears. Some Reflections on T. Rowland Hughes, Philip Burton and Dylan Thomas, New Welsh Review, May. And online at Burton and Thomas Thomas went to Prague in March 1949 for a writers’ conference. His guide and interpreter, Jiřina Hauková, has recalled that, at a party, Thomas \\"narrated the first version of his radio play Under Milk Wood\\". She mentions that he talked about the organist who played to goats and sheep, as well as a baker with two wives.The lines about Organ Morgan playing for nobody and playing for sheep are both found at the very end of the play. See Davies and Maud op. cit. p61. Another at the party remembered that Thomas also talked about the two Voices.Thomas, D. N. (2004) Dylan Remembered 1934-1953, pp160-164 and 295-296, Seren, and also at wood Prague. Taken from Hauková's Memoirs: Záblesky života (1996), H&H;, Jinočany. The testimony from Prague, when taken with that of Burton about the meeting in the Café Royal in 1947, indicates that several of the characters of the play were already in place by the time Thomas had moved to the Boat House in Laugharne in May 1949: the organist, the two lovers who never met but wrote to each other, the baker with two wives, the blind narrator and the Voices. The first known sighting of a script for the play was its first half, titled The Town that was Mad, which Thomas showed to the poet Allen Curnow in October 1949 at the Boat House. Curnow, A. (1982) Images of Dylan, NZ Listener, 8 December. A draft first half of the play was delivered to the BBC in October 1950; it consisted of thirty-five handwritten pages containing most of the places, people and topography of Llareggub, and which ended with the line \\"Organ Morgan's at it early…\\" A shortened version of this first half was published in Botteghe Oscure in May 1952. By the end of that year, Thomas had been in Laugharne for just over three years, but his half- play had made little progress since his South Leigh days. On 6 November 1952, he wrote to the editor of Botteghe Oscure to explain why he hadn't been able to \\"finish the second half of my piece for you.\\" He had failed shamefully, he said, to add to \\"my lonely half of a looney maybe-play\\".See his various letters 1950-1953 about failing to work on the play e.g. his 6 January 1953 letter to Gwyn Jones: \\"I've been terribly busy failing to write one word of a more or less play set in a Wales that I'm sad to say never was…\\" He wrote to Charles Fry in February 1953, complaining that, apart from the 'Prologue' for Collected Poems, he had not been able to write anything for a whole year. A memo from David Higham, his agent, also in February 1953, noted tersely: \\"He hasn't made any progress on the Llareggub things.\\"  America  Thomas gave a reading of the unfinished play to students at Cardiff University in March 1953. On 10 March, at the university. For an account by the journalist Alan Road, see Thomas, D.N. (2004) Dylan Remembered 1935-1953 p. 302. He then travelled to America in April to give the first public readings of the play, even though he had not yet written its second half. He gave a solo reading of the first half on 3 May at the Fogg Museum, Harvard, where the audience responded enthusiastically. For an account, see Thomas, D.N. op. cit. p. 304 Rehearsals for the play's premiere on 14 May had already started but with only half the play, and with Thomas unavailable as he left to carry out a series of poetry readings and other engagements. He was up at dawn on 14 May to work on the second half, and he continued writing on the train between Boston and New York, as he travelled to the Poetry Centre there for the premiere. With the performance just ninety minutes away, the \\"final third of the play was still unorganised and but partially written.\\" The play's producer, Liz Reitell, locked Thomas in a room to continue work on the script, the last few lines of which were handed to the actors as they were preparing to go on stage. Thomas subsequently added some forty new lines to the second half for the play's next reading in New York on 28 May.Brinnin, J. (1955) Dylan Thomas in America, pp211-213, Avon On his return to Laugharne, Thomas worked in a desultory fashion on Under Milk Wood throughout the summer.Desultory: Davies and Maud, op.cit. p82. He gave readings of the play in Porthcawl and Tenby, before travelling to London to catch his plane to New York for another tour, including three readings of Under Milk Wood. He stayed with the comedian Harry Locke, and worked on the play, re-writing parts of the first half, and writing Eli Jenkins' sunset poem and Waldo's chimmney sweep song for the second half.Thomas, D.N. op. cit. p306 On 15 October 1953, he delivered another draft of the play to the BBC, a draft that his producer, Douglas Cleverdon, described as being in \\"an extremely disordered state...it was clearly not in its final form.\\"Cleverdon, D. (1969) The Growth of Milk Wood pp35-38 On his arrival in New York on 20 October 1953, Thomas added a further thirty-eight lines to the second half, for the two performances on 24 and 25 October. After the first performance on 24 October, Thomas was close to collapse, standing in his dressing room, clinging to the back of a chair. The play, he said, \\"has taken the life out of me for now.\\"Becker, R., A Memoir, in the Constantine Fitzgibbon archive, Harry Ransom Centre, University of Texas at Austin. At the next performance, the actors realised that Thomas was \\"desperately ill\\" and had lost his voice. After a cortisone injection, he recovered sufficiently to go on stage. Through the following week, Thomas continued to work on the script for the version that was to appear in Mademoiselle, and for the performance in Chicago on 13 November. He collapsed in the early hours of 5 November and, after a long delay, he was taken in a coma to St. Vincent's Hospital and died there on 9 November 1953. Negligence on the part of both his New York doctor, Milton Feltenstein, and his American literary agent, John Brinnin, is implicated in his death.An account of Thomas' death can be found in Thomas, D.N. (2008) Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas?, Seren, with summaries at dylan's death. Thomas was already ill when he arrived in America, and using an inhaler to help his breathing. A course of penicillin would have taken care of his developing chest disease but Feltenstein injected morphine, sending Thomas into a coma from which he never recovered. John Brinnin, deeply in debt and desperate for money, failed in his duty of care.see Thomas, D.N. (2008) Fatal Neglect: Who Killed Dylan Thomas?, Seren pp7-48. He knew Thomas was very ill, but did not cancel or curtail his programme, a punishing schedule of four rehearsals and two performances of Under Milk Wood in just five days, as well as two sessions of revising the play.The play’s cast noticed Thomas’ worsening illness during the first three rehearsals, during one of which he collapsed. Brinnin was at the fourth and was shocked by Thomas’ appearance: \\"I could barely stop myself from gasping aloud. His face was lime-white, his lips loose and twisted, his eyes dulled, gelid, and sunk in his head.\\" Inspiration The inspiration for the play has generated intense debate. Thomas himself declared on two occasionsLetters to John Ormond 6 March 1948 and Princess Caetani, October 1951 that his play was based on Laugharne, but this has not gone unquestioned. Llansteffan, Ferryside and particularly New Quay also have their claims. An examination of these respective claims was published in 2004.Thomas, D.N. (2004) Dylan Remembered 1935-1953, chapter 2, Seren, and at the play's inspiration Surprisingly little scholarship has been devoted to Thomas and Laugharne, and about the town's influence on the writing of Under Milk Wood.But see (1) Davies, J.A. (2000) Dylan Thomas’s Swansea, Gower and Laugharne, University of Wales Press. (2) Tregenna, J. (2014) If He Were Still With Us (Dylan’s Laugharne – Still Strange), Bloomsbury. (3) Lewis, M. (1967) Laugharne and Dylan Thomas, Dobson. Thomas’ four years at the Boat House were amongst his least productive, and he was away for much of the time. As his daughter, Aeronwy, has recalled, \\"he sought any pretext to escape.\\"Of his four years at the Boat House, more than a quarter were spent in America and Persia, and much of the rest in London or travelling the country to read poetry or to broadcast on the radio. Aeronwy's comment: A. Thomas (2009) p21 The topography of Llareggub is thought to be based on New Quay.Cleverdon, D. (1969) The Growth of Milk Wood, p4 Dent. Cleverdon, who produced the first BBC broadcast in 1954, wrote that Llareggub's topography \\"is based not so much on Laugharne, which lies on the mouth of an estuary, but rather on New Quay, a seaside town...with a steep street running down to the harbour.\\" Thomas drew a sketch map of the fictional town. This is now at the National Library of Wales and can be viewed online.Dylan's Llareggub map at The National Library of Wales's website. The various topographical references in the play to the top of the town, and to its ‘top and sea-end’ are suggestive of New Quay, as are Llareggub's harbour, sea-going history, terraced streets, hill of windows and quarry.There are a number of available publications about the town’s maritime history: and residents. (1) S. Passmore (2012) Farmers and Figureheads: the Port of New Quay and its Hinterland, Grosvenor House. (2) R. Bryan (2012) New Quay: A History in Pictures, Llanina Books. (3) W. J. Lewis (1987) New Quay and Llanarth, Aberystwyth. Llareggub’s occupational profile as a town of seafarers, fishermen, cockle gatherers and farmers has been examined through an analysis of the returns in the 1939 War Register for New Quay, Laugharne, Ferryside and Llansteffan.Thomas, D.N. (2019) Llareggub and the 1939 War Register, at Llareggub-and-the-1939-war-register Thomas is reported to have commented that Under Milk Wood was developed in response to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, as a way of reasserting the evidence of beauty in the world. It is also thought that the play was a response by Thomas both to the Nazi concentration camps, and to the internment camps that had been created around Britain during World War II.See Dylan-and-the-town-that-was-mad Llareggub A boat bearing the name of the fictional location of Under Milk Wood The fictional name Llareggub was derived by reversing the phrase \\"bugger all\\". In early published editions of the play, it was often rendered (contrary to Thomas's wishes) as Llaregyb or similar. It is pronounced .For example see by Welsh actor Richard Burton, at time 0:39 The name bears some resemblance to many actual Welsh place names, which often begin with Llan, meaning church or, more correctly, sanctified enclosure, although a double g is not used in written Welsh. The name Llareggub was first used by Thomas in a short story The Burning BabyThe Burning Baby. Dated October 1934 in the \\"Red Notebook\\" and first published in the magazine Contemporary Poetry and Prose, issue for May 1936. This information listed by Walford Davies in Dylan Thomas: Collected Stories. Phoenix, 2000. published in 1936. (\\"Death took hold of his sister's legs as she walked through the calf-high heather up the hill... She was to him as ugly as the sowfaced woman Llareggub who had taught him the terrors of the flesh.\\") The play had usually been titled The Village of the Mad or The Town that was Mad. By summer of 1951, Thomas was calling the play Llareggub HillJ. Brinnin (1955) Dylan Thomas in America, Avon p132 but by October 1951, when the play was sent to Botteghe Oscure, its title had become Llareggub. A piece for Radio Perhaps. By the summer of 1952, the title was changed to Under Milk Wood because John Brinnin thought Llareggub Hill would be too thick and forbidding to attract American audiences. In the play, the Rev Eli Jenkins writes a poem that describes Llareggub Hill and its \\"mystic tumulus\\". This was based on a lyrical description of Twmbarlwm's \\"mystic tumulus\\" in Monmouthshire that Thomas imitated from Arthur Machen's autobiography Far Off Things (1922).Dylan Thomas, Under Milk Wood, The Definitive Edition (Dent: 1995), p. 91. The town's name is the inspiration for the country of Llamedos (sod 'em all) in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novel Soul Music. In this setting, Llamedos is a parody of Wales. Plot The play opens at night, when the citizens of Llareggub are asleep. The narrator (First Voice/Second Voice) informs the audience that they are witnessing the townspeople's dreams. Captain Cat, the blind sea captain, is tormented in his dreams by his drowned shipmates, who long to live again and enjoy the pleasures of the world. Mog Edwards and Myfanwy Price dream of each other; Mr. Waldo dreams of his childhood and his failed marriages; Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard dreams of her deceased husbands. Almost all of the characters in the play are introduced as the audience witnesses a moment of their dreams. Morning begins. The voice of a guide introduces the town, discussing the facts of Llareggub. The Reverend Eli Jenkins delivers a morning sermon on his love for the village. Lily Smalls wakes and bemoans her pitiful existence. Mr. and Mrs. Pugh observe their neighbours; the characters introduce themselves as they act in their morning. Mrs. Cherry Owen merrily rehashes her husband's drunken antics. Butcher Beynon teases his wife during breakfast. Captain Cat watches as Willy Nilly the postman goes about his morning rounds, delivering to Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard, Mrs. Pugh, Mog Edwards and Mr. Waldo. At Mrs. Organ-Morgan's general shop, women gossip about the townspeople. Willy Nilly and his wife steam open a love letter from Mog Edwards to Myfanwy Price; he expresses fear that he may be in the poor house if his business does not improve. Mrs. Dai Bread Two swindles Mrs. Dai Bread One with a bogus fortune in her crystal ball. Polly Garter scrubs floors and sings about her past paramours. Children play in the schoolyard; Gwennie urges the boys to \\"kiss her where she says or give her a penny.\\" Gossamer Beynon and Sinbad Sailors privately desire each other. During dinner, Mr. Pugh imagines poisoning Mrs. Pugh. Mrs. Organ-Morgan shares the day's gossip with her husband, but his only interest is the organ. The audience sees a glimpse of Lord Cut-Glass's insanity in his \\"kitchen full of time\\". Captain Cat dreams of his lost lover, Rosie Probert, but weeps as he remembers that she will not be with him again. Nogood Boyo fishes in the bay, dreaming of Mrs. Dai Bread Two and geishas. On Llareggub Hill, Mae Rose Cottage spends a lazy afternoon wishing for love. Reverend Jenkins works on the White Book of Llareggub, which is a history of the entire town and its citizens. On the farm, Utah Watkins struggles with his cattle, aided by Bessie Bighead. As Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard falls asleep, her husbands return to her. Mae Rose Cottage swears that she will sin until she explodes. The Sailor's Home Arms, New Quay, now known as the Seahorse Inn, which provided the name for the Sailors Arms. As night begins, Reverend Jenkins recites another poem. Cherry Owen heads to the Sailor's Arms, where Sinbad still longs for Gossamer Beynon. The town prepares for the evening, to sleep or otherwise. Mr. Waldo sings drunkenly at the Sailors Arms. Captain Cat sees his drowned shipmates—and Rosie—as he begins to sleep. Organ-Morgan mistakes Cherry Owen for Johann Sebastian Bach on his way to the chapel. Mog and Myfanwy write to each other before sleeping. Mr. Waldo meets Polly Garter in a forest. Night begins and the citizens of Llareggub return to their dreams again. Characters *Captain Cat – The old blind sea captain who dreams of his deceased shipmates and lost lover Rosie Probert.

Publication and translation The first publication of Under Milk Wood, a shortened version of the first half of the play, appeared in Botteghe Oscure in April 1952. Two years later, in February 1954, both The Observer newspaper and Mademoiselle magazine published abridged versions. The first publications of the complete play were also in 1954: J. M. Dent in London in March and New Directions in America in April. An Acting Edition of the play was published by Dent in 1958. The Definitive Edition, with one Voice, came out in 1995, edited by Walford Davies and Ralph Maud. A Project Gutenberg of Australia eBook for free use went online in November 2006, produced by Colin Choat. The first translation was published in November 1954 by Drei Brücken Verlag in Germany, as Unter dem Milchwald, translated by Erich Fried. A few months later, in January 1955, the play appeared in the French journal Les Lettres Nouvelles as Le Bois de Lait, translated by Roger Giroux, with two further instalments in February and March. For details on the play’s publication in Botteghe Oscure, The Observer, Mademoiselle and Les Lettres Nouvelles, see R. Maud (1970) Dylan Thomas in Print, which also gives details of Erich Fried’s translation. Over the next three years, Under Milk Wood was published in Dutch, Polish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Swedish, Japanese and Italian. It’s estimated that it has now been translated into over thirty languages, including Welsh with a translation by T. James Jones, (Jim Parc Nest), published in 1968 as Dan Y Wenallt. For an interview with Jones, see Jones The original manuscript of the play was lost by Thomas in a London pub, a few weeks before his death in 1953. The alleged gift of the manuscript, to BBC producer Douglas Cleverdon, formed the subject of litigation in Thomas v Times Book Co (1966) which is a leading case on the meaning of gift in English property law.

Macmillan 1985. Footnote by editor. Thomas himself read the parts of the First Voice and the Reverend Eli Jenkins. Almost as an afterthought, the performance was recorded on a single-microphone tape recording (the microphone was laid at front center on the stage floor) and later issued by the Caedmon company. It is the only known recorded performance of Under Milk Wood with Thomas as a part of the cast. A studio recording, planned for 1954, was precluded by Thomas's death in November 1953.\\"Dylan Thomas Unabridged: The Caedmon Collection\\", Green Man Review. The BBC first broadcast Under Milk Wood, a new \\"'Play for Voices\\", on the Third Programme on 25 January 1954 (two months after Thomas's death), although several sections were omitted. The play was recorded with a distinguished, all-Welsh cast including Richard Burton as 'First Voice', with production by Douglas Cleverdon. A repeat was broadcast two days later. Daniel Jones, the Welsh composer who was a lifelong friend of Thomas's (and his literary trustee), wrote the music; this was recorded separately, on 15 and 16 January, at Laugharne School. The play won the Prix Italia award for radio drama that year.Prix Italia \\"PAST EDITIONS — WINNERS 1949 – 2007\\" There were other notable productions in 1954: *14 February: extracts from the play read at the Dylan Thomas Memorial Recital at the Royal Festival Hall, London.

BBC Genome BBC Genome *November: the first stage performance, held at the Théâtre de la Cour Saint-Pierre, Geneva, by Phoenix Productions, with props lent by the BBC.The Stage, 18 November 1954 and The Western Mail 15 November 1954. The following year, 1955, saw the first British stage production, on 13 August, at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle, the first production at the Edinburgh Festival on 21 August and, on 20 September, the first London West End stage production (at the New Theatre). The first attempt to bring the play to the screen occurred in May 1957 when the BBC broadcast a televised version narrated by Donald Houston. In 1963, the original radio producer, Douglas Cleverdon, revisited the project and recorded the complete play, which was broadcast on 11 October 1963. In 1971, Under Milk Wood was performed at Brynmawr Comprehensive School. The production was entirely the work of pupils at the school - from set design, to lighting and direction. With very few exceptions, every character was acted by a different player to allow as many pupils as possible to take part. Scheduled for only one performance - it ran for a week. The 1972 film adaptation, with Burton reprising his role, also featured Elizabeth Taylor, Peter O'Toole, Glynis Johns, Vivien Merchant and other well- known actors, including Ryan Davies as the \\"Second Voice\\". It was filmed on location in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, and at Lee International Film Studios, London. In 1988, George Martin produced an album version, featuring more of the dialogue sung, with music by Martin and Elton John, among others; Anthony Hopkins played the part of \\"First Voice\\". This was subsequently produced as a one-off stage performance (as An Evening with Dylan Thomas) for The Prince's Trust in the presence of HRH Prince Charles, to commemorate the opening in December 1992 of the new AIR Studios at Lyndhurst Hall. It was again produced by Martin and directed by Hopkins, who once again played 'First Voice'. Other roles were played by Harry Secombe, Freddie Jones, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Siân Phillips, Jonathan Pryce, Alan Bennett and, especially for the occasion, singer Tom Jones. The performance was recorded for television (directed by Declan Lowney) but has never been shown. In 1992, Brightspark Productions released a 50-minute animation version, using an earlier BBC soundtrack with Burton as narrator. This was commissioned by S4C (a Welsh-language public service broadcaster). Music was composed specially by Trevor Herbert and performed by Treorchy Male Voice Choir and the Welsh Brass Consort. Producer Robert Lyons. Director, Les Orton. It was made by Siriol Productions in association with Onward Productions and BBC Pebble Mill. This was released on DVD in October 2008. DVD ref: 5 037899 005798. In February 1994, Guy Masterson premiered a one-man physical version of the unabridged text at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh playing all 69 characters. This production returned for the subsequent Edinburgh International Fringe Festival and sold out its entire run. It has since played over 2000 times globally. In 1997, Australian pianist and composer Tony Gould's adaptation of Under Milk Wood (written for narrator and chamber orchestra) was first performed by actor John Stanton and the Queensland Philharmonic Orchestra.. In November 2003, as part of their commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of Thomas's death, the BBC broadcast a new production of the play, imaginatively combining new actors with the original 1954 recording of Burton playing \\"First Voice\\". (Broadcast 15 November 2003, BBC Radio 4; repeated 24 December 2004.) Digital noise reduction technology allowed Burton's part to be incorporated unobtrusively into the new recording, which was intended to represent Welsh voices more realistically than the original. In 2006, Austrian composer Akos Banlaky composed an opera with the libretto based on the German translation by Erich Fried (Unter dem Milchwald, performed at Tiroler Landestheater in Innsbruck, Austria). In 2008, French composer composed an opera, Au Bois lacté, based on his own translation and adaptation of Under Milk Wood. It was created at the Opéra-Théâtre in Metz, France, with staging by Antoine Juliens. The work is for twelve singers, large mixed choir, children choir, accordion, dancer and electronics sounds. In 2008, a ballet version of Under Milk Wood by Independent Ballet Wales toured the UK. It was choreographed by Darius James with music by British composer Thomas Hewitt Jones. A suite including music from the ballet was recorded by Court Lane Music in 2009. In 2009 and 2010 a translation in Dutch by the Belgian writer Hugo Claus was performed on stage by Jan Decleir and Koen De Sutter on a theatre tour in Belgium and the Netherlands (e.g. the Zeeland Late-Summer Festival, the Vooruit in Ghent, etc.). In 2010, a one-woman production of the text was performed at the Sidetrack Theatre in Sydney, Australia, presented by Bambina Borracha Productions and directed by Vanessa Hughes. Actress Zoe Norton Lodge performed all 64 characters in the play.Reviewed by John Rozentals, Oz Baby Boomers, 5 July 2010. In July 2011, Progress Youth Theatre (Reading, Berkshire, UK) performed a stage adaptation of the radio script. All visual aspects, such as stage directions, costume, set and lighting design were therefore devised entirely by the youth theatre. The voice parts were shared equally among seven actors, with other actors playing multiple \\"named\\" parts (with the exception of Captain Cat, who remained on stage throughout the production). The BBC Formula 1 introduction to the 2011 Singapore Grand Prix featured extracts of the audio for their opening VT. In 2012, the Sydney Theatre Company staged a production starring Jack Thompson as First Voice and Sandy Gore as Second Voice, with a cast including Bruce Spence, Paula Arundell, Drew Forsythe, Alan John, Drew Livingston and Helen Thomson.Lloyd Bradford Syke, \\"Review: Under Milk Wood  Drama Theatre, Sydney\\", Crikey, 29 May 2012. The production was staged in the Drama Theatre of the Sydney Opera House. In 2012, Gould's 1997 adaptation of Under Milk Wood (written for narrator and chamber orchestra) was again performed by actor John Stanton as part of the Victorian College of the Arts Secondary School's inaugural performance at the Melbourne Recital Centre. Gould played piano and worked with the students as a musical mentor. Guy Masterson of Theatre Tours International has produced and performed a solo version of the play over 2000 times since its world premiere in 1994. It has been performed at the Edinburgh Festival in 1994, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2007 and 2010; in Adelaide, Australia in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2012; and in London's West End Arts Theatre. In 2014, Pip Broughton directed an adaptation of the play for the BBC, starring Michael Sheen, Tom Jones, and Jonathan Pryce. In October 2014, the BBC launched an interactive ebook entitled Dylan Thomas: The Road To Milk Wood, written by Jon Tregenna and Robin Moore. It deals with the journey from Swansea via the BBC to New York City and beyond. Quotations One of many articles celebrating the work of Dylan Thomas.

For scholarly purposes, \\"proper\\" bimetallism is sometimes distinguished as permitting that both gold and silver money are legal tender in unlimited amounts and that gold and silver may be taken to be coined by the government mints in unlimited quantities.. This distinguishes it from \\"limping standard\\" bimetallism, where both gold and silver are legal tender but only one is freely coined (e.g. the moneys of France, Germany, and the United States after 1873), and from \\"trade\\" bimetallism, where both metals are freely coined but only one is legal tender and the other is used as \\"trade money\\" (e.g. most moneys in western Europe from the 13th to 18th centuries). Economists also distinguish legal bimetallism, where the law guarantees these conditions, and de facto bimetallism, where gold and silver coins circulate at a fixed rate. During the 19th century there was a great deal of scholarly debate and political controversy regarding the use of bimetallism in place of a gold or silver standard (monometallism). Bimetallism was intended to increase the supply of money, stabilize prices, and facilitate setting exchange rates.. Some scholars argued that bimetallism was inherently unstable owing to Gresham's law, and that its replacement by a monometallic standard was inevitable. Other scholars claimed that in practice bimetallism had a stabilizing effect on economies. The controversy became largely moot after technological progress and the South African and Klondike Gold Rushes increased the supply of gold in circulation at the end of the century, ending most of the political pressure for greater use of silver. It became completely academic after the 1971 Nixon shock; since then, all of the world's currencies have operated as more or less freely floating fiat money, unconnected to the value of silver or gold. Nonetheless, academics continue to debate, inconclusively, the relative use of the metallic standards. Historical creation From the 7th century BCE, Asia Minor, especially in the areas of Lydia and Ionia, is known to have created a coinage based on electrum, a natural occurring material that is a variable mix of gold and silver (with about 54% gold and 44% silver). Before Croesus, his father Alyattes had already started to mint various types of non-standardized electrum coins. They were in use in Lydia and surrounding areas for about 80 years. The unpredictability of its composition implied that it had a variable value which was very hard to determine, which greatly hampered its development. Croeseids Croeseid bimetallic equivalence: 1 gold Croeseid of 8.1 grams was equivalent in value to 10 silver Croeseids of 10.8 grams. Croesus (reigned c.560–c.546 BC), king of Lydia, who became associated with great wealth. Croesus is credited with issuing the Croeseid, the first true gold coins with a standardised purity for general circulation, Herodotus mentioned the innovation made by the Lydians: Achaemenid coinage Achaemenid bimetallic equivalence: 1 gold Daric was equivalent in value to 20 silver Sigloi. Under the Achaemenids the exchange rate in weight between gold and silver was 1 to 13. Many ancient bimetallic systems would follow, starting with Achaemenid coinage. From around 515 BCE under Darius I, the minting of Croesids in Sardis was replaced by the minting of Darics and Sigloi. The earliest gold coin of the Achaemenid Empire, the Daric, followed the weight standard of the Croeseid, and is therefore considered to be later and derived from the Croeseid. The weight of the Daric would then be modified through a metrological reform, probably under Darius I. Sardis remained the central mint for the Persian Darics and Sigloi of Achaemenid coinage, and there is no evidence of other mints for the new Achaemenid coins during the whole time of the Achaemenid Empire. Although the gold Daric became an international currency which was found throughout the Ancient world, the circulation of the Sigloi remained very much limited to Asia Minor: important hoards of Sigloi are only found in these areas, and finds of Sigloi beyond are always very limited and marginal compared to Greek coins, even in Achaemenid territories. Argentina In 1881, a currency reform in Argentina introduced a bimetallic standard, which went into effect in July 1883. Units of gold and silver pesos would be exchanged with paper peso notes at given par values, and fixed exchange rates against key international currencies would thus be established. Unlike many metallic standards, the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed, and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. This convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the Argentine government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could do to prevent it. France A French law of 1803 granted anyone who brought gold or silver to its mint the right to have it coined at a nominal charge in addition to the official rates of 200 francs per kilogram of 90% silver, or 3100 francs per kilogram of 90% fine gold.Dickson Leavens, Silver Money, Chapter IV Bimetallism in France and the Latin Monetary Union, page 25 This effectively established a bimetallic standard at the rate which had been used for French coinage since 1785, i.e. a relative valuation of gold to silver of 15.5 to 1. In 1803 this ratio was close to the market rate, but for most of the next half century the market rate was above 15.5 to 1. As a consequence, silver powered the French economy and gold was exported. Then the Forty-Niners went to California and the resulting supply of gold reduced its value relative to silver. The market rate fell below 15.5 to 1, and remained below until 1866. Frenchmen responded by exporting silver to India and importing nearly two-fifths of the world's production of gold in the period from 1848 to 1870.Dickson Leavens, op. cit. page 26 Napoleon III introduced five franc gold coins which provided a substitute for the silver five franc coins which were hoarded,John Porteous, Coins in History, page 238 but still maintained the formal bimetallism implicit in the 1803 law. Latin Monetary Union The national coinages introduced in Belgium (1832), Switzerland (1850), and Italy (1861) were based on France's bimetallic currency. These countries joined France in a treaty signed on 23 December 1865 which established the Latin Monetary Union (LMU). Greece joined the LMU in 1868 and about twenty other countries adhered to its standards.Robert Friedberg, Gold Coins of the World, fourth edition, page 11 The LMU effectively adopted bimetallism by allowing unlimited free coinage of gold and silver at the 15.5 to 1 rate used in France, but also began to back away from bimetallism by allowing limited issues of low denomination silver coins struck to a lower standard for government accounts.John Porteous, op. cit. page 241 A surplus of silver led the LMU to limit free coinage of silver in 1874 and to end it in 1878, effectively abandoning bimetallism for the gold standard. United Kingdom Medieval and early modern England used both gold and silver, at fixed rates, to provide the necessary range of coin denominations; but silver coinage began to be restricted in the 18th century, first informally, and then by an Act of Parliament in 1774.A. Redish, Bimetallism (2006) p. 67 and p. 205 After the suspension of metal convertibility from 1797 to 1819, Peel's Bill set the country on the gold standard for the remainder of the century; however advocates of a return to bimetallism did not cease to appear. After the crash of 1825, William Huskisson argued strongly within the Government for bimetallism, as a way to increase credit (as well as to ease trade with South America).B. Hilton, A Mad, Bad & Dangerous People? (Oxford, 2008) p. 303 Similarly, after the banking crisis of 1847, Alexander Baring headed an external bimetallist movement hoping to prevent the undue restriction of the currency.É. Halévy, Victorian Years (London: Ernest Benn, 1961) p. 201 It was, however, only in the last quarter of the century that the movement for bimetallism gathered real strength, drawing on Manchester cotton merchants and City financiers with Far East interests to offer a serious (if ultimately unsuccessful) challenge to the gold standard.P. J.

Then in 1792, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton proposed fixing the silver to gold exchange rate at 15:1, as well as establishing the mint for the public services of free coinage and currency regulation \\"in order not to abridge the quantity of circulating medium.\\".2 Annals of Cong. 2115 (1789–1791), cited in Arthur Nussbaum, The Law of the Dollar, Columbia Law Review, Vol. 37, No. 7 (Nov., 1937), pp. 1057–1091 With its acceptance, Sec.11 of the Coinage Act of 1792 established: \\"That the proportional value of gold to silver in all coins which shall by law be current as money within the United States, shall be as fifteen to one, according to quantity in weight, of pure gold or pure silver;\\" the proportion had slipped by 1834 to sixteen to one. Silver took a further hit with the Coinage Act of 1853, when nearly all silver coin denominations were debased, effectively turning silver coinage into a fiduciary currency based on its face value rather than its weighted value. Bimetallism was effectively abandoned by the Coinage Act of 1873, but not formally outlawed as legal currency until the early 20th century. The merits of the system were the subject of debate in the late 19th century. If the market forces of supply and demand for either metal caused its bullion value to exceed its nominal currency value, it tends to disappear from circulation by hoarding or melting down. Political debate In the United States, bimetallism became a center of political conflict toward the end of the 19th century. During the Civil War, to finance the war the U.S. switched from bimetallism to a fiat money currency. After the war, in 1873, the government passed the Fourth Coinage Act and soon resumption of specie payments began (without the free and unlimited coinage of silver, thus putting the U.S. on a mono-metallic gold standard.) Farmers, debtors, Westerners and others who felt they had benefited from wartime paper money formed the short-lived Greenback Party to press for cheap paper money backed by silver.R. B. Nye, the Growth of the United States (Penguin 1955) p. 599-603 The latter element – \\"free silver\\" – came increasingly to the fore as the answer to the same interest groups' concerns, and was taken up as a central plank by the Populist movement.H. G, Nicholas, The American Union (Penguin 1950) p. 220 Proponents of monetary silver, known as the silverites, referred back to the Fourth Coinage Act as \\"The Crime of '73,\\" as it was judged to have inhibited inflation, and favored creditors over debtors. Some reformers, however, like Henry Demarest Lloyd, saw bimetallism as a red herring and feared that free silver was \\"the cowbird of the reform movement, likely to push the other eggs out of the nest.Quoted in R. B. Nye, the Growth of the United States (Penguin 1955) p. 603 Nevertheless the Panic of 1893, a severe nationwide depression, brought the money issue strongly to the fore again. The \\"silverites\\" argued that using silver would inflate the money supply and mean more cash for everyone, which they equated with prosperity. The gold advocates said silver would permanently depress the economy, but that sound money produced by a gold standard would restore prosperity. 1896 Republican poster warns against free silver. Bimetallism and \\"Free Silver\\" were demanded by William Jennings Bryan who took over leadership of the Democratic Party in 1896, as well as by the Populists, and a faction of Republicans from silver mining regions in the West known as the Silver Republicans who also endorsed Bryan.R. B. Nye, the Growth of the United States (Penguin 1955) p. 603 The Republican Party itself nominated William McKinley on a platform supporting the gold standard which was favored by financial interests on the East Coast. Bryan, the eloquent champion of the cause, gave the famous \\"Cross of Gold\\" speech at the National Democratic Convention on July 9, 1896, asserting that \\"The gold standard has slain tens of thousands.\\" He referred to \\"a struggle between 'the idle holders of idle capital’ and 'the struggling masses, who produce the wealth and pay the taxes of the country;’ and, my friends, the question we are to decide is: Upon which side will the Democratic party fight?\\" At the peroration, he said: \\"You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\\" R. B. Nye, the Growth of the United States (Penguin 1955) p. 604 However, his presidential campaign was ultimately unsuccessful; this can be partially attributed to the discovery of the cyanide process by which gold could be extracted from low-grade ore. This process and the discoveries of large gold deposits in South Africa (Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1887 - with large-scale production starting in 1898) and the Klondike Gold Rush (1896) increased the world gold supply and the subsequent increase in money supply that free coinage of silver was supposed to bring. The McKinley campaign was effective at persuading voters in the business East that poor economic progress and unemployment would be exacerbated by the adoption of the Bryan platform.H. G, Nicholas, The American Union (Penguin 1950) p. 222 1896 saw the election of McKinley. The direct link to gold was abandoned in 1934 in Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program and later the link was broken by Richard Nixon when he closed the gold window. Economic analysis In 1992, economist Milton Friedman concluded that abandonment of the bimetallic standard in 1873 led to greater price instability than would have occurred otherwise, and thus resulted in long-term harm to the US economy. His retrospective analysis led him to write that the act of 1873 \\"... was a mistake that had highly adverse consequences.\\"Milton Friedman, Money Mischief (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1992) 78.

LAUREL AND HARDY: THE MAGIC BEHIND THE MOVIES. Bonaventure Press. p.608. (January 14, 1892 – November 2, 1992) was an American film and television producer, director, actor and studio executive, who was the founder of the namesake Hal Roach Studio, who was active in the industry from the 1910s to the 1990s. He is remembered today for producing a number of successes including the Laurel and Hardy franchise, the films of entertainer Charley Chase, and the Our Gang short film comedy series. Early life and career Hal Roach was born in Elmira, New York, to Charles Henry Roach, whose father was born in Wicklow, County Wicklow, Ireland, and Mabel Gertrude Bally, her father John Bally being from Switzerland.Skretvedt, Randy (2016). LAUREL AND HARDY: THE MAGIC BEHIND THE MOVIES. Bonaventure Press. p.608 A presentation by the great American humorist Mark Twain impressed Roach as a young grade school student. After an adventurous youth that took him to Alaska, Hal Roach arrived in Hollywood, California, in 1912 and began working as an extra in silent films. Upon coming into an inheritance, he began producing short film comedies in 1915 with his friend Harold Lloyd, who portrayed a character known as Lonesome Luke. In September 1916, Roach married actress Marguerite Nichols. They had two children, Hal Jr. (June 15, 1918 – March 29, 1972), who followed his father as a producer and director, and Margaret M. Roach (March 15, 1921 – November 22, 1964), who worked as an actress in the 1930s and 1940s. Marguerite died in March 1941. Roach married a second time on September 1, 1942, to Lucille Prin (January 20, 1913 – April 4, 1981), a Los Angeles secretary. They were married at the on-base home of Colonel Franklin C. Wolfe and his wife at Wright- Patterson Airfield in Dayton, Ohio, where Roach was stationed at the time while serving as a major in the United States Army Air Corps. Roach and Lucille had four children, Elizabeth Carson Roach (December 26, 1945 – September 5, 1946), Maria May Roach (born April 14, 1947), Jeanne Alice Roach (born October 7, 1949), and Kathleen Bridget Roach (born January 29, 1951). Success as a comedy producer The Hal Roach Studios (1919–1963) in 1959 Unable to expand his studios in Downtown Los Angeles because of zoning, Roach purchased what became the Hal Roach Studios from Harry Culver in Culver City, California. During the 1920s and 1930s, he employed Lloyd (his top money-maker until his departure in 1923), Will Rogers, Max Davidson, the Our Gang children, Charley Chase, Harry Langdon, Thelma Todd, ZaSu Pitts, Lupe Vélez, Patsy Kelly and, most famously, Laurel and Hardy. During the 1920s, Roach's biggest rival was producer Mack Sennett. In 1925, Roach hired away Sennett's supervising director, F. Richard Jones. Roach released his films through Pathé Exchange until 1927, when he struck a distribution deal with Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. He converted his silent movie studio to sound in late 1928 and began releasing talking shorts in early 1929. In the days before dubbing, foreign language versions of the Roach comedies were created by reshooting each film in the Spanish, French, and occasionally Italian and German languages. Laurel & Hardy, Charley Chase, and the Our Gang children (some of whom had barely begun school) were required to recite the foreign dialogue phonetically, often working from blackboards hidden off camera. In 1931, with the release of the Laurel & Hardy film Pardon Us, Roach began producing occasional full-length features alongside the short subjects. Short films became less profitable and were generally phased out by 1936, save for the Our Gang series. An Our Gang feature film General Spanky did not do as well as expected; Roach continued making the shorts for MGM. In 1937, Roach conceived a joint business venture partnering with Vittorio Mussolini, son of fascist Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, to form a production company called \\"R.A.M\\" (Roach and Mussolini). Roach claimed the scheme involved Italian bankers (not the government) providing US$6 million that would enable Roach's studio to produce a series of 12 films. Eight would be for Italian screening only whilst the remaining four would receive world distribution. The first film for Italy was to be a feature film of the opera Rigoletto. Graham, Sheila Hollywood Today Hal Roach Defends Mussolini Deal p. 4 The Milwaukee Journal 5 October 1937 This proposed business alliance with Mussolini alarmed MGM which intervened and forced Roach to buy his way out of the venture. This embarrassment, coupled with the underperformance of much of Roach's latest feature films (save for Laurel & Hardy titles and the odd non-L&H; hit such as 1937's Topper), led to the end of Roach's distribution contract with MGM. In May 1938, Roach sold MGM the production rights and actors contracts to the Our Gang shorts. Roach signed a distribution deal with United Artists at this time.Ward, Richard Lewis (2005). A History of Hal Roach Studios. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press. Pg. 97–102, 116, 225. . From 1937 to 1940, Roach concentrated on producing glossy features, abandoning low comedy almost completely. Most of his new films were either sophisticated farces (like Topper, 1937, and The Housekeeper's Daughter, 1939) or rugged action fare (like Captain Fury, 1939, and One Million B.C., 1940). Roach's one venture into heavy drama was the acclaimed Of Mice and Men (1939), in which actors Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney Jr. played the leading roles. The Laurel and Hardy comedies, once the Roach studio's biggest drawing cards, were now the studio's least important product and were phased out altogether in 1940. In 1940, Roach experimented with medium-length featurettes, running 40 to 50 minutes each. He contended that these \\"streamliners\\", as he called them, would be useful in double- feature situations where the main attraction was a longer-length epic. Exhibitors agreed with him and used Roach's mini-features to balance top-heavy double bills. United Artists continued to release Roach's streamliners through 1943. By this time, Roach no longer had a resident company of comedy stars and cast his films with familiar featured players (William Tracy and Joe Sawyer, Johnny Downs, Jean Porter, Frank Faylen, William Bendix, George E. Stone, etc.). World War II and television Hal Roach, Sr., commissioned in the US Army Signal Reserve Corps in 1927 p. 125 Ward, Richard Lewis A History of the Hal Roach Studios SIU Press, 15 Aug 2006 was called back to active military duty in the Signal Corps in June 1942, at age 50. The studio output he oversaw in uniform was converted from entertainment featurettes to military training films. The studios were leased to the U.S. Army Air Forces, and the First Motion Picture Unit made 400 training, morale and propaganda films at \\"Fort Roach\\". Members of the unit included Ronald W. Reagan and Alan Ladd. After the war the government returned the studio to Roach, with millions of dollars of improvements. In 1946, Hal Roach resumed motion picture production, with former Harold Lloyd co-star Bebe Daniels as an associate producer. Roach was the first Hollywood producer to go to an all-color production schedule, making four streamliners in Cinecolor, although the increased production costs did not result in increased revenue. In 1948, with his studio deeply in debt, Roach re-established his studio for television production, with Hal Roach Jr., producing series such as The Stu Erwin Show, Steve Donovan, Western Marshal, Racket Squad, The Public Defender, The Gale Storm Show, Rocky Jones, Space Ranger and My Little Margie, and independent producers leasing the facilities for such programs as Amos 'n' Andy, The Life of Riley and The Abbott and Costello Show. By 1951, the studio was producing 1,500 hours of television programs a year, nearly three times Hollywood's annual output of feature movies.\\"Hollywood Is Humming\\", Time, October 29, 1951. Recognizing the value of his film library, in 1943 Roach began licensing revivals of his sound-era productions for theatrical and home-movie distribution. Roach's films were also early arrivals on television. His Laurel and Hardy comedies were successful in television syndication, as were the Our Gang comedies produced from 1927-1938, for which in 1949 Roach had bought back the rights from MGM and re-branded for television as \\"The Little Rascals\\". He thus became one of the first significant film producers to venture into television. Notably not one of his former child stars was ever paid a cent in residuals from the substantial profits netted. Later years In 1955, Roach sold his interests in the production company to his son, Hal Roach Jr., and retired from active production. The younger Roach lacked much of his father's business acumen and soon lost the studio to creditors. It was finally shut down in 1961. For two more decades, Roach Sr. occasionally worked as a consultant on projects related to his past work. Extremely vigorous into an advanced age, Roach contemplated a comedy comeback at 96. In 1984, 92-year-old Roach was presented with an honorary Academy Award. Former Our Gang members Jackie Cooper and George \\"Spanky\\" McFarland made the presentation to a flattered Roach, with McFarland thanking the producer for hiring him 53 years prior. An additional Our Gang member, Ernie Morrison, was amongst the crowd and started the standing ovation for Hal Roach. Cooper's gratitude towards Roach was especially notable. Years earlier Cooper had been the youngest Academy Award nominee ever for his performance in Skippy when he had been under contract with Roach. Although Paramount had paid Roach $25,000 for Cooper's services in that film, Roach paid Cooper only his standard salary of $50 per week. On 21 January 1992, Roach was a guest on The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson, one week after his 100th birthday, where he recounted experiences with such stars as Stan Laurel and Jean Harlow; he even did a brief, energetic demonstration of a hula dance. In February 1992, Roach travelled to Berlin to receive the honorary award of the Berlinale Kamera for Lifetime Achievement at the 42nd Berlin International Film Festival. On March 30, 1992, Roach appeared at the 64th Academy Awards ceremony, hosted by Billy Crystal. When Roach rose from the audience for a standing ovation, he decided to give a speech without a microphone, causing Crystal to quip \\"I think that's appropriate because Mr. Roach started in silent films.\\" Death Hal Roach died in his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, from pneumonia, on November 2, 1992, just two months before his 101st birthday. He had married twice, and had six children, eight grandchildren, and a number of great-grandchildren. Roach outlived three of his children by more than 20 years: Hal Jr. (died in 1972), Margaret (died in 1964), and Elizabeth (died in 1946). He also outlived many of the children who starred in his films. Roach is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Elmira, New York, where he grew up.A History of the Hal Roach Studios Hal Roach Studios The 14.5 acre (58,680 m²) studio once known as \\"The Lot of Fun\\", containing 55 buildings, was demolished in 1963 (despite tentative plans to reopen the facilities as \\"Landmark Studios\\"), after one last movie, Dime with a Halo (1963), with Barbara Luna, was made there in 1963 by Boris Sagal (to Sagal, the forlorn facility looked like a run-down Mexican city). They were replaced by light industrial buildings, businesses, and an automobile dealership. Today, Culver City's \\"Landmark Street\\" runs down what was the middle of the old studio lot, with the two original sound stages having been located on the north side of Landmark Street, and the backlot/city street sets had been located at the eastern end of Landmark Street. A plaque sits in a small park across from the studio's location, placed there by The Sons of the Desert.Culver City History: Hal Roach Studios , culvercity.org. Retrieved August 23, 2008 Most of the film library was bought in 1971 by a Canadian company that adopted the \\"Hal Roach Studios\\" name. It primarily handled the business of keeping the library in the public eye and licensing products based upon the classic film series. In 1983, Hal Roach Studios became one of the first studios to venture into the controversial business of film colorization. Buying a fifty percent interest in Wilson Markle's Colorization Inc, it began creating digitally colored versions of several Laurel and Hardy features, the Frank Capra film It's a Wonderful Life (1946), Night of the Living Dead (1968), and other popular films. In the 1980s, Hal Roach Studios produced Kids Incorporated in association with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Roach's old distributor in the 1930s. During the 1980s, Hal Roach Studios distributed its classic film library, as well as films in the public domain, on home video. 1986 saw the merger of Hal Roach Studios with the production firm of Robert Halmi into Qintex Entertainment, named after Australian investor Qintex. Under this name, Qintex collaborated with Universal Television to distribute The New Leave It To Beaver in syndication and the Canadian drama T. and T., starring Mr. T, with Canadian animation house Nelvana. However, Qintex's Australian parent ended up collapsing under a crushing debtload, forcing Qintex Entertainment into bankruptcy. In the years that followed, the Roach company changed hands several more times. Independent television producer Robert Halmi (who had merged his company with Roach) bought the company in the early 1990s after the bankruptcy of Qintex, and it became RHI Entertainment. A short time later, this successor company was acquired by Hallmark Entertainment in 1994, but Halmi, Robert Halmi Jr. and affiliates of Kelso & Company reacquired the company in 2006. Hallmark Entertainment was absorbed into RHI Entertainment (with Vivendi as the current home video output partner). In that same decade, a new incarnation of Hal Roach Studios (operated by the Roach Trust) was established, and today this new version of the company has released classic films on DVD, many of which are from Roach's own archival prints of his films, while others are public domain titles mastered from the best available 35 mm elements.

It is the second-largest town and municipality in Ibiza; an island described by Time Out magazine as \\"arguably the clubbing capital of the universe\\".World's best clubbing destinations The town is situated on Sant Antoni Bay on the west coast of the island, part of the Spain autonomous community of the Balearic Islands. History For two thousand years, Sant Antoni was a small fishing village that rose from the Roman natural harbor Portus Magnus, but it began to grow in the late 1950s when many hotels and tourist resorts were built as part of a mass tourism initiative which took place across Spain. As the number of tourists grew, the development of bars, hotels and other tourist infrastructure spread right around to the other side of San Antonio bay, as far as Cala de Bou which lies in the adjacent municipality of Sant Josep de sa Talaia. Since the 1980s British tourists have made up the majority of summertime visitors to San Antonio. The Egg The Egg in the port of Sant Antoni The Egg is the best known landmark in Sant Antoni, located in the centre of the main roundabout at the entrance to the town. The Egg is a statue erected in the early 1990s to commemorate the local claim of having been the birthplace of Christopher Columbus (there is a similar claim that Hannibal was born in the region). The statue is in the shape of an egg, containing at its centre a model of his ship: the Santa Maria. The choice of an egg comes from a story about Columbus, who when seeking funding for his Western route to the Indies, was told it was impossible. He then allegedly asked if standing an egg upright was impossible, and when told that it was, he cracked the base of an egg, thus making it possible for it to stand upright. He was then granted funding. See Egg of Columbus. Passeig de ses Fonts Passeig de ses Fonts Part of Sant Antoni's harbourside promenade, Passeig de ses Fonts, is an area which was developed in the early 1990s to improve the appearance of the town. There are many plants, including palm trees and rubber plants, as well as large fountains, which are illuminated by night. Across the square are a host of restaurants and cafés offering a view over Sant Antoni Bay. It is also the best place from which to watch the massive fireworks display which celebrates the fiesta of Saint Bartholomew on 24 August. West End The 'West End' is an area of San Antonio. Only a couple of streets wide; the main street is the Carrer de Santa Agnès, it hosts a variety of bars ranging from the dance and house music Ibiza is famed for to rock and indie music. PR staff line the street trying to attract tourists into any of the many bars on the strip with special deals on alcohol. It is also the location of the Island's only strip & lap dancing club: Taboo. Bars on the street open as early as 10am for breakfasts and continue to steadily open throughout the day for sports or afternoon entertainment until everything is open by 11pm and then everything closes again at 3am. Originally the name \\"The West End\\" refers to a night time minibus trip from hotels in Es Cana in the 1970s that would come to San Antonio's bars (as Es Cana had no bar scene) and the name of this tour package was \\"The West End Experience\\". Since then the area has become known simply as \\"The West End\\". Sunset Strip Along the coast of the natural bay of San Antonio de Portmany in the west is the Sunset Strip - a venue where visitors to the island meet at sunset at various bars including the Cafe del Mar, Café Mambo, where the likes of Swedish House Mafia, Carl Cox, David Guetta and Pete Tong DJ on a regular basis. The west-facing strip of coastline means that it faces the sunset. Mint Lounge Bar, Café Savannah, Fresh Ibiza and Café del Mar are situated here. Café Del Mar is one of the iconic Ibiza venues that has played an integral part in the evolution of the island over the last four decades. Ferries and boat cruises Among the harbour of San Antonio there are various boats and ferries that have multiple connections to beaches such as Cala Bassa, Cala Compte, Pinet Playa, Es Puet, Cala Grasió, Cala Salada and Port es Torrent. These have daily departures from may until end September or October. Also once a week there is a ferry to Formentera.  Nightclubs  Sant Antoni is home to two of the main Ibiza nightclubs, Es Paradis, established in 1975, and Eden which was renamed from Kaos in 1999 and renovated in 2013. thumb  Gallery  File:San Antonio Harbour Cruise.jpgNemo leaving harbour File:Capitan nemo cream.jpgSan Antonio harbour File:Queue at san an harbour.jpgQueue at San Antonio harbour File:San an Harbour.jpgSan Antonio harbour File:Cala Salada, near Sant Antoni.jpgCala Salada, north of Sant Antoni File:Sunset of ibiza from san an.JPGSunset File:West End Sant Antoni.jpgWest End of Sant Antoni in July 2006.

In 1979, she recorded with Silva and Sheila Horne on \\"Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy\\". McGruder changed her professional name to Satori Shakoor in mid-1980s and became a comedian and sketch actress on the Canadian show Thick and Thin. Early life and career McGruder was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1954, and began singing and studying the violin as a child. Taught by her stepmother, she sang in her junior high choir and joined a female trio called New Dawn, which performed at nightclubs and one Black Panthers rally. She became a professional violinist aged 15 as well as playing in her high school orchestra at Cass Technical High School. While still at school, Jeanette also played in various orchestras and bands in and around the city of Detroit, including The Electrifying Strings, a jazz string group with Earl Klugh (guitar), Cecil \\"Van\\" Cephus (keyboards), and Ralph Armstrong (bass). She played in studio sessions on recordings for local Detroit artists, and earned money for occasional performances at United Sound Studios for Motown Records. Education and later musical career In 1972, upon entering the music department of Michigan State University (MSU), McGruder opted against pursuing a career as a violinist, and instead majored in voice. In 1974, she performed \\"We Shall Overcome\\" at an event honoring Coretta Scott King. In 1978, after four years of studying at MSU and two years of singing in local bands, McGruder moved to New York City and began auditioning for Broadway. Later that year, her friend Overton Loyd told her about an audition for the Brides of Funkenstein, a new group created by George Clinton. McGruder returned to Detroit and got a job as a backing singer for Parliament- Funkadelic, and the original Brides of Funkenstein, Dawn Silva and Lynn Mabry, whose album Funk the Walk (1978) was in the charts. Mabry left the group within a year, leaving Dawn Silva to record a second album alone. George Clinton brought McGruder and Sheila Horne into the foreground, and the Brides of Funkenstein became a three-piece group, recording their second album, Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy (1979), which was voted into Billboards \\"Top 50 albums\\" of all time in 2002. One single from the album, \\"Didn't Mean To Fall in Love\\", won a rhythm and blues award in 1981 for \\"Best New Female Group\\". The Brides of Funkenstein disbanded in 1981. McGruder became the lyricist and lead singer for a Detroit rock band called Cherubim, which recorded one album and played in Japan. A dramatic and humorous monologue featuring McGruder, now known as Satori Shakoor, was released on The Moth on January 21, 2013. Personal life In 1982, McGruder had a son, Noah Shakoor. In 2002, Noah and his wife, Fonda Hollowell, had a daughter.

History Previously background singers for Sly Stone, Mabry and Silva joined the P-Funk collective in the mid-1970s. George Clinton named the group (based on a storyline and characters from the Parliament album The Clones of Dr. Funkenstein). The Brides provided the vocals for the 1977 album Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs by P-Funk guitarist Eddie Hazel. Clinton produced the Brides' debut album, Funk Or Walk, for Atlantic Records in 1978. The album was a success, selling over three hundred thousand copies within the first week as well as winning a Record World award for best new female group. The album charted at #7 on the R&B; charts; the single \\"Disco To Go\\" was certified gold in America and reached platinum status in Europe and Asia. The duo became an opening act for Parliament-Funkadelic tours and also performed backing vocals for the ensemble itself. Lynn Mabry left the group in 1979. Dawn Silva lead singer invited back-up \\"Bridesmaids\\" Sheila Horne and Jeanette McGruder to sing on the second Brides album, Never Buy Texas From A Cowboy. This lineup received a Cashbox Rhythm & Blues award for best new female artist, beating out The Pointer Sisters, Sister Sledge, and Cheryl Lynn. The Brides' second album was rated in 2001 by Rolling Stone as one of the top 50 coolest albums ever released. The trio recorded a third album, Shadows On The Wall, Shaped Like The Hat You Wore in 1980, but the album was not released. Most of the songs from the unreleased album gradually appeared elsewhere in the P-Funk catalog. Lynn Mabry resurfaced in 1984 as a backing vocalist with Talking Heads, appearing in the concert film Stop Making Sense along with P-Funk colleague Bernie Worrell. Silva and Mabry had a brief reunion in 1981 as the New Wave Brides, opening for Grace Jones, and a lengthy tour with Was (Not Was). Silva would tour and record with the Gap Band from 1983 to 1991, moving on to work with Ice Cube. In 2000 Silva released the solo album All My Funky Friends, which received rave reviews in Europe and Asia. Dawn Silva & The Brides continue to tour.

He served as a head coach in the National Basketball Association (NBA), most notably with the Boston Celtics. He was also the head coach of the Washington Capitols and Tri- Cities Blackhawks. As a coach, Auerbach set NBA records with 938 wins and nine championships. After his coaching retirement in 1966, he served as president and front office executive of the Celtics until his death. As general manager and team president of the Celtics, he won an additional seven NBA titles for a grand total of 16 in a span of 29 years and making him one of the most successful team officials in the history of North American professional sports. Auerbach is remembered as a pioneer of modern basketball, redefining basketball as a game dominated by team play and defense and for introducing the fast break as a potent offensive weapon. He groomed many players who went on to be inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. Additionally, Auerbach was vital in breaking down color barriers in the NBA. He made history by drafting the first African-American NBA player, Chuck Cooper in 1950, introduced the first African-American starting five in 1964, and hired Bill Russell as the first African-American head coach in North American sports in 1966.http://newsone.com/2003287/bill-russell-first-black-coach-in-pro-sports/ Famous for his polarizing nature, he was well known for smoking a cigar when he thought a victory was assured, a habit that became, for many, \\"the ultimate symbol of victory\\" during his Boston tenure. In 1967, the NBA Coach of the Year award, which he had won in 1965, was named the \\"Red Auerbach Trophy\\", and Auerbach was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1969. In 1970, Auerbach was named President of the Boston Celtics, and first held the presidency from 1970-1997. In 2001, after having spent 4 years as the team's vice-chairman, he returned to the role of team president and served in that capacity until his death in 2006. In 1980, he was named the greatest coach in the history of the NBA by the Professional Basketball Writers Association of America, and was NBA Executive of the Year in 1980. In addition, Auerbach was voted one of the NBA 10 Greatest Coaches in history, was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame, and is honored with a retired number 2 jersey in the TD Garden, the home of the Boston Celtics. Early life Arnold Jacob Auerbach was one of the four children of Marie and Hyman Auerbach. Hyman was a Russian-Jewish immigrant from Minsk, Russia, and Marie Auerbach, née Thompson, was American-born. Auerbach Sr. had left Russia when he was 13, and the couple owned a delicatessen store and later went into the dry-cleaning business. Auerbach spent his whole childhood in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, playing basketball. With his flaming red hair and fiery temper, Auerbach was soon nicknamed \\"Red.\\" Amid the Great Depression, Auerbach played basketball as a guard at PS 122 and in the Eastern District High School, where he was named \\"Second Team All-Brooklyn\\" by the World-Telegram in his senior year. After a season at Seth Low Junior College, Auerbach received an athletic scholarship to the basketball program of Bill Reinhart at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Auerbach was a standout basketball player and graduated with a M.A. in 1941. In those years, Auerbach began to understand the importance of the fast break, appreciating how potent three charging attackers against two back-pedalling defenders could be. First coaching years (1940–1950) In 1940, Auerbach began coaching basketball at the St. Albans School and Roosevelt High School in Washington, D.C. Three years later, he joined the US Navy for three years, coaching the Navy basketball team in Norfolk. There, he caught the eye of Washington millionaire Mike Uline, who hired him to coach the Washington Capitols in the newly founded Basketball Association of America (BAA), a predecessor of the NBA. In the 1946–47 BAA season, Auerbach led a fast break-oriented team built around early BAA star Bones McKinney and various ex-Navy players to a 49–11 win–loss record, including a standard- setting 17-game winning streak that stood as the single-season league record until 1969. In the playoffs, however, they were defeated by the Chicago Stags in six games.https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/1947-baa- semifinals-stags-vs-capitols.html The next year the Capitols went 28–20 but were eliminated from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker. In the 1948–49 BAA season, the Caps won their first 15 games and finished the season at 38–22. The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the Minneapolis Lakers, who were led by Hall-of-Fame center George Mikan. In the next season, the BAA and the rival league National Basketball League merged to become the NBA, and Auerbach felt he had to rebuild his squad. However, owner Uline declined his proposals, and Auerbach resigned. After leaving the Capitols, Auerbach became assistant coach of the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team. It was assumed that Auerbach would take over for head coach Gerry Gerard, who was battling cancer. During his tenure at Duke, Auerbach regularly worked with future All-American Dick Groat. Auerbach later wrote that he \\"felt pretty bad waiting for [Gerard] to die\\" and that it was \\"no way to get a job\\". Auerbach left Duke after a few months when Ben Kerner, owner of the Tri-Cities Blackhawks, gave him the green light to rebuild the team from scratch. Auerbach traded more than two dozen players in just six weeks, and the revamped Blackhawks improved, but ended the 1949–50 NBA season with a losing record of 28–29. When Kerner traded Auerbach's favorite player John Mahnken, an angry Auerbach resigned again. Also in 1950, Auerbach took a position as the athletic director of Kutsher's Hotel in the Catskills, NY. Kutsher's was the center of a summertime basketball league, and players from the New York City area would participate, playing for one of several local country clubs and hotels. Boston Celtics (1950–2006) The early years (1950–56) Prior to the 1950–51 NBA season, Walter Brown, owner of the Boston Celtics, was desperate to turn around his struggling and financially strapped franchise, which was reeling from a 22–46 record. Brown, in characteristic candor, said to a gathering of local Boston sportswriters, \\"Boys, I don't know anything about basketball. Who would you recommend I hire as coach?\\" The group vociferously answered that he get the recently available Auerbach, and Brown complied. In the 1950 NBA draft, Auerbach made some notable moves. First, he famously snubbed Hall-of-Fame New England point guard Bob Cousy in the 1950 NBA draft, infuriating the Boston crowd. He argued that the flashy Cousy lacked the poise necessary to make his team, taunting him as a \\"local yokel\\". Second, he drafted African-American Chuck Cooper, the first black player to be drafted by an NBA club. With that, Auerbach effectively broke down the color barrier in professional basketball. In that year, the core of the Celtics consisted of Hall-of-Fame center Ed Macauley, Auerbach's old favorite McKinney, and an unlikely addition, Cousy. Cousy had refused to report to the club that had drafted him (which happened to be the Blackhawks, Auerbach's old club), and because his next team (the Chicago Stags) folded, he ended up with the Celtics. With Auerbach's fast-break tactics, the Celtics achieved a 39–30 record but lost in the 1951 NBA Playoffs to the New York Knicks. However, the relationship between Auerbach and Cousy improved when the coach saw that the \\"Houdini of the Hardwood\\"—as the spectacular dribbler and flashy passer Cousy was lovingly called—became the first great playmaker of the fledgling NBA. In the following 1951–52 NBA season, Auerbach made a remarkable draft pick of future Hall-of-Fame guard Bill Sharman. With the high-scoring Macauley, elite passer Cousy, and new prodigy Sharman, Auerbach had a core that provided high-octane fast-break basketball. Other notable players who joined the Celtics were forwards Frank Ramsey and Jim Loscutoff. In the next years until 1956, the Celtics would make the playoffs every year, but never won the title. In fact, the Celtics often choked in the playoffs, going a mere 10–17 in the postseason from 1951 through 1956. As Cousy put it: \\"We would get tired in the end and could not get the ball.\\" As a result, Auerbach sought a defensive big man who could both get easy rebounds, initiate fast breaks, and close out games. The dynasty (1956–66) Auerbach sitting on the bench next to rookie Bill Russell during a game at Boston Garden, December 26, 1956. Bob Cousy can be seen in the background. Before the 1956 NBA draft, Auerbach had already set his sights on defensive rebounding center Bill Russell. Via a draft-day trade that sent Macauley and rookie Cliff Hagan to the rival St. Louis Hawks (Kerner had moved the Blackhawks to St. Louis), he acquired a center in Russell, who would go on to become one of the greatest basketball players of all time. In the same draft, Auerbach picked up forward Tom Heinsohn and guard K.C. Jones, also two future Hall-of-Famers. Emphasizing team play rather than individual performances, and stressing that defense was more important than offense, Auerbach drilled his players to play tough defense and force opposing turnovers for easy fast-break points. Forward Tom Sanders recalled that the teams were also regularly among the best-conditioned and toughest squads. Anchored by defensive stalwart Russell, the tough Celtics forced their opponents to take low-percentage shots from farther distances (there was no three-point arc at the time); misses were then often grabbed by perennial rebounding champion Russell, who then either passed it on to elite fast-break distributor Cousy or made the outlet pass himself, providing their sprinting colleagues opportunities for an easy slam dunk or layup. Auerbach also emphasized the need for role players like Frank Ramsey and John Havlicek, who became two of the first legitimate sixth men in NBA history, a role later played by Don Nelson. Auerbach's recipe proved devastating to the opposition. From 1957 to 1966, the Celtics won nine of ten NBA championships. This included eight consecutive championships—which is the longest championship streak in North American sports—and six victories over the Los Angeles Lakers of Hall-of-Famers Elgin Baylor and Jerry West in the NBA Finals. The streak also denied perennial scoring and rebounding champion Wilt Chamberlain a title during Auerbach's coaching reign. Flowing from Auerbach's emphasis on teamwork, what was also striking about his teams was that they never seemed to have a dominant scorer: in the 1960–61 NBA season, for instance, the Celtics had six players who scored between 15 and 21 points per game, but none made the Top 10 scoring list. In 1964, he sent out the first-ever NBA starting five consisting of an African-American quintet, namely Russell, Willie Naulls, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, and K. C. Jones. Auerbach would go a step further in the 1966–67 NBA season, when he stepped down after winning nine titles in 11 years, and made Bill Russell player-coach. Auerbach also popularized smoking a victory cigar whenever he thought a game was already decided, a habit that became cult-like in popularity in the Boston area. Furthermore, having acquired a reputation as a fierce competitor, he often got into verbal altercations with officials, receiving more fines and getting ejected more often than any other coach in NBA history. Bill Russell next to head coach Red Auerbach after winning the 1966 NBA Finals. All in all, Auerbach directly coached nine NBA championship teams and mentored four players—Russell, Sharman, Heinsohn, and K.C. Jones—who would go on to win an additional seven NBA championships as coaches (two each for Russell, Heinsohn and Jones, all with the Celtics, and one for Sharman with the Lakers). Ten players who played for Auerbach have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame—Macauley, Ramsey, Cousy, Sharman, Heinsohn, Russell, K. C. Jones, Havlicek, Sam Jones and Bailey Howell. Although Don Nelson played for Auerbach only during his last year as coach, his influence was profound: Nelson would later join Auerbach as one of the 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history. Sharman and Heinsohn would become two of only four people to be inducted into the Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. Few if any coaches can match Auerbach's record of wins and successful mentorship of his players. General manager (1966–84) Prior to the 1965–66 NBA season, Auerbach announced the coming year would be his last as coach, stating to the rest of the league, \\"This is your chance to take your last shot at me.\\" After losing game 1 of the 1966 finals to the Lakers, he publicly named his successor, center Bill Russell. The Celtics won the series in seven games, sending Auerbach out on top. Russell then took over as a player-coach, and so became the first African- American head coach ever in the four major North American professional team sports. While his pupil led the Celtics to two further titles in 1968 and 1969, Auerbach rebuilt the aging Celtics with shrewd draft picks, among them future Hall-of-Famers Dave Cowens and Jo Jo White, as well as Paul Westphal and Don Chaney. With his ex-player Tom Heinsohn coaching the Celtics and led by former sixth man John Havlicek, Auerbach's new recruits won the Atlantic Division every year from 1972 to 1976, winning the NBA title in 1974 and 1976. Auerbach also signed veteran forward/center Paul Silas and ex-ABA star Charles Scott. However, Auerbach could not prevent the Celtics from going into a slump at the end of the 1970s. He traded away both Silas and Westphal because they wanted salary increases that would have made them higher earners than the best player on the Celtics (Cowens), which was not acceptable to Auerbach. While the Westphal trade to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Charlie Scott was considered a success due to the Celtics' 13th title in 1976, Auerbach later admitted he erred in letting Silas go, even after Cowens personally begged him to give Silas a new deal. When Havlicek retired in 1978, the Celtics went 61–103 in two seasons. In the summer of 1978, after the worst in a string of contentious clashes with several different owners after Walter Brown's passing in 1964, Auerbach hopped into a taxi to take him to Logan Airport, where he was to board a flight to New York to consider a lucrative contract offer from Knicks owner Sonny Werblin. However, the cab driver pleaded with him to stay, emphasizing how much Bostonians loved him and considered him family.https://www.si.com/vault/1969/12/31/8230694/the-road-not-taken Soon after, heading a team press conference, and with his typical bravado, Auerbach puffed on his trademark cigar and stated simply, \\"I'm not going anywhere. We're going to sign Larry Bird, and we're going to be on top again.\\" Despite knowing that Bird, a talented young player from unheralded Indiana State, had a year of college eligibility remaining, he had drafted Bird as a junior eligible in the 1978 NBA draft and waited for a year until the future Hall-of- Fame forward Bird arrived, finally setting aside his team salary rules when it became clear that his choices were paying Bird a record-setting rookie salary or watch him simply re-enter the 1979 draft. Bird then became the highest-paid Celtic as a rookie, with a $650,000-per year deal. Auerbach knew that the brilliant, hardworking Bird would be the cornerstone of a new Celtics generation. In 1980, Auerbach achieved another great coup, which was dubbed \\"The Steal of The Century\\". He convinced the Golden State Warriors to trade him a #3 overall pick and future Hall-of-Fame center Robert Parish in exchange for two picks in the 1980 NBA draft: #1 overall Joe Barry Carroll and the #13 pick Rickey Brown. With the #3 pick, Auerbach selected the player he most wanted in the draft, Kevin McHale, who would also be inducted into the Hall of Fame. The frontcourt of Parish-McHale-Bird became one of the greatest front lines in NBA history. Auerbach hired head coach Bill Fitch who led the revamped Celtics to the 1981 title. In 1983, Auerbach named former Celtics player K.C. Jones coach of the Celtics. Starting in 1984, Jones coached the Celtics to four straight appearances in the NBA Finals, winning championships in 1984 and 1986. Auerbach as a part-time side gig was the color analyst on NBA and college basketball games for TBS sports from 1982-87.https://www.sun- sentinel.com/news/fl- xpm-1988-05-16-8801300317-story.htmlhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1982/12/13/turners- dream-game-was-a-rude-awakening/d6e09a7c-4534-48a2-9bff-663cb52a93b3/ President and vice chairman (1984–2006) In 1984, after he relinquished his general managing duties to Jan Volk, Auerbach focused on continuing as president and later vice-chairman of the Boston Celtics. In a surprising move after winning their 15th title, he traded popular guard Gerald Henderson, the game 2 hero in the finals against the Lakers, for Seattle's first round draft pick in 1986. Two years later, after the Celtics defeated Houston in the finals for their 16th championship, he used the second overall pick in the 1986 draft, the pick acquired from Seattle, to take college prodigy Len Bias from Maryland, arguably the most brilliant coup in Auerbach's stellar career. With the team's star players still in their prime, the defending champions appeared set to compete at the top for years. However, tragedy struck just two days later, when Bias died of a cocaine overdose. Several years later, Celtics star player Reggie Lewis died suddenly in 1993, and without any league compensation for either loss, the team fell into decline, not seeing another Finals in Auerbach's lifetime. In an interview, Auerbach confessed that he lost interest in big-time managing in the early 1990s, preferring to stay in the background and concentrating on his pastimes, racquetball and his beloved cigar-smoking. He would, however, stay on with the Celtics as president until 1997, as vice chairman until 2001, and then became president again, a position he held until his death, although in his final years, he was weakened by heart problems and often used a wheelchair. Personal life Auerbach being honored on October 25, 2006, a few days before his death, for his service in the Navy during World War II. Auerbach was one of four children of American-born Marie Auerbach and Russian Jewish immigrant Hyman Auerbach in Brooklyn. His brother Zang Auerbach, four years his junior, was a respected cartoonist and portraitist at the Washington Star. He married Dorothy Lewis in the spring of 1941. The couple had two daughters, Nancy and Randy.They also helped raise Nancy’s daughter Julie. Auerbach was known for his love for cigar smoking. Because Auerbach made his victory cigars a cult in the 1960s, Boston restaurants would often say \\"no cigar or pipe smoking, except for Red Auerbach\\". In addition, Auerbach was well known for his love of Chinese food. In an interview shortly before his death, he explained that since the 1950s, Chinese takeout was the most convenient nutrition: back then, NBA teams travelled on regular flights and had a tight time schedule, so filling up the stomach with heavier non-Chinese food meant wasting time and risking travel- sickness. Over the years, Auerbach became so fond of this food that he even became a part-owner of a Chinese restaurant in Boston. Despite a heart operation, he remained active in his 80s, playing racquetball and making frequent public appearances. Despite his fierce nature, Auerbach was popular among his players. He recalled that on his 75th birthday party, 45 of his former players showed up; and when he turned 80, his perennial 1960s victim Wilt Chamberlain showed up, a gesture which Auerbach dearly appreciated. In an interview with ESPN, Auerbach stated that his all-star fantasy team would consist of Bill Russell—who in the former's opinion was the ultimate player to start a franchise with—as well as Bob Pettit, Elgin Baylor, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West, with John Havlicek as the sixth man. Regarding greatest basketballers of all time, Auerbach's candidates were Russell, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Michael Jordan.\\" Death Auerbach died of a heart attack on October 28, 2006 at the age of 89. NBA commissioner David Stern said, \\"the void caused by his death will never be filled\\" and players Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, John Havlicek and Larry Bird, as well as contemporaries like Jerry West, Pat Riley, and Wayne Embry universally hailed Auerbach as one of the greatest personalities in NBA history. Bird stated \\"Red shared our passion for the game, our commitment to excellence, and our desire to do whatever it takes to win.\\" Auerbach was survived by his daughters, Nancy, Randy, Julie, and Julie’s children Peter, Hope, and Noelle. Auerbach was interred in Falls Church, Virginia at King David Memorial Gardens within National Memorial Park on October 31, 2006. Attendees included basketball dignitaries Bill Russell, Kevin McHale, Danny Ainge, and David Stern. During the 2006–07 NBA season, NBA TV and NBA.com aired reruns of Auerbach's four- minute instructional videos known as \\"Red on Roundball\\" previously aired during NBA on CBS halftime shows in the 1970s and 1980s, and as a testament to his importance in the Boston sports world, the Boston Red Sox honored Auerbach at their April 20, 2007 game against the New York Yankees by wearing green uniforms and by hanging replicated Celtics championship banners on the \\"Green Monster\\" at Fenway Park. Boston won 7–6. Prior to Boston's season opener against the Wizards, his signature was officially placed on the parquet floor near center court, thereby naming the court as \\"Red Auerbach Parquet Floor.\\" The ceremony was attended by his daughter Randy and some of the Celtics legends. The signature replaced the Red Auerbach memorial logo used during the 2007 season. Red Auerbach Memorial worn by the Celtics for the 2006–07 NBA season. Writing Auerbach was the author of seven books. His first, Basketball for the Player, the Fan and Coach, has been translated into seven languages and is the best-selling basketball book in print. His second book, co-authored with Paul Sann, was Winning the Hard Way. He also wrote a pair of books with Joe Fitzgerald: Red Auerbach: An Autobiography and Red Auerbach On and Off the Court. In October 1991 M.B.A.: Management by Auerbach was co- authored with Ken Dooley. In 1994, Seeing Red was written with Dan Shaughnessy. In October 2004, his last book, Let Me Tell You a Story, was co- authored with sports journalist John Feinstein. Legacy Among Auerbach's accomplishments during his 20-year professional coaching career were eleven Eastern Division titles (including nine in a row from 1957–65), 11 appearances in the finals (including ten in a row from 1957–66), and nine NBA championships. With a total of 16 NBA championship rings in a span of 29 years (1957–86) as the Celtics coach, general manager, and team president, Auerbach is the most successful team official in NBA history. He is credited with creating several generations of championship Boston Celtics teams, including the first Celtics dynasty with Bill Russell, which won an NBA record eight titles in a row (1959–66). As Celtics general manager, he created championship-winning teams around Hall-of-Famers Dave Cowens in the 1970s and Larry Bird in the 1980s. In addition to coaching, Auerbach was a highly effective mentor; several players coached by Auerbach would become successful coaches themselves. Bill Russell won two titles as Auerbach's successor, Tom Heinsohn won a pair of championships as a Celtics coach in the 1970s, K.C. Jones led the Celtics to two further titles in the 1980s, and Bill Sharman coached the Los Angeles Lakers to their first title in 1972. In addition, prototypical sixth man Don Nelson had a highly successful coaching career and joined his mentor Auerbach as one of 10 Greatest Coaches in NBA history. Throughout his coaching tenure in Boston, Auerbach served several other roles including, but not limited to, general manager, head of scouting, personnel director and travel agent. In the early offseasons, he would take the Celtics on barnstorming tours around New England, promoting the still fledgling NBA. At the end of every season, regardless of their on-court success, he would approach owner Brown and ask, \\"Walter, are our last paychecks going to clear?\\" to which Brown would always positively respond, and they would. Despite Brown's own close association with the NHL's Boston Bruins, whose owners also possessed the Boston Garden, the Celtics were fleeced on concessions and profits as tenants. During this era, when most team owners not only thought of, but also treated their players as cattle and/or slaves, athletes from all the four major professional sports leagues were fighting for their rights and economic fairness. As Auerbach represented management of the Celtics, team members frustrated with their salaries had only him to complain to, or about, in their role in the formation of the players' union. These interpersonal dynamics are construed as follows by journalist David Halberstam:Halberstam. pg. 343 Pertaining to the above, Walter Brown was not rich; also that as Auerbach was as tough at the negotiating table as he was on the practice court and in the locker room, it was always for the purpose of getting the most out of his players. In the summer of 1984, with much trepidation, Auerbach reluctantly signed former finals MVP Cedric Maxwell to a lucrative guaranteed contract to stay with the Celtics. Then, Auerbach's worst fears came true when Maxwell arrived that fall out of shape, and, suffering from various injuries, provided little contribution as the team lost a playoff for the first time ever to the Lakers in the 1985 Finals. Two subsequent facts are perhaps most relevant in evaluating Auerbach's legacy: First, he was able to trade Maxwell to San Diego in exchange for former MVP Bill Walton, who was a major contributor to the team winning its 16th title in 1986, the last of Auerbach's career. Second, Maxwell continues to be embraced as a beloved member of the Celtics family, including having his number retired alongside the team's legendary greats. In Auerbach's honor, the Celtics have retired a number-2 jersey with the name \\"AUERBACH\\", memorializing his role as the second most important Celtic ever, behind founder Walter Brown, in whose honor the number-1 \\"BROWN\\" jersey is retired. In 1985, the Boston Celtics retired the #2 jersey with Auerbach's name. His story is documented in The First Basket, the first and most comprehensive documentary on the history of Jews and Basketball. He is also featured as an interview subject for the film. Coaching pioneer From his early days, Auerbach was convinced that the fast break, where a team used a quick outlet pass to fast guards who run downcourt and score before the opponent had re-established position, was a potent tactical weapon. This new strategy proved lethal for the opposition. Further, Auerbach moved emphasis away from individual accolades and instilled the teamwork element into his players. He also invented the concept of the role player and of the sixth man,Creator of the Sixth Man Talks About Game's Best stating: \\"Individual honors are nice, but no Celtic has ever gone out of his way to achieve them. We have never had the league's top scorer. In fact, we won seven league championships without placing even one among the league's top 10 scorers. Our pride was never rooted in statistics.\\" While Auerbach was not known for his tactical bandwidth, famously restricting his teams to just seven plays, he was well known for his psychological warfare, often provoking opposing players and officials with unabashed trash talk. For his fiery temper, he was ejected more often and received more fines than any other coach in NBA history. Age did nothing to diminish his fire; in 1983, after star Larry Bird was ejected from a preseason game against Philadelphia at the Garden along with the Sixers' role player Marc Iavaroni, Auerbach stormed onto the court and after taking the officials to task, screamed nose-to-nose with the 6'10\\" 260-pound Moses Malone. Concerning his own team, Auerbach was softer. Earl Lloyd, the first black player to play in the NBA, said: \\"Red Auerbach convinced his players that he loved them [...] so all they wanted to do was please him.\\" No color barrier Auerbach was known for choosing players for talent and motivation, with disregard for skin color or ethnicity. In 1950, he made NBA history by drafting the league's first African-American player, Chuck Cooper. He constantly added new black players to his squad, including Bill Russell, Tom Sanders, Sam Jones, K.C. Jones, and Willie Naulls. In 1964, these five players became the first African-American starting five in the NBA. When Auerbach gave up coaching to become the Celtics general manager in 1966, he appointed Bill Russell as his successor. Russell became the first black NBA coach, and was the first black coach of a professional sports organization since Fritz Pollard in 1925. Similarly, in the 1980s, as the Celtics GM, Auerbach fielded an earnest, hardworking team that was derided as being \\"too white.\\" While the 1980s Celts were, in actuality, neither predominantly white nor black, the NBA at the time was predominately black. White players like Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Danny Ainge, and Bill Walton played alongside Tiny Archibald, Dennis Johnson, Robert Parish, and Cedric Maxwell to bring three more championships in the '80s under coaches Bill Fitch (white) and K.C. Jones (black). Arnold \\"Red\\" Auerbach Award To honor Auerbach, the Celtics created the Arnold \\"Red\\" Auerbach award in 2006. It is an award given annually to the current Celtic player or coach who \\"best exemplifies the spirit and meaning of a true Celtic.\\" NBA Coach of the Year Award The NBA gives out an annual coach of the year award to honor the league's best coach as voted by a panel of sportswriters. The trophy is named the 'Red Auerbach trophy'The Jewish Coaches Association also presents an identically named \\"Red Auerbach Trophy,\\" to the most outstanding Jewish- American basketball coach of the year. and has a figure of Auerbach sitting on a bench.

It is now a tourist town with a population of 66,800 residents (as of 2015). The Aksumite Empire was a naval and trading power that ruled the region from about 400 BCE into the 10th century. In 1980, UNESCO added Axum's archaeological sites to its list of World Heritage Sites due to their historic value. Axum is located in the Maekelay Zone of the Tigray Region, near the base of the Adwa mountains. It has an elevation of and is surrounded by La'ilay Maychew district. History The Aksumite Empire and other polities in 565 Axum was the centre of the marine trading power known as the Aksumite Empire, which predated the earliest mentions in Roman-era writings. Around 356 CE, its ruler was converted to Christianity by Frumentius. Later, under the reign of the Emperor Kaleb, Axum was a quasi-ally of Byzantium against the Sasanian Empire which had adopted Zoroastrianism. The historical record is unclear, with ancient church records the primary contemporary sources. It is believed it began a long and slow decline after the seventh century due partly to the Persians and then the Arabs contesting old Red Sea trade routes. Eventually Aksum was cut off from its principal markets in Alexandria, Byzantium and Southern Europe and its trade share was captured by Arab traders of the era. The Aksumite Empire was finally destroyed by Empress Gudit, and eventually some of the people of Aksum were forced south and their old way of life declined. As the empire's power declined so did the influence of the city, which is believed to have lost population in the decline, similar to Rome and other cities thrust away from the flow of world events. The last known (nominal) emperor to reign was crowned in about the 10th century, but the empire's influence and power ended long before that. Its decline in population and trade then contributed to the shift of the power center of the Ethiopian Empire south to the Agaw region as it moved further inland. The city of Axum was the administrative seat of an empire spanning one million square miles. Eventually, the alternative name (Ethiopia) was adopted by the central region, and subsequently, the present modern state.G.

Wachtebeke (Belgium): University Press: 165-178.Smidt W (2003) Cartography, in: Uhlig S (ed.): Encyclopaedia Aethiopica, Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, vol. 1: 688-691 The Aksumite Empire and the Ethiopian Church Dome and Belltower of the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion 14th century illustration showing the Christian ruler (Negus) of Aksum (Atse Armah, also known as Al-Najashi) declining the request of a pagan Meccan delegation, to forfeit the first Muslims who received refuge in the city of Axum following the First Hijra as Prophet Muhammad told them to take refuge in Axum. The Aksumite Empire had its own written language, Ge'ez, and developed a distinctive architecture exemplified by giant obelisks, the oldest of which (though much smaller) date from 5000–2000 BCE.Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 871. The empire was at its height under Emperor Ezana, baptized as Abreha, in the 4th century (which was also when it officially embraced Christianity).Fage, J. D., A History of Africa (London: Routledge, 2001), pp. 53–4. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church claims that the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion in Axum houses the Biblical Ark of the Covenant, in which lie the Tablets of Stone upon which the Ten Commandments are inscribed.Hodd, Mike, Footprint East Africa Handbook (New York: Footprint Travel Guides, 2002), p. 859. . Ethiopian traditions suggest that it was from Axum that Makeda, the Queen of Sheba, journeyed to visit King Solomon in Jerusalem and that the two had a son, Menelik, who grew up in Ethiopia but traveled to Jerusalem as a young man to visit his father's homeland. He lived several years in Jerusalem before returning to his country with the Ark of the Covenant. According to the Ethiopian Church and Ethiopian tradition, the Ark still exists in Axum. This same church was the site where Ethiopian emperors were crowned for centuries until the reign of Fasilides, then again beginning with Yohannes IV until the end of the empire. Axum is considered to be the holiest city in Ethiopia and is an important destination of pilgrimages.See Linda Kay Davidson and David Gitlitz Pilgrimage, from the Ganges to Graceland: an Encyclopedia (Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO, 2002), 17–18. Significant religious festivals are the Timkat festival (known as Epiphany in western Christianity) on 19 January (20 January in leap years) and the Festival of Maryam Zion on November 24. The Obelisk of Axum after being returned to Ethiopia. In 1937, a 24-metre (79-foot) tall, 1,700-year-old Obelisk of Axum, was broken into five parts by the Italians and shipped to Rome to be erected. The obelisk is widely regarded as one of the finest examples of engineering from the height of the Axumite empire. Despite a 1947 United Nations agreement that the obelisk would be shipped back, Italy balked, resulting in a long-standing diplomatic dispute with the Ethiopian government, which views the obelisk as a symbol of national identity. In April 2005, Italy finally returned the obelisk pieces to Axum amidst much official and public rejoicing; Italy also covered the $4 million costs of the transfer. UNESCO assumed responsibility for the re-installation of this stele in Axum, and by the end of July 2008 the obelisk had been reinstalled (see panographic photos in external links below). It was unveiled on 4 September 2008. Axum and Islam The Aksumite Empire had a longstanding relationship with Islam. According to ibn Hisham,ibn Hisham, The Life of the Prophet when Muhammad faced oppression from the Quraysh clan, he sent a small group that included his daughter Ruqayya and her husband Uthman to Axum. Sahama, the Aksumite monarch, gave them refuge and protection. He refused the requests of the Quraish clan to send these refugees back to Arabia. These refugees did not return until the sixth Hijri year (628), and even then many remained in Ethiopia, eventually settling at Negash in what is now the Mibraqawi Zone. There are different traditions concerning the effect these early Muslims had on the ruler of Axum. The Muslim tradition is that the ruler of Axum was so impressed by these refugees that he became a secret convert.Ibn Ishaq, The Life of Muhammad (Oxford, 1955), 657–58. On the other hand, Arabic historians and Ethiopian tradition state that some of the Muslim refugees who lived in Ethiopia during this time converted to Orthodox Christianity. There is also a second Ethiopian tradition that, on the death of Ashama ibn Abjar, Muhammed is reported to have prayed for the king's soul, and told his followers, \\"Leave the Abyssinians in peace, as long as they do not take the offensive.\\"Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), pp. 42f Main sights The King Ezana's Stela, in Axum, Ethiopia The major Aksumite monuments in the town are steles. These obelisks are around 1,700 years old and have become a symbol of the Ethiopian people's identity. The largest number are in the Northern Stelae Park, ranging up to the 33-metre-long (3.84 metres wide, 2.35 metres deep, weighing 520 tonnes) Great Stele, believed to have fallen and broken during construction. The Obelisk of Axum (24.6 metres high, 2.32 metres wide, 1.36 metres deep, weighing 170 tonnes) was removed by the Italian army in 1937, and returned to Ethiopia in 2005 and reinstalled July 31, 2008. The next tallest is the 24-metre (20.6 metres high above the front baseplate, 2.65 metres wide, 1.18 metres deep, weighing 160 tonnes) King Ezana's Stela. Three more stelae measure 18.2 metres high, 1.56 metres wide, 0.76 metres deep, weighing 56 tonnes; 15.8 metres high, 2.35 metres wide, one metre deep, weighing 75 tonnes; 15.3 metres high, 1.47 metres wide, 0.78 metres deep, weighing 43 tonnes.Scarre, Chris Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World 1999 The stelae are believed to mark graves and would have had cast metal discs affixed to their sides, which are also carved with architectural designs. The Gudit Stelae to the west of town, unlike the northern area, are interspersed with mostly 4th century tombs. The Chapel of the Tablet The other major feature of the town are the old and new Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion. The Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion was built in 1665 by Emperor Fasilides and said to have previously housed the Ark of the Covenant. The original cathedral, said to have been built by Ezana and augmented several times after was believed to have been massive with 12 naves. It was burned to the ground by Gudit, rebuilt, and then destroyed again during the Abyssinian–Adal war of the 1500s. It was again rebuilt by Emperor Gelawdewos (completed by his brother and successor Emperor Minas) and Emperor Fasilides replaced that structure with the present one. Only men are permitted entry into the Old St. Mary's Cathedral (some say as a result of the destruction of the original church by Gudit). The New Cathedral of St. Mary of Zion stands next to the old one, and was built to fulfill a pledge by Emperor Haile Selassie to Our Lady of Zion for the liberation of Ethiopia from the Fascist occupation. Built in a neo- Byzantine style, work on the new cathedral began in 1955, and allows admittance to women. Emperor Haile Selassie interrupted the state visit of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II to travel to Axum to attend the dedication of the new Cathedral and pay personal homage, showing the importance of this church in the Ethiopian Empire. The Queen visited the Cathedral a few days later. Between the two cathedrals is a small chapel known as The Chapel of the Tablet built at the same time as the new cathedral, and which is believed to house the Ark of the Covenant. Emperor Haile Selassie's consort, Empress Menen Asfaw, paid for its construction from her private funds. Admittance to the chapel is closed to all but the guardian monk who resides there. Entrance is even forbidden to the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church, and to the Emperor of Ethiopia during the monarchy. The two cathedrals and the chapel of the Ark are the focus of pilgrimage and considered the holiest sites in Ethiopia to members of its Orthodox Church. Other attractions in Axum include archaeological and ethnographic museums, the Ezana Stone written in Sabaean, Ge'ez and Ancient Greek in a similar manner to the Rosetta Stone, King Bazen's Tomb (a megalith considered to be one of the earliest structures), the so- called Queen of Sheba's Bath (actually a reservoir), the 4th-century Ta'akha Maryam and 6th-century Dungur palaces, Pentalewon Monastery and Abba Liqanos and the Lioness of Gobedra rock art Local legend claims the Queen of Sheba lived in the town. Earlier Researches In February 1893, the British explorers Theodore Bent and Mabel Bent travelled by boat to Massawa on the Red Sea west coast and made their way overland to excavate at Aksum and Yeha, in the hope of researching possible links between early trading networks and cultures on both sides of the Red Sea.Bent published the trip in his: The sacred city of the Ethiopians: being a record of travel and research in Abyssinia in 1893, London, Longmans, Green and Co, 1894. They reached Aksum by 24 February 1893,The Travel Chronicles of Mrs J. Theodore Bent, Vol. 2, 2012, Oxford, Archaeopress, page 201. but their work was curtailed‘Theodore Bent’s expedition to Abyssinia for the purpose of investigating the ruins of Aksum has not been so successful as might have been wished, owing to the hostilities which are being carried on between two of the chiefs; indeed, he and Mrs. Bent had a narrow escape from being involved in their hostilities. Still the expedition has not been altogether without interesting results.’ (Mountstuart E. Grant Duff, The Annual Address on the Progress of Geography, 1892-93, The Geographical Journal, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Jul., 1893), 21).by the tensions between the Italian occupiers and local warlords, continuing ramifications of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, and they had to make a hasty retreat by the end of March to Zula for passage back to England.Bent published three further accounts relating to their Ethiopian trip of 1893: From the Heart of Abyssinia, Illustrated London News, 8 April 1893; In the North of Abyssinia, Illustrated London News, 6 May 1893; The Ancient Trade Route across Ethiopia, The Geographical Journal, Vol. 2 (2) (Aug), 140-6. Climate Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as subtropical highland (Cwb). Demographics According to Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia (CSA), as of July 2012 (est.) the town of Axum's population was 56,576.

Education The Axum University was established in Axum in May 2006 on a greenfield site, four kilometers (2.45 miles) from the town center; the inauguration ceremony was held on 16 February 2007. The current area of the campus is 107 hectares, with ample room for expansion. The establishment of a university in Axum is expected to contribute much to the ongoing development of the country in general and of the region in particular.  3D Documentation with Laser- Scanning  The Zamani Project, document cultural heritage sites in 3D to create a record for future generations.

He has been one of Hong Kong's most commercially successful film actors since the mid-1980s, performing in more than 160 films while maintaining a successful singing career at the same time. In the 1990s, Lau was branded by the media as one of the Four Heavenly Kings of Cantopop and was named as \\"Fourth Tiger\\" among the Five Tiger Generals of TVB during the 1980s Lau was entered into the Guinness World Records for the \\"Most Awards Won by a Cantopop Male Artist\\". By April 2000, he had already won an unprecedented total of 292 awards. Lau also holds numerous film acting awards, having won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor three times and the Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actor twice. In 2005, Lau received the \\"No.1 Box office Actor 1985–2005\\" award of Hong Kong, yielding a box office total of HK$1,733,275,816 for shooting 108 films in the past 20 years, and in 2007, he received the \\"Nielsen Box Office Star of Asia\\" award by the Nielsen Company (ACNielsen). On 25 June 2018, Lau was invited to be a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Early life Andy Lau was born in Tai Po, Hong Kong, a son of a fireman Lau Lai (劉禮). He was the fourth child of the family; he has three elder sisters, one younger sister, and a younger brother named Lau Tak- sing. His family was considered to be wealthy as his grandfather was a landowner, but his father left with him to the slums of Diamond Hill when he was six, where the area was full of wooden houses, and was burnt down when he was eleven. As a young boy, Lau had to fetch water for his family up to eight times a day because their house was not equipped with plumbing. He graduated from a Band One secondary school, Ho Lap College in San Po Kong, Kowloon. He was named as Lau Fook-wing (劉福榮) during his academic years. He also practices Chinese calligraphy. Lau converted to Buddhism in the 1980s. He was raised in a nominally Buddhist household and is now a follower of the Lingyan Mountain Temple in Taiwan. Career Actor In 1981, Lau signed up for the artist training program offered by TVB, which is where his acting career began. The lead role which led to his initial popularity was in the 1982 TVB series The Emissary. In 1983, Lau's role as \\"Yang Guo\\" in the TVB wuxia series, The Return of the Condor Heroes (神鵰俠侶) further increased his popularity. From then on, he would take on many of the lead roles in many TVB series. In September 1983, TVB was looking to increase their ratings in competition with Korea and Japan for the best variety show. The station then created the show TVB All- star challenge (星光熠熠勁爭輝) featuring almost the entire line-up of the most popular actors and singers at the time..\\" 第二章 影視新星 無線電視臺的五虎將. Korea referred as Goryeo (高麗). Retrieved on 31 January 2010. Lau, along with Tony Leung, Michael Miu, Felix Wong, and Kent Tong were branded as the \\"Five Tiger Generals of TVB\\" (無線五虎將) due to their popularity on the show. In the late '80s, Lau left TVB due to contract problems. TVB wanted to bind him to an exclusive five-year contract which Lau refused to sign, so TVB blacklisted him. He then focused on his film career. Avenue of Stars in Hong Kong In 1981, Lau made a guest appearance in one of Susanna Kwan's music videos and caught the eye of the manager Teddy Robin. Teddy Robin then gave Lau a chance to play a small role in the film, Once Upon a Rainbow. This was the first step in Lau's film acting career. He landed a role in Ann Hui's 1982 film, Boat People. Later in 1983 he had his first leading role in the Shaw Brothers- produced action film, On the Wrong Track. One of his early leading roles included the more serious 1988 film, The Truth (法內情). However, Lau is best known in films for his (often) recurring roles as a \\"Heroic Gangster\\", such as Wong Kar-wai's 1988 film As Tears Go By, and Benny Chan's 1990 film A Moment of Romance. Though a respectable actor, Lau was initially known more for his handsome features. Some people he has worked with have called him a matinee idol, but he has claimed to be an artist. Lau has proved his acting skills in many of his films. His first major acting prize came with A Fighter's Blues, which was his first Golden Bauhinia Award for Best Actor.Dianying.com. \\"Dianying.com.\\" 第 6 屆金紫荊獎頒獎. Retrieved on 31 January 2010. He would win the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Actor award that year for Running Out of Time. In 2004, he won the prestigious Golden Horse Award for Best Leading Actor for his performance in Infernal Affairs III, the second sequel to the popular Infernal Affairs. He is also known to Western audiences for starring in wuxia films such as House of Flying Daggers, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography. In 2005, Lau received the \\"No.1 Box office Actor 1985–2005\\" award of Hong Kong, yielding a box office total of HKD 1,733,275,816 for shooting 108 films in the past 20 years. The aforementioned figure is as compared to the first runner-up Stephen Chow's (HKD 1,317,452,311) and second runner-up Jackie Chan's (HKD 894,090,962). \\"I've never imagined that it would be as much as 1.7 billion!\\" he told reporters. For his contributions, a wax figure of Lau was unveiled on 1 June 2005 at the Madame Tussauds Hong Kong. In 2007, Lau also received the \\"Nielsen Box Office Star of Asia\\" award by the Nielsen Company (ACNielsen). Film producer In 1991, Lau set up his own film production company, Teamwork Motion Pictures, which in 2002 was renamed to Focus Group Holdings Limited. His contributions in the film industry as well as his involvement in nurturing new talent in the Asian film industry led him to winning the \\"Asian Filmmaker of the Year\\" award in the Pusan International Film Festival in 2006. Some of the films Lau has produced include award-winning films, Made in Hong Kong and A Simple Life, his 100th film, A Fighter's Blues, the Chinese digital film Crazy Stone, and big budget action blockbusters, Firestorm and Shock Wave. Musical career Andy Lau in concert 2011 Lau released his first album \\"Only Know that I Still Love You\\" (只知道此刻愛你) under Capital Artists in 1985. This album was not a big hit, but despite having a voice not traditionally associated with popular music, Lau's hard work and perseverance resulted in him becoming one of the most successful singers in Cantopop. His singing career reached stellar status in 1990 with the release of the album entitled \\"Would It Be Possible\\" (可不可以), and his subsequent releases only solidified his status as a marketable singer. For that song, he would win his first 1990 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards. He would then win at least one RTHK award category every year consecutively until the year 2007. From Jade Solid Gold Top 10 Awards he has won the \\"Most Popular Hong Kong Male Artist\\" award 7 times and the \\"Asia Pacific Most Popular Hong Kong Male Artist\\" award 15 times. He was also entered into the Guinness World Records for \\"Most Awards Won by a Cantopop Male Artist\\". By April 2000, he had already won an unprecedented total of 292 awards. Many of Lau's songs quickly topped the music charts not only in Hong Kong, but also in Taiwan, Mainland China, and in many different parts of Asia. Some of his most notable hits include \\"The Days We Spent Together\\" (一起走過的日子), \\"If You Are My Legend\\" (如果你是我的傳說), \\"The Tide\\" (潮水), \\"Forget Love Potion\\" (忘情水), \\"True Forever\\" (真永遠), \\"Chinese people\\" (中國人), \\"Love You Forever\\" (愛你一萬年), \\"You Are My Woman\\" (你是我的女人), and \\"Secret Admiration\\" (暗裡著迷). Besides singing in Cantonese and Mandarin, he has also sung in other languages such as English, Japanese, Malay, and Taiwanese Hokkien. One example of a Hokkien song was (世界第一等), and he has also performed a Cantonese cover of Joan Jett's \\"I Hate Myself for Loving You\\" (我恨我痴心). Since the early 1990s, Lau, along with Jacky Cheung, Aaron Kwok, and Leon Lai have been referred to by the Chinese media as the Cantopop Four Heavenly Kings. Lau sang alongside Jackie Chan during a part of the 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony on 24 August 2008. In addition, Lau, who has been supporting disabled athletes in Hong Kong for more than a decade, was appointed as the Goodwill ambassador for the 2008 Summer Paralympics. He led other performers in singing and performing the song \\"Everyone is No.1\\" at the Beijing National Stadium just a few hours before the 2008 Paralympics opening ceremony began. He also sang the theme song \\"Flying with the Dream\\" with Han Hong during the Paralympics opening ceremony on 6 September 2008. As a songwriter, most of Lau's creative works are as a lyricist. To date, Lau has composed five songs, which include \\"Missing You Everyday\\" (天天想你), co-composed with Eric Moo, \\"If One Day\\" (如果有一天), \\"Happiness Is So Far... So Sweet\\" (幸福.這麼遠.那麼甜), \\"Spending the Rest Our Lives Together\\" (餘生一起過), all of which he also sang and wrote the lyrics, and \\"Brothers\\" (兄弟), the theme song of his 2004 film, Jiang Hu, which he wrote the lyrics for but was sung by co-star Chapman To. Most of the songs he has written have been for himself. Books written To date, Lau has written and published two books. They include his 1995 autobiography, This Is How I Grew Up (我是這樣長大的) written in prose, and his 2012 book, My 30 Work Days (我的30個工作天), which is a collection of his 30 personal diaries he wrote while working on the 2011 film, A Simple Life. Appearance in other media Lau is alleged to have been featured as a non- player character (NPC) as a random pedestrian in a sandbox-style action video game called Prototype. On 6 July, the Hong Kong local newspapers Headline Daily and Sing Tao Daily reported on Lau's cameo. Community service In 1994, Lau established the Andy Lau Charity Foundation which helps people in need and promotes a wide range of youth education services. In 1999, he received the Ten Outstanding Young Persons of the World award, being the third person from Hong Kong at that time to receive this distinguished honour. In 2008, Lau took a main role in putting together the Artistes 512 Fund Raising Campaign for relief toward the victims of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. It was one of the largest and most ambitious charity events ever assembled in the territory. Lau was noted for his active involvement in charity works throughout his 30 years in showbiz and honoured as a \\"Justice of Peace\\" by the Hong Kong SAR government in 2008. In May 2010, he received the \\"World Outstanding Chinese\\" award and an \\"honorary doctorate\\" from the University of New Brunswick, Canada.\\"Ta Kung Pao.\\" Retrieved on 6 May 2010. On 14 December 2017, Lau was awarded a Doctor of Letters degree from the Hong Kong Shue Yan University, with the citation highlighting his popularity among locals which stated: \\"His low-key, modest, friendly and approachable personality has endeared him to millions of fans and ordinary folks alike, who also consider him to be a 'heartthrob' and the 'unofficial Chief Executive of Hong Kong\\". Lau was also named in the Panama Papers leak. Personal life In 2008, Lau married Malaysian Chinese Carol Chu () after 24 years of speculation over their relationship, both are vegetarian and devout Buddhists. The couple married in Las Vegas. On 9 May 2012, Chu gave birth to their first child, a daughter, Hanna. In January 2017, Lau was seriously injured after being thrown off and stomped by a horse during a commercial shoot in Khao Lak, an area three hours outside of Thailand's capital city, Bangkok. However, Lau was able to make a full return to work in August 2017, stating he has recovered 95 per cent from his injuries and has fully recovered by the end of the year.

Bush is the youngest son of former U.S. President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush and the brother of former U.S. President George W. Bush; former Florida Governor Jeb Bush; the late Pauline Robinson Bush; Neil Bush; and Dorothy Bush Koch. Biography Early life Bush (center) with his family in 1966 Marvin Pierce Bush was born on October 22, 1956, in Midland, Texas, and was named after his maternal grandfather, Marvin Pierce. He attended Woodberry Forest School in Virginia, graduating in 1975. He went on to obtain a B.A. degree in English from the University of Virginia, where he became a member of the Delta Phi fraternity (St. Elmo Hall). He spent most summers and holidays at the Bush family estate. Career He worked as director of HCC Insurance Holdings. HCC, formerly Houston Casualty Company, is a publicly traded insurance company on the New York Stock Exchange. He appears in the 2008 award-winning documentary on Lee Atwater, Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story. He served on the board of directors for SECURACOM from 1993 to June 2000. Personal life He is married to Margaret Conway (née Molster) (b. March 2, 1959). They have two children: a daughter, Marshall Lloyd (b. May 14, 1984), and a son, Charles Walker (b. December 12, 1989). Politics In the 2016 presidential election, Marvin Bush endorsed Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, over either Republican candidate Donald Trump or Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He stated that Johnson and running mate Bill Weld were both two-term governors,Marvin Bush endorses Gary Johnson While appearing on 106.7 The Fan's program The Junkies, Bush said: \\"... nobody knows about them, people think it is sort of a wasted vote—but, both Gary Johnson and Bill Weld were each successful two-term governors who balanced their budgets.\\" who are \\"fiscally conservative, and their essential message is 'get bureaucracy off our backs', which used to be a part of what the Republicans believed.\\"Washington Times: Marvin Bush voting for Gary Johnson \\"That's why I'm voting Libertarian. A hundred percent … both Gary Johnson and Bill Weld were each successful two-term governors who balanced their budgets, so they're fiscally conservative, and their essential message is 'get bureaucracy off our backs,' which used to be a part of what the Republicans believed,\\" said Mr. Bush, brother of President George W. Bush and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, in an appearance on \\"The Sports Junkies\\" show on WJFK- FM, 106.7 The Fan. He said that a list of controversies made Clinton untrustworthy, and cited Trump's negativity.Fox News: Surprise as George W Bush’s brother Marvin endorses Gary Johnson He said: \\"Things like the commodity trading and Whitewater and Filegate and the email controversy today and all this stuff […] There's a pattern of deception there that's the reason her trust ratings are lower than almost any politician around.\\" Bush previously endorsed his brother Jeb Bush, who lost the Republican primary.New York Daily News: Youngest Bush family brother Marvin endorses Libertarian Gary Johnson instead of Trump Bush, who supported his brother Jeb in the Republican primary, criticized both GOP candidate Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on the sports show. \\"Some of these kids are saying the best way to win is rip somebody's a-- apart, somebody else's a-- apart, and to run them down,\\" he said of Trump's impact on the country. His announcement was consistent with his family's general opposition to Trump. In the Republican primaries, however, another Bush brother, Neil Bush, joined the Ted Cruz election campaign on the finance team.

It offered a wide range of professional services to both public and private customers, most notably the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Law Enforcement organizations, foreign governments, government agencies and commercial businesses. L-3 MPRI was based in Alexandria, Virginia. L-3 MPRI's President was retired US Army General Bantz J. Craddock. The CEO was Carl E. Vuono. History Incorporated in 1987 and founded as MPRI by eight former senior military leaders. Former Army Chief of Staff Carl E. Vuono joined MPRI in 1993. General William F. Kernan of the U.S. Army also joined the firm after his military service. Acquired in June 2000, L-3 MPRI is a division of L-3 Communications Corporation. L-3 specializes in Command, Control and Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C3ISR), government services, training and simulation, and aircraft modernization and maintenance, and has a broad base of electronic systems. L-3 is also a major provider of homeland defense products and services. L-3 MPRI was included in the spin off L-3's Government Services group to create a new independent company ENGILITY Corporation. Training MPRI began by almost exclusively employing retired U.S. military personnel. It used retired military personnel and current U.S. National Guard or reservists, to run Reserve Officer Training Corps programs at more than 200 universities. Other employees have worked in U.S. Army recruitment centers and trained U.S. soldiers. With offices in other countries, employees also have trained foreign armies at ranges in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iraq, Kuwait, and South Africa. MPRI reassures their clients with services from teams of military leaders, law enforcement officers, strategic analysts, disaster management experts, and diplomatic and private sector leaders. In 1995-96 before Operation Storm, there is considerable circumstantial evidence to suggest that MPRI prepared and trained the Croatian Army for its offensive to retake the Krajina region. In April 1995, Democracy Transition Assistance Program (DTAP) training began at the \\"Petar Zrinski\\" military school in Zagreb. Deborah Avant discusses the controversy in her book The Market for Force: The Consequences of Privatizing Security.Avant, 2005, p.103, citing stories in the London Sunday Telegraph, US News and World Report, and Economist, 1995. MPRI provided (along with a French Foreign Legion organized training camp in Šepurine near Zadar) mainly training for commissioned officers, but a 1999 study published in the journal of the U.S. Army War College concluded that the company had no significant intelligence activities or professional influence on senior Croatian military strategy and tactics.  Its engagement was approved by the U.S. government. Local forces in Croatia were referred to MPRI by the United States Department of Defense and used their training. 120 African leaders and more than 5,500 African troops have been trained by MPRI on security issues. MPRI started training the Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina for $140 million, after 1995 when the Dayton Accords were established.How 'Operation Storm' Destabilized the Balkans, Written by JUGOISTOK Belgrade, Serbia On the back of its success in Croatia, MPRI won the approximately $50 million ‘Train and Equip’ contract for the Bosnian Federation army, which ran from July 1996.Singer, 2003, 128-129 The training contract was accompanied by an approximately $100 million arms transfer programme. The contract began with restructuring the Ministry of Defence and claimed to create a combined logistics system between the initial separate Muslim and Croat armies. While the contractors claimed they had combined the logistics system, assessments made in the 2000s disagreed: ‘the force integration of the Federation army has been superficial and limited to some cooperation at the HQ level.’ The contract also included development of training policy, assisting with unit training, establishment of a central combat training centre, including a school at Hadzici and a field combat simulation centre at Livno. While the facilities may have been constructed, whether the training and logistics systems changes lasted is uncertain, given Maxwell’s assessment.Rohan Maxwell, 'Bosnia and Herzegovina 1.1,' paper given at the 'New Armies from Old' Conference, Carlisle Barracks, PA, 2010 MPRI trained security forces used to defeat an attack on the presidential palace of Equatorial Guinea's long-serving dictator Teodoro Obiang Nguema.More of the World's Worst Dictators. Number 14. Parade. Defense contracts In the early 1990s, MPRI signed a 5-year contract with the U.S. State Department involving the shipment of donated medical supplies and food to former Soviet states. In 1998, the government of Equatorial Guinea asked MPRI to evaluate its defense systems, particularly its need for a coast guard to protect its oil reserves. In order to take the job, MPRI needed a license from the U.S. State Department. The Clinton administration rejected the request, citing the West African nation's human rights record. In 2000, after lobbying by MPRI, the State Department issued the license. MPRI did not reveal the terms of its contract with Equatorial Guinea. In 1999 MPRI signed an 18-month, $4.3 million contract to work with military in Colombia on the drug war. The contract expired in March 2001 and was not renewed allegedly because the Colombian Defense Ministry and its officers were upset by recommendations such as \\"Hit the enemy with a closed fist; do not poke at him with fingers of an open hand.\\" (Note: this is a maxim of World War II German General Heinz Guderian.) According to a United States Department of Defense census, MPRI has at least 500 employees working in Iraq on 12 different contracts including mentoring civilian workers at the Ministry of Defense. MPRI under a US Department of Defense contract conducted training and advisory services for the Afghan National Army (ANA). Also supported in various areas logistical and advisory services in regional areas of Afghanistan. MPRI is a contractor for the US State Department Bureau of African Affairs with training in African countries to include Uganda, with emphasis on pre-deployment training of UPDF en route to support African Union initiatives in Somalia. Lawsuit A group of Serbs who lived in Krajina until Operation Storm sued MPRI accusing them for \\"participation in genocide\\", militarily equipping the Croatian Armed Forces, training the Croatian officers and developing a plan of Operation Storm. The claim was presented to the Federal Court in Chicago, and plaintiffs were asking for $10.4 billion compensation.RTS: Срби из Чикага туже америчку фирму због \\"Олује\\"RTS: \\"Олуја\\" пред америчким судом On September 26, 2014 the lawsuit was rejected by Judge John Lee because the war in former Yugoslavia is not under jurisdiction of this court.http://www.jutarnji.hr/-mi-nismo-za-to- nadlezni--sud-u-chicagu-odbacio-tuzbu-srba-zbog-vojne-akcije-oluja/1223238/ References  Further reading  * Deborah Avant, 'The Market for Force: The Consequences of Privatising Security,' Cambridge University Press, 2005 * Fred Tanner, Security Sector Reform: Lessons from Bosnia and Hercegovina, Geneva Centre for Security Policy, paper prepared for DCAF-IISS Workshop on Security Sector Reform, 23–24 April 2001 External links * America’s For- Profit Secret Army Category:International Stability Operations Association Category:Companies based in Alexandria, Virginia Category:Private military contractors Category:American companies established in 1987 ","title":"Military Professional Resources Inc."},{"id":"310230","text":"Engraving of Fra Paolo Sarpi by George Vertue (1684–1756) Paolo Sarpi, Calcografia Bettoni, Milan, 1824 Paolo Sarpi (14 August 1552 – 15 January 1623) was a Venetian historian, prelate, scientist, canon lawyer, and statesman active on behalf of the Venetian Republic during the period of its successful defiance of the papal interdict (1605–1607) and its war (1615–1617) with Austria over the Uskok pirates. His writings, frankly polemical and highly critical of the Catholic Church and its Scholastic tradition, \\"inspired both Hobbes and Edward Gibbon in their own historical debunkings of priestcraft.\\"Nadon, \\"Paolo Sarpi and the Venetian Interdict\\" in Enlightenment and Secularism: Essays on the Mobilization of Reason, p. 20. Sarpi's major work, the History of the Council of Trent (1619), was published in London in 1619; other works: a History of Ecclesiastical Benefices, History of the Interdict and his Supplement to the History of the Uskoks, appeared posthumously. Organized around single topics, they are early examples of the genre of the historical monograph.Peter Burke, editor and translator, The History of Benefices and Selections from the History of the Council of Trent, by Paolo Sarpi (New York: Washington Square Press, 1962), p. xxvii. As a defender of the liberties of Republican Venice and proponent of the separation of Church and state, Sarpi attained fame as a hero of republicanism and free thought and possible crypto Protestant.Sarpi \\"indeed was the most widely translated Italian author in England between 1620–1720,\\" Christopher Nadon, \\"Paolo Sarpi and the Venetian Interdict\\" in Enlightenment and Secularism: Essays on the Mobilization of Reason, Christopher Nadon, editor (Lexington Books, 2013), p. 20. His last words, \\"Esto perpetua\\" (\\"may she [i.e., the republic] live forever\\"), were recalled by John Adams in 1820 in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, when Adams \\"wished 'as devoutly as Father Paul for the preservation of our vast American empire and our free institutions', as Sarpi had wished for the preservation of Venice and its institutions.\\"David C. Hendrickson, Professor of International relations at Colorado College, \\"Venice and the Liberty of States\\", IR and all that : Classic Readings on International Relations, December 13, 2013. Sarpi was also an experimental scientist, a proponent of the Copernican system, a friend and patron of Galileo Galilei, Richard Cavendish, \\"Galileo observes the satellites of Jupiter\\", History Today: 60: (Jan. 2009). and a keen follower of the latest research on anatomy, astronomy, and ballistics at the University of Padua. His extensive network of correspondents included Francis Bacon and William Harvey. Sarpi believed that government institutions should rescind their censorship of Avvisi—the newsletters which started to be common in his time—and instead of censorship publish their own version so as to combat enemy publication. Acting himself in that spirit, Sarpi published several pamphlets in defense of Venice's rights over the Adriatic. As such, Sarpi could be considered as an early advocate of the Freedom of the Press, though the concept did not yet exist in his lifetime.  Early years  He was born Pietro Sarpi in Venice. His father was a merchant, although not a successful one, his mother a Venetian noblewoman.Burke, The History of Benefices and Selections from the History of the Council of Trent, by Paolo Sarpi, p. x. While he was still a child his father died. The brilliant and precocious boy was educated by his maternal uncle, a school teacher, and then by Giammaria Capella, a monk in the Augustinian Servite order. At the age of thirteen he entered the Servite order in 1566, assuming the name of Fra (Brother) Paolo, by which, with the epithet Servita, he was always known to his contemporaries.\\"Paolo Sarpi (1552–1623)\\". The Galileo Project. Retrieved on 13 November 2008. Sarpi was assigned to a monastery in Mantua around 1567. In 1570 he sustained theses at a disputation there, and was invited to remain as court theologian to Duke Guglielmo Gonzaga. Sarpi remained four years at Mantua, studying mathematics and oriental languages. He then went to Milan in 1575, where he was an adviser to Charles Borromeo, the saint and bishopRichard Tuck, Philosophy and Government 1572–1651 (Cambridge University Press, 1993). . p. 97. but was transferred by his superiors to Venice, as professor of philosophy at the Servite convent. In 1579, he became Provincial of the Venetian Province of the Servite order, while studying at the University of Padua. At the age of twenty-seven he was appointed Procurator General for the order. In this capacity he was sent to Rome, where he interacted with three successive popes, as well as the grand inquisitor and other influential people. Sarpi returned to Venice in 1588 and passed the next 17 years in study, occasionally interrupted by the internal disputes of his community. In 1601, he was recommended by the Venetian senate for the bishopric of Caorle, but the papal nuncio, who wished to obtain it for a protégé of his own, accused Sarpi of having denied the immortality of the soul and controverted the authority of Aristotle. An attempt to obtain another bishopric in the following year also failed, Pope Clement VIII having taken offense at Sarpi's habit of corresponding with learned heretics.  Venice in conflict with the Pope  Clement VIII died in March 1605, and the attitude of his successor Pope Paul V strained the limits of papal prerogative. Venice simultaneously adopted measures to restrict it: the right of the secular tribunals to take cognizance of the offences of ecclesiastics had been asserted in two leading cases and the scope of two ancient laws of the city, that were: one forbidding the foundation of new churches or ecclesiastical congregations without the consent of the state, the other forbidding acquisition of property by priests or religious bodies. These laws had been extended over the entire territory of the republic. In January 1606, the papal nuncio delivered a brief demanding the unconditional submission of the Venetians. The senate promised protection to all ecclesiastics who should in this emergency aid the republic by their counsel. Sarpi presented a memoir, pointing out that the threatened censures might be met in two ways – de facto, by prohibiting their publication, and de jure, by an appeal to a general council. The document was well received, and Sarpi was made canonist and theological counsellor to the republic. The following April, hopes of compromise were dispelled by Paul's excommunication of the Venetians and his attempt to lay their dominions under an interdict. Sarpi entered energetically into the controversy. It was unprecedented for an ecclesiastic of his eminence to argue the subjection of the clergy to the state. Contemporary diaries published by Enrico Cornet (Vienna, 1859) relate the incidents of the Venetian dispute from day to day. He began by republishing the anti-papal opinions of the canonist Jean Gerson (1363–1429). In an anonymous tract published shortly afterwards (Risposta di un Dottore in Teologia), he laid down principles which struck radically at papal authority in secular matters. This book was promptly included in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, and Cardinal Bellarmine attacked Gerson's work with severity. Sarpi then replied in an Apologia. The Considerazioni sulle censure and the Trattato dell' interdetto, the latter partly prepared under his direction by other theologians, soon followed. Numerous other pamphlets appeared, inspired or controlled by Sarpi, who had received the further appointment of censor of everything written at Venice in defence of the republic. Following Sarpi's advice, the Venetian clergy largely disregarded the interdict and discharged their functions as usual, the major exception being the Jesuits, who left and were simultaneously expelled officially.Eric Cochrane (1988) Italy 1530–1630. Longman. . p. 262. The Catholic powers France and Spain refused to be drawn into the quarrel and resorted to diplomacy. At length (April 1607), a compromise was arranged through the mediation of King Henry IV of France which salvaged the pope's dignity but conceded the points at issue. The two priests were returned to Rome but with Venice reserving the right to try clergy in civil courts. The outcome proved not so much the defeat of papal pretensions as the recognition that interdicts and excommunication had lost their force. \\"The Republic,” said Sarpi, “has given a shake to papal claims. For whoever heard till now of a papal interdict, published with all solemnity, ending in smoke?” Quoted in Vincent Cronin, \\"Paolo Sarpi: Italian Theologian\\", article in the Online Encyclopedia Britannica Assassination attempt Statue of Paolo Sarpi, Campo Santa Fosca, Venice, near the place where he was stabbed by the pope's assassins The republic rewarded Sarpi with the distinction of State Counsellor in Jurisprudence and the liberty of access to the state archives. These honours exasperated his adversaries, particularly Pope Paul V. In September 1607, at the instigation of the pope and his nephew Cardinal Scipio Borghese, Fra Sarpi became the target of an assassination attempt. An unfrocked friar and brigand by the name of Rotilio Orlandini agreed to kill Sarpi for the sum of 8,000 crowns, assisted by Orlandini's two brothers-in-law.The Cambridge Modern History, Volume 4: Fra Paolo Sarpi (Cambridge University Press 1906), p. 671 However, Orlandini's plot was discovered, and when the three assassins crossed from Papal into Venetian territory they were arrested and imprisoned.Robertson, Alexander (1893) Fra Paolo Sarpi: the Greatest of the Venetians, London: Sampson, Low, Marston & Co. pp. 114–117 On 5 October 1607 Sarpi was attacked by assassins and left for dead with three stiletto thrusts,Letter to Jerome del’Isle Groslot, 11 December 1607, in The Letters of the Renowned Father Paul, translated out of Italian by Edward Brown, 1693, p.6 (Google Books edition https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=xoi1M1pYpUYC&hl;=en_GB&pg;=GBS.PA6) but he recovered. His attackers found both refuge and a welcome reception in the papal territories (described by a contemporary as a \\"triumphal march\\"), and papal enthusiasm for the assassins only cooled after learning that Brother Sarpi was not dead after all. The leader of the assassins, Poma, declared that he had attempted the murder for religious reasons. Sarpi himself, when his surgeon commented on the ragged and inartistic character of the wounds, quipped dryly, \\"Agnosco stylum Romanae Curiae\\" (\\"I recognize the style of the Roman Curia\\").A triple play on the word \\"stylus\\" as writing implement, pen, and dagger, \\"in an age of vicious play on words, one of the most notable puns of all time\\" (John Humphreys Whitfield and John Robert Woodhouse, A Short History of Italian Literature [Manchester University Press, 1980], p. 187). Sarpi's would-be assassins settled in Rome, and were eventually granted a pension by the viceroy of Naples, Pedro Téllez-Girón, 3rd Duke of Osuna.David Wootton, Paolo Sarpi: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment (Cambridge University Press, 1983 ), p. 2. Later life Paolo Sarpi, 1777, attributed to engraver William Dickinson The remainder of Sarpi's life was spent peacefully in his cloister, though plots against him continued to be formed, and he occasionally spoke of taking refuge in England. When not engaged in preparing state papers, he devoted himself to scientific studies, and composed several works. He served the state to the last. The day before his death, he had dictated three replies to questions on affairs of the Venetian Republic, and his last words were \\"Esto perpetua,\\" or \\"may she endure forever.\\" These words were adopted as the state motto of Idaho and appear on the back of the 2007 Idaho quarter, as well as being taken up by various other groups and bodies in different countries (see \\"Esto perpetua\\").  History of the Council of Trent  Istoria del Concilio tridentino, 1935 In 1619 his chief literary work, Istoria del Concilio Tridentino (History of the Council of Trent), was printed at London, published under the name of Pietro Soave Polano, an anagram of Paolo Sarpi Veneto (plus o). The editor, Marco Antonio de Dominis, did some work on polishing the text. He has been accused of falsifying it, but a comparison with a manuscript corrected by Sarpi himself shows that the alterations are unimportant. Translations into other languages followed: there were the English translation by Nathaniel Brent The historie of the Councel of Trent Conteining eight bookes.

This was unofficial history, rather than a commission, and treated ecclesiastical history as politics.William J. Bouwsma, Venice and the Defense of Liberty, pp. 568–69. Sarpi in Mantua had known Camillo Olivo, secretary to Cardinal Ercole Gonzaga.Wootton, Paolo Sarpi: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment, p. 8. His attitude, \\"bitterly realistic\\" for John Hale, was coupled with a criticism that the Tridentine settlement was not conciliatory but designed for further conflict.John Hale (1993) The Civilization of Europe in the Renaissance. Simon and Schuster. . p. 138. Denys Hay calls it \\"a kind of Anglican picture of the debates and decisions\\",Denys Hay, Annalists and Historians (1977), p. 140. and Sarpi was much read by Protestants; John Milton called him the \\"great unmasker\\". Sarpi's work attained such fame that the Vatican opened its archives to Cardinal Francesco Sforza Pallavicino, whom it commissioned to write a three volume rebuttal, entitled the Istoria del Concilio di Trento, scritta dal P. Sforza Pallavicino, della Comp. di Giesù ove insieme rifiutasi con auterevoli testimonianze un Istoria falsa divolgata nello stesso argomento sotto nome di Petro Soave Polano (\\"The History of the Council of Trent written by P. Sforza Pallavicino, of the Company of Jesus, in which a false history upon the same argument put forth under the name of Petro Soave Polano is refuted by means of authoritative testimony\\", 1656–1657).Catholic Encyclopedia entry: \\"Pietro Sforza Pallavicino\\". The great nineteenth century historian Leopold von Ranke (History of the Popes), examined both Sarpi and Pallavicino's treatments of manuscript materials and judged them both as falling short of his own strict standards of objectivity, but he rated the quality of Sarpi's work very highly, nevertheless, considering him superior to Guicciardini.Burke, The History of Benefices and Selections from the History of the Council of Trent, by Paolo Sarpi, p. xxix. Sarpi never acknowledged his authorship, and baffled all the efforts of Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé to extract the secret from him. Hubert Jedin's multi-volume history of the Council of Trent (1961), also Vatican authorized, likewise faults Sarpi's use of sources.The first two volumes of this, definitive history of the council, have been translated into English and published by the American Council of Learned Societies as A History of the Council of Trent Volume I: The Struggle for the Council and A History of the Council of Trent Volume II: The First Sessions at Trent, 1545-1547 (2008). David Wootton believes, however, that there is evidence Sarpi may have used original documents that have not survived and he calls Sarpi's treatment of Council quite careful despite its partisan framing.Wootton, Paolo Sarpi: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment, pp. 104–105. Other works In 1615, a dispute occurred between the Venetian government and the Inquisition over the prohibition of a book. In 1613 the Senate had asked Sarpi to write about the history and procedure of the Venetian Inquisition. He argued that this had been set up in 1289, but as a Venetian state institution. The pope of the time, Nicholas IV, had merely consented to its creation.Brian Pullan (1998) The Jews of Europe and the Inquisition of Venice, 1550–1670. I. B. Tauris. . p. 15. This work appeared in English translation by Robert Gentilis in 1639. A Machiavellian tract on the fundamental maxims of Venetian policy (Opinione come debba governarsi la repubblica di Venezia), used by his adversaries to blacken his memory, dates from 1681.John Jeffries Martin, John Martin, Dennis Romano (2000) Venice Reconsidered: The History and Civilization of an Italian City- state, 1297–1797. JHU Press. . p. 495. He did not complete a reply which he had been ordered to prepare to the Squitinio delia libertà veneta, which he perhaps found unanswerable. In folio appeared his History of Ecclesiastical Benefices, in which, says Matteo Ricci, \\"he purged the church of the defilement introduced by spurious decretals.\\" It appeared in English translation in 1736 with a biography by John Lockman. In 1611, he attacked misuse of the right of asylum claimed for churches, in a work that was immediately placed on the Index. His posthumous History of the Interdict was printed at Venice the year after his death, with the disguised imprint of Lyon. Sarpi's memoirs on state affairs remained in the Venetian archives. Consul Smith's collection of tracts in the Interdict controversy went to the British Museum. Francesco Griselini's Memorie e aneddote (1760) was based on Sarpi's unpublished writings, later destroyed by book burning. Correspondence networks and published letters Sarpi was the center of a vast political and scholarly network of eminent correspondents, from which about 430 of his letters have survived. Early letter collections were: \\"Lettere Italiane di Fra Sarpi\\" (Geneva, 1673); Scelte lettere inedite de P. Sarpi\\", edited by Aurelio Bianchi-Giovini (Capolago, 1833); \\"Lettere raccolte di Sarpi\\", edited by Polidori (Florence, 1863); \\"Lettere inedite di Sarpi a S. Contarini\\", edited by Castellani (Venice, 1892).\\"Paolo Sarpi\\". New Advent. Some hitherto unpublished letters of Sarpi were edited by Karl Benrath and published, under the title Paolo Sarpi. Neue Briefe, 1608–1610 (at Leipzig in 1909). A modern edition (1961) Lettere ai Gallicani has been published of his hundreds of letters to French correspondents. These are mainly to jurists: Jacques Auguste de Thou, Jacques Lechassier, Jacques Gillot. Another correspondent was William Cavendish, 2nd Earl of Devonshire; English translations by Thomas Hobbes of 45 letters to the Earl were published (Hobbes acted as the Earl's secretary), and it is now thought that these are jointly from Sarpi (when alive) and his close friend Fulgenzio Micanzio, something concealed at the time as a matter of prudence.Filippo de Vivo, \\"Paolo Sarpi and the Uses of Information in Seventeenth-Century Venice” in News Networks in Seventeenth Century Britain and Europe, Joad Raymond, editor (Routledge, 2006), p. 37. Micanzio was also in touch with Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester.Aloysius Martinich, Hobbes: A Biography (Cambridge University Press, 1999. ), p. 38. Giusto Fontanini's Storia arcana della vita di Pietro Sarpi (1863), a bitter libel, is important for the letters of Sarpi it contains. Views Paolo Sarpi Sarpi read and was influenced by the skepticism of Michel de Montaigne and his disciple Pierre Charron.Gianni Paganini The Return of Scepticism: From Hobbes and Descartes to Bayle (Springer, 2000 ), p. 328. As an historian and thinker in the realist tradition of Tacitus, Machiavelli, and Guicciardini, he stressed that patriotism as national pride or honor could play a central role in social control.Richard Tuck, (1993) Philosophy and Government 1572–1651 (Cambridge University Press, 1993 ), pp. 98–99. At various times during his lifetime he was suspected of a lack of orthodoxy in religion: he appeared before the Inquisition around 1575, in 1594, and in 1607.\\"Robert A. Hatch, \\"The Scientific Revolution\\". clas.ufl.edu Sarpi hoped for toleration of Protestant worship in Venice, and he hoped for the establishment of a Venetian free church by which the decrees of the council of Trent would have been rejected. Sarpi discusses his intimate beliefs and motives in his correspondence with Christoph von Dohna, envoy to Venice for Christian I, Prince of Anhalt- Bernburg.Published by Moritz Ritter in the Briefe und Acten zur Geschichte des dreissigjährigen Krieges, vol. ii. (Munich, 1874). Sarpi told Dohna that he greatly disliked saying Mass, and celebrated it as seldom as possible, but that he was compelled to do so, as he would otherwise seem to admit the validity of the papal prohibition. Sarpi's maxim was that \\"God does not regard externals so long as the mind and heart are right before Him.\\" Another maxim Sarpi formulated to Dohna was: Le falsità non dico mai mai, ma la verità non a ognuno (\\"I never, never tell falsehoods, but the truth I do not tell to everyone.\\"). Sarpi at the end of his life wrote to Daniel Heinsius that he favored the Calvinist Contra-Remonstrants' side at the Synod of Dort.Hugh Trevor-Roper, From Counter-Revolution to Glorious Revolution (1992), p. 96. Yet, although Sarpi corresponded with James I of England and admired the English Book of Common Prayer, Catholic theologian Le Courayer in the 18th century wrote that Sarpi was no a Protestant, terming him, \\"Catholique en gros et quelque fois Protestant en détail\\" (\\"Catholic in general and sometimes Protestant in detail\\"). In the twentieth century William James Bouwsma found Sarpi to have been a philo-Protestant “whose religious ideas were nevertheless “consistent with Catholic orthodoxy”,Jaska Kainulainen, Paolo Sarpi: A Servant of God and State (Brill, 2014), p. 127. and Eric Cochrane described him as deeply religious in the typical spirit of the Counter-Reformation.Kainulainen, p. 127. Corrado Vivanti saw Sarpi as a religious reformer who aspired toward an ecumenical church,Kainulainen, Paolo Sarpi: A Servant of God and State, p. 127. and historian Diarmaid MacCulloch describes Sarpi as having moved away from dogmatic Christianity.Diarmaid MacCulloch, Reformation: Europe's House Divided 1490–1700 (Penguin, 2003 ), p. 409. On the other hand, in 1983 David Wootton made a startling case for Sarpi as a scientific materialist and thus as likely a \\"veiled\\" atheist who was \\"hostile to Christianity itself\\" and whose politics looked forward to a secular society unrealizable in his own time,Wootton, Paolo Sarpi: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment, p. 2. See also . a thesis that has won some acceptance.Eric Cochrane responded by calling Wootton's thesis a work of \\"cryptography\\" rather than history and accused him of either not having read or else with having suppressed contradictory evidence from the scholars cited in his comprehensive bibliography. See Eric Cochrane, review of Wootton's Paolo Sarpi: Between Renaissance and Enlightenment in The Journal of Modern History: 57: 1 (March 1985): 151–53. Despite this, several scholars have accepted Wootton's theory, including A. P. Martinich, Richard Tuck, Paul A. Rahe, and Gianluca Mori. See Kainulainen, Paolo Sarpi: a Servant of God and State (Brill, 2014), p. 127. Jaska Kainulainen, on the other hand, asserts that the thesis that Sarpi was an atheist contradicts the historical record, observing that neither Sarpi's pronounced skepticism nor his pessimistic view of capabilities are incompatible with religious faith: > Sarpi’s writings do not support the claim that he was an atheist. In fact, > from an atheistic point of view, systematic skepticism can be seen as > providing support of religious belief, because atheists’ position postulates > certain knowledge of God’s inexistence. ...In his case the fundamental > question was not the existence of God, but whether knowledge of God was > obtainable by reason or by faith. His response was unequivocal: he was > convinced that knowledge of divine matters was attained sola fide and he > explicitly claimed that in religious matters one could not make judgments > based on reason, but instead, they had to be based on affection or > feelingKainulainen, Paolo Sarpi: A Servant of God and State, pp. 129-30. Kainulainen identifies Sarpi as a fideist, neo-Stoic, and Christian mortalist, who, although critical of the Church of Rome, admired the purity of the early church. Scientific scholar Sarpi wrote notes on François Viète which established his proficiency in mathematics, and a metaphysical treatise now lost, which is said to have anticipated the ideas of John Locke. His anatomical pursuits probably date from an earlier period. They illustrate his versatility and thirst for knowledge, but are otherwise not significant. His claim to have anticipated William Harvey's discovery rests on no better authority than a memorandum, probably copied from Andreas Caesalpinus or Harvey himself, with whom, as well as with Francis Bacon and William Gilbert, Sarpi corresponded. The only physiological discovery which can be safely attributed to him is that of the contractility of the iris. Sarpi wrote on projectile motion in the period 1578–84, in the tradition of Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia; and then again in reporting on Guidobaldo del Monte's ideas in 1592, possibly by then having met Galileo Galilei. Galileo corresponded with him. Sarpi heard of the telescope in November 1608, perhaps before Galileo. Details then came to Sarpi from Giacomo Badoer in Paris, in a letter describing the configuration of lenses. In 1609, the Venetian Republic had a telescope on approval for military purposes, but Sarpi had them turn it down, anticipating the better model Galileo had made and brought later that year.Michael Sharratt, Galileo: Decisive Innovator (Cambridge University Press, 1994 ), pp. 13–15.  Further reading  Sarpi's life was first recounted in a laudatory memorial tribute by his secretary and successor, Fulgenzio Micanzio and much of our information about him comes from this. Several biographies dating from the nineteenth century include that by Arabella Georgina Campbell (1869), with references to manuscripts, Pietro Balan's Fra Paolo Sarpi (Venice, 1887), and Alessandro Pascolato, Fra Paolo Sarpi (Milan, 1893). The late William James Bouwsma's Venice and the Defense of Republican Liberty: Renaissance Values in the Age of the Counter- Reformation ([1968] Yale University Press; re-issued by the University of California Press, 1984) arose initially from Bouwsma's interest in Sarpi. Its central chapters concern Sarpi' life and works, including a lengthy analysis of the style and content of his History of the Council of Trent. Bouwsma's final publication, The Waning of the Renaissance, 1550-1640 (Yale University Press, 2002) also deals extensively with Sarpi.

History 1960s–1970s The first TV broadcast became reality during the 25th Thessaloniki International Fair (3 September 1960). The Studios were organized in the Power Corporation of Greece (ΔΕΗ) pavilion, with Philips supplied and other locally improvised equipment. Some years later, a small private station started operating round the year from another pavilion in the very same Fair. This station operated until 1968 when the two new government channels started operation in Thessaloniki and requested the elimination of the \\"Illegal\\" station. The two government channels, television being a government monopoly, during that period were ERT and YENED (for the military forces). After the construction of the OTE Tower (Hellenic Telecommunications Corporation) in the Thessaloniki Fair area, OTE started a third state TV channel in SECAM color. The two initial state channels requested the closing and elimination of the new OTE channel, fearing that OTE would drive them to close, because of the superiority of the color picture, the telecommunications network and the technical superiority of OTE. They succeeded and all the equipment, that OTE already had, passed to YENED, which started what now became ERT3 (the third national channel, broadcasting from Thessaloniki). During the Greek military government period of 1967–74, the programme was a mixture of news and entertainment. A notable serial which still owns the watching record was the war drama O Agnostos Polemos (The Unknown War). After the restoration of the Republic in 1974, Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation ERT continue to dominate, appealing to a much larger audience than YENED. Color television broadcasts began in the late 1970s. Notable people were placed to improve the quality of the national channels, such as Dimitris Horn, Manos Hatzidakis and the Nobel laureate poet Odysseas Elytis. Finally ERT incorporated YENED. TV 100 (1988) is the first non-state TV station in Greece. It belongs to the Municipality of Thessaloniki, founded in 1988 by the then mayor of the city Sotiris Kouvelas, who served as mayor until 1989 and a year later, he founded TV station with national coverage in Athens. 1980s In 1982, ERT and YENED merged, forming \\"ERT\\" (Ellinikí Radiofonía Tileórasi), with ERT becoming \\"ERT1\\" and YENED becoming \\"ERT2\\". Broadcasts originally lasted for seven to eight hours daily starting at about 5:30PM with children shows and then the first televised news of the day. In 1987 an experimental teletext type information screen known as \\"Tilegrafos\\" (meaning televised words, i.e. telegraph) showed written information on ET2 during the afternoon. By the late 1980s, television broadcasts on ET1 and ET2 (still commonly known as ERT-1 and ERT-2 until later years) had increased to 12–15 hours daily, though it was still common for one or both stations to sign off briefly in the afternoon and sign back on in the early evening hours. Some illegal broadcasts made short-lived appearances during the 1980s showing mainly movies of adult nature but, in 1987, the City of Thessaloniki began rebroadcasting in a TV frequency parts of European satellite channels, leading to a dispute between the government and the city, as the stations' equipment was confiscated numerous times. The more serious challenge to ERT's TV monopoly, however, appeared with the establishment and operation of TV Plus in the Athens/Piraeus area, which begun broadcasting major US films to the starved-for-diversity Athens public. It is then that ERT decided to pre-empt the challenge to its TV monopoly and any further attempts to put private broadcasts on the air, by re-broadcasting itself foreign satellite channels. In October 1988, the first of these satellite channels made it to the airwaves in Athens to block the frequency used by TV Plus, and as this by-now very popular TV station kept changing its frequency, more and more satellite channels were added by ERT to block the frequencies used by TV Plus. They included: NBC Europe from Great Britain, TV5Monde from France, Sat.1 from Germany, Rai 2 from Italy, and Soviet Central Television via Horizon satellite. These stations were soon followed by MTV Europe and Sky from the United Kingdom, while the broadcasts of Super Channel was taken over by TV Plus, due to the lack of an actual agreement with ERT. Sky eventually morphed into what is now known as Eurosport, which is still rebroadcast in Greece, and Euronews, Rai 1 and Cyprus SAT were eventually added to the lineup. For a short time, NBC Europe was also rebroadcast, as were RTL Plus from Germany and 3sat. In 1988, ERT also established ET3 a regional state-owned network which focused on issues of Northern Greece, to counter the Athens-centric broadcasts of the other two major state broadcasters at the time. Initially a regional network based in Thessaloniki, ET3 also began broadcasting in Athens, and within a few years, in most other regions of the country. Thessaloniki was the home of Greece's first non-state owned television station, TV100, owned by the City of Thessaloniki, and TV Plus was the first non-state television station in the Athens region. TV Plus, was owned by Invest Plus SA, a US group headed by Daniel Bourla, with the participation of the Municipality of Piraeus, and its programming was quite innovative for Greek standards at the time, as it broadcast first-run Hollywood feature films with subtitles and no commercials. Soon, TV Plus began to offer an over-the-air subscription service, broadcasting an encoded signal 24-hours a day, which viewers could watch by obtaining a decoder (provided for free by the station) and paying a monthly subscription fee. This was especially revolutionary at the time, as a legal framework for private broadcasting, and private broadcasters, still did not exist in the country. ERT did not take too kindly to the new television stations which began to crop up on the dial following the governments unsuccessful attempts to stop TV Plus, often changing the frequencies of its own stations around or adding repeaters, to interfere with new private broadcasts. However, in 1989, the Greek Parliament finally passed legislation legalizing private broadcasting (radio and television) and providing provisional licenses to two broadcasters, Mega Channel and Nea Tileorasi (New Television). Mega Channel began officially broadcasting in November 1989 as a national network, while Nea Tileorasi, after several months of broadcasting test bars, disappeared from the airwaves. Other private broadcasters took advantage of loopholes in the existing legislation and the lack of an organized licensing process to begin broadcasting almost overnight. In December 1989, Antenna TV began broadcasting nationally, named after the successful new radio station by the same name. Mega and Antenna featured similar programming styles, with locally produced comedies and dramas, numerous variety shows (following in the Italian tradition), American films, and tabloid news broadcasts. They immediately won over most of ERT's audience and advertising share, and to this day, are interchangeably the #1 and #2 stations in the audience ratings in Greece, while the ratings of ET1, ET2, and ET3 plummeted (they have recovered significantly since then but still do not challenge the major private networks). 1990s By early 1990, numerous other stations also appeared on the air, including New Channel (no relation to Nea Tileorasi) with movies, music videos and talk shows, Channel Seven-X (with avant-garde programming including foreign films, intellectual programming and a simulcast of French music network MCM), Jeronimo Groovy TV (initially a popular music video station that broadcast in Athens, amidst serious interference from other stations), TeleCity (a right-wing political television station with news and talk shows), 902 TV (owned by the Communist Party of Greece), Kanali 29 (a television station with political and cultural programs and a cult following), and a plethora of other broadcasters, which filled every available VHF and UHF frequency, often broadcasting only for several weeks or months, or with very little programming of note. Many broadcasters even began to broadcast on the same frequencies as other stations, especially ERT's satellite broadcasts, many of which soon completely disappeared from the airwaves, as ERT seemed unwilling or unable to protect its frequencies. Similarly, private stations sprung up throughout the country, in every city and region and most towns. The color television transmission system SECAM which had been used since the late 1970s finally switched over to the PAL color system widely used in the rest of Europe. PAL was the system used for years in Greece via video tape playbacks on rented movies from video stores but not by ERT. The first TV station to broadcast in PAL was TV Plus, then by the other private TV stations that followed it and eventually by ERT. In 1993, two new major players entered the market. Skai TV began broadcasting, after a prolonged battle for open frequencies with ERT and other stations, and soon began to broadcast as a new national network following in the footsteps of the highly rated Skai radio station in Athens. Also in 1993, Kanali 29's management was handed over to Niko Mastorakis, who was once again involved in Greek media after a long stint as a movie producer and director in the United States. Kanali 29 was renamed Star Channel, and featured programming rich in American films and TV series, and talk and lifestyle programmes. Star also began to broadcast nationally. The following year, ERT decommissioned many of its terrestrial satellite broadcasts, and reassigned many of those now-vacant frequencies to Multichoice Hellas, for terrestrial pay-television services a year after TV Plus went off the air following a dispute with Time Warner that had acquired a 25% interest in the company. The name of this new pay-TV service was Filmnet. In 1995, Multichoice followed with another station, Supersport, which soon earned the broadcast rights to many Greek sports. In 1997, ERT, whose audience had never recovered from the advent of private television, and which up until then lagged behind technologically compared to the largest private networks, revamped its operations, unveiling new logos and a new programming philosophy. The stations were modernized, and ET2 was renamed \\"NET\\" (Nea Elliniki Tileorassi). ET1 focused on general-interest programming (movies, sports, various TV series), while NET focused heavily on news and talk programming. ET3 continued to focus largely on Northern Greece, with a large dose of cultural programming. By the late 1990s, Greece began to see its first major mergers and acquisitions (some of them ill-fated) in the realm of broadcast media. Skai TV was sold, and soon became known as \\"Alpha- Sky\\" before completely phasing into its new name as Alpha TV. Kanali 5, a regional television network broadcasting out of Athens, by the former owners of Kanali 29 (and with similar programming to that station), was also revamped, transitioning to \\"Alter 5\\" (with a program aimed largely at teenagers and young adults) before fully renaming itself to Alter. Its broadcast reach also gradually expanded, and the station now covers almost the entire country. Channel Seven-X, facing financial difficulties, was also sold, and was renamed Seven, featuring programming heavy on sports and news/talk programs. Seven never quite achieved the success of some of the other stations, as it continued to face financial difficulties even after the sale, and never was able to broadcast outside of certain large cities in the country. New Channel, which broadcast in many major cities but did not offer much original programming, was sold to a new investor and renamed \\"New Tempo\\" and finally \\"Tempo TV\\", building up a national network of repeaters in an effort to become a major player in the television market, which it partially succeeded in, before financial troubles led to its failure in 2001. Finally, Makedonia TV, a regional private network broadcasting out of Thessaloniki, was purchased by the Antenna TV group, and has served as a secondary network featuring many old programs from Antenna TV, American TV series, and a newscast focusing on Northern Greece. The station now also broadcasts nationally. Specialty networks had also begun to form. In 1992, TVC, Greece's first 24/24h music channel, began operating in Lesvos island. The channel during the 2000s reformed into the pan-European Music Force Europe, today available in 3 countries. Then, in 1996, Mad TV began operating out of Athens, replacing a small local channel known as Art 68. Mad TV featured programming heavy on hit music videos, similar to MTV and its Greek predecessor Jeronimo Groovy TV (which continued to exist but with a small coverage area and with programming more heavily dependent on talk); both channels, in opposition to TVC, operated in a few-hour rotation. Mad TV did not build a national network of its own, but instead was rebroadcast through local stations throughout the country. TV 0-6 began broadcasting in Athens, with many cartoons and children's shows, while TV Magic, after an ill-fated attempt to become a news- talk station owned by Sokratis Kokkalis, became a station focusing on sports and particularly of Greek sports club Olympiacos, which Kokkalis also owned. Extra Channel was founded in 2000 with a heavy talk focus, and is now known as Extra 3. In 1999, Multichoice Hellas also formed Nova, Greece's first satellite television subscription service, which initially featured most (but not all) of Greece's major networks, as well as many international networks, and other music and interactive services, which it has continued to expand since then. Nova was to be followed by a competing satellite platform, known as \\"Magna\\", by the owners of Seven, which never began operations. 2000s In 2000, Alpha TV founded Alpha Digital, which broadcast Alpha TV, Polis TV (a local station serving Athens owned by Alpha) various thematic stations also operated by Alpha, the radio stations owned by the Alpha group, and a small variety of foreign television networks, headlined by MTV and VH1 (MTV, by that time, was no longer rebroadcast terrestrially in Greece, that ceased in 1999). Despite the popularity of MTV and VH1 and Alpha earning the rights to Greek soccer matches, the company soon went under, leaving Nova as the only company providing pay-TV services in Greece to this day. Plans for a satellite bouquet managed by OTE (the Greek telecommunications company) never went past the test phase, with OTE leasing frequencies on the Hot Bird satellite, rebroadcasting several smaller Greek TV stations as well as many radio stations free-to-air. The past few years have seen the failure of many television ventures, but the creation and investment in many new ones. Polis TV was relaunched as Channel 9 in December 2005, with programming heavy on news and talk shows. More recently, the original owners of Skai TV returned to the television business, relaunching Skai on the frequencies of Seven TV. Other notable stations that have begun operating in recent years include Channel 10, while TeleCity was renamed Tileasty. Other stations have upgraded and modernized, however, the Greek airwaves are still cluttered with many unlicensed television stations, often broadcasting programs of a low quality (telemarketing, low budget movies, music videos, illegal telephone hotlines, soft pornography). To this day, the Greek government still has not issued official licenses to most television stations in Greece, which are currently broadcasting in a quasi- legal state. Tenders have been offered for national, regional and local broadcasts as well as terrestrial pay-TV services, which have either been frozen or have failed completely. Despite numerous government pledges, there has not been much movement on this issue in recent years. In the meantime, the airwaves are still cluttered, though things are significantly more organized than they were in the early 1990s. Despite the success of Nova, and the launch of Hellas Sat, cable TV has been slow to follow, only existing on a local level in some communities around Greece until recently, when companies such as OnTelecoms have launched cable (IPTV) platforms. 2010s By the early 2010s all the Greek television stations suffered by the consequences of the country's debt crisis. In this decade two major Panhellenic stations ceased operations due to economic difficulties. Alter stopped its operation on 10 February 2012, after a history of more than 20 years. The most channels cut their budget by decreasing their original programming (mostly the original series). Except for the high number of reruns, networks started airing a lot of foreign programs, the majority of them being Turkish drama shows. On 27 April 2011, the first transmission of a High Definition free-to-air channel was made by the state-owned ERT HD. Two years later, on 11 June 2013, the Greek Government suspended the operation of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) and automatically fired 2,600 workers, in one of the numerous spending cuts that have been implemented during Greece's ongoing debt crisis. The plug was pulled at 23:10 during the news. On 11 June 2015, the new Government (made up of SYRIZA & AN.EL. parties) reinstated the operations of ERT by hiring back the personnel and broadcasting the three ERT channels ERT1, ERT2, ERT3. On late 2013, the 902 TV, owned by the Greek Communist Party was sold to a Cypriot-based company A-Orizon Media Ltd. On 11 September, of the same year, the channel was renamed to Epsilon TV. After four years, the network once again sold, this time to Ivan Savides' company Dimera Media Investments Limited. On 24 August 2018, Epsilon TV was replaced by OPEN BEYOND. Since early 2016, the most Panhellenic networks began pilot High Definition transmissions to a limited number of cities. By the end of the same television season MEGA channel, the oldest privately owned national television station, stopped all live broadcasts, after the workers going on strike, having not being paid for several months. The network continued broadcasting only reruns of old shows for more than two years, however, its ratings didn't hit bottom. The network was forced to stop its transmission on 28 October 2018, at 02:08 am, after almost 3 decades from its launch. Viewers paid a tribute to the network at its final hours. Mega achieved a share of 17,5% (22,5% on 15–44 age group). By the end of 2019, Vaggelis Marinakis purchased the network's archives (programs, shows and footage) and logo. On 9 February 2019, ERT renamed its HD channel into ERT Sports HD. Now its program aims to sports. By the end of the decade, Greece had five national state-owned networks, four state-owned national digital television networks, a state-owned satellite broadcast network, and several national private television networks, in addition to approximately 150 local and regional television stations broadcasting across the country. Audience ratings were handled by AGB Hellas. The private networks were six, Ant1 (after Mega's closure the oldest), Alpha, Skai TV, Star Channel and OPEN BEYOND, operating from the Attica region and Makedonia TV operating from Thessaloniki. 2020s The 2020s show the reopening of the Mega Channel. After Vaggelis Marinakis' purchase of the channel's archive, he managed to relaunch Mega, under the same name and with a similar format (a combination of news programs, movies and Mega's old Greek TV shows). The network resumed broadcasting on 17 February 2020. Digital Terrestrial Television In 2005, Alpha TV briefly ran experimental broadcasts in DVB-T locally in Athens, while in Heraklion, Crete, a regional network, CreteTV, in conjunction with the University of Crete, also started digital operation. In January 2006, the State broadcaster ERT launched free-to-air Digital terrestrial television (DVB-T) with three \\"pilot\\" channels called Prisma+, Cine+ and Sport+, collectively branded as ERT Digital. The first channel, Prisma+, was targeted at disabled persons, while Cine+ broadcasts movies, and Sport+ broadcasts a sports program. A fourth channel, the Cypriot national channel's satellite program RIK sat, was also retransmitted on digital. In September 2009, the seven major television stations in Greece started broadcasting in DVB-T MPEG-4, via a company set up by them, Digea. The digital television transition was completed in February 2015 and a total of 156 digital transmitting centres are currently active throughout the country, broadcasting nationwide and regional channels and covering over 96% of the country's population. Cable TV First cable television operator in Greece, is located at Kalamaria (Thessaloniki). Hellenic Cable Networks (www.hcn.gr) among cable internet services offers digital video broadcasting - cable and analog TV services without the need of an external STB. IPTV In 2006 two companies began offering television service via IPTV, namely Vivodi Telecom and On Telecoms. Both of these went out of business. They offered television service bundled with High-speed Internet & Telephony services. Their channel offerings included local Greek networks, international stations and pay-TV networks Nova Cinema & Nova Sports, that were made available to subscribers via an agreement with Greek DTH provider NOVA. In 2009, Greek Telecommunications giant OTE launched IPTV service called Conn-x TV which was initially available in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patras, Larisa and Iraklion. Greek broadband provider Hellas Online also launched an IPTV platform called hol tv (now Vodafone TV). Vodafone TV offers all major Greek networks as well as news, sports, music and children's channels. It is also the first provider in Greece to offer HDTV as well as Video on demand.

Battery is a specific common law misdemeanor, although the term is used more generally to refer to any unlawful offensive physical contact with another person, and may be a misdemeanor or a felony, depending on the circumstances. Battery was defined at common law as \\"any unlawful and or unwanted touching of the person of another by the aggressor, or by a substance put in motion by him.\\" In more severe cases, and for all types in some jurisdictions, it is chiefly defined by statutory wording. Assessment of the severity of a battery is determined by local law.  Generally  Specific rules regarding battery vary among different jurisdictions, but some elements remain constant across jurisdictions. Battery generally requires that: # an offensive touch or contact is made upon the victim, instigated by the actor; and # the actor intends or knows that their action will cause the offensive touching. Under the US Model Penal Code and in some jurisdictions, there is battery when the actor acts recklessly without specific intent of causing an offensive contact. Battery is typically classified as either simple or aggravated. Although battery typically occurs in the context of physical altercations, it may also occur under other circumstances, such as in medical cases where a doctor performs a non-consented medical procedure.  Specific countries   Canada  Battery is not defined in the Canadian Criminal Code. Instead, the Code has an offense of assault, and assault causing bodily harm.  England and Wales  Battery is a common law offence within England and Wales. As with the majority of offences in the UK, it has two elements: * Actus reus: The defendant unlawfully touched or applied force to the victim * Mens rea: The defendant intended or was reckless as to the unlawful touch or application of force This offence is a crime against autonomy, with more violent crimes such as ABH and GBH being punishable under the Offences against the Person Act 1861. As such, even the slightest of touches can amount to an unlawful application of force.R v Afolabi [2017] EWHC 2960 However, it is assumed that everyday encounters (such as making contact with others on public transportation) are consented to and not punishable.Collins v Wilcock [1984] 3 ALL ER 374 (QBD) Much confusion can come between the terms 'assault' and 'battery'. In everyday use the term assault may be used to describe a physical attack, which is indeed a battery. An assault is causing someone to apprehend that you will commit a battery. This issue is so prevalent that the crime of sexual assaultSexual Offences Act 2003, Section 3 accessed 10 January 2018 would be better labelled a sexual battery. This confusion stems from the fact that both assault and battery can be referred to as common assault. There is no separate offence for a battery relating to domestic violence; however, the introduction of the crime of \\"controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship\\" in Section 76 of the Serious Crime Act 2015 has given rise to new sentencing guidelines that take into account significant aggravating factors such as abuse of trust, resulting in potentially longer sentences for acts of battery within the context of domestic violence.  Whether it is a statutory offence  In DPP v Taylor, DPP v Little,DPP v Taylor, DPP v Little [1992] 1 QB 645, 95 Cr App R 28 it was held that battery is a statutory offence, contrary to section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. This decision was criticised in Haystead v DPP where the Divisional court expressed the obiter opinion that battery remains a common law offence. Therefore, whilst it may be a better view that battery and assault have statutory penalties, rather than being statutory offences, it is still the case that until review by a higher court, DPP v Little is the preferred authority.  Mode of trial and sentence  In England and Wales, it is a usually tried as a summary offence under section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. However, where section 40 applies, it can be an additional charge on an indictment. It is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, or both. See the Crown Prosecution Service Sentencing Manual for case law on sentencing.  Russia  There is an offence which could be (loosely) described as battery in Russia. Article 116 of the Russian Criminal Code provides that battery or similar violent actions which cause pain are an offence.  Scotland  There is no distinct offence of battery in Scotland. The offence of assault includes acts that could be described as battery.  United States  In the United States, criminal battery, or simple battery, is the use of force against another, resulting in harmful or offensive contact, including sexual contact.Black's Law Dictionary Garner, p. 162 At common law, simple battery is a misdemeanor. The prosecutor must prove all three elements beyond a reasonable doubt: # an unlawful application of force # to the person of another # resulting in either bodily injury or an offensive touching. The common-law elements serve as a basic template, but individual jurisdictions may alter them, and they may vary slightly from state to state. Under modern statutory schemes, battery is often divided into grades that determine the severity of punishment. For example: * Simple battery may include any form of non-consensual harmful or insulting contact, regardless of the injury caused. Criminal battery requires intent to inflict an injury on another. * Sexual battery may be defined as non-consensual touching of the intimate parts of another. At least in Florida, \\"Sexual battery means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another or the anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object\\": See section 794.011. * Family-violence battery may be limited in its scope between persons within a certain degree of relationship: statutes for this offense have been enacted in response to increasing awareness of the problem of domestic violence. * Aggravated battery generally is seen as a serious offense of felony grade. Aggravated battery charges may occur when a battery causes serious bodily injury or permanent disfigurement. As successor to the common law crime of mayhem, this is sometimes subsumed in the definition of aggravated assault. In Florida, Aggravated Battery is the intentional infliction of great bodily harm and is a second degree felony, whereas battery that unintentionally causes great bodily harm is considered a third degree felony.  Kansas  In the state of Kansas, battery is defined as follows: :Battery. :(a) Battery is: :(1) Knowingly or recklessly causing bodily harm to another person; or :(2) knowingly causing physical contact with another person when done in a rude, insulting or angry manner.  Louisiana  The law on battery in Louisiana reads: :§ 33\\\\. Battery defined :Battery is the intentional use of force or violence upon the person of another; or the intentional administration of a poison or other noxious liquid or substance to another.  Jurisdictional differences  In some jurisdictions, battery has recently been constructed to include directing bodily secretions (i.e., spitting) at another person without their permission. Some of those jurisdictions automatically elevate such a battery to the charge of aggravated battery. In some jurisdictions, the charge of criminal battery also requires evidence of a mental state (mens rea). The terminology used to refer to a particular offense can also vary by jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions, such as New York, refer to what, under the common law, would be battery as assault, and then use another term for the crime that would have been assault, such as menacing.  Distinction between battery and assault  A typical overt behavior of an assault is Person A chasing Person B and swinging a fist toward their head. That for battery is A striking B. Battery requires: *a volitional act, that *results in a harmful or offensive contact with another person, and *is committed for the purpose of causing a harmful or offensive contact or under circumstances that render such contact substantially certain to occur or with a reckless disregard as to whether such contact will result. Assault, where rooted on English law, is an attempted battery or the act of intentionally placing a person in apprehension of a harmful or offensive contact with their person. Elsewhere it is often similarly worded as the threat of violence to a person while aggravated assault is the threat with the clear and present ability and willingness to carry it out. Aggravated battery is, typically, offensive touching without a tool or weapon with attempt to harm or restrain.

History The Union des Forces Progressistes (UFP) was formed in 2002 out of desire to unite Québec's leftists into a political party. Four parties merged to form the Union: * the Rassemblement pour l'alternative progressiste (RAP), * the Parti de la démocratie socialiste (PDS), formerly the New Democratic Party of Quebec * the Parti communiste du Québec (PCQ), and * the Québec-based membership of the International Socialists. On 5 November 2005, delegates of the UFP voted unanimously in favour of a merger with the party of the Option citoyenne movement led by Françoise David. The founding congress of the new party was held on 4 February 2006 and resulted in the formation of a new party, Québec solidaire. Principles and aims The aim of the UFP was to bring together progressive forces across the broad left wing of the political spectrum, including social democrats, socialists and communists. The UFP also advocated altermondialism, feminism, pacifism and green politics. Its platform did not specifically endorse social democracy, socialism, or communism. The Green Party of Quebec pledged to try to avoid running candidates in ridings where there was a UFP candidate, although it reserved the right to run anywhere it wants to (even ridings with a UFP candidate), and did not merge with the UFP. The UFP presented itself as an alternative to the main three parties in Québec: the centre-left Parti Québécois, the centre-right Quebec Liberal Party, and the conservative Action démocratique du Québec/Equipe Mario Dumont, saying that all three are but different faces of the same right-wing ideology called neoliberalism. The UFP opposed globalization, privatization, and deregulation, and called for increased funding of social services, higher taxes on the rich and business, proportional representation in the National Assembly of Quebec, and an alternative economy based upon co-operatives and nonprofit organizations. The UFP supported Québec sovereignty. It considered this option not as an end in itself, but rather as a means to achieve the party's social ideal for the people of Québec. To solve the national question, the UFP suggested the creation of a Constituent Assembly, mandated to draw up and propose to the population, via referendum, a Constitution for a progressive, republican, secular, and democratic Québec. The UFP was led by a council instead of a single leader. The UFP promised to be a party of the ballot box and of the streets, meaning that it would work to increase awareness of social problems and for progressive social change even between elections, particularly with regards to the rights of workers and of the unemployed. Considering its modest results in the 2003 elections (1.06% of the votes or 1.50% if the Green Party of Québec's votes were included), the UFP was a marginal party. UFP position on the national question From the Preamble of the UFP political platform, Building a world that reflects our ideals! : :UFP members share the view that the answer to the national question, and by extension social emancipation, is sovereignty for the Quebec people. The UFP believes that Quebec should become a country, free from the federalist yoke, and should acquire the essential tools it needs to develop as a nation.

A Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer in the force's distinctive dress uniform Mounted Tourist-Police officers in Petra, Jordan A police officer, also known as an officer, policeman, or a policewoman is a warranted law employee of a police force. In most countries, \\"police officer\\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank. In some, the use of the rank \\"officer\\" is legally reserved for military personnel. Police officers are generally charged with the apprehension of suspects and the prevention, detection, and reporting of crime, protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an oath, and have the power to arrest people and detain them for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some officers are trained in special duties, such as counter-terrorism, surveillance, child protection, VIP protection, civil law enforcement, and investigation techniques into major crime including fraud, rape, murder, and drug trafficking. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to pass themselves off as civilians. In most countries police officers are given exemptions from certain laws to perform their duties. For example an officer may use force if necessary to arrest or detain a person when it would ordinarily be assault. In some countries, officers can also break road rules to perform their duties.  Etymology  The word \\"police\\" comes from the Greek , meaning government, which came to mean its civil administration. The more general term for the function is law enforcement officer or peace officer. A sheriff is typically the top police officer of a county, with that word coming from the person enforcing law over a shire. A person who has been deputized to serve the function of the sheriff is referred to as the deputy. Police officers are those empowered by government to enforce the laws it creates. In The Federalist collection of articles and essays, James Madison wrote: \\"If men were angels, no Government would be necessary\\". These words apply to those who serve government, including police. A common nickname for a police officer is \\"cop\\"; derived from the verb sense \\"to arrest\\", itself derived from \\"to grab\\". Thus, \\"someone who captures\\", a \\"copper\\", was shortened to just \\"cop\\". It may also find its origin in the Latin , brought to English via the Old French . Duties and functions Responsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another. Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts, restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, rules and procedures dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty. In the majority of Western legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to discourage crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to emergency calls, along with routine community policing. Police are often used as an emergency service and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, disasters, search and rescue situations, and road traffic collisions. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with fire and emergency medical services. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of fire police). In many countries, there is a common emergency service number that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom have outlined command procedures, for the use in major emergencies or disorder. The Gold Silver Bronze command structure is a system set up to improve communications between ground-based officers and the control room, typically, Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an 'Incident Control Room' erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander who would be in the Control Room. Police are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing citations which typically may result in the imposition of fines, particularly for violations of traffic law. Traffic enforcement is often and effectively accomplished by police officers on motorcycles—called motor officers, these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply motors. Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose car has broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic first aid such as CPR. Some park rangers are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within national parks and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas Military police perform law enforcement functions within the military. Entry and promotion qualifications In most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education. Increasing numbers of people are joining the police force who possess tertiary education and in response to this many police forces have developed a \\"fast-track\\" scheme whereby those with university degrees spend two to three years as a Constable before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as Sergeants or Inspectors. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.) Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States state laws may codify statewide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training but in other places requirements are set by local police agencies. Each local Police agency has different requirements. Polizia Municipale from Piacenza, Italy Promotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in salary, it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma attached to this, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded. Dependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may apply for specialist positions, such as detective, police dog handler, mounted police officer, motorcycle officer, water police officer, or firearms officer (in countries where police are not routinely armed). In some countries, including Singapore, police ranks are supplemented through conscription, similar to national service in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. Conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but minimum academic qualification requirements are less stringent. Some join as volunteers, again via differing qualification requirements. Pay In some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they have served. In the United States, an average police officer's salary is between $53,561 and $64,581 in 2020. In the United Kingdom for the year 2015–16 a police officer's average salary was £30,901.  Occupational safety and health  There are numerous issues affecting the safety and health of police officers, including line of duty deaths and occupational stress. On August 6, 2019, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal announced creation of the first U.S. statewide program to support the mental health of police officers. The goal of the program would be to train officers in emotional resiliency and to help destigmatize mental health issues.  Application of force  Individual cases Almost universally, police officers are authorized the use of force, up to and including deadly force, when acting in a law enforcement capacity. Although most law enforcement agencies follow some variant of the use of force continuum, where officers are only authorized the level of force required to match situational requirements, specific thresholds and responses vary between jurisdictions. While officers are trained to avoid excessive use of force, and may be held legally accountable for infractions, the variability of law enforcement and its dependence on human judgment have made the subject an area of controversy and research. Accountability In the performance of their duties, police officers may act unlawfully, either deliberately or as a result of errors in judgment. Police accountability efforts strive to protect citizens and their rights by ensuring legal and effective law enforcement conduct, while affording individual officers the required autonomy, protection, and discretion. As an example, the use of body-worn cameras has been shown to reduce both instances of misconduct and complaints against officers.

It has various lodges, chapters and other affiliated bodies throughout the globe, operating in 19 different languages. AMORC claims an association with a \\"perennial philosophy\\", often referred to as \\"The Primordial Tradition\\". The Order further states that it is heir and custodian of the \\"Rose-Croix\\" of the past, thereby making it the oldest existing Traditional Fraternity and a modern-day manifestation of the 'Rosicrucian Fraternity' of old, which is believed by some to have originated in the traditions of the Ancient Egyptian Mystery schools. The ancient Mysteries are said to have been preserved through the millennia by closed secret societies until the early years of 17th Century Europe. At that point, according to AMORC internal mythology, the time was right for the existence of this body of secret knowledge to become open, i.e. revealed, to the world, in the form of the Rosicrucian manifestos. Famous seventeenth century Rosicrucian Michael Maier described the origins of Rosicrucianism as \\"Egyptian, Brahmanic, derived from the Mysteries of Eleusis and Samothrace, the Magi of Persia, the Pythagoreans, and the Arabs.\\" Several of his other works also allude to the mysterious origins of the Rosicrucians. Today, AMORC is regarded as representing an \\"open cycle\\" of the ancient Rosicrucian tradition, its existence being a \\"reactivation\\" of Rosicrucian teaching in the United States, with previous Rosicrucian colonies in the United States having become dormant. AMORC presents itself as a worldwide philosophical and humanistic, non-sectarian and apolitical fraternal order devoted to \\"the study of the elusive mysteries of life and the universe.\\" It is also open to both men and women of legal adult age (18 years old in most countries) regardless of their various religious persuasions.  Name  The name AMORC is an abbreviation of the Latin title Antiquus Mysticusque Ordo Rosæ Crucis (\\"Ancient and Mystic Order of the Rosy Cross\\" – \\"Antiquus Arcanus Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis\\"). Harvey Spencer Lewis, author and mystic who re-activated AMORC in the United States of America, wrote that \\"from the very start, and with the issuance of the first public manifesto, the correct name of the international Rosicrucian organization was used, namely, the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis. This is a slightly abbreviated form of the original Latin name, Antiquus Arcanus Ordo Rosae Rubeae et Aureae Crucis, and the initials AMORC were immediately used, as well as the true and original symbol of the Rosicrucian Order – the golden cross with but one red rose in the center\\".Lewis, H. Spencer Rosicrucian Questions and Answers with Complete History of the Rosicrucian Order, pp. 180–181, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1929, AMORC holds legal rights to the above-mentioned titles including the title \\"Rosicrucian Order”. Teachings AMORC's teachings cover what may be termed the \\"Sacred Sciences\\" and include ideas based on the major philosophers, particularly Pythagoras, Thales, Solon, Heraclitus, Democritus. The teachings are divided into \\"Degrees\\" which are further grouped into broad categories under titles such as Postulant, Neophyte, and Initiate sections. These degrees cover various fields related to physical, mental, psychic, and spiritual existence such as physics, metaphysics, biology, psychology, parapsychology, comparative religion, traditional healing techniques, health, intuition, extrasensory perception, material and spiritual alchemy, meditation, sacred architecture, symbolism, and that mystical state of consciousness relating to the experience of unity with the Divine.According to AMORC's publication Mastery of Life Organization and structure AMORC is a worldwide organization, established in the United States as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) public benefit corporation, with the specific and primary purpose of advancing the knowledge of its history, principles, and teachings for charitable, educational, and scientific purposes. It is financed mainly through fees paid by its members. Income is used by the organization to pay expenses, develop new programs, expand services, and carry out educational work. AMORC is governed by the Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC which is composed of the Imperator, and the Board of Directors which is further composed of the Grand Masters of the Grand Lodges and related executive officers, and meets annually, often in Lachute, Quebec, Canada (however, in August 2009 the Supreme Board met in Toulouse, France, in honor of the 100th Anniversary of H. Spencer Lewis's initiation there) and more recently in Rome, Italy. It is responsible for the worldwide coordination of AMORC, the establishment of new administrations, and the appointment of jurisdictions to Grand Lodges, usually based on language. Each AMORC Grand Lodge has its own headquarters and facilities. The headquarters of the English Grand Lodge for the Americas owns the Rosicrucian Park in San Jose, California, founded in 1927, which includes the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, the fifth planetarium built in the USA (and the first to have a US-built star projector, built by Dr. Harvey Spencer Lewis), the Rosicrucian Peace Garden, Rosicrucian Research Library, Grand Temple, Administration Building, Fountain Plaza and Gardens, the Alchemy Garden and the walking Labyrinth.

These various titles differ according to the number of members of each body in regular attendance. Participation in these groups is optional, and participants retain compulsory membership with their respective Grand Lodge. Many of these groups charge additional dues to participants to cover expenses such as rent, utility and maintenance costs. Most affiliated bodies of the AMORC offer Open Meetings or Lectures to which the general public is invited and welcome. Discussion groups, an informal type of gathering for both members and the public, were formally introduced in 2009 in North America. They are authorized by AMORC but are not affiliated bodies. History Francis Bacon, claimed by AMORC to have been an Imperator of the Rosicrucian Order According to AMORC's internal history, in 1909 Harvey Spencer Lewis visited France in search of Rosicrucians, was initiated in Toulouse, France, and given the mandate to establish an order in North America. After further qualification and preparation, the first official Manifesto was issued in the United States in 1915, announcing the establishment of Rosicrucian activity in America. May Banks-Stacy, the co- founder of AMORC, was said to be one of the last successors to the original colony of Rosicrucians who settled in America during the late 17th century, and an initiate of the Rosicrucians of the East.Christian Rebisse, pp.161–163. Lewis became a \\"secret partner\\" of Big Business in America.H. Spencer Lewis Rosicrucian Principles for Home and Business, p. 15, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1953 ASIN: B000O3PY9K; 1st ed. 1929 According to railroad magnate Arthur Stilwell, no other man has exerted a greater influence as a secret partner in American free enterprise than Lewis. Walt Disney was once a member of AMORC as was Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and many other well-known individuals who prefer to remain anonymous.Erik Davis The Visionary State, p. 112, Chronicle Books, 2006 AMORC headquarters were located in New York City, San Francisco, and Tampa, Florida, before moving to San Jose, California, in 1927. Harvey Spencer Lewis died in 1939 and, in accordance with wishes stipulated in his will, was succeeded in the Office of Imperator by his son Ralph Maxwell Lewis, who had previously served as Supreme Secretary. Upon Lewis' death in 1987, Gary L. Stewart, who previously served as Grand Master of the English-Speaking jurisdiction and then Vice President of AMORC's Board of Directors, was appointed by the Board, which forms the Supreme Grand Lodge, to the Office of Imperator. In 1990, Christian Bernard, who had been the Grand Master of France, and then succeeded Stewart to the position of Vice President of the Board, was elected by the Board to the Office of Imperator. During World War II, AMORC underwent a dramatic period of growth. After the war ended AMORC was able to lend support to its European sister organizations. Eventually many of those came under the administration of AMORC's leadership in San Jose. 2009, the centennial year of H. Spencer Lewis's initiation in Toulouse, saw growth in membership in the English Grand Lodge for the Americas and very active participation in on-line activities including Facebook, Twitter, online discussion groups, a social networking site, podcasts and Rosicrucian TV on YouTube. Rosicrucian Park in San Jose received many improvements as well, including the completion of accessibility upgrades to the museum, planetarium and grounds, and the installation of sustainable native plant gardens. AMORC uses \\"traditional\\" history, consisting of tales and legends represented as having been passed down for centuries by word of mouth, as well as the conventional \\"chronological\\" history, which consists of verifiable fact. According to its traditional history, AMORC traces its origin to Mystery Schools established in Egypt during the joint reign of Pharaoh Thutmose III and Hatshepsut, about 1500 BCE.Armstrong, Steven, \\"Hidden Harmonies: Rediscovering the Egyptian Foundations of the Rosicrucian Path,\\" Rosicrucian Digest Volume 85 Number 1 2007, 47–50 at rackcdn.com They united the priesthoods of Egypt into a single order under the leadership of Hatshepsut's Vizier, Hapuseneb.James H. Breasted, Ancient Records of Egypt, Vol 2, The Eighteenth Dynasty (1906; repr., New York: Russell and Russell, 1962), 160–162 Each Temple had its associated Per Ankh (House of Life) where the Mysteries were handed down.Garth Fowden, The Egyptian Hermes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993), 57. In uniting the priesthoods, the Per Ankhu were also united. Those schools were formed to probe into \\"the mysteries of life\\" – in other words, natural phenomena, and initiatic spirituality.See Jeremy Naydler, Shamanic Wisdom of the Pyramid Texts (Rochester VT: Inner Traditions, 2005). AMORC also claims that among their most esteemed pupils were Pharaoh Akhenaten (Amenhotep IV) and his wife Nefertiti. Over centuries, the Mystery Schools spread into Greece and thence into Rome. During the Middle Ages, they were allegedly concealed under various names. AMORC claims that Rosicrucianism is mentioned as far back as 1115 CE in a book of the collection of Brother Omnis Moriar in Germany. However, no other record of such a brother or book has appeared. The alleged name probably derives from the opening words of Horace in Ode 3.30, in which he writes: \\"Non Omnis Moriar\\" (\\"I shall not completely die\\"). Jakob Böhme, claimed by AMORC to have been a Rosicrucian Rosicrucianism rose to considerable prominence in Europe during the 17th century following the publication and wide circulation of a small pamphlet, the Fama Fraternitatis. AMORC scholars have suggested that Rosicrucians first went to America in the area of present-day Carmel-by-the-Sea, California in The Vizcaíno Expedition of 1602–1603. The next Rosicrucian expedition to America is said to have been by the chartered vessel Sarah Maria during the early months of 1694, under the leadership of Grand Master Johannes Kelpius, and a colony was established in what is now Fairmount Park, Philadelphia.Julius Friedrich Sachse The German Pietists of Provincial Pennsylvania, Self-Publishing, 1895 ASIN: B000GTCOVI They finally settled on the banks of the Wissahickon. \\"In that retired valley beside the flowing brook the secret rites and mysteries of the true Rosicrucian Philosophy flourished unmolested for years, until the state of affairs brought about by the American Revolution, together with pernicious Sunday legislation which also discriminated against the keepers of the scriptural Sabbath day, gradually caused the incoming generation to assimilate with the secular congregations.\\"Sachse pp. 7–8 That is disputed by another organization, the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross, at one time headed by Dr. R. Swinburne Clymer. Johannes Kelpius, of the Jacob Boehme Lodge in Germany, allegedly led the German Pietists to America, although no historical evidence exists to support that claim, nor the common claim to be connected to the Ephrata Cloister.H. Spencer Lewis Rosicrucian Manual, p. 16, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1982 ; 1st ed. 1918 The two rival organizations have long disputed each other's claims to Rosicrucian genuineness.Clymer's side of the argument is found in R. Swinburne Clymer The Rosicrucian Fraternity in America, v. 1 & v. 2, The Rosicrucian Foundation, 1935 ASIN: B000KY2K8G. H. Spencer Lewis discusses the disputes in H. Spencer Lewis, Rosicrucian Questions and Answers With Complete History of the Rosicrucian Order (San Jose: Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1929), 151–159; 204–206. Recent scholarship on the dispute may be found in Christopher McIntosh, The Rosicrucians (3rd Rev. Ed.) (Boston: Weiser Books, 1997), 119–132 and Christian Rebisse, Rosicrucian History and Mysteries (San Jose: English Grand Lodge, 2005), 223 n. 31. Leadership and new groups From 1915 to 1990, the leadership of AMORC was entrusted to the Office of an Imperator, who was solely responsible for all doctrine and ritual of the Order, as well as a corporate president who sat at the head of the board of directors, which was responsible for determining all corporate matters related to the organization. When AMORC reorganized in April, 1990, the dual function of the Office was merged into one position, that of President of the worldwide AMORC organization. However, internally, the President was still referred to by the traditional title of Imperator. In addition to the Imperator, each Grand Lodge has a Grand Master. In 1990, there was a dispute over the leadership of the AMORC, which was then under the leadership of Imperator Gary L. Stewart. It was prompted by allegations made by members of the Board of Directors of embezzlement on the part of Stewart. In April, 1990, a lawsuit was filed by the Board and, as a result of the allegations, a Temporary Restraining Order kept Stewart from returning to AMORC's properties until the trial. The newly-expanded Board of Directors voted that the Vice President of the Board of Directors, Christian Bernard, should assume Stewart's offices. An installation ritual was held at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco, California. During the next three years there was little progress regarding the lawsuit. Eventually, the new AMORC Board of Directors sought to settle out of court, due to the ongoing financial strain of legal costs. On 10 August 1993, AMORC dismissed their case against Stewart with prejudice. The dismissal was the final severing of the relationship between Stewart and AMORC. The governance of AMORC is now overseen by the Supreme Grand Lodge (the Imperator, Grand Masters and Administrators), with local (geographic and/or language- based) Grand Lodges throughout the world. Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of the French, claimed by AMORC to have been worn when he served as Master of a Rosicrucian Order jurisdiction based in Paris.181x181px After his removal from AMORC in 1990, former Imperator Stewart founded the Confraternity of the Rose Cross, and used the original version of H. Spencer Lewis' monographs, with addenda added by Stewart, as well as additional monographs written by Stewart (as opposed to the monographs currently used by AMORC, which were initially rewritten in large parts under Imperator Bernard's supervision, and are now regularly revised and updated, according to AMORC traditional custom dating from the time of H. Spencer Lewis's first published materials in 1916Multiple versions of the published materials from the earliest printed materials in the American Rosae Crucis (1916, seq) and Cromaat (1918) publications to the formal monographs in many later editions over the years may be found in the collection of the Rosicrucian Research Library, and the Publications Department at Rosicrucian Park in San Jose.). Stewart also founded the Order Militia Crucifera Evangelica and assisted with the formation of the British Martinist Order. Other organizations using the name Rosicrucian which formed after Stewart's removal from AMORC include the Ghanaian Order of the Rose Cross led by Benjamin Quaye, and the Norwegian Order of the Rose Cross led by Robert Aarberg, which are closely allied with Stewart's Confraternity of the Rose Cross, and the short-lived Ancient Rosae Crucis, which was led by Ashley McFadden. Diego Rivera as member A well-known member of AMORC was Mexican muralist painter Diego Rivera. The association has puzzled art historians, as Rivera was a staunch adherent of Marxism. In 1926, Rivera was among the founders of AMORC's Mexico City lodge, called Quetzalcoatl, and painted an image of Quetzalcoatl for the local temple.Raquel Tibol, \\"Apareció la serpiente: Diego Rivera y los rosacruces,\\" Proceso 701 (9 April 1990), pp. 50-53. In 1954, when he tried to be readmitted into the Mexican Communist Party from which he had been excluded because of his support of Leon Trotsky, Rivera had to justify his AMORC activities, which looked strange for a Marxist. Rivera answered that, by joining AMORC, he wanted to infiltrate a typical \\"Yankee\\" organization on behalf of Communism. However, he also claimed that AMORC was \\"essentially materialist, insofar as it only admits different states of energy and matter, and is based on ancient Egyptian occult knowledge from Amenhotep IV and Nefertiti.\\"Diego Rivera, Arte y política, México: Grijalbo, 1979, p. 354. . Public activities Many of the activities of the Rosicrucian Order AMORC are open to the public, as well as members. These include: * Online Classes: In the fall of 2006, the English Grand Lodge for the Americas began offering free online classes in many subjects. Most of these Rose+Croix University Online Classes are open to both AMORC members and the public. These are conducted today on Facebook. * Open Classes: These are held in many locations, including in North America and the Caribbean, and are listed on the AMORC English Grand Lodge for the Americas site in the external links below. Other such public activities can be found on the international sites. * Meditation for Peace: In 2004, Imperator Christian Bernard proclaimed the annual Rosicrucian Meditation for Peace Ceremony at the Rosicrucian World Peace Conference (see below). This is held at the Grand Lodge and in affiliated bodies throughout the world on the fourth Sunday of June each year. North American and Caribbean locations are listed on the AMORC English Grand Lodge for the Americas site. * Autumn Equinox Memorial Ceremony: The annual Memorial Ceremony is held at the Grand Lodge in San Jose and in affiliated bodies throughout the world at the Autumn Equinox each year. North American and Caribbean locations are listed on the AMORC English Grand Lodge for the Americas site. * Council of Solace Ritual: The Imperator and Supreme Board of AMORC recently opened the Council of Solace Ritual, welcoming both members and the public to participate. In North America and the Caribbean, this meditation ceremony is held at the Grand Lodge headquarters in San Jose, and in most Grand Lodges worldwide. AMORC often organizes various conferences around the world, increasingly having many sessions open to the public, and several councils of experts on various topics. In August 2001 the world convention took place in Gothenburg, Sweden. The main theme of the convention was world peace and harmony. The convention was of significant importance to Rosicrucian history because Imperator Bernard presented the \\"Positio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis\\" to inform the public about AMORC's position on the current world situation. A subsequent manifesto, the \\"Appellatio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis\\"was issued in 2014 as a call to action on these themes. In July 2004 The Rosicrucian World Peace Conference was held in San Jose. Over 2000 Rosicrucians from 70 countries gathered with Imperator Christian Bernard, and North American Grand Master Julie Scott. The Imperator dedicated the Rosicrucian Park's Rosicrucian Peace Garden, designed according to examples from Egypt's 18th Dynasty by Grand Master Emeritus of the English Grand Lodge for Australia, New Zealand and Asia, Peter Bindon. The World Convention for 2007 was held in Berlin, Germany with the theme \\"Love Will Build the Bridge.\\" All of the events, except for the ritualistic convocations, were open to the Public. Curitiba, Brazil, the headquarters of the Portuguese Grand Lodge of AMORC, hosted the August 2011 World Convention: The Sacred and the Primordial Tradition. The World Convention in 2015 was again held in San Jose CA USA celebrating the 100th Anniversary of AMORC's founding in America in 1915. During the latest World Convention, held in Rome, Italy, in August 2019, a new Imperator was elected, namely the Italian Grand Master Claudio Mazzucco. The International Research Council is a group of AMORC members who have expertise in several areas, including physics, biology, philosophy and music. According to the AMORC, the members of the International Research Council dedicate themselves to the advancement of their profession for the benefit of humanity. The Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum launched a substantial new exhibit on Spiritual and Physical Alchemy on the Spring Equinox 2015. The Rosicrucian Order hosted an academic conference for Scholars and Practitioners of Esotericism at Rosicrucian Park, 22–25 July 2010. The theme for the papers and presentations given by members of many different esoteric groups was the influence of esoteric Orders on the modern world. Several of the papers were to be published in the June 2011 Rose Croix Journal. The Council of Solace is a group of Rosicrucians who meditate and direct spiritual force for health and harmony daily on behalf of others. They offer free, 24-hour metaphysical aid to those in need, regardless of membership. Members and the public may by invitation take part in the Council of Solace meditation ritual held in various locations. The AMORC publishes several publications including a public magazine called the Rosicrucian Digest, an online academic periodical called the Rose-Croix Journal, as well as books which focus on topics such as metaphysics, mysticism, and Egyptology. Rosicrucian Digest The Rosicrucian Digest was first published in 1915 under the name American Rosae Crucis, and then The Triangle, The Mystic Triangle and finally The Rosicrucian Digest. It has been adapted to serve the needs of each period. Beginning with the December 2006 issue (Vol 84:2) the Digest began a series of multimedia thematic issues available online and in print twice a year. The first such issue (December 2006) dealt with Atlantis, while the 2007 volumes covered Ancient Egypt and The Essenes. 2008 issues followed with The Orphic Mysteries and the Delphi, while 2009 issues covered The Pythagoreans and the Eleusinian Mysteries and other Timeline topics through 2014. In the United Kingdom the public magazine is named Rosicrucian Beacon and is published quarterly by the \\"English speaking jurisdiction for Europe, Africa and the Middle East of the Rosicrucian Order AMORC.\\" In Australasia the magazine is titled The Rosicrucian. Other AMORC jurisdictions have similar publications. Rose+Croix Journal AMORC's Rose+Croix Journal is \\"an international, interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary, peer-reviewed online journal that focuses on topics that relate to the sciences, history, the arts, mysticism, and spirituality, especially interdisciplinary topics and transdisciplinary inquiries that traverse and lie beyond the limits of different fields of study. These topics may relate to any of the arts and sciences and/or to other emerging fields of human endeavor\\" (from the Rose+Croix Journal http://www.rosecroixjournal.org). The Journal's Website also has a Resources section with the five Rosicrucian Manifestos, Secret Symbols of the Rosicrucians, Rosicrucian Documents, online editions of the Rosicrucian Digest, etc. Submissions are solicited from members and the public. Multimedia and web presence According to AMORC tradition, H. Spencer Lewis received the mandate from the Rosicrucians of Toulouse when he was initiated in 1909 to make the tradition available and comprehensible to modern women and men.Christian Rebisse, 161–180. In accord with this, H. Spencer Lewis, and after him Ralph M. Lewis, used all of the technologies available to them to accomplish their work. An example was the radio station H. Spencer Lewis had broadcasting from his office at the Rosicrucian Park, and before that, at the previous headquarters in Tampa, and San Francisco. The broadcasting from San Jose began on 15 February 1928 and was delivered by two 30-metre radio towers inside the park. The radio towers have since been removed, though for some time AMORC continued to broadcast through the historic San Jose KEEN radio station. Today, the Order communicates using newer media: * Websites for all of the international jurisdictions of AMORC now provide instant access to information and resources for members and the public. * The English Grand Lodge for the Americas began a series of public podcasts in 2006 and launched Rosicrucian TV on YouTube in 2009. Topics range include mysticism, Egyptology, peace, esotericism and other subjects. * English Grand Lodge for the Americas members enjoy a private community social networking forum based in the Ning system. * Facebook has rapidly become a major forum for North American AMORC, with over 300,000 likes for its main Facebook page as of October 2013. There are also fan pages for Rosicrucian Park, the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum, Rose+Croix University Online Classes (including discussions of each issue of the new Rosicrucian Digests), the new Alchemy Exhibit at the Museum, and the Hidden in Plain Sight Conference. * Twitter followers receive frequent updates from the Order, the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum and the Rosicrucian Research Library. The public presence of the Rosicrucians in Western Europe was made known through the publication of three manifestos. AMORC introduced a fourth manifesto, the Positio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis at an AMORC convention in Sweden in August 2001. The Positio offers AMORC's observations on problems in the modern world, along with proposed solutions. The Positio closes with an invocation that expresses what it calls \\"Rosicrucian Utopia\\": A subsequent manifesto, the \\"Appellatio Fraternitatis Rosæ Crucis\\", was issued in 2014 as a call to action on these themes. > God of all beings, God of all life, In the humanity we are dreaming of: * > Politicians are profoundly humanistic and strive to serve the common good; * > Economists manage state finances with discernment and in the interest of > all; * Scientists are spiritualistic and seek their inspiration in the Book > of Nature; * Artists are inspired and express the beauty and purity of the > Divine Plan in their works; * Physicians are motivated by love for their > fellow-beings and treat both the soul and the body; * Misery and poverty > have vanished, for everyone has what one needs to live happily; * Work is > not regarded as a chore; it is looked at as a source of growth and well- > being; * Nature is considered to be the most beautiful temple of all, and > animals are considered to be our brothers and sisters on the path of > evolution; * A World Government composed of the leaders of all nations, > working in the interest of all humanity, has come into existence. * > Spirituality is an ideal and a way of life, which springs forth from a > Universal Religion, founded more upon the knowledge of divine laws than upon > the belief in God; * Human relations are founded upon love, friendship, and > community, so that the whole world lives in peace and harmony.  Honors   Frater Rosae Crucis  AMORC awards the titles Frater Rosae Crucis and Soror Rosae Crucis to members initiated into the 10th Degree of the order. These members are considered to have attained a master level of understanding of the society's teachings. Awardees may use the post-nominal letters F.R.C. or S.R.C.

It was also available for NCR's third generation NCR Century series as the NCR/653-100. A CRAM cartridge contained 256 3x14 inch cards with a PET film magnetic recording surface. Each \\"deck\\" of cards could contain up to 5.5 MB of alphanumeric characters. The cards were suspended from eight d-section rods, which were selectively rotated to release a specific card, each card having a unique pattern of notches at one end. The selected card was dropped and wrapped around a rotating drum to be read or written. Each cartridge could store 5.5 MB. Later versions of the CRAM, the 353-2 and 353-3, used decks of 512 cards, thus doubling the storage capacity of each unit. Each card contains seven tracks containing 1550 slabs (12 bits each). Normally the track was initialized with a four slab header containing the cartridge number (two slabs), the card number and the track number. Cards were dropped by changing the card rods to a binary configuration and release the two outside \\"release\\" rods. Air was blown over the top of the cards to keep them separated, and to increase the dropping speed. Once on the rotating \\"drum\\" a series of positive and negative air pressure chambers pulled the card across a magnetic read-write head. After one or more passes over the head, where data is written to or read from the card, a release gate allow the card to be \\"thrown\\" along a raceway over the card deck, and onto a \\"loader\\" mechanism. The loader used a group of electro-magnetic solenoids to slam the card back onto the control rods. The unit was a monster with two large electric motors that drove four large vacuum/blowers. It was possible to have up to five cards in motion at any point in time; one dropping, one on the drum, two in the return transport, and one being loaded back onto the deck. If the card didn't succeed in dropping there was a \\"magic wand\\" similar to a pencil available to solve the problem. One feature of this device was the potential for a \\"double drop\\", where two cards would drop at once, due to a break in a notch on one card, or, more commonly, a card being held by one rod being dislodged by the adjacent card dropping, usually cards 000 (the deck directory card) and 001 which resulted in the necessity of recreating the directory. This would result in a high pitched noise with which operators were very familiar and could hear even outside the computer room, and damage to the cards. These were called \\"screamers\\", while the opposite problem, cards that wouldn't drop, were called \\"hangers\\". Another interesting feature was that, should an operator accidentally drop all the cards from a cartridge, they could be replaced without worrying about order. The order of the cards was not important because of the notch encoding system. The first CRAM units were deployed on NCR's 315 system. A second generation was deployed on the successor 615 or Century line of computers. Ed Scott wrote the CRAM software for the Century line of computers. CRAM was very successful in the 1960s, offering a fast and secure storage alternative to magnetic tape, but was superseded by the development of superior disk drive technology.

He invented the equals sign (=) and also introduced the pre-existing plus sign (+) to English speakers in 1557. Biography Born around 1512, Robert Recorde was the second son of Thomas and Rose Recorde of Tenby, Pembrokeshire, in Wales. Recorde entered the University of Oxford about 1525, and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College there in 1531. Having adopted medicine as a profession, he went to the University of Cambridge to take the degree of M.D. in 1545. He afterwards returned to Oxford, where he publicly taught mathematics, as he had done prior to going to Cambridge. It appears that he afterwards went to London, and acted as physician to King Edward VI and to Queen Mary, to whom some of his books are dedicated. He was also controller of the Royal Mint and served as Comptroller of Mines and Monies in Ireland. After being sued for defamation by a political enemy, he was arrested for debt and died in the King's Bench Prison, Southwark, by the middle of June 1558.

Recorde's introduction of \\"=\\" Recorde published several works upon mathematical and medical subjects, chiefly in the form of dialogue between master and scholar, such as the following: *The Grounde of Artes, teachings the Worke and Practise, of Arithmeticke, both in whole numbers and fractions (1543), the first English language book on algebra. *The Pathway to Knowledge, containing the First Principles of Geometry ... bothe for the use of Instrumentes Geometricall and Astronomicall, and also for Projection of Plattes (London, 1551) *The Castle of Knowledge, containing the Explication of the Sphere both Celestiall and Materiall, etc. (London, 1556) A book explaining Ptolemaic astronomy while mentioning the Copernican heliocentric model in passing. *The Whetstone of Witte, whiche is the seconde parte of Arithmeteke: containing the extraction of rootes; the cossike practise, with the rule of equation; and the workes of Surde Nombers (London, 1557). This was the book in which the equals sign was introduced. With the publication of this book Recorde is credited with introducing algebra into the Island of Britain with a systematic notation.Robert Recorde, The Whetstone of Witte (London, England: John Kyngstone, 1557), p. 236 (although the pages of this book are not numbered). From the chapter titled \\"The rule of equation, commonly called Algebers Rule\\" (p. 236): \\"Howbeit, for easie alteration of equations. I will propounde a fewe examples, bicause the extraction of their rootes, maie the more aptly bee wroughte.

And to avoid the tedious repetition of these words \\"is equal to\\", I will substitute, as I often do when working, a pair of parallels or twin lines of the same length, thus: = , because no two things can be more equal.) * A medical work, The Urinal of Physick (1548), frequently reprinted.The Urinal of Physick, by Robert Recorde, 1548; at Google Books Several books whose authors are unknown have been attributed to him: Cosmographiae isagoge, De Arte faciendi Horologium and De Usu Globorum et de Statu temporum.John Hall, \\"An Historiall Expostulation\\", p. 60.

Crankshaft angle four stroke Straight-three engine with firing order 1-3-2 Straight-three engines generally employ a crank angle of 120°. This gives perfect first and second order balance on reciprocating mass, but an end-to- end rocking motion is induced because there is no symmetry in the piston velocities about the middle piston. The use of a balance shaft reduces this undesirable effect. An inline three-cylinder engine with 180° crankshaft can be found in early examples of the Laverda Jota motorcycle made by Italian manufacturer Laverda. In these engines, the outer pistons rise and fall together like a 360° straight-two engine. The inner cylinder is offset 180° from the outer cylinders. In these engines, cylinder number one fires, then 180° later cylinder number two fires, and then 180° later cylinder number three fires. There is no power stroke on the final 180° of rotation. This unusual crank angle came to be due to lack of proper tooling at the factory, which also made vertical twin engines that utilized a 180° crankshaft. After 1982, this engine had the regular 120° crank angle. Triumph's 2020 Tiger 900 has been developed with a so-called \\"T-Plane\\" big-bang firing order engine. This design has crank throws at 90° intervals, such that the throws for cylinders 1 and 3 are separated by 180° - the three throws together forming a \\"T\\" shape when viewed from the end. Triumph claim this configuration improves engine character and sound, as well as off-road feel and \\"rider connection to the rear wheel\\". Firing intervals are 180-270-270 crank degrees. Automobile use A tuned version of a Saab inline-three-cylinder two-stroke engine Suzuki K10B The smallest inline-three, four-stroke automobile engine was the Suzuki F5A, which was first used in the 1979 Suzuki Alto/Fronte. The 1967 Suzuki Fronte featured a two-stroke I3 engine. Smart currently produces a diminutive inline-three diesel engine. Most inline-three engines fall below 1.2 litres. A diesel engine was produced by VM Motori for the 1984 Alfa Romeo 33 1.8 TD, the largest inline-three produced for automotive use. Detroit Diesel Series 71 and Series 53 engines were available in 3 cylinder form for trucks and farm tractors. Basic versions of the Suzuki Swift (and its related badge-engineered versions) used a 993 cc inline-three-cylinder engine, with single-point injection. The same engine was also used in the Suzuki Wagon R+, with multi- point injection. This was replaced from 2003, with an Opel-sourced 998 cc unit, with four valves per cylinder and variable-length intake manifold, also used on the similar Opel Agila and the third generation of the Opel Corsa, and later on the Suzuki Splash and the fifth generation of the Opel Corsa. The Opel models previously used a 973 cc engine, which was initially featured on the second generation of the Opel Corsa. Some Daihatsu cars use straight-three engines. The Charade and the Mira/Cuore uses this engine type. Three-cylinder 1.0-litre diesel and turbodiesel engines were also offered in Daihatsu Charades. Korean cars Daewoo Tico, based on the 1988 Suzuki Alto, and later base versions of Daewoo Matiz also used inline-three S-TEC petrol engine. The Volkswagen Group is known for using three-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, in the Audi A2, Volkswagen Polo, Volkswagen Up!, Volkswagen Fox, Volkswagen Lupo, SEAT Ibiza, SEAT Córdoba, SEAT Mii, Škoda Citigo and Škoda Fabia. These engines range from 1.2-litre petrol, with four valves per cylinder, that delivers , to 1.4 TDI diesel, that delivers and has turbocharger with variable vane geometry. The most innovative three-cylinder engine the Volkswagen Group released was the 1.2 TDI diesel (launched in 1998), that was one of the first all-aluminium diesel engines and at the time of release was the lightest and most economic engine in production. It was used in the \\"3L\\" versions (from its diminutive fuel consumption of ) of the Audi A2 and the Volkswagen Lupo. Another three-cylinder engine is the 1.2 TDI diesel launched with the fifth generation of Volkswagen Polo (in 2009), that uses common rail injection (unlike the previous 1.2 TDI engine, which used unit injectors). Subaru used a straight-three engine in the Subaru Justy, and the export version of the Subaru Sambar, called the Subaru Sumo, which had their Subaru EF engine. Mitsubishi has made extensive use of three-cylinder engines, which have also been used in the Smart ForTwo, since 2004 on the Mitsubishi Colt, and from 2012 on the Mitsubishi Mirage. A three-cylinder diesel engine was also used on the Mitsubishi Colt and the Smart Forfour. This three-cylinder diesel engine, the Mercedes-Benz OM639, was the world's most powerful three-cylinder passenger car diesel engine at its creation, with 70kW (94 hp). In the 1950s and 1960s, the Saab 93, Saab 95, Saab 96, and certain DKW automobiles were powered by inline-three-cylinder, two-stroke engines. Also, the Wartburg automobiles manufactured in Eastern Germany, and FSO Syrena manufactured in Poland, used this kind of engine. The first generation Honda Insight (2000–2006) used a 1.0-litre inline-three engine in conjunction with an electric motor in its hybrid system. The Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) joint venture is using a common 996 cc inline-three-cylinder engine in models of the Aygo, 107 and C1 respectively, which is derived from Daihatsu. The same engine has been provided for the Toyota Passo, the Toyota Yaris, the Toyota Agya, the Toyota Belta, the Toyota iQ, and for the Daihatsu Boon, the Daihatsu Cuore, the Daihatsu Ayla and the Daihatsu Boon-based Subaru Justy (see Toyota KR engine). Nissan has developed a 1.2-litre three-cylinder version of their HR series of petrol engines, which is used since 2010 for the Nissan Micra, the Nissan Almera (Thailand) and the Nissan Note. There is also a supercharged version, with direct injection and variable valve timing. The Hyundai Motor Group used a 1.5-litre three-cylinder diesel engine (developed by VM Motori) on the second generation of the Hyundai Accent, the Hyundai Getz and the Hyundai Matrix, and developed its own 1.1-litre three-cylinder diesel engine (part of their U-Line), which has been used in the Kia Picanto and the Hyundai i10. Another 1.0-litre three-cylinder petrol engine (part of the Kappa series) has been used in the Hyundai i10 and the Hyundai HB20. Exclusively for the Indian market, the Chevrolet Beat is offered with a 1.0-litre (936 cc) three-cylinder diesel engine, called XSDE (Xtra Smart Diesel Engine). It was co-developed by GM Powertrain Torino and the GM Technical Center India, and uses the Fiat MultiJet diesel technology. Ford started offering their new turbocharged 1.0-litre three-cylinder EcoBoost unit in the Focus from 2012, having never before built a regular production car engine with fewer than four cylinders. This new engine features several innovations, including the use of an unbalanced flywheel to shift the inherent three-cylinder imbalance to the horizontal plane where it is more easily managed by engine mounts, and so remove the need to use balancer shafts. In 2013, it was made available for the Fiesta. In 2015, this engine was named International Engine of the Year ‘Best Engine Under 1.0‑litre’ for the fourth consecutive year. Ford claimed at the time that ten models in Europe could be equipped with the 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine, and that one in five all-new Ford vehicles sold in Europe in 2014 were equipped with the 1.0-litre unit, including almost two in five for Fiesta. In 2016, Ford offered a 1.0 litre turbocharged 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine with cylinder deactivation, claimed to be a world first for this feature in three- cylinder engines. The 7th generation of the Fiesta ST (2018) uses a turbocharged 1.5 litre 3-cylinder EcoBoost engine, replacing a four-cylinder engine in this model. In September 2012, Renault introduced a new turbocharged 0.9-liter TCe engine, that is used in the fourth generation of the Renault Clio, the Renault Captur and in the second generation of the Dacia Sandero and Dacia Logan. In October 2013, the PSA Peugeot Citroën group inaugurated the production line of their new turbocharged three-cylinder 1.2-litre petrol engine, in Douvrin, France. The engine, branded EB Turbo PureTech, will be first fitted on the Citroën C4 and the Peugeot 308, in the first half of 2014.http://www.psa-peugeot-citroen.com/en/inside-our-industrial- environment/innovation-and-rd/eb-turbo-puretech-engine-the-new-generation- petrol-turbo-engine-article Starting from 2014, the Opel Adam will be offered with a new turbocharged three-cylinder engine, mated to a six-speed manual gearbox. This engine, branded SIDI (Spark Ignition Direct Injection), uses direct injection, continuously variable valve timing and has a lightweight aluminium cylinder block. The BMW B38 is a DOHC 1.5 litre 3 cylinder turbocharged petrol engine. The B38 is the first use of BMW's modular engine strategy for gasoline and diesel engines, all using the same bore spacing, and all producible on the same assembly line equipment. This engine was first used in the 2013 BMW i8 and 2014 Mini Hatch - replacing the previous four-cylinder engine in the Mini - and is currently used in the BMW F40 118i, BMW F22 218i, BMW X1 sDrive18i, BMW X2 sDrive18i. It was previously used in the BMW F20 118i and BMW F30 318i. The BMW B37 is the diesel version of the above mentioned BMW B38, featuring many of the same parts. In this form as a 1.5 litre three- cylinder diesel engine, it is the most powerful of its cylinder for a diesel car (overtaking the previous highest, in the Mercedes-Benz OM639 with its 94 hp (70 kW)) creating 116 hp in its most powerful configuration. The engine was first used in the 2015 BMW F20 116d, replacing the previous N47 (a 4 cylinder engine) version used. Motorcycle use alt=Closeup picture of a motorcycle engine with three heavily chromed exhaust pipes coming out of the side For motorcycles, the inline three-cylinder engine is considered advantageous as it is narrower than an inline-four and produces less vibration than a twin cylinder vehicle.How Your Motorcycle Works: Your Guide to the Components & Systems of Modern Motorcycles.

Non-automotive use Fairbanks-Morse inline three diesel engine and pump Inline three-cylinder engines are not limited to propelling motor vehicles. They may also be used in general industrial applications. An example is the Fairbanks-Morse 32E14 slow-speed diesel engine which is shown coupled to a water pump. Agricultural use Inline three engines are common in diesel engined tractors, as well as other agricultural machinery. Nearly all manufacturers of diesel tractors have had models with three-cylinder engines. Perhaps the best known example of any kind of three- cylinder diesel engine is the Perkins AD3.152 that was used in Massey Ferguson 35 tractors, as well as in Fordson Dexta and several other tractors. This engine was also used for marine and stationary applications. Other manufacturers include Nuffield(BMC), Bolinder-Munktell/Volvo BM, International Harvester, John Deere, Deutz-Fahr, Kubota, Ford and many others.

He served as rector of Heidelberg University in 1564. Biography Born at Augsburg, he studied at Tübingen, and in 1558, when very short of money (caused, according to some, by his intemperate habits), he was appointed to succeed Jakob Micyllus in the professorship of Greek at the University of Heidelberg; he exchanged it for a chair of logic (publicus organi Aristotelici interpres) in 1562. In Heidelberg church and university politics, Xylander was a close partisan of Thomas Erastus. Xylander was the author of a number of important works, including Latin translations of Dio Cassius (1558), Plutarch (1560–1570) and Strabo (1571). He also edited (1568) the geographical lexicon of Stephanus of Byzantium; the travels of Pausanias (completed after his death by Friedrich Sylburg, 1583); the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius (1558), the editio princeps based on a Heidelberg manuscript now lost; a second edition in 1568 with the addition of Antoninus Liberalis, Phlegon of Tralles, an unknown Apollonius, and Antigonus of Carystus—all paradoxographers); and the chronicle of George Cedrenus (1566). He translated the first six books of Euclid into German with notes, the Arithmetica of Diophantus, and the De quattuor mathematicis scientiis of Michael Psellus into Latin.

His only surviving work is the Metamorphoses (Μεταμορφώσεων Συναγωγή, Metamorphoseon Synagoge, literally \\"Collection of Transformations\\"), a collection of forty-one very briefly summarised tales about mythical metamorphoses effected by offended deities, unique in that they are couched in prose, not verse. The literary genre of myths of transformations of men and women, heroes and nymphs, into stars (see Catasterismi), plants and animals, or springs, rocks and mountains, were widespread and popular in the classical world. This work has more polished parallels in the better-known Metamorphoses of Ovid and in the Metamorphoses of Lucius Apuleius. Like them, its sources, where they can be traced, are Hellenistic works, such as Nicander's Heteroeumena and Ornithogonia ascribed to Boios.Timothy Renner, \\"A Papyrus Dictionary of Metamorphoses,\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology (1978:278); many of Antoninus Liberalis' transformations are also into birds. The work survives in a single manuscript, of the later 9th century, now in the Palatine Library in Heidelberg; it contains several works. John of Ragusa brought it to the Dominican convent at Basel about 1437; in 1553, Hieronymus Froeben gave it to Otto Henry, Elector Palatine, who gave it to the Library. In 1623, with the rest of the Palatine Library, it was taken to Rome; in 1798, to Paris, as part of Napoleonic plunder under the terms of the Treaty of Tolentino; in 1816, it was restored to Heidelberg.Heidelberg al. gr. 398. Guilielmus Xylander printed the text in 1568; since some leaves have since disappeared, his edition is also a necessary authority for the text. Many of the transformations in this compilation are found nowhere else, and some may simply be inventions of Antoninus. The manner of the narrative is a laconic and conversational prose: \\"this completely inartistic text,\\" as Sarah Myers called it,Myers, University of Michigan, reviewing Celoria's translation in Bryn Mawr Classical Review, 1994 (on-line text). offers the briefest summaries of lost metamorphoses by more ambitious writers, such as Nicander and Boeus. Francis Celoria, the translator, regards the text as perfectly acceptable koine Greek, though with numerous hapax legomena; it is \\"grimly simple\\" and mostly devoid of grammatical particles which would convey humor or a narratorial persona.Celoria, The Metamorphoses of Antoninus Liberalis, 2.

It has borders with Chanthaburi Province to the northwest, Cambodia to the east, and the Gulf of Thailand to the south. Trat is 315 km from Bangkok. Trat is known for gemstone mining and trading. History The history of Trat can be traced back to the early 17th century during the reign of King Prasat Thong of the Ayutthaya Kingdom. Formerly known as Mueang Thung Yai, Trat has played an important role in the development of the country's stability and economy due to its strategic location. The town of Trat later become a community of Chinese merchants. After the fall of Ayutthaya to the Burmese in 1767, Trat served as a checkpoint and buffer city and was responsible for providing provisions to King Taksin the Great before he moved his forces from Chanthaburi to Ayutthaya. King Taksin then succeeded in driving out the Burmese invaders and liberated the kingdom from foreign rule. French troops, Trat (1904) In the Rattanakosin era, during the 1893 Paknam crisis, French troops landed and occupied the western part of Chantaburi Province. In 1904, Siam was forced to surrender Trat to French Indochina in order to regain Chantaburi. Three years later, however, finding that Trat with its almost entirely Thai population was hard to rule, the French returned Trat to Thailand on 23 March 1907, in exchange for larger areas along the Mekong river, which included Battambang, Siam Nakhon, and Sisophon, which all have a Khmer majority population. During the French-Thai War of 1940-1941, the Vichy French navy sailed from Saigon to seize Trat. The unprepared Thai warships were caught by surprise. By the end of the 17 January 1941 Battle of Ko Chang, three Thai ships had been left sinking: the HTMS Chonburi, HTMS Songkhla, and HTMS Thonburi. French casualties were light with no ships lost. The Japanese government negotiated a truce, which ended the conflict without further fighting. When the Vietnamese pushed the Khmer Rouge out of Cambodia in 1985, Pol Pot fled to Thailand and made his headquarters in a plantation villa near Trat. It was built for him by the Thai Army and nicknamed \\"Office 87\\". Geography The province covers a land area of 2,917 square kilometers or 1,71,000 rai. The Cardamom mountain range forms the boundary to Cambodia in the east of the province, where Trat has borders with three Cambodian provinces: Battambang, Pursat, and Koh Kong. The third biggest island of Thailand is the province's Ko Chang (after Phuket and Ko Samui). The island and more than 40 surrounding smaller islands form the Mu Ko Chang Marine National Park. Other islands of the province include Ko Kham, Ko Mak, and Ko Phi. Climate Most of Thailand receives from 1,200 to 1,600 mm of precipitation per year. Two provinces, Trat and Ranong, receive more than 4,500 mm a year making them the wettest places in the country. Symbols The provincial seal shows the sea with the Khao Banthat mountain range in the background. The provincial tree is the tropical almond (Terminalia catappa). Administration Map of 7 districts Provincial government The province is divided into seven districts (amphoes). These are further divided into 38 subdistricts (tambons) and 254 villages (mubans). #Mueang Trat /məʊŋtrɑt/ #Khlong Yai /klɔŋyɑɪ/ #Khao Saming /kăo-sà-mĭŋ/ #Bo Rai bɔː rɑɪ/ #Laem Ngop /læmŋɔːb/ #Ko Kut gɔguːd/ #Ko Chang /gɔtʃɑːŋ/ Local government As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Trat Provincial Administration Organisation (ongkan borihan suan changwat) and 14 municipal (thesaban) areas in the province.

Taxonomy The species was first described by the British taxonomist John Edward Gray in 1846. Due to its relative abundance in European waters, it was among the first of the genus Lagenorhynchus (lagenos, Latin for \\"bottle\\" or \\"flask\\"; rhynchos, \\"beak\\" or \\"snout\\") to be known to science. Its specific name, albirostris, translates to \\"white beak\\", a reference to the color of the species' beak, a diagnostic (albeit variable) trait useful in identification. Description Skeleton The white-beaked dolphin is a robust species of dolphin with a short beak. Adults can reach long and weigh . Calves are long at birth and probably weigh about . The upper body and flanks are dark grey with light grey patches, including a 'saddle' behind the dorsal fin, while the underside is light grey to almost white in color. The flippers, fluke, and the tall, falcate, dorsal fin are all a darker grey than the body. As the common name implies, the beak is usually white in color, but it may be a dark, ashy grey, in some older individuals. White- beaked dolphins have 25 to 28 teeth in each jaw, although the three teeth closest to the front of the mouth are often not visible, failing to erupt from the gums. They have up to 92 vertebrae, more than any other species of oceanic dolphin. Although the young are born with two to four whiskers on each side of the upper lip, these disappear as they grow, and, as in other odontocetes, the adults are entirely hairless. The humerus of the right flipper has been recorded as being longer and more robust than that on the left, indicating a degree of lateralized behavior. Distribution and habitat Off the coast of Iceland The white-beaked dolphin is endemic to the cold temperate and subarctic waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, most commonly in seas less than deep. They are found in a band stretching across the ocean from Cape Cod, the mouth of the St. Lawrence River and southern Greenland in the west, around Iceland in the centre, and across in the west from northern France to Svalbard; however, they are not well adapted to truly Arctic conditions.Polar bears eating dolhins as waters warm Bloomberg News, retrieved June 12, 2015 Due to the fact they are not fully adapted to Arctic conditions, they are more vulnerable to predators, most notably polar bears. Within this wider region, white-beaked dolphins are most commonly found in four locales: on the Labrador Shelf close to southwestern Greenland, around Iceland, off the northern and eastern coasts of Britain, and off the coast of Norway. There are no recognised subspecies. The dolphin may easily be misidentified as the Atlantic white-sided dolphin, although the white-beaked is commonly found further north. The white-beaked dolphin is also typically larger, and does not have yellow streaks on its side. Biology and behavior Off the coast of Scotland The population, breeding pattern, and life expectancy of the dolphin are all unknown, although most sources estimate several hundred thousand individuals, more densely populated in the eastern North Atlantic than the west. White- beaked dolphins feed predominantly on gadoid fishes, particularly cod, haddock, and whiting. They are social animals, most commonly found in groups of less than ten, but sometimes in much larger associations of over a hundred individuals. Their sonar clicks have a peak frequency of 115 kHz, while their social whistles are at around 35 kHz, and can be audible to others of their species at distances of up to . White-beaked dolphins are acrobatic; they will frequently ride on the bow wave of high-speed boats and jump clear of the sea's surface. Although they are normally much slower, they can swim at up to and can dive to at least depth. They are social feeders and have frequently been observed feeding with killer, fin, and humpback whales, as well as other dolphin species. Mating probably takes place in the summer, with calves being born in the following year, between June and September. Females reach their adult size at around five years of age, and are sexually mature at six to ten years, while males reach adult size at around ten years, and reach sexual maturity about two years later than females. Conservation The North and Baltic Sea populations of the white-beaked dolphin are listed on Appendix II\\"Appendix II \\" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).

It was produced by Tyne Tees Television for Channel 4, which had previously produced the similar music show Alright Now and the music-oriented youth show Check it Out for ITV; production of the latter ended in favour of The Tube. The Tube was presented live by hosts including Jools Holland, Paula Yates, Leslie Ash, Muriel Gray, Gary James, Michel Cremona, Felix Howard, Tony Fletcher, Nick Laird-Clowes and Mike Everitt. Sunderland band The Toy Dolls were the first band to play live on The Tube. The brand name was relaunched by Channel 4 as an online radio station in November 2006. The show was directed by Gavin Taylor; Geoff Wonfor directed some of the insert videos along with other staff programme director of Tyne Tees Television Martin Cairns. Many other specials were made, including one for the eve of the millennium. Showcase for contemporary bands The Tube was a showcase for many emerging 1980s bands. The Tube was an important outlet for the performers. For The Proclaimers, performing \\"Letter from America\\" on The Tube was instrumental in helping the Scottish duo to their first top ten UK hit; it was also responsible for introducing Frankie Goes to Hollywood to their record label ZTT and its co-owner, and their producer Trevor Horn. In addition to being the launchpad for new and upcoming performers, The Tube became known for its high-profile music performance 'scoops' from established world class musicians such as U2 live at Red Rocks, Madonna, Robert Plant, Tina Turner, Bo Diddley and ZZ Top. The show was also fortunate to persuade Ringo Starr to give one of the first post-Beatles interviews in an extended article on his work with Marc Bolan and T. Rex, filmed at his then (and previously John Lennon's) house, Tittenhurst Park. It was during the 50th show in November 1984 that Bob Geldof allegedly ran into Midge Ure and suggested the idea of a fund-raising single for the Christmas market to help the Ethiopian famine, the project that would become Band Aid and later Live Aid. The Jam performed on the first edition of the show in 1982, it was their last live TV appearance together before they split up at the end of the year. Half Man Half Biscuit famously turned down the chance to appear on the show, as Tranmere Rovers were playing that night, even though Channel Four offered to fly them by helicopter to the game.Give Us An ‘R’ interview. – Tranmere Rovers fanzine issue 52. Format The cornerstone of the shows was the live performances from three or four bands each week. In an era where most music TV shows featured non-stop miming, the fully live sets by the guest artists were innovative (but the sound mix was often very poor, with a curious quality that made it sound like everything had been 'phased'). The programme would start with a 45-minute magazine section consisting of interviews, fashion items and comedy appearances by a wide range of alternative artistes such as Frank Sidebottom, Vic Reeves (before his association with Bob Mortimer), Foffo Spearjig and even French & Saunders. During this section Yates would become known for conducting rather flirtatious interviews: in 1985, for example, she prompted Sting to remove his trousers. The main presenters were supported, for the first two series, by five newcomers who were picked following a nationally advertised competition: these were Muriel Gray, Gary James, Nick Laird-Clowes, Michel Cremona and Mike Everitt. The supporting presenters took turns to co- present. The show usually featured four or five band appearances per week, with one main extended session to close. The format of the show was extended following Series 1 with a number of special events - most notably A Midsummer Night's Tube (1984), a 5-hour version broadcast live from the Tyne Tees studios, the pub across the road from the studios and The Hoppings annual fair in Newcastle. This ground breaking broadcast was, at the time, the longest continuous live music show in television history and received much critical and technical acclaim. Studio 5 was also used to produce a spin-off show called TX45. This show ran for two series hosted by Chris Cowey and produced by Jeff Brown and featured local bands such as The Kane Gang, Caught in the Act, Secret Sam, She and President. The programme's theme music, the instrumental \\"TX45\\", was by Sophie and Peter Johnston, based on the song of theirs, \\"Some Sunny Day\\". A video clip of them performing it is available. Many stars drank in the neighbouring pub The Egypt Cottage, using it as a green room. Jools Holland said \\"A legendary amount of things happened in the Egypt Cottage, and the Rose and Crown when it was on the other side of the road. Everyone – the likes of Miles Davis, Paul McCartney – who came up for The Tube will have sat in that pub.\\" The pub was demolished in 2009. Between 1986–87, the series had a summer replacement named Wired which lasted two series. Demise In January 1987, during the fifth series, Jools Holland used the phrase \\"be there or be ungroovy fuckers\\" during a live trailer for the show.'Quite a lot has happened' Louise Carpenter, The FT , October 13, 2007 . Accessed October 2014 The incident caused a national scandal, as the trailer was transmitted at a peak children's viewing time and the show was taken off air for three weeks as a result. Holland was reprimanded by Channel 4, as this was not the first time he had accidentally sworn on the live show. The show's producer, Malcolm Gerrie, and Tyne Tees' Director of Programmes, Andrea Wonfor, announced their resignations in March. They cited as reasons for doing so a mixture of internal bickering, political pressure and \\"stifling bureaucracy and heavy-handed moralism\\". A further series was never commissioned. In truth, the viewing figures for the series had dropped significantly, and the original format had been watered down. Some people close to the show had said that Holland's swearing was seen as a convenient way of ending the show. The presenters' live interviews and filmed magazine items were nervously watched by the show's producers and editors as well as Channel 4 executives, especially when certain pop stars and celebrities not known for their shy and retiring nature were being featured. It was this that gave the show the curious feeling of 'anything might happen' that actually made it the success it was. For Holland, Yates and Gray it was the launch pad for successful careers in television. In 1999 The Tube was brought back for a one-off live special on Sky1 entitled \\"The Apocalypse Tube\\". Hosted by BBC Radio 1's Chris Moyles and Donna Air, the show came live again from Studio 5 at Tyne Tees and the bar of the Egypt Cottage next door. 'The Tube' took its name from the plastic-roofed structure that linked Tyne Tees Studio 5 to the street. This has now been demolished. In 2005 Tyne Tees Television moved from its City Road complex on Newcastle Quayside. In July 2006 Studio 5 of the TTTV City Road site was leased by an evangelical money church, and the whole complex was demolished in 2010. The famous Tube neon sign was bought at auction by Tyne and Wear Museums for a future display at the Discovery Museum in Newcastle's Blandford Square. Radio revival In November 2006, the brand was revived as a radio show, also entitled The Tube for Channel 4 Radio. Presenters Konnie Huq, Alex James and Tony Wilson hosted the main show (The Tube) and filler show (Mind The Gap). Available on the Internet In July 2008 ITN (rights holder for The Tube) signed a deal with MUZU TV to make The Tube available online.

Claimed as the founder of the pseudoscience of phrenology,Graham, Patrick. (2001) Phrenology [videorecording (DVD)] : revealing the mysteries of the mind . Richmond Hill, Ont. : American Home Treasures. Gall was an early and important researcher in his fields. His contributions to the field of neuropsychology were controversial at the time and are now widely referred to as pseudoscience. However, Gall's study of phrenology helped establish psychology, contributed to the emergence of the naturalistic approach to the study of man, and played an important part in the development of evolutionist theories, anthropology, and sociology.Livianos et al 2007  Early life  Gall was born in the village of Tiefenbronn to a wealthy Roman Catholic wool merchant. The Galls, originally a noble family from Lombardy,http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Franz_Joseph_Gall.aspx had been the leading family in the area for over a century. His father was the mayor of Tiefenbronn and he was one of 12 children, only 7 of whom lived to adulthood.Gall 1835 Gall's scientific inquiry began in his youth. As a boy, he was fascinated by the differences between himself, his siblings, and his classmates. He developed an early interest in the brain after making a connection between one classmate's odd shaped skull and advanced language abilities.Eling 1994 He enjoyed collecting and categorizing plants and animals. He also realized the importance of observation as a scientific technique at a young age.Tomlinson 2005  Education and early career  As the second eldest son, he was intended for the priesthood but chose instead to study medicine at the University of Strasbourg. In his advanced studies, he again made observations about his classmates. He noticed that many of the particularly bright students had prominent eyeballs and concluded that this could not be purely coincidental.Gall 1835 He later completed his degree in Vienna, Austria. While in medical school, he studied under Johann Hermann and Maximilian Stoll who impressed upon him the importance of natural observation.Van Whye 2002 He took his first job at Lunatic Asylum making observations about the insane.Gall 1835 He then opened up his own successful private practice and became so popular he even gave well attended lectures to the public.Tomlinson 2005 He was offered the position as head Austrian Court physician but decided to remain in private practice and research.Davies 1955  Contributions to phrenology  Franz Joseph Gall examining the head of a pretty young girl Based on his early observations about the skull sizes and facial features of his classmates, Gall developed the theory of Organology and the method of Cranioscopy that would later be known as Phrenology. Gall's version of Organology states that the mind is a collection of independent entities housed within the brain. Cranioscopy is a method to determine the personality and development of mental and moral faculties on the basis of the external shape of the skull. During his lifetime, Gall collected and observed over 120 skulls in order to test his hypotheses. Gall believed that the bumps and uneven geography of the human skull were caused by pressure exerted from the brain underneath. He divided the brain into sections that corresponded to certain behaviors and traits that he called fundamental faculties. This is referred to as localization of function. Gall believed there were 27 fundamental faculties, among them were: recollection of people, mechanical ability, talent for poetry, love of property, and even a murder instinct. Based on the surface of a person's skull, Gall could make assumptions about that person's fundamental faculties and therefore their character. Gall disagreed with Philippe Pinel and Peter Camper that the larger brain the larger one's intellectual power. However, after numerous dissections and observations he was able to assert that a mature skull under 14 inches in circumference was not able to function normally.Tomlinson 2005  Relationship with Johann Spurzheim  In 1800, Johann Spurzheim attended one of Gall's public lectures and was hired as an assistant to help with public medical demonstrations. In 1804, he became Gall's full-time research partner.Tomlinson 2005 They worked together for years to develop theories about brain localization and function. In 1813, Spurzheim separated from Gall in order to make a name for himself in Britain. Gall would later accuse Spurzheim of plagiarism and perverting his work.Tomlinson 2005 It was Spurzheim who would give the name phrenology to Gall's theories.  Other achievements  Other than his contributions to phrenology, Gall is lesser known for his other achievements. While developing his theories on localization of function, Gall significantly advanced the science of dissection. Instead of slicing randomly, as had been the practice in previous years, Gall's method involved slow exploration of the entire brain structure and the separation of individual fibers.Colbert 1997 This shift in methodology was extremely influential in future discoveries of the brain. Gall also researched and theorized about language, communication, and the brain. He argued that pantomime, or the science of gesture, was a universal language for all animals and humans. He believed every living thing was born with the ability to understand gestures on some level.Tomlinson 2005 In 1823, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He published a book titled On the Functions of the Brain and of Each of Its parts: With Observations on the Possibility of Determining the Instincts, Propensities, and Talents, Or the Moral and Intellectual Dispositions of Men and Animals, by the Configuration of the Brain and Head detailing his vast research on brain function and localization. It was translated to English in 1835 by Lewis Winslow.Gall 1835  Reception and controversy  Gall's concepts on brain localization were revolutionary, and caused religious leaders and some scientists to take exception. The Roman Catholic Church considered his theory as contrary to religion. Established science also condemned these ideas for lack of scientific proof of his theory. Still others attempted to discredit Gall because they believed he had not given rightful credit to the theories and scientists who influenced him. Étienne-Jean Georget accused Gall of stealing Charles Bonnet's basic idea of brain localization that he had written about over 60 years earlier.Tomlinson 2005 His ideas were also not acceptable to the court of the emperor Joseph II (the brother of Marie Antoinette). The Austrian government accused Gall of being a materialist and banned his ideas because of their threat to public morality.Tomlinson 2005 Due to this opposition, Gall left his lecturer position in Austria. He sought a teaching position in Germany and eventually settled in Paris. Revolutionary France was most likely the most hospitable place for Gall's theories. However, Napoleon Bonaparte, the ruling emperor, and the scientific establishment led by the Institute of France, pronounced his science as invalid. Despite all this, Gall was able to secure a comfortable existence on the basis of his speciality. He became a celebrity of sorts as he was accepted into Parisian intellectual salons. Gall's phrenological theories and practices were best accepted in England, where the ruling class used it to justify the \\"inferiority\\" of its colonial subjects. It also became very popular in the United States from 1820 to 1850. One interesting influence was on psychiatry, where the South Italian psychiatrist Biagio Gioacchino Miraglia proposed a new classification of mental illness based on brain functions as they were conceived in Gall's phrenology.Miraglia, Biagio G. (1874/2014). A new classification of mental illness based on brain functions. Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences, 7(2):63–67.  Legacy  In spite of many problems associated with his work, Gall made significant contributions to neurological science. He died in Paris, on 22 August 1828. Although married, he remained childless. Some direct descendants of his brothers lived in Germany until 1949. A collection of his skulls can be seen at the Rollett Museum in Baden bei Wien, Austria, where several of his relatives now live.Strange teachings about heads (Bundesministerium fur Inneres). Today, phrenology is thought of as a huge mis-step by the scientific community. The idea that a person's personality could be determined by the shape of their skull has been repeatedly disproven. But at the time, Gall's arguments were persuasive and intriguing. Even though phrenology is now known to be incorrect, Gall did set the groundwork for modern neuroscience by spreading the idea of functional localization within the brain. The misuse of Gall's ideas and work to justify discrimination were deliberately furthered by his associates, including Johann Spurzheim. Later, others tried to improve on his theories with systems such as characterology. Gall's theories had an influence both on the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso and on his French rival, Alexandre Lacassagne. He also influenced the French anatomist, Paul Broca.

Nearly 100 roads in the North and South Islands are state highways. All state highways are administered by the NZ Transport Agency. The highways were originally designated using a two-tier system, national (SH 1 to 8) and provincial, with national highways having a higher standard and funding priorities. Now all are state highways, and the network consists of SH 1 running the length of both islands, SH 2 to 5 and 10 to 58 in the North Island, and SH 6 to 8 and 60 to 99 in the South Island, numbered approximately north to south. State highways are marked by red shield-shaped signs with white numbering (shields for the former provincial highways were blue). Road maps usually number state highways in this fashion. Of the total state highway network, New Zealand currently has 363 km of motorways and expressways with grade-separated access and they carry ten percent of all New Zealand traffic. The majority of the state highway network is made up of single-carriageway roads with one lane each way and at- grade access. History  Palmerston, Otago. In the early days all roads were managed by local road boards. Initially they were set up by the Provinces. For example, Auckland Province passed a Highways Act in 1862 allowing their Superintendent to define given areas of settlement as Highways Districts, each with a board of trustees elected by the landowners. Land within the boundaries of highway districts became subject to a rate of not more than 1/- an acre, or of 3d in the £ of its estimated sale value and that was to be equalled by a grant from the Province.C W Vennell & Susan Williams: Raglan County Hills and Sea 1876–1976 By 1913 the government was collecting £21,000 in duty on cars, but spending £40,000 on roads. The idea of a national network of highways did not emerge until the early twentieth century, when a series of pieces of legislation was passed to allow for the designation of main highways (starting with the Main Highways Act 1922, followed by gazetting of roads) and state highways (in 1936). This saw the National Roads Board, an arm of the Ministry of Works, responsible for the state highway network. From 1989 to 2008, state highways were the responsibility of Transit New Zealand, a Crown entity. In 1996 the funding of the network was removed from the operational functions with the creation of Transfund New Zealand, which then merged with the Land Transport Safety Authority to create Land Transport New Zealand. That was done to ensure that funding of state highways was considered on a similar basis to funding for local roads and regional council subsidised public transport. In August 2008, Transit and Land Transport NZ merged to become the NZ Transport Agency. Every five years the NZ Transport Agency will embark on a state highway review to consider whether the existing network should be expanded or reduced, according to traffic flows, changes in industry, tourism and development. From 2009 many new road schemes were classed as Roads of National Significance and, from 2020, as part of the New Zealand Upgrade Programme.  Classification  Since 2013, the NZTA has used the One Network Road Classification (ONRC) system to classify state highways and local roads. There are five categories for state highways, with an additional sixth category (Access) used only by local roads. The categories are as follows: *National: Generally these roads link the country's largest urban areas (population greater than 100,000) major ports and major airports. They generally have an annual average daily traffic volume (AADT) of 15,000 or more. Examples includes most of SH 1, SH 29, the Wellington–Palmerston North–Napier route (SH 57, SH 3, SH 2, SH 50A and SH 50) and most State Highways in the Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch urban areas. *Regional: Generally these roads link the country's main urban areas (population greater than 30,000), medium-sized ports, medium-sized airports, and major tourist destinations, or are the major route linking an isolated region. They generally have an AADT of 10,000 or more. Examples include most of SH 2 and SH 3, SH 5, SH 73, and Queenstown–Milford Sound route (SH 6, SH 97 and SH 94). *Arterial: Generally these roads link the country's secondary urban areas (population greater than 10,000), medium-sized ports and regional airports, or are the only route linking an isolated area or provide an important detour function. They generally have an AADT of 3000 or more. Examples includes most of SH 6, SH 8, SH 27, and the SH 1 Desert Road detour (SH 46, SH 47, SH 4 and SH 49) *Primary collector: Generally these roads link the country's minor urban areas (population greater than 2000). They generally have an AADT of 1000 or more. Examples includes most of SH 4, SH 7, SH 35, and SH 83. *Secondary collector: Generally these roads link rural towns (population less than 2000) or rural areas. They generally have an AADT of less than 1000. Examples include SH 43, SH 63, SH 85 and SH 87.  Volumes  From 2006 information, the busiest stretch of SH 1 was just south of the Auckland Central Motorway Junction, on/near the Newmarket Viaduct, with over 200,000 vehicles (either way) each day. The least busy parts of the network (excluding off-ramps and on-ramps) are on SH 43 north-east of Whangamōmona, with fewer than 120 vehicles (counting both directions) in a day. The only remaining unsealed sections of state highway are of SH 43 and of SH 38, though 38% of other roads remain unsealed. Every year the New Zealand Transport Agency produces a booklet titled AADT Data, average annualised daily traffic, that gives traffic volumes on all state highways from their automated vehicle recording system. Distance markers State Highway 1 crosses the Waikouaiti River in Otago, 667.0 kilometres from Picton. State highways are marked with posts at irregular intervals giving the distance in kilometres from the start of the highway. Until recently, all bridges on the network had at each end a small plaque showing the distance from the start of the highway, usually in the form of a number in kilometres, an oblique stroke, and a further number in kilometres, accurate to the nearest 10 metres. A plaque marked 237/14.12, for example, indicated that the bridge was 14.12 km past a set distance post, that post being 237 km from the start of the highway. In about 2004 these plaques were replaced by a new system, which gives each bridge a single number showing the distance from the start of the highway in hundreds of metres. Under the new system the bridge above would be numbered 2511, as it is 251.1 km from the start of the highway. Motorway on- and off-ramps are numbered using the same system. In this way, travellers can accurately assess their location, and road authorities can identify each bridge uniquely. Sometimes, houses with RAPID numbering can also be used to determine the position. For example, house number 1530 is 15.3 km from the start of the highway. Safety In early 2008, Transit New Zealand unveiled KiwiRAP (the New Zealand Road Assessment Programme) in cooperation with other government agencies and the New Zealand Automobile Association. The system, based on similar programs overseas, categorises New Zealand state highways according to the safety of discrete 'links' (sections of the network, with a total of 10,856 km of highways separated into 172 links ranging in length from 2.4 km to 318 km). These are graded according to their 'individual risk' and their 'collective risk' based on historical crash data and traffic volumes. The individual risk is based on the likelihood of a single driver experiencing an accident while travelling the link in question. As of 2008, the three least safe sections of the network based on individual risk were State Highway 62 from Spring Creek to Renwick (Marlborough), State Highway 37 to Waitomo Caves and State Highway 94 from Te Anau to Milford Sound. The collective risk is based on the total number of crashes that occurred on the link, which pushes safer but very highly travelled sections of the network to the top of the statistical category. As of 2008, the three least safe sections of the network based on collective risk were all on State Highway 2, on the sections from Napier to Hastings, Mount Maunganui to Paengaroa and Bay View to Napier. Both categories of assessment are to be used as an advisory tool for both drivers to inform them of dangerous road sections as well as to allow traffic controlling authorities to prioritise maintenance and safety improvements. The 2015–18 National Land Transport Programme aimed to invest $3.2bn (23% of the NLTP total) in safety, including $960m for policing, $132m for road safety promotion and $103m for rural SH safety. The Safe Roads Alliance is carrying out rural work on SH 1 (Waikato Expressway, Te Teko-Awakeri), SH 1B (Taupiri-Gordonton), SH 3 (Ohaupo-Te Awamutu, Waitomo-Te Kuiti), SH 11 (Airfield-Lily Pond), SH 12 (Dargaville-Tokatoka), SH 16 (Brigham Creek-Waimauku), SH 23 (Hamilton- Raglan), SH 27 (SH 26-SH 24) and SH 34 (SH 30 to Kawerau). The Alliance is using speed reductions, wire rope barriers, wide centrelines, rumble strips, better warning signs and shoulder widening. Specific sections State Highway 1 State Highway 1 State Highway 1 can be considered as a single highway running the length of both main islands, broken in the middle by the ferry connection at Cook Strait. It connects five of the seven largest urban areas and includes the country's busiest stretch of road. Touring routes Many sections of state highway provided are marketed as tourist highways, sometimes jointly with local roading providers. Transit maintains traffic signs on and near state highways to help promote these routes. These include: * Twin Coast Discovery Highway – ring route around the Auckland and Northland regions * Pacific Coast Highway – route going around the north-east coast of the North Island, joining Auckland and Napier * Thermal Explorer Highway – route going from Auckland to Napier through the geothermally active centre of the North Island * Surf Highway – alternative name for SH 45 from New Plymouth to Hawera. Named due to the number of surf breaks along the Taranaki coastline. * Classic New Zealand Wine Trail 20px – a route through three of New Zealand's major wine regions, from Napier to Blenheim, via Hastings, Woodville, Masterton, Martinborough, Wellington, and Picton. Requires a ferry crossing across Cook Strait between Wellington and Picton. * Alpine Pacific Triangle – a triangular loop including sections of SH 1, 7 and Route 70 (20px) linking the popular destinations of Hanmer Springs, Kaikoura and Waipara * Inland Scenic Route 20px – formerly SH 72, this road goes from Amberley to Winchester (near Timaru). This road follows around the foot of the Canterbury Foothills, inland on the Canterbury plains. * Great Alpine Highway – Highway 73 going from Christchurch in Canterbury over the Southern Alps via Arthurs Pass to Kumara Junction on the West Coast. * Southern Scenic Route 20px – route going along the southern coast of the South Island from Dunedin via the Catlins, Invercargill and Riverton to Te Anau  See also  * List of New Zealand state highways * List of roads and highways, for notable or famous roads worldwide References  External links  * Highways information portal at NZ Transport Agency *Virtual Highway (Google Maps-based interactive state highway map, including videos of major highways) Category:Roads in New Zealand ","title":"New Zealand state highway network"},{"id":"310322","text":"Rahman Ali (born Rudolph Valentino Clay; July 18, 1944) is an American former heavyweight boxer.

The other family is the Tachyglossidae, or echidnas. Within the Ornithorhynchidae are the genera Monotrematum, Obdurodon, and Ornithorhynchus: *Family Ornithorhynchidae **Genus † Monotrematum ***†Monotrematum sudamericanum **Genus †Obdurodon — an ancient branch of the platypus family ***†Obdurodon dicksoni ***†Obdurodon insignis ***†Obdurodon tharalkooschild **Genus Ornithorhynchus ***Ornithorhynchus anatinus (the modern platypus) Another two genera, Steropodon and Teinolophos, were originally thought to belong to the Ornithorhynchidae. However, they were both placed into a new family, the Steropodontidae. This decision was made based on differences in the dentary recovered from the Griman Creek Formation, Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia. This dentary is the holotype for the genus Steropodon, thus the lack of information led to the original misclassification. Further research on Teinolophos has indeed shown it to be an animal much different from ornithochrynchids, lacking a beak, possessing a more complete mammalian dentition, and retaining primitive ears connected to the jaw as in more basal mammals.Thomas H.

Filling out the band were Buck's brother, Stephen Bury (taking the stage name \\"Hector Naked\\") and David Wees (known on stage as \\"Stinky LePew\\"). Despite its name, the rest of the band were more or less fully clothed on stage. The band became friends with the band Primus. Sharing many aesthetic similarities, the latter would make numerous tributes to Bury, in their videos (\\"Mr. Krinkle\\" features a painting, \\"Wynona's Big Brown Beaver\\" features a bass drum head), and in the album credits to 1993's Pork Soda. The band's career came to an abrupt end in 1992 when Bury was shot and killed while walking his dog in Golden Gate Park's Panhandle by a cab driver named Michael Kagan, who had for many years fed pigeons there. According to witnesses at the trial, Kagan had been known to threaten dogs who chased the pigeons, and, on occasion, their owners. Kagan appealed the case to the California Supreme Court, but his conviction for manslaughter was upheld. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison, the maximum term allowed.

Projects in development hell are not officially cancelled, but progress slows, changes or stops completely. Overview Film industry companies often buy the film rights to many popular novels, video games, and comic books, but it may take years for such properties to be successfully brought to the screen, and often with considerable changes to the plot, characters, and general tone. This pre- production process can last for months or years. More often than not, a project trapped in this state for a prolonged period of time will be abandoned by all interested parties or canceled outright. As Hollywood starts ten times as many projects as there are released, many scripts will end up in this limbo state.\\"Cover Story: Writers Paid for Movies Never Made,\\" Spillman, Susan. USA Today.

Under TOPS, this train and other examples of the same type are designated as British Rail Class 483. Total Operations Processing System (TOPS) is a computer system for managing the locomotives and rolling stock owned by or operated on a rail system. It was originally developed by the Southern Pacific Railroad, the Stanford University and IBM and was introduced on the railroad in 1968; despite being widely sold to the United States railroads, the system found greater success in the United Kingdom, where it has been used by British Rail (BR) and its successors. Southern Pacific itself developed a newer system called the Terminal Information Processing System (TIPS), which replaced TOPS in 1980. Early development The Southern Pacific Railroad was an early adopter of technology. In the early 1960s, it developed a computer system called \\"Total Operations Processing System\\" (TOPS). The purpose was to take all the paperwork associated with a locomotive or rolling stock - its maintenance history, its allocation to division and depot and duty, its status, its location, and much more - and keep it in computer form, constantly updated by terminals at every maintenance facility., Pp515-516. On paper, this information was difficult to keep track of, difficult to keep up to date, and difficult to query, requiring many telephone calls. Computerizing this information enabled a railroad to keep better track of its assets, and to use them better. In order to offset the development costs of the system, Southern Pacific sold it to other railroads. A number of American railroads took to the system, as did many others around the world. Adoption by British Rail In the mid to late 1960s, British Rail (BR) was looking for ways to increase efficiency, and was alerted to the TOPS system in a 1968 presentation by E. Wrathall, an IBM US Transportation Industry Representative, who, shortly after, formed IBM World Trade Corp's Transportation Industry Centre in Brussels. British Rail purchased the system, along with the source code (as was typical in those days for such a large mainframe-based system), and implemented it, assisted by Southern Pacific data processing experts. At the time, the British Government operated a 'Buy British' policy for the nationalised industries, and the purchase of an IBM System/360 mainframe to operate TOPS had to be approved by the Heath cabinet. The adoption of the TOPS system made for some changes in the way the railway system in Britain worked. Hitherto, locomotives had been numbered in three different series. Steam locomotives carried unadorned numbers up to five digits long. Diesel locomotives carried one to four-digit numbers prefixed with a letter 'D', and electric locomotives with a letter 'E'. Thus, up to three locomotives could carry the same number. TOPS could not handle that, and it also required similar locomotives to be numbered in a consecutive series in terms of classification, so that they might be treated as a group. TOPS numbering under British Rail Class 31 under TOPS. This is the data panel from a Class 31/4; the 31/4 subclass being used for locomotives with Electric Train Heating. Sequentiality was all that was required but, given the need to renumber, it was decided to adopt a logical system for classification, and the five- or six-digit TOPS number was divided into two parts. No class of locomotive or multiple unit numbered over 1000 examples, so the last three digits were used for the individual number between 001 and 999 in that class, although Class 43 goes down to 000, that being the number of only remaining HST prototype power car. The first two or three digits were used to denote the class of locomotive or multiple unit. The numbers were often written in two space separated groups, such as \\"47 401\\" to highlight that division, but the TOPS system actually stored and displayed them without the space: \\"47401\\". Sub-classifications were indicated in the TOPS system with a slash and a subclass number, e.g. \\"47/4\\". It was convention, though not enforced within the TOPS system, that subclass numbers were boundaries in the locomotive numbering system, such that class \\"47/4\\" started with number \\"47 401\\". If there were more than 99 numbers in a subclass, the number series extended to the next value of the third digit; thus, since there were more than 200 locomotives in class \\"47/4\\", subclasses \\"47/5\\" and \\"47/6\\" did not exist, and the next valid subclass by convention was \\"47/7\\" starting with \\"47 701\\". However, in some cases, the sequences do not match, e.g. 158/0 numbers start at 158 701. Locomotives are assigned classes 01–98: diesel locomotives 01–79 (originally 01–69), AC electric locomotives 80–96, departmental locos (those not in revenue-earning use) 97, and steam locomotives 98. DC electric locomotives were originally allocated classes 70–79 but this was modified in 2011 (see British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification); the sole relic of this is Class 73 which continues unrenumbered, probably because it can be considered equally a diesel locomotive as it is a DC electric. One oddity was the inclusion of British Rail's shipping fleet in the system as Class 99. Diesel multiple units (DMUs) with mechanical or hydraulic transmission are classified 100–199, with electric transmission 200–299. Electric multiple units (EMUs) are given the subsequent classes; 300–399 are overhead AC units (including AC/DC dual- voltage units, and new DC only units with pantogaph wells allowing for conversion to AC), while Southern Region DC third rail EMUs are 400–499, other DC EMUs 500–599. More recently, new electric multiple units from the Siemens Desiro family have been given the 700 series and new units from the Hitachi A-train family have been given the 800 series. Selected numbers in the 900 series have been used for departmental multiple units, mostly converted from former passenger units. Coaching stock and individual multiple unit cars are allocated five-digit numbers; since the early 1980s, it has been forbidden for them to have the same numbers as locomotives, but before then duplication was possible because they carried a prefix letter, which was considered part of the number. More recent EMU deliveries have six-figure coach numbers. Recent history TOPS has become outdated in recent decades. It is a text-terminal, mainframe-driven system; which is regarded as not very user-friendly, and hard to use compared with contemporary computer user-interfaces. In addition, it is written in its own programming language, TOPSTRAN (not strictly speaking a separate language but a set of IBM Assembler macros), and it is increasingly hard to find and train developers to maintain it. The division of British Rail and privatisation has also hurt TOPS, because it was not designed for that purpose; some freight operating companies do not keep information as up to date as they should. Attempts have been made to 'skin' the system with a more user-friendly interface, called TOPS 2000; in addition, there are other parallel systems now, such as TRUST, Genius and the Mobile Consisting Application (since 2019 marketed as part of the 3Squared RailSmart software suite), but none has yet fully supplanted the TOPS system.

He came to power in a coup d'état that deposed Isabel Martínez de Perón. In 1985, two years after the return of a representative democratic government, he was prosecuted in the Trial of the Juntas for large-scale human rights abuses and crimes against humanity that took place under his rule, including kidnappings or forced disappearance, widespread torture and extrajudicial murder of activists and political opponents as well as their families at secret concentration camps. An estimated 13,000 to 30,000 political dissidents vanished during this period. Videla was also convicted of the theft of many babies born during the captivity of their mothers at the illegal detention centres and passing them on for illegal adoption by associates of the regime. In his defence, Videla maintained the female guerrilla detainees allowed themselves to fall pregnant in the belief they wouldn't be tortured or executed. On 2010, Videla took full responsibility for his army's actions during his rule. \\"I accept the responsibility as the highest military authority during the internal war. My subordinates followed my orders,\\" he told an Argentine court. Videla also sheltered many Nazi fugitives as did Juan Perón before him, as Alfredo Stroessner did in Paraguay and as Hugo Banzer did in Bolivia. He was under house arrest until 2008, when he was sent to a military prison. Following a new trial, on 2010, Videla was sentenced to life in a civilian prison for the deaths of 31 prisoners following his coup.Life sentence for ex-Argentina leader on Al Jazeera English 2010 (video) On 5 July 2012, Videla was sentenced to 50 years in prison for the systematic kidnapping of children during his tenure.

He was the third of five sons born to Colonel Rafael Eugenio Videla Bengolea (1888–1951) and María Olga Redondo Ojea (1897–1987) and was christened in honor of his two older twin brothers, who had died of measles in 1923. Videla's family was a prominent one in San Luis Province, and many of his ancestors had held high public offices. His grandfather Jacinto had been governor of San Luis between 1891 and 1893, and his great-great-grandfather Blas Videla had fought in the Spanish American wars of independence and had later been a leader of the Unitarian Party in San Luis.Seoane-Muleiro: El Dictador. Ed. Sudamericana (2001). On 7 April 1948, Jorge Videla married Alicia Raquel Hartridge (born on 28 September 1927) daughter of Samuel Alejandro Hartridge Parkes (1891–1969), an English Argentine professor of physics and Argentine ambassador to Turkey, and María Isabel Lacoste Álvarez (1893–1939).Ronald Hilton, Who’s is Who in Latin America: Part V, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, Stanford University Press 1950, p. 103 They had seven children: María Cristina (1949), Jorge Horacio (1950), Alejandro Eugenio (1951–1971), María Isabel (1954), Pedro Ignacio (1956), Fernando Gabriel (1961) and Rafael Patricio (1963). Two of these, Rafael Patricio and Fernando Gabriel, joined the Argentine Army. Army career Videla joined the National Military College (Colegio Militar de la Nación) on 1942 and graduated on 1944 with the rank of second lieutenant. After steady promotion as a junior officer in the infantry, he attended the War College between 1952 and 1954 and graduated as a qualified staff officer. Videla served at the Ministry of Defence from 1958 to 1960 and thereafter he directed the Military Academy until 1962. In 1971, he was promoted to brigadier general and appointed by Alejandro Agustin Lanusse as Director of the National Military College. In late 1973 the head of the Army, Leandro Anaya, appointed Videla as the Chief of Staff of the Army. During July and , Videla was the Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Estado Mayor Conjunto) of the Argentine Armed Forces. In , the President, Isabel Perón, appointed Videla to the Army's senior position, the General Commander of the Army. { - Rank  Date of promotion - Second Lieutenant22 December 1944 - Lieutenant15 June 1947 - First Lieutenant3 November 1949 - Captain1 March 1952 - Major18 July 1958 - Lieutenant Colonel28 December 1961 - Colonel17 January 1966 - Brigadier General23 November 1971 - Lieutenant General20 October 1975 } Coup d'état Lieutenant General Jorge Rafael Videla swearing the Oath as President of Argentina, 29 March 1976.

A military junta was formed, made up of him, representing the Army; Admiral Emilio Massera representing the Navy; and Brigadier General Orlando Ramón Agosti representing the Air Force.Unlike most other countries, in the Armed Forces of Argentina, the Army rank of Lieutenant General (Teniente General), the Navy rank of Admiral (Almirante) and the Air Force rank of Brigadier General are equal and approximate to three-star or four-star ranks.

Videla narrowly escaped three assassination attempts by the Montoneros and ERP between February 1976 and April 1977. Justice Minister Ricardo Gil Lavedra, who formed part of the 1985 tribunal judging the military crimes committed during the Dirty War, later declared, \\"I sincerely believe that the majority of the victims of the illegal repression were guerrilla militants\\".Amar al enemigo, Javier Vigo Leguizamón, p. 68, Ediciones Pasco, 2001 Some 10,000 of the disappeared were guerrillas of the Montoneros, and the People's Revolutionary Army.

In the book Disposición Final by Argentine journalist Ceferino Reato, Videla confirms for the first time that between 1976 and 1983, 8.000 Argentines have been murdered by his regime. The bodies were hidden or destroyed to prevent protests at home and abroad. \\"Oud-dictator Videla: onder mijn bewind duizenden mensen vermoord,\\" Volkskrant (14 April 2012) Videla also maintained that female guerrilla detainees allowed themselves to become pregnant in the belief they wouldn't be tortured or executed, but they were. The children whom they bore in prison were taken from them, illegally adopted by military families of the regime, and their identities were hidden for decades. According to Human rights organisations in Argentina, between 1,900 and 3,000 Jews were among the 30,000 who were targeted by the Argentine military junta. It is a disproportionate number, as Jews comprised between 5–12% of those targeted but only 1% of the population. Historian Daniel Muchnik attributed this to many Jews gravitating to political activism and armed resistance groups such as the ERP and FAP during the period. However, testimonies from Jewish Argentines suggest that they were targeted for being Jewish. Many torture victims were said to have seen pictures of Adolf Hitler and swastikas on walls of torture chambers and interrogators uttering anti- Semitic epithets. Jews were also known to have suffered anti-Semitic harassment while in the Argentine military. Between 200 and 300 Jews were subject to attacks, often by their superiors. Some 11,000 Argentines have applied for and received up to US$200,000 as monetary compensation from the state for the loss of loved ones during the military dictatorship.State terrorism in Latin America: Chile, Argentina, and international human, Thomas C.

Foreign relations Videla met with US President Jimmy Carter at the White House in 9 September 1977. The coup d'état had been planned since October 1975, and the United States Department of State learned of the preparations two months before its execution. Henry Kissinger would meet several times with Argentine Armed Forces leaders after the coup, urging them to destroy their opponents quickly before outcry over human rights abuses grew in the United States. The US State Department saw Argentina as a bulwark of anti-communism in South America and in early April 1976, the US Congress approved a request by the Ford Administration, written by Henry Kissinger, to grant $50,000,000 in security assistance to the junta. In 1977 and 1978 the United States sold more than $120,000,000 in spare military parts to Argentina, and in 1977 the US Department of Defense granted $700,000 to train 217 Argentine military officers.On 30th Anniversary of Argentine Coup: New Declassified Details on Repression and U.S. Support for Military Dictatorship.

In 1978, however, Pope John Paul II opened a mediation process. His representative, Antonio Samoré, successfully prevented full-scale war. The conflict was not completely resolved until after Videla's time as president. Once the democratic rule was restored in 1983, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina (Tratado de Paz y Amistad), which acknowledged Chilean sovereignty over the islands, was signed and ratified by popular referendum. Public relations One of Videla's greatest challenges was his image abroad. He attributed criticism over human rights to an anti-Argentine campaign. On 19 May 1976, he attended a luncheon with a group of Argentine intellectuals, including Ernesto Sábato, Jorge Luis Borges, Horacio Esteban Ratti (president of the Argentine Writers Society) and Father Leonardo Castellani. The latter expressed him his concern regarding the disappearance of another writer, Haroldo Conti. On 30 April 1977, Azucena Villaflor, along with 13 other women, started demonstrations on the Plaza de Mayo, in front of the Casa Rosada presidential palace, demanding to be told the whereabouts of their disappeared children. They became known as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo (Madres de Plaza de Mayo). Bumper sticker commissioned by the junta in 1979. The text is a pun on derechos humanos, \\"human rights\\". \\"We argentines are righteous and humans\\" During a human rights investigation in , the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights denounced Videla's government, citing many disappearances and instances of abuse. In response, the junta hired the Burson-Marsteller ad agency to formulate a pithy comeback: Los argentinos somos derechos y humanos (Literally, \\"We the Argentines are righteous and humane\\"). The slogan was printed on 250,000 bumper stickers and distributed to motorists throughout Buenos Aires to create the appearance of a spontaneous support of pro-junta sentiment, at a cost of approximately $16,117., Clarin, 23 March 2006 Videla used the 1978 FIFA World Cup for political purposes.

In 1980 Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, leader of the Peace and Justice Service, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for reporting many of Argentina's human rights violations to the world at large. Later life and death Videla relinquished power to Roberto Viola on 1981; the military regime continued until it collapsed after losing the Falklands war in 1982. Democracy was restored in 1983. The new government began prosecution of top-ranking officers for crimes committed during the dictatorship in what was called the Trial of the Juntas of 1985. Videla was convicted of numerous homicides, kidnapping, torture, and many other crimes. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and was discharged from the military in 1985. Videla was imprisoned for five years. In 1990, President Carlos Menem pardoned Videla and many other imprisoned former members of the military regime. Menem also pardoned the leftist guerrilla commanders accused of terrorism. In a televised address to the nation, President Menem said, \\"I have signed the decrees so we may begin to rebuild the country in peace, in liberty and in justice ... We come from long and cruel confrontations. There was a wound to heal.\\"\\"Pardon of Argentine Officers Angers Critics of the Military\\", The New York Times, 9 October 1989 Videla briefly returned to prison in 1998 when a judge found him guilty of the kidnapping of babies during the Dirty War, including the child of the desaparecida Silvia Quintela, and the disappearances of the commanders of the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP), Mario Roberto Santucho and Benito Urteaga. Videla spent 38 days in the old part of the Caseros Prison. Due to health issues, he was later transferred to house arrest. Following the election of President Néstor Kirchner in 2003, there was a renewed widespread effort in Argentina to show the illegality of Videla's rule. The government no longer recognized Videla as having been a legal president of the country, and his portrait was removed from the military school. In 2003, Congress repealed the Ley de Punto Final, which had ended prosecutions for crimes under the dictatorship. In 2005, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled that the law had been unconstitutional. The government re-opened prosecution of crimes against humanity. On 6 September 2006, Judge Norberto Oyarbide ruled that the pardons granted by President Menem were unconstitutional. On 2007, a federal court struck down Videla's presidential pardon and restored his convictions for human rights abuses. He was put on trial on 2010 for new charges of human rights violations relating to the deaths of 31 prisoners who died under his rule. Three days later, Videla took full responsibility for his army's actions during his rule, saying, \\"I accept the responsibility as the highest military authority during the internal war. My subordinates followed my orders.\\" On 2010, the trial ended, and Videla was convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He was ordered to be transferred to a civilian prison immediately after the trial. In handing down the sentence, judge María Elba Martínez said that Videla was \\"a manifestation of state terrorism.\\" During the trial, Videla had said that \\"yesterday's enemies are in power and from there, they are trying to establish a Marxist regime\\" in Argentina. On 5 July 2012, Videla was convicted and sentenced to 50 years' imprisonment for his participation in a scheme to steal babies from parents detained by the military regime. According to the court decision, Videla was an accomplice \\"in the crimes of theft, retention and hiding of minors, as well as replacing their identities.\\" The children were given to military families for illegal adoption, and their identities were hidden. An estimated 400 children were stolen during this period, often from mothers who gave birth in prison and who were later \\"disappeared.\\" By june of 2019, 130 of these adoptees had their identities restored.https://www.pagina12.com.ar/200102-abuelas-presento-al-nieto-130 On 17 May 2013, Videla was reported as having died of natural causes in his sleep while serving his sentence at a Marcos Paz prison.

A private ceremony was held by his family. Human rights organizations throughout the political compass denounced Videla, saying that he died without admitting that he was aware of the disappeared persons and kidnapped children. None of the tried ex-officers has provided details about the fate of those missing. Videla appeared mostly unrepentant for the actions against those whom he deemed terrorist subversives., Agence-France Presse Several Argentine politicians commented on his death. Deputy Ricardo Gil Lavedra of the Radical Civic Union said that Videla will be remembered as a dictator, while Hermes Binner expressed condolences to the victims of his government. Hernán Lombardi, Minister of Culture of Buenos Aires city, praised Argentine democracy for having tried and sentenced the dictator. Ricardo Alfonsín said it was good that Videla had died in prison. Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, Argentine recipient of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize, said, \\"The death of Videla should not delight anybody, we have to keep working for a better society, more just, more humane, so that all that horror never happens again\\". Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers Juan Manuel Abal Medina, Jr. said that he was glad that, \\"Videla died prosecuted, sentenced and imprisoned in a common cell, repudiated by the Argentine people\\".

After Morgan announced his intention to publish a book exposing Freemasonry's secrets, he was arrested on trumped-up charges. He disappeared soon after, and was believed to have been kidnapped and killed by Masons from western New York. The allegations surrounding Morgan's disappearance and presumed death sparked a public outcry and inspired Thurlow Weed and others to harness the discontent by founding the new Anti-Masonic Party in opposition to President Andrew Jackson's Democrats. It ran a presidential candidate in 1832 but was nearly defunct by 1835.The History Channel, Mysteries of the Freemasons: America, video documentary, 1 August 2006, written by Noah Nicholas and Molly Bedell  Early life and education  Morgan was born in Culpeper, Virginia, in 1774. His birth date is sometimes given as August 7, but no definite source for this is cited. He worked as a bricklayer and stone cutter, and later used his savings to open a store in Richmond.The Proceedings of the United States Antimasonic Convention, Held at Philadelphia, September 11, 1830.

Trimble, Philadelphia et al. 1830. 164 pp. Military service Morgan told friends and acquaintances that he had served with distinction as a captain during the War of 1812, and his associates in upstate New York appear to have accepted this claim. Several men named William Morgan appear in the Virginia militia rolls for this period, but none held the rank of captain, and whether Morgan actually served in the war has not been determined with certainty. Marriage and family In October 1819, when he was in his mid-40s, Morgan married 19-year-oldCompton, Todd (1997), In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith, Salt Lake City: Signature Books, p.44, 52. Lucinda Pendleton in Richmond, Virginia. They had two children: Lucinda Wesley Morgan and Thomas Jefferson Morgan. Two years after his marriage, Morgan moved his family to York, Upper Canada, where he operated a brewery. When his business was destroyed in a mysterious fire, Morgan was reduced to poverty. He returned with his family to the United States, settling first at Rochester, New York, and later in Batavia, where he again worked as a bricklayer and stonecutter. Nineteenth-century local histories described Morgan as a heavy drinker and a gambler, Tillotson, Lee S.; Ancient Craft Masonry in Vermont, Vermont Freemasons, Online version characterizations disputed by Morgan's friends and supporters.  Book on Freemasonry  Morgan claimed to have been made a Master Mason while he was living in Canada, and he appears to have briefly attended a lodge in Rochester. In 1825 Morgan received the Royal Arch degree at Le Roy's Western Star Chapter #33, having declared under oath that he had previously received the six degrees that preceded it. It has never been established if he actually received these degrees and if so from which lodge. Morgan then attempted unsuccessfully to help establish or visit lodges and chapters in Batavia, but he was denied participation by members who disapproved of his character and even questioned his claims to Masonic membership. This angered Morgan, who finally announced that he was going to publish an exposé titled Illustrations of Masonry, critical of the Freemasons and revealing their secret degree work in detail. Morgan announced that a local newspaper publisher, David Cade Miller, had given him a sizable advance for the work. Miller is said to have received the entered apprentice degree (the first degree of Freemasonry), but had been stopped from advancement by the objection of Batavia lodge members. Morgan was promised one-fourth of the profits, and the financial backers of the venture—Miller, John Davids (Morgan's landlord), and Russel Dyer—entered into a $500,000 penal bond with Morgan to guarantee its publication.  Disappearance  Since Masons place their hands on a Bible and promise not to reveal the passwords and grips of the degrees, several members of the Batavia lodge published an advertisement denouncing Morgan for breaking his word by authoring the book. An attempt was also made to set fire to Miller's newspaper office and print shop. On September 11, 1826, Morgan was arrested for supposed nonpayment of a loan and allegedly stealing a shirt and a tie; according to the laws of the time he could be held in debtors' prison until restitution was made, which would have made it more difficult to publish his book. Morgan was jailed in Canandaigua, and when Miller learned of this, he went to the jail to pay the debt and secure Morgan's release. Morgan was released, but then re- arrested and charged with supposedly failing to pay a two dollar tavern bill. While the jailer was away, a group of men convinced his wife to release Morgan; they walked to a waiting carriage, which arrived two days later at Fort Niagara. Shortly afterwards, Morgan disappeared. There are conflicting accounts of what happened next. The generally accepted version of events is that Morgan was taken in a boat to the middle of the Niagara River and thrown overboard, where he presumably drowned, since he was never seen again in the community.\\"Captain William M. Morgan of Batavia New York\\", Christian Martyrs Another version of events had Morgan being paid a large sum of money to simply \\"disappear\\" and give up publication of his book. In 1848 Henry L.

In October 1827, a badly decomposed body washed up on the shores of Lake Ontario. Many presumed it to be Morgan, and the body was buried as his. However, the wife of a missing Canadian named Timothy Monroe (or Munro) positively identified the clothing on the body as that which had been worn by her husband at the time he had disappeared.Clyde R. Forsberg, Jr., Equal Rites: The Book of Mormon, Masonry, Gender, and American Culture, New York: Columbia University Press, Preface xv.“William Morgan's Bones; A Skeleton Found in a Quarry in Genesee County” The New York Times, June 22, 1881. Retrieved 2011-07-07. One group of Freemasons denied that Morgan was killed, saying they had paid him $500 to leave the country. Morgan was reportedly seen later, including in other countries, but none of the reports were confirmed. Eventually, Eli Bruce, the sheriff of Niagara County and a Mason, was removed from office and tried for his involvement in Morgan's disappearance; he served 28 months in prison after being convicted of conspiracy for his role in kidnapping Morgan and holding him against his will before his disappearance. Three other Masons, Loton Lawson, Nicholas Chesebro and Edward Sawyer, were convicted of taking part in the kidnapping, and served sentences.Ridley, Jasper; The Freemasons: A History of the World's Most Powerful Secret Society, pp. 180-181 (Arcade Publishing 1999). Other Batavia Masons were tried and acquitted. Author Jasper Ridley suggests that Morgan was probably killed by local Masons, as all other scenarios are highly improbable. Historian H. Paul Jeffers also considers this the more credible explanation.Jeffers, Henry Paul, Freemasons: A History and Exploration of the World's Oldest Secret Society, p. 85, Citadel Press, 2005. C. T. Congdon, in Reminiscences of a Journalist, cites a third-hand account \\"that Morgan was murdered by certain very zealous Freemasons,\\" and notes that the resultant anti-Mason sentiment caused many elections to go to non-Masons for a number of years afterwards.Congdon, C.T., Reminiscences of a Journalist, pp. 28-30, James R. Osgood & Co., 1880.  Aftermath: the anti-Masonic movement  Soon after Morgan disappeared, Miller published Morgan's book, which became a bestseller because of the notoriety of the events surrounding his disappearance. Miller did not say that Morgan had been murdered but that he had been \\"carried away\\". Accounts circulated of Morgan having assumed a new identity and settled in Albany, Canada, or the Cayman Islands, where he was said to have been hanged as a pirate. New York governor DeWitt Clinton, also a Mason, offered a $1,000 reward for information about Morgan's whereabouts, but it was never claimed. The circumstances of Morgan's disappearance and the minimal punishment received by his kidnappers caused public outrage, and he became a symbol of the rights of free speech and free press. Protests against Freemasons took place in New York and the neighboring states; Masonic officials disavowed the actions of the kidnappers, but all Masons were under a cloud of suspicion. Thurlow Weed, a New York politician, gathered discontented opponents of President Andrew Jackson, a Mason, into the Anti-Masonic Party, which gained the support of such notable politicians as William H. Seward and Millard Fillmore. In the 1828 campaign other Jackson rivals, including John Quincy Adams, joined in denouncing the Masons. In 1832, the Anti-Masonic Party fielded William Wirt as its presidential candidate and Amos Ellmaker as his running mate, and they received the seven electoral votes from Vermont. By 1835, the party had become moribund everywhere but Pennsylvania, as other issues, such as slavery, became the focus of national attention. In 1847 Adams published a widely distributed book titled Letters on the Masonic Institution that criticized the Masons' secret society.John Quincy Adams, Letters on the Masonic Institution, Press of T.R. Marvin, 1847. Members of Freemasonry criticized the Mormons for their adoption of Masonic rituals and regalia. In 1830 Morgan's widow, Lucinda Pendleton Morgan, married George W. Harris of Batavia, a silversmith who was 20 years older. After they moved to the Midwest, they became Mormons. By 1837, some historians believe that Lucinda Pendleton Morgan Harris had become one of the plural wives of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement.Compton, Todd (1997), In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith, Salt Lake City: Signature Books She continued to live with George Harris. After Smith was murdered in 1844, she was \\"sealed\\" to him for eternity in a rite of the church. By 1850 the Harrises had separated. When George Harris died in 1860, he had been excommunicated from the Mormons after ceasing to practice with them. That year Lucinda Morgan Harris was reported to have joined the Catholic Sisters of Charity in Memphis, Tennessee, where she worked at the Leah Asylum. She had been widowed three times. In 1841 the Mormons announced their vicarious baptism of William Morgan after his death, as one of the first under their new rite to posthumously offer people entrance into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. In June, 1881 a grave was discovered in a quarry two miles south of the Indian reservation in Pembroke, New York. In it were bones and a metal tobacco box. Other items found included a ring with the inscribed initials \\"W. M.\\" The box contained a crumpled paper; its few legible words seemed to suggest that the remains might have been Morgan's. There were also critics who suggested that the alleged discovery of the bones and other artifacts was intentionally timed to coincide with the effort to construct a memorial to Morgan, and might have been an effort to generate publicity for the monument, which was in fact dedicated in 1882.  Monument to Morgan  William Morgan Pillar, April 2011 On September 13, 1882, the National Christian Association, a group opposed to secret societies, commissioned and erected a statue in memoriam to Morgan in the Batavia Cemetery, where Timothy Monroe's body had been buried. The ceremony was witnessed by 1,000 people, including representatives from local Masonic lodges.\\"An Old Tragedy Revived; Erection Of A Memorial To Morgan, Who Divulged The Secrets Of Masonry\\", The New York Times, 14 September 1882, p. 1.\\"Morgan's Monument: The Unveiling Ceremonies Witnessed by a Large Crowd Who Listen to Able and Interesting Addresses Substance of the Speeches Proceedings at the Convention A Letter from Thurlow Weed\\", The Daily News, Batavia (NY), 14 September 1882. Retrieved 2011-07-07. The monument reads: > Sacred to the memory of Wm. Morgan, a native of Virginia, a Capt. in the War > of 1812, a respectable citizen of Batavia, and a martyr to the freedom of > writing, printing and speaking the truth.

Representation in other media The pharmacist John Uri Lloyd based part of the background story of his popular scientific allegorical novel Etidorhpa (1895) on the kidnapping of William Morgan and the start of the Anti-Masonry movement. In his novel The Craft: Freemasons, Secret Agents, and William Morgan (2010), the author Thomas Talbot presents a fictional version of the William Morgan kidnapping. He portrays him as a British spy, includes rogue British Masons, and has presidential agents thwart an assassination plot.

K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, magic is depicted as a supernatural force that can be used to override the usual laws of nature. Many fictional magical creatures exist in the series, while ordinary creatures also sometimes exhibit magical properties. Magical objects are also described. The small number of humans who are able to perform magic (witches and wizards) refer to the rest of the population, oblivious to the existence of magic, as \\"Muggles\\" in the United Kingdom and \\"No-Maj\\" in the United States. In humans, magic or the lack thereof is an inborn attribute. It is inherited, carried on \\"dominant resilient genes\\". Magic is the norm for the children of magical couples and less common in those of Muggles. Exceptions exist: those unable to do magic who are born to magical parents are known as Squibs, whereas a witch or wizard born to Muggle parents is known as a Muggle-born, or by the derogatory term \\"Mudblood\\". While Muggle-borns are quite common, Squibs are extremely rare. Rowling based many magical elements of the Harry Potter universe on real-world mythology and magic. She has described this as \\"a way of giving texture to the world\\". The books present the idea that the Muggle interpretation of these stories is a distorted version of what goes on in the wizarding world. The magic of Harry Potter became the subject of a 2017 British Library exhibition and accompanying documentary. The exhibition, entitled Harry Potter: A History of Magic, is the first at the British Library to be inspired by a single series by a living author. Using magic Witches and wizards train to learn how to control their magic. With young and untrained children, magic will manifest itself subconsciously in moments of strong apprehension, fear, anger and sadness. For example, Harry Potter once made his hair grow back after a bad haircut, set a boa constrictor on his cousin Dudley at the London Zoo, and made Aunt Marge inflate to an enormous size. While this reaction is usually uncontrollable, as an untrained child, Lord Voldemort was able to make things move without touching them, make animals do what he wanted without training them, make \\"bad things happen\\" to people who annoyed him, or make them hurt if he wanted to., chapter 13 In addition, Lily Potter was able to guide and control the blooming of a flower by wanting to. Almost all magic is done with the use of a wand. On the subject of wandless magic, Rowling says: A wizard or witch is only at their best when using their own wand. When using another's wand, one's spells are not as strong as they normally would be. Within the books, technical details of magic are obscure. Of Harry's lessons, only those involving magical beasts magical creatures, potions or divination are given in any detail. Severus Snape once told Harry Potter that \\"Time and space matter in magic\\" during Harry's first Occlumency lesson in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Albus Dumbledore told Harry after finding the magically concealed boat to reach the locket Horcrux that \\"Magic always leaves traces, sometimes very distinctive traces.\\"  Spellcasting  Spells are the every- purpose tools of a wizard or witch; short bursts of magic used to accomplish single specialised tasks such as opening locks or creating fire. Typically casting requires an incantation, most often in a modified form of Latin (see Dog Latin), and gesturing with a wand. However, Rowling has revealed that particularly talented wizards can cast spells without the aid of wand, although magic produced with one is generally more precise and powerful. Spells can also be cast non-verbally, but with a magical wand. This special technique is taught in the sixth year of study at Hogwarts and requires the caster to concentrate on the incantation. Some spells (e.g., Levicorpus) are apparently designed to be used non-verbally. While most magic shown in the books requires the caster to use their voice, some do not (and this may depend on the witch or wizard). Dumbledore has been known to do impressive feats of magic without speaking, such as conjuring enough squashy purple sleeping bags to accommodate the entire student population or during his duel with Voldemort towards the end of Order of the Phoenix. It is possible to use a wand without holding it. In Order of the Phoenix, Harry himself performs Lumos to light his wand when it is lying on the ground somewhere near him. Additionally, Animagi and Metamorphmagi do not need wands to undergo their transformations. Spells are divided into rough categories, such as \\"charms\\", \\"curses\\", \\"hexes\\", or \\"jinxes\\". Although offensive and potentially dangerous curses exist in number, three are considered usable only for great evil, which earns them the special classification of \\"Unforgivable Curses\\".  The limits of magic  Before publishing the first Harry Potter novel, Rowling spent five years establishing the limitations of magic—determining what it could and could not do. \\"The most important thing to decide when you're creating a fantasy world,\\" she said in 2000, \\"is what the characters can't do.\\" For instance, while it is possible to conjure things out of thin air, it is far more tricky to create something that fits an exact specification rather than a general one; moreover, any objects so conjured tend not to last. Death Rowling has described death as the most important theme in the books. Consequently, as Dumbledore states in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, there is no spell that can truly bring the dead back to life. While corpses can be transformed into obedient Inferi on a living wizard's command, they are little more than zombies with no soul or will of their own. However, there are some methods of communicating with the dead, though with limited results. For example, all Hogwarts headmasters appear in a portrait when they die, allowing consultation by future generations. It is also possible through the rare Priori Incantatem effect to converse with ghost-like \\"shadows\\" of magically murdered people. The Resurrection Stone also allows one to talk to the dead, but those brought back by the Stone are not corporeal, nor do they wish to be disturbed from their peaceful rest. Throughout the series, this limit is continually mentioned, and wizards try to transcend it at their own peril. Likewise, it is not possible to make oneself immortal unless one makes use of an object of great power to sustain life, such as the Philosopher's Stone or Horcruxes. If one were to possess the three Deathly Hallows, it is fabled that they would possess the tools to become the \\"master of death\\". However, it is hinted that to be a true \\"master of death\\" is to be willing to accept that death is inevitable. Other methods of extending life include drinking unicorn blood, which will keep a person alive even if death is imminent, but at the terrible price of being cursed forever. Being magical can contribute to one's longevity, as there are several characters in the series who are unusually long-lived (such as Griselda Marchbanks, who was an invigilator during Albus Dumbledore's O.W.L examinations). It is revealed by Nearly Headless Nick in the fifth book that all witches and wizards have the choice of becoming ghosts upon dying; however, it is described as \\"a pale imitation of life\\". Snape states that a ghost is merely \\"the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth\\". Death is studied at the Department of Mysteries in a chamber containing an enigmatic veil, which Rowling has described as \\"the divide between life and death\\". With regard to what is on the other side, she elaborated: \\"Do I believe you go on? Yes, I do believe you go on. I do believe in an afterlife, although I'm absolutely doubt-ridden and always have been but there you are.\\" Sirius falls through this veil in Order of the Phoenix after he is hit with a curse from Bellatrix. Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration The Principal Exceptions to Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration is a magical theory mentioned by Hermione and later repeated by Ron in the final book. She explains that food is one of these: witches or wizards can cook and prepare food using magic, and even multiply it, but not create it out of nothing. There are numerous examples in the series of food appearing to have been conjured from nothing, such as the sudden materialisation of ingredients in the pots of Molly Weasley's kitchen and when Professor McGonagall creates a self-refilling plate of sandwiches for Harry and Ron in Chamber of Secrets. In all cases, these events can be reasonably explained as food either being multiplied or transported from elsewhere. One example of the latter is banqueting at Hogwarts—the food is prepared by elves in the kitchens and laid onto four replica tables, directly below the actual house tables in the Great Hall. The food is then magically transported to the tables. This is the only exception mentioned explicitly in the series. However, Rowling herself has stated once in an interview that money is something wizards cannot simply materialise out of thin air, or the economic system of the wizarding world would then be gravely flawed and disrupted. While the Philosopher's Stone does permit alchemy, this is portrayed as an extremely rare, even unique, object, whose owner does not exploit its powers. Emotion As explained earlier, young untrained wizards can trigger uncontrolled magic when they are in the state of heightened emotions. But emotions also affect trained witches and wizards and their magical abilities. For instance, in Half-Blood Prince, a heartbroken Nymphadora Tonks temporarily loses her power as a Metamorphmagus when Remus Lupin starts distancing himself from her. The form of her Patronus changes to reflect her depression. Another example is Merope Gaunt, who only demonstrated any magical ability when removed from her father's oppression, but then lost it again when her husband abandoned her. Several magical spells require the use of certain emotions when casting them. The Patronus charm, for example, requires the caster to concentrate on a happy memory. (Force of will, under extenuating circumstances, helps a lot. An example of this is when Harry is able to conjure a corporeal Patronus when Sirius is in danger of being administered the Dementor's Kiss.) Another example is the Cruciatus Curse, which causes immense pain; as Harry discovers during a duel with Bellatrix Lestrange, effective use of this forbidden dark magic requires sadistic desires. Love (in its broadest meaning) is depicted as a particularly powerful form of magic. According to Dumbledore, love is a \\"force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death, than human intelligence, than forces of nature.\\" Lily's voluntary sacrifice on Harry's behalf saves him from Voldemort as a baby, and Harry makes a similar sacrifice to save his friends at the end of Deathly Hallows. A certain key prophecy in the series describes Harry as having \\"power the Dark Lord knows not\\", referencing his capacity for love. True love is impossible to create magically; Amortentia, a love potion, can only create a powerful sense of infatuation and obsession. Magical abilities The following is a list of special abilities that a wizard or witch in the Harry Potter universe may have.  Animagi  An Animagus (portmanteau of animal and magus) is a witch or wizard who can turn into a particular animal or magical creature at will. This ability is not innate: it must be acquired by magical means. All Animagi must register at a central authority by law, though a number of characters are revealed over the course of the series to have remained unregistered illegally: James Potter, Sirius Black, Peter Pettigrew and Rita Skeeter. Animagi transformation can be performed wandlessly. Sirius and Peter are left wandless for over 10 years, but both retain the ability with no apparent ill effects. When Animagi transform, they take on the appearance of a normal animal. However, in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, it is noted that Ron's pet rat Scabbers (later revealed as Peter Pettigrew's Animagus form) has lived over twelve years when only expected to live three. Also, an Animagus in animal form retains the ability to think like a human, which is the principal difference between being an animagus and being transfigured into an animal. Otherwise, they would forget that they were a wizard and be trapped, unknowingly, in this form unless transformed back by another wizard. Characteristics of an Animagus' human form can manifest themselves in the animal transformation; for example, the markings around McGonagall's eyes as a cat resemble her glasses. When an Animagus registers, they must record all the defining physical traits of their animal form so that the Ministry can identify them. Each Animagus has a specific animal form, and cannot transform into any other animal. The animal cannot be chosen: it is uniquely suited to that individual's personality, and in most cases the Animagus will change into the same animal used in the person's Patronus Charm. Explicit emphasis is placed in the books on the differences between Animagi and werewolves. Animagi have full control over their transformations and retain their minds, whereas werewolves' transformations are involuntary and include severe changes in personality. After the person has transformed into a werewolf \\"...he no longer remembers who he is. He'd kill his best friend. The werewolf only responds to the call of his own kind.\\" The only way that a werewolf can retain his sanity, intelligence and memory while transformed is using the Wolfsbane Potion. Metamorphmagi A Metamorphmagus (a portmanteau of metamorph and magus) is a witch or wizard born with the innate ability to change some or all of their appearance at will. The talent cannot be acquired; a witch or wizard who has it must be born with it. Nymphadora Tonks and her son, Teddy Lupin are currently the only known Metamorphmagi in the series; it is a very rare ability, possibly hereditary. Tonks is known to change her hair colour and style according to her mood. She even appears as an old woman on occasion. She can also change her nose appearance, as she does when eating with the Weasley family to entertain Ginny and Hermione. Her son, Teddy Lupin, also inherited this trait, as his hair is mentioned repeatedly changing colour. The extent of these appearance-altering abilities and the limits thereof are not entirely clear. According to Rowling, a Metamorphmagus can alter his or her appearance completely, for instance, from black to white, young to old, handsome to plain and so on. In one example, Tonks changes her facial appearance by reshaping her nose into \\"a beaklike protuberance like Snape's\\", to \\"something resembling a button mushroom\\", and \\"one like a pig snout\\" which reminded Harry of his cousin Dudley.Rowling, J.K.: \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\", page 85. Scholastic, 2003 The emotional state of a Metamorphmagus can affect their abilities. Parseltongue Parseltongue is the language of snakes. It is often associated with Dark Magic, although Dumbledore stated that it is not necessarily an evil quality. Those possessing the ability to speak it (\\"Parselmouths\\") occur very rarely. People apparently acquire the skill through learning or via a method of xenoglossia, such as through genetic inheritance (or by use of Dark or dangerous Magic). Harry was a Parselmouth until the age of 17. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets explains this was because of Voldemort's passing on some of his abilities to Harry the night he tried to kill him. Deathly Hallows reveals that a part of Voldemort's soul within Harry grants him this ability, which is later destroyed leaving Harry stripped of the ability. Harry temporarily regains the ability in The Cursed Child, along with a pain in the scar. Other known Parselmouths include Salazar Slytherin and his descendants, including the Gaunts and Voldemort. Dumbledore can also understand Parseltongue; however, he learned it and did not naturally possess the ability. In Half-Blood Prince, he repeats Morfin Gaunt's words \\"the big house over the way\\", which were spoken in Parseltongue. Ron uses Parseltongue in the final book to reopen the Chamber of Secrets, but he is only imitating the sound of a phrase Harry used earlier in the book. Rowling borrowed the term from \\"an old word for someone who has a problem with the mouth, like a hare lip\\". Seers A Seer is a witch or wizard with the clairvoyant ability to predict future events. The predictions given through this ability can sometimes be self-fulfilling prophecies, and Dumbledore states in Order of the Phoenix that not all of them come true, depending on the choices made by those mentioned. This would seem to indicate that a Seer predicts possible or likely events, at least in some cases. In the Hall of Prophecy at the Department of Mysteries, thousands upon thousands of glass spheres are imbued with records of prophecies made by Seers. Only a person mentioned in a prophecy can safely retrieve it; anyone else who tries to do so will be driven insane. According to McGonagall, true Seers are extremely rare. Sybill Trelawney is the only Seer portrayed in the books, and is considered an \\"old fraud\\" by her students -- although it is mentioned that Sybill's great- great-grandmother, Cassandra Trelawney, was a renowned Seer in her day. Trelawney is ultimately sacked by Dolores Umbridge in the fifth book for her lack of ability. She has, however, twice made true prophecies -- both of significance to Harry Potter -- but had no recollection of either prediction afterward. Legilimency and Occlumency Legilimency is the magical skill of extracting feelings and memories from another person's mind—a form of magical \\"telepathy\\" (although Snape, an able practitioner of the art, dismisses the colloquial term \\"mind-reading\\", as a drastic oversimplification). It also allows one to convey visions or memories to another person, whether real or imaginary. A witch or wizard possessing this skill is called a Legilimens, and can, for example, detect lies and deceit in another person, witness memories in another person's past, or \\"plant\\" false visions in another's mind. The counter-skill to Legilimency is Occlumency (and its user, known as an Occlumens), by which one can compartmentalize one's emotions, or prevent a Legilimens from discovering thoughts or memories which contradict one's spoken words or actions. An advanced form of Occlumency is planting false temporary memories inside an Occlumens' own head while blocking all other true memories, so if a Legilimens, even a highly skilled one, were to attempt to read the mind, he or she would find false memories only and believe everything was right. The skills are first mentioned in Order of the Phoenix. Legilimency and Occlumency are not part of the normal curriculum at Hogwarts, and most students would graduate without learning them. Voldemort, Snape, and Dumbledore are all skilled in Legilimency and Occlumency, albeit with the use of their wands. Voldemort is said to be the master of Legilimency by Snape, as he, in almost all cases, immediately knows if someone lied to him. In addition, in Deathly Hallows, Voldemort repeatedly uses Legilimency to interrogate his victims. Voldemort practices Occlumency throughout the period of Half-Blood Prince to deny Harry access to his thoughts and emotions. However, in Deathly Hallows, Voldemort repeatedly loses grip, resulting in occasional but very powerful burst of thoughts, visions and emotions to be sent to Harry. Throughout the books, Snape is repeatedly said to be highly skilled in Occlumency,Prince, Alan (2011). The True Story of Severus Snape: An Essay About Harry Potter's Most Disputed Character, p. 52. explaining how he was able to deceive Voldemort for years. Even before Order of the Phoenix, Harry has the impression that Snape can read minds. During the Order of Phoenix Snape is instructed by Dumbledore to give Harry lessons in Occlumency. Due to the antagonism between the two, and Harry's secret desire to know Voldemort's thoughts, he makes poor progress, and only once manages to overcome Snape and enter his mind., chapter 26 In Deathly Hallows, Harry finally masters Occlumency—shutting his mind to Voldemort—when Dobby dies. He realises that his grief—or as Dumbledore calls it, love—is what can block out the Dark Lord. Queenie Goldstein, in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, is revealed to be a proficient Legilimens, born with the ability, as she is able to read the minds of Jacob Kowalski and others in the film, as well as sense and hear them from afar through their thoughts and emotions. Unlike Snape, Voldemort and Dumbledore however, she does not require a wand to cast the spells of Legilimency as the ability to read minds comes naturally to her. Apparition and Disapparition Apparition is a magical form of teleportation, through which a witch or wizard can disappear (\\"Disapparate\\") from one location and reappear (\\"Apparate\\") in another. It is sometimes accompanied by a distinctive cracking or popping sound, though the more skilled wizards such as Dumbledore can Apparate \\"so suddenly and silently\\" that they seem to have \\"popped out of the ground\\". According to Harry, apparition is also accompanied by a very unpleasant squeezing sensation, as though being sent through a tight rubber tube. The Ministry of Magic licenses Apparition. A witch or wizard must be 17 years old or older and have a licence to Apparate as a means of transportation in much the same way real-world governments require individuals to have a licence to drive a motor vehicle. Students at Hogwarts may attend Ministry-administered Apparition lessons during their sixth year, and take their examination once they turn seventeen. It is shown that although it is possible to Apparate without a licence, it is not usually done (unless in lessons) and is illegal. In Deathly Hallows, Harry does not possess a licence, but since his Trace has been lifted, the Ministry is likely unaware that he does it. Learning to Apparate is difficult, and students run the risk of splinching—being physically split between the origin and destination—which requires the assistance of the Ministry's Accidental Magic Reversal Squad to undo properly, although essence of dittany can also mend certain wounds. Splinching is quite common during lessons, and can be uncomfortable (and at times rather gruesome) depending on the body parts splinched, but is ultimately harmless if properly reversed. Although Ron can Apparate, he isn't terribly skilled at it, and splinches himself at least three times (once losing half an eyebrow, two fingernails and part of his arm). Harry and Hermione both pick up the skill quickly in comparison. As explained in the Half-Blood Prince, there is no word spell to Apparate or Disapparate, but the caster has to concentrate on the location on which he has to apparate, needs to be fully focused on the spell, and also has to \\"feel\\" it through the whole body. It has been indicated that it is considered rude to Apparate directly into a private area, such as a home. Dumbledore states in Half-Blood Prince that it would be \\"quite as rude as kicking down the front door\\". For this reason, and for reasons of security, many homes have Anti- Apparition spells protecting them from uninvited intrusions. The accepted way to travel to a home is to Apparate to a nearby location and continue to the final destination on foot. Apparition is considered unreliable over long distances, and even experienced users of the technique sometimes prefer other means of transport, such as broomsticks. Rowling has stated that Apparating over long distances depends on the skill of the wizard, and \\"Cross-continental Apparition would almost certainly result in severe injury or death.\\" Indeed, even the prodigiously skilled Lord Voldemort elects to fly back to England after visiting the far-flung Nurmengard. For reasons of security, the grounds and buildings of Hogwarts are protected by ancient Anti-Apparition and Anti- Disapparition spells, which prevent humans from Apparating on the school grounds. There is also a spell that prevents individuals from Disapparating, which Dumbledore places on the Death Eaters captured at the Ministry in Order of the Phoenix; a sister spell, which allows one to Apparate into a location but prevents them from Disapparating out of it, is cast by the Death Eaters in Hogsmeade in concordance with the Caterwauling Charm. Dumbledore is the only person who can both Apparate and Disapparate from the school grounds, since he is the headmaster. A witch or wizard can use Side-Along Apparition to take others with them during Apparition. Dumbledore successfully transports Harry this way several times in Half-Blood Prince, and Harry's first non-lesson attempt at the skill is the Side-Along Apparition with the weakened Dumbledore when they return from the seaside cave. In the Order of the Phoenix film, Death Eaters and Order members Apparate and Disapparate in clouds of black and white smoke respectively. In the film, both sides also appear to be able to \\"half-apparate\\" in which their bodies were made out of smoke, giving them the ability to fly. Both times Fred and George apparated and disapparated, they did it with a pop as in the books. In the books, the words \\"Apparate\\" and \\"Disapparate\\", like many other neologisms used by Rowling, are capitalised, whereas established English words such as \\"jinx\\" and \\"hex\\" are not. The words themselves are most likely derived from the French apparaître and disparaître, meaning 'to appear' and 'to disappear'. Another possible derivation is from the English word \\"apparition\\", meaning \\"a supernatural appearance of a person or thing; anything that appears, especially something remarkable or startling; an act of appearing\\", which comes from the Latin \\"apparitio\\", meaning attendance. \\"Disapparate\\" probably comes from the same word but with the prefix \\"dis-\\" expressing negation or reversal. Other teleportation Some magical creatures have their own forms of instantaneous travel, such as a house elf's ability to teleport or a phoenix's ability to appear and disappear in a burst of flame. Unlike wizards, these creatures are not restricted by anti-Apparition magic. Dobby, Kreacher and the rest of the house-elf population can Apparate within the Hogwarts grounds, as they demonstrate on multiple occasions, most notably when Dobby visits Harry in the hospital wing, and when Harry summons Dobby and Kreacher and assigns them to tail Draco Malfoy. Fawkes disapparates from the headmaster's office at Hogwarts along with Dumbledore when the latter evades arrest at the hands of Ministry officials in Order of the Phoenix. Some magical devices like the Floo Network, Portkeys and Vanishing Cabinets also provide forms of magical teleportation. Veela charm An ability attributed to Veela and those of Veela heritage, such as Fleur Delacour, Veela charm is used to charm males, much as the Sirens do in The Odyssey. Men who are exposed to it over time become more resistant to it, although the Veela charm takes full effect if the Veela surprises the man, as noted by Ron in Half-Blood Prince. As shown in Goblet of Fire, one can use Veela hair as cores in magical wands. According to famed wandmaker Mr. Ollivander, these wands are a little \\"temperamental\\". Magical resistance This refers to a certain degree of immunity against hexes and spells found in powerful creatures such as trolls, dragons, and giants. Hagrid is resistant to certain spells, like the Stunning Spell, due to his giant blood. This type of resistance is not insurmountable; if enough Stunning Spells, for example, are fired at a creature with magical resistance at once, the creature may still be rendered unconscious. Also, wizards and witches can resist certain spells with the power of their own sheer will, such as Harry did in Goblet of Fire, when Barty Crouch Jr. disguised as Alastor Moody tried to control Harry with the Imperius curse and Harry resisted. Subjects at Hogwarts At Hogwarts, students must study a core group of subjects for the first two years, after which they must choose between several electives. During their final two years, students are permitted to take more specialized subjects such as Alchemy. Transfiguration, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Potions, Astronomy, History of Magic, and Herbology are compulsory subjects for the first five years, as well as flying lessons for the first year, which becomes optional for the remaining six years. At the end of their second year, students are required to add at least two optional subjects to their syllabus for the start of the third year. The five choices are Arithmancy, Muggle Studies, Divination, Study of Ancient Runes and Care of Magical Creatures. Very specialised subjects such as Alchemy are sometimes offered in the final two years, if there is sufficient demand. There is a total of twelve named Professors at Hogwarts, each specializing in one of these subjects. Transfiguration Transfiguration is essentially the art of changing the properties of an object.1998: Accio Quote!, the Largest Archive of J.K. Rowling quotes on the web, quick-quote.quill.org Transfiguration is a theory- based subject, including topics such as \\"Switching Spells\\" (altering only a part of some object, such as when Hagrid gave Dudley a pig tail); Vanishing Spells (causing an object to completely disappear); and Conjuring Spells (creating objects out of thin air). It is possible to change inanimate objects into animate ones and vice versa – Minerva McGonagall, the class's teacher, transfigures her desk into a pig and back in Philosopher's Stone. Defence Against the Dark Arts Defence Against the Dark Arts, commonly shortened to D.A.D.A., is the class that teaches students defensive techniques to defend against the Dark Arts, and to be protected from Dark creatures. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, with Death Eaters in charge of the school, the subject is renamed the Dark Arts, and involves pupils practicing the Cruciatus Curse on those who have earned detentions. The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members—throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has retained the post for more than one school year. Harry is exceptionally skilled in this subject. During the period the story takes place, the class is taught by Quirinus Quirrell (book one), Gilderoy Lockhart (book two), Remus Lupin (book three), Bartemius Crouch Jr impersonating Alastor \\"Mad-eye\\" Moody (book four), Dolores Umbridge (book five), Severus Snape (book six), and Amycus Carrow (book seven). Hagrid suggests in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets that \\"They're startin' ter think the job's jinxed. No one's lasted long for a while now.\\" In Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledore suggests that Voldemort cursed the position because his application for it was rejected. The existence of the jinx was eventually confirmed by Rowling. The position had also been coveted by Snape, but he was denied the position as well. Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in Half-Blood Prince. Rowling announced in an interview that once Voldemort had died, the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a permanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of Deathly Hallows and the epilogue, set nineteen years afterwards. Furthermore, she imagines that Harry Potter occasionally comes to the class to give lectures on the subject. Charms Charms is the class that teaches how to develop incantations for the uses of bewitchment. Rowling has described Charms as a type of magic spell concerned with giving an object new and unexpected properties. Charms classes are described as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons are largely practical. Many of the exposition sequences in the books are set in Charms classes, which are on the second floor of Hogwarts. The class is taught by Filius Flitwick. Potions Potions is described as the art of creating mixtures with magical effects. It requires the correct mixing and stirring of ingredients at the right times and temperatures. As to the question of whether a Muggle could brew a potion, given the correct magical ingredients, Rowling has said, \\"Potions seems, on the face of it, to be the most Muggle-friendly subject. But there does come a point in which you need to do more than stir.\\"2006: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K. Rowling interviews on the web, quick-quote.quill.org Rowling later confirmed on Pottermore that \\"There is always some element of wandwork necessary to make a potion.\\" Snape's lessons are depicted as unhappy, oppressing times set in a gloomy dungeon in the basement of the castle, whilst Slughorn's, who replaces Snape as Potions Master, are shown as more cheerful and even fun at times. Astronomy Astronomy classes take place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in Hogwarts, and are taught by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involve observations of the night skies with telescopes. No astronomy lessons are shown in the books, but they are frequently referenced. Rowling describes one of Harry's Astronomy exams in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Also, bits of the Astronomy Tower are seen throughout the film series, such as HP2 and HP3, and featured in Half-Blood Prince, as the place where Dumbledore died, and seen in Deathly Hallows. Known student homework activities include learning the names of stars, constellations and planets, and their location, movements, and environments. History of Magic History of Magic is the study of magical history. Cuthbert Binns' lessons are depicted as some of the most boring at Hogwarts. They are only lectures, given without pause, about significant events in wizarding history. Topics have included goblin rebellions, giant wars, and the origins of wizarding secrecy. This is the only class at Hogwarts that is taught by a ghost, as the professor never noticed he had died and simply continued teaching as if nothing had changed. Herbology Herbology is the study of magical plants and how to take care of, utilise and combat them. There are at least three greenhouses described in the books, holding a variety of magical plants. Herbology is also the only subject Neville excels in. The epilogue to Deathly Hallows explains that he later replaces Professor Sprout as the Herbology teacher. Arithmancy Arithmancy is a branch of magic concerned with the magical properties of numbers. As Harry Potter does not take this subject, the class is never described in the books. It is, however, a favourite subject of Hermione. Arithmancy is reportedly difficult, as it requires memorising or working with many charts. In Order of the Phoenix, it is mentioned that the study of Arithmancy is required to become a Curse-Breaker for Gringotts. The subject is taught by Professor Septima Vector. Study of Ancient Runes Study of Ancient Runes, more commonly known as Ancient Runes, is a generally theoretical subject that studies the ancient runic scripts. Because only Hermione studies it, little else is known about this subject, taught by Professor Bathsheda Babbling. In Deathly Hallows Dumbledore bequeaths his copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which is written in ancient runes, to Hermione. Divination Divination is the art of predicting the future. Various methods are described, including tea leaves, fire omens, crystal balls, palmistry, cartomancy (including the reading of conventional playing cards and the tarot), astrology, and dream interpretations. Divination is described by Professor McGonagall as \\"one of the most imprecise branches of magic\\". Supporters of the subject claim that it is an inexact science that requires innate gifts such as the \\"Inner Eye\\". Those opposed claim that the subject is irrelevant and fraudulent. Harry is first taught Divination by Professor Trelawney, and then later by Firenze after Trelawney is sacked by Dolores Umbridge in Harry's fifth year. In the sixth (and presumably seventh) year, Firenze and Professor Trelawney share Divination classes, divided by year. Care of Magical Creatures Care of Magical Creatures is the class which instructs students on how to care for magical beasts. Classes are held outside the castle. In Harry's first two years, the class is taken by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn who then retires \\"in order to enjoy more time with his remaining limbs\\". Dumbledore then recruits the gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid to accept a teaching position along with his gamekeeping duties. Although Hagrid is obviously very experienced and knowledgeable, he doesn't \\"have a normal person's view of what's dangerous\\", an example being that the Care of Magical Creatures students were required to get a literally ferocious textbook called the \\"Monster Book of Monsters\\", and so consistently misjudges the risk that the animals he uses in his lessons pose to his students, which sometimes results in chaos. When Hagrid is absent, his lessons are taken over by Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank, a witch and an acquaintance of Dumbledore's. Muggle Studies Muggle Studies is a class that involves the study of the Muggle (non-magical) culture \\"from a wizarding point of view.\\" The only need for witches and wizards to learn about Muggle ways and means is to ensure they can blend in with Muggles while needing to do so (for example, at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup). As the class is only mentioned as being taken by Hermione, and for just one year, little is known about its curriculum. In the opening chapter of the final book, Voldemort murders Professor Charity Burbage because she portrays Muggles in a positive light and is opposed to limiting wizardry to only people of pure-blood origins. For the rest of the academic year covered by Deathly Hallows, the Death Eater Alecto Carrow teaches Muggle Studies. However, her lessons (which are made compulsory) mainly describe Muggles and Muggle-borns as subhuman and worthy of persecution. Alchemy Alchemy classes are not mentioned in the Harry Potter series; however, Rowling has used Alchemy as an example of a 'specialized' subject offered when there is sufficient demand. Alchemy is a philosophical tradition searching for the philosopher's stone, which is said to have the power to turn base metals into gold and to contain the elixir of life, which makes or keeps the drinker young and immortal. As mentioned in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Nicholas Flamel created a Philosopher's Stone, but it was destroyed at the end of Harry's first year. Flying Flying is the class that teaches the use of broomsticks made for the use of flying and is taught only to Hogwarts first years by Rolanda Hooch. The subject is the only one that requires physicality. The only flying lesson depicted in the Harry Potter series is in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone; the class is never mentioned in following installments; and is not a part of the O.W.L. exams during Harry's fifth year. Apparition Apparition is an optional class for those in the sixth and seventh years at Hogwarts, in preparation for obtaining their license. In Harry's sixth year, Wilkie Twycross, a Ministry of Magic Apparition instructor, teaches the lessons. Magical enchantments on Hogwarts castle and grounds prevent Apparition and Disapparition inside the castle; however Half- Blood Prince explains that these protections are temporarily relaxed within the Great Hall for short periods to permit students to practice. Students are warned, though, that they will not be able to Apparate outside of the Great Hall and that it would be unwise to try. Splinching is a common mistake in apparition which causes body parts to split. It is impossible to track anyone by apparition unless the person grabs the apparator’s clothing or body. Spell-like effects Unbreakable Vow The Unbreakable Vow is a voluntary agreement made between two witches or wizards. It must be performed with a witness (\\"Bonder\\") on hand, holding their wand on the agreeing persons' linked hands to bind them with magic as a tongue of flame. The Vow is not literally \\"unbreakable\\" as the person taking it is still able to go back on his or her word, but doing so will cause instant death. The Unbreakable Vow was first introduced in Half-Blood Prince, in which Snape made a promise to Narcissa Malfoy to protect Draco, with Bellatrix as the \\"Bonder\\", as her son attempted to fulfil the Dark Lord's task, and for Snape to fulfil the task if Draco fails. Another example in Half-Blood Prince occurs when Ron tells Harry how Fred and George tried to make him undertake an Unbreakable Vow, but because of their father's intervention, they did not succeed. Priori Incantatem Priori Incantatem (from Latin: priorem incantatum - a previous spell), or the Reverse Spell Effect, is used to detect the spells cast by a wand. The spells cast by the wand will emerge in smoky or ghost-like replicas in reverse order, with the latest spell emerging first. It is first encountered in Goblet of Fire when the house elf Winky is found holding Harry's wand. This spell is used to reveal that it was indeed Harry's wand that cast the Dark Mark. In Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, it is revealed that the teenage Voldemort murdered his father and grandparents using his uncle Morfin's wand, knowing that, when examined, the wand would incriminate Morfin as the murderer. In Deathly Hallows, Harry fears that a Priori Incantatem spell will be used on Hermione's wand after the Death Eaters get hold of it. This would reveal that she had accidentally broken his holly- and-phoenix-feather wand when a curse misfired and they both narrowly escaped Voldemort earlier. As a result, the protection of the shared cores was lost and, worse still, this would now be made known to Voldemort. During the final duel between Harry and Voldemort, the latter mentions that he knows that the holly and phoenix wand is destroyed, implying that the Priori Incantatem has indeed been performed on Hermione's wand, as they had feared. Forcing two wands that share the source of their cores to do battle can also cause a more potent form of Priori Incantatem. The tips of the two wands will connect, forming a thick golden \\"thread\\" of energy, and the two wands' masters fight a battle of wills. The loser's wand will regurgitate shadows of spells that it has cast in reverse order. This phenomenon occurs during the duel between Harry and Voldemort at the end of Goblet of Fire. Their simultaneous spells (Harry and Voldemort cast \\"Expelliarmus\\" and \\"Avada Kedavra\\" respectively) trigger the threads, and as Voldemort loses the battle of wills, his wand regurgitates, in reverse order, echoes of the people his wand had last murdered: Cedric Diggory; Frank Bryce; Bertha Jorkins; as well as Harry's parents. Harry was previously informed by Mr. Ollivander that the holly wand that \\"chose\\" Harry was the \\"brother\\" of the yew wand that gave him the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead, although the significance of this was not discussed then. Dumbledore later reveals to Harry that his and Voldemort's wands both contain a tail feather given by Dumbledore's pet phoenix, Fawkes. Dark Arts The Dark Arts are magical spells and practices that are usually used for malicious purposes. Practitioners of Dark Arts are referred to as Dark witches or wizards. The most prominent of these is Voldemort, known to them as the Dark Lord. His followers, known as Death Eaters, practice the Dark Arts while doing his bidding. The type of spells characteristic of Dark Arts are known as curses,J.K. Rowling's Official Site which usually cause harm to the target. All, to a certain degree, are in some circumstances justifiable. The motivation of the caster affects a curse's result. This is most notable in the case of Cruciatus: when cast by Harry, angered by the death of his godfather at Bellatrix's hands AND desiring to punish her, it causes a short moment of pain. As Bellatrix herself comments, righteous anger does not allow the spell to work for long. When cast by figures such as Voldemort, who desire to inflict pain for its own sake, it causes intense agony that can last as long as the Dark witch or wizard desires. Use of Dark Magic can corrupt the soul and body; Voldemort has used such magic in his quest to prolong his life and obtain great power. The Dark Arts also cause Voldemort to look deformed and inhuman, a side effect of splitting his soul into Horcruxes. According to Snape, the Dark Arts \\"are many, varied, ever-changing and eternal... unfixed, mutating, indestructible\\"., chapter 9 In magical dueling, there are any number of spells that may be used to attack, immobilise, or disarm an opponent without causing pain or lasting harm; however, spells such as the Cruciatus Curse or Sectumsempra, judged to be Dark by reliable authorities, wound or seriously distress a victim in some way. Dark spells can be classified into three groups: jinxes, hexes & curses. In the wizarding world, use of the Dark Arts is strongly stigmatised and some aspects are illegal; however, these spells are prevalent enough that even before the rise of Voldemort, many schools (including Hogwarts) taught Defence Against the Dark Arts as a standard subject. Techniques include anti-curses and simple spells to disable or disarm attackers or fight off certain creatures. Some schools, such as Durmstrang, teach Dark Magic. A Dark Arts class is also taught at Hogwarts while it is under Death Eater control. Unforgivable Curses The Unforgivable Curses are the most powerful known Dark Arts spells. They were first classified as unforgivable in 1717. Used by the books' villains, such as Voldemort and the Death Eaters and in some cases the Ministry of Magic, their use inspires horror and great fear amongst others. The curses are so named because their use is forbidden and unforgivable in the wizarding world and is punishable by a life sentence in Azkaban. The only exception is if a person is proved to have done them under the influence of mind control. These curses are thus very rarely used openly. *The Killing Curse (incantation: Avada Kedavra) manifests as a jet of green light that causes immediate, painless death. The Killing Curse has no counter-curse and cannot be blocked by most magical means, although it can be blocked by love. However, the green energy bolt may be dodged, blocked with solid objects or intercepted with a few other powerful fast spells, particularly Stunning spells. Harry Potter is the only person known to have survived (twice), nullified (once) and deflected (once) this curse. *The Cruciatus Curse (incantation: Crucio, Latin for \\"I torture\\") causes the victim intense pain and is used for torture, but does not physically harm them. The strength of the curse is determined by the person who cast it. It was used regularly by the Death Eaters. The curse can torture a person to the point that they are exhausted to death, or in a more sadistic case, it causes permanent amnesia and insanity. Effective casting requires the caster to have sadistic desires. It is shown as a bright-faded blue light (though it is usually invisible or even a red bolt of light in the films). *The Imperius Curse (incantation: Imperio, faux Latin for \\"I command\\", cf. imperialism and imperative) is used for mind control or hypnosis and can force the victim to do things they would normally be unwilling or unable to. The strength and duration of the curse depends on the caster, as well as the level of resistance of the victim. The curse is shown as a bright haze (while it was either invisible or green, mist-like haze in the films). The use of the Unforgivable Curses was authorised against Voldemort and his followers by Bartemius Crouch Sr, during the First Wizarding War. (Shortly after his resurrection, Voldemort names two Death Eaters \\"killed by Aurors\\".) In addition, in Deathly Hallows, the Unforgivable Curses are used liberally by good characters, ranging from Professor McGonagall with the Imperius Curse, to Harry effectively using the Cruciatus Curse. He also uses the Imperius Curse on a goblin and a suspicious Death Eater during their disguised attack upon Gringotts Bank.  Dark Mark  The Dark Mark is the symbol of Voldemort and the Death Eaters and takes the form of a skull with a snake coming out of the mouth in place of a tongue. The mark is cast into the sky by Death Eaters whenever they have murdered someone. Morsmordre is the spell to conjure the Mark. It first appears in Goblet of Fire and is described as a \\"colossal skull, composed of what looked like emerald stars, with a serpent protruding from its mouth like a tongue\\". Once in the sky it was \\"blazing in a haze of greenish smoke\\". Dark Marks are also branded on the left forearm of the closest followers of Voldemort. The mark serves as a connection between Voldemort and each who bears it; he can summon them by touching his mark, causing it and those of his followers to burn and change colour. Death Eaters can summon Voldemort in the same fashion. Following Voldemort's ultimate defeat, the Dark Marks on his Death Eaters fade into a scar \\"similar\\" to Harry's. In the books, the Dark Mark is described as green; however, in the films, it was only green at the Quidditch World Cup. In all other film appearances it has been grey. Inferius An Inferius (plural: Inferi) is a corpse controlled through a Dark wizard's spells. An Inferius is not alive, but a dead body that has been bewitched into acting like a puppet for the witch or wizard; this manifests itself as a white mist in the controlled corpse's eyes. They cannot think for themselves: they are created to perform a specific duty assigned by the Dark wizard who commands them, and as seen in the Inferi guarding Voldemort's Horcrux in a seaside cave, remain idle until their task can be performed. This task is then thoughtlessly carried out, whether or not it will produce any result. Inferi are difficult to harm by magic; however, they can be repelled by fire or any other forms of heat or light, as the Inferi in Voldemort's cave had never been exposed to either of these elements. When defeated, they return to their idle state. Inferi are considered dangerous and frightening enough by the magical world that impersonating an Inferius (as Mundungus Fletcher is reported to have done in Half-Blood Prince) is an offence worthy of imprisonment in Azkaban. The Ministry of Magic fears that Voldemort is killing enough people to make an army of Inferi: as they are dead, they are very difficult to stop. When Voldemort was hiding one of his Horcruxes in the past, he filled a lake in a cave with many Inferi, which were to attack and drown anyone but Voldemort who came into the cavern and took the locket. When Harry and Dumbledore took the locket, the Inferi attacked Harry; Dumbledore repelled them with a rope of fire. It is also revealed that the Inferi almost killed Kreacher after he drank from the basin to help Voldemort hide his Horcruxes, but having been ordered to return to his master after his task with Voldemort was complete, he was able to apparate out of the cave. These Inferi later killed Regulus Black when he stole the Horcrux and ordered Kreacher to destroy it. In Latin, the word inferus (plural: inferi) means \\"below\\", often referring in the plural to \\"the gods below\\" (see di inferi) or the spirits of the dead. Inferius is a neuter singular form of inferior, a comparative adjective meaning \\"lower\\".Morphology of inferius by The Perseus Project Horcrux A horcrux is an object created using dark magic to attain effective immortality. The concept is first introduced in the sixth novel, Harry Potter and the Half- Blood Prince, although horcruxes are present in earlier novels without being described or expanded upon. To create a horcrux, a witch or wizard must first prepare the chosen object in a ritual which is referred to only as “too horrible to go into detail about”. Following the preparation of the object, the witch or wizard must then take a life, an act which splits the soul. Following that, further dark rituals are required in order to remove the soul shard from the maker and place it into the prepared object. Once this is done, the Horcrux becomes impervious to almost all forms of destruction, requiring extremely powerful magic or substances to do so. Ordinarily, when one's body is killed, the soul departs for the next world. If, however, the body of a horcrux owner is killed, that portion of his soul which had remained in his body will not pass on to the next world, but will rather exist in a non- corporeal form capable of being resurrected by another wizard. If all of someone's horcruxes are destroyed, then his soul's only anchor in the material world would be his body, the destruction of which would then cause his final death. To destroy the horcrux, the destroyer must destroy it in such a way that it is put beyond magical repair. In the seventh book, Gryffindor’s sword, Basilisk fang and Fiendfyre are the substances used to destroy them. Portraits In the Harry Potter series the subjects of magical portraits (even those of characters that are dead) can move, interact with living observers, speak and demonstrate apparent emotion and personality. Some can even move to other portraits to visit each other, or relay messages, or (if more than one painting of the subject exists) move between separate locations by way of their portraits. An example of this is Phineas Nigellus Black, who has a painting in the Headmaster's office and at Number 12 Grimmauld Place. Many such portraits are found on the walls of Hogwarts. Some portraits are used to conceal the entrance of a room or passageway. For example, the Fat Lady's portrait covers the entrance to the Gryffindor common room, and she can swing the portrait open when given the correct password or close to prevent entry. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, there is a portrait of Ariana Dumbledore in the Room of Requirement that conceals a secret passageway to the Hog's Head. There is also a painting of a large fruit bowl in front of the Hogwarts kitchen, which will swing open if the pear is tickled to reveal a hidden door. Portraits are enchanted to move by the artist, but the degree to which they can interact with others depends on the power of the subject. Rowling has commented that a portrait is merely a faint imprint of the deceased subject, imitating their basic personality and thought patterns. They are therefore \\"not as fully realised as ghosts\\". In Harry Potter and the Cursed Child the portrait of Albus Dumbledore describes himself as only \\"paint and memory\\" and Professor McGonagall (his successor as headteacher of Hogwarts) comments that, although she speaks to Dumbledore to help her in making decisions, she is careful to remember that \\"portraits don't represent even half of their subjects\\". Portraits in the Headmaster's office The portraits in the Headmaster's office depict all the former Heads of Hogwarts, with the exception of Dolores Umbridge. They advise the Headmaster and are \\"honour-bound to give service to the present headmaster\\" (according to Armando Dippet). Rowling has explained that portraits of past headteachers tend to be more realistic than most, as the subject in question usually imparts knowledge and teaches them how to behave before their death. The portrait of Snape was installed in the Headmaster's Office at Harry's request. The Fat Lady The portrait of the Fat Lady covers the door to Gryffindor Tower. She will open it (sometimes grudgingly) when the correct password is uttered. She is often upset after being awoken, and is sometimes seen drunk with her best friend, Violet. The Fat Lady has no other known name – even the unfailingly polite Albus Dumbledore refers to her only as \\"the Fat Lady\\" – and it may be that she does not represent a real person but is instead an invention of her portrait's artist. In Philosopher's Stone, she leaves her portrait in the middle of the night, locking Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Neville out of Gryffindor Tower, forcing them to run across the school. Luckily for them, when they return, she has returned to her portrait, allowing them to escape into Gryffindor Tower. In Prisoner of Azkaban, Sirius Black slashes the Fat Lady's portrait when she won't let him in without a password and it is some time before she dares to guard Gryffindor Tower again. After her portrait is restored, she requests protection in case someone tries to attack her portrait again. Thus, two security trolls are hired. In Half-Blood Prince, she gets so annoyed with Harry's late return that she pretends the password has changed and tries to call him back when he heads off to talk to Dumbledore. When Harry later confirms Dumbledore's death, she lets out a sob and, for the only time in the series, she opens without the password for Harry in her grief. In the first film the Fat Lady is played by Elizabeth Spriggs, and by Dawn French in the third film. Photographs Wizarding photographs of people have similar properties to magical painted portraits: the figures within move about or even sometimes leave the frame. They appear in wizard newspapers and other print media, as well as on Chocolate Frog cards. Colin Creevey mentions in Chamber of Secrets that a boy in his dormitory said that if he develops the film from his Muggle camera 'in the right potion', the pictures will move., chapter 6 However, unlike portraits, figures in wizarding pictures cannot speak and display little sentience. It appears that they do have some knowledge of current events, as in Order of the Phoenix, the family photograph on Arthur's desk shows everyone except Percy \\"who appeared to have walked out of it\\"., chapter 7 References Further reading * * * External links Category:Harry Potter universe Harry Potter fr:Univers de Harry Potter#Magie ","title":"Magic in Harry Potter"},{"id":"310359","text":"Moe, MOE, MoE or m.o.e may refer to: In arts and entertainment Characters * Moe Szyslak, from the animated television show The Simpsons * Moe, leader of The Three Stooges, played by Moe Howard Other * , a Japanese slang term applied to characters in video games or anime and manga * Moe (band), often stylized as \\"moe.\\", an American jam band formed in 1989 * m.o.e., short for Master of Entertainment, a Pony Canyon label for some of their anime works People * Moe (given name), including nicknames * Moe (surname) Places United States * Moe Lake, a lake in Minnesota * Moe Pond, a lake in New York * Moe Township, Douglas County, Minnesota * Moe Settlement, Wisconsin, a ghost town * Mobile (Amtrak station), Amtrak station code MOE, Alabama Elsewhere * Moe, Estonia, a village * Moe, Victoria, Australia * Moe River, Victoria, Australia * Moe Island, South Orkney Islands, Antarctica Science and technology * .moe, an internet top-level domain * Molecular Operating Environment, a software system sold by Chemical Computing Group Other uses * Battleships Asbjørnsen and Moe, rumored, but non- existent Norwegian ships that concerned Swedish intelligence services in 1905 * Magpul Original Equipment, a designation used by the manufacturer of firearms equipment * Ministry of Education * Margin of exposure See also * Mo (disambiguation) * Moe's (disambiguation) * Noe (disambiguation) ","title":"Moe"},{"id":"310361","text":"The Patuxent Wildlife Research Center. The Patuxent River is a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay in the state of Maryland. There are three main river drainages for central Maryland: the Potomac River to the west passing through Washington, D.C., the Patapsco River to the northeast passing through Baltimore, and the Patuxent River between the two. The Patuxent watershed had a rapidly growing population of 590,769 in 2000. It is the largest and longest river entirely within Maryland, and its watershed is the largest completely within the state. Geography The river source, from the Chesapeake, is in the hills of the Maryland Piedmont near the intersection of four counties – Howard, Frederick, Montgomery and Carroll, and only from Parr's Spring, the source of the south fork of the Patapsco River. Flowing in a generally southeastward direction, the Patuxent crosses the urbanized corridor between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., and opens up into a navigable tidal estuary near the colonial seaport of Queen Anne in Prince George's County, Maryland, just southeast of Bowie, finding the Chesapeake Bay later. The fifty-two mile- long tidal estuary is never wider than . It marks the boundary between Montgomery, Prince George's, Charles and St. Mary's counties on the west and Howard, Anne Arundel, and Calvert counties on the east. The Chesapeake estuary's deepest point, below sea level, is in the lower Patuxent. The two largest cities in the watershed are Bowie and Laurel, Maryland. There is a percentage of agricultural activity in the region as well. The mid and lower banks of the river have swamp and marshland ecosystems. Many of those ecosystems are protected by some form of parkland, on the state and local levels. The most notable of which include Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary, Merkle Wetlands Sanctuary, and Patuxent River Park, along with many more. Farther north, there is the 20 square mile Patuxent Research Refuge, which helps to protect Patuxent River wildlife. Tributaries The Little Patuxent River, the Middle Patuxent River, and the Western Branch are the three largest tributaries. The Middle Patuxent flows into the Little Patuxent just upstream from the historic Savage Mill in Savage. The Little Patuxent then joins the Patuxent just southwest of Crofton. The Middle Patuxent flows through the middle of Howard County, while the Little Patuxent flows through northeast and southeast Howard County and western Anne Arundel County.U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011 Western Branch originates under the name Folly Branch in the Wingate Drive area of the northern part of Glenn Dale, assuming the name \\"Western Branch\\" in Woodmore, continuing southward through Prince George's County, joined by Collington Branch before it joins the Patuxent near Upper Marlboro. History Native Americans have lived along the Patuxent River since at least 1100 BC. An archaeological dig at Pig Point (just north of Jug Bay at the end of Wrighton Road Pig Point Archaeology Site, at the end of Wrighton Road, Bristol, via Google Maps) uncovered some of the oldest known artifacts in the Mid Atlantic states,\\"Amazing artifacts unearthed at Pig Point\\", E.B. Furgurson III, The Archaeology News Network, April 2011. Original source: The Capital [April 17, 2011] including pottery, arrow and spear points and remnants of wigwams, fires and foodways. The site was probably a center of trade in the region and has one of the best unbroken archaeological records on the East Coast. The Pig Point site includes remnants of the oldest structures ever found in Maryland, wigwam post holes dating to the 3rd century. The Patuxent River was first named (\\"Pawtuxunt\\") on the detailed map resulting from the 1608 voyage upriver by Jamestown, Virginia settler John Smith. Captain Smith got as far as the rough vicinity of the present-day Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary (Lyons Creek) area, from the Chesapeake near what is now the Anne Arundel–Calvert–Prince George's County tripoint. This was most likely the second visit by Europeans to the Patuxent, as in June 1588 a small Spanish expedition under Vicente Gonzalez is believed to have anchored for the night in the Patuxent mouth. The river was an important colonial shipping port with the government's garrison situated at the mouth of the river where Charles Calvert was first Collector in 1673.Maryland Archaeological Conservation Laboratory. \\"Mattapany (18ST390)\\".

By the mid and late 17th century respectively, colonists spread upriver to Mt. Calvert and Billingsley Point, two 18th-century mansions upriver from the Chesapeake that are today part of Patuxent River Park. By the 1730s, the Snowden iron ore furnace (also known as Patuxent Furnace) just southeast of Laurel, was shipping \\"pig iron\\" downriver from the current vicinity of the 1783 Montpelier Mansion, also part of Patuxent River Park. In August 1814, Commodore Joshua Barney and his Chesapeake Bay Flotilla were trapped in the Patuxent by the British fleet under Admiral Sir George Cockburn. To keep them from British hands, Barney's men ignited the magazines of his ships in the four mile (6 km) stretch above Pig Point ( upriver from the Chesapeake when the British approached. The British then launched their attack on Washington, D.C., from their warships in the Patuxent at Benedict, away. From there, the troops marched through, Nottingham, Upper Marlboro, Bladensburg and on to Washington. Economy and commerce Tobacco farming dominated the Patuxent's economy for the two centuries following white settlement, with about sixty percent of Maryland's tobacco coming from the Patuxent valley by the late 18th century. Destruction of the plantations by the British and of the soil by centuries of tobacco farming brought the mid and lower Patuxent valley into a period of decline that would last until the 1930s, when there were fewer residents in the Patuxent's Calvert County than there were in the 1840s, and only a few hundred more than in the first Calvert County census in 1790. The Patuxent was plied by regular steamship service, mostly from the Weems Line, from the 1820s to the 1920s, replacing the schooners and sailing packets that had for the previous centuries served the river's many landings and docks along the tidal reach. The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission constructed two dams on the main branch in the mid-20th century. Brighton Dam was constructed from the Chesapeake in 1943, impounding the waters of Triadelphia Reservoir; in 1952 the T. Howard Duckett Dam was constructed further downstream, near Laurel, thus creating Rocky Gorge Reservoir.Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. Laurel, MD (2007). \\"The WSSC-- A Thumbnail History.\\" Accessed 2010-02-15. The land surrounding the two reservoirs is administered by the WSSC, creating a forested reserve of accessible to the public for horseback riding, hunting, fishing, and picnicking in limited areas.

With public recreational land on one or both shores of 74 of the river's 115 miles including the reservoir land, the impact that recreation in natural settings now has on the river's economy is obvious. The Patuxent Naval Air Station at the mouth of the river has continued to grow over past decades, providing along with tourism another main economic engine in the lower river valley which includes the popular boating center of Solomons. Environmental concerns According to EcoHealth Report Cards, the Patuxent River has a below average health rating, scoring a 38%, compared to the Chesapeake's over all health rating of 54, as of 2016. However, the river does have higher ratings in dissolved oxygen, and likely, will soon have higher ratings in phosphorus. The Middle and Little Patuxent watersheds include nearly all of Columbia, Maryland, including its downtown urban Lake Kittamaqundi and Wilde Lake. Columbia is a large planned community in Howard County that opened in 1967. Columbia's major downtown roadway is called Little Patuxent Parkway, and Maryland Route 175 in East Columbia was known as the Patuxent Parkway until May 2006, when it was renamed for Columbia's founder, the late James Rouse, and his wife, Patty. It was the largely unchecked erosion from this late 1960s and 1970s building spree that contributed the bulk of the Patuxent River's highest and most damaging sediment, siltation, and pollution levels to date downstream. This in turn led to a nearly complete destruction of a once thriving seafood industry along the brackish portion of the river. \\"The Patuxent River has known no greater friend, advocate and defender than Bernie Fowler.\\" Quote attributed to Congressman Steny Hoyer. Fowler, as an early-1970s Calvert County Commissioner, led the way in a lawsuit filed by downriver Charles, Calvert and St. Mary's counties against upriver counties. The lawsuit forced the state, the upriver counties, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to enact pollution control measures. Between 1985 and 2005, the Patuxent saw a 26% decrease in nitrogen, a 46% decrease in phosphorus, and a 35% reduction in sediment, despite urban areas increasing to 31% of the watershed by 2002. Of the Chesapeake's major tributaries, the Patuxent is the only one having most of its harmful phosphorus and nitrogen nutrient overloads coming from urban runoff. The river's other two largest contributors, point sources (industrial, sewage, etc.) and the declining (24%) agricultural areas, contribute less of the nutrient load. Forested areas account for 43% of the watershed. In 2004 Fred Tutman became the first \\"Riverkeeper\\" for the Patuxent. The mission of the Patuxent Riverkeeper organization, a member of the worldwide Waterkeeper Alliance, is to protect and improve the quality of the river's water and watershed and provide access and education at its facility in Nottingham. Over the past 50 years, nationally recognized land preservation efforts in this part of Maryland have saved tens of thousands of acres from the Baltimore- Washington bedroom community sprawl. The southern half of the U.S. Army's Fort Meade was added to the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, which, at , is the second largest contiguous public park-refuge within of either Washington or Baltimore. It is located midway between these two cities. The contiguous public area of centered on Jug Bay, upriver from the Chesapeake, form the fifth largest such Baltimore-DC preserve and largest tidewater one and consist of the Jug Bay Wetlands Sanctuary, the Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary, and the Jug Bay component of the Patuxent River Park. The Patuxent River State Park in the uppermost part of the basin is the seventh largest. Bridges { class= ! Crossing ! Carries ! Location !

The profile was designed in 1922 by Virginius E. Clark. The airfoil has a thickness of 11.7 percent and is flat on the lower surface aft of 30 percent of chord. The flat bottom simplifies angle measurements on propellers, and makes for easy construction of wings. For many applications the Clark Y has been an adequate airfoil section; it gives reasonable overall performance in respect of its lift-to-drag ratio, and has gentle and relatively benign stall characteristics. But the flat lower surface is not optimal from an aerodynamic perspective, and it is rarely used in modern designs. Yak-18T The Clark YH airfoil is similar but with a reflexed (turned up) trailing edge producing a more positive pitching moment reducing the horizontal tail load required to trim an aircraft.The Incomplete Guide to Airfoil Usage .

The Clark Y was chosen as its flat bottom worked well with the design goal of a low radar cross-section. Model aircraft The Clark Y has found favor for the construction of model aircraft, thanks to the flight performance that the section offers at medium Reynolds number airflows. Applications on model aircraft is very wide, ranging from free-flight gliders through to multi-engined radio control scale models. The Clark Y is appealing for its near-flat lower surface, which aids in the construction of wings on plans mounted on a flat construction board.

He was credited with turning around NBC's low prime time reputation with such hit series as Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law, Law & Order, ALF, Family Ties, The Cosby Show, Cheers, Seinfeld, The Golden Girls, Wings, Miami Vice, Knight Rider, The A-Team, Saved by the Bell, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air , St. Elsewhere, and Night Court. Tartikoff also helped develop the 1984 sitcom Punky Brewster; he named the title character after a girl he had a crush on in school. He was also involved in the creation of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Beggars and Choosers. Biography Early life and career Born to a Jewish familyNorwood, Stephen Harlan and Eunice G. Pollack Encyclopedia of American Jewish History. 2008 in Freeport, New York, Tartikoff was a graduate of the Lawrenceville School and Yale University, where he contributed to campus humor magazine The Yale Record. While attending Yale, Tartikoff worked as an account executive and sales manager for WNHC-TV in New Haven, Connecticut, as well as in Hartford, Connecticut. Tartikoff spent vacations in Los Angeles looking for a job in network television. After graduating from Yale, he took a series of jobs in advertising and local television, including WLS-TV in Chicago, Illinois. Career at NBC Tartikoff was hired as a program executive at ABC in 1976. One year later, he moved to NBC (after being hired by Dick Ebersol to direct comedy programming). Tartikoff took over programming duties at NBC from Fred Silverman in 1981. At age 32, Tartikoff became the youngest president of NBC's entertainment division. When Tartikoff took over, NBC was in last place behind ABC and CBS, and the very future of the network was in doubt. A writers' strike was looming, affiliates were defecting, mostly to ABC, and the network had only three prime time shows in the Top 20: Little House on the Prairie, Diff'rent Strokes and Real People. Johnny Carson was reportedly in talks to move his landmark late-night talk show to ABC. The entire cast and writers of Saturday Night Live had left that late-night sketch-comedy series, and their replacements had received some of the show's worst critical notices. By 1982, Tartikoff and his new superior, the highly regarded former producer Grant Tinker, slowly but surely turned the network's fortunes around. As head of NBC's Entertainment Division, Tartikoff's successes included The Cosby Show, for which he had pursued Bill Cosby to create a pilot after having been impressed by Cosby's stories when Cosby guest-hosted The Tonight Show. Tartikoff wrote a brainstorming memo that simply read \\"MTV cops\\", and later presented the memo to series creator Anthony Yerkovich, formerly a writer and producer for Hill Street Blues. The result was Miami Vice, which became an icon of 1980s pop culture. Knight Rider was inspired by a perceived lack of leading men who could act, with Tartikoff suggesting that a talking car could fill in the gaps in any leading man's acting abilities. During the casting process of Family Ties, Tartikoff was unexcited about Michael J. Fox for the role of Alex P. Keaton. However, the show's producer, Gary David Goldberg, insisted until Tartikoff relented saying, \\"Go ahead if you insist. But I'm telling you, this is not the kind of face you'll ever see on a lunch box.\\" Some years later, after the movie Back to the Future cemented Fox's stardom, Fox goodnaturedly sent Tartikoff a lunch box with Fox's picture on it, with a handwritten note reading: \\"Brandon, They wanted me to put a crow in here, but... Love and Kisses, Michael J.\\" Tartikoff kept the lunch box on display in his office. Jerry Seinfeld credited Tartikoff with saving Seinfeld from cancellation during its first four years of struggling ratings.The Howard Stern Show, June 26, 2014. SiriusXM. Johnny Carson broke the news of his retirement in February 1991 to Tartikoff at the Grille in Beverly Hills. For several days only Tartikoff and NBC chairman Bob Wright knew of the planned retirement. Tartikoff wrote in his memoirs that his biggest professional regret was cancelling the series Buffalo Bill, which he later went on to include in a fantasy \\"dream schedule\\" created for a TV Guide article that detailed his idea of \\"The Greatest Network Ever\\". Appearances on NBC's shows During his time at NBC, he made appearances in several of the network's shows. He was played by David Leisure in an episode of ALF, when ALF suggests a sitcom about a family who hosts a loveable alien, making the tongue-in-cheek remark \\"Not in a million years, pal.\\" He hosted Saturday Night Live in 1983 and appeared as himself in an episode of Saved by the Bell, where he briefly entertains the notion of a \\"show about a high school principal and his kids\\", before scoffing at the idea. During his 1983 appearance on Saturday Night Live, one skit featured Tartikoff in a black leather ensemble, with the words \\"Be There\\" spelled out in rhinestones on the back of his jacket. \\"Be There\\" was NBC's slogan during the 1983–84 season. Tartikoff appeared as himself on episodes of Night Court and Night Stand with Dick Dietrick, and in the background of one of the final episodes of Cheers. Post-NBC career He left NBC in 1991, moving to Paramount Pictures to become its chairman. A year later, Tartikoff left that post to spend more time with his daughter, Calla, who was injured in a car crash near the family's Lake Tahoe home. In 1994, he made his comeback to national TV with Last Call, a short-lived late- night discussion show he produced. That same year he also produced The Steven Banks Show for PBS. Later that year, he began a brief run as chairman of New World Entertainment. Just prior to his death, Tartikoff served as the chairman of the AOL project \\"Entertainment Asylum\\", for which he teamed with Scott Zakarin to build the world's first interactive broadcast studio. He also continued to do on-air appearances on shows such as Dave's World and Arli$$. Family In 1982, Tartikoff married Lilly Samuels, and the couple had two daughters, Calla Lianne and Elizabeth Justine. In 1991, eight-year-old Calla suffered a severe brain injury in a car accident and received intense therapy in order to walk and speak again. Princess Calla on Disney’s “The Gummi Bears” was named for Calla Tartikoff.https://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/25/magazine/tm-lilytartikoff12 Tartikoff's parents were survivors of the collision of two 747s in Tenerife, Canary Islands, in 1977.Newsweek, March 1977. Death Tartikoff died on August 27, 1997, at age 48 from Hodgkin's lymphoma cancer, with which he had had three separate bouts over 25 years. He was interred in Mount Sinai Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. The Deep Space Nine sixth- season premiere, \\"A Time to Stand\\", began with a title card reading \\"In memory of Brandon Tartikoff\\". A similar card appeared at the end of the ninth-season premiere of Seinfeld, \\"The Butter Shave\\". On August 29, 1997, Dateline NBC ran an extended tribute to Tartikoff which featured many famous figures whose careers he had influenced, including Warren Littlefield, Dick Ebersol, Bill Cosby, Michael J. Fox, Ted Danson, and Jerry Seinfeld. References Further reading * Tartikoff, Brandon and Leerhsen, Charles.

Though the meaning of the term varies slightly in different Christian theological traditions, it generally means that a church or denomination limits participation either to members of their own church, members of their own denomination, or members of some specific class (e.g., baptized members of evangelical churches). See also intercommunion. A closed- communion church is one that (perhaps with exceptions in unusual circumstances) excludes non-members from receiving communion. This is the practice of all churches dating from before the Protestant Reformation and also of some Protestant church such as some Lutherans and Baptists. Lutherans in the U.S. (excluding ELCA Lutherans) require catechetical instruction for all people, even members from other Lutheran Churches, before receiving the Eucharist while some Baptist churches require part membership while others even require full membership before participating in the communion service. Churches which practice open communion allow all Christians to partake in the Lord's Supper, with membership in a particular Christian community not required to receive bread and wine, in contrast to pre-Reformation churches, which hold that what is received in their celebrations ceases to be bread and wine. Practice Roman Catholic Church The Roman Catholic Church practices closed communion. However, provided that \\"necessity requires it or true spiritual advantage suggests it\\" and that the danger of error or indifferentism is avoided, canon 844 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law of the Latin Church and the parallel canon 671 allow, in particular exceptional circumstances that are regulated by the diocesan bishop or conference of bishops, members who cannot approach a Catholic minister to receive the Eucharist from ministers of churches that have a valid Eucharist.Code of Canon Law, canon 844 §2 It also permits properly disposed members of the Eastern churches who are not in full communion with the Roman Church (Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and Assyrian Church of the East), and of churches judged to be in the same situation with regard to the sacraments to receive the Eucharist from Catholic ministers, if they seek it of their own accord.Code of Canon Law, canon 844 §3 The Catholic Church distinguishes between Churches whose celebration of the Eucharist, as well as holy orders, it recognizes as valid and those of other Christian communities. In the case that it is impossible to approach a Catholic minister, that it is a case of real need or spiritual benefit, and that the danger of error or indifferentism is avoided, the Catholic Church permits its faithful to receive Communion in Orthodox Churches,Code of Canon Law, canon 844 §2 and Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 671 §2 although Orthodox Churches do not honour this and only permit Orthodox Christians to receive Communion in Orthodox Churches. The Catholic Church does not ordinarily allow a Catholic to receive communion in a Protestant church, since it does not consider Protestant ministers to be priests ordained by bishops in a line of valid succession from the apostles, although Moravians, Anglicans and some Lutherans teach that they ordain their clergy in lines of apostolic succession. It applies this rule also to the Anglican Communion, pursuant to Apostolicae curae, a position that the Church of England disputed in Saepius officio. The Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism warns that \\"due consideration should be given to the discipline of the Eastern Churches for their own faithful and any suggestion of proselytism should be avoided.\\"Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism, 125 Recognizing that \\"that everyone in a marriage that binds denominations,\\" the Catholic Church in Germany has produced a pastoral handout allowing Lutheran and Reformed spouses of Roman Catholics to receive Communion from Roman Catholic ministers in certain cases, 'provided they “affirm the Catholic faith in the Eucharist.”' Thus far, Archbishop Hans-Josef Becker (Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paderborn), Archbishop Stefan Heße (Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hamburg), Archbishop Ludwig Schick (Roman Catholic Diocese of Fulda), and Bishop Franz Jung (Roman Catholic Diocese of Würzburg) have implemented the pastoral document, in addition to Bishops Gerhard Feige of Magdeburg and Franz-Josef Bode of Osnabrück declaring their intention to implement the pastoral document well. Bishop Franz Jung, while celebrating a Jubilee Mass on July 5 at Würzburg Cathedral, called inter-denominational marriages \\"denomination-uniting\\" and thus \\"especially invited\\" couples in which one spouse is Protestant to receive the Eucharist during his sermon. Other Western Christians under the jurisdiction of other episcopal conferences are limited by stricter conditions. Those who do personally share Catholic belief in the Eucharist (as the body and blood of the risen Christ, accompanied by his soul and divinity, under the appearances of bread and wine) are permitted to receive the sacrament when there is danger of death or, in the judgment of the diocesan bishop or of the episcopal conference, some other grave necessity urges it and on condition that \\"the person be unable to have recourse for the sacrament to a minister of his or her own Church or ecclesial Community, ask for the sacrament of his or her own initiative, manifest Catholic faith in the sacrament and be properly disposed\\".Directory for the Application of Principles and Norms on Ecumenism, 131Code of Canon Law, canon 844 §4 and Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 671 §4 Exceptions do occur, however. Notably, Pope John Paul II gave Holy Communion to Brother Roger, a Reformed pastor and founder of the Taizé Community, several times; in addition Cardinal Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) also gave Brother Roger the Eucharist. Moreover, after Brother Roger's death, at the Mass celebrated for him in France, \\"communion wafers were given to the faithful indiscriminately, regardless of denomination\\". Eastern Orthodox Church The Eastern Orthodox Church, comprising 14 to 16 autocephalous Orthodox hierarchical churches, is even more strictly a closed-communion Church. Thus, a member of the Russian Orthodox Church attending the Divine Liturgy in a Greek Orthodox Church will be allowed to receive communion and vice versa but, although Protestants, non-Trinitarian Christians, or Catholics may otherwise fully participate in an Orthodox Divine Liturgy, they will be excluded from communion. In the strictest sense, non-Orthodox may be present at the Divine Liturgy only up to the exclamation \\"The doors! The doors!\\" and ought to leave the church after that. However, this attitude has been relaxed in most Orthodox churches; a non-communicant may stay and participate in the Divine Liturgy but may not partake of the Eucharist.Timothy Ware, \\"The Orthodox Church\\" 1963. Thus, while in certain circumstances the Catholic Church allows its faithful who cannot approach a Catholic minister to receive the Eucharist from an Eastern Orthodox priest, the Eastern Orthodox Church does not admit them to receive the Eucharist from its ministers. At the very end of the Divine Liturgy, all people are invited to come up to receive a little piece of bread, called antidoron, which is blessed but not consecrated, being taken from the same loaf as the bread used in the consecration. Non-Orthodox present at the Liturgy are not only permitted but even encouraged to receive the blessed bread as an expression of Christian fellowship and love. The Eastern Orthodox Church is not in Communion with the Roman Church, nor is it in Communion with any Protestant denominational church. Eastern Orthodox Christians are forbidden from receiving Communion in any church other than Eastern Orthodox. Eastern Orthodox Churches accept to Holy Communion only baptized Eastern Orthodox Christians (such as Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Albanian Orthodox, etc), and then only when they have prepared themselves by prayer, by appropriate fasting, and by confession of sins (although the frequency of confession varies between traditions). In addition, Orthodox bishops and other teachers make clear to their faithful that they can only properly receive communion from a canonically ordained priest or bishop within the context of the traditional Orthodox Divine Liturgy (which includes communion taken to the sick). Lutheranism Holy Eucharist in a parish of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, with communicants kneeling at the chancel rails to receive the body of Christ. Confessional Lutheran churches, including the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, practice closed communion and require catechetical instruction for all people before receiving the Eucharist.WELS Topical Q&A;: Romans 16:17 - What Kind of Warning Is This?, Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod\\"Closed Communion\\" @ www.lcms.org.

Understanding Closed Communion, stating \\"Therefore, our Congregation and our Denomination practices what is called ‘close or closed Communion’, meaning that before you take Communion at our Churches, we ask you to take a Communion Class first to properly learn what Communion is all about.\\", by Archive.org Failing to do so is condemned by these Lutherans as the sin of unionism.Christian Encyclopedia: Unionism. Retrieved 2014-06-21. This teaching comes from 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 which says, \\"Is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ? Because there is one loaf, we, who are many, are one body, for we all share the one loaf\\" and Paul's teaching of fellowship in 1 Corinthians 1:10, \\"I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.\\" These Lutherans also take seriously God's threat in 1 Corinthians 11:27,29 that \\"Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of this cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks judgment on himself.\\" Therefore, the belief is that, inviting those forward who have not been first instructed would be unloving on the church's part, because they would be inviting people forward to sin. This is described as akin to letting someone drink poison without stopping him. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest Lutheran Church in America, however, does not practice closed communion, but rather \\"eucharistic hospitality.\\"Use of the Means of Grace: A Statement on the Practice of Word and Sacrament, ELCA, 1997). In terms of guests receiving the Sacrament, according to this practice, the burden of decision of admittance to the Sacrament is not on the host congregation, but on its guests. The invitation to the Sacrament is extended to \\"all baptized persons,\\" along with \\"a brief written or oral statement in worship which teaches Christ's presence in the sacrament.\\" In terms of members receiving the Sacrament, reception of the Sacrament is always to include \\"continuing catechesis [which] include[s] instruction for Holy Communion,\\" but this is not a prerequisite for first communion, and even infants may be permitted to receive the Sacrament at or after the service of their baptism.At what age do ELCA congregations allow members their first Communion?. Retrieved 2010-01-17. Baptists Some Baptists and all American Baptist Association congregations practice closed communion even more strictly than do the Catholic, Lutheran, and Eastern Orthodox churches. They restrict the partaking of communion (or the Lord's Supper) to members of the local church observing the ordinance. Thus members from other churches, even members of other local churches of the same denomination, are excluded from participation. The Strict Baptists in the United Kingdom derive their name from this practice. In the United States the custom is usually, but not exclusively, associated with Landmark ecclesiology. The closed communion practiced by Primitive Baptists admits participation by Primitive Baptists who do not belong to the local church. Other groups The Orthodox Presbyterian Church, the Reformed Presbyterian Church, the American Presbyterian Church the Reformed Seventh- day Adventist Church, Exclusive Brethren, the Apostolic Christian Church, the Church of the Brethren, Mennonites, Amish, some Anglicans, the Church of God in Christ, the Church of God of Prophecy, and some other churches in the Reformed tradition such as Calvinists also practice closed communion. Jehovah's Witnesses hold that only the 144,000 should receive communion. Other nontrinitarian Christians that practice closed communion include the Church of God (Seventh Day), Christadelphians, and Oneness Pentecostals such as the True Jesus Church. Churches of Christ, though doctrinally holding to a closed communion view, in practice do not prohibit visitors from taking communion, on the view that per 1 Corinthians 11:28 the visitor must \\"examine himself\\" and decide to partake or decline (i.e. it is not for the minister, elders/deacons, or members to decide who may or may not partake); thus, it is more a form of open communion. Latter Day Saints The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints (LDS Church) practices closed communion, but does not take any measures to prevent others from participating. The Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) practices open communion. \\"Close Communion\\" Franz Pieper, June 27, 1852 - June 3, 1931 Among the modern descendants of the Anabaptists, the Amish, Old Order Mennonites and Conservative Mennonites all practice what they term close communion, restricting communion to members of a local congregation only. The term close communion normally means the same thing as closed communion. However, some make a distinction, so the terms can be a source of confusion. The most prominent distinction (which in some circles may be called \\"cracked communion\\") is one where a member of a congregation holding the \\"same faith and practice\\" as the hosting congregation (generally meaning being a member of a congregation in the same or a similar denomination) may participate in the service, but a member of another denomination may or may not. For example, a Southern Baptist congregation practicing close communion: *would allow a member of another Southern Baptist congregation to participate, on the premise that both congregations are of the \\"same faith and practice\\" as they are both in the same denomination, and *would (most likely) also allow a member of an Independent Baptist congregation to participate; though the congregations are of different Baptist groups the differences between them are mainly in the area of church organization and not in doctrinal issues, thus falling under the \\"same faith and practice\\" rule, and also *might or might not allow a member of a Pentecostal church to participate (might on the basis of both having similar views on salvation and the Lord's Supper, but might not due to other significant differences), but *would almost certainly exclude a Lutheran or Catholic, on the basis that Baptists and Lutherans/Catholics are not of the \\"same faith and practice\\" as pertaining to the Lord's Supper. *In practice, churches that do not require people to approach a communion table usually pass the elements among the attendees (similar to the offering plate) or provide them ahead of time in a self-serve manner, and as such do not actively prohibit anyone who wishes to partake from doing so, regardless of personal views. The Reformed Presbyterian Church of Australia allows communion to those who can assent to the first three terms of its church covenants, and discuss this with the elders ahead of time. They don't appear to distinguish the term \\"close communion\\" from \\"closed communion\\", though. The earliest use of close communion comes from a mistranslation of the Lutheran theologian Franz August Otto Pieper's Christian Dogmatics. The term has since spread, although both the first edition and later translations corrected the error to \\"closed communion.\\" Text from Minister to Minister, Sept. 1997 - Gerald Kieschnick, President Texas District Supporting belief Complex reasons underlie the belief. In 1 Corinthians 10, it is written: \\"The chalice of benediction which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord? For we, being many, are one bread, one body: all that partake of one bread.\\" Since all Christians are now no longer of a unity that would allow common celebration of the Eucharist between them all, the bread being a visible sign of union, communion is not taken together between separated Churches and communities. Additionally as described in 1Co 11:29: \\"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.\\" It is deemed better to prevent outsiders from taking communion than to risk them taking communion \\"unworthily\\". Catholics thus see the communion as sinful for those who do not recognise the Real Presence or who are otherwise 'unworthy', i.e. who are not in the 'right place' to accept the Eucharist (free of mortal sin). Christian communities that keep close communion often also have accountability within those members that partake of the communion, so that they do not run afoul of this problem. Such communities will also delay taking communion until the members (the church body) can take communion in Christian unity, as required by 1Co 11:33 \\"Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.\\" Justin Martyr indicated that the second- century Christian Church had three requirements for sharing in the Eucharist: identity of belief, Christian baptism, and moral life. \\"No one may share in the eucharist except those who believe in the truth of our teachings and have been washed in the bath which confers forgiveness of sins and rebirth, and who live according to Christ's commands\\" (First Apology, 66). Corporate responsibility is another argument often used in favour of closed communion. The Heidelberg Catechism, for example, says that those who \\"by confession and life, declare themselves unbelieving and ungodly\\" are not to be admitted to the Lord's Supper, for then \\"the covenant of God would be profaned, and his wrath kindled against the whole congregation.\\" Church leaders are obliged to do all they can to ensure that this does not happen, and hence \\"exclude such persons... till they show amendment of life,\\" (Q & A 82). Fenced table In Protestant theology, a fenced table is a communion table which is open only to accredited members of the Christian community. Fencing the table is thus the opposite of open communion, where the invitation to the sacrament is extended to \\"all who love the Lord\\" and members of any denomination are welcome at their own discretion. The phrase goes back to early Scottish Calvinism, where the communion table literally had a fence around it, with a gate at each end. The members of the congregation were allowed to pass the gate on showing their communion token, a specially minted coin which served as an admission ticket and was given only to those who were in good standing with the local congregation and could pass a test of the catechism. Examples of this kind of church furnishing are still to be seen in a very few highland churches. A communion token from South Leith Parish Church The phrase \\"fencing the table\\" is also used metaphorically for other kinds of group demarcation and restrictive practices. Communion tokens Many Scottish Protestant churches used to give tokens to members passing a religious test prior to the day of communion, then required the token for entry. Some US and other churches also used communion tokens.

Mid-Cayman spreading centre as part of the trough, on the western edge of the Gonâve Microplate. The Cayman Trough (also known as the Cayman Trench, Bartlett Deep and Bartlett Trough) is a complex transform fault zone pull-apart basin which contains a small spreading ridge, the Mid-Cayman Rise, on the floor of the western Caribbean Sea between Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. It is the deepest point in the Caribbean Sea and forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. It extends from the Windward Passage, going south of the Sierra Maestra of Cuba toward Guatemala. The transform continues onshore as the Motagua Fault, which cuts across Guatemala and extends offshore under the Pacific Ocean, where it intersects the Middle America Trench subduction zone. The relatively narrow trough trends east-northeast to west-southwest and has a maximum depth of . Within the trough is a slowly spreading north-south ridge which may be the result of an offset or gap of approximately along the main fault trace. The Cayman spreading ridge shows a long-term opening rate of The eastern section of the trough has been named the Gonâve Microplate. The Gonâve plate extends from the spreading ridge east to the island of Hispaniola. It is bounded on the north by the Oriente and Septentrional fault zones. On the south the Gonâve is bounded by the Walton fault zone, the Jamaica restraining bend and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone. The two bounding strike slip fault zones are left lateral. The motion relative to the North American Plate is to the east and the motion relative to the Caribbean Plate is . The western section of the trough is bounded to its south by the Swan Islands Transform Fault. During the Eocene the trough was the site of a subduction zone which formed the volcanic arc of the Cayman Ridge and the Sierra Maestra volcanic terrain of Cuba to the north, as the northeastward-moving Caribbean Plate was subducted beneath the southwest-moving North American Plate, or as some researchers contend, beneath a plate fragment dubbed the East Cuban Microplate. In 2010 a UK team from the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton (NOCS), equipped with an autonomously controlled robot submarine, began mapping the full extent of the trench and discovered black smokers on the ocean floor at a depth of , the deepest yet found. In January 2012, the researchers announced that water exits the vents at a temperature possibly exceeding , making them among the hottest known undersea vents. They also announced the discovery of new species, including an eyeless shrimp with a light-sensing organ on its back.

Square rig  USS Constitution sailing under (bow to stern) jibs, topsails, and spanker. On a square rigged vessel, a topsail is a square sail rigged above the course sail and below the topgallant sail where carried. A full rigged ship has either single or double (\\"split\\" upper and lower) topsails on all masts, the single or lower topsail being the second sail above the deck and the upper topsail where so rigged being the third. Although described as a \\"square\\" sail, this term refers not to a sail's shape but to it and its yard being rigged square to the keel of the vessel rather than in line with it or \\"fore and aft\\"; the topsail was and is always trapezoidal, the lengths of the upper yards being progressively smaller the higher they are. The bottom edge (foot) of the topsail, like that of other square sails, is slightly concave. Although topsails of a kind were used at least as early as Roman times, they first came into use in Europe some time in the 15th century. Initially small and carried only on main and fore masts, they gradually increased in size and importance until by the middle of the 17th century and were the principal and largest sails of the ship, the first sails to be set and the last to be taken in. It was quite common for a ship to sail with topsails and jibs alone; the position of the topsails well above the sea ensured that they received a steady breeze even if the seas were rough. The larger topsails were difficult and dangerous to handle in strong winds. Sometime in the 1680s, reef-bands were introduced to tie up part of the sail, with topsails eventually getting four of these, and reefing the sails became a regular occupation of sailors. In the mid 19th century, topsails of merchant vessels were split into separate upper and lower topsails that could be managed separately and far more easily by smaller crews. Competing versions of the double topsail were invented by Robert Bennet Forbes and Captain Frederic Howes. Although Forbes strove to defend his rig, the Howe rig dominated. In the Forbes rig, both topsail yards are fixed vertically. In the Howe rig, the upper topsail yard slides on the topmast so it can be lowered in a few seconds to close reef the upper topsail. Howe had the foot of the upper topsail closely attached to the lower topsail yard. In 1865 the British clipper Ariel introduced a gap there. Forbes first tried his rig in the topsail schooner Midas in 1844.The clipper Climax built in 1853 under the supervision of Howes was the first ship with Howe rig.  Gaff rig  La Recouvrance with both a gaff topsail and two square topsails; the partly obscured sail between the topmasts is a topmast staysail Gaff topsails, like gaff rigs in general, may still be seen at Tall Ships gatherings. The gaff rig has been largely superseded by the Bermuda rig, which has no topsails. On a gaff-rigged sailing boat, topsails may take a few different forms: A jib- headed topsail is generally a triangular sail set between the gaff and the top of the mast or topmast. A gaff-rigged vessel might have a gaff topsail above any or all of its gaff sails. A yard topsail is similar, but set on a yard. Early 19th-century topsail yards were set almost horizontally, but gradually increased in angle until they became almost vertical extension of the topmast. A jack-yard topsail (or club topsail) instead has its lower edge (or foot) extended out beyond the end of the gaff with a short yard, called a \\"jack- yard\\". A jack-yard topsail may also have the aforementioned vertical yard, although this makes for a very large topsail. A cornish topsail is a triangular sail having its luff extended well above the masthead by being laced to a yard hoisted by a halyard rove through a sheave fitted diagonally in the mast. The heel of the yard fits immediately about the gaff and is kept in place by a tackline called a timminoggy. A square topsail is a square- rigged sail, carried above the foresail only, on gaff schooners. (A brigantine is a two-masted vessel with a forward course.) Schooners carrying square tops are referred to as \\"topsail schooners\\"; gaff topsails are taken for granted on gaff-rigged vessels and pass without comment in a vessel description. A raffee is a square-rigged topsail which is triangular in shape. Spritsail rig Spritsail rig The use of the topsail in Thames sailing barges is significantly different. It is a fore and aft rig, where the mainsail is controlled by brails. In confined waters, the barge will sail under topsail and mizzen, taking advantage of the clear air above the lee of the buildings. The topsail was attached by hoops to the topmast, so could be rapidly struck, the release of one rope let it fall. The topsail a fore and aft sail. The jib topsail a staysail set between the topmast and the bowsprit. Other uses On rigs having multiple jibs or staysails of which at least one is set high, such as many late 19th and 20th Century racing cutters, the uppermost of these, set flying or on a topmast stay, is often called the jib topsail.  Roman navigation  Topsails (Greek: sipharos; Latin: siparum) in the form of an isosceles triangle set above the square mainsail were used in Roman navigation.Casson, Lionel (1995): \\"Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World\\", Johns Hopkins University Press, , pp. 240–241  References  ;Bibliography * * John Harland & Mark Myers, Seamanship in the Age of Sail; Lees \\"Masting & Rigging\\"; \\"The Young Sea-Officer's Sheet Anchor\\" Category:Sailing rigs and rigging ","title":"Topsail"},{"id":"310399","text":"The Primrose Ring is a 1917 American drama silent film directed by Robert Z.

It is also a dormant volcano. The borders between the provinces of Benguet, Ifugao, and Nueva Vizcaya meet at the mountain's peak. It is the third highest mountain in the Philippines, next to Mount Apo and Mount Dulang-dulang. Mount Pulag is famous for its \\"sea of clouds\\" and the view of the Milky Way Galaxy at dawn, which has attracted many tourists who wish to see the \\"other-worldly\\" scenery. The entire mountain is believed to be the home to the tinmongao spirits and is the sacred resting ground of the souls of the Ibaloi people and other ethnic peoples in the area. History The Ibaloi people of Benguet mummify their dead and house them in caverns in the mountain. The Kabayan mummy burial caves, one of the main attraction of the site, are considered Philippine national cultural treasures under Presidential Decree No. 432. Mt. Pulag was proclaimed a national park through Pres. Proclamation No. 75 on February 20, 1987 covering an area of . It is part of the Cordillera Biogeographic Zone and is a National Integrated Protected Areas Programme (NIPAP) site. The national park is inhabited by different ethnic groups such as the Ibalois, Kalanguya, Kankana-eys, Karao, Ifugaos and the Ilocanos. Geography Fogs at Mt. Pulag Mount Pulag stands at high. The peak of the mountain is located in the Municipality of Kabayan Province of Benguet.  Climate  Mossy forest of Mount Pulag National Park Because of its high elevation, the climate on Mount Pulag is temperate with rains predominating the whole year. Rainfall on the mountain averages yearly with August being the wettest month with an average rainfall of . Snow hasn't fallen on its top in at least the past 100 years; however, there have been mild flurries on the mountain, especially during December, January and February. Frost is more common on the mountain due to the low temperature during those months. During the Winter season, the temperature at the highest point of the mountain is known to dip into sub- freezing temperatures, making it the coldest place in the country. The only recorded incidence of snow was in the late 1800s.  Fauna and flora  A short-footed Luzon Tree Rat or a Dwarf Cloud Rat Mount Pulag has a large diversity of flora and fauna, including many species that endemic to the mountain. Mount Pulag hosts 528 documented plant species. It is the natural habitat of the dwarf bamboo (Yushania niitakayamensis) and the Benguet pine (Pinus kesiya) that dominate the areas of Luzon tropical pine forests found on the mountainsides. The Philippine yew tree, which contains a compound associated with cancer treatment, is found on Mount Pulag. Its bark is used by indigenous Ibaloi and Kalanguya communities to make tea. At lower elevations, Mount Pulag has a mossy forest full of ferns, lichens, and moss. Among its native wildlife are 33 bird species and several threatened mammals such as the Philippine deer, giant bushy-tailed cloud rat (bowet) and the long-haired fruit bat. Mount Pulag is the only place that hosts the four cloud rat species. It is one of the most biodiverse locations in the Philippines, with the newly found (since 1896) 185-grams dwarf cloud rat, Carpomys melanurus, a rare breed (endemic to the Cordillera) and the Koch pitta bird among its endangered denizens. Hiking activity Hikers at Mount Pulag summit As the highest mountain in Luzon, Mount Pulag attracts a lot of mountain climbers. Highlights of the climb include the montane forests and the grassland summit with its \\"sea of clouds\\" phenomenon. There are four major trails up the summit: the Ambangeg, Akiki, and Tawangan trails from Benguet and the Ambaguio trail from Nueva Vizcaya. These trails are managed by the Mount Pulag National Park, under the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Incidents Presidential helicopter crash On April 7, 2009, a Philippine Air Force (PAF) Bell 412 of the 250th Presidential Airlift Wing crashed at above sea level in the Kabayan-Pulag pass between Mount Mangingihi and Mount Pulag in thick low cloud and fog. The aircraft pilots and their passengers, who were presidential appointees, died in the crash. Mount Pulag Forest Fire On January 20, 2018, the Mount Pulag National Park temporarily suspended trekking and hiking activities on Mount Pulag following a forest fire at a section of the mountain. According to an initial investigation, the fire started when a butane gas stove brought by a hiker allegedly exploded. The fire officers in site have declared a fire extinguished later that day. Cases were afterwards filed against the perpetrators of the fire. Park rangers estimate that it will take at least 6 months to 1 year before the area recovers holistically.

Trouble in Tahiti received its first performance on 12 June 1952 at Bernstein's Festival of the Creative Arts on the campus of Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, to an audience of nearly 3,000 people. The NBC Opera Theatre subsequently presented the opera on television in November 1952, a production which marked mezzo-soprano Beverly Wolff's professional debut in the role of Dinah. Wolff later reprised the role in the New York City Opera's first staging of the work in 1958. The original work is about 40 minutes long. Background Bernstein was working on the opera during his honeymoon with Felicia Montealegre. The story is based on the relationship of Bernstein's own parents, Sam and Jennie, but the wife's name was changed to the more singable Dinah, Bernstein's grandmother. The work is dedicated to Marc Blitzstein; Blitzstein and Bernstein were good friends, both alumni of the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia. Bernstein had produced one production of Blitzstein's The Cradle Will Rock. Plot analysis The opera is frequently performed with minimal scenery (although Bernstein gave detailed instructions for drops and props) and very simple costumes. There are only two soloists, a married couple named Sam and Dinah. Their son, Junior, is often referred to but is never seen or heard. Other characters are addressed in certain scenes but also are never seen or heard: Sam's client Mr Partridge (on the telephone); his friend Bill (present and interacting with Sam but intended to be invisible); his secretary Miss Brown (present but intended to be invisible); Dinah's psychoanalyst (\\"invisible\\"); her milliner (\\"imaginary\\"). Trouble in Tahiti is the story of one day in the life of these desperately unhappy, though married people, lonely, longing for love, and unable to communicate. At the end of the opera, Sam and Dinah show a willingness to sacrifice for each other, out of commitment to the marriage, though there's not much pleasure to be had. A copyright is held for an alternate ending by Bernstein, which has not been released. Roles {  + !Role !Voice type !Premiere cast, 12 June 1952Cast taken from Opera America: North American Works Directory (Conductor: Leonard Bernstein) - Sam, a businessman baritone David Atkinson - Dinah, his wife mezzo-soprano Nell Tangeman - 1st trio member soprano Constance Brigham - 2nd trio member tenor Robert Kole - 3rd trio member baritone Claude Heater - } Synopsis Prelude – A smiling jazz trio sings of perfect life in an affluent, unnamed suburban town, with its little white houses and happy, loving families (\\"Mornin' Sun\\"). The town could be anywhere; many names are mentioned. Scene I – Real life in suburbia contrasts greatly with what the Trio has painted. Sam and Dinah are having breakfast, alternating between habitual bickering and lyrical moments of longing for kindness. Dinah is angry with Sam. She accuses him of having an affair with his secretary, which he denies (\\"the subject is closed\\"). She also reminds Sam that their son Junior's play is that afternoon, but Sam insists that his handball tournament at the gym is more important, to which she retorts, \\"to hell with the gym\\". She needs more money to pay for her analyst, who Sam calls an \\"out-and-out fake\\". Dinah says Sam should go too, which suggestion Sam pays no attention to. They agree that this is not the way to live, and they will have a conversation about their relationship problems in the evening. They both ask each other for kindness, ask the other for help \\"to love you again\\" and pray that the wall built up between them can be broken down. They continue to argue until Sam leaves for the office, late for his train. Scene II – Sam, at work, exuding confidence, is dealing with business on the telephone. He turns down the curiously-named Mr. Partridge, presumably for a loan. The chorus calls him a genius, \\"you marvelous man\\". \\"When it comes to the dollar, no one touches marvelous Sam.\\" But then comes a call from \\"Bill\\", who he is glad to lend money to: \\"you'll return it whenever you want to... Is it sufficient?\\" Coincidentally, Bill is also participating in the handball tournament with Sam. The chorus observes that \\"when it comes to the giving, no one touches big-hearted Sam\\". Scene III – In her analyst's office, Dinah recalls a dream (\\"I was standing in a garden\\"). > I was standing in a garden, a garden gone to seed, choked with every kind of > weed. There were twisted trees around me, all black against the sky, black, > and bare, and dead, and dry. My father called, come out of this place, I > wanted to go, but there was no way, no sign, no path to show me the way. > Then another voice was calling, it barely could be heard. I remember every > word: \\"There is a garden, come with me, come with me. A shining garden, come > and see, come and see. There love will teach us harmony and grace, harmony > and grace. Then love will lead us to a quiet place.\\" Meanwhile, at Sam's office, he asks his secretary if he ever made a pass at her. When reminded of an incident, he insists, in a menacing way, that it was an accident and that she should forget that it ever happened. Scene IV – Sam and Dinah accidentally run into each other on the street. Rather than having lunch with each other, they both make up lies about imaginary commitments to lunch with others. They continue to sing on the stage (though not to each other), reflecting on the confusing and painful course their relationship has taken, and yearn for their lost happiness. Interlude – Inside the house, the Trio sings of lovely life in Suburbia, detailing the possessions that contribute to the American dream. Scene V – At the gym, Sam has just won the handball tournament. He sings triumphantly about the nature of men (\\"There's a law\\") — how some try with all their might to rise to the top, but will never win; while others, like him, are born winners and will always succeed. \\"Men are created unequal.\\" Scene VI – In a hat shop, Dinah tells an unidentified person about a South Sea romance movie called \\"Trouble in Tahiti\\", which she has just spent the afternoon watching. (Later, we learn that she has missed Junior's play.) At first she dismisses the movie as Technicolor drivel. But as she recounts the story (What a movie!\\") and its theme song \\"Island Magic\\", backed by the Trio, she gets caught up in the escapist fantasy of love. Suddenly self-conscious, she stops herself, as she has to prepare dinner for Sam. Scene VII – About to enter his home, Sam sings of another law of men — that even the winner must pay \\"through the nose\\" for what he gets. The Trio sings of imaginary evenings of domestic bliss in Suburbia: \\"bringing the loved ones together, safe by the warmth of the firelight\\". After dinner, Dinah is knitting and Sam is reading the paper. Sam decides the time has come for their talk, and Dinah, after asking what he wants to talk about, agrees: \\"anything you say\\". Yet Sam can't talk; he doesn't know where to begin. He blames Dinah for interruptions, but she has not said anything. \\"It's no use\\", he says. In the only spoken dialogue in the opera, Sam asks Dinah about Junior's play; she didn't go either. He suggests they go to the movies, to see a new film about Tahiti; Dinah consents. (\\"Sure, why not? Anything.\\") As they leave, they each long for quiet and communion, wondering if it's possible to rediscover their love for one another. For now, they opt for the \\"bought-and-paid-for magic\\" of the silver screen. The Trio makes its final ironic comment, reprising the movie's \\"Island Magic\\" theme song. Orchestral suite With the permission of the Leonard Bernstein Office Inc. (the musical estate of the composer), Paul Chihara adapted the operatic music into an orchestral suite. In March 2012, the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra performed the New York premier of the adaptation at Carnegie Hall. Choral version With the permission of the Leonard Bernstein Office Inc., The Chinese University of Hong Kong Chorus gave a semi- staged performance of the opera with a chamber choir substituting the Trio as scored. On 17 June 2018, the chorus performed the adaptation with Garth Edwin Sunderland's reduced orchestration in their Leonard Bernstein centennial celebration concert \\"Bernstein in the Theater\\" at Hong Kong City Hall Concert Hall. Continuation Bernstein wrote a continuation, A Quiet Place (1983, libretto by Stephen Wadsworth), which was poorly received. It was rewritten incorporating Trouble in Tahiti in the form of an extended flashback.\\"A Quiet Place: An Opera in Three Acts by Leonard Bernstein\\", http://www.leonardbernstein.com/works_a_quiet_place.htm, retrieved 2014-09-09 The opera, set 30 years later, depicts the aftermath of Dinah's death in a car crash and Sam's struggle to reconcile with his adult children.  On screen  In 1970 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation produced a television version of the opera. It was first broadcast in Sydney on ABC-TV on 19 March 1972. It starred Raymond Duparc as Sam and Marie Tysoe as Dinah. A version with live singers performing on animated sets was broadcast on PBS in the United States in 1973, later available on VHS and DVD. Nancy Williams and Julian Patrick played the couple, with Antonia Butler, Michael Clarke and Mark Brown as the trio. Leonard Bernstein conducted. In 2001, the BBC released a film version directed by Tom Cairns with Stephanie Novacek as Dinah and Karl Daymond as Sam. In 2018, Opera North created a film version, based on the company's stage production, produced by The Space and directed by Matthew Eberhardt, starring Wallis Giunta and Quirijn de Lang.

The form is based on those that were inherited from the United Kingdom and France, used in the colonies to refer to the reigning monarch in Europe. As various Canadian territories changed ownership and then the country gradually gained independence, the style and title of the monarchs changed almost as often as the kings and queens themselves. The mode of address currently employed is a combination of a style that originates in the early 17th century and a title established by Canadian law in 1953. Current style and titles In 1953, a year after the accession to the throne of Queen Elizabeth II, the Canadian parliament passed the Royal Style and Titles Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. R-12), providing for the parliament's consent to the issuance of a royal proclamation changing the monarch's title being then used. The relevant royal proclamation was issued on May 28,Proclamation of May 28, 1953 published in the Canada Gazette, volume 87, number 6, Extra, 29 May 1953, pages 1-2 just days before her coronation. Since 1953, the sovereign's style and titles in Canada are, in English: And in French: The style and titles were composed to distinctly mention Canada so as to highlight the monarch's shared status, being both Queen of Canada and, separately, Queen of the United Kingdom, as well as the six (today 14) other Commonwealth realms; with emphasis showing the distinct title Queen of Canada as embedded in the longer formal title: Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith. When composed in 1953, this format was consistent with the monarch's titles in her other realms. However, after 40 years of Elizabeth's reign, only Canada and Grenada retain this title; all others, aside from the UK itself, removed the reference to the United Kingdom. The monarch is typically addressed by the title Queen of Canada and will allude to herself as Queen of Canada when in or acting abroad on behalf of that country. For example, Elizabeth II said in 1973: \\"...it is as Queen of Canada that I am here, Queen of Canada and of all Canadians, not just of one or two ancestral strains.\\" Since the title was adopted, the federal government has promoted its use as a signifier of Canada's sovereign and independent status; Prime Minister John Diefenbaker said of the title in 1957: \\"The Queen of Canada is a term which we like to use because it utterly represents her role on this occasion.\\" The title is also included in the Oath of Allegiance, which forms a part of the Oath of Citizenship, and can be found as —Latin for Elizabeth II by the Grace of God Queen, Canada—on the obverse of various medals in the Canadian honours system. Although the Queen's Canadian titles include Defender of the Faith/, neither the monarch nor any of the viceroys have an official religious role in Canada. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the term (, in Latin) signifies the sovereign's position as Supreme Governor of the Church of England and a member and defender of the security of the Church of Scotland, there have been no established churches in Canada since before its confederation in 1867. Defender of the Faith thus has a more vague meaning in the Canadian title, alluding only to the monarch's belief in a higher power. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent stated on this matter in his 1953 contribution to the debate on the Royal Style and Titles Act in the House of Commons: \\"The rather more delicate question arose about the retention of the words defender of the faith... In our countries [Canada and the other non-British monarchies of the Commonwealth] there are no established churches, but in our countries there are people who have faith in the direction of human affairs by an all-wise Providence; and we felt that it was a good thing that the civil authorities would proclaim that their organization is such that it is a defence of the continued beliefs in a supreme power that orders the affairs of mere men, and that there could be no reasonable objection from anyone who believed in the Supreme Being in having the sovereign, the head of the civil authority, described as a believer in and a defender of the faith in a supreme ruler.\\" Also, while the sovereign holds the nominal title Head of the Commonwealth, this does not imply any political power over member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. In keeping, however, with the declaration of the prime ministers of the Commonwealth in London in 1949 of \\"the King as the symbol of the free association of its independent member nations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth,\\" the title will pass to the next monarch upon the demise of the Crown, though this is not a guaranteed certainty. Style of address The use of the styles of address Highness and Majesty originated in the United Kingdom, where they were used from the 12th century onward. During the reign of James VI of Scotland and I of England and Ireland, however, Majesty became the official style, to the exclusion of all others, and it was then brought to North America during colonial times through usage in reference to the British monarch, who then had sovereignty over the colonies on that continent. Its usage has continued since Canada became a kingdom in its own right in 1867, and after a process of constitutional evolution ending with full sovereignty from the United Kingdom, is now applied to the Canadian monarch. Unlike in the United Kingdom, where the sovereign is referred to in treaties and on British passports as Her [His] Britannic Majesty, the sovereign in Canada is referred to simply as Her [His] Majesty (). However, from time to time, the style will be Her [His] Canadian Majesty so as to differentiate from foreign sovereigns. Canadian styles of address are officially maintained by the Department of Canadian Heritage's Protocol Office. History Following Canadian Confederation, Prime Minister of Canada John A. Macdonald, having been denied the name Kingdom of Canada for the new country, was repeatedly heard to refer to Queen Victoria as the Queen of Canada, and, similarly, in the lead up to the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902, Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier desired to have the words King of Canada included in the royal title by the time of the ceremony. This wish was not fulfilled, however, and Canada inherited the full British title when the country gained legislative independence from the United Kingdom in 1931. Elizabeth II, the first Canadian monarch to be titled Queen of Canada Liberal Member of Parliament Eugène Marquis in 1945 tabled a motion in the House of Commons proposing that a change to the King's title be a subject of discussion at the next Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference; Marquis suggested that the title include each of the King's dominions, giving him the designation King of Canada. But, the motion did not pass and it was only in 1948 that form of address changed, when the Canadian parliament passed in 1947 its own Royal Style and Titles Act and an Order in Council was issued on 22 June the following year to remove the term Emperor of India from the sovereign's Canadian title. In 1949, it was suggested by Cabinet that the King's title be altered so that in Canada it would be George the Sixth, by the Grace of God, of Canada and the other nations of the British Commonwealth, King; but, again, nothing came of the proposal. At the time, Robert Gordon Robertson, then a member of the Cabinet Secretariat, opined that Canadians would not like the title King of Canada, as \\"most Canadians... have not thought of themselves as citizens of either a republic or a monarchy.\\" Still, in 1950, when William Ferdinand Alphonse Turgeon was sent to Ireland as Canada's ambassador to that country, the Cabinet wished to have George VI referred to in the letters of credence as King of Canada. The King's secretaries objected strongly, claiming the monarch had only one title in law and Turgeon's letters eventually used George's full legal title, which referred to him as sovereign of Great Britain and \\"Ireland.\\" The proclamations of Elizabeth II's accession to the throne in February 1952 differed between Canada and the United Kingdom; in the latter, the new queen was referred to unconventionally as Queen Elizabeth II by the Grace of God, Queen of this Realm, and of Her other Realms and Territories, while the Canadian Privy Council adhered to the letter of the law, calling the sovereign Elizabeth the Second by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas. The discrepancies between independent countries sharing one person as sovereign prompted discussions amongst the Commonwealth prime ministers before a meeting in London, England, in December 1952; Canada's then prime minister, Louis St. Laurent, stated that it was important a new composition for the royal title be agreed upon by all realms involved, to \\"emphasise the fact that the Queen is Queen of Canada, regardless of her sovereignty over other Commonwealth countries.\\" Canada's preferred format was: Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, Queen of Canada and of Her other realms and territories, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith; the Canadian government preferred to keep the word \\"queen\\" next to \\"Canada\\", as it made the sovereign's role as monarch of Canada more clear than having \\"queen\\" follow several words on after the country's name. However, as Australian ministers wished to have the United Kingdom mentioned in all the Queen's titles, the resolution reached was a designation that included the United Kingdom as well as, for the first time, reference to Canada and the other Commonwealth realms separately. When the Royal Style and Titles Act of 1953 was debated in the House of Commons, St. Laurent asserted on the nature of the separate and shared characteristics of the Crown: \\"Her Majesty is now Queen of Canada but she is the Queen of Canada because she is Queen of the United Kingdom... It is not a separate office.\\" Parliament then unanimously passed the new legislation consenting to the issuance of a royal proclamation establishing the monarch's royal titles. The relevant royal proclamation establishing the titles was issued on May 28, just four days before Elizabeth II was crowned. The new legislation conferred publicly and legally the reality of a unique constitutional monarchy for Canada, thereby fulfilling the vision of the Fathers of Confederation.

Overview Walter was born in Kansas City, Missouri, United States, in 1910. His ancestry was German/British on his father's side, and American/British on his mother's side. He was brought to England in 1915, and educated at Westminster School and afterwards in King's College, Cambridge, in 1931. He failed to obtain a research fellowship in Cambridge and so turned to doing basic and applied neurophysiological research in hospitals, in London, from 1935 to 1939 and then at the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol, from 1939 to 1970. He also carried out research work in the United States, in the Soviet Union and in various other places in Europe. He married twice, had two sons from his first marriage, and one from the second. According to his eldest son, Nicolas Walter, \\"he was politically on the left, a communist fellow-traveller before the Second World War and an anarchist sympathiser after it.\\" Throughout his life he was a pioneer in the field of cybernetics. In 1970, he suffered a brain injury in a motor scooter accident. He never fully recovered and died seven years later, on May 6, 1977. Brain waves As a young man, Walter was greatly influenced by the work of the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov. He visited the lab of Hans Berger, who invented the electroencephalograph, or EEG machine, for measuring electrical activity in the brain. Walter produced his own versions of Berger's machine with improved capabilities, which allowed it to detect a variety of brain wave types ranging from the high speed alpha waves to the slow delta waves observed during sleep. In the 1930s, Walter made a number of discoveries using his EEG machines at Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol. He was the first to determine by triangulation the surface location of the strongest alpha waves within the occipital lobe (alpha waves originate from the thalamus deep within the brain). Walter demonstrated the use of delta waves to locate brain tumours or lesions responsible for epilepsy. He developed the first brain topography machine based on EEG, using on an array of spiral-scan CRTs connected to high-gain amplifiers. During the Second World War, Walter worked on scanning radar technology and guided missiles, which may have influenced his subsequent alpha wave scanning hypothesis of brain activity. In the 1960s, Walter also went on to discover the contingent negative variation (CNV) effect whereby a negative spike of electrical activity appears in the brain half a second prior to a person being consciously aware of movements they were about to make. Intriguingly, this effect brings into question the very notion of consciousness or free will, and should be considered as part of a person's overall reaction time to events. Walter's experiments with stroboscopic light, described in The Living Brain, inspired the development of a Dream Machine by the artist Brion Gysin and technician Ian Sommerville. Robots Grey Walter's most well-known work was his construction of some of the first electronic autonomous robots. He wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors - essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, which he used to call Machina speculatrix and named Elmer and Elsie - ELectroMEchanical Robot, Light-Sensitive, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described as tortoises due to their shape and slow rate of movement - and because they \\"taught us\\" about the secrets of organisation and life. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable of phototaxis, by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power. In one experiment, Walter placed a light on the \\"nose\\" of a tortoise and watched as the robot observed itself in a mirror. \\"It began flickering,\\" he wrote. \\"Twittering, and jigging like a clumsy Narcissus.\\" Walter argued that if it were seen in an animal it \\"might be accepted as evidence of some degree of self-awareness.\\" One of the tortoises was modified, (given the pretend scientific name Machina docilis) and had added to its simple single celled \\"brain\\" one, then two conditional reflex circuits in which they could be taught simple behaviors similar to Ivan Pavlov's dogs. This tortoise was called CORA. One of these included being hit meant food whilst whistling means food, and when conditioned such a whistle by itself means being hit. When he added another circuit tuned to a whistle of another pitch, this could become whistle means being hit, whistle means food, this would make the animal become \\"afraid\\" whenever food was presented. Walter remedied this behaviour by severing the two additional circuits, and the tortoise reverted to being a Machina speculatrix. The conditioned reflex behaviour was later placed into a static desktop model, also known as CORA. Later versions of Machina speculatrix were exhibited at the Festival of Britain in 1951. Walter stressed the importance of using purely analogue electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his contemporaries such as Alan Turing and John von Neumann were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation. His work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers, including Rodney Brooks, Hans Moravec and Mark Tilden. Modern incarnations of Walter's turtles may be found in the form of BEAM robotics. In 2000, an original tortoise went on display in London, UK, in the Science Museum.Holland, Owen. \\"Exploration and high adventure: The legacy of Grey Walter.\\" Philosophical Transactions of The Royal Society A Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences · November 2003. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9025611_Exploration_and_high_adventure_The_legacy_of_Grey_Walter Recently, one was also replicated by Dr Owen Holland, of the University of the West of England in 1995, using some of the original parts. An original tortoise as seen at the Festival of Britain is in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.

It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road in South Kensington, the others being the Science Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Natural History Museum's main frontage, however, is on Cromwell Road. The museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising some 80 million items within five main collections: botany, entomology, mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology. The museum is a centre of research specialising in taxonomy, identification and conservation. Given the age of the institution, many of the collections have great historical as well as scientific value, such as specimens collected by Charles Darwin. The museum is particularly famous for its exhibition of dinosaur skeletons and ornate architecture—sometimes dubbed a cathedral of nature—both exemplified by the large Diplodocus cast that dominated the vaulted central hall before it was replaced in 2017 with the skeleton of a blue whale hanging from the ceiling. The Natural History Museum Library contains extensive books, journals, manuscripts, and artwork collections linked to the work and research of the scientific departments; access to the library is by appointment only. The museum is recognised as the pre-eminent centre of natural history and research of related fields in the world. Although commonly referred to as the Natural History Museum, it was officially known as British Museum (Natural History) until 1992, despite legal separation from the British Museum itself in 1963. Originating from collections within the British Museum, the landmark Alfred Waterhouse building was built and opened by 1881 and later incorporated the Geological Museum. The Darwin Centre is a more recent addition, partly designed as a modern facility for storing the valuable collections. Like other publicly funded national museums in the United Kingdom, the Natural History Museum does not charge an admission fee. (It did but was scrapped in 2001) https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1331446/Natural-History-Museum- scraps-9-fee.html The museum is an exempt charity and a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, is a patron of the museum. There are approximately 850 staff at the museum. The two largest strategic groups are the Public Engagement Group and Science Group. History Early history An 1881 plan showing the original arrangement of the museum. This plan was re- drawn by Naama Ferstenfeld based on original plans in the museum's collection.

The foundation of the collection was that of the Ulster doctor Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), who allowed his significant collections to be purchased by the British Government at a price well below their market value at the time. This purchase was funded by a lottery. Sloane's collection, which included dried plants, and animal and human skeletons, was initially housed in Montagu House, Bloomsbury, in 1756, which was the home of the British Museum. Most of the Sloane collection had disappeared by the early decades of the nineteenth century. Dr George Shaw (Keeper of Natural History 1806–13) sold many specimens to the Royal College of Surgeons and had periodic cremations of material in the grounds of the museum. His successors also applied to the trustees for permission to destroy decayed specimens. In 1833, the Annual Report states that, of the 5,500 insects listed in the Sloane catalogue, none remained. The inability of the natural history departments to conserve its specimens became notorious: the Treasury refused to entrust it with specimens collected at the government's expense. Appointments of staff were bedevilled by gentlemanly favouritism; in 1862 a nephew of the mistress of a Trustee was appointed Entomological Assistant despite not knowing the difference between a butterfly and a moth. J. E. Gray (Keeper of Zoology 1840–74) complained of the incidence of mental illness amongst staff: George Shaw threatened to put his foot on any shell not in the 12th edition of Linnaeus' Systema Naturae; another had removed all the labels and registration numbers from entomological cases arranged by a rival. The huge collection of the conchologist Hugh Cuming was acquired by the museum, and Gray's own wife had carried the open trays across the courtyard in a gale: all the labels blew away. That collection is said never to have recovered. The Principal Librarian at the time was Antonio Panizzi; his contempt for the natural history departments and for science in general was total. The general public was not encouraged to visit the museum's natural history exhibits. In 1835 to a Select Committee of Parliament, Sir Henry Ellis said this policy was fully approved by the Principal Librarian and his senior colleagues. Many of these faults were corrected by the palaeontologist Richard Owen, appointed Superintendent of the natural history departments of the British Museum in 1856. His changes led Bill Bryson to write that \\"by making the Natural History Museum an institution for everyone, Owen transformed our expectations of what museums are for\\". Planning and architecture of new building The Natural History Museum, shown in wide-angle view here, has an ornate terracotta facade by Gibbs and Canning Limited typical of high Victorian architecture. The terracotta mouldings represent the past and present diversity of nature. Owen saw that the natural history departments needed more space, and that implied a separate building as the British Museum site was limited. Land in South Kensington was purchased, and in 1864 a competition was held to design the new museum. The winning entry was submitted by the civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke, who died shortly afterwards. The scheme was taken over by Alfred Waterhouse who substantially revised the agreed plans, and designed the façades in his own idiosyncratic Romanesque style which was inspired by his frequent visits to the Continent. The original plans included wings on either side of the main building, but these plans were soon abandoned for budgetary reasons. The space these would have occupied are now taken by the Earth Galleries and Darwin Centre. Work began in 1873 and was completed in 1880. The new museum opened in 1881, although the move from the old museum was not fully completed until 1883. Both the interiors and exteriors of the Waterhouse building make extensive use of architectural terracotta tiles to resist the sooty atmosphere of Victorian London, manufactured by the Tamworth-based company of Gibbs and Canning Limited. The tiles and bricks feature many relief sculptures of flora and fauna, with living and extinct species featured within the west and east wings respectively. This explicit separation was at the request of Owen, and has been seen as a statement of his contemporary rebuttal of Darwin's attempt to link present species with past through the theory of natural selection. The central axis of the museum is aligned with the tower of Imperial College London (formerly the Imperial Institute) and the Royal Albert Hall and Albert Memorial further north. These all form part of the complex known colloquially as Albertopolis. Separation from the British Museum The central hall of the museum Even after the opening, the Natural History Museum legally remained a department of the British Museum with the formal name British Museum (Natural History), usually abbreviated in the scientific literature as B.M.(N.H.). A petition to the Chancellor of the Exchequer was made in 1866, signed by the heads of the Royal, Linnean and Zoological societies as well as naturalists including Darwin, Wallace and Huxley, asking that the museum gain independence from the board of the British Museum, and heated discussions on the matter continued for nearly one hundred years. Finally, with the passing of the British Museum Act 1963, the British Museum (Natural History) became an independent museum with its own board of trustees, although – despite a proposed amendment to the act in the House of Lords – the former name was retained. In 1989 the museum publicly re-branded itself as the Natural History Museum and effectively stopped using the title British Museum (Natural History) on its advertising and its books for general readers. Only with the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 did the museum's formal title finally change to the Natural History Museum. Geological Museum In 1976, the museum absorbed the adjacent Geological Museum of the British Geological Survey, which had long competed for the limited space available in the area. The Geological Museum became world-famous for exhibitions including an active volcano model and an earthquake machine (designed by James Gardner), and housed the world's first computer-enhanced exhibition (Treasures of the Earth). The museum's galleries were completely rebuilt and relaunched in 1996 as The Earth Galleries, with the other exhibitions in the Waterhouse building retitled The Life Galleries. The Natural History Museum's own mineralogy displays remain largely unchanged as an example of the 19th-century display techniques of the Waterhouse building. The central atrium design by Neal Potter overcame visitors' reluctance to visit the upper galleries by \\"pulling\\" them through a model of the Earth made up of random plates on an escalator. The new design covered the walls in recycled slate and sandblasted the major stars and planets onto the wall. The museum's 'star' geological exhibits are displayed within the walls. Six iconic figures were the backdrop to discussing how previous generations have viewed Earth. These were later removed to make place for a Stegosaurus skeleton that was put on display in late 2015. The Darwin Centre Statue of Charles Darwin by Sir Joseph Boehm in the main hall The Darwin Centre (named after Charles Darwin) was designed as a new home for the museum's collection of tens of millions of preserved specimens, as well as new work spaces for the museum's scientific staff and new educational visitor experiences. Built in two distinct phases, with two new buildings adjacent to the main Waterhouse building, it is the most significant new development project in the museum's history. Phase one of the Darwin Centre opened to the public in 2002, and it houses the zoological department's 'spirit collections'—organisms preserved in alcohol. Phase Two was unveiled in September 2008 and opened to the general public in September 2009. It was designed by the Danish architecture practice C. F. Møller Architects in the shape of a giant, eight-story cocoon and houses the entomology and botanical collections—the 'dry collections'. It is possible for members of the public to visit and view non-exhibited items for a fee by booking onto one of the several Spirit Collection Tours offered daily. Arguably the most famous creature in the centre is the 8.62-metre-long giant squid, affectionately named Archie. The Attenborough Studio As part of the museum's remit to communicate science education and conservation work, a new multimedia studio will form an important part of Darwin Centre Phase 2. In collaboration with the BBC's Natural History Unit (holder of the largest archive of natural history footage) the Attenborough Studio—named after the broadcaster Sir David Attenborough—provides a multimedia environment for educational events. The studio holds regular lectures and demonstrations, including free Nature Live talks on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.  Major specimens and exhibits  One of the most famous and certainly most prominent of the exhibits—nicknamed \\"Dippy\\"—is a -long replica of a Diplodocus carnegii skeleton which was on display for many years within the central hall. The cast was given as a gift by the Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie, after a discussion with King Edward VII, then a keen trustee of the British Museum. Carnegie paid £2,000 for the casting, copying the original held at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The pieces were sent to London in 36 crates, and on 12 May 1905, the exhibit was unveiled to great public and media interest. The real fossil had yet to be mounted, as the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh was still being constructed to house it. As word of Dippy spread, Mr Carnegie paid to have additional copies made for display in most major European capitals and in Latin and South America, making Dippy the most-viewed dinosaur skeleton in the world. The dinosaur quickly became an iconic representation of the museum, and has featured in many cartoons and other media, including the 1975 Disney comedy One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing. After 112 years on display at the museum, the dinosaur replica was removed in early 2017 to be replaced by the actual skeleton of a young blue whale, a 128-year-old skeleton nicknamed \\"Hope\\". Dippy went on a tour of various British museums starting in 2018 and concluding in 2020 at Norwich Cathedral. alt= The blue whale skeleton, Hope, that has replaced Dippy, is another prominent display in the museum. The display of the skeleton, some long and weighing 4.5 tonnes, was only made possible in 1934 with the building of the New Whale Hall (now the Mammals (blue whale model) gallery). The whale had been in storage for 42 years since its stranding on sandbanks at the mouth of Wexford Harbour, Ireland in March 1891 after being injured by whalers. At this time, it was first displayed in the Mammals (blue whale model) gallery, but now takes pride of place in the museum's Hintze Hall. Discussion of the idea of a life-sized model also began around 1934, and work was undertaken within the Whale Hall itself. Since taking a cast of such a large animal was deemed prohibitively expensive, scale models were used to meticulously piece the structure together. During construction, workmen left a trapdoor within the whale's stomach, which they would use for surreptitious cigarette breaks. Before the door was closed and sealed forever, some coins and a telephone directory were placed inside—this soon growing to an urban myth that a time capsule was left inside. The work was completed—entirely within the hall and in view of the public—in 1938. At the time it was the largest such model in the world, at in length. The construction details were later borrowed by several American museums, who scaled the plans further. The work involved in removing Dippy and replacing it with Hope was documented in a BBC Television special, Horizon: Dippy and the Whale, narrated by David Attenborough, which was first broadcast on BBC Two on 13 July 2017, the day before Hope was unveiled for public display. A blue whale skeleton—nicknamed \\"Hope\\"—installed in Hintze Hall, 2017 The Darwin Centre is host to Archie, an 8.62-metre-long giant squid taken alive in a fishing net near the Falkland Islands in 2004. The squid is not on general display, but stored in the large tank room in the basement of the Phase 1 building. It is possible for members of the public to visit and view non- exhibited items behind the scenes for a fee by booking onto one of the several Spirit Collection Tours offered daily. On arrival at the museum, the specimen was immediately frozen while preparations commenced for its permanent storage. Since few complete and reasonably fresh examples of the species exist, \\"wet storage\\" was chosen, leaving the squid undissected. A 9.45-metre acrylic tank was constructed (by the same team that provide tanks to Damien Hirst), and the body preserved using a mixture of formalin and saline solution. The museum holds the remains and bones of the \\"River Thames whale\\", a northern bottlenose whale that lost its way on 20 January 2006 and swam into the Thames. Although primarily used for research purposes, and held at the museum's storage site at Wandsworth. Dinocochlea, one of the longer-standing mysteries of paleontology (originally thought to be a giant gastropod shell, then a coprolite, and now a concretion of a worm's tunnel), has been part of the collection since its discovery in 1921. The museum keeps a wildlife garden on its west lawn, on which a potentially new species of insect resembling Arocatus roeselii was discovered in 2007. Galleries alt= A balcony view of the Large Mammals Hall ;Red Zone This is the zone that can be entered from Exhibition Road, on the East side of the building. It is a gallery themed around the changing history of the Earth. Earth's Treasury shows specimens of rocks, minerals and gemstones behind glass in a dimly lit gallery.

These include for example a highly praised \\"How Science Works\\" hands on workshop for school students demonstrating the use of microfossils in geological research. The museum also played a major role in securing designation of the Jurassic Coast of Devon and Dorset as a UNESCO World Heritage site and has subsequently been a lead partner in the Lyme Regis Fossil Festivals. In 2005, the museum launched a project to develop notable gallery characters to patrol display cases, including 'facsimiles' of luminaries such as Carl Linnaeus, Mary Anning, Dorothea Bate and William Smith. They tell stories and anecdotes of their lives and discoveries and aim to surprise visitors.Review by Miles Russell of Discovering Dorothea: the Life of the Pioneering Fossil-Hunter Dorothea Bate by Karolyn Shindler at ucl.ac.uk (accessed 23 November 2007) In 2010, a six-part BBC documentary series was filmed at the museum entitled Museum of Life exploring the history and behind the scenes aspects of the museum. Since May 2001, the Natural History Museum admission has been free for some events and permanent exhibitions. However, there are certain temporary exhibits and shows that require a fee. The Natural History museum combines the museum's life and earth science collections with specialist expertise in \\"taxonomy, systematics, biodiversity, natural resources, planetary science, evolution and informatics\\" to tackle scientific questions. In 2011, the museum led the setting up of an International Union for the Conservation of Nature Bumblebee Specialist Group, chaired by Dr. Paul H. Williams, to assess the threat status of bumblebee species worldwide using Red List criteria. Access {  - ! Service !! Station/Stop !!

A connecting bridge between the Natural History and Science museums closed to the public in the late 1990s. In fiction The museum is a prominent setting in Charlie Fletcher's children's book trilogy about \\"unLondon\\" called Stoneheart. George Chapman, the hero, sneaks outside when punished on a school trip; he breaks off a small dragon's stone head from a relief and is chased by a pterodactyl, which comes to life from a statue on the roof. The museum is the primary setting for Rattle His Bones, the eighth Daisy Dalrymple Mystery by Carola Dunn. The story revolves around a murder and jewel theft occurring during the time Daisy Dalrymple is writing a story about the museum for an American publisher. The museum plays an important role in the London-based Disney live- action feature One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing; the eponymous skeleton is stolen from the museum, and a group of intrepid nannies hide inside the mouth of the museum's blue whale model (in fact a specially created prop – the nannies peer out from behind the whale's teeth, but a blue whale is a baleen whale and has no teeth). Additionally, the film is set in the 1920s, before the blue whale model was built. In the 2014 film Paddington, the villain is Millicent Clyde a taxidermist at the museum. She kidnaps Paddington, intending to kill and stuff him, but is thwarted by the Brown family after scenes involving chases inside and on the roof of the building. In the first episode of the third season of the TV series Penny Dreadful (2014–2016), the main character, Vanessa Ives (Eva Green), visits the museum after her psychotherapist tells her to \\"go somewhere different\\". There, she meets Dr. Alexander Sweet (Christian Camargo), who is a zoologist and the Director of Zoological Studies. The museum is frequently seen in the following episodes as Vanessa and Dr. Sweet's relationship flourishes. Andy Day's CBeebies shows, Andy's Dinosaur Adventures and Andy's Prehistoric Adventures are filmed in the Natural History Museum. Natural History Museum at Tring The NHM also has an outpost in Tring, Hertfordshire, built by local eccentric Lionel Walter Rothschild. The NHM took ownership in 1938. In 2007, the museum announced that the name would be changed to the Natural History Museum at Tring, though the older name, the Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum, is still in widespread use.

Early life On March 5, 1839, Silas Comfort Swallow was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania to George Swallow, a trustee of Wyoming Seminary, and Sarah Thompson and was named after Methodist preacher Silas Comfort (1803–1868), an anti-slavery member of the Genesee, Oneida and Missouri Conferences. While serving in St. Louis, Missouri, Swallow admitted as evidence in a church trial the testimony of a Negro, a practice which was forbidden in public trials in Missouri at the time. He was censured by his Conference, but that censure was overturned by the 1840 General Conference. The General Conference then bowed to Southern pressure and passed a resolution prohibiting the testimony of Negroes in church trials within states that forbade such testimony in public trials. That resolution was rescinded in 1844. Before entering the ministry, Silas was employed as a school teacher from the age of 16 to 21 and later studied law. Career In 1862, he enlisted into the Union Army and served as a First lieutenant in the 18th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. He entered the Baltimore Conference in 1863 and became a charter member of the Central Pennsylvania Conference upon its organization in 1869. On January 20, 1866, he married Rebecca Louise Robins. He worked a church builder, presiding elder, and editor of The Central Pennsylvania Methodist. As editor he attacked alcohol, spiritual indifference, and political corruption in the state government that led to him being prosecuted and convicted of slander and fined $500 in 1897, but the verdict was later reversed by the State Superior Court. In 1901 he was criticized for a recent editorial critical of William McKinley that was released shortly after his death. Silas Comfort Swallow Politics He was the Prohibition Party's candidate for Mayor of Harrisburg, state legislature, State Treasurer, and Governor of Pennsylvania. When he ran for governor of Pennsylvania in 1898 he received the nomination of the Prohibition, People's, Liberty, and Honest Government parties and received 13% in the general election. In 1901, he received a single vote for Senator from state representative L. D. Brown. During the 1900 presidential election he ran for the Prohibition Party's presidential nomination, but was narrowly defeated by John G. Woolley after Hale Johnson withdrew before balloting and endorsed Woolley. During the 1904 presidential election it was initially believed that General Nelson A. Miles would be the Prohibition Party's presidential nominee, but one hour before the convention was to vote he sent a telegram refusing to allow the delegates to vote for him. Swallow, who was supposed to serve as an at-large delegate for Pennsylvania, but was unable to attend due to his wife's poor health, was voted on instead and given the nomination by acclamation. It was speculated that he might not accept the nomination, but after his wife's health improved he accepted it and appeared on the ticket with his running mate George Washington Carroll. In the general election he received 259,102 votes which is the second highest popular vote total for the party. Death Swallow died at his home in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on August 13, 1930, from old age and was interred at Paxtang Cemetery near Harrisburg. Church service Dr. Swallow's official conference service record lists the following appointments: *1863–1864 Milton circuit. *1864–1866 Berwick. *1866–1868 Catawissa. *1868–1871 Newberry. *1871–1873 Williamsport Third Street. *1873–1875 Milton. *1875–1877 Altoona Eighth Avenue. *1877–1881 presiding elder, Altoona District. *1881–1884 York First. *1884–1886 Williamsport Grace. *1886–1887 agent, Dickinson College. *1887–1892 Harrisburg Ridge Avenue. *1892–1902 superintendent, Harrisburg Methodist book room. *1902–1908 no appointment, by request. *1908–1930 retired. Writings Being an editor, Swallow made certain that his life story was recorded for posterity. Upon reaching his 70th birthday in 1909, he published a 482-page hardback autobiography: III Score and X – Selections, Collections, Recollections of Seventy Busy Years. This proved to be so successful that he came out with periodic updates as follows: *Toasts and Roasts of III Score and X, 1911. *Then and Now – Some Reminiscences of an Octogenarian, 1919. *IV Score and More, 1922. Other booklets and pamphlets by Swallow, all of which are preserved in the archives of the Central Pennsylvania Conference of the United Methodist Church, range in date and content from his 1879 Camp Meetings and the Sabbath to his 1917 A Sermon on Thanksgiving and Thanksliving.

He also played flumpet, a trumpet–flugelhorn combination especially designed for him. He and his identical twin brother, double bassist Addison Farmer, started playing professionally while in high school. Art gained greater attention after the release of a recording of his composition \\"Farmer's Market\\" in 1952. He subsequently moved from Los Angeles to New York, where he performed and recorded with musicians such as Horace Silver, Sonny Rollins, and Gigi Gryce and became known principally as a bebop player. As Farmer's reputation grew, he expanded from bebop into more experimental forms through working with composers such as George Russell and Teddy Charles. He went on to join Gerry Mulligan's quartet and, with Benny Golson, to co-found the Jazztet. Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, and he helped to establish the flugelhorn as a soloist's instrument in jazz.Feather, Leonard (March 30, 1990) \\"Jazz Review: Art Farmer's Fluegelhorn of Plenty\\". Los Angeles Times. He settled in Europe in 1968 and continued to tour internationally until his death. Farmer recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with other leaders. His playing is known for its individuality – most noticeably, its lyricism, warmth of tone and sensitivity. Early life Art Farmer was born an hour before his twin brother, on August 21, 1928, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, reportedly at 2201 Fourth Avenue.Ramsey, William E. & Shrier, Betty Dineen (2002) Silent Hills Speak: A History of Council Bluffs Barnhart Press. Cited in: Longden, Tom \\"Art Farmer\\". DesMoinesRegister.com Their parents, James Arthur Farmer and Hazel Stewart Farmer, divorced when the boys were four, and their steelworker father was killed in a work accident not long after this. Art moved with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, brother and sister to Phoenix, Arizona when he was still four.\\"Art Farmer: NEA Jazz Master (1999)\\". (June 29–30, 1995) Smithsonian Jazz Oral History Program NEA Jazz Master interview. He started to play the piano while in elementary school, then moved on to bass tuba and violin before settling on cornet and then trumpet at the age of thirteen.Bryant, Clora (1998) Central Avenue Sounds: Jazz in Los Angeles. University of California Press. His family was musical: most of them played as a hobby, and one was a professional trombonist. Art's grandfather was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This influenced Farmer's first choice of instrument, as his mother played piano for the church choir. The bass tuba was for use in a marching band and was Farmer's instrument for a year, until a cornet became available. Phoenix schools were segregated, and no one at Farmer's school could provide useful music lessons. He taught himself to read music and practiced his new main instrument, the trumpet. Farmer and his brother moved to Los Angeles in 1945, attending the music-oriented Jefferson High School, where they got music instruction and met other developing musicians such as Sonny Criss, Ernie Andrews, Big Jay McNeely, and Ed Thigpen. The brothers earned money by working in a cold-storage warehouse and by playing professionally. Art started playing trumpet professionally at the age of 16, performing in the bands of Horace Henderson, Jimmy Mundy, and Floyd Ray, among others.Rosenthal, David (1993) Hard Bop: Jazz and Black Music, 1955–1965. pp. 85–94. Oxford University Press. These opportunities came about through a combination of his ability and the absence of numerous older musicians, who were still in the armed forces following World War II. Around this time in Los Angeles, there were abundant opportunities for musical development, according to Farmer: \\"During the day you would go to somebody's house and play. At night there were after-hours clubs [...and] anybody who wanted to play was free to come up and play\\".Berliner, Paul F. (2009) Thinking in Jazz: The Infinite Art of Improvisation. University of Chicago Press. Farmer left high school early but persuaded the principal to give him a diploma, which he did not collect until a visit to the school in 1958. At this time, as an adolescent in Los Angeles, bebop and the swing era big bands both attracted Farmer's attention. Decades later, he stated that, at that time, \\"I knew I had to be in jazz. Two things decided me – the sound of a trumpet section in a big band and hearing a jam session\\". Farmer's trumpet influences in the 1940s were Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and Fats Navarro, but, in his own words, \\"then I heard Freddie Webster, and I loved his sound. I decided to work on sound because it seemed like most of the guys my age were just working on speed\\".Robinson, Greg (October 1994) \\"Art Farmer: Playing It Right\\". JazzTimes. pp. 47–48, 53. Later life and career Early career in Los Angeles and New York Farmer left school to tour with a group led by Johnny Otis, but this job lasted for only four months, as Farmer's lip gave out. Performing for long periods seven days a week for this job put great pressure on his technique, which was insufficiently developed to cope with such physical demands. His lip eventually became lacerated, and he could no longer play. He then received technique training in New York, where he worked for a time as a janitor and played as a freelance musician during 1947 and 1948. An audition for Dizzy Gillespie's big band was unsuccessful, and Farmer returned to the West Coast in 1948 as a member of Jay McShann's band. Club and studio work was hard to get in Los Angeles from the late 1940s and into the 1950s, as it was dominated by white musicians. Farmer played and toured with Benny Carter, Roy Porter and Gerald Wilson, then played with Wardell Gray in 1951–52.Feather, Leonard & Gitler, Ira (2007) The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz. p. 219. Oxford University Press. The hazards of the touring jazz musician's lifestyle were also present: while travelling overnight by car between Phoenix and El Paso, to get to another Roy Porter-led gig, the car that Farmer was in overturned at high speed, leaving him concussed and Porter with broken ribs.Porter, Ray (1995) There and Back. pp. 167–168. Continuum International. Farmer's first studio recording appears to have been on June 28 or July 2, 1948, in Los Angeles, under the leadership of vocalist Big Joe Turner and pianist Pete Johnson. They recorded \\"Radar Blues\\", and at some point in the same or the following year they added a further seven sides; the eight tracks were released as four singles by Swing Time Records.Jepson, Jorgen Grumet (ed.)

Farmer recorded further singles with Roy Porter and then, on January 21, 1952, as a member of Wardell Gray's sextet. The latter session produced six tracks that were released as singles.

From the middle of the 1950s, Farmer featured in recordings by leading arrangers of the day, including George Russell, Quincy Jones and Oliver Nelson, being in demand because of his reputation for being able to play anything. The wide range of styles these arrangers represented was extended when Farmer took part in a series of experimental sessions with composer Edgard Varèse in 1957. Varèse used approximate notation and wanted the musicians to improvise within its structure; at least some of the seasoned jazz musicians present regarded this process of creation as similar to their own familiar creations of spontaneously produced head arrangements, but their efforts influenced Varèse's composition, Poème électronique.Mattis, Olivia (2006) \\"From Bebop to Poo-Wip: Jazz Influences in Varèse's Poème électronique\\".

Farmer formed the Jazztet in 1959, with the composer and tenor saxophonist Benny Golson, after each man independently came to the conclusion that the other should be a member of his new sextet. The Jazztet lasted until 1962, recorded several albums for Argo and Mercury Records, and assisted in the early careers of pianist McCoy Tyner and trombonist Grachan Moncur III. In the early 1960s Farmer established a trio with guitarist Jim Hall and bassist Steve Swallow; his relationship with Hall lasted from 1962 to 1964, and included two tours of Europe, one of which had concerts recorded for the BBC's Jazz 625 programme, which were later released on DVD.Krow, Jeff (October 30, 2009) \\"Art Farmer – Live in 1964 – (Jazz Icons IV Series)\\" .

Hall left the second tour while the quartet, which included Swallow and drummer Pete La Roca, was engaged in Berlin, and a pianist replaced him; this was ultimately Steve Kuhn. In 1964, this new quartet recorded the album Sing Me Softly of the Blues for the Atlantic label. These bands played laid back, melodious music during a period when avant-garde jazz was becoming more common.\\"Art Farmer\\" (February 1975) Buffalo Jazz Report. p. 1. Farmer toured Europe in 1965–66, then returned to the US and led a small group with Jimmy Heath. His stylistic development continued during this period of his career, in part because he \\"absorbed, understood, and had the technical and artistic gifts to put to personal use the [John] Coltrane innovations of the 'Giant Steps' period of the early 1960s\\". Work opportunities, however, were diminishing as rock became more popular in the mid-1960s, so Farmer joined the pit orchestra of Elliot Lawrence for the production of The Apple Tree on Broadway, for six months. Career after permanent move to Europe The visits to Europe continued. Farmer moved there in 1968 and ultimately settled in Vienna, where he performed with The Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band and joined the Austrian Radio Orchestra. The latter job initially required only ten days a month of his time, so he was able to play with other well-known expatriates such as Don Byas, Dexter Gordon, and Ben Webster. As the orchestra's music gradually changed in style from jazz to simpler forms and took up more of Farmer's time, he found that it was getting in the way of his musical ambitions, so he left after three or four years. Pursuing these ambitions meant that Farmer traveled extensively worldwide. He said in 1976 that \\"I'm traveling 90 percent of the time. I can live anywhere. It's just a matter of getting to the airport\\".Fraser, Gerald C. (August 26, 1976) \\"Art Farmer Finds Jazz in Europe Challenging\\" The New York Times. p. 39. A 1982 revival of the Jazztet, with Golson, led him to play more frequently in the United States than he had over the previous decade.Mathieson, Kenny (2012) Cookin': Hard Bop and Soul Jazz 1954–65: Hard Bop and Soul Jazz 1954–65. Canongate. In the 1980s Farmer also created a quintet, featuring saxophonist Clifford Jordan, that toured internationally. In the early 1980s, Farmer had also made some changes to his lifestyle. Interviewed for a 1985 article in The New Yorker, he reported losing 30 pounds in weight a couple of years earlier, and stopping smoking and drinking a couple of years before that; Farmer \\"used to think he couldn't play without drinking; now he couldn't play and drink\\", was the interviewer's summary of Farmer's habits, which appear to have avoided the drug-related problems of many of his contemporaries.Gitler, Ira (1966) Jazz Masters of the Forties. p. 272. Collins Books. From the early 1990s, Farmer had a second house in New York and divided his time between Vienna and there. He had regular gigs with Clifford Jordan at the Sweet Basil Jazz Club and, later, with Ran Blake and Jerome Richardson at the Village Vanguard, both in New York. Farmer was awarded the Austrian Gold Medal of Merit in 1994. In the same year, a concert in honor of his achievements was held at the Alice Tully Hall in New York.Watrous, Peter (August 8, 1994) \\"Jazz Review; Players Play to Honor Art Farmer\\". The New York Times. Farmer also recorded extensively as a leader throughout his later career, including some pieces of classical music with US and European orchestras. Farmer's level of playing even towards the end of his career was noted in a review by Scott Yanow of one of his last recordings, Silk Road, from 1996: \\"the warm-toned and swinging Farmer is consistently the main star, and at age 68 he proves to still be in his prime\\". In 1999 Farmer was selected as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master. A few months later, on October 4, Farmer died of a heart attack at home in Manhattan, aged 71.Heckman, Don & Thurber, Jon (October 7, 1999) \\"Art Farmer: Eloquent Jazz Master of the Trumpet and Fluegelhorn\\".

They divorced after about a year, but the marriage produced one son, Arthur Jr, who died in 1994. Farmer's second wife was a distant cousin; this marriage also ended in divorce. He married again, to a Viennese banker named Mechtilde Lawgger, and their son, Georg, was born in the early 1970s.\\"Requiem\\" (November 1999) Associated Musicians of Greater New York's Allegro.

They lived together in a house that they had built in Vienna, and Farmer reported contentment with his lifestyle; notably, in contrast with his homeland, he did not experience racism in Europe. Farmer described himself in 1985 as \\"an introvert, and kind of reclusive\\"; a soundproof room in his Austrian house allowed him to practice alone for the four or five hours a day that he desired. His personality was often described by others as mirroring his playing: Leonard Feather, for instance, observed in 1990 that Farmer was \\"mellow, relaxed and [...] gentle\\". Farmer was affected by the sudden death of his twin brother in 1963: more than 20 years later, he said that he still dreamed of his sibling, and admitted that, \\"It seems there's a part of him I haven't fully gotten over\\". Farmer's third wife died from cancer in 1992; speaking three years later, he remarked that \\"I guess I never will really recover from that because we had been together for over 20 years when she died\\". After his own death, he was described as being survived by his companion and manager, Lynne Mueller, and son.Ratliff, Ben (October 6, 1999) \\"Art Farmer, 71, Be-Bop Master of the Trumpet and Fluegelhorn\\". The New York Times. Playing style Descriptions of Farmer's playing style typically stress his lyricism and the warmth of his sound. The Los Angeles Times obituary writers noted that his playing had \\"a sweetly lyrical tone and a melodic approach to phrasing, neither of which minimized his capacity to produce rhythmically swinging phrases\\". The equivalent comments in The Guardian were that \\"Farmer avoided the bright, penetrating sound of orthodox trumpet playing and was influenced by the more reserved articulation of Miles Davis and Kenny Dorham\\", and that, although he could seem more restrained than Davis or Lee Morgan, \\"Farmer was in his way a true original. His phrasing was always distinctive, letting the beat run ahead of him rather in the manner of Billie Holiday's vocals\\". Farmer moved from trumpet to playing mostly flugelhorn from the early 1960s, utilising the latter instrument's more mellow sound and Farmer's ability to get what he wanted from it without having to use a mute. In 1989, he played a major part in creating a trumpet–flugelhorn hybrid, the flumpet, which was constructed for him by instrument maker David Monette. This instrument allowed him to play with more expression in a range of settings, from small groups to big bands. In 1997, Monette presented him with a personalized flumpet, with decorations symbolising important people and places in Farmer's life.Reich, Howard (August 5, 1997) \\"Specialized Instrument: Jazzman's 'Flumpet' Decorated with Personal Symbols\\". Chicago Tribune. Farmer's determination to keep exploring forms of expression continued throughout his life. One comment on a concert given when Farmer was 67 was that \\"his style was continuing to evolve\\"; he \\"delivered several solos in which his characteristically flowing lines were interrupted by sudden, wide melodic leaps and disjunct rhythmic accents\\". A few months before his death, although faster numbers had become perhaps too challenging, The Guardian observed, Farmer's playing on slower tunes achieved a new level of emotional expression.

Its history traces back to the foundation of Sheffield Medical School in 1828, Firth College in 1879 and Sheffield Technical School in 1884. University College of Sheffield was subsequently formed by the amalgamation of the three institutions in 1897 and was granted a royal charter as University of Sheffield in 1905 by King Edward VII. Sheffield is formed from 50 academic departments which are organised into five faculties and an international faculty. The annual income of the institution for 2018-19 was £677.2 million of which £154.8 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £657.9 million. Sheffield ranks among the top 10 of UK universities for research grant funding, and it has become number one in the UK for income and investment in engineering research according to new data published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). It is one of the top 7 British universities by postgraduate student enrollment along with UCL, King's, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Oxford. The university is one of the original red brick universities, a member of the Russell Group of research-intensive universities, the Worldwide Universities Network, the N8 Group of the eight most research intensive universities in Northern England and the White Rose University Consortium. Sheffield has been ranked as top 100 university in the world by QS for last fifteen years.https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-sheffield#wurs In 2019, the University ranked 22nd in Europe for teaching excellence. There are eight Nobel laureates affiliated with Sheffield and six of them are the alumni or former long-term staff of the university. They are contributors to the development of penicillin, the discovery of the citric acid cycle, the investigation of high-speed chemical reactions, the discovery of introns in eukaryotic DNA, the discovery of fullerene, and the development of molecular machines. Alumni also include several Head of state, Home Secretary, Court of Appeal judges, Booker Prize winner, astronaut and Olympic gold medallists. History Origins Former Master Cutler and Mayor of Sheffield Mark Firth opened Firth College in 1879 The University of Sheffield was originally formed by the merger of three local institutions: the Sheffield School of Medicine, Firth College, and the Sheffield Technical School. With a history dating back to as early as the 1810s, the Sheffield School of Medicine is the university’s oldest predecessor institution, which is also the oldest higher education establishment in Sheffield. In 1795, the General Infirmary was opened, becoming the first hospital in the city. Because of the apprenticeship-type training, the medical education at that time was largely unstructured. Regarded as the father of Sheffield's medical education, surgeon apothecary Hall Overend began to train medical students in 1811. His school of anatomy and medicine was externally recognised in 1828, and he conducted and taught human dissection in an anatomy museum at his home in Church Street. Overend, however, was not officially registered as a lecturer with the Society of Apothecaries, a recognised body for medical education. Physicians and surgeons of the General Infirmary suggested that a school associated with the hospital would be highly eligible for recognition by the Society. As a result, in 1828, a public meeting was called by physician Sir Arnold Knight, and supported by Overend, to establish a new medical school. The Sheffield Medical Institution was formally opened a year later in 1829 on Surrey Street, with the latin motto Ars longa vita brevis (Art is long, life is short), which refers to the difficulty to acquire and practice the art of Medicine. Knight laid the foundation stone and delivered the opening lecture. The University Extension Movement emerged in the 1870s with the aim of providing education in the city which lacked any tertiary institutions. During the period, the steel industry in Sheffield was prospering and the city's population was doubled to around 240,000 from the 1840s. In 1871, the university extension scheme arrived in Sheffield, and a group of lecturers from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge travelled to the city giving lectures and educating people about the benefits of tertiary education. Steel manufacturer and former Mayor of Sheffield Mark Firth and clergyman Samuel Earnshaw therefore organised courses in English literature and political economy. The courses became popular so Firth decided to donate £20,000 and purchase a site in the city centre (now Leopold Street and West Street) in 1877 to build a new institution for the classes. Firth College was founded during Firth's late year in 1879 and developed out of the Extension Movement scheme to teach arts and pure science subjects. The college saved the medical school, which had an insecure early history, from collapse and took over the teaching of all background subjects to medical students. In 1888 the medical school was relocated, opposite Firth College, to a new building on Leopold Street. Firth College also helped to fund the opening of the Sheffield Technical School in 1884 to teach applied science, the only major faculty the existing colleges did not cover. The Sheffield Technical School was created by collecting funds within Firth College because of local concern about the need for technical training, particularly steelmaking in Sheffield. Former Mayor of Sheffield Sir Frederick Mappin started to fundraise for the school and £10,240 was raised. A grant was secured in 1883 to fund a professor of Metallurgy and Mechanical Engineering. Many of the steel-making firms in Sheffield contributed to funding the Technical School, and research from the school in turn helped develop new processes and products for the companies. The Technical School was originally founded as a new technical department in Firth College, and in 1886, the school moved to St George's Square (later renamed Charlotte Street and now Mappin Street) on the site of the old Grammar School. William Ripper was appointed as Head of Mechanical Engineering at Firth College from 1889, then Principal of Sheffield Technical School. Foundation William Mitchinson Hicks was the founding Vice-Chancellor of the University College of Sheffield Sheffield was at that time the only large city in England without a university. William Mitchinson Hicks, who was Principal of Firth College from 1892 to 1897, had an ambition to establish a university in the city. As a first stage of his ideal, Hicks was devoted to the union of the three higher education institutions in Sheffield and to transform Firth College into a university college. He also extended the college by creating new departments and adding new buildings. In 1897, Firth College merged with the Medical School and the Technical School to form the University College of Sheffield, and Hicks served as its first Principal. Six years since the foundation of the university college, on 18 May 1903, the resolution to apply for a royal charter was passed. The university college started to develop its estate soon after: Western House by Weston Park on Western Bank was bought and demolished in 1903 for building a new university property. A building with a traditional collegiate quadrangle (later known as Western Bank building and now Firth Court) was planned on the site. Sir Frederick Mappin later successfully sought financial support from the Sheffield City Council and appealed for public donations. In 1904, steelworkers, coal miners, factory workers and the people of Sheffield donated over £50,000 via penny donations to help found the University of Sheffield. The poster which helped raise funds for the university (1904-1905) It was originally envisaged that the university college would join Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds as the fourth member of the federal Victoria University. The new university was proposed to be named \\"Victoria University of Yorkshire\\" by Leeds but was rejected by the Privy Council. The Victoria University, however, began to split up as independent universities before this could happen, when Liverpool gained a charter of its own in 1903. Rather than joining a Yorkshire university with Leeds, the University College of Sheffield was driven by civic pride to pursue independent university status, to bring higher education, give support to industries and serve as a centre for disease study. Hicks also advocated the independent degree awarding power would attract talented staff. The University College of Sheffield's charter was sealed on 31 May 1905 and became the University of Sheffield. On 12 July 1905, Firth Court on Western Bank was opened by King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. St George's Square remained the centre of departments of Applied Science, and the departments of Arts, Medicine and Science moved to Western Bank. Sheffield is one of the six pre-World War One red brick universities, the civic universities founded in the major industrial cities of England. 20th century Firth Court, opened in 1905, is the main administrative centre for the university In 1905, when the university first opened, there were 363 students and 114 of them were enrolled full-time. Sheffield at the time had 71 members of staff. By then, the first Hall of Residence (Stephenson Hall) and library (Edgar Allen library) had been established. The number of students increased to a short-lived peak of 1,000 in 1919 when returning ex-servicemen were admitted to the university. During the First World War, some of the academic subjects and courses were replaced by teaching of munitions making and medical appliances production. The university has expanded since the 1920s from two ends on Western Bank and on the St George's site. The number of full time students was stabilized at about 750 between the two world wars. In 1943, the University Grants Committee announced that universities in the UK should look forward to expansion in the years after the Second World War. Sheffield predicted a 50% increase in student population but the university was unprepared for such growth. There was pressure on the university to expand since the student numbers had increased from around 1,000 to 3,000 by 1946. The university announced proposals for development in 1947, which emphasised the need for new departments, medical school, library, administration building, halls of residence, as well as the completion of the Western Bank quadrangle and the extension of the Students' Union. The university then grew slowly until the 1950s and 1960s when it began to expand rapidly. Many new buildings (including the Main Library and the Arts Tower) were built and older houses were brought into academic use. Student numbers increased to their present levels of just under 26,000. At the same time in the 1950s, the university was expanding at other sites, including the St Georges area. From the 1960s, many more buildings have been constructed or extended, including the Union of Students and St George's Library. The campus master plan proposed in the 1940s was completed by the 1970s, and the university required a new development plan. The 1980s saw the opening of many new buildings and centres, such as the multi-purpose Octagon Centre and the Sir Henry Stephenson Building. The university's teaching hospital, Northern General Hospital, was also extended. In 1987 the university began to collaborate with its once would-be partners of the Victoria University by co-founding the Northern Consortium; a coalition for the education and recruitment of international students. The university continued to expand in the 1990s. New premises were opened for School of the Clinical Dentistry, the Division of Education, and the Management School. In 1995, the university took over the Sheffield and North Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery, forming a new School of Nursing and Midwifery. The St George's Hospital was extended and a new building at the Northern General Hospital has been constructed, which greatly increased the size of the medical faculty. Hans Adolf Krebs was appointed as Lecturer in Pharmacology in 1935. At Sheffield Krebs and his postgraduate student discovered the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle) in 1937, which earned him a Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology for 1953. In 1938, the university opened the Department of Biochemistry (renamed since the 1990s as the Department of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology) and Krebs became its first Head. Krebs Institute, a research centre for mechanistic biology, was founded in 1988 within the Department of Biochemistry. George Porter joined the university as Professor of Physical Chemistry in 1955 and he further developed his later Nobel Prize-winning work flash photolysis at Sheffield. Porter was appointed Firth Professor of Chemistry and became Head of the Department of Chemistry in 1963. 21st century In the 21st century, the university opened many more major buildings in the area immediately to the east and west of Upper Hanover Street, such as the Jessop Building, the Soundhouse, Jessop West and the Information Commons. The Arts Tower building, the Students' Union and University House buildings, the Sheffield Bioincubator and University Health Centre were also refurbished. A new campus, North Campus, was opened. In 2003, a development framework was produced by Turnberry Consulting, with proposals aimed to densify the campus. In 2005, the South Yorkshire Strategic Health Authority announced that it would split the training between Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University – however, the university decided to pull out of providing preregistration nursing and midwifery training due to \\"costs and operational difficulties\\". On 28 September 2015, a new six-storey building, the Diamond, was opened. In February 2016, the university started to work with Sheffield City Council to transform public spaces around the campus. The £8 million project includes building and improving pedestrianisation, crossings, cycle routes, as well as greening the campus. The University Concourse was refurbished in 2019 to replace the 50-year-old paving and walls. Major development projects in the 2020s include constructions of a new Information School building (Northumberland Road Building), Social Sciences Building, Royce Discovery Centre, energy centre (the Transformer), Translational Energy Research Centre, and redevelopment of the original Henderson's factory. Campus and locations The Arts Tower and Western Bank Library The University of Sheffield is not a campus university, though most of it's 430 buildings are located in fairly close proximity to each other. It is divided geographically by the Sheffield Inner Ring Road. The Upper Hanover Street section of the ring road splits university buildings into the Western Bank and the St George’s campus areas. Instead of growing from a single centre, since receiving its Royal Charter, the university has expanded from two academic foci about 1 km apart: Firth Court on Western Bank and Sir Frederick Mappin Building on St George’s. The two foci started to fuse in the 1960s, as more buildings have been constructed or acquired by the university. The completion of the Information Commons and Jessop West buildings, in the late 2000s, bridges both west (Western Bank) and east (St George’s) campus, and in 2017, a new pedestrian crossing was installed on the Upper Hanover Street, physically connecting the two campus. The university campus is composed of an eclectic range of buildings from Victorian style to modernism to contemporary. Sir Frederick Mappin Building and Central Block are two Victorian university buildings, now linked by a contemporary curved glass roof constructed in 2020. Opened as the Western Bank Building, Firth Court is a red brick Edwardian building in Perpendicular Revival style, and is connected to the 1971 modernist Alfred Denny Building. The nearby Arts Tower is also an example of postwar modernist building in the International Style. The Diamond, a contemporary architecture designed by Twelve Architects, is situated next to the Victorian Jessop Building on the former site of Jessop's Edwardian wing. A total of 36 university estate are listed. Of these, the Arts Tower and Western Bank Library are Grade II* listed buildings. Firth Court, Mappin Building, St George’s Church, Jessop Building and the Drama Studio are listed Grade II. Main (Western Bank) Campus The centre of the university's presence lies one mile to the west of Sheffield city centre, where there is a mile-long collection of buildings belonging almost entirely to the university. This main campus area is bounded by Upper Hanover Street to the east, Glossop Road to the south, Clarkson Street to the west, and Bolsover Street to the north. Western Bank (A57) runs through the campus. The area to the north of Western Bank includes Firth Court, Alfred Denny Building, Western Bank Library and Arts Tower, Geography and Planning building, Bartolomé House, and Dainton and Richard Roberts Buildings. Within the southern area of the campus are the Sheffield Students' Union, the Octagon Centre, Graves Building and Hicks Building. A concourse under the A57 flyover connects Alfred Denny Building on the north side and Students' Union on the south. Until the completion of three pedestrian crossings on Western Bank in 2017, the concourse underpass was the only link that allowed students to easily move between buildings in this cluster. The Information Commons, a library and computing centre opened in 2007, is also located at the Western Bank Campus on Leavygreave Road. In addition, throughout 2010 the Western Bank Library received a £3.3 million restoration and refurbishment, the University of Sheffield Union of Students underwent a £5 million rebuild, and work commenced on a multimillion-pound refurbishment of the Grade II* listed Arts Tower to extend its lifespan by 30 years. St George's Campus To the east of the main campus lies St George's campus, named after St George's Church (now a lecture theatre and postgraduate residence). The campus is the historical location of the Sheffield Technical School. It is bounded by Upper Hanover Street to the west, Broad Lane to the north, Rockingham Street to the east, and West Street to the south, and is part of St George's Quarter, one of the seven official Sheffield city centre quarters.Sheffield City Council Quarters plan Also known as the Engineering campus, St George's campus is centred on Mappin Street, the location of the Faculty of Engineering (partly housed in the Grade II-listed Mappin Building) and the Department of Journalism Studies, Department of Economics and Department of Computer Science. The university also maintains the Turner Museum of Glass in this area. As part of the 2000s development plan, the university has converted the listed Victorian Jessop Hospital for Women into the new home of the Department of Music in 2009. The formerly Grade II-listed Edwardian wing of the Jessop Hospital was demolished after Sheffield City Council’s planning committee voted for approval. The building was replaced by a new £81 million building for the Faculty of Engineering which opened in September 2015, named the Diamond. It is a purpose-built multi- disciplinary building that houses lecture theatres, laboratories, workrooms and other facilities for the teaching of engineering. Amongst the more recent additions to the university's estate located on this campus are the Soundhouse (2008; a music practice and studio facility) and the Jessop West building (2009; the first UK project by Berlin architects Sauerbruch Hutton). The Sir Frederick Mappin Building is a Grade II-listed building in an area known as the St George's Complex. The building houses much of the Faculty of Engineering and St George's IT centre. Completed in 1885, the oldest part of the building, the former Sheffield Technical School, now the Central Wing, lies in the centre of the building. The extensive Mappin Street frontage includes the main entrance, the John Carr Library and Mappin Hall, and is connected to the Central Wing by a bridge. In early 2020, the Mappin Building and the Central Wing were refurbished. As a result of the refurbishments, the two buildings are joint by an award-winning quadruple-height atrium with curved glass roof. The atrium, called the Engineering Heartspace, houses laboratories, offices and social spaces. St George's Church, now a lecture theatre and student accommodation Given its name to the campus, St George's Church was the first of three commissioners' churches to be built in Sheffield under the Church Building Act 1818. It was built in the Perpendicular style. The church closed in 1981 and was acquired by the university. It was converted for use as a lecture theatre in 1994,Harman, R. & Minnis, J. (2004) Pevsner City Guides: Sheffield, p88. New Haven & London: Yale University Press. while the upstairs has been converted for use as student accommodation. Other sites Further west lies Weston Park, the Weston Park Museum, the Harold Cantor Gallery, university's sports facilities Goodwin Sports Centre in the Crookesmoor area, and the Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health around the Royal Hallamshire Hospital (although these subjects are taught in the city's extensive teaching hospitals under the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, and throughout South Yorkshire and North East Lincolnshire). It is in this area that the new £12 million Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN), opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in November 2010, is located. There is a cluster of buildings located to the north of Broad Lane, opposite St George’s campus, collectively called the north campus. Kroto Research Institute, Kroto Innovation Centre, Nanoscience and Technology Building, Graduate Research Centre, George Porter Building and the International College are based on this campus area. To the south of the city on Warminster Road are where the sports pitches at Norton Sports Park located. The university also operates the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre on the border of Sheffield and Rotherham. The Conference Centre and Teaching Hall at Philadelphia Campus of St. Thomas' Church are used as exam venues by the university. Former locations The old Firth College building was built in 1879 at the corner of Leopold Street and West Street. It was designed by Thomas James Flockton and Edward Robert Robson with the front facing West Street. Firth College moved out of the building following the establishment of the university. The building later housed the Sheffield Central Technical School and is currently home to Education Committee offices of Sheffield City Council. Situated on 7 Leopold Street opposite Firth College, the old Medical School building was designed by John Dodsley Webster and completed in 1888. The school moved to Firth Court in 1905 and the building is now used as offices. The Manvers campus, at Wath-on-Dearne between Rotherham and Barnsley, was where the majority of nursing was taught. A three- storey building, Humphry Davy House (named after chemist Humphry Davy), was built in 1998 on Golden Smithies Lane opposite to Dearne Valley College. The building was home to the School of Nursing and Midwifery, which was established in 1995 after the merger of the university with Sheffield and North Trent College of Nursing and Midwifery. In 2004, the university disagreed with the South Yorkshire Strategic Health Authority's decision to take away part of its nursing and midwifery training contract, and declined the offer due to financial and operational constraints. The last intake of midwifery studies students was in July 2006, and the campus was closed one year later. The building was sold in 2018 and to be converted for residential lettings. Organisation Faculties and departments Sheffield had four faculties in 1905, which were Arts, Pure Science, Medicine and Applied Science. The Faculty of Applied Science later split into Engineering and Metallurgy in 1919. As well as educating full-time students, in the early 20th century, the university taught non-degree courses that covered non- conventional, occupation-focused subjects such as cow-keeping, railway economics, mining and razor-grinding. The university has currently five faculties comprising 50 departments and 82 research centres and institutes, plus an international faculty. The current faculty structure is: * Faculty of Arts and Humanities ** Archaeology ** School of English ** East Asian Studies ** School of Languages and Cultures ** History ** Modern Languages Teaching Centre ** Music ** Philosophy ** Sheffield Institute for Interdisciplinary Biblical Studies * Faculty of Engineering ** Aerospace Engineering ** Automatic Control and Systems Engineering ** Bioengineering ** Chemical and Biological Engineering ** Civil and Structural Engineering ** Computer Science ** Electronic and Electrical Engineering ** Material Science and Engineering ** Mechanical Engineering * Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health ** Infection, Immunity and Cardiovascular Medicine ** School of Dentistry ** Medical School ** Neuroscience ** Health Sciences School ** Oncology and Metabolism ** School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) * Faculty of Science ** Animal and Plant Science ** School of Mathematics and Statistics ** Biomedical Science ** Chemistry ** Molecular Biology and Biotechnology ** Physics and Astronomy ** Psychology * Faculty of Social Sciences ** Architecture ** Economics ** Education ** Geography ** The Information School ** Journalism ** Landscape Architecture ** Law ** Management School ** Politics and International Relations ** Sheffield Methods Institute ** Sociology ** Urban Studies and Planning * International Faculty – CITY College ** Business Administration & Economics ** Computer Science ** Psychology ** Humanities and Social Sciences ** Executive MBA Faculty of Arts and Humanities The Faculty of Arts and Humanities is made up of eight schools and departments. It is also home to three institutes (Humanities Research Institute, Sheffield Institute for Interdisciplinary Biblical Studies, and Digital Humanities Institute) and 16 research centres. The Centre for Research into Freemasonry and Fraternalism of the faculty was the first centre devoted to scholarly research into Freemasonry in a UK university. The centre was closed in 2010, ten years after its establishment, due to its failure to capture substantial grants to support the centre's activities. Faculty of Engineering The precursor to the Faculty of Engineering is the Sheffield Technical School established in the 1880s, which offered part-time and evening class programme to adults working in the steel industry. During 1917, departments of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Civil and Structural Engineering and Mechanical Engineering were founded in response to the needs of the First World War. The departments provided training courses for injured and incapacitated soldiers, and manufactured inspection gauges and munition shells. The Faculty of Engineering has now over 6,700 students and 1,000 staff. Over 90% of the research from the department was rated as 4* (world- leading) or 3* (internationally excellent). Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health The Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health is made up of four schools, including the Medical School, Health Sciences School, School of Clinical Dentistry and School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR). The Medical School is the oldest school of the university. It operated independently as the Sheffield School of Medicine until its mergers with Firth College and with Sheffield Technical School. The Medical School is located next to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, one of the Sheffield's teaching hospitals, and the school is associated with Sheffield Children's Hospital, Northern General Hospital, Weston Park Hospital and Charles Clifford Dental Hospital. It is one of 32 bodies entitled to award medical degrees in the United Kingdom by the General Medical Council (GMC), the body responsible for registering doctors to practise medicine as well as regulating medical education and training in the United Kingdom. Faculty of Science The Faculty of Science is comprised of seven classical science departments: Animal and Plant Sciences, Biomedical Science, Chemistry, Mathematics and Statistics, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Physics and Astronomy, and Psychology. All of the university's six Nobel Laureates have been affiliated with this faculty. The Department of Animal and Plant Sciences is one of the largest departments dedicated for whole-organism biology studies in the UK. Biology has been taught in Sheffield since 1884 in Firth College. Appointed the first Professor of Biology in 1888, Alfred Denny was the only biologist in the Department of Biology at the college who taught zoology and botany to science and medical students. In 1896, a second biologist, botanist Bertram H. Bentley, joined the college. Soon after the university was founded, in 1908, two separate departments were established: Zoology (head by Denny) and Botany (head by Bentley). The departments were not merged until the establishment of the Department of Animal and Plant Sciences in 1988, as part of a major rationalisation at the university. David H. Lewis, who was Head of Botany, was the first Head of Animal and Plant Sciences. The department was awarded a maximum score of 24 points in the QAA Teaching Quality Assessment in 1999, and top five for biological sciences research in the REF 2014. Faculty of Social Sciences The Sheffield School of Architecture is one of the longest established architecture schools in the UK, opening in 1908, and was located in the tower of Firth Court. It was soon moved to the Sunday School in Shearwood Road and is located on the top 6 floors of the Arts Tower since 1965. The School has courses accredited by the Architects Registration Board (ARB) and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), and has an active student society (SUAS). In the Research Excellence Framework (REF) 2014, Sheffield School of Architecture ranked 4th in the UK. Established in 1986, the Management School is an AMBA, AACSB and EQUIS accredited business school. It is one of 60 business schools in the world to have achieved triple accreditation. In 2013 the school moved into newly refurbished facilities close to the University of Sheffield campus and Broomhill. It now has dedicated learning and teaching space, a courtyard, dedicated café and Employability Hub. The Information School (iSchool) is a constituent school of the Faculty of Social Sciences. It was founded as Postgraduate School of Librarianship in 1963 and became the Department of Information Studies in 1981. In 2010, the Information School devoting to the study of the information field was established. The current head of school is Professor Peter Bath. The school is ranked second in the world and first in Europe for Library and Information Studies in the QS World University Rankings 2020. International Faculty The university has an international faculty called CITY College in Thessaloniki, the second largest city of Greece, which is the only faculty operating out of the UK. The faculty was established in 1989 in order to bridge the UK with the Southeast and Eastern Europe. It is a private legal entity operating as CITY College according to the local law in Greece. The International Faculty consists of four departments, namely Business Administration and Economics, Psychology, Computer Science and English Studies. These departments are housed in the L. Sofou Building and the Strategakis Building, two buildings in close proximity in Thessaloniki city centre. The faculty also operates the South East European Research Centre (SEERC), a multidisciplinary research centre established in 2003. Governance There are several bodies which govern the university, including the Council, the Senate and the Faculties. The Council is the governing body of the university, which is responsible for the strategic development, legal and regulatory affairs, and performance of university business (finance and property). Council membership comprises a majority of non-executive lay members appointed under the statutes of the university. The Chair and Pro-Chancellor of the Council is currently Tony Pedder. The Senate manages the academic side of the university. It is the highest academic authority of the university, and is also responsible for the regulation of research work and students' discipline. The Senate is chaired by the Vice- Chancellor, with its membership drawn mainly from the university's academic staff. The five Faculties regulates departmental teaching, research, examination, and also admission. They are responsible for making recommendations to the Senate on the award of degrees, fellowships, and academic staff appointments and promotions. The university central committees also include the University Executive Board, whose members are: President and Vice-Chancellor (or simply Vice-Chancellor), Provost and Deputy Vice Chancellor, Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Executive Director of Corporate Services, Executive Director of Academic Services, five Faculty Vice- Presidents, three Cross-Cutting Vice-Presidents (Education, Innovation and Research), and University Secretary. The board provides leadership and management, as well as advises the Vice-Chancellor on operational matters. The Vice-Chancellor is the Chief Executive and Accountable Officer of the university. The current Vice-Chancellor is Koen Lamberts, and the Provost and Deputy Vice Chancellor is Gill Valentine. The Court of the university is no longer a university committee. The Court was a large body which fosters relations between the university and the community, and included lay members, many of whom are University alumni. Ex-officio members of the Court included all the MPs of Sheffield, the Bishops of Sheffield and Hallam, and the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police. It also included representatives of professional bodies such as the Arts Council, Royal Society and the General Medical Council. Court met annually to receive reports from the Council, the Senate and the Students' Union. It served many official functions including Chancellor election.

Its endowment was £46.0 million. Coat of arms The University Coat of Arms, displayed on the front of Mappin Building The arms of the university was granted by the College of Arms on 28 June 1905. It is on an azure shield with a gold-edged book inscribed with the Latin Disce Doce (Learn and Teach) at its centre, a sheaf of eight silver arrows on either side (from the arms of the city), the Crown of Success and the White Rose of York. Below is a scroll carrying the motto Rerum cognoscere causas (To Discover the Causes of Things; from the Georgics by Latin poet Virgil), which was also the motto of Firth College since 1879. In heraldic terminology, the official coat of arms is blazoned as follows: > Azure, an open book proper, edged gold, inscribed with the words Disce Doce > between in fess two sheaves of eight arrows interlaced saltireways and > banded argent, in chief an open crown or, and in base a rose also argent > barbed and seeded proper. The current university's logo, consists of a redrawn version of the coat of arms and the name of the institution, is introduced in 2005, the centenary year of the university. However, the logo should not supersede and be confused with the coat of arms, which remains the official heraldic symbol of the university. Branding The brand (encompassing the visual identity) is centred on the theme of \\"discovery\\", led by the university's motto. It has been applied across print, screen and other areas such as signage, vehicle livery and merchandising. The project was key to the university's Marketing Department receiving \\"HEIST Marketing Team of the Year, 2005\\". The university's fonts are TUOS Stephenson (serif) and TUOS Blake (sans-serif). Both TUOS Stephenson and TUOS Blake are modified versions of a typeface designed by Sheffield company Stephenson & Blake Co. The two fonts are the copyright property of the University of Sheffield and are restricted only to university users. Ceremony Academic dress Australian medic Ian D. Cooke (right) wearing a doctoral gown at graduation ceremony As at most universities, Sheffield graduands wear academic dress appropriate to the degree they are to be received when graduating. Bachelors wear a black Oxford BA [b1] gown (see Groves classification system). The hood is in green, half- lined with white fur, and edged with two inches of silk of the colour distinctive of the degree or the faculty. Masters wear a black Oxford MA [m1] gown with a hood of green silk which is lined throughout with the faculty colour. The MPhil hood is lined in green. Doctors have a fine scarlet cloth gown with green silk, with bell-shaped sleeves [d2]. The hood is of the Cambridge shape [f1] and is made of red ottoman silk. In 1993, the postgraduate diplomate hood is entered in the Calendar of the University of Sheffield. It is a blend of Bachelors’ and Masters’ hoods, with a hood of green silk and a neckband of the faculty colour. The faculty and degree colours are: Arts and Humanities—crushed strawberry; Music—cream brocade; Engineering—purple; Medicine and Surgery—red; Dental Surgery—pale rose pink; Health—cerise; Science—apricot; Social Sciences—lemon yellow; International Faculty—Saxon blue; Board of Extra Faculty Provision—pale blue. Some schools at Sheffield had previously their own colours but are no longer used. They were: Metallurgy—steel grey; Education—pearl; Architecture—old gold; Law—olive green. The old colour of the Faculty of Social Sciences was pale green. University mace The university mace is an ornament of governance of the University of Sheffield. It is silver-gilt and carries the coats of arms of both the university and the city of Sheffield, and the White Rose of York. A figure of Minerva holding a wreath and palm branch on a heraldic crown adorns the top of the mace. Used for the first time in 1909, the mace is carried in academic procession as the symbol of authority, which precedes the presiding officer. Academics Reputation and rankings The university has been described by The Times as one of the powerhouses of British higher education. The university is a member of the Russell Group, the European University Association, the Worldwide Universities Network and the White Rose University Consortium. Meanwhile, it was among the top 10 of the Russell Group for research output and top 12 for research strength in Research Excellence Framework 2014. In terms of research citations, Sheffield was ranked 93rd worldwide and 9th in the UK by the CWUR 2018-19. It was also ranked 20th overall in Europe and 10th in the UK for number of signed EU grant agreements according to the data since 2007. Sheffield has received the Queen's Anniversary Prize four times in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2007.University website Queen's Anniversary Prizes In 2011 it was named 'University of the Year' in the Times Higher Education awards. The latest Times Higher Education Student Experience Survey 2014 ranked the University of Sheffield 1st for student experience, social life, university facilities and accommodation, among other categories. It was also named as one of the top 50 most international universities in 2018 around the world and its reputation of outstanding teaching has been underlined in the most recent league table which put Sheffield joint 9th in the UK and 11th across Europe. In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework (REF) Sheffield was ranked 12th for research power and 14th by GPA for research quality in the UK, with 86% (8th highest among the Russell Group) of the research submitted by the academic staff having been rigorously judged as world leading (4*) or internationally excellent (3*). The university was one of only eleven in the country to make 30 or more submissions in a wide range of subject areas. Of the 35 submissions from Sheffield, 23 were judged to be in the top ten in the Russell Group for the quality of their research outputs.

In terms of average UCAS points of entrants, Sheffield ranked 29th in Britain in 2014. The university gives offers of admission to 85.6% of its applicants, the 4th highest amongst the Russell Group. According to the 2017 Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide, approximately 13% of Sheffield's undergraduates come from independent schools. In the 2016-17 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 71:5:24 of UK:EU:non-EU students respectively with a female to male ratio of 51:49. Libraries The Information Commons The University of Sheffield has currently four libraries: Western Bank Library, the Information Commons, Health Sciences Library (Royal Hallamshire Hospital and Northern General Hospital), and The Diamond, holding a total of 1.5 million printed books. Western Bank Library was the university's main library until the opening of the Information Commons in 2007. The Grade II* listed library has 730 study spaces and contains 1.2 million texts for most subjects, as well as archives and special collections. The Information Commons (IC) is a 24/7 learning centre combining both library and IT services, which was the first of its kind in the UK. The IC houses 120,000 core textbooks for all undergraduate and postgraduate subjects, and has approximately 1,300 study spaces and 550 PCs. The university has two medical libraries collectively called the Health Sciences Library. It was opened at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in 1978, and a year later a branch at the Northern General Hospital was opened. The Royal Hallamshire Hospital library has collections cover medicine, dentistry, nursing and midwifery, and the Northern General Hospital library contains material for medicine and nursing. Opened its door in 2018, the Diamond provides 24-hour library services (and other teaching facilities), with in- demand textbooks, a non-loanable reference collection and over 1,000 study spaces. It replaces the 1992 St George’s Library on St George’s Campus as the main engineering library and study space. The University of Sheffield Library is a member of Research Libraries UK. Former libraries include Edgar Allen Library closed by the late 1950s and St George’s Library closed on 14th June 2015. Edgar Allen Library was the first university library. In 1905 when the university was established, the library was housed in a lecture room due to lack of funds to construct a purpose-built library. William Edgar Allen, a member of the University Council, provided £10,000 to build a proper library named Edgar Allen Library, locating beside the main university building (Firth Court). Edgar Allen Library had 100 seats in its reading room, shelves for 20,000 books, and a stack space for 60,000 more books. Sir Charles Harding Firth, the first lecturer in Modern History in Firth College, donated part of his personal collection to the library. Sheffield Town Trustee also helped the university to transform the General Lecture Theatre into a reading room housing the Firth Collection (rare book collection of approximately 20,000 volumes) in 1931. As the university rapidly expanded in the 1950s, it became necessary to replace Edgar Allen Library with a modern post-war era library. The library, later known as the Western Bank Library, was opened on 12th May 1959. Edgar Allen Library (now the Rotunda in Firth Court) became the Registrar and Secretary's Office. St George’s Library (now 38 Mappin Street) was refurbished as an exam venue. Museums and collections Henry Clifton Sorby donated his lantern glass slide collection to the university library The Alfred Denny Museum is a zoology museum operated by the university. Established in 1905, the museum was located in Firth Court, spanning three floors, and was named after the first professor of biology at Sheffield in 1950. It has specimens from all major phyla, and two letters written from Charles Darwin to Henry Denny, father of Alfred Denny. Many of the specimens have been collected since the 1900s, but much of the information about the collection was lost during the Second World War. The museum, now reduced in size, has been moved to Alfred Denny Building after the war. The museum is not open to the public at all time but usually on the first Saturday of each month. The Turner Museum of Glass houses the university's collections of 19th and 20th century glass. It contains items mainly from major European and American glassworkers and examples from ancient Egypt and Rome. It is in the Hadfield Building. It was founded by W. E. S. Turner of the university in 1943. One of the exhibits is the wedding dress of Helen Nairn (Turner's wife) which is made of glass fibre. This has been selected as one of the items in the BBC's A History of the World in 100 Objects. BBC A History of the World Glass Fibre Wedding Dress The Traditional Heritage Museum (THM) was opened to the public in 1985 as part of the National Centre for English Cultural Tradition. It was created (and curated) by Prof John Widdowson in 1964 and was entirely run by volunteers and students. The THM housed collections including a replica kitchen from the 1920s, reconstructed workshops and retail shops, such as Pollard's tea and coffee. The university decided to close the Museum in 2011 because the building could not afford continued public access. In 2013, the collections from the Traditional Heritage Museum were relocated and are accessible again to the public. The majority of the items was transferred to not-for-profit organisation Green Estate (operators of the Sheffield Manor Lodge). Other major recipients include Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust, Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust and Ken Hawley Trust. The Western Bank Library has an Exhibition Gallery. It is located on the mezzanine level of the library, enabling special collections from the university library and the National Fairground Archive to be displayed in controlled conditions. In 2010, the gallery was restored and refurbished by a grant from the Wolfson Foundation. The library usually schedules three temporary exhibitions per year, and most of the exhibitions are free to visit during library opening hours. The Henry Clifton Sorby Collection contains glass lantern slides of marine organisms prepared and donated by Henry Clifton Sorby in the 1900s. Sorby was president of Firth College after the death of Mark Firth, vice- president of the University College of Sheffield, and a member of the Council of the University of Sheffield. His broad interests included marine biology, and he had developed a technique for preparing and mounting invertebrate marine animals onto slides. The specimens were cleared and stained so that enabling projection onto a screen for viewing. The glass lantern slides are now held in the Department Animal and Plant Sciences. The Sheffield Herbarium is also operated by the Department Animal and Plant Sciences, with a collectionof preserved plant specimens collected in the late 19th century and early to mid 20th century. The collection is mainly from the British Isles and Europe focusing on tracheophytes, bryophytes, charophytes and fungi. Many of the micro-fungi specimens are from the collection of mycologist and Sheffield alumnus John Webster. The National Fairground and Circus Archive (NFCA) is a living archive that collects material from the fairground, circus and the allied entertainment industries. NFCA was in 1994 developed out of the PhD research by Vanessa Toulmin, who was later director of the archive from its inception until 2016. With its own Reading Room situated in Western Bank Library, the archive holds 150,000 photographs, 4,000 books and journals, together with over 20,000 items of printed and video ephemera. Major collections include the Shufflebottom Family Collection, the John Bramwell Taylor Collection, the Malcolm Airey Collection and the John Turner Collection. Flagship institutes Sheffield has four flagship research institutes that aim to turn interdisciplinary and translational research into practical solutions. Launched in 2019, the institutes focus on clean energy generation, sustainable food, health improvement and quality of life. The Energy Institute is one of the largest energy research centres in Europe. It has over 300 researchers working on energy-related problems, including improving energy efficiency and developing ways to achieve clean growth. The Neuroscience Institute works to advance fundamental neuroscience and harnesses new discoveries to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. This includes the exploration of artificial intelligence applications in healthcare for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease and improving prognosis. The Healthy Lifespan Institute brings together 120 researchers from a wide range of disciplines with the aim of tackling the global epidemic of multimorbidity and slowing down the ageing process. The Institute for Sustainable Food is committed to finding solutions on food security and environmental sustainability. Academic and industrial partners The University of Sheffield's major research partners and clients include Boeing, Rolls Royce, Siemens, Unilever, Boots, AstraZeneca, GSK, ICI, and Slazenger, as well as UK and overseas government agencies and charitable foundations. Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre is a network of centres and a partnership between the university and over a hundred industrial companies on the Advanced Manufacturing Park. The university also works with local small and medium enterprises through the dedicated physical spaces at the Sheffield Bioincubator and Kroto Innovation Centre. For many years the university has been engaged in theological publishing through Sheffield Academic Press and JSOT Press. The university is also a partner organisation in Higher Futures, a collaborative association of institutions set up under the government's Lifelong Learning Networks initiative, to co-ordinate vocational and work-based education. As well as the research carried out in departments, the university has over 180 specialised research centres or institutes. The last Teaching Quality Assessment awarded Sheffield University grades of \\"excellent\\" in 29 subject areas, a record equalled by only a few other UK universities. The University of Sheffield has around 250 student exchange partners in nearly 40 countries world-wide including exchange programs with Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of Texas at Austin, National University of Singapore, University of Munich and University of Melbourne. Involvement with the arms trade Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre is run in partnership with Boeing, which conducts research projects funded by arms manufacturers such as BAE Systems. In 2008, the university partnered with BAE Systems to launch a new Centre for Research in Active Control which aimed to improve the stealth of BAE Systems' submarines. In 2012 the Students Union voted in favour of the university ending all links with the arms trade. Student life Students' Union Students' Union The University of Sheffield Students' Union was founded in 1906 and has nearly 300 student societies and nearly 50 sports teams. The Students' Union has been voted best in the UK for ten consecutive years, from 2009 to 2018, by the Times Higher Education Student Experience Survey. Sheffield University Football Club has been established for many decades and has previously competed in the FA Amateur Cup and FA Vase. The Union building contains society and union workplaces and coffee shops, restaurants, shops, and the student run cinema Film Unit. Facilities include two bars (Bar One – which has a book-able function room with its own bar, The Raynor Lounge – and The Interval); a three-room club venue (Foundry); There is also a student radio station called Forge Radio, a TV station called Forge TV, and a newspaper called Forge Press, which are run under the umbrella of Forge Media since 2008. In November 2009 a development project began to redevelop the Students' Union building, funded by £5 million by the HEFCE, which was completed and re-opened in September 2010. Works centred on improving circulation around the building by aligning previously disjointed floors, improving internal access between the Union building and neighbouring University House, and constructing a new entrance and lobby that incorporates the university's traditional colours of black and gold. During 2012–13 the Students' Union went under a further redevelopment costing £20 million which led to the refurbishment of the University House. University House, completed in 1963, has been integrated with the university's Students' Union in one single building. Student accommodation Broad Lane Court, a student accommodation in the city centre The university halls of residence comprises two separate sites: Ranmoor/Endcliffe and City. Ranmoor/Endcliffe is situated in the western suburb of Sheffield, which is close to Broomhill and Ecclesall Road. The Endcliffe Village was opened in 2008 and the Ranmoor Village in 2009. Ranmoor House, opened in the autumn term of 1968, was once the largest hall of residence at the university, housing around 800 students. As part of the university's Student Residences Strategy, Ranmoor House was demolition in March 2008, a year before the new Ranmoor Village was scheduled to open. The Endcliffe and Ranmoor villages have been together referred to as Ranmoor/Endcliffe since 2016. The Endcliffe Village was renamed \\"South accommodation (near Endcliffe)\\", and the Ranmoor Village \\"North accommodation (near Ranmoor)\\". City accommodation, including Allen Court, Broad Lane Court, St. George's Flats, Mappin Court and Studio 300, are located on the Main Campus, on St George's Campus, or near the North Campus. Off campus can be found Sheffield Student Housing Co-operative, a student housing cooperative providing not-for-profit, student-managed housing for its members. They currently manage a property on Northfield Road in Crookes, Sheffield. Sheffield Varsity The annual Sheffield Varsity is an annual varsity match that takes place between sports teams from the university and its rival Sheffield Hallam University starting from 1996. The varsity is divided into winter and summer competitions. Over 1,000 students from both universities compete in over 30 varsity sports in more than 70 events. The university's sports colours are black and gold. Sheffield won the Varsity competition in 2013, beating Hallam for the first time in ten years. It extended the new found winning streak to seven years in a row; winning again from 2014 to 2019. People associated with the university Notable alumni Many notable people in a number of disciplines have attended Sheffield. A number of politicians are alumni of the university, including President of Dominica Nicholas Liverpool, Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey Nurettin Canikli, Home Secretary David Blunkett, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Seychelles Jean-Paul Adam, Downing Street Chief of Staff Nick Timothy.

Location The station is located under Rue de Turbigo at its exit on Rue du Temple, nearby Place Élisabeth-Dmitrieff. Oriented along a northeast–southwest axis, it is located between the Arts et Métiers and République stations, the latter being geographically very close to it. History It opened on 19 October 1904 as part of the first section of the line opened between Père Lachaise and Villiers. It is named after the Temple, a long-demolished Templar fortification that once stood in the square named after it. It is the only Paris Metro station to share its name with a station on the London Underground. As part of the RATP's Renouveau du métro program, the entire station was renovated by 29 October 2003. In 2018, 1,258,217 travelers entered this station which places it at 209th position of the metro stations for its usage out of 302. Passenger services Access The station has a single entrance entitled Place Élisabeth- Dmitrieff, leading to said square formed by the corner of Rue du Temple and Rue de Turbigo (named in honor of Elisabeth Dmitrieff on 8 March 2007, International Women's Day). Consisting of a fixed staircase, it is adorned with a Guimard entrance, which is the subject of registration as a historic monuments by a decree of 29 May 1978. Between the entry and the access corridors to the platform, a mosaic by the French artist Hervé Mathieu- Bachelot has been installed since 1982: Couleur en masses.

There is often accompanying eye watering, nasal congestion, or swelling around the eye on the affected side. These symptoms typically last 15 minutes to 3 hours. Attacks often occur in clusters which typically last for weeks or months and occasionally more than a year. The cause is unknown. Risk factors include a history of exposure to tobacco smoke and a family history of the condition. Exposures which may trigger attacks include alcohol, nitroglycerin, and histamine. They are a primary headache disorder of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias type. Diagnosis is based on symptoms. Recommended management includes lifestyle changes such as avoiding potential triggers. Treatments for acute attacks include oxygen or a fast-acting triptan. Measures recommended to decrease the frequency of attacks include steroid injections, civamide, or verapamil. Nerve stimulation or surgery may occasionally be used if other measures are not effective. The condition affects about 0.1% of the general population at some point in their life and 0.05% in any given year. The condition usually first occurs between 20 and 40 years of age. Men are affected about four times more often than women. Cluster headaches are named for the occurrence of groups of headache attacks (clusters). They have also been referred to as \\"suicide headaches\\". Signs and symptoms Cluster headaches are recurring bouts of severe unilateral headache attacks. The duration of a typical CH attack ranges from about 15 to 180 minutes. About 75% of untreated attacks last less than 60 minutes. However, females may have longer and more severe CH. The onset of an attack is rapid and typically without an aura. Preliminary sensations of pain in the general area of attack, referred to as \\"shadows\\", may signal an imminent CH, or these symptoms may linger after an attack has passed, or between attacks. Though CH is strictly unilateral, there are some documented cases of \\"side-shift\\" between cluster periods, or, rarely, simultaneous (within the same cluster period) bilateral cluster headaches. Pain The pain occurs only on one side of the head, around the eye, particularly above the eye, in the temple. The pain is typically greater than in other headache conditions, including migraines. The pain is typically described as burning, stabbing, drilling or squeezing, and may be located near or behind the eye. As a result of the pain, those with cluster headaches may experience suicidal thoughts during an attack (giving the alternative name \\"suicide headache\\" or \\"suicidal headache\\"). It is reported as one of the most painful conditions. Other symptoms The typical symptoms of cluster headache include grouped occurrence and recurrence (cluster) of headache attack, severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital and/or temporal pain. If left untreated, attack frequency may range from one attack every two days to eight attacks per day. Cluster headache attack is accompanied by at least one of the following autonomic symptoms: drooping eyelid, pupil constriction, redness of the conjunctiva, tearing, runny nose and less commonly, facial blushing, swelling, or sweating, typically appearing on the same side of the head as the pain. Restlessness (for example, pacing or rocking back and forth) may occur. Similar to a migraine, sensitivity to light (photophobia) or noise (phonophobia) may occur during a CH. Nausea is a rare symptom although it has been reported. Secondary effects may include the inability to organize thoughts and plans, physical exhaustion, confusion, agitation, aggressiveness, depression, and anxiety. People with CH may dread facing another headache and adjust their physical or social activities around a possible future occurrence. Likewise they may seek assistance to accomplish what would otherwise be normal tasks. They may hesitate to make plans because of the regularity, or conversely, the unpredictability of the pain schedule. These factors can lead to generalized anxiety disorders, panic disorder, serious depressive disorders, social withdrawal and isolation. Recurrence Cluster headaches may occasionally be referred to as \\"alarm clock headache\\" because of the regularity of their recurrence. CH attacks often awaken individuals from sleep. Both individual attacks and the cluster grouping can have a metronomic regularity; attacks typically striking at a precise time of day each morning or night. The recurrence of headache cluster grouping may occur more often around solstices, or seasonal changes, sometimes showing circannual periodicity. Conversely, attack frequency may be highly unpredictable, showing no periodicity at all. These observations have prompted researchers to speculate an involvement or dysfunction of the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the body's \\"biological clock\\" and circadian rhythm. In episodic cluster headache, attacks occur once or more daily, often at the same time each day for a period of several weeks, followed by a headache-free period lasting weeks, months, or years. Approximately 10–15% of cluster headaches are chronic, with multiple headaches occurring every day for years, sometimes without any remission. In accordance with the International Headache Society (IHS) diagnostic criteria, cluster headaches occurring in two or more cluster periods, lasting from 7 to 365 days with a pain-free remission of one month or longer between the headache attacks, may be classified as episodic. If headache attacks occur for more than a year without pain-free remission of at least one month, the condition is classified as chronic. Chronic CH both occurs and recurs without any remission periods between cycles; there may be variation in cycles, meaning the frequency and severity of attacks may change without predictability for a period of time. The frequency, severity, and duration of headache attacks experienced by people during these cycles varies between individuals and does not demonstrate complete remission of the episodic form. The condition may change unpredictably from chronic to episodic and from episodic to chronic. Causes { class=\\" floatright\\" -  150x150px  150x150px  150x150px -  colspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" Positron emission tomography (PET) shows brain areas being activated during pain -  150x150px  150x150px  150x150px -  colspan=\\"3\\" center;\\" Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) shows brain area structural differences } The cause of cluster headache is unknown. Cluster headaches were historically described as vascular headaches, with the belief that intense pain was caused by dilation of blood vessels which in turn, was thought to create pressure on the trigeminal nerve. The vascular theory has been called into question and other mechanisms are being considered. The Third Edition of the Internal Classification of Headache disorders classifies CH as belonging to the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. Nerves Two categories of nerves are thought to play an important role in CH: the trigeminal nerve in mediating pain and the facial nerve for producing the local ipsilateral autonomic signs such as rhinorrhea, conjunctival injection, and lacrimation. Genetics Cluster headache may, but rarely, run in some families in an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. People with a first degree relative with the condition are about 14–48 times more likely to develop it themselves, and around 6.3% of persons with CH have a positive family history. Several studies have found a higher number of relatives affected among female. Others have suggested these observations may be due to lower numbers of females in these studies. Possible genetic factors warrant further research, current evidence for genetic inheritance is limited. Tobacco smoking About 65% of persons with CH are, or have been, tobacco smokers. Stopping smoking does not lead to improvement of the condition and CH also occurs in those who have never smoked (e.g. children); it is thought unlikely that smoking is a cause. People with CH may be predisposed to certain traits, including smoking or other lifestyle habits. Hypothalamus A review suggests that the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which is the major biological clock in the human body, may be involved in cluster headaches, because CH occurs with diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity. Positron emission tomography (PET) scans indicate the brain areas which are activated during attack only, compared to pain free periods. These pictures show brain areas that are active during pain in yellow/orange color (called \\"pain matrix\\"). The area in the center (in all three views) is specifically activated during CH only. The bottom row voxel-based morphometry (VBM) shows structural brain differences between individuals with and without CH; only a portion of the hypothalamus is different. Diagnosis Cluster-like head pain may be diagnosed as secondary headache rather than cluster headache. A detailed oral history aids practitioners in correct differential diagnosis, as there are no confirmatory tests for CH. A headache diary can be useful in tracking when and where pain occurs, how severe it is, and how long the pain lasts. A record of coping strategies used may help distinguish between headache type; data on frequency, severity and duration of headache attacks are a necessary tool for initial and correct differential diagnosis in headache conditions. Correct diagnosis presents a challenge as the first CH attack may present where staff are not trained in the diagnosis of rare or complex chronic disease. Although experienced ER staff are sometimes trained to detect headache types, CH attacks themselves are not directly life- threatening, they are linked to an increased risk of suicide. Individuals with CH typically experience diagnostic delay before correct diagnosis. People are often misdiagnosed due to reported neck, tooth, jaw, and sinus symptoms and may unnecessarily endure many years of referral to ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists for investigation of sinuses; dentists for tooth assessment; chiropractors and manipulative therapists for treatment; or psychiatrists, psychologists, and other medical disciplines before their headaches are correctly diagnosed. Under-recognition of CH by health care professionals is reflected in consistent findings in Europe and the United States that the average time to diagnosis is around seven years. Differential Cluster headache may be misdiagnosed as migraine or sinusitis. Other types of headache are sometimes mistaken for, or may mimic closely, CH. Incorrect terms like \\"cluster migraine\\" confuse headache types, confound differential diagnosis and are often the cause of unnecessary diagnostic delay, ultimately delaying appropriate specialist treatment. Headaches that may be confused with CH include: *Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) is a unilateral headache condition, without the male predominance usually seen in CH. Paroxysmal hemicrania may also be episodic but the episodes of pain seen in CPH are usually shorter than those seen with cluster headaches. CPH typically responds \\"absolutely\\" to treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin where in most cases CH typically shows no positive indomethacin response, making \\"Indomethacin response\\" an important diagnostic tool for specialist practitioners seeking correct differential diagnosis between the conditions. * Hemicrania continua * Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT) is a headache syndrome belonging to the group of TACs. * Trigeminal neuralgia is a unilateral headache syndrome, or \\"cluster-like\\" headache. Prevention Preventive treatments are used to reduce or eliminate cluster headache attacks; they are generally used in combination with abortive and transitional techniques. Verapamil The recommended first-line preventive therapy is verapamil, a calcium channel blocker. Verapamil was previously underused in people with cluster headache. Improvement can be seen in an average of 1.7 weeks for episodic CH and 5 weeks for chronic CH when using a dosage of ranged between 160 and 720 mg (mean 240 mg/day). Preventive therapy with verapamil is believed to work because it has an effect on the circadian rhythm and on CGRPs. As CGRP-release is controlled by voltage-gated calcium channels. Glucocorticoids There is little evidence to support a long-term benefit from glucocorticoids, but they may be used until other medications take effect as they appear to be effective at three days. They are generally discontinued after 8–10 days of treatment. Surgery Nerve stimulators may be an option in the small number of people who do not improve with medications. Two procedures, deep brain stimulation or occipital nerve stimulation, may be useful; early experience shows a benefit in about 60% of cases. It typically takes weeks or months for this benefit to appear. A non-invasive method using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is being studied. A number of surgical procedures, such as a rhizotomy or microvascular decompression, may also be considered, but evidence to support them is limited and there are cases of people whose symptoms worsen after these procedures. Other Lithium, methysergide, and topiramate are recommended alternative treatments, although there is little evidence supporting the use of topiramate or methysergide. This is also true for tianeptine, melatonin, and ergotamine. Valproate, sumatriptan, and oxygen are not recommended as preventive measures. Botulinum toxin injections have shown limited success. Evidence for baclofen, botulinum toxin, and capsaicin is unclear. Management Treatment for cluster headache is divided into three primary categories: abortive, transitional, and preventive. There are two primary treatments for acute CH: oxygen and triptans, but they are underused due to misdiagnosis of the syndrome. During bouts of headaches, triggers such as alcohol, nitroglycerine and naps during the day should be avoided. Oxygen Oxygen therapy may help to abort attacks, though it does not prevent future episodes. Typically it is given via a non-rebreather mask at 12–15 liters per minute for 15–20 minutes. One review found about 70% of patients improve within 15 minutes. The evidence for effectiveness of 100% oxygen, however, is weak. Hyperbaric oxygen at pressures of ~2 times greater than atmospheric pressure may relieve cluster headaches. Triptans The other primarily recommended treatment of acute attacks is subcutaneous or intranasal sumatriptan. Sumatriptan and zolmitriptan have both been shown to improve symptoms during an attack with sumatriptan being superior. Because of the vasoconstrictive side-effect of triptans, they may be contraindicated in people with ischemic heart disease. Opioids The use of opioid medication in management of CH is not recommended and may make headache syndromes worse. Long-term opioid use is associated with well known dependency, addiction, and withdrawal syndromes. Prescription of opioid medication may additionally lead to further delay in differential diagnosis, undertreatment, and mismanagement. Other The vasoconstrictor ergot compounds may be useful, but have not been well studied in acute attacks. Octreotide administered subcutaneously has been demonstrated to be more effective than placebo for the treatment of acute attacks. Intranasal lidocaine (sprayed in the ipsilateral nostril) may be an effective treatment with patient resistant to more conventionnal treatment. Epidemiology Cluster headache affects about 0.1% of the general population at some point in their life. Males are affected about four times more often than females. The condition usually starts between the ages of 20 and 50 years, although it can occur at any age. About one in five of adults reports the onset of cluster headache between 10 and 19 years. History The first complete description of cluster headache was given by the London neurologist Wilfred Harris in 1926, who named the disease migrainous neuralgia.Harris W.: Neuritis and Neuralgia. p. 307-12. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1926. Descriptions of CH date to 1745 and probably earlier. The condition was originally named Horton's cephalalgia after Bayard Taylor Horton, a US neurologist who postulated the first theory as to their pathogenesis. His original paper describes the severity of the headaches as being able to take normal men and force them to attempt or complete suicide; his 1939 paper said: > \\"Our patients were disabled by the disorder and suffered from bouts of pain > from two to twenty times a week. They had found no relief from the usual > methods of treatment. Their pain was so severe that several of them had to > be constantly watched for fear of suicide. Most of them were willing to > submit to any operation which might bring relief.\\" CH has alternately been called erythroprosopalgia of Bing, ciliary neuralgia, erythromelalgia of the head, Horton's headache, histaminic cephalalgia, petrosal neuralgia, sphenopalatine neuralgia, vidian neuralgia, Sluder's neuralgia, Sluder's syndrome, and hemicrania angioparalyticia.  Society and culture  Robert Shapiro, a professor of neurology, says that while cluster headaches are about as common as multiple sclerosis with a similar disability level, as of 2013, the US National Institutes of Health had spent $1.872 billion on research into multiple sclerosis in one decade, but less than $2 million on CH research in 25 years. there are no approved medicines for the prevention of cluster headache in the United States.  Research directions  Some controversial case reports suggest that ingesting tryptamines such as LSD, psilocybin (as found in hallucinogenic mushrooms), or DMT can reduce pain and interrupt cluster headache cycles. A 2006 survey of 53 individuals found people said that psilocybin extended remission periods in 18 of 19. The survey was not a blinded or a controlled study, and was \\"limited by recall and selection bias\\". The safety and efficacy of psilocybin is currently being studied in cluster headache. Fremanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against calcitonin gene-related peptides alpha and beta, is in phase 3 clinical trials for CH.

Commissioned by Paul Sacher to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the chamber orchestra Basler Kammerorchester, the score is dated September 7, 1936. The work was premiered in Basel, Switzerland on January 21, 1937 by the chamber orchestra conducted by Sacher, and it was published the same year by Universal Edition. Analysis As its title indicates, the piece is written for string instruments (violins, violas, cellos, double basses, and harp), percussion instruments (xylophone, snare drum, cymbals, tam-tam, bass drum, and timpani) and celesta. The ensemble also includes a piano, which may be classified as either a percussion or string instrument (the celesta player also plays piano during 4-hand passages). Bartók divides the strings into two groups which he directs should be placed antiphonally on opposite sides of the stage, and he makes use of antiphonal effects particularly in the second and fourth movements. The piece is in four movements, the first and third slow, the second and fourth quick. All movements are written without key signature: Example of interval expansion: movement I, mm. 1–5 and movement IV, mm. 204–209. The first movement is a slow fugue with a constantly changing time signature. The movement is based around the note A, on which the movement begins and ends. It begins on muted strings, and as more voices enter, the texture thickens and the music becomes louder until the climax on E, a tritone away from A. Mutes are then removed, and the music becomes gradually quieter over gentle celesta arpeggios. The movement ends with the second phrase of the fugue subject played softly over its inversion. Material from the first movement can be seen as serving as the basis for the later movements, and the fugue subject recurs in different guises at points throughout the piece. The second movement is quick, with a theme in time which is transformed into time towards the end. It is marked with a loud syncopated piano and percussion accents in a whirling dance, evolving in an extended pizzicato section, with a piano concerto-like conclusion. The third movement is slow, an example of what is often called Bartók's \\"night music\\". It features timpani glissandi, which was an unusual technique at the time of the work's composition, as well as a prominent part for the xylophone. It is also commonly thought that the rhythm of the xylophone solo that opens the third movement is based on the Fibonacci sequence as this \\"written-out accelerando/ritardando\\" uses the rhythm 1:1:2:3:5:8:5:3:2:1:1. The last movement, which begins with notes on the timpani and strummed pizzicato chords on the strings, has the character of a lively folk dance. Popular culture The popularity of the Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta is demonstrated by the use of themes from this work in films and popular music. The second movement of this work accompanies \\"Craig's Dance of Despair and Disillusionment\\" from the film Being John Malkovich. The Adagio movement was used as the theme music for The Vampira Show (1954–1955). The movement was also featured in the Encyclopaedia Britannica film The Solar System (1977) and the Stanley Kubrick film The Shining (1980). Jerry Goldsmith would write in the style of this piece for the 1962 film Freud: The Secret Passion. It also was the soundtrack for the 1978 Australian film Money Movers. Also the work is sampled by Anthony \\"Ant\\" Davis from the underground hip hop group Atmosphere, from Minneapolis, on the song \\"Aspiring Sociopath\\" of their album Lucy Ford. The architect Steven Holl used the overlapping strettos that occur in this piece as a parallel on which the form of the Stretto House (1989) in Dallas, Texas was made.

He founded and conducted the Basler Kammerorchester (1926–1987). He commissioned notable works of composers of the 20th century and premiered them with the chamber orchestra. While better known for his interest in new music, he was also devoted to music of baroque and classical eras; he founded the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, institute for early music, in 1933. Biography Sacher studied under Felix Weingartner, among others. In 1926 he founded the chamber orchestra Basler Kammerorchester, which specialized in both modern (twentieth-century) and pre-classical (mid- eighteenth-century) repertory. In 1928 he founded the Basel Chamber Choir. Both the orchestra and choir gave their last performance in 1987.http://www.brikcius.com/Projects.uk.eSACHERe.html In 1984, the Serenata Basel was formed, with no direct connection to Sacher. They later adopted the name Kammerorchester Basel. He also founded the Collegium Musicum Zürich in 1941 with Walter Schulthess and Stefi Geyer which he conducted until its disbandment in 1992.> Commissions Immensely wealthy, Sacher commissioned works from many well-known composers, including: *Igor Stravinsky (who provided him with the Concerto in D) *Béla Bartók (Divertimento for Strings, the Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, the String Quartet No. 6 and the Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta) *Bohuslav Martinů (many works including the Double Concerto for Two String Orchestras, Piano, and Timpani, Concerto da camera, etc.) *Arthur Honegger (many works, including his Second and Fourth Symphony (Deliciae Basilienses) *Frank Martin (six works, including the Petite Symphonie Concertante) *Paul Hindemith *Hans Werner Henze *Richard Strauss *Elliott Carter *Witold Lutosławski (Sacher-Variationen, Double Concerto, Chain II) *Henri Dutilleux (Trois strophes sur le nom de Sacher and Mystère de l'instant) *Harrison Birtwistle Pierre Boulez wrote his Grawemeyer Award-winning work Sur Incises for Sacher's 90th birthday. Boulez bequeathed his entire catalogue (including drafts) to the Paul Sacher Foundation. Henze dedicated his Tenth Symphony to Sacher's memory, who had commissioned it but died before its completion. In 1983, Sacher acquired the Stravinsky estate.>\\"The Founder\\" : Chronology, Paul Sacher Foundation. The Paul Sacher Stiftung (Foundation) is located in the centre of Basel (in Münsterplatz) and houses one of the world's most important musical-manuscript collections. Sacher bought most of these manuscripts himself, and they include complete collections by several important twentieth-century composers (including Lutosławski, Ligeti and Boulez). In 1997, he received an honorary doctorate from the Academy of Music in Kraków. He was considered the world's third- richest man of the 1990s after marrying the heiress of the pharmaceutical company Hoffmann-La Roche. At the time of his death, he was reputed in various publications to be the richest man in Europe. He died in 1999, aged 93. Perhaps his finest recorded performance was preserved on mid-1950s late mono Columbia LP, Johann Christian Bach's Symphony in D major, Op. 18, No. 4, distinguished by its overall serenity, stylishness and smooth flow but also by his taking BOTH repeats (including the second long one, apparently never since taken in later recordings) of the rondo finale quintessentially representative of Johann Christian's serene melding of pre-classical galant (in the opening and closing rondo theme) and sensitive styles (in the canonic middle episode in D minor). \\"eSACHERe\\" On the occasion of Sacher's 70th birthday, twelve composer-friends of his (Conrad Beck, Luciano Berio, Pierre Boulez, Benjamin Britten, Henri Dutilleux, Wolfgang Fortner, Alberto Ginastera, Cristóbal Halffter, Hans Werner Henze, Heinz Holliger, Klaus Huber and Witold Lutosławski) were asked by Russian cellist Mstislav Rostropovich to write compositions for cello solo using his name spelled out in musical notes (musical cryptogram) as the theme (eS, A, C, H, E, Re). Many of them were performed in a Zurich concert on 2 May 1976.

He is known for his career at the University of Arkansas. He served as the head football coach for one season at the University of Missouri in 1957 and at the University of Arkansas from 1958 to 1976. Broyles also was Arkansas' athletic director from 1974 until his retirement on December 31, 2007. As a head football coach, Broyles compiled a record of 149–62–6. His mark of 144–58–5 in 19 seasons is the most wins and the most games of any head coach in Arkansas Razorbacks football history. With Arkansas, Broyles won seven Southwest Conference titles and his 1964 team was named a national champion by a number of selectors including the Football Writers Association of America. Broyles is considered one of the finest head coaches in college football history. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. Playing career After his graduation from Decatur Boys High School, Broyles studied at Georgia Tech, where he was a quarterback from 1944 to 1946. He graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in Industrial Management. Broyles started all of Tech's games at quarterback during his senior season, and led the Yellow Jackets to the 1945 Orange Bowl. Tech lost the bowl game, but in defeat Broyles set an Orange Bowl record for passing yards with 304. The record stood for 55 years until eclipsed by Michigan quarterback Tom Brady in the 2000 Orange Bowl. Broyles is a member of the Orange Bowl (1991), Gator Bowl (1995), and Cotton Bowl Classic (1999) halls of fame, and the Georgia Tech Hall of Fame. Broyles was later drafted by the Chicago Bears in the third round of the 1946 NFL Draft. Coaching career Broyles entered coaching in 1947 as an assistant coach under head coach Bob Woodruff at Baylor University. In 1950, Broyles followed Woodruff when the latter took the head coach position at the University of Florida. In 1951, he left Florida and returned to Georgia Tech as an offensive coordinator under coach Bobby Dodd. Broyles sought the head coaching position at Northwestern University in 1954, and ultimately left Georgia Tech in 1957 when he was offered the position of head coach at the University of Missouri. Broyles stayed at Missouri only one season when he was offered the head coaching job at Arkansas. During his nineteen years as head coach there, he was offered other major coaching and leadership positions, but remained at Arkansas. During his tenure at Arkansas, Broyles coached the Razorbacks to seven Southwest Conference championships, and two Cotton Bowl Classic wins. His 1964 team was proclaimed national champions by the Football Writers Association of America, as well as the Helms Foundation, and to date is the last Razorback team to go undefeated and untied in a season. If the wire service polls had not given out their national championships prior to the bowl games during that era of college football, Arkansas positively would have won both the AP and the UPI national titles as well, since Alabama (winner of both) lost to Texas (a team Arkansas beat in Austin in 1964) in the Orange Bowl. He still holds the record for most wins by a head coach in the history of Arkansas football, with 144. During the 1960s and 1970s, one of college football's most intense rivalries was between Broyles' Razorbacks and the University of Texas Longhorns under legendary coach Darrell Royal. Among Broyles' most memorable victories while coaching the Razorbacks was the 14-13 win over #1 Texas in 1964 in Austin, the 1965 Cotton Bowl victory over Nebraska to complete an undefeated season, the 1969 Sugar Bowl victory over Georgia, beating #2 Texas A&M; in the 1975 season finale to win a share of the SWC championship, and then beating Georgia in the 1976 Cotton Bowl. The two most painful losses in his tenure at Arkansas, included the 1966 Cotton Bowl loss to LSU that snapped Arkansas' 22 game winning streak, and, most famously, the 1969 Game of the Century that saw #1 Texas come from behind to beat #2 Arkansas, 15-14. Broadcasting career After his retirement from coaching, but concurrent with the early part of his tenure as men's athletic director at Arkansas, Broyles served as the primary color commentator for ABC Sports television coverage of college football, normally alongside top play-by-play man Keith Jackson. Broyles' time as a broadcaster at ABC lasted from 1977 to 1985. Broyles was often assigned games involving Southeastern Conference or Southwest Conference teams, but if the primary game of a particular week involved the Razorbacks, Broyles was paired with another play-by-play man, many times Al Michaels or Chris Schenkel, while Jackson called the game with another color commentator, many times Ara Parseghian. Broyles' commentary was normally focused on play calling and coaching strategy, and while paired with Jackson, resulted in an all-Georgian booth (Jackson was a native of Roopville). As a member of Augusta National Golf Club, Broyles from 1972 to 1977 co-hosted (with tournament chairmen Clifford Roberts and William Lane) the green jacket presentation ceremony at the end of the Masters Tournament from Butler Cabin televised on CBS. Athletic director In 1974 Broyles was appointed Men's Athletic Director of the University of Arkansas. (Arkansas had a completely separate women's athletics department from 1971 until the men's and women's programs were merged in 2008.) Broyles continued as head football coach for three years. Since stepping down as head coach, the University of Arkansas men's athletic programs, under his leadership as athletic director, have won 43 national championships. The Razorbacks have won 57 Southwest Conference championships and 47 Southeastern Conference championships while he has been men's athletic director. As athletic Director of Arkansas Broyles cancelled the men's swimming and diving program to satisfy new regulations from the SEC of having two more women's sports than men's sports. On February 17, 2007, Broyles announced his plans to retire as Men's Athletic Director, effective December 31, 2007, ending his half-century association with Arkansas. Criticism In 2000, following an expansion of Razorback Stadium, Broyles announced that one home game would move from War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock to Fayetteville, and that, in the near future, all home games might be played on campus. In the end, a long term agreement was reached to keep 2-3 games in Little Rock, while the rest would be played in Fayetteville. Legacy Broyles (center) with Reps. Vic Snyder (left) and Mike Ross (right) Over thirty of his former players have also become college or professional football coaches. Broyles is known for producing high quality coaches and the prestigious Broyles Award, the annual award for best assistant coach, is named after him. Barry Switzer, Johnny Majors, Joe Gibbs, Hayden Fry, and Jimmy Johnson all served under Broyles and have combined to win five collegiate national championships and six Super Bowls. Broyles' assistants have won more than 40 conference titles. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones played on Broyles' 1964 Championship team. Broyles' tenure as men's athletic director has seen the construction of world-class facilities for basketball, football, track and field (indoor and outdoor), golf, and baseball at Arkansas. Broyles was selected as the 20th century's most influential Arkansas sports figure. Broyles will be remembered as the only SEC athletic director that had to drop a men's sport bringing into questions the health of the athletic department under his leadership. Broyles was known as a fierce competitor both as a head coach and athletic director. Broyles led Arkansas out of the Southwest Conference and into the Southeastern Conference. In 1983 Broyles was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, and in 1996, the Broyles Award was established to recognize the top assistant coaches in college football. He was a member of the Augusta National Golf Club.Augusta National Golf Club members list, USA Today In 2005, after his wife Barbara was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, Broyles became an outspoken advocate for Alzheimer's awareness and established the Frank and Barbara Broyles Foundation to support caregivers of Alzheimer's patients. With the assistance of the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences, he published and distributed 100,000 free copies of a book titled Coach Broyles' Playbook for Alzheimer's Caregivers to pharmacies throughout the state of Arkansas. In 2007 and again in 2009, Broyles successfully raised funds to distribute 500,000 copies of the book nationally, plus 100,000 copies in Spanish. Since then, the book has been translated into 11 different languages and distributed digitally worldwide. Broyles himself would eventually succumb to complications of the same disease on August 14, 2017.

Writing and recording  The group had recorded the songs in a five-day stretch during February of the same year. It was to be the last album to feature founding member Miroslav Vitouš as the primary bassist. Zawinul began to assert greater control of the band, steering it away from the collective improvisation that marked its live performances toward more structured compositions emphasizing funk and groove. This was exemplified by the album's two dominant tracks, \\"Boogie Woogie Waltz\\" and \\"125th Street Congress,\\" as well as the closer, \\"Non-Stop Home.\\" Other tracks were reminiscent of Weather Report's previous albums. Sweetnighter is considered to be the most stylistically transitional release by the band as it bridged the gap between the more open, improvisational earlier style to a more compositionally structured format. Also, the more prominent use of electric bass is evident here. Zawinul had taken the decision to add some funky beats in the band's sounds, so he recruited drummer Herschel Dwellingham and percussionist Muruga Booker to play on the album. Andrew White was hired to play the English horn, but also handled the bass for three tracks of the album. Sweetnighter was recorded at a Connecticut recording studio in less than a week, and was released in April 1973.  Critical reception  Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \\"Ask yourself: What kind of a jazz (or rock) (or jazz- rock) group would conceive its sonar identity around electric keyboards and soprano sax? A pretty dinky (not dunky) one, right? So while I'm pleased that they're going for a drum groove a little solider than anything Dom Um Romao can move and shake, I'm not surprised that they get it only—just barely, in fact—on '125th Street congress.' And that 'Boogie Woogie Waltz' is fatally cute, ace improvisations and all.\\"  Legacy  \\"Boogie Woogie Waltz\\" was frequently in the band's live sets through the 1970s, and a live version from 1978 appeared on the album 8:30.

It is based on two sites; the City Campus is located in the city centre near Sheffield railway station, while the Collegiate Crescent Campus is about two miles away in the Broomhall Estate off Ecclesall Road in south-west Sheffield. The university is the largest university in the UK (out of ) with students (of whom 4,400 are international students), 4,494 staff and 708 courses. History Foundation and growth In 1843 as the industrial revolution gathered pace and Sheffield was on the verge of becoming the steel, tool and cutlery making capital of the world, the Sheffield School of Design was founded following lobbying by artist Benjamin Haydon. The day-to-day running was controlled by the local council, whilst the Board of Trade in London appointed the head. Tuition began in a 60x40ft rented room off Glossop Road.Basford, John A School of Art is Beginning, From Sheffield Government School of Design to Sheffield Hallam University, Part 1 1843–1963, Sheffield, Sheffield Hallam University, p. 3 In 1850 the School of Design was renamed Sheffield School of Art. In 1905 the City of Sheffield Training College (later renamed Sheffield City College of Education) on Collegiate Crescent admitted its first 90 students. During the First World War, the Collegiate Hall was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 3rd Northern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. In 1967 the Owen Building was constructed. Built in a functional 1960s design, it has since been modernised and comprehensively renovated with an atrium linking it to four adjacent buildings. In 1969 the Sheffield School of Design merged with the city's College of Technology to form Sheffield Polytechnic. In 1976 Sheffield Polytechnic merged with the city's two teacher training colleges (Sheffield City College and Totley Hall College) and was renamed Sheffield City Polytechnic. In 1987 Sheffield City Polytechnic became a founding member of the Northern Consortium.see University status to present day In 1992 Sheffield City Polytechnic became Sheffield Hallam University (SHU), with the right to award its own degrees. In 2005 SHU was reorganised into four faculties. The new Faculty of Development and Society, with an emphasis on 'people, places and spaces', brought together education, geography, humanities, law, and social sciences. At the same time, with the intention of further developing research and teaching in the new Faculty of Health and Wellbeing, a new Clinical Academic Group was launched. The building that had been designed and constructed to house the National Centre for Popular Music became the university's students' union building (the HUBS). The Nelson Mandela Building, the former students' union building, was sold and has since been demolished. In 2007 SHU took over the teaching of nursing and midwifery from the University of Sheffield. These activities are now based at the Collegiate Crescent Campus. The following year the Psalter Lane campus (formerly the Sheffield College of Art) was closed, and the activities transferred to the City Campus. The £26 million energy-efficient Furnival Building opened in September (renamed Cantor Building in 2011 in recognition of a major donor to the university). The building, which includes teaching spaces and an art gallery has been described as \\"the impressive new entry point to the campus\\".

Aarati(s) also refers to the songs sung in praise of the deity, when the light is being offered. Origin Aarati is derived from the Sanskrit word आरात्रिक () which means something that removes ', darkness (or light waved in darkness before an icon).आरात्रिक Sanskrit English Dictionary, GermanyJames Lochtefeld, An illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, , page 51Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary; Quote: ArAtrika n. the light (or the vessel containing it) which is waved at night before an icon; N. of this ceremony. A Marathi language reference sayshttp://www.marathivishwakosh.in/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=4661%3A2010-11-15-06-28-12&catid;=2&Itemid;=3 it is also known as Mahaneeranjana (Sanskrit: महानीराञ्जना).https://wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Konkani_Viswakosh_Vol1.pdf/191 Aarti is said to have descended from the Vedic concept of fire rituals, or homa. In the traditional aarti ceremony, the flower represents the earth (solidity), the water and accompanying handkerchief correspond with the water element (liquidity), the ghee or oil lamp represents the fire component (heat), the peacock fan conveys the precious quality of air (movement), and the yak-tail fan represents the subtle form of ether (space). The incense represents a purified state of mind, and one's \\"intelligence\\" is offered through the adherence to rules of timing and order of offerings. Thus, one's entire existence and all facets of material creation are symbolically offered to the Lord via the aarti ceremony.Rosen, Steven (2006). Essential Hinduism. Praeger Publishers. The word may also refer to the traditional Hindu devotional song that is sung during the ritual. Practice Aarti can be simple to extravagant, but always includes flame or light. It is sometimes performed one to five times daily, and usually at the end of a puja (in southern India) or bhajan session (in northern India). It is performed during almost all Hindu ceremonies and occasions. It involves the circulating of an 'Aarti plate' or 'Aarti lamp' around a person or deity and is generally accompanied by the congregation singing songs in praise of that deva or person - many versions exist. In most versions the plate, lamp, or flame represents the power of the deity. The priest circulates the plate or lamp to all those present. They cup their down-turned hands over the flame and then raise their palms to their forehead – the blessing has now been passed to the devotee. The aarti plate is generally made of metal, usually silver, bronze or copper. On it must repose a lamp made of kneaded flour, mud or metal, filled with oil or ghee. One or more cotton wicks (always an odd number) are put into the oil and then lighted, or camphor is burnt instead. The plate may also contain flowers, incense and akshata (rice).Akshata: (Sanskrit) \\"Unbroken.\\" Unmilled, uncooked rice, often mixed with turmeric, offered as a sacred substance during puja, or in blessings for individuals at weddings and other ceremonies. This, the very best food, is the finest offering a devotee can give to God or a wife can give to her husband. In some temples, a plate is not used and the priest holds the ghee lamp in his hand when offering it to the Deities. The purpose of performing aarti is the waving of lighted wicks before the deities in a spirit of humility and gratitude, wherein faithful followers become immersed in god's divine form. It symbolises the five elements: # Space (Akash) # Wind (Vayu) # Fire (Agni) # Water (Jal) # Earth (Prithvi) Community Aarti is performed in the mandir; however, devotees also perform it in their homes. Significance Taking Aarti blessing during a Durga puja celebration. Aarti can be an expression of many things including love, benevolence, gratitude, prayers, or desires depending on the object it is done to/ for. For example, it can be a form of respect when performed to elders, prayers when performed to deities, or hope when performed for homes or vehicles. Emotions and prayers are often silent while doing Aarti, but this is determined by the person carrying out the ritual or the holiday involved. It's also believed that goodwill and luck can be taken through symbolic hand movements over the flame. When aarti is performed, the performer faces the deity of god (or divine element, e.g. Ganges river) and concentrates on the form of god by looking into the eyes of the deity (it is said that eyes are the windows to the soul) to get immersed. The flame of the aarti illuminates the various parts of the deity so that the performer and onlookers may better see and concentrate on the form. Aarti is waved in circular fashion, in clockwise manner around the deity. After every circle (or second or third circle), when Aarti has reached the bottom (6–8 o'clock position), the performer waves it backwards while remaining in the bottom (4–6 o'clock position) and then continues waving it in clockwise fashion. The idea here is that aarti represents our daily activities, which revolves around god, a center of our life. Looking at god while performing aarti reminds the performer (and the attendees of the aarti) to keep god at the center of all activities and reinforces the understanding that routine worldly activities are secondary in importance. This understanding would give the believers strength to withstand the unexpected grief and keeps them humble and remindful of god during happy moments. Apart from worldly activities aarti also represents one's self - thus, aarti signifies that one is peripheral to godhead or divinity. This would keep one's ego down and help one remain humble in spite of high social and economic rank. A third commonly held understanding of the ritual is that aarti serves as a reminder to stay vigilant so that the forces of material pleasures and desires cannot overcome the individual. Just as the lighted wick provides light and chases away darkness, the vigilance of an individual can keep away the influence of the material world.Rosen, Steven. Essential Hinduism. 1st. Westport: Praeger Publishers, 2006. Aarti is not only limited to god. Aarti can performed not only to all forms of life, but also inanimate objects which help in progress of the culture. This is exemplified by performer of the aarti waving aarti to all the devotees as the aarti comes to the end – signifying that everyone has a part of god within that the performer respects and bows down to. It is also a common practice to perform aarti to inanimate objects like vehicles, electronics etc. at least when a Hindu starts using it, just as a gesture of showing respect and praying that this object would help one excel in the work one would use it for. It is similar to the ritual of doing auspicious red mark(s) using kanku (kumkum) and rice. Aarti songs Aarti dance in Bangalore, 2009. Hinduism has a long tradition of aarti songs, simply referred to as 'Aarti', sung as an accompaniment to the ritual of aarti. It primarily eulogizes to the deity the ritual is being offered to, and several sects have their own version of the common aarti songs that are often sung on chorus at various temples, during evening and morning aartis. Sometimes they also contain snippets of information on the life of the gods. The most commonly sung aarti is that which is dedicated to all deities is Om Jai Jagdish Hare, known as \\"The Universal Aarti\\" and is another common aarti song. Its variation are used for other deities as well such as Om Jai Shiv omkara, Om Jai Lakshmi mata, Om Jai Ambe gauri, Om Jai Adya Shakti, Om Jai Saraswati Mata, Om Jai Gange Mata, Om Jai Tulsi Mata and Om Jai Surya Bhagvaan. In Ganesha worship, the aarti Sukhakarta Dukhaharta is popular in Maharashtra. In Swaminarayan Mandirs, Jai Sadguru Swami is the aarti that is sung. In most temples in India, aarti is performed at least twice a day, after the ceremonial puja, which is the time when the largest number of devotees congregates. In Pushtimarg Havelis, aarti is performed by a sole mukhiyaji (priest) while Haveli Sangeet (Kirtan) is being sung. Devotees only watch the aarti being done and do not get to take a major part in it. During bhajan or utsavs (festivals) celebrated at home, Jai Jai Shree Yamuna is sung while devotees perform aarti. It is said that Sandhya Aarti is done to see if Lord Shrinathji had gotten hurt while playing outside because it is performed after sundown. In Sikhism the aarti sung is Gagan mein thaal. Aarti in southern Indian temples  Aarti performed at southern Indian temples consists of offering a camphor lamp (or oil lamp) to the Deities and then distributing it to the devotees, who line up. They hover their hands over the flame and touch their hands to their eyes, this may be done once or three times. It is the last ritual performed in puja. Aarti is also referred to as Deepa Aaradhanai in Tamil, Deepaaradhane’’ in Kannada, Deepaaradhanamu or \\"Haarati\\" in Telugu, Deepaaradhana in Malayalam. Aarti in Gaudiya Vaishnavism In Gaudiya Vaishnavism, aarti refers to the whole puja ritual, of which offering the lamp is only one part. A shankha (conch) is blown to start the aarti, then an odd number of incense sticks are offered to the deity. The lamp is offered next, and then circulated among the devotees. A conch is then filled with water, and offered; the water is then poured into a sprinkler and sprinkled over the devotees. A cloth and flowers are then offered, and the flowers are circulated to the devotees, who sniff them. The deity is then fanned with a camara whisk, and a peacock fan in hot countries. Aarti dance in Durga Puja During the Bengali festival Durga Puja ritual drummers – dhakis, carrying large leather-strung dhak, show off their skills during ritual dance worships called Aarati or Dhunuchi dance. Aarti in Sikhism Amritsari Sikhs have not been performing Aarti as Hindus perform, but instead sing 'Aarti Kirtan', which are a few shabads from Guru Nanak, Ravidas and other Bhagats/Gurus. Few Nihangs’s Aarti includes some more shabads from the Dasam Granth and Sarabloh Granth. According to them, Aarti is the Aarti of divine wisdom, which is in form of Guru Granth Sahib. The concept is similar to bowing before Guru Granth Sahib on knees.

The Church of All Worlds (CAW) is an American Neopagan religious group whose stated mission is to evolve a network of information, mythology, and experience that provides a context and stimulus for reawakening Gaia and reuniting her children through tribal community dedicated to responsible stewardship and evolving consciousness. It is based in Cotati, California. The key founder of CAW is Oberon Zell-Ravenheart, who serves the Church as \\"Primate\\", later along with his wife, Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart (d. 2014), designated High Priestess. CAW was formed in 1962, evolving from a group of friends and lovers who were in part inspired by a fictional religion of the same name in the science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) by Robert A. Heinlein; the church's mythology includes science fiction to this day. CAW's members, called Waterkin, espouse Paganism, but the Church is not a belief-based religion. Members experience Divinity and honor these experiences while also respecting the views of others. They recognize \\"Gaea,\\" the Earth Mother Goddess and the Father God, as well as the realm of Faeries and the deities of many other pantheons. Many of their ritual celebrations are centered on the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece. Formation CAW began in 1961 with a group of high school friends. One of these was Richard Lance Christie from Tulsa, Oklahoma. Christie was fascinated by the \\"self-actualization\\" concepts of Abraham Maslow, a renowned American psychologist, and after meeting then- Timothy Zell at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, he began experiments in extrasensory perception. It was during this time that the group read Heinlein's science fiction novel, Stranger in a Strange Land (1961), which became the inspiration for CAW. Heinlein's book, combined with Maslow's self- actualization concepts, led to the formation of a waterbrotherhood that Zell and Christie called Atl, the Aztec word for \\"water\\", and also meaning \\"home of our ancestors\\". Atl became dedicated to political and social change and the group grew to about 100 members. Zell formed CAW from Atl, and filed for incorporation as a church in 1967. It was formally chartered on March 4, 1968, making it the first Earth religion to obtain full United States recognition as a church. Early organization and beliefs CAW modeled its organization after the group in Heinlein's novel, as a series of 9 nests in circles of advancement that were each named after a planet. The basic dogma of the CAW was that there was no dogma – the basic \\"belief\\" was a stated \\"lack of belief\\". Within their religion, the only sin was hypocrisy and the only crime in the eyes of the church was interfering with another person. Evolution Moving toward an emphasis on nature eventually led to a breaking of the relationship between CAW and Atl. By 1974, CAW had nests in more than a dozen states around the United States. That year, Zell married Morning Glory (née Diana Moore) and in 1976 he and Morning Glory settled in Eugene, Oregon and then at the Coeden Brith land in northern California. When Zell stepped away from central leadership, the Church of All Worlds suffered internal strife that led to most of the church dissolving. By 1978 the focus and headquarters shifted to California with the Zells and the nine-circle nest structure was revamped. CAW then served for several years as an umbrella organization for its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries Morning Glory Zell founded the Ecosophical Research Association (ERA) in 1977 to research arcane lore and legends. Its first project of note was the creation of living unicorns in 1980, after noting that early art depicts the creatures as being more goat-like than horse-like. The Zells reconstructed what they claimed was an ancient unicorning procedure, a process involving surgically manipulating the horn buds of kids during their first week of life, and created several unicorns, some of which toured with the Ringling Brothers Circus for a time. The ERA sponsored a Mermaid expedition to Papua, New Guinea in 1985 Thomas R. Williams. \\"Identification of the Ri: Through Further Fieldwork in New Ireland, Papua New Guinea,\\" /Cryptozoology/ 4 (1985), 61-68, cited in Clark, /Unexplained!/. pp. 468. 471. and a later ERA project involved the May 1996 worldwide ritual to draw upon and re-activate the Oracle at Delphi. This rite involved a relatively early attempt at utilizing online community and internet-facilitated virtual community rituals conducted simultaneously across different time zones, led by Maerian Morris, another former High Priestess of CAW, working from Delphi. The reactivation of Delphi was the subject of a series of six editorials in Green Egg (issues 125 through 130) from November/December 1998 through September/October 1999.https://www.sidhevair.org/Editorials.html provides links to Green Egg articles 125 to 130. In 1978 CAW merged with Nemeton, a Pagan organization founded by Gwydion Pendderwen and Alison Harlow. In 1987 CAW also absorbed Forever Forests, another one of Pendderwen's organizations. An outgrowth of Forever Forests was founded in 1983 by Anodea Judith, past president and High Priestess of CAW, called Lifeways. The Holy Order of Mother Earth (HOME), founded in 1978 by the Zells, is another subsidiary, dedicated to magical living and working with the land. Oberon and Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart have appeared at over 20 Starwood Festivals (and a few WinterStar Symposiums) over the past 25 years; because of this, there has been a Church of All Worlds presence at Starwood, called the CAWmunity, for over a decade. Bio on Oberon Zell-Ravenheart's Official Website First Renaissance By the mid-1980s, CAW had practically ceased operation outside of Ukiah, California, where the Zells relocated in 1985. Anodea Judith assumed presidency until 1991, and the structure of the organization was revamped with plans for more nest meetings, training courses, new rituals, and publications. By the late 1980s CAW had increased membership internationally, becoming particularly strong in Australia, where it was legally incorporated in 1992. In 1998 Oberon Zell- Ravenheart took a year-and-a-day sabbatical from his role as Primate, and the church headquarters were moved to Toledo, Ohio. Attempted termination & Second Renaissance On August, 2004, the Board of Directors decided to terminate CAW due to financial and legal struggles. In January, 2006, due to the effort of Jack Crispin Cain to help save the organization, CAW was reestablished with Zells again assuming a leadership role. In 2007, Green Egg, CAW's influential journal, returned to publication in an online format. The \\"3rd Phoenix Resurrection of the Church\\" continues to the present.

In special and general relativity, a light cone is the path that a flash of light, emanating from a single event (localized to a single point in space and a single moment in time) and traveling in all directions, would take through spacetime. Details If one imagines the light confined to a two-dimensional plane, the light from the flash spreads out in a circle after the event E occurs, and if we graph the growing circle with the vertical axis of the graph representing time, the result is a cone, known as the future light cone. The past light cone behaves like the future light cone in reverse, a circle which contracts in radius at the speed of light until it converges to a point at the exact position and time of the event E. In reality, there are three space dimensions, so the light would actually form an expanding or contracting sphere in three-dimensional (3D) space rather than a circle in 2D, and the light cone would actually be a four-dimensional version of a cone whose cross- sections form 3D spheres (analogous to a normal three-dimensional cone whose cross-sections form 2D circles), but the concept is easier to visualize with the number of spatial dimensions reduced from three to two. This view of special relativity was first proposed by Albert Einstein's former professor Hermann Minkowski and is known as Minkowski space. The purpose was to create an invariant spacetime for all observers. To uphold causality, Minkowski restricted spacetime to non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry. Because signals and other causal influences cannot travel faster than light (see special relativity), the light cone plays an essential role in defining the concept of causality: for a given event E, the set of events that lie on or inside the past light cone of E would also be the set of all events that could send a signal that would have time to reach E and influence it in some way. For example, at a time ten years before E, if we consider the set of all events in the past light cone of E which occur at that time, the result would be a sphere (2D: disk) with a radius of ten light-years centered on the position where E will occur. So, any point on or inside the sphere could send a signal moving at the speed of light or slower that would have time to influence the event E, while points outside the sphere at that moment would not be able to have any causal influence on E. Likewise, the set of events that lie on or inside the future light cone of E would also be the set of events that could receive a signal sent out from the position and time of E, so the future light cone contains all the events that could potentially be causally influenced by E. Events which lie neither in the past or future light cone of E cannot influence or be influenced by E in relativity. Mathematical construction In special relativity, a light cone (or null cone) is the surface describing the temporal evolution of a flash of light in Minkowski spacetime. This can be visualized in 3-space if the two horizontal axes are chosen to be spatial dimensions, while the vertical axis is time. The light cone is constructed as follows. Taking as event p a flash of light (light pulse) at time t0, all events that can be reached by this pulse from p form the future light cone of p, while those events that can send a light pulse to p form the past light cone of p. Given an event E, the light cone classifies all events in spacetime into 5 distinct categories: * Events on the future light cone of E. * Events on the past light cone of E. * Events inside the future light cone of E are those affected by a material particle emitted at E. * Events inside the past light cone of E are those that can emit a material particle and affect what is happening at E. * All other events are in the (absolute) elsewhere of E and are those that cannot affect or be affected by E. The above classifications hold true in any frame of reference; that is, an event judged to be in the light cone by one observer, will also be judged to be in the same light cone by all other observers, no matter their frame of reference. This is why the concept is so powerful. The above refers to an event occurring at a specific location and at a specific time. To say that one event cannot affect another means that light cannot get from the location of one to the other in a given amount of time. Light from each event will ultimately make it to the former location of the other, but after those events have occurred. As time progresses, the future light cone of a given event will eventually grow to encompass more and more locations (in other words, the 3D sphere that represents the cross-section of the 4D light cone at a particular moment in time becomes larger at later times). However, if we imagine running time backwards from a given event, the event's past light cone would likewise encompass more and more locations at earlier and earlier times. The farther locations will be at later times: for example, if we are considering the past light cone of an event which takes place on Earth today, a star 10,000 light years away would only be inside the past light cone at times 10,000 years or more in the past. The past light cone of an event on present-day Earth, at its very edges, includes very distant objects (every object in the observable universe), but only as they looked long ago, when the Universe was young. Two events at different locations, at the same time (according to a specific frame of reference), are always outside each other's past and future light cones; light cannot travel instantaneously. Other observers might see the events happening at different times and at different locations, but one way or another, the two events will likewise be seen to be outside each other's cones. If using a system of units where the speed of light in vacuum is defined as exactly 1, for example if space is measured in light-seconds and time is measured in seconds, then, provided the time axis is drawn orthogonally to the spatial axes, as the cone bisects the time and space axes, it will show a slope of 45°, because light travels a distance of one light- second in vacuum during one second. Since special relativity requires the speed of light to be equal in every inertial frame, all observers must arrive at the same angle of 45° for their light cones. Commonly a Minkowski diagram is used to illustrate this property of Lorentz transformations. Elsewhere, an integral part of light cones is the region of spacetime outside the light cone at a given event (a point in spacetime). Events that are elsewhere from each other are mutually unobservable, and cannot be causally connected. (The 45° figure really only has meaning in space-space, as we try to understand space- time by making space-space drawings. Space-space tilt is measured by angles, and calculated with trig functions. Space-time tilt is measured by rapidity, and calculated with hyperbolic functions.) In general relativity Light cones near a black hole resulting from a collapsing star. The purple (dashed) line shows the path of a photon emitted from the surface of a collapsing star. The green (dot-dash) line shows the path of another photon shining at the singularity. In flat spacetime, the future light cone of an event is the boundary of its causal future and its past light cone is the boundary of its causal past. In a curved spacetime, assuming spacetime is globally hyperbolic, it is still true that the future light cone of an event includes the boundary of its causal future (and similarly for the past). However gravitational lensing can cause part of the light cone to fold in on itself, in such a way that part of the cone is strictly inside the causal future (or past), and not on the boundary. Light cones also cannot all be tilted so that they are 'parallel'; this reflects the fact that the spacetime is curved and is essentially different from Minkowski space. In vacuum regions (those points of spacetime free of matter), this inability to tilt all the light cones so that they are all parallel is reflected in the non-vanishing of the Weyl tensor.

The United States attributes the worsening of relations to the 1979–81 Iran hostage crisis, Iran's repeated human rights abuses since the Islamic Revolution, and its growing influence in the Middle East. Since 1995, the United States has had an embargo on trade with Iran. In 2015 the United States led successful negotiations for a nuclear deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) intended to dismantle Iran's nuclear weapons capabilities, and when Iran complied in 2016, sanctions on Iran were lifted.Akbar E.

Since this time, relations between the United States and Iran have worsened, and the two countries came close to conflict during the 2019–20 Persian Gulf crisis. According to a 2013 BBC World Service poll, 5% of Americans view Iranian influence positively, with 87% expressing a negative view, the most unfavorable perception of Iran in the world. On the other hand, research has shown that most Iranians hold a positive attitude about the American people, though not the US government.Shahghasemi, E., Heisey, D. R., & Mirani, G. (October 1, 2011). \\"How do Iranians and U.S. Citizens perceive each other: A systematic review.\\" Journal of Intercultural Communication, 27.Shahghasemi, E., & Heisey, D. R. (January 1, 2009). \\"The Cross-Cultural Schemata of Iranian-American People Toward Each Other: A Qualitative Approach.\\" Intercultural Communication Studies, 18, 1, 143–160. According to a 2019 survey by IranPoll, 13% of Iranians have a favorable view of the United States, with 86% expressing an unfavorable view. According to a 2018 Pew poll, 39% of Americans say that limiting the power and influence of Iran should be a top foreign policy priority. Relations tend to improve when the two countries have overlapping goals, such as repelling Sunni militants during the Iraq War and the intervention against ISIS.The Middle East and North Africa 2003, eur, 363, 2002 Country comparison { - ! !

Lesch, 2003, , p. 52 In 1883, Samuel G. W. Benjamin was appointed by the United States as the first official diplomatic envoy to Iran; however, ambassadorial relations were not established until 1944. The first Iranian Ambassador to the United States of America was Mirza Albohassan Khan Ilchi Kabir. Justin Perkins and Asahel Grant were the first missionaries dispatched to Iran in 1834 via the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. The US had little interest in Persian affairs, while US as a trustworthy outsider did not suffer. The Persians again sought the US for help in straightening out its finances after World War I. This mission unlike the last was opposed by powerful vested interests and eventually it was withdrawn with its task incomplete. Following this there was no special US concern with Iran or any interaction until World War II. Amir Kabir, Prime Minister under Nasereddin Shah, also initiated direct contacts with the American government in Washington. By the end of the 19th century, negotiations were underway for an American company to establish a railway system from the Persian Gulf to Tehran. Until World War II, relations between Iran and the United States remained cordial. As a result, many Iranians sympathetic to the Persian Constitutional Revolution came to view the US as a \\"third force\\" in their struggle to break free of British and Russian dominance in Persian affairs. American industrial and business leaders were supportive of Iran's drive to modernize its economy and free itself from British and Russian influence.

File:Tabriz memorial highschool 00.jpgAmerican Memorial School in Tabriz, established in 1881 During the Persian Constitutional Revolution in 1909, an American named Howard Baskerville died in Tabriz while fighting with a militia in a battle against royalist forces. After the Iranian parliament appointed United States financier Morgan Shuster as Treasurer General of Iran in 1911, an American was killed in Tehran by henchmen thought to be affiliated with Russian or British interests. Shuster became even more active in supporting the Constitutional revolution of Iran financially.Ibid. p. 83 When Iran's government ordered Shu'a al-Saltaneh (شعاع السلطنه), the Shah's brother who was aligned with the goals of Imperial Russia in Iran, to surrender his assets, Shuster moved to execute the seizure. Imperial Russia immediately landed troops in Bandar Anzali, demanding a recourse and apology from the Persian government. Russia's General Liakhov subsequently shelled Iran's parliament in Tehran as part of actions to protect Russia's interests during the chain of events, and Morgan Shuster was forced to resign under British and Russian pressure. Shuster's book The Strangling of Persia is a recount of the details of these events and is critical of Britain and Imperial Russia. The American Embassy first reported to the Iran desk at the Foreign Office in London about the popular view of Britain's involvement in the 1921 coup that brought Reza Shah to power.Zirinsky M.P.

Modern Iran since 1921. Longman. 2003 pp. 26–31 A British Embassy report from 1932 admits that the British put Reza Shah \\"on the throne\\". At that time, Iran did not view the United States as an ally of Britain. In 1936, Iran withdrew its ambassador in Washington after the publication of an article criticizing Reza Shah in the New York Daily Herald. The withdrawal lasted for nearly one year. Morgan Shuster was soon followed by Arthur Millspaugh, who was appointed Treasurer General by Reza Shah, and Arthur Pope, who was a main driving force behind the Persian Empire revivalist policies of Reza Shah. The friendly relations between the United States and Iran lasted until the 1950s.  Reign of the last Shah of Iran  File:Shah & Harry Truman.jpgThe Shah with Harry S. Truman in 1949 File:ShahEisenhower.jpgThe Shah with Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959 File:Kennedy with Shah of Iran, 1961.jpgThe Shah with John F. Kennedy and Robert McNamara in 1962 File:The Shah of Iran and President Nixon - NARA - 194301.jpgThe Shah with Richard Nixon in 1969 In 1941 the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran deposed Reza Shah believed to be Axis-leaning and established a supply route of war material to the Soviet Union. From 1942 US troops were involved in the operation of this Persian Corridor one of the routes through which the US delivered Lend-Lease supplies to the USSR. The last Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, maintained close ties with the United States during most of his reign, which lasted from 1941 until he was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution in 1979. He pursued a modernizing economic policy, and a strongly pro-American foreign policy; he also made a number of visits to America, where he was regarded as a friend. Iran's long border with America's Cold War rival, the Soviet Union, and its position as the largest, most powerful country in the oil-rich Persian Gulf, made Iran a \\"pillar\\" of US foreign policy in the Middle East.Twin Pillars to Desert Storm : America's Flawed Vision in the Middle East from Nixon to Bush by Howard Teicher ; Gayle Radley Radley, Harpercollins, 1993 Prior to the Iranian Revolution of 1979, many Iranian students and other citizens resided in the United States, and had a positive and welcoming attitude towards America and Americans. In the 1970s, approximately 25,000 American technicians were deployed to Iran in order to maintain military equipment (such as F-14s) that had been sold to the Shah's government. Additionally, from 1950 to 1979, an estimated 800,000 to 850,000 Americans had visited or lived in Iran, and had often expressed their admiration for the Iranian people.  Prime Minister Mossadeq and his overthrow  In 1953, the government of prime minister Mohammed Mossadeq was overthrown in a coup organized by the British and American governments. Many Iranians argue that the coup and the subsequent U.S. support for the shah proved largely responsible for the shah's arbitrary rule, which led to the \\"deeply anti-American character\\" of the 1979 revolution.Gasiorowski, writing in Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, p. 261 Until the outbreak of World War II, the United States had no active policy toward Iran.Kinzer, Stephen, All the Shah's Men: An American Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror, Stephen Kinzer, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, p. 86 When the Cold War began, the United States was alarmed by the attempt by the Soviet Union to set up separatist states in Iranian Azerbaijan and Kurdistan, as well as its demand for military rights to the Dardanelles in 1946. This fear was enhanced by the loss of China to communism, the uncovering of Soviet spy rings, and the start of the Korean War.Byrne writing in Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, pp. 201, 204–06, 212, 219. In 1952 and 1953, the Abadan Crisis took place when Iranian prime minister Mohammed Mossadeq began nationalization of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). Established by the British in the early 20th century, the company shared profits (85% for Britain, and 15% for Iran), but the company withheld their financial records from the Iranian government. By 1951, Iranians supported nationalization of the AIOC, and Parliament unanimously agreed to nationalize its holding of, what was at the time, the British Empire's largest company. The British retaliated with an embargo on Iranian oil, which was supported by international oil companies. Over the following months, negotiations over control and compensation for the oil were deadlocked, and Iran's economy deteriorated. U.S. President Harry S. Truman pressed Britain to moderate its position in the negotiations and to not invade Iran. American policies created a feeling in Iran that the United States was on Mossadeq's side and optimism that the oil dispute would soon be settled with \\"a series of innovative proposals to settle\\" the dispute, giving Iran \\"significant amounts of economic aid\\". Mossadeq visited Washington, and the American government made \\"frequent statements expressing support for him.\\"Gasiorowski writing in Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, p. 273 At the same time, the United States honored the British embargo and, without Truman's knowledge, the Central Intelligence Agency station in Tehran had been \\"carrying out covert activities\\" against Mosaddeq and the National Front \\"at least since the summer of 1952\\".Gasiorowski writing in Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, p. 243  1953 Iranian coup d'état  As the Cold War intensified, oil negotiations stalled, and the Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower replaced Democratic President Harry S. Truman, the United States helped destabilize Mosaddeq on the theory that \\"rising internal tensions and continued economic deterioration...might lead to a breakdown of government authority and open the way for at least a gradual assumption of control\\" by Iran's well organized Tudeh communist party.Gasiorowski writing in Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, pp. 230–31 In spring and summer 1953, the United States and Britain, through a covert operation of the CIA called Operation Ajax, conducted from the American Embassy in Tehran, helped organize a coup d'état to overthrow the Mossadeq government. The operation initially failed, and the Shah fled to Italy, but a second attempt succeeded, and Mosaddeq was imprisoned. According to a study of the coup headed by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, intended \\"to resolve\\" the \\"controversy\\" over who and what were responsible, \\"it was geostrategic considerations, rather than a desire to destroy Mosaddeq's movement, to establish a dictatorship in Iran or to gain control over Iran's oil, that persuaded U.S. officials to undertake the coup.\\"Gasiorowski writing in Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, p. 274  Post-coup  President Lyndon Johnson welcoming the Shah at the White House while Iranians protest, 1967 Following the coup, the United States helped re-install the Shah. In the first three weeks, the U.S. government gave Iran $68 million in emergency aid, and an additional $1.2 billion over the next decade.Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004, p. 257 In this era that ensued, until the fall of the shah in 1979, Iran was one of the United States' closest allies. The US also played a critical role in founding the Shah's brutal secret police to keep him in power. A US Army colonel working for the CIA was sent to Persia in September 1953 to guide local personnel in creating the organizationM. J. Gasiorowski, eds., Neither East Nor West.

The Shah's close ties to Washington and his Modernization policies soon angered some Iranians, especially the hardcore Islamic conservatives.Citation Needed In America, the coup was originally considered a triumph of covert action but later on came to be considered by many to have left \\"a haunting and terrible legacy.\\"Kinzer, 2003, p. 215 In 2000, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, called it a \\"setback for democratic government\\" in Iran.\\"U.S. Comes Clean About The Coup In Iran\\", CNN, 04-19-2000.

Nuclear support  The U.S. helped Iran create its nuclear program starting in 1957 by providing Iran its first nuclear reactor and nuclear fuel, and after 1967 by providing Iran with weapons grade enriched uranium.NPR, 18 Sept. 2015, \\"Born In The USA: How America Created Iran's Nuclear Program,\\" https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/09/18/440567960/born-in-the-u-s-a- how-america-created-irans-nuclear-program Iran's nuclear program was launched in the 1950s with the help of the United States as part of the Atoms for Peace program. The participation of the United States and Western European governments in Iran's nuclear program continued until the 1979 Iranian Revolution that toppled the last Shah of Iran. The United States reached a deal in 2015 to limit Iran's nuclear capabilities. Sanctions relief under the terms of the deal freed over 100 billion dollars in frozen assets overseas for Iran and increased foreign access to the Iranian economy. In return, Iran had to temporarily agree not to engage in activities, including research and development of a nuclear bomb. The United States withdrew from the deal in 2018.  Cultural relations  Relations in the cultural sphere remained cordial. Pahlavi University, Sharif University of Technology, and Isfahan University of Technology, three of Iran's top academic universities were all directly modeled on American institutions, such as the University of Chicago, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania.Exporting MIT. Stuart W. Leslie and Robert Kargon. Osiris, vol. 21 (2006), pp. 110–30 The Shah was generous in awarding American universities with financial gifts. For example, the University of Southern California received an endowed chair of petroleum engineering, and a million dollar donation was given to the George Washington University to create an Iranian Studies program.  Growth of oil revenues  In the 1960s and 1970s, Iran's oil revenues grew considerably. Starting in the mid-1960s, this \\"weakened U.S. influence in Iranian politics\\" while strengthening the power of the Iranian state vis-a-vis the Iranian public. According to scholar Homa Katouzian, this put the United States \\"in the contradictory position of being regarded\\" by the Iranian public because of the 1953 coup \\"as the chief architect and instructor of the regime,\\" while \\"its real influence\\" in domestic Iranian politics and policies \\"declined considerably\\".Katouzian writing in Mohammad Mosaddeq and the 1953 Coup in Iran, Edited by Mark J. Gasiorowski and Malcolm Byrne, Syracuse University Press, 2004 p. 23 With the oil revenue growing excessively the United States and Iran's relationship grew stronger and more stable. James Bill and other historians have said that between 1969 and 1974 U.S. President Richard Nixon actively recruited the Shah as an American puppet and proxy.James A. Bill, The eagle and the lion: The tragedy of American-Iranian relations (1989). However, Richard Alvandi argues that it worked the other way around, with the Shah taking the initiative. President Nixon, who had first met the Shah in 1953, regarded him as a modernizing anticommunist statesman who deserved American support now that the British were withdrawing from the region. They met in 1972 and the Shah agreed to buy large quantities of expensive American military hardware and took responsibility for ensuring political stability and fighting off Soviet subversion throughout the region.Roham Alvandi, Nixon, Kissinger, and the Shah: The United States and Iran in the Cold War (2014)  1977–79: Carter administration  The Iranian Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi meeting with Alfred Atherton, William H. Sullivan, Cyrus Vance, President Jimmy Carter, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, 1977 Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, Shah of Iran, shakes hands with a US Air Force general officer prior to his departure from the United States In the late 1970s, American President Jimmy Carter emphasized human rights in his foreign policy, including the Shah's regime, which by 1977 had garnered unfavorable publicity in the international community for its human rights record.Abrahamian, Iran (1982), pp. 498–99. That year, the Shah responded to Carter's \\"polite reminder\\" by granting amnesty to some prisoners and allowing the Red Cross to visit prisons. Through 1977, liberal opposition formed organizations and issued open letters denouncing the Shah's regime.Abrahamian, Iran (1982), pp. 501–03. At the same time, Carter angered anti-Shah Iranians with a New Year's Eve 1978 toast to the Shah in which he said: > Under the Shah's brilliant leadership Iran is an island of stability in one > of the most troublesome regions of the world. There is no other state figure > whom I could appreciate and like more.Geopolitical Aspects of Islamization > hosted by ca-c.org Observers disagree over the nature of United States policy toward Iran under Carter as the Shah's regime crumbled. According to historian Nikki Keddie, the Carter administration followed \\"no clear policy\\" on Iran.Keddie, Modern Iran (2003), p. 235. The American ambassador to Iran, William H. Sullivan, recalled that the US National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski \\"repeatedly assured Pahlavi that the U.S. backed him fully\\". On November 4, 1978, Brzezinski called the Shah to tell him that the United States would \\"back him to the hilt.\\" At the same time, high-level officials in the State Department believed the revolution was unstoppable.Keddie, Modern Iran (2003), pp. 235–36. After visiting the Shah in summer of 1978, Secretary of the Treasury W. Michael Blumenthal complained of the Shah's emotional collapse, reporting, \\"You've got a zombie out there.\\"Shawcross, The Shah's Last Ride (1988), p. 21. Brzezinski and Energy Secretary James Schlesinger were adamant in their assurances that the Shah would receive military support. Another scholar, sociologist Charles Kurzman, argues that, rather than being indecisive or sympathetic to the revolution, the Carter administration was consistently supportive of the Shah and urged the Iranian military to stage a \\"last-resort coup d'etat\\" even after the regime's cause was hopeless.Kurzman, Charles, The Unthinkable Revolution in Iran, Harvard University Press, 2004, p. 157  The 1979 revolution  The 1979 Revolution, which ousted the pro-American Shah and replaced him with the anti-American Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, surprised the United States government, its State Department and intelligence services, which \\"consistently underestimated the magnitude and long-term implications of this unrest\\". Six months before the revolution culminated, the CIA had produced a report, stating that \\"Iran is not in a revolutionary or even a 'prerevolutionary' situation.\\"US House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Iran. Evaluation of U.S. Intelligence Performance Prior to November 1978. Staff Report, Washington, DC, p. 7. Revolutionary students feared the power of the United States—particularly its Central Intelligence Agency to overthrow a new Iranian government. One source of this concern was a book by CIA agent Kermit Roosevelt Jr. titled Countercoup: The Struggle for Control of Iran. Many students had read excerpts from the book and thought that the CIA would attempt to implement this countercoup strategy.Heikal, Iran: The Untold Story (1982), p. 23. \\"It was abundantly clear to me that the students were obsessed with the idea that the Americans might be preparing to mount another counter-coup. Memories of 1953 were uppermost in their minds. They all knew about Kermit Roosevelt's book Countercoup, and most of them had read extracts from it. Although, largely owing to intervention by the British, who were anxious that the part they and the oil company had played in organizing the coup should not become known, this book had been withdrawn before publication, a few copies of it had got out and been duplicated.\\" Khomeini, who referred to America as the \\"Great Satan\\", instantly got rid of the Shah's prime minister and replaced him with a moderate politician called Mehdi Bazargan. Until this point, the Carter Administration was still hoping for normal relationships with Iran, sending its National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. The Islamic revolutionaries wished to extradite and execute the ousted Shah, and Carter refused to give him any further support or help return him to power. The Shah, suffering from terminal cancer, requested entry into the United States for treatment. The American embassy in Tehran opposed the request, as they were intent on stabilizing relations between the new interim revolutionary government of Iran and the United States. However, President Carter agreed to let the Shah in, after severe pressure from Henry Kissinger, Nelson Rockefeller and other pro- Shah political figures. Iranians' suspicion that the Shah was actually trying to conspire against the Iranian Revolution grew; thus, this incident was often used by the Iranian revolutionaries to justify their claims that the former monarch was an American puppet, and this led to the storming of the American embassy by radical students allied with the Khomeini faction.  The hostage crisis  Vice President George H. W. Bush and other VIPs wait to welcome the former hostages to Iran home On 4 November 1979, the revolutionary group Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line, angered that the recently deposed Shah had been allowed into the United States, occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took American diplomats hostage. The 52 American diplomats were held hostage for 444 days. In Iran, the incident was seen by many as a blow against American influence in Iran and the liberal-moderate interim government of Prime Minister Mehdi Bazargan, who opposed the hostage taking, resigned soon after. Some Iranians were concerned that the United States may have been plotting another coup against their country in 1979 from the American embassy. In the United States, the hostage-taking was seen as a violation of a centuries-old principle of international law that granted diplomats immunity from arrest and diplomatic compounds sovereignty in the territory of the host country they occupy.\\"Doing Satan's Work in Iran\\", The New York Times, November 6, 1979 The United States military attempted a rescue operation, Operation Eagle Claw, on April 24, 1980, which resulted in an aborted mission and the deaths of eight American military men. The crisis ended with the signing of the Algiers Accords in Algeria on January 19, 1981. On January 20, 1981, the date the treaty was signed, the hostages were released. The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (located in The Hague, Netherlands) was established for the purpose of handling claims of American nationals against Iran and of Iranian nationals against the United States. American contact with Iran through The Hague covers only legal matters. The crisis led to lasting economic and diplomatic damage. On 7 April 1980, Carter severed diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States and they have been frozen ever since. Since 21 May 1980, Switzerland has been the protecting power for the United States in Iran. Contrary to usual practice, the US Embassy was not given into the charge of the Swiss Embassy. Instead, parts of the embassy complex were turned into an anti-American museum, while other parts became offices for student organizations. Iranian interests in the US were initially represented by the Algerian Embassy. However, Iran later chose Pakistan to be its protecting power in the United States.  Economic consequences of the Iran hostage crisis  Families wait for the former hostages to disembark the plane Before the Revolution, the United States was Iran's foremost economic and military partner. This facilitated the modernization of Iran's infrastructure and industry, with as many as 30,000 American expatriates residing in the country in a technical, consulting, or teaching capacity. Some analysts argue that the transformation may have been too rapid, fueling unrest and discontent among an important part of the population in the country and leading to the Revolution in 1979. After the 1979 seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran, the United States Executive Order 12170 froze about $12 billion in Iranian assets, including bank deposits, gold and other properties. According to American officials, most of those were released in 1981 as part of the Algiers Accords to release the hostages. Some assets—Iranian officials say $10 billion, but US officials say much less—remain frozen, pending resolution of legal claims arising from the Revolution. Commercial relations between Iran and the United States are restricted by American sanctions and consist mainly of Iranian purchases of food, spare parts, and medical products as well as American purchases of carpets and food. Sanctions originally imposed in 1995 by President Bill Clinton were renewed by President Bush, who cited the \\"unusual and extraordinary threat\\" to American national security posed by Iran. The 1995 executive orders prohibit American companies and their foreign subsidiaries from conducting business with Iran, while banning any \\"contract for the financing of the development of petroleum resources located in Iran\\". In addition, the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 (ILSA) imposed mandatory and discretionary sanctions on non-American companies investing more than $20 million annually in the Iranian oil and natural gas sectors. The ILSA was renewed for five more years in 2001. Congressional bills signed in 2006 extended and added provisions to the act; on September 30, 2006, the act was renamed the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA), as it no longer applied to Libya, and extended several times. On December 1, 2016, ISA was extended for a further ten years.  1981–1989: Reagan administration   Iran–Iraq War  American intelligence and logistical support played a crucial role in arming Iraq in the Iran–Iraq War, although Bob Woodward states that the United States gave information to both sides, hoping \\"to engineer a stalemate\\". In search for a new set or order in this region, the US government adopted a policy designed to contain both Iran and Iraq economically and militarily in favor of the US's national interest. During the second half of the Iran–Iraq War, the Reagan Administration pursued several sanction bills against Iran; on the other hand, it established full diplomatic relations with Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist government in Iraq by removing it from the US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism in 1984. According to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, the administrations of Presidents Reagan and George H. W. Bush authorized the sale to Iraq of numerous dual-use items, including poisonous chemicals and deadly biological viruses, such as anthrax and bubonic plague. The Iran–Iraq War ended with both agreeing to a ceasefire in 1988. In 2000, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright expressed regret for that support.Albright's speech on Iran-U.S. relations , Reuters, Alexander's Gas and Oil Connection, 17 March 2000.  1983: Hezbollah bombings  The United States contends that Hezbollah, a Shi'ite Islamist organization and client of Iran, has been involved in several anti-American terrorist attacks, including the April 1983 United States Embassy bombing which killed 17 Americans, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing which killed 241 US soldiers in Lebanon, and the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing.

Iran-Contra Affair  In violation of an arms embargo, officials of President Ronald Reagan's administration arranged in the mid-1980s to sell armaments to Iran in an attempt to improve relations with Iran and obtain their influence in the release of hostages held in Lebanon. Oliver North of the National Security Council then diverted proceeds from the arms sale to fund Contra rebels attempting to overthrow the left wing government of Nicaragua, which was in direct violation of the United States Congress' Boland Amendment. In November 1986, Reagan issued a televised statement that the arms sales did not occur. One week later, he confirmed that weapons had been transferred to Iran, but denied that they were part of an exchange for hostages. Later investigations by Congress and an independent counsel disclosed details of both operations and noted that documents relating to the affair were destroyed or withheld from investigators by Reagan administration officials.  United States attack of 1988  In 1988, the United States launched Operation Praying Mantis against Iran, claiming that it was retaliation for the Iranian mining of areas of the Persian Gulf as part of the Iran–Iraq War. The American attack was the largest American naval combat operation since World War II.Love, Robert William. History of the U.S. Navy. Harrisburg: Stackpole Books, 1992. p. 787 American action began with coordinated strikes by two surface groups that neutralized the Sassan oil platform and the Sirri oil platform of Iran. Iran lost one major warship and a smaller gunboat. Damage to the oil platforms was eventually repaired. Iran sued for reparations at the International Court of Justice, stating that the United States breached the 1955 Treaty of Amity. The court dismissed the claim but noted that \\"the actions of the United States of America against Iranian oil platforms on October 19, 1987 (Operation Nimble Archer) and April 18, 1988 (Operation Praying Mantis) cannot be justified as measures necessary to protect the essential security interests of the United States of America.\\"International Court of Justice.

Slate. July 23, 2014. The attack killed 290 civilians from six nations, including 66 children. USS Vincennes was in the Persian Gulf as part of Operation Earnest Will. The United States initially contended that flight 655 was a warplane and then said that it was outside the civilian air corridor and did not respond to radio calls. Both statements were untrue, and the radio calls were made on military frequencies to which the airliner did not have access. According to the Iranian government, the attack was an intentional and unlawful act. Iran refused to accept the idea of mistaken identification, arguing that this constituted gross negligence and recklessness amounting to an international crime, because the aircraft was not on a trajectory that threatened the Vincennes and had not aimed radar at it.Aerial Incident of 3 July 1988 (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

Lustig, the air-warfare coordinator, received the Navy Commendation Medal, often given for acts of heroism or meritorious service, but a not-uncommon end-of-tour medal for a second tour division officer. According to the History Channel, the medal citation noted his ability to \\"quickly and precisely complete the firing procedure.\\" History.com However, in 1990, The Washington Post listed Lustig's awards as one being for his entire tour from 1984 to 1988 and the other for his actions relating to the surface engagement with Iranian gunboats. In 1990, Rogers was awarded the Legion of Merit \\"for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding service as commanding officer ... from April 1987 to May 1989.\\" The award was given for his service as the Commanding Officer of the Vincennes, and the citation made no mention of the downing of Iran Air 655.  1989–1993: Bush administration  Newly elected U.S. president George H. W. Bush announced a \\"goodwill begets goodwill\\" gesture in his inaugural speech on 20 January 1989. The Bush administration urged Rafsanjani to use Iran's clout in Lebanon to obtain the release of the remaining US hostages held by Hezbollah. Bush indicated there would be a reciprocal gesture toward Iran by the United States. Bush's national security advisor Brent Scowcroft said in late 1991 it might be possible to take Iran off the terrorist list, reduce economic sanctions, and further compensate Iranians for the shooting down of an Iranian civilian Airbus jet with a missile launched by a United States ship in July 1988, by mistake. However, the Bush administration did not respond to Iran's gesture, even after the last hostage, reporter Terry Anderson, was finally released in December 1991.  1993–2001: Clinton administration  In April 1995, a total embargo on dealings with Iran by American companies was imposed by President Bill Clinton. This ended trade, which had been growing following the end of the Iran–Iraq War.Keddie, Modern Iran (2003), p. 265 The next year, the American Congress passed the Iran-Libya Sanctions act, designed to prevent other countries from making large investments in Iranian energy. The act was denounced by the European Union as invalid, but it blocked some investment for Iran.  Khatami and Iranian reformers  In January 1998, newly elected Iranian President Mohammad Khatami called for a \\"dialogue of civilizations\\" with the United States in a CNN interview. In the interview, Khatami invoked Alexis de Tocqueville's Democracy in America to explain the similarities between American and Iranian quests for freedom. American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright responded positively, and the countries exchanged wrestling teams. This also brought free travel between the countries as well as an end to the American embargo of Iranian carpets and pistachios. Relations then stalled due to opposition from Iranian conservatives and American preconditions for discussions, including changes in Iranian policy on Israel, nuclear energy, and support for terrorism.Keddie, Modern Iran, (2003) p. 272  Inter-Parliamentary (Congress-to-Majlis) informal talks  On August 31, 2000, four United States Congress members, Senator Arlen Specter, Representative Bob Ney, Representative Gary Ackerman, and Representative Eliot L. Engel held informal talks in New York City with several Iranian leaders. The Iranians included Mehdi Karroubi, speaker of the Majlis of Iran (Iranian Parliament); Maurice Motamed, a Jewish member of the Majlis; and three other Iranian parliamentarians.  2001–05: Bush administration, first term   September 11 attacks  On September 25, 2001, Iran's president Mohammad Khatami meeting British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, said: \\"Iran fully understands the feelings of the Americans about the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September 11.\\" He said although the American administrations had been at best indifferent about terrorist operations in Iran (since 1979), the Iranians instead felt differently and had expressed their sympathetic feelings with bereaved Americans in the tragic incidents in the two cities. He also stated that \\"Nations should not be punished in place of terrorists.\\"P.I.R.I News Headlines (Tue 80/07/03 A.H.S). The Official Site of the Office of the President of Iran.

The speech caused outrage in Iran and was condemned by reformists and conservatives.news.bbc.co.uk Since 2003, the United States has been flying unmanned aerial vehicles, launched from Iraq, over Iran to obtain intelligence on Iran's nuclear program, reportedly providing little new information. The Iranian government has described the surveillance as illegal.  Alleged \\"Grand Bargain\\" proposal  A tractor-trailer from Virginia's Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue Team loaded aboard a C-5 Galaxy heading for Bam, Iran On 4 May 2003, the Swiss government sent the U.S. State Department an unsigned one-page memorandum, which was not on official letterhead, and contained a cover letter by Swiss diplomat Tim Guldimannn which laid out a roadmap for discussions between Iran and the U.S. Under the heading of \\"U.S. aims\\", the document stated that Iran was willing to put \\"the following aims on the agenda\\": Accepting \\"the two-states approach\\" to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, ending \\"material support to Palestinian opposition groups ... from Iranian territory,\\" pressuring Hezbollah \\"to become an exclusively political and social organization within Lebanon,\\" supporting \\"political stabilization and the establishment of democratic institutions\\" in Iraq, taking \\"decisive action against any terrorists (above all al Qaeda) on Iranian territory,\\" and fully cooperating with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to ensure \\"there are no Iranian endeavors to develop or possess WMD.\\" Under the heading of \\"Iran aims\\", the document stated \\"the U.S. accepts a dialogue ... and agrees that Iran puts the following aims on the agenda\\": Ending U.S. efforts to change \\"the political system\\" in Iran, abolishing \\"all sanctions,\\" taking action against the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MKO), recognizing \\"Iran's legitimate security interests in the region,\\" and granting Iran \\"access to peaceful nuclear technology, biotechnology and chemical technology.\\" In the cover letter, Guldimann claimed that he developed the \\"Roadmap\\" with Sadeq Kharrazi, \\"the Iranian ambassador in Paris,\\" and that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei \\"agreed with 85–90% of the paper,\\" although he could not obtain \\"a precise answer on what exactly the Leader explicitly has agreed.\\" The Bush administration did not respond to the proposal, although in March 2004 President Bush sent Mohamed ElBaradei to Tehran with the message that \\"an Iranian representative with the authority to make a deal should go to the U.S. and Bush himself would personally lead\\" negotiations to \\"resolve all the issues between us;\\" according to Hassan Rouhani, the Iranian leadership decided \\"that we should not negotiate with the U.S.,\\" even though \\"the Americans had taken the first step.\\" Nevertheless, in 2007, The New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristoff and others popularized the notion that \\"hard- liners in the Bush administration killed discussion\\" of an Iranian \\"Grand Bargain\\" that \\"could have saved lives in Iraq, isolated Palestinian terrorists and encouraged civil society groups in Iran,\\" with Kristoff concluding: \\"The record indicates that officials from the repressive, duplicitous government of Iran pursued peace more energetically and diplomatically than senior Bush administration officials—which makes me ache for my country.\\" Kristoff claimed \\"Iran also sent its own master text of the proposal to the State Department and, through an intermediary, to the White House.\\" However, available evidence casts doubt on the genuineness of this proposal, which may have merely been an invention of Guldimann, who sought to promote U.S.–Iran rapprochement. For example, Michael Rubin noted that \\"Guldimann told different people different things about the document's origin,\\" while \\"the Swiss Foreign Ministry refused to back up Guldimann's account.\\" Iranian and U.S. officials were engaged in a series of secret, high-level negotiations during 2003, and Iran's UN ambassador Mohammad Javad Zarif had met with U.S. diplomat Zalmay Khalilzad on May 3–one day prior to the State Department receiving the alleged \\"Grand Bargain.\\" Glenn Kessler asked \\"If Iran was serious, why would such an important diplomatic undertaking be transmitted in such a haphazard way through the Swiss ambassador when one of the supposed co-authors was already holding senior-level talks with U.S. officials?\\" Similarly, Rubin declared: \\"Guldimann's ignorance of these ongoing discussions exposed his fraud.\\" Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage recounted that U.S. officials \\"couldn't determine what was the Iranians' and what was the Swiss ambassador's\\" and \\"nothing that we were seeing in this fax was in consonance with what we were hearing face to face,\\" former National Security Adviser Stephen J. Hadley called the \\"Grand Bargain\\" \\"the result of freelancing by a Swiss diplomat hoping to be the one to make peace between Iran and the United States,\\" and a State Department spokesman described the document as \\"a creative exercise on the part of the Swiss ambassador.\\" In a 30 March 2006 email to Trita Parsi, Zarif confessed: \\"The claims and counter claims about the source of the proposals and motivations of intermediaries remain a mystery for me.

Iran's nuclear program  Since 2003, the United States had alleged that Iran had a program to develop nuclear weapons. Iran maintained that its nuclear program was aimed only at generating electricity. The United States' position was that \\"a nuclear-armed Iran is not acceptable\\",Blair's Next War, May 4, 2005, Dave Wearing but officials have denied that the United States is preparing for an imminent strike. The United Kingdom (UK), France and Germany have also attempted to negotiate a cessation of nuclear enrichment activities by Iran. In June 2005, Condoleezza Rice said that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Mohamed ElBaradei should either \\"toughen his stance on Iran\\" or not be chosen for a third term as IAEA head. Both the United States and Iran are parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The United States and other countries were alleged during the May 2005 NPT meeting to be in violation of the NPT through Article VI, which requires them to disarm. The IAEA has stated that Iran is in violation of a Safeguards Agreement related to the NPT, due to insufficient reporting of nuclear material, its processing and its use.Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement in the Islamic Republic of Iran: Resolution adopted on 24 September 2005, IAEA Under Article IV, the treaty gives non-nuclear states the right to develop civilian nuclear energy programs. From 2003 to early 2006, tensions mounted between the United States and Iran while IAEA inspections of sensitive nuclear industry sites in Iran continued.

That month, Iran announced willingness, under certain conditions, to improve its relations with the United States despite having passed up the opportunity for direct talks at the Iraq conference in Sharm El-Sheikh on May 3, 2007. The conference had been seen by the Americans as an opportunity to get closer to the Iranians and exchange gestures in a public forum.[Dead link. ... Dar Al Hayat]  US covert operations inside Iran  In March 2006, the Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan (PEJAK), an opposition group closely linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) killed 24 members of the Iranian security forces. The PEJAK is linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is listed by the US State Department as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Dennis Kucinich stated in an April 18, 2006, letter to Bush that PEJAK was supported and coordinated by the United States, since it is based in Iraq, which is under the de facto control of American military forces. In November 2006, journalist Seymour Hersh in The New Yorker supported this claim, stating that the American military and the Israelis are giving the group equipment, training, and targeting information in order to create internal pressures in Iran. On April 3, 2007, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) stated that the United States had supported Jundullah since 2005. The Washington Times has described Jundullah as a militant Islamic organization based in Waziristan, Pakistan, and affiliated with Al-Qaeda that has claimed to kill approximately 400 Iranian soldiers. The United States has escalated its covert operations against Iran, according to current and former military, intelligence, and congressional sources. They state that Bush sought up to $400 million for these military operations, which were described in a secret Presidential Finding and are designed to destabilize Iran's religious leadership. The covert activities involve support of the minority Ahwazi Arab and Baluchi groups and other dissident organizations. United States Special Operations Forces have been conducting cross-border operations from southern Iraq, with Presidential authorization, since 2007. The scale and the scope of the operations in Iran, which involve the CIA and the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), have been significantly expanded in 2008.  Iraqi insurgency  Iran has been accused by the United States of giving weapons and support to the Iraqi insurgency (which includes the terrorist group al-Qaeda). The United States State Department states that weapons are smuggled into Iraq and used to arm Iran's allies among the Shiite militias, including those of the anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and his Mahdi army. Evidence for this is that weapons, including mortars, rockets and munitions bear Iranian markings. US commanders report that these bombs inflicted 30 percent of all American military casualties in Iraq excluding Al Anbar Governorate, where these weapons have not been found. Furthermore, US intelligence has obtained satellite photographs of three training camps for Iraqi insurgents near Iran's capital where they are allegedly trained guerilla tactics, kidnapping and assassination. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell stated in an interview with the Council on Foreign Relations that there was overwhelming evidence that Iran was arming the insurgency in Iraq. During his address to the United States Congress on September 11, 2007, Commanding officer for the United States forces in Iraq, General David Petraeus noted that the multinational forces in Iraq have found that Iran's Quds force has provided training, equipment, funding, and direction to terrorists. \\"When we captured the leaders of these so-called special groups ... and the deputy commander of a Lebanese Hezbollah department that was created to support their efforts in Iraq, we've learned a great deal about how Iran has, in fact, supported these elements and how those elements have carried out violent acts against our forces, Iraqi forces and innocent civilians.\\" In a speech on , Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki said that Iran was supporting attacks against Coalition forces in Iraq. In 2014, the United States and Iran began unofficial limited cooperation in the fight against the terrorist organization Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).  2006 sanctions against Iranian institutions  Pushing for international sanctions against Iran because of its nuclear program, the United States accused Iran of providing logistical and financial support to Shi'a militias in Iraq. Iran denied this claim. The American government imposed sanctions on an Iranian bank on September 8, 2006, barring it from direct or indirect dealings with American financial institutions. The move against Bank Saderat Iran was announced by the undersecretary for treasury, who accused the bank of transferring funds for terrorist groups, including $50,000,000 to Hezbollah. While Iranian financial institutions are barred from directly accessing the American financial system, they are permitted to do so indirectly through banks in other countries. He said the United States government would also persuade European financial institutions not to deal with Iran.  2007 US raids Iran Consulate General  In 2007, US forces raided the Iranian Consulate General located in Erbil, Iraq and arrested five staff members. Sources said that American forces landed their helicopters around the building, broke through the consulate's gate, disarmed the guards, confiscated documents, arrested five staff members, and left for an undisclosed location. People living in the neighborhood were told they could not leave their homes. Three people who left their homes were arrested, and a wife of one of these men confirmed her husband's arrest. Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Kamynin said that the raid was an unacceptable violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The Kurdistan Regional Government also expressed their disapproval. At a hearing in Iraq on January 11, 2007, United States Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Rice that the Bush Administration did not have the authority to send American troops on cross-border raids. Biden said, \\"I believe the present authorization granted the president to use force in Iraq does not cover that, and he does need congressional authority to do that. I just want to set that marker\\".Senators fear Iraq war may spill to Iran, Syria Reuters Jan 11, 2007 Biden sent a follow-up letter to the White House asking for an explanation on the matter. The same day, Iran's foreign ministry sent a letter to Iraq's foreign ministry, asking Iraq to stop the United States from interfering with Iran–Iraq relations. The official said, \\"We expect the Iraqi government to take immediate measures to set the aforesaid individuals free and to condemn the US troopers for the measure. Following up on the case and releasing the arrestees is a responsibility of primarily the Iraqi government and then the local government and officials of the Iraqi Kurdistan\\". On November 9, American forces released two Iranian diplomats after 305 days, as well as seven other Iranian citizens. The officials were captured in the raid, and the others had been picked up in different parts of the country and held for periods ranging from three months to three years. American officials said, \\"The release followed a careful review of individual records to determine if they posed a security threat to Iraq, and if their detention was of continued intelligence value\\". American forces still hold 11 Iranian diplomats and citizens.  2008 naval dispute  In January 2008, American officials accused Iran of harassing and provoking their naval vessels in the Strait of Hormuz, but Iran denied the claim. The United States presented audio and video footage of the incident, which included threats made to the Americans. Iranians have told The Washington Post that the accent in the recording does not sound Iranian. Iran has accused the United States of creating a \\"media fuss\\" and has released its own abridged video recording of the incident, which does not contain threats. There has been significant confusion as to the source of the threatening radio transmissions. According to the newspaper Navy Times, the incident could have been caused by a locally famous heckler known as the \\"Filipino Monkey\\".  Covert action against Iran  In 2008, New Yorker reporter Seymour Hersh detailed American covert action plans against Iran involving the CIA, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and Special Forces. Journalist David Ignatius of The Washington Post asserted that American covert action \\"appears to focus on political action and the collection of intelligence rather than on lethal operations\\". Iranian commentator Ali Eftagh stated that the covert actions are being made public by the American government as a form of psychological warfare. Other events (2007–08) A meeting in Baghdad between Iranian and American diplomats was \\"the first formal direct contact after decades during which neither country has been willing to talk to the other.\\"\\"The revolution strikes back.\\" The Economist.

In January 2009, The New York Times reported that the United States had rejected a 2008 appeal from Israel to attack Iran's main nuclear complex.(January 11, 2009) Report: U.S. rejected Israeli plea to attack Iran CNN  2008 US veto of Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities  In September 2008, The Guardian reported that the US vetoed Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert's plan to bomb Iranian nuclear facilities the previous May.  2009–17: Obama administration  The ministers of foreign affairs of the United States and Iran, John Kerry and Mohammad Javad Zarif, meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland (16 March 2015). Two days after Barack Obama was elected president in November 2008, Ahmadinejad issued the first congratulatory message to a newly elected American president since 1979: \\"Iran welcomes basic and fair changes in U.S. policies and conducts. I hope you will prefer real public interests and justice to the never-ending demands of a selfish minority and seize the opportunity to serve people so that you will be remembered with high esteem\\". In his inaugural speech, President Obama said: > To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and > mutual respect. To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, > or blame their society's ills on the West—know that your people will judge > you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power > through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you > are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are > willing to unclench your fist. Ahmadinejad issued a list of grievances, including the 1953 coup, support for Saddam Hussein in the Iran–Iraq War, and the Iran Air Flight 655 incident. In March 2009, an official delegation of Hollywood actors and filmmakers met with their Iranian counterparts in Tehran as a symbol of United States–Iran relations, but Javad Shamghadri, the Arts Adviser to Ahmadinejad, rejected it and said, \\"Representatives of Iran's film industry should only have an official meeting with representatives of the academy and Hollywood if they apologize for the insults and accusations against the Iranian nation during the past 30 years\\". On 19 March 2009, the beginning of the festival of Nowruz, Obama spoke directly to the Iranian people in a video saying, \\"The United States wants the Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations. You have that right—but it comes with real responsibilities\\". A protest in Tehran on 4 November 2015, against the United States, Israel, and Saudi Arabia  Roxana Saberi and detained diplomats  In April 2009, Iranian-American journalist Roxana Saberi was sentenced to eight years in prison after being convicted of spying for the United States. She was accused of possessing a classified document but denied the charge. After spending four months in prison, she was released in May, and the charge was dropped. On July 9, 2009, the United States released five Iranian diplomats (Mohsen Bagheri, Mahmoud Farhadi, Majid Ghaemi, Majid Dagheri and Abbas Jami), who had been held since January 2007. Some analysts believe this was a part of hostage exchange deal between the countries. The US State Department said the release was not part of a deal with Iran but was necessary under an American-Iraqi security pact.  Iranian presidential elections 2009  On 12 June 2009, Obama said of the Iranian presidential election: \\"We are excited to see what appears to be a robust debate taking place in Iran\\". Ahmadinejad's landslide win, which led to fraud allegations and widespread protests, received little comment from the United States. White House press secretary Robert Gibbs stated, \\"Like the rest of the world, we were impressed by the vigorous debate and enthusiasm that this election generated, particularly among young Iranians. We continue to monitor the entire situation closely, including reports of irregularities\\". Vice President Joe Biden said, \\"It sure looks like the way they're suppressing speech, the way they're suppressing crowds, the way in which people are being treated, that there's some real doubt\\". On 15 June, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly declared that the US was \\"deeply troubled by the reports of violent arrests and possible voting irregularities\\". Detention of US hikers over Iraqi border Three American hikers were arrested on 31 July 2009, in Iran after they crossed into Iranian territory. Reports say the hikers accidentally crossed into Iran while hiking between Halabja and Ahmad Awa in the Kurdish Region of Iraq.  Disappearance of Shahram Amiri  Iranian nuclear scientist Shahram Amiri disappeared in May 2009, and Iran accused the United States of abducting him. On 13 July 2010, the BBC reported that Amiri had taken refuge in the Iranian interests section of Pakistani Embassy in Washington, DC, and sought help to reach Iran. However, after his return to Iran, he was sentenced to ten years in prison and in August 2016 was reported to have been executed for treason.  Drone incidents  On 4 December 2011, an American Lockheed Martin RQ-170 Sentinel UAV operated by the CIA was captured by Iranian forces near the city of Kashmar. Iran claimed the drone was not only flying in sovereign airspace, but was commandeered by its cyber warfare unit and safely brought to the ground. The US initially claimed the drone had malfunctioned and crashed in Iranian airspace, only to later admit the drone was intact anonymously when footage was shown on Iranian television. In November 2012, an Iranian Su-25 fighter jet fired on a similar MQ-1 over international waters. In November 2012, two Iranian Su-25s fired on a US drone over the Persian Gulf. The Su-25s fired at least two bursts of cannon fire, and after the drone began moving away, the Iranian aircraft chased it and did aerial loops around it before breaking off and returning to base. On 12 March 2013, an Iranian F-4 fighter jet began pursuing a US MQ-1 over international waters. The F-4 was warned against coming closer by two US fighter jets, at which point it broke off.  Threats to close Persian Gulf  In late December 2011, Iranian navy chief Admiral Habibollah Sayyari was reported to have said that it would be \\"very easy\\" for Iran to close the Straits of Hormuz. On 3 January 2012 Iran's army chief Ataollah Salehi warned \\"We recommend to the American warship that passed through the Strait of Hormuz and went to Gulf of Oman not to return to the Persian Gulf\\". However, this was later denied by the Defense Minister of Iran. The warship is believed to be the American aircraft carrier which recently vacated the area as Iran conducted a 10-day naval exercise near the Strait of Hormuz. Salehi was also quoted as saying \\"We have no plan to begin any irrational act but we are ready against any threat.\\" The US Navy responded that it will continue with its regularly scheduled deployments, in accordance with international maritime conventions. In 2012, the United States Navy was warned that Iran was preparing suicide attack boats and was building up its naval forces in the Gulf region. At a briefing in Bahrain, Vice Admiral Mark Fox told reporters the US Navy's Fifth Fleet could prevent Iran from blocking the Strait of Hormuz. The actual ability of Iran to close the strait has been questioned by experts, with estimates of the time that Iran would be able to sustain the closure ranging from a few days to over a hundred days.  Attempts at rapprochement  Barack Obama speaking with Hassan Rouhani on 27 September 2013 The visit by Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, viewed in the West as a moderate figure, to New York City to address the United Nations General Assembly in September 2013, shortly after he assumed office, was hailed as progress in the countries′ relationship. His television interviews and public addresses while in the U.S. were seen as an effort to convey the message Iran posed no threat and that he was ready to do business with the West; the Obama administration had in turn made a symbolic gesture by making the first official U.S. acknowledgement of the CIA's role in the ousting of Iran's democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh. However, he rejected US President Barack Obama's request for a meeting with him. On 26 September, Iran and the U.S. held their first substantive high-level meeting since the 1979 revolution at multilateral talks that involved the U.S. secretary of state, John Kerry, and the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, the meeting being chaired by the EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton. The following day, Rouhani and Obama spoke by telephone, the two countries' highest political exchange since 1979.Obama speaks with Iranian President Rouhani NBC News 27 September 2013Obama talks to Rouhani: First direct conversation between American and Iranian presidents in 30 years National Post 27 September 2013 The call led to protests by Iranian conservatives who chanted \\"death to America\\" when Rouhani returned to Tehran. On the 34th anniversary of the embassy siege, tens of thousands of supporters of a more hardline approach to relations gathered at the site of the former US embassy to denounce rapprochement. It was the largest such gathering in recent years. Conversely, a majority of Iranian citizens saw the progression of peace talks with the United States as a sign of hope for a future of an alliance between the two nations. On 28 September 2015, an unplanned and \\"accidental\\" encounter between US President Barack Obama and Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Javad Zarif occurred on the sidelines of a luncheon at the United Nations General Assembly, with the two men reportedly shaking hands. It was the first handshake between a US president and a top Iranian diplomat since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. US Secretary of State John Kerry, who was present, also introduced Obama to two senior Iranian officials also involved in the JCPOA nuclear negotiations. The exchange was originally reported in Iranian media and was said to have lasted \\"less than a minute\\"; it was immediately condemned by conservative Iranian MP Mansour Haghighatpour, a member of the committee on national security and foreign policy, who called for Zarif to publicly apologize.  Iran nuclear deal (JCPOA)  On 14 July 2015, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, or the Iran deal) was agreed upon between Iran and a group of world powers: the P5+1 (the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, France, and China—plus Germany) and the European Union. The Obama administration agreed to lift sanctions on Iran that had devastated their economy for years, in return Iran promised to give up their nuclear capabilities and allow workers from the UN to do facility checks whenever they so please. President Obama urged US Congress to support the nuclear deal reminding politicians that were wary that if the deal fell through, the US would reinstate their sanctions on Iran.Mehta, S. (2015). \\"P5+1 – Iran Nuclear Agreement – A Silver Lining in US-Iran Relations.\\" Seton Hall Journal of Diplomacy and International Relations, Vol. 16, Iss. 2. American and Iranian foreign affairs ministers shaking hands at the end of successful negotiations about future of Iran nuclear program, Vienna Following the deal, the U.S. supported a UN Security Council resolution that endorsed the JCPOA—the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 of 20 July 2015. The resolution welcomed \\"Iran's reaffirmation in the JCPOA that it will under no circumstances ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons\\". In 2015, The Washington Post claimed that 2 to 1 Americans supported the United States efforts to negotiate with Iran on behalf of their nuclear capabilities. The Washington Post also stated that 59% of Americans favored the lift of sanctions on Iran's economics in return for the power to regulate Iran's nuclear arms. A polling group called YouGov also did a survey before President Trump took office and found that in approximately 44% of Americans thought that the President should honor international agreements signed by past presidents. The Polling Report has reaffirmed the positive polling numbers from using sources ranging from CNN polls to ABC polls and found that the majority of America was in support of the Iran Nuclear Deal in 2015. By 2016 Gallup News reported that the overall public opinion of the US–Iran nuclear deal was at 30% approval and the disapproval was reported to be at 57%, and 14% had no opinion on the deal. Finally, the latest polls show that in October 2017, Lobe Log (polling firm) found that about 45% of Americans were opposed to the Iran nuclear deal. The approval polls found that only 30% of Americans supported the Iran nuclear deal, staying consistent within the last year.  US Supreme Court decision about frozen Iranian assets  In April 2016, US Supreme Court ruled Iran must pay almost $2bn to victims of 1983 Beirut barracks bombings. In response, Iranian parliament voted a bill that would obligate the government to claim compensation from the United States for its hostile actions against Iran (including 1953 Iranian coup d'état and United States support for Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war). Under the rules of combat, US troops have no clear legal right to sue. But the judge ruled that the troops were on a peacekeeping mission under peacetime rules of engagement. Therefore, survivors and family members could sue Iran under a 1996 law that allows US citizens to take legal action against nations that sponsor terrorism.  2017–present: Trump administration  38th anniversary of the 1979 Revolution in Azadi square, Tehran, 2017 Citizens of Iran and several other countries were temporarily banned from entering the United States by the executive order \\"Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States\\" of 27 January 2017. The United States also does not allow Iranian citizens or those suspected of being Iranian citizens entry into the US, including Iranian passport holders, except for transit. All passengers and crew members of any nationality should ensure they do not have Iranian entry stamps in their passports. There are no direct flights between Iran and the USA so all travel must transit through a third country, and no Iranian aircraft may enter USA airspace. The Trump administration was seen as having embarked on the path of strengthening an informal coalition with Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and other Sunni Gulf states, with a view to rolling back Iran's influence in the region. While during his campaign Donald Trump had denounced the JCPOA as \\"the worst deal ever negotiated\\" and a disaster that could lead to a nuclear holocaust, in April 2017, the Trump administration certified that Iran was in compliance with the JCPOA. Between January and late July 2017, Twitter had identified and shut down over 7,000 accounts created by Iranian influence operations. recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel, Tehran, 11 December 2017 In July 2017, the vast majority of Congressional Democrats and Republicans voted in favor of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) that grouped together sanctions against Iran, Russia and North Korea.\\"Senate overwhelmingly passes new Russia and Iran sanctions\\". The Washington Post. 15 June 2017. On 2 August 2017, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi stated that, \\"In our view the nuclear deal has been violated\\". In September 2017, speaking to the UN General Assembly, the countries′ presidents exchanged offensive remarks and expressed opposing views on the JCPOA.Iran's leader Hassan Rouhani slams Donald Trump in UN speech BBC, 20 September 2017. In May 2018, Donald Trump decided to pull out of the JCPOA, announcing he would reimpose economic sanctions on Iran effective from 4 November that year. In response, the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said that if needed he would \\"begin our industrial enrichment without any limitations\\". On 5 July, Iran threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz if U.S. decided to re-impose oil sanctions on Iran following US withdrawal from the JCPOA. In late July 2018, against the backdrop of a harsh exchange of threats between the presidents of the U.S. and Iran, a large tanker flying a Saudi flag and transporting some 2 million barrels of oil to Egypt was struck in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait near the port of Hodeida by the Houthi rebels in Yemen, believed to be armed and financed by Iran. The incident, which made Saudi Arabia halt oil shipments through the strait, was seen by analysts as greatly escalating tensions.Analysis Mysterious Attack on Saudi Oil Tanker Heats Up U.S.-Iranian Front haaretz.com, 30 July 2018.Iran’s Yemeni Proxies Put Oil Shipments in Crosshairs: A Houthi attack on two Saudi oil tankers near Yemen could be an Iranian bid to hammer a key energy choke point. foreignpolicy.com, 26 July 2018. It was reported that the Trump administration was conducting a program to foment various opposition groups in Iran. On 13 August 2018, Iranian Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned direct talks with U.S., referring to the failure of the previous ones. \\"There will be no war, nor will we negotiate with the US\\" and \\"Even if we ever—impossible as it is—negotiated with the US, it would never ever be with the current US administration,\\" Khamenei said. He added that the United States never budges on the primary goal they pursue in negotiations, which are normally based on give and take, and \\"reneges on its own end of the bargain\\" after the negotiation. In November 2018, all the sanctions removed in 2015 were re-imposed on Iran by the Trump administration. On 7 March 2019, Acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Jonathan Cohen, in a letter to Secretary-General António Guterres, urged the United Nations to put new sanctions on Iran for its new missile activities.  IRGC and U.S. Armed Forces terrorist designations  The United States has opposed the activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) based on \\"the group's growing involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as its support for extremists throughout the Middle East\\". On 8 April 2019, the US Department of State announced its intent to brand the IRGC a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO), effective April 15. The Iranian parliament responded by ratifying a motion designating \\"all legal and real persons and troops of the United States and its allies operating in the West Asian region\\" terrorists, calling any aid to them a terrorist act and pressing the government to defuse the threat of IRGC designation through multilateral negotiations with international organizations. The nonbinding resolution cited \\"the terrorist nature of the United States regime, particularly that part of the American military and security forces and the US Central Command which have been carrying out acts of terrorism in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Iran in the past quarter- century, and have given overt support to terrorist plans.\\" Soon after, the Supreme National Security Council cited similar concerns in declaring the IRGC designation dangerous and illegal, the United States a \\"terrorist government\\" and CENTCOM its primary \\"terrorist organization\\". The IRGC was placed on the FTO list for instigating and supporting insurgencies in Iraq resulting the death of American soldiers. It allegedly operates through its Quds force in other countries in the region and in conjunction with other terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. The US State Department Special Briefing also warned against increasing involvement of the IRGC forces in the Syrian conflict: On 10 April, Hassan Nasrallah, Secretary General of Hezbollah, addressed the designation in a televised speech from Beirut: Michael Rubin, a senior research fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, said he feared the IRGC designation \\"might exculpate the rest of the regime when, in reality, the IRGC's activities cannot be separated from the state leadership of Supreme Leader Khamenei or President Ahmadinejad\\". The Iranian newspaper Kayhan quoted the commander of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards as threatening to deal heavier blows against the United States in response to the designation. Mohammad Khatami, former Reforms Front Iranian President hoped to \\"remind those in the U.S. Congress or elsewhere working for the benefit of the American nation to stand against these measures or the wall between the two countries grow taller and thicker\\". This would be the first time that official armed units of sovereign states are included in a list of banned terrorist groups. Kaveh L. Afrasiabi, a former consultant to the UN's program of Dialogue Among Civilizations, stated in Asia Times Online that the move has possible legal implications: \\"Under international law, it could be challenged as illegal, and untenable, by isolating a branch of the Iranian government for selective targeting. This is contrary to the 1981 Algiers Accords' pledge of non-interference in Iran's internal affairs by the US government\\". News leaks about the prospective designation worried European governments and private sector firms, which could face prosecution in American courts for working with the IRGC. In April 2019 the U.S. threatened to sanction countries continuing to buy oil from Iran after an initial six-month waiver announced in November 2018 expired. According to the BBC, U.S. sanctions against Iran \\"have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests.\\" In December 2018, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani warned: \\"If one day they want to prevent the export of Iran's oil, then no oil will be exported from the Persian Gulf.\\" Also in April 2019, the U.S. designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organization under the State Department's maximum pressure campaign.https://www.npr.org/2019/04/08/710987393/u-s-labels-irans- revolutionary-guard-as-a-foreign-terrorist-organization This designation was done over the opposition of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Department of Defense.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran- revolutionary-guard-corps.htmlhttp://time.com/5566817/iran-terrorist- designation-irgc-trump/https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/mattis-iran-is-the- biggest-threat-to-mideast-peace United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Mick Mulroy stated that this terrorist designation did not grant any additional authorities to the DoD and that they were not seeking any and that the DoD did not believe the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists could be applied to Iran.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump- administration-lays-broad-legal-grounds-for-military-strike-on- iran/2019/07/03/739c3ef8-9d0d-11e9-b27f-ed2942f73d70_story.html  2019–20 escalation in tensions  Tensions between Iran and the United States escalated in May 2019, with the U.S. deploying more military assets to the Persian Gulf region after receiving intelligence reports of an alleged \\"campaign\\" by Iran and its \\"proxies\\" to threaten U.S. forces and Strait of Hormuz oil shipping. American officials pointed to threats against commercial shipping and potential attacks by militias with Iranian ties on American troops in Iraq while also citing intelligence reports that included photographs of missiles on dhows and other small boats in the Persian Gulf, supposedly put there by Iranian paramilitary forces. The United States feared they could be fired at its Navy. On 5 May, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton announced that the U.S. was deploying the Carrier Strike Group and four B-52 bombers to the Middle East to \\"send a clear and unmistakable message\\" to Iran following Israeli intelligence reports of an alleged Iranian plot to attack U.S. forces in the region. Bolton said, \\"The United States is not seeking war with the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond to any attack.\\" The deployed USS Abraham Lincoln is in the Arabian Sea, outside the Persian Gulf. On 7 May, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made a surprise midnight visit to Baghdad after canceling a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Pompeo told Iraqi President Barham Salih and Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi that they had a responsibility to protect Americans in Iraq. On 8 May, an advisor to Ayatollah Khamenei stated Iran was confident the U.S. was both unwilling and unable to start a war with Iran. On the same day, Iran announced that it would reduce its commitment to the JCPOA nuclear deal, which the U.S. pulled out of in May 2018. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani set a 60-day deadline for the EU and world powers to rescue the current deal before it resumed higher uranium enrichment. The United States Air Forces Central Command announced that F-15C Eagle fighter jets were repositioned within the region to \\"defend U.S. forces and interests in the region.\\" On 10 May, the U.S. deployed the Marine transport ship and a Patriot SAM battery to the Middle East. The Pentagon said the buildup was in response to \\"heightened Iranian readiness to conduct offensive operations.\\" On September 10, after the resignation of U.S. national security advisor John Bolton, Iran stated that his resignation will not lead to talks between Washington and Tehran. On September 16, 2019, Iran said that President Hassan Rouhani will not meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the United Nations, unless sanctions on Iran are lifted. In August 2020, U.S. intelligence officials assessed that Iran had offered bounties to the Taliban-linked Haqqani network to kill foreign servicemembers, including Americans, in Afghanistan in 2019. U.S. intelligence determined that Iran paid bounties to Taliban insurgents for the 2019 attack on Bagram airport.  May 2019 Gulf of Oman incident and further rise in tensions  On 12 May, four commercial ships, including two Saudi Aramco oil tankers, were damaged near the port of Fujairah in the Gulf of Oman. The United Arab Emirates claimed the incident was a \\"sabotage attack\\", while a United States assessment reportedly blamed Iran or Iranian \\"proxy\\" elements for the attack. On 13 May, the U.S. embassy in Baghdad said that U.S. citizens should not travel to Iraq and for those who were already there to keep a low profile. On the same day, the New York Times reported that Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan presented a military plan to send as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle East if Iran attacks American forces or makes steps toward developing nuclear weapons. U.S. President Donald Trump later discredited this, saying that he would instead \\"send a hell of a lot more\\" than 120,000 troops if necessary. On 14 May, both Iranian and U.S. officials said they were not seeking war, even as threats and counter-threats continued. Ayatollah Khamenei downplayed the escalation, saying in comments carried on state television that \\"no war is going to happen,\\" while Mike Pompeo said while on a visit to Russia, \\"We fundamentally do not seek a war with Iran.\\" On the same day, Houthi rebels in Yemen carried out multiple drone attacks on a Saudi oil pipeline deep in Saudi territory. The U.S. stated that it believed Iran sponsored the attack, though it was unclear if the attack was particularly related to the Iran-U.S. tensions or related to the Yemeni Civil War that began in 2015 and the Saudi Arabian-led intervention there. On 15 May, the U.S. State Department announced that all non-emergency staff had been ordered to leave the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. On 19 May, U.S. President Trump warned that in the event of a conflict, it would be \\"the official end of Iran.\\" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded that Trump's \\"genocidal taunts\\" won't \\"end Iran\\". On the same day, a rocket exploded inside the heavily fortified Green Zone sector of Baghdad, landing less than a mile from the U.S. Embassy. On 24 May, the U.S. deployed 1,500 additional troops to the Persian Gulf region as a \\"protective\\" measure against Iran. The deployment included reconnaissance aircraft, fighter jets and engineers; 600 of the troops were given extended deployments, meaning 900 would be fresh troops. U.S. Navy vice admiral and Director of the Joint Staff Michael Gilday said the U.S. had a high degree of confidence that Iran's Revolutionary Guard was responsible for the 12 May explosions on four tankers and that it was Iranian proxies in Iraq that fired rockets into Baghdad's Green Zone. On 20 May, President Trump said: \\"We have no indication that anything's happened or will happen\\" in Iran. On 25 May, Trump, declaring that ongoing tensions with Iran amounted to a national emergency, invoked a rarely used legal loophole to approve the sale of $8 billion worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia. Weapons would also reportedly be sold to the UAE and Jordan. On 28 May, the International Atomic Energy Agency certified that Iran was abiding by the main terms of the JCPOA, although questions were raised on how many advanced centrifuges Iran was allowed to have, as that was only loosely defined in the deal. On 1 June, President Hassan Rouhani suggested that Iran would be willing to hold talks but asserted that it would not be pressured by sanctions and American military posturing. On 2 June, Mike Pompeo stated that the U.S. was ready for unconditional discussions with Iran on its nuclear program, but affirmed that it will not relent on pressuring Iran until it starts behaving like a \\"normal country\\". \\"We are prepared to engage in a conversation with no pre-conditions. We are ready to sit down,\\" Pompeo said, while also stating that President Trump had always been willing to seek dialogue with Iranian leadership. Iran's foreign ministry responded stating, \\"The Islamic Republic of Iran does not pay attention to word-play and expression of hidden agenda in new forms. What matters is the change of U.S. general approach and actual behavior toward the Iranian nation,\\" which it said needed \\"reform\\". The softening dialogue came amid U.S. military exercises in the Arabian Sea, which saw various aircraft \\"simulating strike operations\\"; Yahya Rahim Safavi, top military aide to Ayatollah Khameini, said that U.S. military vessels in the Persian Gulf were within range of Iranian missiles and warned that any clash between the two countries would push oil prices above $100 a barrel. U.S. President Donald Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman blamed Iran for tanker attacks. On 6 June, U.S. Central Command commander Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. warned that Iran and its \\"proxy\\" forces still posed an \\"imminent\\" threat to U.S. forces: \\"I think we're still in the period of what I would call tactical warning...The threat is very real.\\"  June 2019 Gulf of Oman incident  On 17 June, the U.S. announced the deployment of 1,000 more soldiers to the Middle East after a second incident in the Gulf of Oman that saw two oil tankers catch fire after allegedly being attacked by limpet mines or flying objects. As in the May incident, the U.S. blamed Iranian forces for the attacks.  June 2019 Iranian shoot-down of U.S. drone  seen here off the coast of Australia, was deployed to the Persian Gulf in June 2019 as a result of increased tensions between US and Iran. Tensions reached a new high when, on 20 June, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shot down a U.S. RQ-4A Global Hawk surveillance drone, claiming that the drone violated Iranian airspace. IRGC commander Hossein Salami called the shoot-down a \\"clear message\\" to the U.S. while also warning that, though they were not seeking war, Iran was \\"completely ready\\" for it. U.S. Central Command later confirmed that the drone was shot down by Iranian surface-to-air missiles but denied that it violated Iranian airspace, calling it an \\"unprovoked attack\\" and in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. Iran and the United States provided conflicting GPS coordinates for the drone's location, making it unclear whether the drone was within Iran's 12-mile territorial boundary. President Trump called Iran's downing of the drone a \\"big mistake\\". The United States requested a June 24 closed-door United Nations Security Council meeting to address the regional tensions with Iran, according to diplomats. Media outlets such as The New York Times and ABC News reported that Trump had ordered a retaliatory military strike on Iran on 20 June, but withdrew his decision minutes before the operation began. Trump said the next day that he had decided to halt the operation after being told that as many as 150 Iranians would be killed, although some administration officials said Trump had been advised of the potential casualties before he ordered the operation to be prepared. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton reportedly objected to the reversal. On June 22, it was reported that President Trump had approved cyber attacks that disabled IRGC computer systems used to control rocket and missile launches the night of the drone-downing. The cyber strikes were handled by U.S. Cyber Command in conjunction with U.S. Central Command. It represented the first offensive show of force since Cyber Command was elevated to a full combatant command in May 2019. Also on June 22, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning to U.S. industries that Iran is stepping up cyber attacks of critical industries—particularly oil, gas and other energy sectors—and government agencies, and has the potential to disrupt or destroy systems. On June 23, Iranian Major general Gholam Ali Rashid warned the U.S. of \\"uncontrollable\\" consequences should a conflict breakout. During a speech in Israel, John Bolton said Iran should not \\"mistake U.S. prudence and discretion for weakness,\\" emphasizing that future military options are not ruled out and that Trump had only \\"stopped the strike from going forward at this time\\". Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited the Persian Gulf region for talks with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in a bid to build a coalition to combat perceived Iranian nuclear and \\"terror\\" ambitions. Meanwhile, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani blamed the United States' \\"interventionist military presence\\" for the high tensions. On June 24, Trump announced new sanctions against the Iranian and IRGC leadership, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his office. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions will block \\"billions\\" in assets and that Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif will also be sanctioned within the week. In classified briefings, Mike Pompeo and other U.S. State Department and Pentagon officials reportedly advised members of the U.S. Congress on what they described as alarming ties between Iran and al- Qaeda—including giving the terrorist organization safe haven in the country. The New York Times reported that lawmakers were leery of assertions of Iranian links to al-Qaeda, notably due to concerns that the administration may be using specious assertions to build a case for military action against Iran based on the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists—supposed links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda were used as partial justification to invade Iraq in 2003. On June 27, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy flatly denied that Pentagon officials linked al-Qaeda to Iran during Congressional meetings. \\"In these briefings, none of the officials mentioned al-Qa'ida or the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force,\\" Mulroy stated, adding that he and the Defense Intelligence Agency instead \\"described the historical ties between Iran and the Taliban, and I explained that these ties are widely and publicly known and referenced in articles and books\\". On June 24, Trump told reporters that he did not need congressional consent for an initial strike on Iran. On June 25, Iran said that the new U.S. sanctions prompted a \\"permanent closure\\" of their diplomatic ties, and the regime refused to negotiate with Washington until the sanctions were lifted. On June 27, Javad Zarif tweeted that sanctions are not an \\"alternative to war; they ARE war\\" and argued that Trump's usage of the term \\"obliteration\\" against Iran is a reference to genocide, a war crime. He also said that negotiations and threats are \\"mutually exclusive\\" and called the concept of a short war with Iran an \\"illusion\\". Following the drone shoot- down, the U.S. continued unabated to deploy military assets to the region. By June 28, the U.S. had deployed nearly a dozen F-22 Raptor fighter jets to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar—the first-ever deployment of F-22s to the base—to \\"defend American forces and interests\\".  July 2019 alleged American jamming of Iranian drone  On July 18, according to the Pentagon, took defensive action against an Iranian drone that had closed with the ship in the Persian Gulf to approximately and jammed the drone, causing downing of the aircraft. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi denied any of the country's drones had been brought down. Iran showed footage of the USS Boxer in a move to disprove Donald Trump's claims that the US shot down an Iranian drone in the Gulf.Iran taunts Trump with video of warships after president claims US shot down drone On 15 September 2019, Iran ruled out the accusations of the United States of it conducting drone attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil fields. Iran also warned that it is ready for a \\"full-fledged\\" war.  November 2019 Iran gasoline price protests  On 15 November 2019, Iranian authorities raised gasoline prices for civilians and imposed strict rationing rules. The 50 per cent price rise from 10,000 to 15,000 riyals per litre led to an outbreak of violent protests across the country. Protesters demanded that President Hassan Rouhani step down. The gasoline price rises were introduced because of deteriorating economic conditions in Iran, which were partly due to the U.S. sanctions. On 19 November 2019, the United States expressed its support for the protesters and condemned the Iranian government. Multiple officials of the Trump administration, including Mike Pompeo and Stephanie Grisham, made statements in support of the Iranians. US President Donald Trump said, on 3 December 2019, in an interview, while he was in London for a NATO Summit, they are \\"killing perhaps thousands and thousands of people right now as we speak\\".Trump Accuses Iran of ‘Killing Thousands’ of Protesters  December 2019 Kata'ib Hezbollah – U.S. attacks in Iraq  On 27 December 2019, a rocket attack on the K1 military base in Iraq, which houses U.S. and Iraqi forces, killed a U.S. civilian contractor and wounded several U.S. and Iraqi service members. U.S. officials stated that there was an involvement of Kata'ib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Iraqi Shi'ite militia group. On 29 December 2019, the U.S. conducted airstrikes against Kata'ib Hezbollah in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for the death of the U.S. contractor. At least 25 Kata'ib Hezbollah fighters were killed and more than 50 wounded. In response, Iranian-backed militia groups stormed the US Embassy in Baghdad on December 31, 2019. They burned buildings and defaced property. The group of people left the Embassy on January 1, 2020.  Targeted killing of Qasem Soleimani, Iranian retaliation and Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 shoot-down  thumb On 3 January 2020, the U.S. assassinated the Iranian General Qasem Soleimani with an airstrike in Iraq. Soleimani was head of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran behind Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. 'VS doden topgeneraal Iran, vrees voor escalatie groeit' (US kill top general Iran, fear for escalation grows). NRC Handelsblad, 3 January 2020. Retrieved 10 January 2020. This killing steeply escalated the decades-old tensions between the two countries.Carolien Roelants, Iran expert of NRC Handelsblad, in a debate on Buitenhof on Dutch television, 5 January 2020. Khamenei vowed \\"severe revenge\\" against the United States. Declaring three days of public mourning for the general's death, Khamenei stated that \\"harsh retaliation\\" waited for the U.S. In the aftermath of Soleimani's killing, the U.S. announced to move over 3,000 additional troops to the Middle East from the 82nd Airborne Division as a precautionary measure amid rising threats from Iran. On the same day, Switzerland said it had conveyed a U.S. diplomatic message to Iran. Iran said that in the note, the United States had called for a \\"proportional response\\" to the killing of the Quds Force leader. In turn, Iran summoned the Swiss envoy and stated that the Americans \\"made a wrong move and are now worried about its consequences\\". On January 7, Iran's Parliament unanimously passed a bill naming all branches of the US Armed Forces and employees of The Pentagon \\"terrorists\\". The bill states \\"Any aid to these forces, including military, intelligence, financial, technical, service or logistical, will be considered as cooperation in a terrorist act\\". Demonstrations in Iran over the death of Qasem Soleimani during the U.S attack on the Baghdad airport in Iraq on January 3, 2020 Later, at approximately 5:30 pm (EST), Iran carried out \\"Operation Martyr Soleimani\\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-middle-east-51029181 launching 12 to 15 missiles to strike multiple US targets located throughout Iraq, including Al-Assad Airbase where about 1,500 soldiers are housed and Erbil. After an assessment of damages, no casualties were reported. Iran later threaten action against other nations, issuing the statement on Iranian state media \\"We are warning all American allies, who gave their bases to its terrorist army, that any territory that is the starting point of aggressive acts against Iran will be targeted.\\" In response Donald Trump posted via Twitter \\"All is well! Missiles launched from Iran at two military bases located in Iraq. Assessment of casualties & damages taking place now. So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far! I will be making a statement tomorrow morning.\\" Very soon after Trump's response, Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 was shot down by the IRGC after being mistaken for a U. S. cruise missile killing all 176 passengers and crew. Iran issues an arrest warrant for 36 U.S. political and military officials, including President Trump, for their role in the assassination of Qasem Soleimani.  March 11 Attack and Retaliation  The Washington officials claimed in mid of March that an Iran-backed militia group attacked the US military base in Iraq, which killed two American soldiers and a British soldier. Later, during the same week, the US military launched a missile strike against Kata'ib Hezbollah in Iraq, which led to the killing of militiamen, a civilian present at the base, along with five Iraqi servicemen. In retaliation, rockets again struck near the Green Zone of the US Embassy in Baghdad. Reported Threats of Retaliation On 14 September 2020, United States President Donald Trump tweeted and warned Iran of severe consequences if it tried to carry out an assassination attempt or attack against the US. This came a day after a media report alleged that the Iranian government was hatching a plot to assassinate American ambassador to South Africa Lana Marks. The Iranian foreign ministry called the allegation of an assassination plot “baseless” and part of “repetitive and rotten methods to create an anti-Iranian atmosphere on the international stage.”  New exchange of words after days of protest in Iran  On 17 January 2020, after facing several days of anti-government protests, Khamenei reappeared, after eight years, in Tehran Friday Prayer to repeat his threats against United States and other western countries. Donald Trump replied in his tweets, Khamenei \\"should be very careful with his words!\\".Trump says Iran's Khamenei 'should be very careful with his words'Trump Mocks Iran's Khamenei After His Uncompromising Speech  COVID-19 pandemic  Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying his country was struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei claimed that the virus was genetically targeted at Iranians by the US, and this is why it is seriously affecting Iran. He did not offer any evidence. U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be willing to provide coronavirus aid, such as ventilators, to Iran to help deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Military Satellite  The aircraft flew into orbit on a multi-stage rocket and was launched from the Shahroud missile range in northern Iran. While not a present threat to the United States and other Iranian adversaries, the completion of the Noor-1 mission confirms the technical competency of the nascent Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp's (IRGC). Though lauded by the Tasnim News Agency as a national \\"milestone,\\" the Islamic Republic is not inexperienced in space exploration and, particularly, low-earth orbit operations. In both 2009, 2015, and 2017, Iran sent, respectively, the Omid, Fajr, and Simorgh satellites into orbit. Despite recent setbacks with high-ranking assassinations and pandemic resistance, the 2020 launch sends a clear message to all Middle Eastern and transoceanic powers: Iran continues to make progress in its quest for regional supremacy and advanced domestic and military technology. Mounting pressure in the last decade has U.S. military and political leaders fearful of Iran's capability of creating ballistic-carrying spacecraft. U.S. Sectretary of State Mike Pompeo disapproved of Iran's successful launch, stating that it proves that the space program is “neither peaceful nor entirely civilian,\\" but the Trump administration, supposedly, \\"never believed this fiction.\\" During a press conference on 22 April, Pompeo said: \\"“The Iranians have consistently said that these missile programs were disconnected from their military, that these were purely commercial enterprises. I think today’s launch proves what we’ve been saying all along here in the United States: The IRGC, a designated terrorist organization, launched a missile today.”  Economic relations  Trade between Iran and the United States reached $623 million in 2008. According to the United States Census Bureau, American exports to Iran reached $93 million in 2007 and $537 million in 2008. American imports from Iran decreased from $148 million in 2007 to $86 million in 2008.http://previous.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=119065&sectionid;=3510213http://www.nitc.co.ir/iran- daily/1387/3300/html/economy.htm This data does not include trade conducted through third countries to circumvent the trade embargo. It has been reported that the United States Treasury Department has granted nearly 10,000 special licenses to American companies over the past decade to conduct business with Iran.\\"Report: U.S. Treasury approved business with Iran.\\" AP, 24 December 2010. US exports to Iran include cigarettes (US$73 million), corn (US$68 million); chemical wood pulp, soda or sulfate (US$64 million); soybeans (US$43 million); medical equipment (US$27 million); vitamins (US$18 million); and vegetable seeds (US$12 million). In 2010, US exports to Iran dropped by 50% to $281.8 million. In May 2013, US President Barack Obama lifted a trade embargo of communications equipment and software to non-government Iranians. In June 2013, the Obama administration expanded its sanctions against Iran, targeting its auto industry and, for the first time, its currency. Fourth match between Iran and the US during the 2015 FIVB Volleyball World League As of January 2014, the successful conclusion and implementation of an interim diplomatic agreement restricting Iranian nuclear development, negotiated between Iran and major world powers in Geneva, has led to the release of some of Iran's frozen overseas assets as well as a partial lifting of sanctions previously placed upon Iranian trade in automotive parts, petrochemicals, and precious metals. The United States government has also pledged to continue renewing the exemptions to oil sanctions currently enjoyed by states such as India and South Korea, key customers of the Iranian oil sector. Restrictions placed upon the insurance against loss of Iranian seagoing vessels have also been waived at the completion of the 2013 agreements in Geneva. According to a 2014 study by the National Iranian American Council, sanctions cost the US over $175 billion in lost trade and 279,000 lost job opportunities. According to Business Monitor International: On 22 April 2019, under the Trump administration, the U.S. demanded that buyers of Iranian oil stop purchases or face economic penalties, announcing that the six-month sanction exemptions for China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey instated a year prior would not be renewed and would end by 1 May. The move was seen as an attempt to completely stifle Iran's oil exports. Iran insisted the sanctions were illegal and that it had attached \\"no value or credibility\\" to the waivers. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said President Trump's decision not to renew the waivers showed his administration was \\"dramatically accelerating our pressure campaign in a calibrated way that meets our national security objectives while maintaining well supplied global oil markets\\". On 30 April, Iran stated it would continue to export oil despite U.S. pressure. On 8 May 2019, exactly one year after the Trump administration withdrew the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the U.S. imposed a new layer of duplicate sanctions on Iran, targeting its metal exports, a sector that generates 10 percent of its export revenue. The move came amid escalating tension in the region and just hours after Iran threatened to start enriching more uranium if it did not get relief from U.S. measures that are crippling its economy. The Trump administration has said the sanctions will only be lifted if Iran fundamentally changes its behavior and character. On 24 June 2019, following continued escalations in the Strait of Hormuz, President Donald Trump announced new targeted sanctions against Iranian and IRGC leadership, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his office. IRGC targets included Naval commander Alireza Tangsiri, Aerospace commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh, and Ground commander Mohammad Pakpour, and others. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the sanctions will block \\"billions\\" in assets. On 8 July 2019, Iran claims to have surpassed the nuclear enrichment level set during the 2015 Iran Deal. The US Treasury Department Financial Crimes Enforcement Network imposed a measure that further prohibits the US banking system from use by an Iranian bank, thereby requiring US banks to step up due diligence on the accounts in their custody. The US Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) blacklisted four Iranian metal sector organizations along with their foreign subsidiaries, on 23 July 2020. One German subsidiary and three in the United Arab Emirates – owned and controlled by Iran's biggest steel manufacturer, Mobarakeh Steel Company – were also blacklisted by Washington for yielding millions of dollars for Iran's aluminum, steel, iron, and copper sectors. The sanctions froze all US assets controlled by the companies in question and further prohibited Americans from associating with them. On October 8, 2020, the U.S. Treasury Department placed sanctions on 18 Iranian banks. Any American connection to these banks is to be blocked and reported to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, and, 45 days after the sanctions take effect, anyone transacting with these banks may \\"be subject to an enforcement action.\\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the goal was to pressure Iran to end nuclear activities and terrorist funding.

Situated atop the Scarborough Bluffs, it occupies the eastern part of the city. Scarborough is contained within the borders of Victoria Park Avenue on the west, Steeles Avenue to the north, Rouge River and the city of Pickering to the east, and Lake Ontario to the south. It borders Old Toronto, East York and North York in the west and the city of Markham in the north. Scarborough was named after the English town of Scarborough, North Yorkshire. First settled by Europeans in the 1790s, Scarborough has grown from a collection of small rural villages and farms to become fully urbanized with a diverse cultural community. Incorporated in 1850 as a township, Scarborough became part of Metropolitan Toronto in 1953 and was reconstituted as a borough in 1967. Scarborough rapidly developed as a suburb of Toronto over the next decade and became a city in 1983. In 1998, Scarborough and the rest of Metropolitan Toronto were amalgamated into the present city of Toronto. Scarborough still exists in name and as a borough of Toronto. The Scarborough Civic Centre, the former city‘s last place of government, is occupied by City of Toronto government offices. Scarborough is a popular destination for new immigrants in Canada to reside. As a result, it is one of the most diverse and multicultural areas in the Greater Toronto Area, being home to various religious groups and places of worship. It includes a number of natural landmarks, including the Toronto Zoo, Rouge Park and the Scarborough Bluffs. The northeast corner of Scarborough is largely rural with some of Toronto’s last remaining farms, earning Scarborough its reputation of being greener than any other part of Toronto. Etymology The area was named after Scarborough in England, United Kingdom by Elizabeth Simcoe, the wife of John Graves Simcoe, the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada. The bluffs along Scarborough's Lake Ontario shores reminded her of the limestone cliffs in Scarborough, England. On August 4, 1793, she wrote in her diary, \\"The shore is extremely bold, and has the appearance of chalk cliffs, but I believe they are only white sand. They appeared so well that we talked of building a summer residence there and calling it Scarborough.\\" Before that, the area was named Glasgow, after the Scottish city. Scarborough has acquired several nicknames. A popular one is Scarberia, a portmanteau of Scarborough and Siberia, a reference to its seemingly distant eastern location from downtown Toronto and apparent lack of notable attractions. The word originated sometime in the 1960s and has remained a source of contention ever since. In May 1988, Joyce Trimmer, who was campaigning to be mayor of the city of Scarborough, said, \\"The city of Scarborough needs strong leadership if it is to shed its 'Scarberia' image\\". With the increased popularity of social media, ScarbTO has become a popular online signifier of the community. Scarborough has also acquired nicknames related to its diversity. Such nicknames typically use the prefix \\"Scar\\" and a suffix derived from the name of a region, nation, or ethnicity; for instance, \\"Scompton\\" or \\"Scarlem\\", alluding to Compton and Harlem respectively. History Seneca settlement of Ganatsekwyagon, in present-day Scarborough The first known evidence of people in Scarborough comes from an archaeological site in Fenwood Heights, which has been dated to 8000 BCE. The site contains the remains of a camp of nomadic hunters and foragers, and there is no evidence of permanent settlers. In the 17th century, the area was inhabited by the Seneca at the village of Ganatsekwyagon, who were later displaced by the Mississaugas, who were themselves displaced by the settlers who began to arrive in the late 18th century. After the land was surveyed in 1793, it was opened to settlement by British subjects with the first issue of land patents in 1796, although squatters had already been present for a few years. The first settlers were David and Andrew Thomson. They were stonemasons who worked on the first parliament buildings for York. They each built mills. This activity led to the creation of a small village known as the Thomson Settlement.Thomson Settlement. Toronto Historical Plaque. Toronto Historical Plaques The first post office opened in 1832, in Scarborough Village. During the early part of life in Upper Canada, local administration and justice was administered by the colonial government. From 1792 to 1841, magistrates were appointed by District Councils. There were four districts in the colony of which Scarborough was part of the Home District. Partly due to a political reorganization that was a result of the Durham Report, Scarborough gained elected representation on the Home District Council. Scarborough elected two councillors. In 1850, Scarborough was incorporated as a township. After incorporation, Scarborough government was led by a reeve, a deputy-reeve and three councillors, each elected annually. Initially the council met in the village of Woburn but it was relocated to Birchcliff in 1922, where most of the population was then located. During the Great Depression the local government was on the verge of bankruptcy. The Ontario Municipal Board stepped in and appointed an oversight committee which prevented the collapse of local government. Kingston Road, looking south on Birchmount Road. The first transit line in Scarborough was established in 1893. The expansion of Toronto in the east, in the 19th century, led to the development of housing stock along the Kingston Road and Danforth Road corridors in Scarborough. This led to the creation of a transit line. In 1893, the Toronto and Scarboro' Electric Railway, Light and Power Company built a single-track radial line along Kingston Road to Blantyre. Over the next 13 years this was extended to West Hill. In 1904, the line became the Scarboro Division of the Toronto and York Radial Railway. Service continued along this line until 1936 when it was replaced by bus service. On April 15, 1953, Scarborough was included within Metropolitan Toronto, a new upper level of municipal government with jurisdiction over regional services such as arterial roads and transit, police, and ambulance services. (Fire fighting services remained separate.) Scarborough retained its local council but gained representation on a new Metro Council. The new council had 24 members, 12 from the old city of Toronto and 12 from the suburban municipalities. The council was not directly elected but was made up of members of each of the local councils. Scarborough's contribution was its reeve who at the time was Oliver Crockford. In 1967, Scarborough was incorporated as a borough. The reeve was replaced with a mayor. Albert Campbell, who had been reeve since 1957, became Scarborough's first mayor. The new borough's council consisted of the mayor and four members of the board of control (which functioned as an executive committee). There were also ten aldermen. The mayor and the controllers also sat on Metro Council. In 1973, Scarborough increased in size when the West Rouge area, formerly within the Township of Pickering, was transferred to it with the creation of the Regional Municipality of Durham. The borough's status was changed to city in 1983. The number of aldermen was increased to 14 and the term of office extended to three years from two. A number of high-rise and condominiums were built around Scarborough City Centre in the late-20th to early-21st century. As the urban area continued to expand, much of rural Scarborough was converted to suburban housing developments in the last third of the 20th century. At the start of the 21st century, growth occurred along the Highway 401 corridor at the northern end of the Scarborough RT; highrise condominium projects have increased the residential density around Scarborough City Centre. In 1988, there was a reorganization. The board of control was abolished. Alderman was changed to councillor. Six additional metro council positions were created and these were elected separately for the first time. Scarborough's council consisted of a mayor, 14 local councillors and six Metro councillors. In 1998, Scarborough was amalgamated with North York, Etobicoke, York, East York and the old city of Toronto to become the new city of Toronto. Coat of arms Coat of arms of former Scarborough The coat of arms of Scarborough was adopted when the borough became a city on June 29, 1983. A grant of arms was issued by the Canadian Heraldic Authority on February 1, 1996.

The creek is one two watersheds that pass through Scarborough. Scarborough's borders are Victoria Park Avenue (North York, East York, and Old Toronto) to the west, the Rouge River, the Little Rouge Creek and the Scarborough-Pickering Townline (Pickering) to the east, Steeles Avenue (Markham) to the north, and Lake Ontario to the south. Topographically, Scarborough is dominated by two watersheds, Highland Creek and the Rouge River. Highland Creek lies almost entirely within Scarborough and occupies approximately 70% of its total area. It occupies the western half of Scarborough, while the Rouge River flows through the eastern portion. Both of these rivers flow into Lake Ontario on Scarborough's shore. Due to the location of the Lakeshore CN railway right-of-way, both river deltas are constricted to narrow channels where they flow into the lake. Highland Creek is the most urbanized watershed in the Toronto area without about 85% of its land use devoted to urban uses. Some sections of the river run through parks and remain in a fairly natural state, while other parts run through industrial or residential districts where the flow is often diverted or channelled. Sections of the creek are marked by deep ravines and valleys, which contain little or no urban development. The deep valley the creek cuts in its bottom sections remains primarily parkland, with little or no development taking place within the valley. Conversely, the Rouge River Valley, parts of which are still in a natural, wooded state. The valley is home to a great variety of wildlife including deer, foxes, and the occasional coyote, while the river hosts salmon and catfish. The Rouge River Valley forms a part of Rouge National Urban Park, a national urban park situated along the eastern portion of Scarborough, and its neighbouring municipalities. Scarborough is home to an earthen escarpment formation known as the Scarborough Bluffs. The Bluffs can be found along the shore of Lake Ontario, stretching about , and reaching heights of more than in places. They are part of a much larger formation known as the Iroquois Shoreline, most of which is located somewhat further inland. The Iroquois Shoreline marks the extent of a prehistoric lake, Glacial Lake Iroquois, whose level was quite a bit higher than present-day Lake Ontario's. It shrank in size at the close of the last ice age. Erosion has been a problem along the Scarborough Bluffs. Properties located near the brink have been abandoned, and houses condemned, as the brink wears back away from the lake. Since the 1980s, large areas of beach at the base of the Bluffs have been reinforced with limestone breakwaters and construction rubble infilling. Climate Scarborough's climate is moderate for Canada due to its southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario. It has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb), with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends to be slightly lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance, due in part to the weather station being farther from the moderating influence of the lake and also because of its more northeast location. Conditions vary based on proximity to the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot summer days.Canadian climate normals for 1971 to 2000, Environment Canada (2004).

Demographics Visible minority population as of the 2006 Census Population growth for Scarborough, 1796–2001 The vast majority of Scarborough's population is composed of immigrants who have arrived in the last four decades, and their descendants. In 2006, 57% of residents were foreign-born. Visible minorities make up 67.4% of the population. The population is 22.0% South Asian, 19.5% Chinese, 10.3% Black, and 6.5% Filipino. The remaining visible minority groups each represented less than 2% of the population. The immigrant population has created vibrant multicultural locales in various areas of Scarborough. One of the more notable among these is the heavy concentration of Chinese businesses and restaurants in the Agincourt neighbourhood. Many of Scarborough's main arteries, including segments of Kingston Road, Eglinton Avenue East and Lawrence Avenue East, feature Caribbean, Chinese, African, and Indian restaurants and shops, as well as businesses representing the other ethnic groups in the area. Scarborough also has the largest concentration of Sri Lankan Tamils outside Sri Lanka. In terms of religion, there were 280,330 Christians (49.1%), 75,325 Hindus (13.1%) and 60,425 Muslims (10.5%) residing in Scarborough according to the 2011 National Household Survey. The majority of Scarborough's population is between 25 and 64 years old. 52% fell into that \\"working age\\" during the last major survey, which also found 21% of Scarborough's population was 14 years old or younger, 15% were between 15 and 24, while senior citizens aged 65+ made up the remaining 12%. Like the rest of Canada, Scarborough's population is aging. It is projected that close to 30% of Scarborough residents will be senior citizens by 2041. This had made Scarborough a popular location for retirement communities, which attracts more seniors to the area creating a situation where the two largest age demographics in Scarborough will be over 55 and under 25. {  - ! colspan=2  Ethnic groups in Scarborough (2016) !

Toronto Police Service YTD Stats According to former Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair, \\"[42 Division is] the safest division in the city\\"; this division includes north Scarborough. The safest part of Toronto is north Scarborough from Victoria Park Ave. to the Pickering border, north of Highway 401. In 2008, councillors Norm Kelly and Michael Thompson argued that the media was distorting how crime was reported in Scarborough. They noted that whenever a shooting occurred in the rest of the city the location was given as the nearest major intersection, while when a shooting happened in Scarborough the location was given as 'Scarborough'. According to the councillors, this gave people an erroneous impression of Scarborough as 'crime-ridden'. They proposed that news outlets sign a 'media protocol' so that all crime locations were given as intersections. However, the city's Executive Committee turned down the request citing this as a form of censorship. Mayor David Miller said \\"It’s not city council’s role to tell the media how to do their job\\".

Governance The Scarborough Community Council meets once a month at the Scarborough Civic Centre. From the incorporation of Scarborough as a township in 1850, the head of the local government was a reeve who chaired the town council. In 1953, Scarborough and twelve other townships, towns, and villages in York County federated with the City of Toronto to form Metropolitan Toronto. Scarborough retained its own town council but an added layer of government, the Metropolitan Toronto Council, with the reeve of Scarborough having a seat. In 1967, Scarborough was incorporated as borough at which point the head of the local government was styled as mayor. A Board of Control, consisting of the mayor and four directly elected Controllers, was also created as an executive committee of Scarborough's council, whose members also sat on Metro Council. In 1983, Scarborough attained city status, but its governing structure remained the same. In 1988, the Board of Control was abolished. Scarboro council backs 48 per cent raise in pay\\" Abbate, Gay. The Globe and Mail (1936-2016); Toronto, Ont. [Toronto, Ont]22 Sep 1988: A23. In 1998, the municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto were amalgamated into a single City of Toronto. Since 1998, Scarborough has been a community within the city of Toronto, and the head of the local government is the Mayor of Toronto and governed by Toronto City Council, though the members of city council elected from Scarborough also meet as a community council, which reports to Toronto City Council but has final decision-making power on certain items, such as front yard parking and appointments to local boards and Business Improvement Areas. Since 1973, meetings of the Borough Council, then the Scarborough City Council, and now the Scarborough Community Council occur at the Scarborough Civic Centre, which functioned as Scarborough's city hall, until amalgamation. Scarborough is represented by five ridings for the provincial government and five full ridings plus one partial riding for the Federal government. The Federal riding of Pickering—Scarborough East straddles the border between Scarborough and Pickering. Municipal riding boundaries were harmonized within the City of Toronto to match the provincial boundaries in 1999 through provincial legislation called The Fewer Municipal Politicians Act of 1999. This took effect on December 1, 2000. Each provincial riding is split between two city councillors. Thus Scarborough is represented by ten councillors. After amalgamation with Toronto, community councils were formed to process issues considered local to their community. Scarborough's community council, made up of Scarborough's ten councillors, meets once a month at the former offices of the city of Scarborough just south of the Scarborough Town Centre. The council deals with a variety of local issues such as outdoor patio applications, neighbourhood traffic plans, and exemptions from certain by-laws such as retail signs, fences, trees and ravines. Decisions made by community council are approved by Toronto City Council in order to take effect.

GO Transit also has a few bus terminals and stops in Scarborough. Roads and highways Eglinton Avenue is a major east–west roadway that passes through Scarborough. The arterial roads of Scarborough were laid out on a grid system of north–south and east–west. Kingston Road and Danforth Road were laid out prior to the surveying of the township, and both run diagonally in a southwest–northeast direction across the south end of Scarborough. From north to south, the major east–west arterial roads are Steeles Avenue, Finch Avenue, Sheppard Avenue, Ellesmere Road, Lawrence Avenue, Eglinton Avenue and St. Clair Avenue. From west to east, the major north–south arterial roads are Victoria Park Avenue, Pharmacy Avenue, Warden Avenue, Birchmount Road, Kennedy Road, Midland Avenue, Brimley Road, McCowan Road, Bellamy Road North, Markham Road, Neilson Road, Morningside Avenue, Meadowvale Road and Port Union Road. Kingston Road was formerly Ontario Highway 2, and was the main highway through Scarborough until the building of the Highway 401, which runs east–west across the middle of Scarborough, with six to eight lanes in each direction. The short, minor freeway Highway 2A runs parallel to Lake Ontario in the eastern part of Scarborough. In the 1960s, Metropolitan Toronto planned to build a second east–west highway across Scarborough. It was intended to link Highway 2A with an eastern extension of the Gardiner Expressway.

Upgrades completed in 2011 allow it to process up to 800 megalitres per day and it will also be the first plant to replace chlorine with ozone as its primary cleansing method. Wastewater for Scarborough is treated at the Highland Creek Water Pollution Control Plant. This plant was constructed in 1954 and started processing in 1956. It has undergone continual expansion to meet ongoing demand. Electricity is mainly provided in Scarborough by Toronto Hydro. Solid waste Early garbage collection in Scarborough was performed by individual communities and dumped in local landfills which were located in nearby ravines. In 1967 waste collection was reorganized. Local landfills were closed and most of the garbage was directed to a new landfill on Beare Road in eastern Scarborough. This dump was eventually closed in 1981. A waste transfer site was constructed near Markham Road and Sheppard Avenue East. From there garbage was trucked to the Keele Valley dump in Vaughan and the Brock Road dump in Pickering. In 2002 the Keele Valley landfill was closed. As part of Toronto's overall waste management, garbage was then trucked to Michigan. This arrangement lasted until 2010 when garbage was sent to the new Green Lane landfill site in Elgin County.

At the time of its cancellation by the Fox television network in June 2011, it was the longest-running program in the network's history (25 seasons), a mark since surpassed by The Simpsons. The show started off as a half-hour program on February 7, 1988. In 1990, the show's format was changed from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. The show's format was reverted to 30 minutes in 1995, and then back to 60 minutes in 1996. A short- lived syndicated spinoff titled America's Most Wanted: Final Justice aired during the 1995-96 season. The following September, the show's host, John Walsh, announced that it would resume later that year on the cable network Lifetime,'America's Most Wanted' To Live Again... On Lifetime, TVNewser, September 7, 2011 where it ran until its March 28, 2013, cancellation. This was reportedly due to low ratings and the level of royalty payments to Fox which holds the trademark and copyright. It was succeeded by John Walsh Investigates, a one-off special on Lifetime. The show featured reenactments of dangerous fugitives that are portrayed by actors, interspersed with on-camera interviews, with Walsh in a voiceover narration. Each episode also featured photographs of dangerous fugitives, as well a toll-free hotline number where viewers could give information at 1-800-CRIME-TV. On May 2, 2008, the program's website announced its 1,000th capture. Many of the series' cases have some connection outside the United States or have not taken place in the United States at all. The series' first international capture was in Nova Scotia in 1989. With Walsh at the helm, America's Most Wanted began to broaden its scope. In addition to the regular segments narrated by Walsh, the show expanded its segments and correspondents. The first two-hour quarterly special aired on Saturday, October 29, 2011, on Fox.FOX Announces 2011 Fall TV Premiere Dates TV By the Numbers The second two-hour special aired on Saturday, December 17, 2011, the third two-hour special aired on Saturday, February 11, 2012, and the fourth and final two-hour special aired on Saturday, April 21, 2012. On July 13, 2014, a successor premiered on CNN called The Hunt with John Walsh, which added more international stories to its predecessor. The series ran until the end of its fourth season on November 19, 2017. In 2019, Walsh began hosting the Investigation Discovery series In Pursuit with John Walsh. In January 2020, Fox announced plans to revive America's Most Wanted. The network is seeking a new host. History Conception and early airing The concept for America's Most Wanted originally came from a German show, Aktenzeichen XY ... ungelöst (German for File Reference XY ... Unsolved), that first aired in 1967, and the British show Crimewatch, first aired in 1984, with the US version conceived by Fox executive Stephen Chao and Executive Producer Michael Linder in the summer of 1987. Even earlier, however, CBS aired a three-month half-hour similar series hosted by Walter McGraw in the 1955–1956 season entitled Wanted. John Walsh presenting a fugitive While Linder was shooting the pilot episode in Indiana, Chao and Fox attorney Tom Herwitz conducted a hurried search for a host. Chao's first choice was former police officer and best-selling author Joseph Wambaugh, but Wambaugh refused, saying he didn't believe a national dragnet would work in the United States. Chao also considered asking then-recently resigned U.S. Attorney (and future New York City mayor) Rudolph Giuliani, former Virginia governor Chuck Robb and former Oklahoma governor Bob Curry before deciding a politician might use the show as a platform for personal political ambitions. Other potential candidates included former Marine Corps Commandant General P. X. Kelly, journalists Linda Ellerbee and Bob Woodward, and victims' advocate Theresa Saldana. Then, during a marathon telephone conference call, Herwitz suggested John Walsh. Walsh had gained publicity after his six-year-old son, Adam, was kidnapped and murdered in 1981. The crime had been the subject of the 1983 television film Adam, and Walsh's later advocacy had resulted in new legislation to protect missing children, as well as the creation of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. After lengthy discussions, Walsh agreed to host the pilot episode. America's Most Wanted debuted as a half-hour program on February 7, 1988, on the then- seven Fox owned and operated stations, located in New York; Los Angeles; Washington, D.C.; Houston; Chicago; Dallas; and Boston. Within four days of the first broadcast, FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitive David James Roberts was captured as a direct result. He was a convicted killer who had recently escaped from prison by digging his way out with a small axe. This demonstrated the effectiveness of the show's \\"Watch Television, Catch Criminals\\" premise to skeptical law enforcement agencies. Ten weeks later, the program premiered nationwide on the Fox network and became the fledgling network's first hit series. In 1990, the show's format was changed from 30 minutes to 60 minutes. The show was cut back to 30 minutes in 1995, and back to 60 minutes in 1996. From 1995 to 1996, a short-lived syndicated spinoff titled America's Most Wanted: Final Justice aired. The announcer heard on the show from 1996 until his death in 2008 was well-known voice-over artist Don LaFontaine. The first new episode aired after his death was dedicated to him. He was replaced by voice actor Wes Johnson, who served in the role until end of the show's run. Notable writers have included Peter Koper and Greg Scott. Logos The show's first logo ran from 1988 to 1990, which consisted of an eagle sitting on a tree branch in a circle, with lines, stars, and zigzags below, and it has \\"AMERICA'S MOST WANTED\\" written on it. The show's second and final logo ran from 1990 to 2012, which would be used for the rest of the show's run. In 1996, the show was retitled America's Most Wanted: America Fights Back, which ran until 2003.  1996 cancellation and revival  The program was canceled for a month and a half in the fall of 1996, per a decision made the previous spring in the wake of high production costs. In its place, Fox moved Married... with Children (then entering what soon became its final season) to 9/8c, with the new sitcom Love and Marriage following it at 9:30. Cops remained in its hour-long 8/7c block. However, protests from the public, law enforcement, and government officials, including the governors of 37 states, encouraged Fox to bring the show back, though low ratings for Married... and Love and Marriage ultimately sealed the return of AMW. Love and Marriage was canceled, and Married... was moved back to Sundays. In 1996, the show was retitled America's Most Wanted: America Fights Back, which ran until 2003. For the next 15 years afterward, the America's Most Wanted/COPS combination made Saturday evening Fox's most stable night, along with the longest unchanged primetime schedule on American television as of 2011. On March 6, 2010, Fox aired the 1000th episode of America's Most Wanted, and Walsh interviewed then President Barack Obama at the White House. In the interview, they discussed the Obama Administration's crime-fighting initiatives, as well as the impact the show has had on law enforcement and crime prevention. Covering criminals in the War on Terrorism The show expanded its focus to also cover criminals in the War on Terrorism when, on October 12, 2001, an episode aired featuring 22 most-wanted al-Qaeda operatives. The show was put together due to a request by White House aides after the same list of men had been released to the nation two days earlier. However, the first show that focused mainly on terrorism aired after the September 11 attacks and was two hours long. From Fox to Lifetime On May 16, 2011, Fox Entertainment President Kevin Reilly announced that after 23 years, America's Most Wanted, in its weekly format, would be canceled. The final weekly episode aired on June 18, 2011, though Reilly said four two-hour specials would air on Fox in the fall 2011 television season. However, Walsh said he was looking to other networks to keep the show going, saying he had \\"many, many offers\\" from other networks. Fox News Channel confirmed that its chairman Roger Ailes had been in preliminary discussions with Walsh about bringing the show to Fox News, but said \\"nothing has been decided.\\" On the final Fox episode, Walsh promised to continue the show elsewhere and told the Associated Press: \\"I want to catch bad guys and find missing children—and we're not done.\\" During the 2010–2011 season, the show averaged an audience of five million. Within hours of Fox's announcement of the show's cancellation, campaigns to save the show were started by fans through Facebook and Twitter, among other social networking sites. In September 2011, it was announced that Lifetime had picked up America's Most Wanted from Fox and it began airing on the former on December 2, 2011. On March 13, 2012, Lifetime ordered an additional 20 episodes. However, on March 28, 2013, it was announced that Lifetime had cancelled America's Most Wanted. Hotline number facts When America's Most Wanted debuted, the show's first toll-free hotline number was 1-800-CRIME-88, 1-800-274-6388, using a phoneword for \\"CRIME\\". The last 2 digits of the hotline number changed each year between 1989 and 1993 at the start of the new year until 1994, when 1-800-274-6388 was re-instituted permanently as the hotline number, with \\"88\\" now standing for \\"TV\\", making the final number read as 1-800-CRIME-TV. Both the hotline and the AMW website were shut down shortly after the end of production. AMW Dirty Dozen The AMW Dirty Dozen was John Walsh's list of notorious fugitives who had been profiled on the show who were at that time at large. It was similar in function, though not identical with, the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list; four of the Dirty Dozen were on the FBI's list. These are the Dirty Dozen, as of January 8, 2013. Currently, there are 8 fugitives still wanted despite the idea of the list being John Walsh's 12 personal most wanted. The eleventh, Andre Neverson was arrested in 2018. Paul Jackson was arrested in 2015. Resort killer Beacher Ferrel Hackney was removed after his body was discovered in September 2012.U.S. Marshals 15 Most Wanted Fugitive's Remains Found in Virginia U.S. Marshals Service (September 18, 2011). Alleged murderer William Joseph Greer has also been removed from Walsh's Dirty Dozen before despite him seemingly still on the run. * Jason Derek Brown is wanted for the murder of an armored car driver and robbery of $56,000 in front of a movie theater in Phoenix, Arizona, on November 29, 2004. He is charged in Phoenix with first-degree murder and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. He is believed to be in either British Columbia, or Mexico. On December 8, 2007, Brown was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. * Jose Fernando Corona is wanted out of Lewisville, TX for brutally murdering his wife with a chainsaw on April 26, 2010. The murder has shaken the quiet community to the core, particularly his daughter with whom he was close. Despite no criminal record, the otherwise mild-mannered father of six had a nervous breakdown and carried out this grisly act that was considered atypical of his character. Corona has since been on the run from the law, possibly hiding out with his friends in Friona. * Berny Figueroa is wanted for the murder of 2-year-old Alexia Lopez in Brenham, Texas. On March 11, 2008, Figueroa punched Lopez in the stomach, separating her large and small intestines at the daycare facility where she worked. * Robert Fisher is wanted for the murder of his wife, Mary, and his children, Brittany and Bobby Jr. in Scottsdale, Arizona, on April 10, 2001, and then burning down their house to try to cover up the crime. He is also on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List and is considered to be AMW's Public Enemy Number 1. * Alexis Flores is wanted for the kidnapping and murder of 5-year-old Iriana DeJesus in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in July 2000. The DNA Match returned in March 2007. Flores was also placed on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on June 2, 2007. * Francisco Javier Lopez Gonzalez is wanted for the murder of his step son. * Elby Hars was wanted for sexually abusing young girls in Columbia, South Carolina. He had previously served time for sexually abusing his own daughter, Terri Hars. When he was released, he found young girls to abuse, leading to him going to prison. * Daniel Hiers is wanted for the murder of his wife, Ludimila Hiers, in Goose Creek, South Carolina, in March 2005. He is also wanted for sexually abusing a child in Charleston, South Carolina, shortly before. Hiers, a former police officer, is on the U.S. Marshals 15 Most Wanted List, and they are offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to his capture. Hiers was arrested in 2018 in Shanghai, China after being on the run for 13 years. *Paul Erven Jackson and sibling Vance Roberts were believed by police to have lured teenage girls to a homemade sex-torture chamber they built in the residence they once shared in Hillsboro, Oregon. While Roberts turned himself in and was sentenced to 108 years in prison, Jackson escaped in June 1990 and was on the run until September 2015. On September 28, 2015, he was arrested by immigration officials in Guadalajara, Mexico, where Jackson appeared to have been living for years using an alias. He was transported back to the U.S. and is currently awaiting trial on kidnapping charges in Hillsboro. * Andre Neverson is wanted for the murders of his sister, Patricia Neverson, and his ex-girlfriend, Donna Davis, both in Brooklyn, New York, in July 2002. He is also on the U.S. Marshals 15 Most Wanted list. Neverson was captured on September 4, 2018. * Yaser Abdel Said was wanted for shooting his two teenage daughters to death in an \\"honor killing\\" on January 1, 2008, in Irving, Texas. He was also wanted for questioning in the girls' sexual abuse nearly a decade prior. He was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List on December 4, 2014. On August 26, 2020, Said was captured in Justin, Texas. Presumption of innocence Given that a significant number of the fugitives on America's Most Wanted had yet to face trial in a criminal court, the show adhered to the presumption of innocence as afforded under the law. For this reason, in the cases where fugitives had not yet been convicted, John Walsh would always precede his narrative of the crime with the either the terms \\"Police say...\\", \\"According to police...\\", or other such similar terms followed by a description of the crime to which the person had allegedly committed. In a handful of rare cases, America's Most Wanted profiled persons who were involved in controversial cases or who had fled to avoid prosecution on what they believed to be unfair or even framed charges. One female fugitive, who had fled to Canada, later had charges against her dismissed even after being profiled on the show. In another case, a judge ordered a change of venue for a suspected child murderer after learning that nearly the entire county had seen the suspect profiled on America's Most Wanted and believed him guilty. During its entire run, Walsh refused to ever issue a retraction, and never updated viewers on any fugitives who were later found not guilty of the crimes to which they had been profiled.\\"America's Most Wanted gunman acquitted\\", Toronto Sun – November 9, 2010\\"Guilty until Proven Innocent, the Controversy of America's Most Wanted\\", The Washington Post.

It was also referenced to during the episode Lisa’s Rival, in which the character Millhouse van Houten is mentioned to be featured on such show. This is reinforced by armed men chasing him multiple times in the episode. In season six of The Golden Girls, the fictitious mobster The Cheese Man boasts that his most recent appearance on America's Most Wanted was the highest rated episode ever.

California History Center in Le Petit Trianon  The college is the home of the California History Center, housed in a mansion called \\"Le Petit Trianon\\".  Visual and Performing Arts Center  The Visual and Performing Arts Center opened on March 6, 2009 and was built with an art exhibit and also a 400-seat performance and lecture hall that can be rented by De Anza College organizations and outside community groups.  Kirsch Center  The Kirsch Center opened in 2005 and is the lead demonstration building for innovative ways to be more sustainable. It was the first community college building in the US to receive a LEED platinum rating. A 17-year effort, the Kirsch Center was conceived and is operated by De Anza faculty, staff and students, with the philosophy that it is \\"a building that teaches about energy, resources and stewardship.\\" Over 100 environmental classes are taught in the Kirsch Center. In addition to classrooms and labs, students can work in self-paced programs at special open study stations throughout the building. A few examples of what the building features are: * Solar panel roof * Advanced natural ventilation * Raised floor for gentle air distribution and flexibility * Natural day lighting * Orientation and layout for energy efficiency and passive solar benefits * Water conservation and water runoff control * Radiant heating and cooling * Native species landscaping The building is a favorite location for policy makers, school officials, student groups, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to visit and utilize for conferences and for tours. The building was a 10 million dollar project that was funded by various groups including the student senate, Morgan Family Foundation, and Steve and Michele Kirsch Foundation.  Fujitsu Planetarium  The Fujitsu Planetarium, with its 50-foot dome and seating for 139, teaches De Anza students, field trip groups, and the public. It also includes an evening musical laser light show on its Saturday public schedule from September to April. Its optical-mechanical projector was installed in 2007, and the new digital projection system was installed in 2016. The planetarium was built in the early 1970s and was named the Minolta Planetarium until 2008.

It is located next to the Kirsch Center on the southeast corner of campus, and it was built by a group of De Anza students and faculty in 1971, after having received a US$12,000 grant. The 12 plant communities are: * Freshwater marsh and pond * Coastal sand dunes * Coastal redwoods * Foothill woodland * Grassland * Conifers * Channel islands * California desert * Coastal sage scrub * Chaparral * Riparian * Xeric display Students and visitors can learn about California's natural heritage and see plants and animals in person. Students can also conduct environmental research here and deepen their appreciation for California's biological richness.

The flea market began as a small effort by the students of De Anza College to raise money for the student body over 30 years ago and has grown into an established community event attracting vendors and patrons from throughout the state. it is still a student enterprise with the De Anza Associated Student Body paying for all of the expenses and gaining approximately $300,000 annually for a variety of programs, services and events at De Anza College. The De Anza Flea Market contains about 825 vendor stalls and usually sells out very quickly. If the weather is good the flea market will draw approximately 15,000 to 20,000 shoppers.  New mascot  In 2020, De Anza adopted a new mascot after students voted overwhelmingly the previous year to retire the Don, an outdated symbol that many students had never even seen. The Mountain Lion was chosen in December by the college mascot working group, which included DASB student representatives, student-athletes and coaches, after extensive input and campus-wide participation.De Anza Selects New Mascot. Retrieved 2020-6-13.  Police and crime  De Anza College had its own campus police department, with unarmed officers dressed in slacks and polo shirts. The department was not a POST participating agency. In 2001, the campus police departments at De Anza and Foothill College were merged to become the Foothill-De Anza College District Police.  Averted shooting  On January 29, 2001, San Jose police arrested De Anza College student Al DeGuzman, who was planning a Columbine-style shooting at the school. At his home, police found bags filled with homemade explosives including Molotov cocktails and pipe bombs, as well as numerous guns, including a semi-automatic rifle and a cut-down 12-gauge pump-action shotgun. Plans were discovered for a noon attack at De Anza College. Kelly Bennett, an employee at a Longs Drugs store in San Jose, developed pictures of DeGuzman posing with his guns and homemade bombs. She and a coworker called police, who arrived at the drugstore and waited for DeGuzman. He was arrested when he returned for his photos. It was unusual for him to drop off the film since he \\"had always developed his own film\\". De Anza evacuated over 10,000 students the next day in fear that DeGuzman may have planted bombs at the college, although none were found. In the following weeks, Bennett was praised and credited with averting a tragedy; she appeared on local news, Good Morning America, and The Today Show. DeGuzman was sentenced to serve seven years in prison after most of the charges were thrown out. Appeals by prosecutors resulted in a resentencing of 80 years. Several months later, he committed suicide by hanging himself in his cell.  Rape investigation  In 2007 the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department investigated an inquiry into allegations of sexual assault of a 17-year-old female student arising from an off-campus party on March 4, 2007 by eight members of the De Anza College baseball team. On June 4, 2007, Santa Clara County District Attorney Dolores Carr stated that no charges would be filed. This decision was questioned by some, and the Office of the Attorney General was invited by the prosecutor to perform an independent investigation of the available evidence. May 2, 2008, the attorney general's determined that there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone present with a crime.

He is best known for his service as Minister of Highways in the BC government from 1952 to 1972. Private and family life Gaglardi was born in Mission, British Columbia as one of eleven children to poor Italian immigrants.Mitchell, p.177 In 1938 he married Jennie Sandin, a Pentecostal minister. He attended Bible school and was also ordained as a Pentecostal minister. In 1944 they moved to Kamloops and he became the leader of Calvary Temple (now St. Andrew's).Standrewssquare.com Phil began the radio program “Chapel in the Sky” and Jennie the “Aunt Jennie” broadcast. Gaglardi continued his weekly 15 minute broadcasts throughout his political career. The Gaglardis had two sons: Bob Gaglardi, founder of Northland Properties (whose holdings include the 60-hotel Sandman Hotel chain and 100-plus restaurants under various labels) whose family is the current owner of the National Hockey League's Dallas Stars, and Bill, a Calgary businessman.\\"Mr. Sandman\\", BC Business online 2007-12-01 Knowtheway.orgKnowtheway.org \\"Testimony of Aunt Jennie\\" Political career Gaglardi was first elected to the legislature in the 1952 election as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) as part of the British Columbia Social Credit League. The party had enough seats to form a minority government, but had no leader. Gaglardi ran for the post, but lost in a vote of caucus members. It was reported that Gaglardi lost by 10 to 9 to W.A.C. Bennett, but according to Bennett's biographer, Bennett received 10 of the 19 votes and Gaglardi one.Mitchell, p.165 He won a total of seven elections and served as a Cabinet minister for the full duration of Bennett's time as Premier. Minister of Highways Gaglardi was appointed Minister of Public Works on the day Bennett's cabinet was sworn into office, August 1, 1952. His office included responsibility for highways. In 1952 Bennett created a new Department of Highways and appointed Gaglardi as the first Minister of Highways. His term was marked by the rapid expansion of the province's paved road system, as well as the completion of most of the major road bridges in British Columbia. Bennett described the building program as \\"the greatest highway building program.per capita in the entire Western world.\\"quoted in Mitchell, p.260 Gaglardi as Minister of Highways was also given responsibility for BC Ferries and its rapid expansion soon after it was nationalized in 1960. He claimed he \\"built the whole system around my own impatience.\\"Mitchell, p.272 What really got him noticed was the way he managed to convince a reluctant W.A.C. Bennett to buy the government a Learjet. Premier Bennett was traveling in a newly inaugurated government-owned ferry to Prince Rupert. To demonstrate that the ferry was too slow for government business, he convinced a pilot friend to fly him to Prince Rupert in a Learjet, thereby managing to get there before Bennett did. Gaglardi waited on the dock to greet the Premier with a purchase contract for the plane. The plane was quickly purchased. (This is not correct, additionally, there is not an airstrip in Prince Rupert). The explanation of Gaglardi's nickname was his propensity for getting speeding tickets whilst driving in large-engined cars around the province checking on the progress of road construction or in his own words \\"testing the curves.\\" When pulled over, Flying Phil would flash his pilot's license saying: He wasn't driving too fast, he was flying too low. In the 1963 provincial general election he defeated Davie Fulton, who had retired from federal politics to head the BC Progressive Conservative Party and chose Kamloops as his preferred entry to the Legislature. It was alleged that in 1968 Gaglardi came under fire in the legislature over re-occurring allegations of preferred highway access to property owned by his sons, use of departmental facilities to provide sign material and construction to benefit their properties, and departmental work performed on his private property.Mitchell, p.373 He announced his resignation in March 1968 after revelations of him having his daughter-in-law and grandson in the government jet. Bennett subsequently let it be known that Gaglardi had been fired', which was not the case.Mitchell, p.373. He continued in Cabinet as Minister without portfolio. The truth is that the plane was on scheduled service to Wichita, Kansas, Gaglardi's daughter-in-law and 3-month-old grandson hitchhiked a ride to Wichita Falls. From which was scheduled to catch a commercial flight to Dallas, Texas in order for her parents to meet her newborn child for the first time. The pilot, on his own accord, felt sympathy for Gaglardi's family and decided to go 20 minutes out of his way to deliver her directly, unknown to Phil. Phil later took full responsibility and resigned from his post. Minister of Social Welfare/Minister of Rehabilitation and Social Improvement In 1969 Gaglardi was appointed to the social welfare portfolio which he renamed the Department of Rehabilitation and Social Improvement. He spoke publicly about \\"deadbeats\\", vowed to become \\"the roughest, toughest, most effective welfare minister the world has ever known\\",Quoted in Mitchell, p.403 and created an agency to assist the indigent in getting jobs. During the 1972 provincial general election, he predicted that Bennett would resign soon after winning the election, accused the premier of being \\"an old man who doesn't understand what is happening with the young people of this province\\", claimed the cabinet was \\"filled with square pegs in round holes\\", and stated, \\"I'm the only real choice for the job.\\"Quoted in Mitchell, p.414 Gaglardi was defeated in the 1972 general election which the Socreds lost to the New Democratic Party. Mayor of Kamloops Phil Gaglardi served as mayor of Kamloops from 1988–1990. He led a fledgling municipal political party called Team Action whose candidates won a majority of the city council.Kamloops News article 2011-04-14 After politics After leaving politics he involved himself in the running of his son's Sandman Inns. In 1978, he seriously considered running for the leadership of the federal Social Credit Party of Canada but later withdrew. Gaglardi died on September 23, 1995. Gaglardi Way, a major thoroughfare in Burnaby, British Columbia connecting the Trans-Canada Highway to Simon Fraser University, is named for him. A statue of Gaglardi was erected in Kamloops.

Nortec music is characterized by hard dance beats and samples from traditional forms of Mexican music such as Banda sinaloense and Norteño - unmistakably Mexican horns are often used. Different individual projects create nortec music. There is also a \\"Colectivo Visual\\": a group of designers and VJs who take care of the visual side of nortec live shows. The term Nortec is a conjunction of norteño (\\"of\\" or \\"from the North\\") and techno, but mainly describes the collision between the music, style and culture of electronic music with those of norteño and tambora, two music genres indigenous to the North of Mexico. These styles are characterized by their use of accordions and double bass (norteño); tubas, clarinets, horns and pumping bass drums (tambora) and quirky use of percussion and polyrhytmic snare drum rolls (both). All of these elements are used to create a sound that is very Tijuana-like. Nortec originated in 1999 when Pepe Mogt started by experimenting with samples of old banda sinaloense and norteño albums and altering them on his computer or filtering them with analog synthesizers. He had picked up on the idea by listening to the percussive and angular grooves of the tambora and norteña music played at a family social event. Through some contacts in recording studios located in Tijuana's notorious Zona Norte red light district, Pepe compiled tracks of isolated instruments from multitrack recording of tambora and norteño demo recordings that had been abandoned at the studios by the bands that recorded them. He began to burn these tracks onto CD-Rs, which he would later distribute to friends under the condition that they make a new track using the material. Those first raw tracks were compiled onto the \\"Nor-tec Sampler\\", the first release from Mil Records followed by the release \\"The Tijuana Sessions Vol. 1\\" and then \\"The Tijuana Sessions Vol. 3\\".

Archived by WebCite at Retrieved on 8 July 2009. Tsafendas, while working as a parliamentary messenger, stabbed Verwoerd to death during a sitting of the House of Assembly in Cape Town. Early life Tsafendas was born in Lourenço Marques (today's Maputo) to Michalis Tsafandakis (Μιχαήλ Τσαφαντάκης, also spelled Miguel Tsafandakis), a Greek marine engineer from Kitharida, a small village near Heraklion, Crete, and Amelia Williams, a Mozambican woman of mixed race. He was sent to Egypt when he was three to live with his grandmother and his aunt.Hollington, Kris. 2008. Wolves, Jackals, and Foxes: The Assassins Who Changed History. New York: Macmillan, p. 116. He returned to Mozambique four years later; then, at the age of ten, moved to Transvaal, where he attended Middelburg Primary School from 1928 to 1930. He then returned to Mozambique and attended a church school for the next two years. Tsafendas was familiar with politics from an early age. Several members of his family were Cretan rebels during the Great Cretan Revolution (1866-1869), while his father was a passionate anarchist. At the age of 16, Tsafendas began to work at various jobs. and was dismissed from one of them “owing to his Communist leanings” and after he was suspected of being “engaged in disseminating Communistic propaganda.\\" When he was 20, the Portuguese security police, PIDE, opened a file on Tsafendas after discovering that he had twice distributed Communist propaganda. In 1939, Tsafendas entered South Africa illegally and joined the South African Communist Party. He became a seaman in the US merchant marine in 1941 and served aboard American ships during the Second World War.Robins, Jon. \\"The Assassin and the Tapeworm,\\" The New Statesman. London. 27 March 2000. While in the United States, Tsafendas became a member of a religious sect known as the Christian Church. In 1947, the US Immigration authorities deported Tsafendas to Greece, which was in the throes of a civil war. Joining the Democratic Army, the military wing of the Greek Communist Party, Tsafendas fought with them against the royalists. Shortly before the war ended in defeat for the Communists, Tsafendas made his way to Portugal. Upon his arrival to the country, he was arrested and interrogated by the police about his political activities in Mozambique in 1938. He was imprisoned for nine months in the two most notorious Portuguese prisons for political offenders, the Barca d’Alva and the Aljuba Prison. In October 1951, Tsafendas travelled by sea to Lourenço Marques, but was refused entry because of his past political activities and for being a known Communist, and was deported back to Portugal. Banned from entering South Africa, where his family had gone to live in the late 1930s, and Mozambique, Tsafendas was forced to spend the next 12 years of his life in exile. Over these years he would apply at least once a year for permission to enter Mozambique or South Africa, but all his applications were refused because of his Communist status and his political activities in Mozambique in the 1930s. Constantly harassed in Portugal by PIDE and the Portuguese police, Tsafendas roamed across Europe and the Middle East, working and visiting places which interested him. Sometimes, when he was down and out, he would claim to be mentally ill so as to secure food and shelter. During his wanderings, he picked up 8 languages. While in Turkey in 1961, he worked for some six months as a teacher of English at the Limasollu Naci College, a prestigious private language institute in Istanbul, and upon eventually securing his return to South Africa, he worked for a time as a translator at Durban Court. In 1962, during a visit to Crete to see his father's and ancestors' birthplace, he met Greek partisans from the Second World War who had participated in the kidnapping of the Nazi General Heinrich Kreipe and they trained him in bomb-making. In 1963, Tsafendas was granted amnesty by the Portuguese after he convinced them that he was a reformed man and no longer a Communist and was eventually allowed to return to Mozambique. A year later, Tsafendas was arrested while addressing local people in favour of independence for the colonial territory. In a suitcase containing anti-colonialist and Communist literature, Tsafendas also had several Bibles. He told the police he was not advocating independence but preaching Christianity. The Portuguese were not convinced and he was charged with “pretending to be a missionary spreading the word about religion,” while actually preaching “under the guise of religion in favour of Mozambique’s independence...” According to PIDE's interrogation transcript, “When asked to describe all of the subversive activities that he has been developing against the Country and in favour of Mozambique’s independence, he answered: That, he hasn’t been developing any kind of such subversive activities against the Country, neither in favour of Mozambique’s independence. However, wishes to clarify that he supports, as a Mozambican, the idea of Mozambique’s independence, governed by the natives of that Province, whether they are black or white.\\" The Portuguese were not convinced that Tsafendas was telling the truth and he was imprisoned. After three months in custody, Tsafendas claimed that he was in fact a missionary, Saint Peter. He was taken to a hospital, where he convinced the Portuguese doctors that he really believed he was Christ’s foremost apostle and he was therefore considered to be insane. He was released from prison custody and soon afterwards released from the hospital. In 1965, Tsafendas returned to South Africa. Shortly before the assassination, he applied for reclassification from \\"White\\" to \\"Coloured\\" but his application was turned down.\\"The Worm Did It\\", The New York Times (book review), 24 June 2001\\"The assassin and the tapeworm\\", by Jon Robins, New Statesman, 27 March 2000 The assassination In July 1966, at the age of forty-eight, Tsafendas obtained a temporary position as a parliamentary messenger in the House of Assembly in Cape Town. When he first decided to take action against Verwoerd, Tsafendas planned to kidnap the prime minister. However, he soon realised that it would be impossible to do this on his own since his former comrades from the SACP were not keen on participating in anything risky or violent. With the access his new job permitted him, he decided instead to assassinate Verwoerd. He believed that since he had the opportunity to act he was morally obliged to do so, believing as he did that Verwoerd was “the brains behind apartheid” and that without him a change of policy would sooner or later take place. Years later, he told two priests who visited him in the hospital, “Every day, you see a man you know committing a very serious crime for which millions of people suffer. You cannot take him to court or report him to the police because he is the law in the country. Would you remain silent and let him continue with his crime or would you do something to stop him? You are guilty not only when you commit a crime, but also when you do nothing to prevent it when you have the chance.\\" Tsafendas's initial plan was to shoot Verwoerd, escape in the confusion, hide in the Eleni, a Greek tanker that was docked in Cape Town, and then sail away with it to freedom. Ultimately, his plan was to seek refuge in Communist Cuba. However, he had difficulty getting hold of a gun and with time running out and his temporary employment about to expire, he decided to use a knife to kill Verwoerd. On 6 September, Prime Minister Verwoerd entered the debating chamber of Parliament and made his way to his seat. Tsafendas approached him, drew a concealed sheath knife from his belt, and stabbed Verwoerd about four times in the torso before he was pulled away by other members of parliament.Morris, Michael and Linnegar, John with the South Africa Ministry of Education, Human Sciences Research Council, Social Cohesion & Integration Research Programme. 2004. Every Step of the Way: the journey to freedom in South Africa. Cape Town: HSRC Press, pp. 184–185. http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/dimitri-tsafendas-0 He had made no plan for escape and was easily apprehended. He was taken into police custody, where he was severely beaten, and then moved to a hospital where he was treated for his injuries and interviewed by a psychiatrist. Later, he was returned to jail pending trial. Throughout his time in custody Tsafendas was subjected to severe torture from beatings, electric shocks, mock hangings and pretended defenestrations. Reaction and police investigation After the assassination, some leaders in the anti-apartheid movement distanced themselves from any association with Tsafendas. However, others like Johnny Makhatini leader of the ANC in Algiers, hailed the assassination as “the beginning of the end for apartheid” and said it would “help the morale of guerrilla fighters in South Africa (and) increase confusion among whites.” Also in Algiers, Nkomo, the representative of the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) said that “the attack... proved the vulnerability of this fascist empire” and Uazuvara Ewald Katjivena, representative of SWAPO (South West African People's Organization) declared that “the fascist Dr. Verwoerd got what he deserved.” Kenya’s Minister of Defence, Dr. Njoroge Mungai, said when he first heard about the stabbing, \\"I hope it is successful. It would be a good thing,\\" and the ruling Kenya African National Union declared that force would be the ultimate method of overthrowing apartheid and characterised the assassination as “a symbolic and heartening act, from which millions suffering from apartheid would draw hope.” People in Nigeria and Uganda danced in the streets with joy when they heard the news of the assassination. The majority of the African press applauded the assassination. For example, the Algerian- French magazine Revolution Africaine applauded the assassination of “the apostle of hatred,” and said, “The most hated man of Africa is no more,” in Ethiopia, a banner headline in the New Times of Addis Ababa said, “The Sharpeville butcher stabbed to death,” while Cairo’s Al Akhbar newspaper said Egypt had “no tears to shed” for Dr. Verwoerd. Tsafendas was disowned by the Christian ChurchAccount of Tsafendas in South Africa before the assassination. Archived by WebCite at Retrieved on 8 July 2009. and by the Greek communities in South Africa and Mozambique. Tsafendas was brutally tortured while he was in custody with electric shocks, beatings, and mock hangings. During his interrogation, Tsafendas gave incontestable political reasons for killing Verwoerd: \\"I did believe that with the disappearance of the South African prime minister a change of policy would take place. I did set myself the task of destroying the prime minister. It was my own idea to kill him. No one offered me any reward for doing so. I did not care about the consequences, for what would happen to me afterwards. I was so disgusted with the racial policy that I went through with my plans to kill the prime minister.... I wanted to see a government representing all the South African people. I do not think the Nationalist government is representative of the people and I wanted to see a different government.” At the same time, the Portuguese security police, embarrassed that Tsafendas, a Portuguese citizen with a long history of political activism in Mozambique who had also fooled them into granting him amnesty by pretending he was no longer a communist and or an anticolonialist, had assassinated Verwoerd, moved quickly to hide their discomfort. Two days after the assassination, the Chief Inspector of PIDE in Lisbon instructed his counterparts in Mozambique not to give the South African authorities “any information indicating Tsafendas as a partisan for the independence of your province [country]”. The PIDE in Mozambique thus lied and misled the South African police as to Tsafendas's past political activities. Despite PIDE's efforts, the South African police investigation, led by the notorious General Hendrik van den Bergh, revealed that Tsafendas was a highly intelligent man, well versed in politics, well read, with deep political convictions and a lifelong history of activism who considered Verwoerd to be a dictator and a tyrant. He even constantly characterised Dr. Verwoerd as \\"Hitler's best student,\\" as he believed the South African Prime Minister had copied some of Hitler's Nuremberg Laws and applied them to the blacks in his country. He had been banned from entering South Africa for his political activities and beliefs and the South African security police held four files on him. A year before the assassination, two people had reported Tsafendas to the South African police as a dangerous Communist, and one of them had even characterised him as “the biggest communist in the Republic of South Africa.” Edward Furness, a South African who had met Tsafendas in London, told the police that Tsafendas closely associated with prominent members of the anti- apartheid movement in London and that he had admitted to him that he wanted \\"to create a resistance to the regime of South Africa\\" and that he was willing to do “anything that would get the South African regime out of power.” Evidence was also submitted to the Commission of Enquiry into Verwoerd's death that in London, Tsafendas had attempted to “recruit people to take part in an uprising in South Africa.” None of those documents, along with anything that had to do with Tsafendas's political ideas and activism, was allowed to see the light of day.  Trial  At his trial, Judge Andries Beyers declared Tsafendas not guilty of murder by reason of insanity.Bell, Terry Bell and Ntsebeza, Dumisa Buhle. 2003.

He had been diagnosed as being schizophrenic and it was claimed by police and his defence that he had said that he had a giant tapeworm inside him, which affected his life.\\"The Tapeworm Murder\\", Time Magazine. 28 October 1966. The court ordered for him to be detained \\"at the pleasure of the State President\\", which meant that only the State President (later President) had the authority to order his release.Dyzenhaus, David. 1998. Judging the Judges, Judging Ourselves: truth, reconciliation and the apartheid legal order Oxford: Hart Publishing, p. 43. He was never discharged. However the diagnosis of mental illness has since been dismissed by several forensic psychiatrists. Those who examined Tsafendas during the trial based their diagnoses entirely on what Tsafendas told them and had no access to any other information about him: his medical and criminal records and statements by people who knew him. Thus, they formed their opinions after they had each spent four-and-a-half hours with only Tsafendas, took for granted what he told them and had no way of double-checking it. During the trial, no mention was made of Tsafendas's political activism, real political ideas or his motive for killing Verwoerd, as had clearly been expressed by him to the police. The fact that he had given lucid political reasons for killing Verwoerd in his two statements to the police, with no reference to the tapeworm, was concealed at the trial. The Attorney General lied, withheld and manipulated evidence to portray Tsafendas as an apolitical schizophrenic who had killed Verwoerd for no political reason. A subsequent Commission of Enquiry into the assassination also withheld and manipulated evidence, which was clearly to portray Tsafendas as he had been presented in court.  Imprisonment  Zonderwater Prison Tsafendas was initially held on Robben Island, then after four months was transferred to Pretoria Central Prison. There he occupied a cell on death row that was specially built for him next to the execution chamber where men were hanged. Tsafendas was subjected to some form of inhuman and cruel torture for most of his imprisonment. In 1989, he was transferred to Zonderwater Prison near Cullinan. In 1994, and after apartheid had collapsed, Tsafendas was visited in prison by two Greek Orthodox priests he already knew and told them that he killed Verwoerd because he was \\"a dictator and a tyrant who oppressed his people.\\" Tsafendas attempted to justify the assassination and told them: “Every day, you see a man you know committing a very serious crime for which millions of people suffer. You cannot take him to court or report him to the police, because he is the law in the country. Would you remain silent and let him continue with his crime, or would you do something to stop him?” In 1994, he was transferred again, this time to Sterkfontein psychiatric hospital outside Krugersdorp. In 1999, South African filmmaker Liza Key was allowed to conduct two televised interviews with him, for a documentary called A Question of Madness in which she raised the suggestion that Tsafendas's act was not mindless but politically motivated. Death Tsafendas, at the age of 81,Obituaries: \\"Dimitri Tsafendas; S. African Assassin\\", The Los Angeles Times. 8 October 1999 died of pneumonia in October 1999, 33 years after the assassination. At the time of his death, he was not regarded as a hero in anti-apartheid circles, which sent no members to attend his funeral. The funeral was held according to Greek Orthodox rites, and he was buried in an unmarked grave outside Sterkfontein Hospital.van Woerden, Henk (translated by Dan Jacobson). 2002. The Assassin: a story of race and rage in the land of apartheid. New York: Macmillan. pp. 159–163. Fewer than ten people attended the service.  Report to the Minister of Justice regarding Verwoerd's assassination  On 23 April 2018, a document entitled “Report to the Minister of Justice, advocate Tshilio Michael Masutha, in the Matter of Dr Verwoerd’s Assassination” was submitted to the Minister of Justice of South Africa Michael Masutha by Judge Jody Kollapen. The report was written by Harris Dousemetzis, a tutor at Durham University, England, and consisted of three hardback volumes totalling 2,192 pages and 861,803 words. It was accompanied by a 16GB USB that contained all the evidence gathered by the author for this research, including about 12,000 pages of documents located in the National Archives of South Africa, Portugal and England, 137 interviews, including 69 with people who knew Tsafendas personally, some of them well and even as a child, as well as thousands of newspaper articles. Dousemetzis collaborated closely in his research and the evaluation of the evidence with Advocate George Bizos, Professor John Dugard, former KwaZulu-Natal state attorney Krish Govender, Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza and former Judge Zak Yacoob, while he also consulted Professor Alban Burke, Head of the Department of Psychology at the University of Johannesburg; Professor Kirk Heilbrun, forensic psychologist and Professor of Psychology at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Professor Phillip Resnick, forensic psychiatrist and Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Division of Forensic Psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio; Professor Robert L. Sadoff, clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Director of the Center for Studies in Social-Legal Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, and former president of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, as well as of the American Board of Forensic Psychiatry, and Professor Tuviah Zabow, forensic psychiatrist, former head of the forensic psychiatry unit at Valkenberg Hospital and former Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Cape Town. The Report and the evidence were supported by a joint letter from Bizos, Dugard, Govender, Ntsebeza and Yacoob. They wrote that the new evidence “shows convincingly that Mr Tsafendas was not a schizophrenic who believed that his actions were determined by a tapeworm. In fact, the study compellingly demonstrates that he was a man with a deep social conscience who was bitterly opposed to apartheid and viewed Verwoerd as the prime architect of this policy. Tsafendas told the police after the assassination that he killed Dr Verwoerd because he was ‘disgusted with his racial policies’ and hoped that ‘a change of policy would take place’. The killing of Verwoerd was therefore a political assassination and not the act of an insane man.” The five jurists concluded in their letter that: Advocate George Bizos characterised the report as “monumental” and described it as “the most comprehensive study of apartheid and how it operated that I have ever seen.” He expressed his belief that the Report is “of major historical importance for South Africa and as to our understanding of Verwoerd’s assassination.” Advocate Bizos described the evidence gathered and presented by the Report, proving that Tsafendas was not insane but politically motivated in killing Dr. Verwoerd, as “overwhelming and unquestionable.\\" Professor John Dugard stated of the Report that it “confirms that there was a cover-up. It shows convincingly that Tsafendas was a political revolutionary, whose assassination of Dr Verwoerd was motivated by a hatred of Dr Verwoerd and all he stood for. He was not an insane killer but a political assassin determined to rid South Africa of the architect of apartheid. Political assassinations seldom achieve their goal and this was no exception. But at least South African history should know the truth about Tsafendas. Dousemetzis has done South Africa a service by correcting the historical record.” Justice Zak Yacoob said he agreed “100 per cent” with all of the Report's findings and added: “The historical record shows that comrade Tsafendas killed Verwoerd, that he pleaded insanity at the trial, his plea was upheld and he was, consequent to his plea, confined at the pleasure of the relevant authority. If he had spoken the truth, he would have been sentenced to death, so the tactic was a very good one in the circumstances. History does not record that he pretended to be insane to save his life. This is well brought out in the research. The research shows conclusively that he did a deliberate courageous anti-apartheid act but pretended insanity at the trial; understandably so. I think the research speaks for itself.\\" On 24 April 2018, Solly Mapaila, First Deputy General Secretary of the South African Communist Party, made a similar request to the Minister of Justice on behalf of his Party: “We hereby request that the Minister assesses and considers the new evidence, based on research by Mr Harris Dousemetzis, on the assassination of Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd and that the act be classified as politically motivated.” In popular culture In 1976, Bill Turner wrote and staged in England and South Africa a play simply titled Tsafendas. In 1998, Dutch author Henk van Woerden, who visited Tsafendas in hospital towards the end of Tsafendas's life, published the award-winning memoir, A Mouthful of Glass. An award-winning play entitled Living in Strange Lands by Anton Krueger was presented to South African audiences in 2002. A London production entitled I.D. was written by the noted Shakespearean actor Antony Sher, who lived in Cape Town at the time of the incident. I.D. premiered at the Almeida Theatre in London in 2003, followed by an American debut in 2005.Carter, Alice T. \\"Musings of 'I.D.' Offer Intellectual Exercise,\\" Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, 24 May 2005. Tsafendas's life story and assassination of Hendrik Verwoerd were briefly mentioned in the book The Girl Who Saved the King of Sweden by Jonas Jonasson published in 2012. In November 2018, Tsafendas's first comprehensive biography by Harris Dousemetzis and Gerry Loughran, The Man Who Killed Apartheid: The Life of Dimitri Tsafendas was published in South Africa. Justice and Correctional Services Minister Michael Masutha described the book's launch as \\"a moment to celebrate the truth\\" about Tsafendas.

He is best known for preserving the peace in 1862 when the British cabinet debated intervention into the American Civil War. Proponents such as Chancellor of the Exchequer William Gladstone, Foreign Minister Russell and Prime Minister Palmerston favoured the Confederacy. They worried about the danger of an extremely bloody race war in the United States, and wanted to restore the supply of urgently needed raw cotton for the Lancashire textile industry. Lewis was a strong opponent, warning that there were very high risks to British interests. His views finally prevailed and the British remained neutral throughout the Civil War.Howard Jones, Blue & Gray Diplomacy: A History of Union and Confederate Foreign Relations (2010). Family He was born in London, the son of Thomas Frankland Lewis of Harpton Court, Radnorshire and his wife Harriet Cornewall. Thomas, after holding subordinate office in various administrations, became a poor-law commissioner, and was made a baronet in 1846. His maternal grandparents were Sir George Cornewall, 2nd Baronet and Catherine Cornewall, daughter of Velters Cornewall. Education Lewis was educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1828 he earned a first-class in classics and a second-class in mathematics. He then entered the Middle Temple, and was called to the bar in 1831. Inquiry into Ireland In 1833 he undertook his first public work as one of the commissioners to inquire into the condition of the poor Irish residents in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1834 Lord Althorp included him in the commission to inquire into the state of church property and church affairs in Ireland. To this fact we owe his work on Local Disturbances in Ireland, and the Irish Church Question (London, 1836), in which he condemned the existing connection between church and state, proposed a state provision for the Catholic clergy, and maintained the necessity of an efficient workhouse organization. Linguistics During this period Lewis's mind was occupied with the study of language. Before leaving college he had published some observations on Richard Whately's doctrine of the predicables, and soon afterward he assisted Connop Thirlwall and Julius Charles Hare in starting the Philological Museum. Its successor was the Classical Museum which he also supported \\"by occasional contributions. In 1835 he published an Essay on the Origin and Formation of the Romance Languages (re-edited in 1862), the first effective criticism in United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland of François Juste Marie Raynouard's theory of a uniform romance tongue, represented by the poetry of the troubadours. He also compiled a glossary of provincial words used in Herefordshire and the adjoining counties. But the most important work of this earlier period was one to which his logical and philological tastes contributed. The Remarks on the Use and Abuse of some Political Terms (London, 1832) may have been suggested by Jeremy Bentham's Book of Parliamentary Fallacies, but it shows all that power of clear, original thinking which marks his larger and later political works. Translations and reports Moreover, he translated Philipp August Böckh's Public Economy of Athens and Muller's History of Greek Literature, and he assisted Henry Tufnell in the translation of Müller's Dorians. Some time afterward he edited a text of the Fables of Babrius. While his friend Abraham Hayward conducted the Law Magazine, he wrote in it frequently on such subjects as secondary punishments and the penitentiary system. In 1836, at the request of Charles Grant, 1st Baron Glenelg, he accompanied John and Sarah Austin to Malta, where they spent nearly two years reporting on the condition of the island and framing a new code of laws. One leading object of both commissioners was to associate the Maltese in the responsible government of the island. On his return to Britain, Lewis succeeded his father as one of the principal poor-law commissioners. The Essay on the Government of Dependencies appeared in 1841, a systematic statement and discussion of the various relations in which colonies may stand towards the mother country. Marriage Kent House, Knightsbridge In 1844 Lewis married Lady Maria Theresa Villiers, a lady of literary tastes. She was a daughter of George Villiers and Theresa Parker and younger sister of George Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon. She was the widow of novelist Thomas Henry Lister and mother of three children by her previous marriage. Much of their married life was spent in Kent House, Knightsbridge. They had no children. His wife and her family promoted Lewis's career.D. A. Smith, ‘Lewis , Lady (Maria) Theresa (1803–1865)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 accessed 28 Dec 2014 Government positions In 1847 Lewis resigned his office. He was then returned for the county of Hereford, and Lord John Russell appointed him Secretary to the Board of Control, but a few months afterward he became Under-Secretary of State for Home Affairs. In this capacity he introduced two important bills, one for the abolition of turnpike trusts and the management of highways by a mixed county board, the other for the purpose of defining and regulating the law of parochial assessment. In 1850 he succeeded Hayter as Financial Secretary to the Treasury. About this time, his Essay on the Influence of Authority in Matters of Opinion was published. From 1853 to 1854 he sat on Royal Commission on the City of London. Magazine editor On the dissolution of parliament which followed the resignation of Lord John Russell's ministry in 1852, Lewis sought re-election in the 1852 United Kingdom general election. He was defeated for Herefordshire and then for Peterborough. Excluded from parliament he accepted the editorship of the Edinburgh Review, and remained editor until 1855. During this period he served on the Oxford commission, and on the commission to inquire into the government of London. But its chief fruits were the Treatise on the Methods of Observation and Reasoning in Politics, and the Enquiry into the Credibility of the Early Roman History, in which he vigorously attacked the theory of epic lays and other theories on which Barthold Georg Niebuhr's reconstruction of that history was based. Return to government In 1855 Lewis succeeded his father in the baronetcy. He was at once elected member for the Radnor boroughs, and Lord Palmerston made him Chancellor of the Exchequer. He had a war loan to contract and heavy additional taxation to impose, but his industry, method and clear vision carried him safely through. After the change of ministry in 1859 Sir George became Home Secretary under Lord Palmerston, and in 1861, much against his wish, he succeeded Sidney Herbert (Lord Herbert of Lea) at the War Office. In that role he successfully argued against Russell's call for British mediation in the American Civil War in the autumn of 1862. Final works In 1859 he published the Essay on Foreign Jurisdiction and the Extradition of Criminals, a subject to which the attempt on Napoleon III's life, the discussions on the Conspiracy Bill, and the trial of Bernard, had drawn general attention. He advocated the extension of extradition treaties, and condemned the principal idea of Weltrechtsordnung which Professor Robert von Mohl of Heidelberg had proposed. His two final works were the Survey of the Astronomy of the Ancients, in which, without professing any knowledge of Oriental languages, he applied a sceptical analysis to the ambitious Egyptology of Bunsen; and the Dialogue on the Best Form of Government, in which, under the name of Crito, the author points out to the supporters of the various systems that there is no one abstract government which is the best possible for all times and places. An essay on the Characteristics of Federal, National, Provincial and Municipal Government does not seem to have been published. Legacy Monument near New Radnor A marble bust of Sir George, by Weekes, stands in Westminster Abbey. A large monument was built in memory of Sir George Cornewall Lewis in the small village of New Radnor, Powys after he died and still stands today, as does a statue in front of the Shirehall in Hereford. Lewis's large circle of friends included Sir E. Head, the Grotes, the Austins, Lord Stanhope, John Stuart Mill, Dean Milman, and the Duff Gordons. In public life he was described by Lord Aberdeen as notable \\"for candour, moderation, love of truth\\". According to Geoffrey Madan, although invited by Queen Victoria each year to stay at Balmoral, he never accepted.J.A.Gere and John Sparrow (ed.), Geoffrey Madan's Notebooks, Oxford University Press, 1981 Historian Richard Shannon argued that had Lewis lived he and not William Ewart Gladstone might have come to lead the Liberal PartyRichard Shannon, 'The virtues of unheroic government: the counterfactual case for Sir George Cornewall Lewis', The Transactions of the Radnorshire Society Vol 81: 2011 References * * * External links * *A genealogical profile of his father *A listing of his ancestral Cornwall family Category:Chancellors of the Exchequer of the United Kingdom Category:British Secretaries of State Category:UK MPs 1847–1852 Category:UK MPs 1852–1857 Category:UK MPs 1857–1859 Category:UK MPs 1859–1865 Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for Welsh constituencies Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Members of The Club Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:British political writers Category:British classical scholars Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:Writers from London Category:1806 births Category:1863 deaths ","title":"George Cornewall Lewis"},{"id":"310510","text":"John Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl Spencer, (30 May 1782 – 1 October 1845), styled Viscount Althorp from 1783 to 1834, was a British statesman. He was Chancellor of the Exchequer under Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne from 1830 to 1834. Due to his reputation for integrity he was nicknamed \\"Honest Jack\\". Early years His father George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer had served in the ministries of Pitt the Younger, Charles James Fox and Lord Grenville, and was First Lord of the Admiralty (1794–1801). He was married to the eldest daughter of Lord Lucan. Their eldest son, John Charles, was born at Spencer House, London, on 30 May 1782. In 1800, after Harrow, he took up his residence at Trinity College, Cambridge, and for some time applied himself energetically to mathematical studies; but he spent most of his time in hunting and racing. He was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Northamptonshire on 5 June 1803. In 1804, he entered parliament as a member for Okehampton in Devon. He vacated his seat in 1806, to contest the University of Cambridge against Lord Henry Petty and Lord Palmerston (when he was hopelessly beaten), but he was elected that same year for St Albans, and appointed a lord of the treasury. At the general election in November 1806, he was elected for Northamptonshire, and he continued to sit for the county until he succeeded to the peerage. For the next few years after this speech Lord Althorp occasionally spoke in debate and always on the side of Liberalism, but from 1813 to 1818 he was only rarely in the House of Commons. His absence was partly due to a feeling that it was hopeless to struggle against the will of the Tory ministry, but more particularly because of the death of his wife. Leader of the Commons In 1819, on his return to political life, he pressed for establishing a more efficient bankruptcy court, and of expediting the recovery of small debts; and he saw both these reforms accomplished before 1825. During the greater part of the reign of George IV the Whigs lost their influence in the state from their want of cohesion, but this defect was soon remedied in 1830 when Lord Althorp was chosen their leader in the lower house, and his capacity for the position was proved by experience. In Lord Grey's government Althorp was both Leader of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Exchequer. He was instrumental in success of the government measures. Along with Lord John Russell, he led the fight to pass the Reform Bill of 1832, making more than twenty speeches, and is generally considered the architect of its victory. The Lords After the dissolution of 1833, the Whig government had been slowly dying, and was further weakened by Althorp's promotion to the House of Lords following the death of his father in 1834. The new Lord Spencer abandoned the cares of office and returned to country life with unalloyed delight. Henceforth agriculture, not politics, was his principal interest. He was the first president of the Royal Agricultural Society (founded 1838), and a notable cattle-breeder. Though often urged by his political friends to come to their assistance, he rarely quit the peaceful pleasures which he loved. He died without issue at Wiseton on 1 October 1845, and was succeeded by his brother Frederick (d. 1857). Reputation and legacy The Whigs required, to carry the Reform Bill, a leader above party spirit. \\"Honest Jack Althorp\\" has been called \\"the most decent man who ever held high Government office\\". Although he was not a particularly good public speaker, his integrity was an invaluable asset to the Government. Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge said that one of John Wilson Croker's speeches was demolished by the simple statement of Lord Althorp that he \\"had collected some figures which entirely refuted it, but had lost them.\\" To Croker's credit, he replied that he would never doubt Althorp's word. Spencer Street in Melbourne, is named in his honour. Marriage Spencer married on 13 April 1814 to Esther Acklom (September 1788 – 11 June 1818) at Upper Brook Street, Mayfair, London. Cokayne quotes from the Farington Diaries, \\"in marrying He complied with the wishes of Lord and Lady Spencer, it was not of His own seeking\\" and from the Letter Bag of Lady Elizabeth Spencer-Stanhope, \\"since Jack Althorp would not propose to her, she proposed to him; and such an unusual proceeding was fraught with happy consequences ... his devotion after marriage amply compensated for his lack of ardour before.\\" Esther died on 11 June 1818 at the age of 29 at Halkin Street, Belgravia, London, England, in childbirth and she was buried on 18 June 1818 in Brington, Northampshire, England. John was said to be deeply upset by his wife's death and was devoted to her memory for the rest of his life: he resolved never to remarry, and it is said that he gave up hunting, his favourite pastime, to mark the depth of his loss.

Born in Paris as the son of a prominent diplomat, Stanhope pursued a military career. Although he also served in Flanders and Italy, he is best remembered for his service in Portugal and Spain during the War of the Spanish Succession. He was the first British Governor of Minorca, which he captured from the Spanish in 1708. In 1710 he commanded the British contingent of the Allied Army which occupied Madrid having won a decisive victory at the Battle of Zaragoza. Having then evacuated the Spanish capital, Stanhope's rearguard on the retreat to Barcelona were overwhelmed and forced to surrender at Brihuega. Paroled, he returned to Britain and pursued a political career as a Whig. A supporter of the Hanoverian Succession he was rewarded with office by George I in 1714. As Southern Secretary he oversaw the negotiation of an Anglo-French Alliance. Emerging as the dominant figure in government after 1717, following the Whig Split, he led Britain to success in a new Spanish War and suppressed a Jacobite Rising in 1719. However the government was overtaken by the collapse of the South Sea Bubble and he died in office. He is occasionally mentioned as an alternative candidate to Robert Walpole as Britain's first Prime Minister.Pearce p.1 Background and education Stanhope was born in Paris in 1673, the eldest of the seven children of Alexander Stanhope (1638–1707), and his wife Katherine (died 1718), the daughter and co-heir of Arnold Burghill, of Thinghall Parva, Withington, Herefordshire, by his second wife Grizell, co-heir of John Prise of Ocle Pyrchard, Herefordshire. He was educated at Eton College and at Trinity College, Oxford, where he matriculated in May 1688. Early political and military career Stanhope accompanied his father, then English Ambassador to Madrid, to Spain in 1690, and obtained some knowledge of that country which was very useful to him in later life. Flanders Campaigns A little later he went to Italy where, as afterwards in Flanders, he served as a volunteer against France, and in 1695 he secured a commission in the English army. In 1701 Stanhope entered the House of Commons, but he continued his career as a soldier and was in Spain and Portugal during the earlier stages of the War of the Spanish Succession. Spanish Campaigns Cadiz During the opening stages of the war he was in Ireland on recruiting duty. He desperately sought a chance of combat, and was given permission to accompany the Duke of Ormonde's expedition to Cadiz.Williams. Stanhope. p.26 The attempt to capture Cadiz failed, but the expedition enjoyed success on the return journey at the Battle of Vigo Bay. Portugal In 1703 he served with the Duke of Marlborough's Army in the Low Countries, having arrived too late to take part in the Siege of Bonn.Williams. Stanhope p.31-32 His regiment was then transferred to Lisbon. Due to Portugal's entry into the war on the Allied side, a large British continent was sent to assist them. While Stanhope was in Lisbon recovering from an attack of fever his regiment was part of a Portuguese-commanded garrison which surrendered the town of Portalegre.Williams. Stanhope. p.34 Barcelona In 1705 he served in Spain under Charles Mordaunt, Earl of Peterborough, notably at the Siege of Barcelona and in 1706 he was appointed English minister in Spain, but his duties were still military as well as diplomatic, and in 1708, after some differences with Peterborough, who favoured defensive measures only, he was made commander-in-chief of the British forces in that country. Minorca Archduke Charles of Austria on the Spanish throne Taking the offensive he captured Port Mahon, Minorca. During the operation his younger brother Philip Stanhope, a naval officer, was killed. Madrid campaign After a visit to England in which he took part in the impeachment of Henry Sacheverell, he returned to Spain for the campaign of 1710, with Allied victories at Almenar and Saragossa in July and August enabling Archduke Charles to enter Madrid in September. On the back of these triumphs, Stanhope was selected as Whig candidate for the Westminster seat in the 1710 General Election, with his cousin Lt-General Sherington Davenport as proxy in his absence. Defeat Unlike many constituencies, Westminster had a relatively large electorate of over 10,000 and its proximity to both Court and Parliament meant the result often influenced others. Almenar was used to promote 'brave, virtuous Stanhope' but his Tory opponent Thomas Crosse easily won the seat aided by the satirist Jonathan Swift who published thinly disguised accusations of Stanhope's homosexuality. The Tories won the General election in December by a landslide, by which time Stanhope was a prisoner in Spain but this theme was to form an important part of his future image. Lack of support from the local population meant the Allies entered an almost deserted Madrid and were effectively isolated when Portuguese forces were prevented from crossing into Spain. In November, the Allies left Madrid for Catalonia in separate detachments, one of 5,000 under Stanhope and the second of 12,000 under the Austrian Starhemberg. Stanhope's division was taken by surprise and forced to surrender by a French army led by Louis Joseph, Duke of Vendôme at Brihuega on 9 December 1710. The next day Vendôme followed this up by defeating Starhemberg at Villaviciosa; these defeats were a devastating setback to Allied ambitions in Spain.Holmes p.356-357 Although Allied forces continued to operate out of Catalonia, British commitment to the war was already waning under the new Tory government and Stanhope's replacement as British commander in Spain the Duke of Argyll took no offensive action. Of great significance was the death of Emperor Joseph I in April 1711 which meant Archduke Charles became Emperor Charles VI. This caused Britain to withdraw from the war since a Spanish and Austrian union threatened the European balance of power, and was as unwelcome as a French one. Philip V retained the Spanish throne, although lost many of Spain's traditional territories. Later Stanhope would admit to Queen Anne that he believed that the Spanish campaign was flawed in its general strategy, and even with more troops deployed there would struggle given the general preference of the Spanish population for Philip over Charles.Williams. Stanhope p.118 Most of the prisoners taken at Brihuega were quickly exchanged but Stanhope himself remained a prisoner in Spain and only returned to England in August 1712, coming via Paris where he encountered the Tory politician Henry St. John who was there negotiating a peace treaty with France.Williams. Stanhope p.121 Political career, 1712–1721 Once back in Britain he now abandoned his military career and moved wholly into politics. He soon sat for another seat, Wendover, and became one of the leaders of the Whig opposition in the House of Commons to Robert Harley's Tory administration. In particular he opposed the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht by which Britain unilaterally made peace with France and abandoned its allies. He was a staunch supporter of the House of Hanover. Once George I succeeded to the throne following the death of Queen Anne in 1714, he replaced the Tory government with a largely Whig one. Several senior Tories were either imprisoned or fled into exile due to their perceived support of the Jacobite James Stuart. Secretary of State In September 1714 he was appointed Secretary of State for the Southern Department. With Walpole he provided the leadership of the House of Commons. In early 1715 the new government's position was secured when it won a decisive election victory.Williams. Stanhope p.169 He was mainly responsible for the measures which were instrumental in crushing the Jacobite rising of 1715. He forwarded the passing of the Septennial Act in 1716 that established that general elections should be held every seven years. In July 1716 he accompanied George I on his return to Hanover.Williams. Stanhope p.200 He acted as George I's foreign minister, and only just failed to conclude a treaty of alliance with France in 1716. In 1717 there was a dramatic schism in the Whig Party with Stanhope and Sunderland forming one grouping while Walpole and Townshend opposed them. Walpole led his supporters into opposition, coinciding with a similar dispute within the royal family between George I and his son George, Prince of Wales. This Whig Split divided the dominant Whig movement for three years. Emergence as First Minister 1718 portrait by Johan van Diest. In 1717, consequent on changes in the ministry, Stanhope was made First Lord of the Treasury, and was the last Chancellor of the Exchequer to sit in the House of Lords. A year later he returned to his former office of secretary for the southern department. On 3 July 1717, he was created Baron Stanhope of Elvaston and Viscount Stanhope of Mahon and, on 14 April 1718, Earl Stanhope. He was in all but name Prime Minister and is sometimes presented as the first Prime Minister of Great Britain, rather than Sir Robert Walpole who is more usually considered as that figure. War of the Quadruple Alliance He saw Britain's principal foreign policy goals as containing the threat of Spanish, Austrian or Russian expansionist tendencies. His activity was now shown in the conclusion of the Quadruple Alliance between Britain, France, Austria and the United Provinces in 1718, and in obtaining peace for Sweden, when threatened by Russia and Denmark. He entered delicate negotiations with Spain which wished for the return of Gibraltar, which he was only prepared to do in exchange for Cuba and Florida. Ultimately the talks broke down, setting the path to the later Thirteenth Siege of Gibraltar. In the ensuing War of the Quadruple Alliance British forces were involved in a campaign to prevent Spanish expansion in Italy. Spain landed troops in Scotland in support of the Jacobites who they hoped to restore to the throne. The expedition was defeated at the Battle of Glen Shiel and in retaliation the British dispatched a force that briefly captured Vigo in October 1719. In the wake of these setbacks Spain agreed to the Treaty of The Hague the following year. Domestically, he promoted the Peerage Bill of 1719 to limit the membership of the House of Lords a controversial move as it was seen as an attack directed at his former Whig colleagues led by Walpole. His attempts at pushing for greater religious toleration were defeated by Walpole's supporters.Pearce p.87-89 South Sea Bubble Just after the collapse of the South Sea Bubble, for which he was partly responsible but from which he did not profit, the earl was defending his government with customary vigour and panache in House of Lords on 4 February 1721 when he was taken ill with a violent headache. After some apparent recovery the following day, he died of a stroke at eight o'clock that evening. The king was shocked and distraught at the sudden \\"loss of so able and faithful a minister, of whose service his Majesty had so great need at this critical juncture\\".A. Newman, The Stanhopes of Chevening (1969), p. 99. On the king's orders Stanhope was given a full military funeral through London on 17 February to Southwark, and he was afterwards privately buried at Chevening. He was succeeded by his eldest son Philip (1714–1786), a distinguished mathematician and a fellow of the Royal Society. Reputation Basil Williams said Stanhope, \\"had no special bent for domestic politics.... His impetuosity and want of experience indeed led him into mistakes sometimes in dealing with internal questions.\\" However, Williams goes on to argue that: :On the other hand, in foreign politics his comprehensive grasp of European conditions and of England's essential interests, his tact and self-control in dealings with foreign allies or opponents, and the blunt honesty of his diplomacy gave him an ascendancy rarely equaled by any of our foreign ministers. This ascendancy was the more remarkable since it had peace alone as its object and its result. The long epoch of comparative security in external relations which enabled Walpole quietly to consolidate the country's internal prosperity on a sound basis was mainly due to Stanhope's achievement in foreign policy.Basil Williams, The Whig Supremacy: 17141760 (2nd ed. 1962) p 169. Family On 24 February 1713, Stanhope married Lucy Pitt (1692–1723), a younger daughter of Thomas Pitt, the first governor of Madras, and aunt to William Pitt the Elder. Although Stanhope found little time for domesticity, it was a happy union, and the couple had seven children, including two sets of twins: three of those children were not for him *Philip Stanhope, 2nd Earl Stanhope (1714–1786) *Lady Lucy Stanhope (15 August 171415 May 1785) *Lt-Col Hon.

He served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (1714–1717), Lord Privy Seal (1715–1716), Lord President of the Council (1717–1719) and First Lord of the Treasury (1718–1721). Early life He was the second son of Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland and Anne Digby, daughter of George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol. On the death of his elder brother Robert in Paris in September 1688, he became heir to the peerage. Called by John Evelyn \\"a youth of extraordinary hopes,\\" he completed his education at Utrecht, and in 1695 entered the House of Commons as member for Tiverton. In the same year, he married Arabella, daughter of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle; she died in 1698 and in 1700, he married Anne Churchill, daughter of John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough. This was an important alliance for Sunderland and for his descendants; through it he was introduced to political life and later the dukedom of Marlborough came to the Spencers. In 1698 he plunged his family into scandal when his brother-in- law Donogh MacCarthy, 4th Earl of Clancarty, who had been imprisoned in the Tower of London for his support for James II and later escaped, was reconciled with his long-estranged wife, Charles' sister Elizabeth, and at long last consummated the marriage. Charles, alerted by his father's servants, had Clancarty arrested while he was actually in bed with Elizabeth. The result was a public uproar which gravely embarrassed their parents. William III treated the matter as a trifle, wondering why everyone he met teased him about \\"that little spark Clancarty\\", and gave the couple permission to settle in Altona, Hamburg. Elizabeth, who died in Hamburg in 1704, never saw her parents or brother again. His father's biographer comments that the affair did not show Charles in a good light either as a man or a brother.Kenyon, J.P Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland 1641-1702 Gregg Revivals reprint 1992 p. 309 Career Having succeeded to the peerage in 1702, Sunderland was one of the commissioners for the union between England and Scotland, and in 1705, he was sent to Vienna as envoy extraordinary. Although he was tinged with republican ideas and had made himself obnoxious to Queen Anne by opposing the grant to her husband, Prince George, through the influence of Marlborough he was foisted into the ministry as Secretary of State for the Southern Department, taking office in December 1706. From 1708 to 1710, he was one of the five Whigs collectively called the Junto, who dominated the government, but he had many enemies, the Queen still disliked him, and in June 1710, he was dismissed. Anne offered him a pension of £3000 a year, but this he refused, saying \\"if he could not have the honour to serve his country he would not plunder it.\\" When Marlborough protested about the dismissal, the Queen inquired sarcastically whether \\"the Peace of Europe must depend on it?\\" She added that Sunderland was universally unpopular, which was indeed the case.Gregg, Edward Queen Anne Yale University Press 1980 p. 314 Sunderland continued to take part in public life, and was active in communicating with the court of Hanover about the steps to be taken in view of the approaching death of the queen. He made the acquaintance of George I in 1706, but when the elector became king, Sunderland only secured the comparatively unimportant position of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. In August 1715, he joined the cabinet as Lord Privy Seal. After a visit to George I in Hanover, he secured in April 1717 the position of Secretary of State for the Northern Department. This he retained until March 1718, when he became First Lord of the Treasury, holding also the post of Lord President of the Council. He was now effectively the prime minister. Sunderland was especially interested in the proposed Peerage Bill, a measure designed to limit the number of members of the House of Lords, but this was defeated owing partly to the opposition of Sir Robert Walpole. In 1719 he was one of the main subscribers in the Royal Academy of Music (1719), a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage.Deutsch, O.E. (1955), Handel. A documentary biography, p. 91. Reprint 1974.See the year 1719 Handel Reference Database (in progress) The bursting of the South Sea Bubble led to his political ruin. He had taken some part in launching the scheme of 1720, therefore public opinion was roused against him and it was only through the efforts of Walpole that he was acquitted by the House of Commons, when the matter was investigated. In April 1721, he resigned his offices, but he retained his influence with George I until his own death on 19 April 1722. Sunderland inherited his father's passion for intrigue, while his manners were repelling, but he stands high among his associates for disinterestedness and had an alert and discerning mind. From his early years he had a great love of books, and he spent his leisure and his wealth in forming the library at Althorp, which in 1703 was described as \\"the finest in Europe.\\" In 1749 part of it was removed to Blenheim Palace. Sunderland's second wife died in April 1716, after a career of considerable influence on the political life of her time. In 1717, he married an Irish lady of fortune, Judith Tichborne (d. 1749), daughter of Sir Benjamin Tichborne (younger brother of Sir Henry Tichborne, 1st Baron Ferrard, Irish cr. 1715) and Elizabeth Gibbs. She later married Sir Robert Sutton. In 1722 Sunderland was implicated in what became known as the Atterbury Plot, to restore the House of Stuart, and his death was one of the factors which brought the Plot to light.Devon and Exeter Oath Rolls, 1723 at foda.org.uk/oaths, accessed 12 June 2013 The town of Sunderland, Massachusetts, was named in his honour in November 1718, just after he became Lord President of the Council. Marriages and children His first wife was Lady Arabella Cavendish (19 August 16734 June 1698), daughter of Henry Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Newcastle. They had one daughter: *Lady Frances Spencer (27 July 1742), married Henry Howard, 4th Earl of Carlisle. His second wife was Lady Anne Churchill (27 February 168315 April 1716).

It is the topology generated by the basis of all half-open intervals [a,b), where a and b are real numbers. The resulting topological space is called the Sorgenfrey line after Robert Sorgenfrey or the arrow and is sometimes written \\\\mathbb{R}_l. Like the Cantor set and the long line, the Sorgenfrey line often serves as a useful counterexample to many otherwise plausible-sounding conjectures in general topology. The product of \\\\mathbb{R}_l with itself is also a useful counterexample, known as the Sorgenfrey plane. In complete analogy, one can also define the upper limit topology, or left half-open interval topology.  Properties  * The lower limit topology is finer (has more open sets) than the standard topology on the real numbers (which is generated by the open intervals). The reason is that every open interval can be written as a (countably infinite) union of half-open intervals. * For any real a and b, the interval [a,b) is clopen in \\\\mathbb{R}_l (i.e., both open and closed). Furthermore, for all real a, the sets \\\\\\\\{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} : x < a\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in\\\\mathbb{R} : x \\\\geq a\\\\\\\\} are also clopen. This shows that the Sorgenfrey line is totally disconnected. * Any compact subset of \\\\mathbb{R}_l must be an at most countable set. To see this, consider a non-empty compact subset C\\\\subseteq\\\\mathbb{R}_l. Fix an x \\\\in C, consider the following open cover of C: :: \\\\bigl\\\\\\\\{ [x, +\\\\infty) \\\\bigr\\\\\\\\} \\\\cup \\\\Bigl\\\\\\\\{ \\\\bigl(-\\\\infty, x - \\\\tfrac{1}{n} \\\\bigr) \\\\,\\\\Big\\\\, n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\Bigr\\\\\\\\}. :Since C is compact, this cover has a finite subcover, and hence there exists a real number a(x) such that the interval (a(x), x] contains no point of C apart from x. This is true for all x\\\\in C. Now choose a rational number q(x) \\\\in (a(x), x]\\\\cap\\\\mathbb{Q}. Since the intervals (a(x), x], parametrized by x \\\\in C, are pairwise disjoint, the function q: C \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Q} is injective, and so C is at most countable. * The name \\"lower limit topology\\" comes from the following fact: a sequence (or net) (x_\\\\alpha) in \\\\mathbb{R}_l converges to the limit L if and only if it \\"approaches L from the right\\", meaning for every \\\\epsilon>0 there exists an index \\\\alpha_0 such that \\\\forall\\\\alpha \\\\geq \\\\alpha_0 : L \\\\leq x_\\\\alpha < L+\\\\epsilon. The Sorgenfrey line can thus be used to study right- sided limits: if f: \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} is a function, then the ordinary right-sided limit of f at x (when the codomain carries the standard topology) is the same as the usual limit of f at x when the domain is equipped with the lower limit topology and the codomain carries the standard topology. * In terms of separation axioms, \\\\mathbb{R}_l is a perfectly normal Hausdorff space. * In terms of countability axioms, \\\\mathbb{R}_l is first-countable and separable, but not second-countable. * In terms of compactness properties, \\\\mathbb{R}_l is Lindelöf and paracompact, but not σ-compact nor locally compact. * \\\\mathbb{R}_l is not metrizable, since separable metric spaces are second-countable. However, the topology of a Sorgenfrey line is generated by a quasimetric. * \\\\mathbb{R}_l is a Baire space .

He served as Southern Secretary, Northern Secretary and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Between 1751 and 1789, he was known as the 3rd Viscount Weymouth. He is possibly best known for his role in the Falklands Crisis of 1770. Early life He was born on 13 September 1734, the eldest son and heir of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth (1710–1751) by his wife Louisa Carteret (c.1712-1736), a daughter of John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, 2nd Baron Carteret (1690–1763). On her father's side, she was a great-granddaughter of John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628-1701), and her father's first-cousin was William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath (1692-1711), on whose death the Earldom of Bath became extinct. Family origins The Thynnes are descended from Sir John Thynne (c.1515-1580), the builder of Longleat House, the family seat in Wiltshire, who acquired vast estates after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Sir John owed his wealth and position to the favour of his master, the Lord Protector Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset.'Parliamentary history : 1529–1629', in A History of the County of Wiltshire, vol. 5 (1957), pp. 111–132, accessed 7 July 2011 He was comptroller of the household of the future Queen Elizabeth I of England. Another famous ancestor was Thomas Thynne (1648–1682), called on account of his wealth \\"Tom of Ten Thousand\\" and celebrated by Dryden as Issachar in Absalom and Achitophel, who was murdered in London in February 1682. Career He succeeded his father as 3rd Viscount Weymouth in January 1751 and served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland for a short time during 1765, although he never visited that country. Having become prominent in British politics, he was appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department in January 1768 and acted with great promptitude during the unrest caused by John Wilkes and the Middlesex election of 1768. He was then attacked and libeled by Wilkes, who was consequently expelled from the House of Commons. Falklands Crisis Before the close of 1768, he was transferred from the Northern Department to become Secretary of State for the Southern Department, but he resigned in December 1770 in the midst of the \\"Falklands Crisis\\", a dispute with Spain over the possession of the Falkland Islands. American War of Independence In November 1775, Weymouth returned to his former office of Secretary of State for the Southern Department, undertaking in addition the duties attached to the northern department for a few months in 1779, but he resigned both positions in the autumn of that year. This period covered the American War of Independence. Later life He was High Steward of the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield from 1781 until his death in November 1796, having been created Marquess of Bath in 1789. The title of Earl of Bath that had been held by his Granville ancestor was then unavailable, as it had been recreated for a member of the Pulteney family. Marriage and issue In 1759, he married Lady Elizabeth Bentinck, daughter of William Bentinck, 2nd Duke of Portland and the art collector Margaret Bentinck, Duchess of Portland, with whom he had three sons and three daughters, including: * Thomas Thynne, 2nd Marquess of Bath (1765-1837), eldest son and heir. * George Thynne, 2nd Baron Carteret (1770-1838), who inherited the title Baron Carteret by special remainder from his paternal uncle Henry Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret (1735-1826) (born Henry Thynne), of Haynes Park in Bedfordshire and of Stowe House, Kilkhampton in Cornwall, the seat of his ancestor John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628-1701), which descended via the Carteret family. Character He was a man of considerable ability, especially as a speaker. According to modern standards, his habits were coarse, resembling those of his friend and frequent companion Charles James Fox. Horace Walpole refers frequently to his idleness and his drunkenness, and in early life at least \\"his great fortune he had damaged by such profuse play, that his house was often full of bailiffs.\\" References ;Attribution * Category:1734 births Category:1796 deaths Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:British Secretaries of State Category:Grooms of the Stool Category:Knights of the Garter Category:Lords Lieutenant of Ireland 1 Category:Members of The Club Category:Members of the Privy Council of Great Britain Thomas ","title":"Thomas Thynne, 1st Marquess of Bath"},{"id":"310521","text":"A stuntman or stunt performer is someone who performs dangerous stunts.

As commander of the Portolà expedition on land and sea that established San Diego and Monterey, Portolá expanded New Spain's Las Californias province far to the north from its beginnings on the Baja California peninsula. Portolá's expedition also was the first known European to see and record what we now call San Francisco Bay.

Don Gaspar served as a soldier in the Spanish army in Italy and Portugal. He was commissioned ensign in 1734, and lieutenant in 1743. Expulsion of the Jesuits Beginning in 1684, Jesuit missionaries started establishing missions on the Baja California Peninsula. Later, rumors circulated that the Jesuits had amassed a fortune and were becoming very powerful. As part of the nearly global suppression of the Jesuits, King Carlos III ordered the Jesuits expelled and deported to the Papal States on the Italian peninsula. Following the command of the king, the Viceroy of New Spain ordered the arrest and deportation of all Jesuits in missions. Portolá was sent and charged with the expulsion of the Jesuits. The missions were turned over to the Franciscans, and later to the Dominicans. Expedition to expand Las Californias to the north Spain was driven to establish missions and other outposts on the Pacific Coast north of the Baja California Peninsula by fears that the territory would be claimed by foreign powers. The English, who had established colonies on the East Coast of the continent and north into what is now Canada, had also sent explorers into the Pacific. Russian fur hunters were pressing east from Siberia across the Bering Strait into the Aleutian Islands and beyond. Dispatches of January 23, 1768, exchanged between King Carlos and the viceroy, set the wheels in motion to extend Spain's control up the Pacific Coast and establish colonies and missions at San Diego Bay and Monterey Bay, which had been discovered and described in reports by earlier explorers Juan Cabrillo and Sebastián Vizcaíno. Vizcaíno had mapped the California coastline as far north as Monterey in 1602, but no significant Spanish settlement or even trading station had followed because those earlier explorations had failed to find a good harbor that the Spanish could have used for their long-standing Pacific maritime trade between Asia and Mexico: the Monterey Bay, sighted by both Cabrillo and Vizcaino, was exposed to rough currents and winds. In May 1768, the Spanish Visitor General, José de Gálvez, began to organize an expedition, by sea and by land. Portolá was created \\"Governor of the Californias\\" and given overall command. Junípero Serra, leader of the expedition's Franciscan missionaries, took command of spiritual matters. Sea and land detachments were to meet at San Diego Bay. The first ship, the San Carlos, sailed from La Paz on January 10, 1769 and a second, the San Antonio sailed from Cabo San Lucas on February 15. At the same time, the various elements of the land parties began to move north from Loreto, Baja California Sur. The land expedition was assembled at Velicatá, where Serra established his first new mission. From there, Portolá's plan called for splitting the land expedition in two. The lead group, charged with building a wagon trail and pacifying the natives, was led by Captain Fernando Rivera y Moncada, and departed from Velicatá on March 24. With Rivera was the priest Juan Crespí, diarist for the Franciscans. The expedition led by Portolá, which included Junípero Serra (the President of the Missions), along with a combination of missionaries, settlers, and leather-jacket soldiers, including José Raimundo Carrillo, left Velicatá on May 15. Junípero Serra founded two more missions during the expedition: San Diego de Alcalá on July 16, 1769 and Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on June 3, 1770. Portolá 1769 - Commemorative plaque situated in Elysian Park, Los Angeles Rivera reached the site of present-day San Diego in May, established a camp in the area that is now Old Town and awaited the arrival of the others. Because of an error by Vizcaíno in determining the latitude of the San Diego Harbor, the ships passed by it and landed too far north before finding their way back. The San Antonio arrived on April 11 and the San Carlos, the first ship to leave La Paz, having met with fierce winds and storms on the journey, arrived on April 29. A third vessel was to follow with supplies, but it was probably lost at sea. The land expedition of Portolá arrived on June 29. After their arduous journeys, most of the men aboard ship were ill, chiefly from scurvy, and many had died. Out of a total of 219 who left Baja California, little more than 100 now survived. Eager to press on to Monterey Bay, Portolá and his expedition, consisting of Juan Crespí, 63 leather-jacket soldiers and 100 mules loaded down with provisions, headed north on July 14, 1769. Marching two to four leagues (1 league = 2.6 miles) a day, they reached the site of present-day Fullerton, at Hillcrest Park on July 30, 1769. They next traveled to Brea Canyon, in Brea, California, on July 31, 1769. They arrived in what is now Los Angeles on August 2. The following day, they marched out the Indian trail that would one day become Wilshire Boulevard to the present site of Santa Monica. Winding around to the area of later Saugus, now part of Santa Clarita, they reached the area to become Santa Barbara on August 19, and the present day San Simeon area on September 13. Unable to remain on the coast due to the steep, difficult terrain, the party turned inland. They marched through the San Antonio Valley and on October 1, Portolá's party emerged from the Santa Lucia Mountains and reached the mouth of the Salinas River. After a march of some from San Diego and about from Velicatá, they had reached the bay they were seeking. But they failed to discern the coastline's semi-circular shape, described by Vizcaíno as round like an \\"O\\", even though members of the party had twice marched along its beach. Having failed to find their goal, they marched on north and reached the area at the north end of the bay, where Crespi named a creek Santa Cruz on October 18. Pushing on, they reached a creek in the town of present day Pacifica on October 31. On November 4, having crossed the low coastal mountain range above the creek, the party was stunned to catch a glimpse of the enormous San Francisco Bay from the mountain range, as the bay was previously unknown to the Spanish. This sighting was crucial to the later settlement of California because unlike Monterey Bay, it was surrounded by land on all sides except the Golden Gate, and thus it was not exposed to rough ocean currents as was the Monterey Bay, which had been known to the Spanish since Cabrillo's exploration in the sixteenth century. Despite the earlier explorations of Cabrillo and Vizcaino, and despite two centuries of Spanish sailing the Pacific for trade between Asia and Mexico, the San Francisco Bay had been missed because of the fog that frequently shrouded its entrance. If the San Francisco Bay had been discovered earlier, the region surrounding would have been settled by the Spanish earlier since it would have provided a safe, convenient harbor for Spain's Pacific maritime trade. Portola's party then headed back to San Diego, exploring and naming many localities in the region south of what eventually became known as the Golden Gate. Surviving on mule meat for most of the journey, they arrived on January 24, 1770. CHL #2 Portolá Journey's End On their way past Monterey Bay they again failed to recognize it as the same bay that Vizcaino had described in 1602. Second expedition One of Portolá's officers, Captain Vicente Vila, convinced him that he had actually been exactly on the Bay of Monterey when he placed his second cross at what later became Pacific Grove. After replenishing supplies at San Diego, Portolá and Serra decided on a joint expedition by land and sea to again search for the bay and establish a colony if they were successful. The San Antonio sailed on April 16, 1770. On board were Serra, Miguel Costansó, military engineer and cartographer, and Doctor Pedro Prat, army surgeon, along with a cargo of supplies for the new mission at Monterey. On April 17, after mustering what forces he could, Portolá's land expedition, which included lieutenant Pedro Fages, 12 Spanish volunteers, seven leather- jacket soldiers, five Baja California Indians, two muleteers, and Juan Crespí serving as the expedition's chaplain, again marched north. The expedition followed the same route they had the previous winter while returning to San Diego. After 36 days on the road, with only two days of rest, Portolà arrived at his second cross on May 24, 1770. He then saw that on a clear day and from a certain point of view the round harbor assumed the proportions described by the earlier enthusiastic explorers. Having recognized the bay, a Mass was conducted near the oak tree that the Carmelite missionaries with Vizcaíno had worshiped under in 1603, and possession was officially taken. On June 3, 1770, they laid the beginnings of the Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo and founded the Presidio of Monterey. Later career Governor Portolá's task was finished. He then left Captain Pedro Fages in charge, and on June 9 he sailed for San Blas, never to return to Upper California. In 1776, Portolá was appointed the governor of Puebla. After the appointment of his successor in 1784, he was advanced money for expenses and returned to Spain, where he served as commander of the Numancia cavalry dragoon regiment. On February 7, 1786 he was appointed King's Lieutenant for the strongholds and castles of Lleida. He died that same year, in October. Legacy Statue of Gaspar de Portolá, by the sculptor Josep Maria Subirachs A 9 ft (2.7 m) statue in Pacifica, California was sculpted by the Catalan sculptor Josep Maria Subirachs and his associate, Francesc Carulla. It was given to the State of California by the Catalan regional government in 1988. The city of Portola in Plumas County, the town of Portola Valley in San Mateo County, and the Portola neighborhood of San Francisco were named after Portolá. A number of schools in California were also named after him, including Portola Hills Elementary School in Portola Hills, Portola Elementary School in San Bruno, Portola Junior High School in El Cerrito, Gaspar de Portola Middle School in Tierrasanta, Portola Middle School in Tarzana, and Portola Middle School in Orange. The school in Orange is close to the spot where the expedition crossed the Santa Ana River, and the school has a 60-foot mural depicting the Portola Expedition. Portola Parkway running through Irvine and Lake Forest (though not connected as of 2018), was also named after Portolà. It is said that Portolà used the same route Portola Parkway now runs across. Portola Drive, which runs parallel to and near the Monterey Bay shoreline, is the main street of the Pleasure Point area of Santa Cruz County. Portola Avenue is also a north-south street located in Palm Desert in the Coachella Valley.

the Minnesota North Stars, Dallas Stars, Detroit Red Wings and Philadelphia Flyers. He currently serves as the head coach of the Sarnia Sting of the Ontario Hockey League. He is the younger brother of former NHL player Kevin Hatcher, with whom he was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame on October 21, 2010. In 2015 Hatcher and David Legwand, a fellow OHL alumnus, NHL player, and Michigan native, purchased and became co-owners of the Sting. Playing career As a youth, Hatcher played in the 1985 and 1986 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments with the Detroit Compuware minor ice hockey team. Hatcher was known as a physical defenseman and a strong bodychecker and used his intimidating size to good effect. He was drafted in the 1st round as the 8th overall selection by the Minnesota North Stars in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft and scored in his NHL debut game on October 12, 1991. Hatcher played for the North Stars and went with them when they moved to Dallas in 1993. He played another 10 years for the Dallas Stars, collecting 71 goals, 223 assists, 1,380 penalty minutes, and captained the Stars to the Stanley Cup in 1999. In doing so, he became the first American-born captain to win the Stanley Cup. In July 2003, Hatcher signed with the Detroit Red Wings for a five-year, $30 million contract. A knee injury in just the third game of the season forced Hatcher to miss most of the year, playing in just 15 regular season games with the Red Wings. In 2004, due to the cancellation of the NHL season, Hatcher, along with fellow Detroit Red Wings teammates Chris Chelios and Kris Draper, decided to play minor league hockey with the Motor City Mechanics based out of Fraser, Michigan. On August 2, 2005, Hatcher signed with the Philadelphia Flyers after his contract with Detroit was bought out due to the new salary cap. On January 29, 2006, Hatcher was named interim captain of the Flyers. He served as captain for the rest of the 2005–06 season due to the absence of injured captain Keith Primeau. Hatcher has also served as an alternate captain for the Flyers. Suffering from a right knee injury, he missed the entire 2008–09 NHL season. Hatcher later returned as a \\"co-coach\\" for the playoffs. After having replacement surgery on the same knee on June 1, 2009, Hatcher said that he would most likely not return to playing hockey. On June 15, 2009, Hatcher formally announced his retirement from the National Hockey League, this was announced with the Dallas Stars. He will remain in the Flyers organization as a player development coach, taking a job vacated by another former Flyer defenseman and captain, Éric Desjardins, who resigned to pursue business interests.https://nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=1698059 Hatcher remains the longest-serving captain in the history of the Dallas Stars and their predecessors, the Minnesota North Stars.

Historically, the extension was used for documentation in plain text, particularly of programs or computer hardware on a wide range of operating systems. During the 1980s, WordPerfect used DOC as the extension of their proprietary format. Later, in 1983, Microsoft chose to use the DOC extension for their proprietary Microsoft Word format. These uses for the extension have largely disappeared from the PC world. Microsoft Word Binary File Format Binary DOC files often contain more text formatting information (as well as scripts and undo information) than some other document file formats like Rich Text Format and Hypertext Markup Language, but are usually less widely compatible. The DOC files created with Microsoft Word versions differ. Microsoft Word versions before Word 97 (\\"8.0\\") used a different format from the OLE/CFBF-based Microsoft Word 97 – 2003. In Microsoft Word 2007 and later, the binary file format was replaced as the default format by the Office Open XML format, though Microsoft Word can still produce DOC files. Application support The DOC format is native to Microsoft Word. Other word processors, such as OpenOffice.org Writer, IBM Lotus Symphony, Apple Pages and AbiWord, can also create and read DOC files, although with some limitations. Command line programs for Unix-like operating systems that can convert files from the DOC format to plain text or other standard formats include the wv library, which itself is used directly by AbiWord. Specification Because the DOC file format was a closed specification for many years, inconsistent handling of the format persists and may cause some loss of formatting information when handling the same file with multiple word processing programs. Some specifications for Microsoft Office 97 binary file formats were published in 1997 under a restrictive license, but these specifications were removed from online download in 1999. Specifications of later versions of Microsoft Office binary file formats were not publicly available. The DOC format specification was available from Microsoft on request since 2006 under restrictive RAND-Z terms until February 2008. Sun Microsystems and OpenOffice.org reverse engineered the file format. On February 15, 2008, Microsoft released a .DOC format specification under the Microsoft Open Specification Promise. However, this specification does not describe all of the features used by DOC format and reverse engineered work remains necessary. Since 2008 the specification has been updated several times; the latest change was made in November 2019. The format used in earlier, pre-97 (\\"1.0\\" 1989 through \\"7.0\\" 1995) versions of Word are less known, but both OpenOffice and LibreOffice contains open-source code for reading these formats. The format is probably related to the \\"Stream\\" format found in similar Excel versions. Word 95 also seems to have an OLE-wrapped form.  Other file formats  Some historical documentations may use the DOC filename extension for plain-text file format. The DOC filename extension was also used in historical versions of WordPerfect for its proprietary format. Some software applications use the name DOC in combination with other words (such as the name of software manufacturer) for different file formats. As an example, on the Palm OS, DOC is shorthand for PalmDoc, a completely unrelated format (commonly using PDB filename extension) used to encode text files such as ebooks.

Formerly a radio talk show host with KGO 810 AM in San Francisco, California, Ward, once billed by KGO as \\"The Lion of the Left\\" and \\"unabashedly liberal,\\" was the host of the daily news talk program, The Bernie Ward Show, and the three-hour program, GodTalk, on Sunday mornings. In December 2007, Ward was dismissed from KGO following his federal grand jury child pornography indictment. Subsequently, in a plea bargain with federal prosecutors, Ward admitted to a single felony charge of online distribution of child pornography and signed an admission of distributing between 15 and 150 images via email. He consequently served a six-year prison sentence, and was released in 2014. Biography Bernie Ward was born in San Francisco, California, where he attended Holy Name Grammar School, St. Ignatius High School, and the University of San Francisco. He then studied for three years at the Franciscan School of Theology in Berkeley, obtaining a Theology degree in 1977. He was ordained to the Catholic priesthood with the Missionaries of the Precious Blood the same year, but left the priesthood after two years. Ward later taught theology at Cardinal Newman High School in Santa Rosa, California and its sister school, Ursuline High School. At Ursuline in 1978, allegations of Ward's sexual misconduct first began to surface. Ward also taught at Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, California. In 1981, he relocated to Washington, D.C. where he taught marriage and sex education at the Georgetown Preparatory School, a private Jesuit Roman Catholic high school, while his wife attended medical school. Ward later worked for then-Representative Barbara Boxer from 1982 to 1985. Radio talk show host Ward's employment at KGO (AM) began in 1985 where he served as a fill-in talk show host, a general-assignment reporter, and later as a political talk show host starting in 1992. As a reporter, where Jerry Jay Carroll of the San Francisco Chronicle noted on October 25, 1995, that it had become a ritual for the mayor at that time, Art Agnos, to denounce him for lies at the beginning of every news conference. Ward also went on to host \\"God Talk,\\" a show on religion and related topics. Briefly in 1996, Ward's talk show was nationally syndicated until his ratings declined. His show's ratings began to improve in 1997 in Ward's core demographic group (women ages 25 to 54) as a result of his more lenient views on topics such as child-rearing and ethics. On October 5, 1997, a rumor that KGO was discontinuing Bernie Ward's contract effective at the end of the month was published by the San Francisco Chronicle. In protest, supporters of his show flooded the KGO studios with canned food donations, continuing a seven-year Thanksgiving fundraising drive started by Ward that had netted more than $1 million in donations shared by the St. Anthony Foundation and two other area charities. The protest culminated in a noontime rally staged in front of the KGO studios. KGO management reversed their decision and renewed Ward's contract. On December 31, 2007, Bernie Ward was fired from KGO because of his indictment on child pornography charges. Child pornography conviction On September 20, 2007, Ward was indicted by a grand jury on two federal counts of Attempting to Distribute and one count of Receiving child pornography via the Internet from December 2004 to January 2005. The police investigation of Ward originated with a complaint from a Stanislaus County homemaker who was posing online as a dominatrix under the screenname \\"Sexfairy2005\\" and who had engaged in online chats with Ward. According to the police report, Ward sent pornographic images of children to the chat partner, which caused her to contact police. The police began collecting evidence with her help and continued chat sessions with Ward. In the chat logs (found here ), Ward also described sexual activity with his own children.\\" Ward and his children both later told investigators that none of the activities described in the chats ever actually occurred, Ward contending it was just sexual fantasy talk. In a statement, Ward's attorney did not dispute engaging in the chats or transmitting the photos, but instead claimed Ward was role-playing with the dominatrix in part for research on a book about hypocrisy in America. Federal investigators could find no evidence that Ward was working on such a book. Ward's attorney claimed that federal authorities found no illegal images on his computer, which they seized in early 2005.\\" However, after police obtained a search warrant for Ward's online account, they found about 100 images of child pornography in his AOL email account on AOL's servers which had been opened and forwarded, with sexual activity involving children. On May 8, 2008, Ward announced an agreement to plead guilty to one count of Distribution of Child Pornography in exchange for the dropping of two additional counts of Possession and Distribution. In his plea agreement, Ward admits that he transmitted child pornography \\"between 15 and 150 times.\\" Under federal statute, Ward could have been sentenced to between five and 20 years in prison. The Department of Justice requested he be sentenced to nine years in prison. On August 28, 2008, Judge Vaughn Walker sentenced Ward to seven years and three months in federal prison. Judge Walker agreed to Ward's request that he be allowed to serve his time in the Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc, to which the U.S. Attorney raised no objection. Judge Walker commented that Ward's alleged sexual misconduct while serving as a priest may go to character, but that the events happened too long ago to be relevant to his sentencing decision. He also said that he was not convinced sending Ward to prison is the best way to deal with an individual with such problems and that \\"very little good has come out of all this.\\" Ward told Judge Walker that he took full responsibility for his actions and said, \\"I regret my actions, the harm they caused my family, my friends, and this community.\\" With good behavior, Ward's sentence of 87 months was reduced by 15 percent, making him eligible for Supervised Release on December 19, 2014; there is no parole in the Federal system. On release from prison California's Megan's Law designated Ward a registered sex offender. For the remainder of his life Ward must in- person notify and register with local law enforcement about his residing or staying in its jurisdiction and locale. Ward served his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc, a low-security federal prison in California. He was released on December 19, 2014.http://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/ Personal beliefs Religion On March 16, 1996, Ward discussed the confrontational tactics of the group ACT UP at a mosque, describing the group as a \\"collection of non-partisan individuals committed to direct action to end AIDS.\\" He stated that \\"homosexuals had a good cause to make (against the Catholic Church),\\" and claimed that the church encouraged homophobia and homophobic actions. The church denied this, stating that they did not encourage homophobia or resistance against homosexuals, but merely taught that homosexual sex, because it is outside a marriage between a man and a woman, was immoral. On December 9, 1996, Ward stated that Christianity was \\"morally superior\\" to Judaism because it was based on unconditional forgiveness. He offered apologies on his radio show on December 17 and again on the following day, the first being dismissed by the Jewish Community Relations Council and the second being accepted. Ward insisted that he did not have a problem with any individual religion, only with fundamentalists. He later compared fundamentalist Orthodox Judaism with Nazism on September 12, 2001 but offered an apology the following day. Iraq war On September 30, 2002, Ward appeared on CNN with Wolf Blitzer and discussed possible military action against Iraq. He commented about Saddam Hussein: \\"Hussein has not shown any threat to anyone\\" and that the \\"Kurds were prospering very well in the north even as al-Qaeda has used some of their connections with the Kurds.\\" Causes He led a pledge drive for Thanksgiving Charities every year, which supported four charities in the San Francisco Bay Area: Sacred Heart Community Services in San Jose, St. Anthony's Foundation in San Francisco, St. Vincent De Paul dining room in Oakland, and Fresh Start in Walnut Creek. The charity drive began in the late 1980s and raised over $4 million in the following decades. Ward was also a participant in the KGO leukemia cure-a- thon, which has raised over $13 million for research into leukemia and lymphoma causes. Recognition Ward received the Scripps Howard Award for Excellence in Journalism for his investigative journalism in a 10-part series, Heaven Help Us, which explored allegations of financial and sexual misconduct of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco. He has also won numerous national awards, such as an Associated Press award for coverage of the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

It lived on the island of Rodrigues and surrounding islands and typically dwelt on trees. The Rodrigues giant day gecko fed on insects and nectar, and, unlike most other day geckos, was apparently nocturnal in habit. Description Bones Phelsuma gigas was the largest known gecko. It reached a total length of about . The body colour was grayish or grayish brown. On the back there were irregular black spottings. The tail had some striping and was charcoal- or dark grey-coloured. The tongue had a pink colour and the ventral side of the body was light yellow. The original collected specimens that were used to describe this species have been lost. Today, only a few portions of some skeletons remain. Behaviour Leguat described the species: Distribution This species inhabited Rodrigues and surrounding islands. P. gigas was last collected in 1842 on the offshore islet of Ile aux Fregates. Habitat P. gigas was an arboreal lizard living on trees within the forests of Rodrigues. P. gigas became extinct due to human-induced deforestation and predation by introduced cats and rats. Diet These day geckos fed on various insects and other invertebrates. As observed in other species of day geckos, it was assumed that P. gigas also liked to lick at soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer John Byrne, the character first appeared in Iron Fist #14 (August 1977). Sabretooth was originally portrayed as a non-powered serial killer but was later written as a mutant possessing bestial superhuman abilities, most notably a rapid healing factor, razor-sharp fangs and claws, and superhuman senses. He is a vicious assassin, responsible for numerous deaths both as a paid mercenary and for his personal pleasure. Accounts as to the origin of his enmity with Wolverine are conflicted. It is known that Wolverine and Sabretooth were participants of the Cold War supersoldier program Weapon X, and that Sabretooth saw Wolverine as competition and therefore antagonized him. While Wolverine is depicted as suppressing his more savage qualities, Sabretooth does the opposite and embraces them, until the events of the 2014 storyline \\"AXIS\\". The character has appeared in several X-Men animated series and video games, and was portrayed by Tyler Mane in the first X-Men film and by Liev Schreiber in the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine. In May 2008, Wizard magazine ranked Sabretooth #193 of the 200 best comic book characters of all time. In 2009, Sabretooth was ranked as IGN's 44th Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.Sabretooth is number 44 . IGN. Publication history \\"Sabre-Tooth\\" first appeared in Iron Fist #14. The character first appeared in Iron Fist #14 (August 1977) and was created by Chris Claremont and John Byrne. Sabretooth was initially conceived as a recurring antagonist for Iron Fist, whom he fights several times. He works for a time with the Constrictor as a partner-in-crime, and clashes repeatedly with Iron Fist and Power Man.Power Man and Iron Fist #66Power Man and Iron Fist #84 Sabretooth also appeared in comics such as The Spectacular Spider-Man. Chris Claremont introduced him as a minor X-Men villain, a member of the Marauders, during the \\"Mutant Massacre\\" crossover in 1986. He rose to greater prominence when he was split off from the Marauders and became a recurring antagonist of an individual member of the X-Men, Wolverine. Sabretooth was subsequently featured in limited series and one-shot comics including Sabretooth and Mystique and Sabretooth: In the Red Zone, and even had his own ongoing reprint series in the mid-1990s, Sabretooth Classics. Origin Chris Claremont had meant for Sabretooth to be Wolverine's father, though this was contradicted by subsequent writers. Claremont, when asked what he had intended to be the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, stated: > Father and son. That's why Sabretooth always considered Logan \\"sloppy > seconds\\" to his \\"original\\" / \\"real deal.\\" The other critical element in my > presentation of their relationship was that, in their whole life, Logan has > never defeated Sabretooth in a knock-down, drag-out, kill-or-be-killed > berserker fight. By the same token, on every one of his birthdays, > Sabretooth has always managed to find him, no matter where Logan was or what > he was doing, and come within an inch of killing him. For no other reason > than to remind him that he could. Genetic tests performed by S.H.I.E.L.D. confirmed that Sabretooth and Wolverine were not father and son.Wolverine Vol. 2 #42 An interviewer asked Paul Jenkins if Dog Logan was Sabretooth. Jenkins had not intended the speculation, but said would not have a problem with another writer doing this later. The miniseries Astonishing Spider-Man & Wolverine has shown that the two characters are not the same person.Astonishing Spider-Man and Wolverine #6 A one-shot specialty comic entitled X-Men Origins: Sabretooth chronicling some of the character's earliest childhood experiences, differing distinctly from Dog's life. It's also later shown that Sabretooth and Dog are separate people.Wolverine Vol. 2 #304 X-Men Forever In X-Men Forever, Chris Claremont's continuation of his run on X-Men (non-canonical to the mainstream timeline and taking place in the 161 Marvel Universe), Sabretooth is established as Wolverine's father. He attacks the X-Mansion, but is blinded by Storm. Claremont has stated in an interview that in X-Men Forever the original true Sabretooth makes his reappearance after a long time, and that most of the previous appearances of Sabretooth prior to X-Men Forever #2, that follows directly after X-Men vol. 2 #3, were that of a weaker Sabretooth clone created by Mister Sinister. The original true Sabretooth reappears dressed in the Jim Lee costume in X-Men Forever, which would make the weaker clone the one dressed in the John Byrne costume. Claremont claims he always meant for the Sabretooth dressed in the Byrne costume to be later outed as a clone of the original true Sabretooth. Claremont stated: \\"Speaking specifically of the cast of X-Men Forever, one character who's becoming more enticing is Sabretooth, in part because (at least as it relates to my conception of him) very little is actually known. They then filled his skeleton with adamantium. At this specific point of his life, readers haven't really seen that much of him over the years, since the Sabes that's shown up most over the time is a less- endowed copy cloned from spare cells by Mr. Sinister.\\" Fictional character biography Early life Sabretooth's real name is believed to be Victor Creed.X-Men vol. 2 #5 (February 1992) Sabretooth's memories have been tampered with by clandestine organizations such as Weapon X and so much of what appears to be his past is not of credible account.Conflicting accounts in Origin II, Origins: Sabretooth, X-Men, Uncanny X-Men in the 90s, and the 90s Sabretooth limited series The clearest accounts of Victor's childhood begin with him murdering his brother Luther Creed over a piece of pie.X-Men Origins - Sabretooth His father then chains him in the basement like an animal and systematically pulls out Victor's elongated canines, which perennially grow back. Victor begs his mother to let him go, but she does not. Years pass until Victor eventually gnaws off his own hand in order to escape the basement and apparently murders his parents. It is, however, later revealed that Sabretooth only killed his father, and took care of his mother financially, visiting his mother frequently until the woman's death.Wolverine Vol. 4 #11 Victor is revealed to have had a brother, Saul, and sister, Clara, who are believed to be the reason for Victor's ongoing feud with the X-Men's Wolverine. Saul Creed was a tracker and hunter, while Clara Creed was an animal handler. They helped track down the feral James \\"Logan\\" Howlett for a circus.Origin II #2 They also helped Logan escape after the man was experimented on by Nathaniel Essex, and the three go on the run.Origin II #3 Saul perceives Logan to be stealing Clara, leading to Saul tipping Essex off regarding Logan's location. In the ensuing chaos, Logan accidentally kills Clara, although her healing factor later revives Clara. Saul, not knowing this, blames Essex for Clara's death, and the two men seek Essex out, Saul revealing that Clara was his sister.Origin II #4 Logan, however, finds out that Saul betrayed them to Essex, and drowns Saul in a potion of Essex's. Horrified by this, Clara asks Wolverine to never look for her again. Victor was then informed about his brother's death.Origin II #5 In an early tale, Logan lives in a small Blackfoot community. One day, Sabretooth tracks him down in Canada, and seemingly murders his one-time teammate's lover Silver Fox on Logan's birthday, after Silver Fox rejects him. In this tale, it is indicated that Logan did not have particularly strong feelings for Silver Fox, and that the murder was simply the last straw in a series of grievances he held against Sabretooth.Wolverine vol. 2 #10 Creed eventually adopts a tradition of tracking Logan down on his foe's birthday with the intention of fighting. Early history Creed is recruited into a top secret CIA covert ops unit known as Team X, with allies John Wraith (Kestrel), Logan (Wolverine), Silver Fox (whose death was a hoax), and David North (Maverick). On one mission, the psychopathic Sabretooth kills a crucial scientist during a battle against Russian supersoldier Omega Red, causing Team X to break up.X-Men (vol. 2) #4-7 During this period he fathers a son, Graydon Creed, with the mutant shapeshifter Mystique, who is undercover in the guise of a spy named Leni Zauber. Graydon grows up to found Friends of Humanity, an anti-mutant organization, and while running for President is assassinated by Mystique from an alternate future.X-Men Forever #2 After the disbanding of Team X, Logan and Victor meet up again, as friends, when Logan learns of anti-mutant forces within the government. Victor and Logan form a team of rebel mutants, and Victor falls in love with a mutant named Holo. Eventually, Creed grows tired of the fighting and wants to leave with Holo, but she has already decided against it. In the final conflict, Holo is mortally wounded. Creed blames Logan for her death.First X-Men #1-5 Next, Sabretooth is recruited by the Weapon X program, but it is unknown what, if any, enhancements he receives. As part of the program, his memories are tampered with by the psychic mutant Aldo Ferro, also known as Psi-Borg.Sabretooth #2 (September 1993) In 1968, Creed (using the alias Sabretooth) works as a mercenary assassin in Saigon. An individual called the \\"White Devil\\", involved in the disappearance of soldiers and locals, contacts Sabretooth and offers to employ him as one of his own enforcers. Sabretooth accepts.Weapon X vol. 2 #27 Supervillain Emerging as a costumed villain, Sabretooth becomes partners with the Constrictor and the two act as enforcers for major criminal interests. Sabretooth battles Iron Fist and is badly beaten.Iron Fist #14 Sabretooth and the Constrictor then fight Iron Fist, Luke Cage, Misty Knight, and Colleen Wing only to be defeated again. With the Constrictor, Creed begins to stalk and kill human beings for pleasure, which earns him the newspaper title of \\"The Slasher\\"; he also attacks Misty Knight again.Power Man and Iron Fist #78 With the Constrictor, he attacks Harmony Young, but they are defeated by Luke Cage. The Constrictor and Sabretooth dissolve their partnership, and Sabretooth nearly kills the Constrictor at one time. Sabretooth battling Spider-Man on the cover of The Spectacular Spider-Man #116. Art by Rich Buckler. Sabretooth is next reunited with his employer, the Foreigner, who claims to have trained the mercenary at some point. He attacks the Black Cat, nearly biting through her leg until he encounters a crowbar hidden underneath her boot. He is defeated by Spider-Man, and outmaneuvered and humiliated by the Black Cat in combat.Spectacular Spider-Man #116, #119 Sabretooth eventually encounters a thief by the name of Gambit, and the two fight, but find they aren't exactly enemies.X-Men vol. 2 #33 Later, while recruiting for mastermind villain Mister Sinister, Gambit gathers a group of mutant criminals he has associated with who form the Marauders.Uncanny X-Men #350 Sinister clones several of the Marauders so that he has a loyal group of lackeys after the originals die.X-Men #37 The Marauders are directed to massacre the Morlocks, which sets Sabretooth in another battle against Wolverine.X-Factor #10; Thor #374; Uncanny X-Men #212-213 Sabretooth and the Marauders join in an attack on Polaris, and battle Wolverine again during the Marauders' attempt to kill Madelyne Pryor. Wolverine stabs Sabretooth through the heart and uses Scrambler's power to disable his healing factor, killing him.Uncanny X-Men #219, #221-222 He is replaced by a clone by the time the X-Men attack the Marauders' headquarters. With the X-Men slaughtering his teammates, Sabretooth fleesUncanny X-Men #240-241 and is reunited with Mr. Sinister at the X-Mansion.Uncanny X-Men #243 The X-Men and X-Factor attack them there, and kill both Sabretooth and Sinister.X-Factor #39 However, Sabretooth manages to keep his tradition of stalking Wolverine on his birthday that year. Sabretooth returns to the sewers to slaughter leftover Morlocks. He kills Chickenwings, hunts Mole, and then battles Archangel.X-Factor #51-53 Caliban, a surviving Morlock, hunts Sabretooth down. Sabretooth proves no match for Caliban, who breaks his back and leaves him for dead.New Mutants #90-91 It takes weeks for his healing factor to repair his spine, during which he sustains himself on sewer water and passing vermin. He recovers just in time to confront Wolverine, who stumbled upon him while lost in the sewers.Wolverine #41-42 He attacks Wolverine again in Times Square, but their conflict is cut short by a vigilante who shoots them both with hallucinogen- laced bullets which trigger memories of their time as partners in the CIA.Wolverine #45-46 Sabretooth then allies with Fenris and Matsu'o Tsurayaba against the X-Men and Maverick.X-Men vol. 2 #5-7 While attending a wrestling match, Sabretooth is attacked by the Weapon X robot Shiva. He is rescued by John Wraith, who convinces him to team up with the rest of Team X - Wolverine, Maverick, Silver Fox, and John Wraith - to discover why their anti-aging factors are suddenly failing. Their quest leads them to the telepath Aldo Ferro, the Psi-Borg. Ferro overwhelms them all with psychic illusions, concluding with a toothed tree which apparently consumes Creed.Wolverine #60-64 Suffering from severe bloodlust, Sabretooth hires telepathic mutant Birdy to help him keep his urges in check by providing what he calls \\"the glow\\", a psychic blast that satiates his bloodlust and numbs the pain of his suppressed memories as a youth, allowing himself control for short periods.Sabretooth limited series 1994 Betrayal of the X-Men and brief alliance with X-Factor A short time later, Birdy is killed by Sabretooth's grown son Graydon, who now has a hatred for mutants, especially his father. Without \\"the glow\\", Sabretooth slips into a murderous killing spree. This culminates in a clash with Maverick, whom Sabretooth defeats. He escapes, claiming only Wolverine can do what needs to be done to the psychotic Creed. Afterward, Maverick approaches the X-Men in Japan, and an ancient telepath, comatose since the nuclear bomb that destroyed Hiroshima, who mind-links with Creed and the team discovers Creed's psychosis was rooted in his time as a CIA operative. On a mission, he slaughtered a target, his wife (a \\"frail\\" for Creed), and a little boy. The look in the boy's eyes has followed Creed ever since. Ultimately, Sabretooth attacks Charles Xavier, leader of the X-Men. As Xavier infiltrates Creed's mind, he discovers that every victim Sabretooth has killed is remembered by the villain. Xavier is confident this means Creed values human life, and there is hope for the mutant. Sabretooth is incarcerated, as a wanted murderer, in a holographic environment because Xavier does not want him to roam on the grounds. Sabretooth is angered, but grudgingly stays with the team. During his incarceration, he assists in battles against the X-Cutioner and the Phalanx. Caliban, free of Apocalypse's control, kidnaps the X-Man Jubilee in exchange for Sabretooth. When Sabretooth arrives, he mauls Caliban's face, and Caliban flees. Wolverine, who had left the team after his adamantium was removed by Magneto, returns, and the villain escapes for a fight. This leads to Wolverine stabbing one of his claws into Sabretooth's brain.Wolverine vol. 2 #90 The newer, gentler Sabretooth is frequently nursed by X-Force member Boomer; he eventually reveals that he was feigning helplessness, and attacks Boomer. Psylocke saves the young mutant's life, and she uses her psionic knife to disable him. However, this no longer works because his brain injury from Wolverine freed him from the need for \\"the glow\\", furthermore rendering him resistant to telepathic detection and control. Retaliating, Sabretooth nearly kills Psylocke, but he is finally confronted by the X-Men, who incapacitate him.Sabretooth: In The Red Zone He is turned over to the custody of Dr. Valerie Cooper, who fits him with an explosive restraining collar and forces him to participate as a member of the government-sponsored X-Factor team. Creed later admits he was a \\"sleeper\\" agent with the mission of executing X-Factor members the government could not control. He eventually escapes, and returns once more to mercenary work. Under unknown circumstances he gains adamantium skeleton and claws.Wolverine (vol. 2) #126 Sabretooth is captured, along with Wolverine, by Apocalypse, who forces the two to fight each other for the right to become Apocalypse's new Horseman, Death. After Sabretooth's defeat, Apocalypse extracts the adamantium from him and bonds it to Wolverine, Wolverine having fought to win as he felt that he might resist the brainwashing and so be easier to defeat than Sabretooth, who might actually enjoy what he had become.Wolverine vol. 2 #145 Sabretooth then joins Mystique's new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, calling itself the Brotherhood, where he participates in an assassination attempt against Senator Robert Kelly. Weapon X and the Brotherhood Later, he is forced to become a member of a relaunched Weapon X program, where his skeleton is infused with adamantium once more. In Wolverine vol. 2 #166, Sabretooth reveals that by means of genetic enhancement the Weapon X program has increased his strength and accelerated his healing factor. Eventually he escaped the program again and resumed working solo. However, he sometimes worked on a team, such as when he worked with several other villains to locate the Identity Disc, a record of heroes' secret identities. This ended up being a ruse, though Nick Fury had the real disc.Identity Disc limited series, 2004 Later, in Canada, he encountered Sasquatch and the newest Wendigo. Sasquatch believes Creed may be responsible for some of the human deaths occurring there. Creed is seen setting traps and acting mysteriously. Sasquatch discovers Sabretooth is playing a twisted mind-game with the Wendigo before attempting to kill it. Sabretooth and the Wendigo fall into the Arctic Sea with Sabretooth biting the Wendigo's neck, and both are presumed dead by Sasquatch. After a fearsome battle in the arctic waters, Sabretooth emerged victorious with the hide of the Wendigo. Sabretooth would later attack the Xavier Institute, in a revamped Brotherhood consisting of leader Black Tom Cassidy, Mammomax, Avalanche, Exodus, and undercover heroes Nocturne and Juggernaut. Wolverine claims to have killed Sabretooth, spreading him \\"all over the grass\\", although Black Tom's plant abilities probably contributed to Sabretooth's survival; he returns in X-Men: The 198 Files. Reluctant alliance with the X-Men Promotional art for X-Men vol. 2 #189 (September 2006). Art by Chris Bachalo and Tim Townsend. In X-Men vol. 2 #188 (August 2006), Sabretooth was spotted fleeing a mysterious group of superhumans collectively known as The Children. Their reasons for pursuing him remained unknown, but two of them—Sangre and Serafina—were tracking him. Sangre activated a singularity generator that annihilated most of the town and killed all its citizens, except for a little girl whom Serafina deliberately shielded from the destruction so there would be a witness to what had happened. He later encountered two more of the Children—Aguja and Fuego. They attacked him and temporarily neutralized his healing factor, but he managed to escape regardless, only to end up at the Xavier Institute later that night seeking sanctuary. It is revealed that the Children are after Creed because he has seen them and knows who they are, while the public believed the X-Men destroyed the town. It is only when Rogue, the leader of the team, injected Nano-Sentinels into Sabretooth's blood that they take him along with their fight against the Children, a factor that one of the Children exploited. At one point, Cannonball saved his life during the battle. Sabretooth rewards him with some inside information: \\"The first time you turn your back, you're dead.\\" Following the incident on Providence, Creed escaped the X-Men, but was hurled into the middle of the Pacific Ocean by Cable. Writer Mike Carey noted he has no plans on redeeming Sabretooth, saying, \\"I'm not going to try and show a heroic side to Sabretooth's nature; I’m not going to retcon him so that there are reasons for his actions that make him forgivable. The things he's done are not forgivable and he can't be redeemed. I'm not making him into a hero; I'm making him into a team member and there are reasons within the first storyline as to why he ends up fighting alongside the X-Men against another enemy. And there are reasons why it's not so easy to simply shake him off again afterwards. There are things that are going on that will sort of unfold during the first year of my run which explain his being there and explain his being accepted with very, very grave misgivings into the team.\\" Death Sabretooth renews his rivalry with Wolverine following the latter's return to the X-Mansion. A fight soon breaks out with Wolverine tossing Sabretooth through a window. During the fight, Wolverine thinks back to the time when Sabretooth had, supposedly, killed Silver Fox. He remembers Sabretooth saying, \\"quod sum eris\\" and asks what it means. Sabretooth explains that it means \\"I am what you will be.\\" Wolverine loses control and calls Sabretooth insane before placing his fist against Sabretooth's throat. Creed tells him if he extracts his claws, he will rip his heart out. Wolverine replies, \\"Let 'er rip\\", and pops his claws into Sabretooth's throat.Wolverine vol. 3 #50 Wolverine later regains consciousness and finds himself chained to the roof of the Blackbird. He quickly breaks free of the chains and is surprised to find Sabretooth piloting the jet. Wolverine breaks into the cockpit and begins choking Sabretooth with one of the chains and causes him to crash. The two emerge from the flaming wreckage and, while healing from the injuries sustained in the crash, begin fighting once again until separated by a lightning bolt, courtesy of Wolverine's former teammate and current Queen of Wakanda, Storm.Wolverine vol. 3 #51 A short time later Sabretooth is chained up in the royal palace of Wakanda and complains to Wolverine, Storm, and the Black Panther. Sabretooth snaps the chains and escapes into the jungle, with the Black Panther quickly giving chase. The Black Panther catches up to him and the two begin to fight, with Sabretooth quickly gaining the upper hand. He holds the Black Panther off the ground by the neck, preparing to strike a killing blow, when Wolverine suddenly appears and slices off Sabretooth's left hand.Wolverine vol. 3 #53 Once the fight between the Black Panther and Sabretooth is broken up by Wolverine, Sabretooth is brought back to the Wakandan Palace and placed in a vibranium holding cell and guarded around the clock. The battle scene between the Black Panther and Sabretooth then becomes the focus of why Wolverine was brought to the palace in the first place. It seems that amongst the bones from an elephant graveyard, there are also some unidentified skeletal remains of another offshoot of Homo sapiens called \\"Lupus sapiens\\". The Black Panther and Wolverine are discussing that instead of there being one evolutionary path between humans and monkeys, that there may also have been one that developed from lupines. It is believed at this point that Romulus is the first of this race, and it is revealed that he has been the one behind Daken's attacks, and the driving force behind the Weapon X program. After the discussion with the Black Panther, Wolverine is awakened by the stench of blood from something that has a scent similar to his and Sabretooth's and also something else. It turns out to be an enhanced Wild Child who has now surpassed the abilities of both Wolverine and Sabretooth, thanks to Romulus. Wild Child strikes Wolverine with poison-tipped claws and incapacitates him for two days. When Wolverine awakens, he finds Sasquatch, Wolfsbane, and Feral and her sister Thornn ready to go back with him to the Weapon X complex so that they might get to the bottom of this lupine mystery. Once they all arrive at the Weapon X facility, Wolverine is plagued by memories that seem to mix past and present together and all of them controlled by Romulus.

Sabretooth finally shows up and immediately attacks him. In the ensuing battle Wolverine cuts off Sabretooth's left arm with the Muramasa. Sabretooth, still in his animalistic state tries to re-attach his arm allowing his healing factor to kick in, but it does not work. Wolverine explains to a bewildered Creed that it is because the sword interrupts the healing factor and that he has to finally kill Sabretooth for what he's done. Managing to regain control and speak between grunts, Sabretooth tells him, \\"Do it\\". Wolverine then decapitates Sabretooth, finally putting an end to his long-time enemy.

At the end of the storyline, it is shown that his inversion from evil to good is permanent due to him having been protected by an energy shield generated by the inverted Iron Man- along with Havok- leaving him reflecting on what he has become.

He admits not being able to keep living the lie his inverted-self has been, but he does not intend to become the monster he was, so he must become something different.

Powers and abilities Sabretooth using his tracking skills to find Wolverine. Sabretooth is a mutant with a number of both natural and artificial improvements to his physiology compared to normal humans. His primary mutant power is an accelerated healing ability that allows him to regenerate damaged or destroyed areas of his body and cellular structure far beyond the capabilities of an ordinary human. Like Wolverine's, his abilities have been depicted with variable degrees of contradiction by various creators. Sabretooth's increased attributes stem, in part from said healing. This \\"healing factor\\" also grants him virtual immunity against most poisons, drugs, toxins, and diseases, and limited immunity to the fatigue.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe vol. 4 #6 The regenerative qualities of his powers cause him to age at an unusually slow rate. While he is of an unknown advanced age, Sabretooth has the appearance and vitality of a tall, very burly, highly muscular man in his late 20s to mid 30s. The depiction of Sabretooth's powers has changed and evolved depending on creative team, with his healing power introduced as a retcon after he became Wolverine's rival. In other, earlier appearances, Sabretooth was much more average. In a fight with Spider-man, he was incapacitated when his face was severely wounded, and did not display any accelerated healing.The Spectacular Spider-Man vol. 1 #116 When Sabretooth returned, and his still prominent wounds were reopened when he was hit in the face.The Spectacular Spider-Man vol. 1 #119 Sabretooth possesses acute senses that are comparable to certain animals. This includes the ability to see objects with greater clarity and at much greater distances than an ordinary human. Is able to see with this same level of clarity in almost complete darkness, just like a nocturnal hunter. It's even said he can see infrared and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe vol. 3 #5 He possesses some degree of notable physical abilities, such as superhuman strength due to his healing factor. The exact limits of his strength are unknown, though he originally could crush an iron barbell with ease.Uncanny X-Men vol. 1 #213 His physical strength has been artificially enhanced at least twice, first was a strength enhancement from his son, Graydon.Sabretooth: Death Hunt #1 Then it was further enhanced after joining the latest incarnation of the Weapon X Program.Weapon X vol. 2 #4 His healing factor also grants him superhuman stamina, so he can push himself at peak capacity for several days before fatigue sets in. On top of this he is depicted as having retractable claws that can rend normal clothing and flesh with ease. His agility and reflexes were both naturally above human and further artificially enhanced. With an ability to pounce like a hunting Big Cat, stalk and move quietly throughout his appearances, most human and some super powered enemies can not react to his leap before being hit. Skills Sabretooth is an excellent hand-to-hand and armed combatant, having been trained by various organizations such as the CIA, Department H's Weapon X program, the Foreigner, and HYDRA. He is also an expert at hunting and tracking, even without the use of his heightened senses. Sabretooth also developed a high resistance to telepathic probing and manipulation, after an incident where his brain was skewered.Wolverine Vol.2 #90 And even with that damage to his brain, it's been shown that Sabretooth is actually quite intelligent compared to the average person, as shown by his ability to avoid capture and escape the highest levels of incarceration without assistance. He is also highly skilled at psychological manipulation, and has demonstrated the ability to speak fluent German.Black Widow #2 (2019) Other versions Age of Apocalypse and the Exiles In an alternate universe in Marvel Comics depicted in the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" storyline there is a vastly different version of Sabretooth. This version of the character has the same origin as the one in the normal continuity, but has a different moral alignment. He is actually one of the X-Men and a role model for other mutants in this alternate reality. This Sabretooth was initially a villain, having been recruited by Apocalypse, but he was cast out as a traitor when he expressed moral reservations about using nuclear weapons to wipe out the world's human population. Apocalypse intended to kill Sabretooth alongside the X-Men, but was thwarted by Magneto.X-Men Chronicles #1 (1995) Sabretooth came back into Apocalypse's fold and took part in a number of culls, but he eventually grew disgusted by his life and rebelled against Holocaust, for which he was imprisoned alongside the feral Wild Child. Instead of becoming a feral killer, like Holocaust intended, Sabretooth defeated Wild Child and became his master and protector. Together, the two escaped and joined the X-Men afterward.X-Men: Age of Apocalypse One Shot #1 He became a hero and an ally of Logan (Weapon X), and even adopted a young girl, Blink, as his daughter. In the Exiles comics, he spent decades in an alternate dimension raising mutant children, attempting to teach them ethics and tolerance, without incident.Astonishing X-Men #3 Also, this version of Sabretooth's biological son was theorized to be Nightcrawler, evidenced by the statement of Mystique that she had gone to the trouble of \\"finding a father with fur\\" when Nightcrawler complains he is cold and, when the Shadow King possesses Mystique, the captions reveal \\"one memory is more interesting then the others\\" and flashes to Sabretooth taunting Nightcrawler.X-Calibre #3 When the \\"Age of Apocalypse\\" timeline was apparently destroyed, Sabretooth became the leader of the extra-dimensional band of characters who slide into alternate realities, known as Weapon X. For a time he was also the leader of their counterpart team, the Exiles, and remains with the team to this day. This version of Sabretooth originally had no adamantium in his skeleton (though it was later revealed that his skeleton had become laced with adamantium like Wolverine), but was still superhumanly strong and possessed a regenerative healing factor.\\"Exiles #05 When Sabretooth decided to leave Weapon X, he stayed behind in a dimension to ensure that that reality's version of David Richards, the son of Franklin Richards and Rachel Summers, would not be corrupted by his virtually omnipotent powers. However, the boy turned evil anyway, despite Sabretooth's best efforts at raising him right.Exiles vol. 2 #59 When he was recruited by the Timebroker into the Exiles, Blink's personality became incredibly docile and subservient to Creed. Sabretooth gladly took the leadership role from Blink, a fact that Mimic clashed with him over multiple times. He continued to assist the Exiles in the race to catch Proteus. He survived being teleported into outer space by Blink (albeit by accident). After Proteus' defeat, Sabretooth stayed with the team to help fix the multiverse.Exiles vol. 2 #82 Later, when the Exiles needed to defeat the Silver Surfer, this version temporarily becomes a Herald of Galactus. He uses the powers he gained to maul the Silver Surfer, then after he no longer needed it he returned the Power Cosmic to Galactus.Exiles vol. 2 #88 At Sabretooth's request, Heather unhinges Psylocke from Earth-616 to join the Exiles in Power Princess' place as she might be their only chance if Proteus ever resurfaces. However, upon arrival, she clashes with Sabretooth, thinking him to be the Earth-616 Sabretooth that nearly killed her twice. They fight for a while, but eventually Psylocke catches on to the fact that Sabretooth is not there for a fight and Morph intervenes and makes an introduction. Surprisingly, Psylocke cannot be detected by any of Panoptichron's cameras.Exiles vol. 2 #91 Heather teleports Morph, Sabretooth, and Psylocke down to Earth-1720 to save the other Exiles, who are beaten or brainwashed, courtesy of this world's Madame Hydra, Sue Storm. He and the other Exiles save their brainwashed friends after fighting them.Exiles vol. 2 #92-94 Sabretooth then returns to an empty Panoptichron. He and Psylocke have been getting closer since their fight. It was later revealed on their first mission of the Exiles with Sabretooth as the new team leader, that his skeleton was now laced with adamantium, though exactly how this happened has yet to be revealed, as he never been previously shown to have had any such enhancements. Sabretooth was lost along with Mystique, Valeria, Sage, Rogue, and Gambit (most of the New Exiles team) when they were immersed within the Crystal Palace.Exiles vol. 2 #6 Apparently Blink and the new team of Exiles had found a way to reverse the process as Sabretooth has since been returned to the Age of Apocalypse, since he and Wild Child are seen following and confronting the X-Force from Earth-616.Uncanny X-Force #11 After teaming with X-Force to save Archangel, most of the AoA X-Men are killed. Nightcrawler stays on Earth-616 to join X-Force while Sabretooth returns to AoA with the only other survivor, Jean Grey. There, they face off against Weapon Omega, formerly this world's Logan and Jean Grey's husband. In an attempt to recreate the Decimation with clones of the Scarlet Witch,Uncanny X-Force #19.1 both Jean and Sabretooth end up powerless. They go on the run with the X-Terminated,Age of Apocalypse #1 and Sabretooth was injured a while later fighting Weapon Omega while saving Jean.Age of Apocalypse #10 In the months that followed, his son Graydon, also known as Horror Show, patched him up physically and the two made their peace. During the X-Termination crossover, AoA Nightcrawler's trip home resulted in the release of three evil beings that destroy anyone they touch. Several casualties resulted, including the AoA's Sabretooth, Horror Show, and Fiend, as well as the X-Treme X-Men's Xavier and Hercules.Astonishing X-Men #60 (2013) Earth X In another alternate reality, Earth X, Sabretooth was a member of a Hominid race of half-men, half- beast creatures known as the Bear Clan (along with the Wendigo spirit), who were staunch opponents of the Moon Clan, of which Wolverine was a member (along with Wild Child, Sasquatch, and Beast). House of M In the House of M alternate reality created by Scarlet Witch, Sabretooth is a messenger/assassin sent by Magneto. He was dispatched to assassinate Graydon Creed.Civil War: House of M #3 Magneto sent Sabretooth to deliver a threat to Black Panther. After a short fight, Black Panther decapitates Sabretooth with a vibranium sword, then returns the head to Magneto. It is unknown as to whether or not the head was reunited with the body at a later stage, but this seems unlikely due to later events.Black Panther vol. 4 #7 Marvel Noir In the Wolverine Noir series, this version of Sabretooth is only known by his name, Victor Creed, who owns a hotel named \\"The Puritan\\" as well as a boxing club called \\"Victory Boxing\\" in the southeast of the Bowery, which was used to get kids off the street. Logan's partner, Dog, mentioned Creed in the Puritan after he disappeared. Logan, expected by Victor, goes to the boxing club and the two fight; Victor beats him and has his body thrown into the alley, where Yuriko's body was also lying.Wolverine Noir #2 Victor and his thugs capture Logan after he passes out outside of a bar,Wolverine Noir #3 taking him to the train yards where Rose and Mariko are waiting with Dog tied to the train tracks. Rose reveals that she had Victor bring Logan and Dog here so that she could get revenge on them. Dog is run over by a train during this conversation and Rose shoots Mariko in the head so she could not betray them to help Logan, which makes Logan kill her and her thugs. Victor runs off during the fight, wishing Rose \\"good luck in hell\\".Wolverine Noir #4 Marvel Zombies Sabretooth, as a zombie, is one of a group of zombie villains who team together to try to devour the visiting Galactus. They manage to hurt the cosmic being, but are thrown off their goal by zombie \\"heroes\\", Wolverine being one of them. In the course of the battle, Wolverine decapitates Sabretooth.Marvel Zombies Vol. 1 #5 Mutant X In this reality, a feral Sabretooth roams the Canadian Wilderness with feral versions of Wolverine and Wild Child who help make up \\"The Pack\\". Near the end of the series he breaks off from \\"the Pack\\" rejoining up with Weapon X to bring back Wolverine. After kidnapping Wolverine's family Wolverine confronts him and kills him by chopping his head off.Mutant X #29 Ultimate Marvel The Ultimate Marvel depiction of Sabretooth The Ultimate Marvel Universe depiction of Sabretooth is a mutant soldier and commando for Weapon X, under the direction of a man by the name of Colonel Wraith who referred to him as \\"a poor man's Wolverine\\". He appears to be the only mutant who enlisted in the program by choice, due to his high-ranking position and his high authority in the operations. He is practically the same as the Earth-616 version of Sabretooth, having accelerated healing and keen senses, with the exception that he has four adamantium claws surgically implanted in each arm in an attempt to one-up Wolverine after having many failures in the service of Weapon X. One of the adamantium claws implanted in his left forearm is broken.Ultimate X-Men #12 (January 2002) Exactly how and when this occurred has not been revealed. He has a burning hatred for Wolverine and also, as he stated in his encounter with him at Weapon X, for the primitive Homo sapiens. He feels that his cruel, psychopathic nature was merely a natural part of being a mutant. When Magneto attempted to destroy the world so that he could eradicate humans, Sabretooth asked him to kill as few animals as possible.Ultimate X-Men #30 (May 2003) He cruelly boasts of murdering Wolverine's wife and child, and then commenced battle with him outside the Weapon X compound. He initially had the upper hand, but Wolverine managed to score a critical hit, a stab to Sabretooth's groin, before driving him off the edge of a cliff. Following Sabretooth's loss to Wolverine, the Weapon X program was dismantled with Colonel Wraith being shot dead by Nick Fury. Sabretooth did not die from his encounter with Wolverine, but rather returned as a high-ranking follower to Magneto in the Brotherhood of Mutants. His encounter with Wolverine while with the Brotherhood was his final underestimation of his old enemy. After boasting that he can survive any wound or injury, and would always return to fight and haunt Wolverine, Wolverine gives a vicious retort: he decapitates Sabretooth on the spot, although the panel was partially covered, so that the full effect of the injury was not visible. Sabretooth was long thought dead until he resurfaces one night when Wolverine and Storm were leaving Nowhere Special (a pool hall). He is alive and well sporting a new scar around his neck, apparently from the decapitation he received from Wolverine when they last met. Sabretooth explains that his head had remained partially attached to his body via strands of tissue and blood vessels, which allowed him to survive in a comatose state while his body regenerated. He also made one startling revelation: Wolverine is his biological father. Sabretooth then attempts to obtain a tissue sample so that Dr. Cornelius can clone a new Wolverine. During the beginning of the \\"Aftermath\\" arc, Sabretooth tells Wolverine that he is Wolverine's son. He also wants to help Wolverine search for his wife, Sabretooth's mother, although Wolverine claims that his scent proves that this is not true.Ultimate X-Men profile at IGN Sabretooth made a one-panel cameo in the \\"Magical\\" arc, standing outside the Xavier Institute while hiding behind a tree, with a look of sorrow on his face. In Ultimates 3Ultimates 3 #3 and Ultimatum, Sabretooth is shown to use his claws as weapons (like the main Marvel Universe version of Sabretooth) instead of his four adamantium claws. No canon explanation has been given for this change. Sabretooth alongside Juggernaut were recruited by Rogue and Wraith to help fight Magneto. He kills Angel, before being shot in the eye by Hawkeye.Ultimatum #4 In Ultimatum #5, he is shown pulling Mystique off of Magneto's citadel before the lower levels explode. They are later seen as part of Quicksilver's new Brotherhood in Wundagore.Ultimate Comics: Ultimate X #1-5 X-Men Forever In, X-Men Forever, Chris Claremont's continuation of his run on X-Men (non-canonical to the mainstream timeline and taking place in the 161 Marvel Universe), Sabretooth is established as Wolverine's father. He attacks the X-Mansion, but is blinded by Storm, as well as losing one hand and having his healing factor shut down. He subsequently joins the X-Men to honor his son, using his still- enhanced senses to compensate for his lack of vision, and a bionic replacement for his hand. It is also revealed that the Sabretooth that fought alongside the Marauders is a clone made by Sinister; the true Sabretooth, while initially villainous, is less psychotic and as such is able to truly reform. The two Sabretooths do battle on one occasion. X-Factor Forever Sabretooth appears in Louise Simonson and Dan Panosian's five issue run on X-Factor Forever. Age of X In the Age of X reality, it was revealed that Sabretooth has been captured by the Sapiens League and paraded down the streets as a dangerous mutant as shown in Tempo's memory.X-Men: Legacy #245 He was later used by the Avengers to track other mutants- his jaw removed and replaced with metal joints, his words suggesting that whatever caused this injury left him with brain damage - under the codename 'Weapon S', but the Hulk kills him after leading them to the fortress as his head is crushed.Age of X Universe #1 Wolverine MAX In the 2012 series Wolverine MAX, Logan is shown to be living in Japan as a monk when he first meets a blond, older man calling himself \\"Victor\\". Victor tells Logan that he is \\"just like him\\". When Logan refuses to accept Victor's claim as truth, Victor responds by saying \\"Okay then, I'll just have to prove it\\", before hurling the former into a nearby tree, proving his superhuman strength.Wolverine MAX (Vol.1) #01 (December 2012). p. 17. panel 6, and p. 18. panel 1-2.

Despite the animosity between the two of them—made even worse when Stryker reveals that (contrary to their deal) Victor cannot merge adamantium to his skeleton because it would kill him—the brothers fight together to defeat Weapon XI, Victor explaining his reasons as being that only he gets to kill Wolverine, subsequently departing when the battle is over. * The character was originally to appear in the 2017 film Logan.Liev Schreiber confirmed via Twitter that he had personally been invited for the project of Logan during development. Writer Scott Frank revealed that early versions of the script included the character but was removed from the final screenplay, stating \\"There was a moment when we were thinking about, as I recall, Jim [Mangold] had an idea where when they were on the run, and they go to the gambling town, there may have been at that point they were going to see [Victor Creed] for help. He was going to be there for help. Now that you mention it! I wouldn't swear to it, but we thought that would have been an interesting thing to do. And then for whatever reason we didn't do it.\\" Director James Mangold explained the decision to cut certain characters from the screenplay by stating \\"There were times early on in the story where I played with the idea of [Hugh Jackman] coming along, and I don't want to give away anything, but I played with there being an underground railroad where there were a couple of other mutants that [Logan] met on the journey. It always seemed to detract from the loneliness of the story though and became a kind of cameo.\\" Schreiber later elaborated \\"There was an invitation early on from Hugh (and director James Mangold) and I would have loved to work on it. It was very difficult given [the schedule of Ray Donovan], and I think they went a different direction as well with story.\\"https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1631149/what-logan-was-planning-to-do- with-sabretooth Animation * Sabretooth appears in the Wolverine part of Hulk Vs, voiced by Mark Acheson. Sabretooth appears as a member of Weapon X employed by Professor Thornton. He first appears when Wolverine and the Hulk are shot with tranquilizer darts by Deadpool. He then punches out Wolverine and carries him off to the laboratory. Sabretooth then forcefully punches Wolverine awake when Professor Thornton enters where they are holding Wolverine. Later, he confronts Wolverine after his escape from the cell with Professor Thornton and Lady Deathstrike. Annoyed by Professor Thornton, he slashes him in the back (but not fatally) while he is talking to Lady Deathstrike and blames it on Wolverine when the others arrive as they have similar claw marks (although Deadpool realizes he lied). He, along with Lady Deathstrike and Omega Red, face off against Wolverine and eventually to defeat him. Soon, Bruce Banner transforms into the Hulk, (triggered by the stab wound Wolverine left him) and punches Sabretooth out of the laboratory, knocking him out for the rest of the battle. He was later seen lying in the snow unconscious as Hulk and Wolverine finish their fight. Video games * Sabretooth was the final boss in the NES video game Wolverine. * Sabretooth appeared in the Capcom fighting games X-Men vs. Street Fighter and Marvel vs. Capcom 2, voiced by Don Francks.

He first appears as a hologram in the Danger Room, and later fully appears near the final act, where he and Magneto join forces with the X-Men to defeat the Sentinel thereat. However, Magneto soon betrays the X-Men and sends Sabretooth into the Master Mold to retrieve Jason Stryker, whom Magneto hopes to recruit into the Brotherhood of Mutants. Sabretooth has a rematch with Wolverine inside the gigantic Sentinel factory, and is once again defeated when Wolverine impales him and has him fall off the monument. Sabretooth's name also appears in Stryker's base above a cell door in the first act of the game, which is a nod to fans of the character, because, at the time, the character was rumored to be receiving an adamantium skeleton like Wolverine. * Sabretooth appears as a boss in X-Men Legends, voiced by Peter Lurie.

It was part of Black's first book, an anthology of essays entitled The Abolition of Work and Other Essays published by Loompanics Unlimited. It is an exposition of Black's \\"type 3 anarchism\\" – a blend of post-Situationist theory and individualist anarchism – focusing on a critique of the work ethic. Black draws upon certain ideas of Marshall Sahlins, Richard Borshay Lee, Charles Fourier, William Morris, and Paul Goodman. Although \\"The Abolition of Work\\" has most often been reprinted by anarchist publishers and Black is well known as an anarchist, the essay's argument is not explicitly anarchist. Black argues that the abolition of work is as important as the abolition of the state. The essay, which is based on a 1981 speech at the Gorilla Grotto in San Francisco, is informal and without academic references, but Black mentions some sources such as the utopian socialist Charles Fourier, the unconventional Marxists Paul Lafargue and William Morris, anarchists such as Peter Kropotkin and Paul Goodman, and anthropologists such as Marshall Sahlins and Richard Borshay Lee. Synopsis In the essay Black argues for the abolition of the producer- and consumer-based society, where, Black contends, all of life is devoted to the production and consumption of commodities. Attacking Marxist state socialism as much as liberal capitalism, Black argues that the only way for humans to be free is to reclaim their time from jobs and employment, instead turning necessary subsistence tasks into free play done voluntarily – an approach referred to as \\"ludic\\". The essay argues that \\"no-one should ever work\\", because work - defined as compulsory productive activity enforced by economic or political means – is the source of most of the misery in the world. Black denounces work for its compulsion, and for the forms it takes – as subordination to a boss, as a \\"job\\" which turns a potentially enjoyable task into a meaningless chore, for the degradation imposed by systems of work- discipline, and for the large number of work-related deaths and injuries – which Black characterizes as homicide. He views the subordination enacted in workplaces as \\"a mockery of freedom\\", and denounces as hypocrites the various theorists who support freedom while supporting work. Subordination in work, Black alleges, makes people stupid and creates fear of freedom. Because of work, people become accustomed to rigidity and regularity, and do not have the time for friendship or meaningful activity. Many workers, he contends, are dissatisfied with work (as evidenced by absenteeism, goldbricking, embezzlement and sabotage), so that what he says should be uncontroversial; however, it is controversial only because people are too close to the work- system to see its flaws. Play, in contrast, is not necessarily rule-governed, and, more important, it is performed voluntarily, in complete freedom, for the satisfaction of engaging in the activity itself. But since intrinsically satisfying activity is not necessarily unproductive, \\"productive play\\" is possible, and, if generalized, might give rise to a gift economy. Black points out that hunter-gatherer societies are typified by play (in the sense of \\"productive play\\"), a view he backs up with the work of anthropologist Marshall Sahlins in his essay \\"The Original Affluent Society,\\" reprinted in his book \\"Stone Age Economics\\" (1971). Black has reiterated this interpretation of the ethnographic record, this time with citations and references, in \\"Primitive Affluence,\\" reprinted in his book \\"Friendly Fire\\" (Autonomedia 1994), and in \\"Nightmares of Reason\\" (a critique of Murray Bookchin posted at TheAnarchistLibrary.org). Black responds to the criticism (argued, for instance, by libertarian David Ramsey-Steele) that \\"work,\\" if not simply effort or energy, is necessary to get important but unpleasant tasks done, by contending that much work now currently done is unnecessary, because it only serves the purposes of social control and economic exploitation. Black has responded that most important tasks can be rendered ludic or \\"salvaged\\" by being turned into game-like and craft-like activities, and secondly that the vast majority of work does not need doing at all. The latter tasks are unnecessary because they only serve functions of commerce and social control that exist only to maintain the work-system as a whole. As for what is left, he advocates Charles Fourier's approach of arranging activities so that people will want to do them. He is also sceptical but open-minded about the possibility of eliminating work through labor-saving technologies, which, in his opinion, have so far never reduced work, and often deskilled and debased workers. As he sees it, the political left has, for the most part, failed to acknowledge as revolutionary the critique of work, limiting itself to the critique of wage-labor. The left, he contends, by glorifying the dignity of labor, has endorsed work itself, and also the work ethic. Black has often criticized leftism, especially Marxism, but he does not consider anarchism, which he espouses, as always advocating an understanding of work which is consistent with his critique of work. Black looks favorably, if critically, on a text such as \\"The Right to Be Greedy\\", by the Situationist-influenced collective For Ourselves (he wrote a Preface for the Loompanics Unlimited reprint edition), which attempts to synthesize the post-moral individualism of Max Stirner (\\"The Ego and Its Own\\") with what appears to be an egalitarian anarcho-communism. What has been called \\"zero-work\\" remains controversial on the left and among anarchists. \\"The Abolition of Work\\" has been reprinted, as the first essay of \\"Instead of Work,\\" published by LBC Books in 2015. Eight more essays follow, including an otherwise unpublished, lengthy essay, \\"Afterthoughts on the Abolition of Work.\\" The introduction is by Bruce Sterling. Influence and reception \\"The Abolition of Work\\" was a significant influence on futurist and design critic Bruce Sterling, who at the time was a leading cyberpunk science fiction author and called it \\"one of the seminal underground documents of the 1980s\\". The essay's critique of work formed the basis for the antilabour faction in Sterling's 1988 novel Islands in the Net. \\"The Abolition of Work\\" has been widely reprinted. It has been translated into French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese (both continental Portuguese and Luso-Brazilian), Swedish, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian, Esperanto, Catalan, Azari (the language of Azerbaijan), and probably other languages.

Peter I (; c. 118726 May 1250), also known as Peter Mauclerc, was Duke of Brittany jure uxoris from 1213 to 1221, and regent of the duchy for his minor son John I from 1221 to 1237. As duke he was also 1st Earl of Richmond from 1218 to 1235. Origins Peter was the second son of Robert II, Count of Dreux and Yolande de Coucy. The latter was in turn the son of Robert I, Count of Dreux, a younger brother of Louis VII of France. Peter was thus a Capetian, a second cousin of Louis VIII of France. Despite being of royal descent, as the younger son of a cadet branch Peter's early prospects were that of a minor noble, with a few scattered fiefs in the Île-de-France and Champagne. He was initially destined for a career in the clergy, which he later renounced, earning him the nickname Mauclerc (French: mauvais clerc, bad-cleric). He broke the convention of ecclesiastical heraldry by placing on the canton of his paternal arms the ermine, then reserved for the clergy.  Accession  In 1212 King Philip II of France needed to find a weak and faithful ruler for Brittany. The duchy lay athwart the sea lanes between England and the English territories in Gascony. Furthermore, it bordered on Anjou and Normandy, which the English had lost ten or twelve years before and were eager to recover. It was being ruled with less than a strong hand by Guy of Thouars, as regent for his young daughter Alix. Also worrisome was that Alix's older half-sister Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany, was in an English prison. King Philip thus broke off the betrothal of Alix and the Breton lord Henry of Penthièvre, and turned to his French cousin Peter, then in his early twenties. Peter married Alix, and on 27 January 1213, paid homage to the king for Brittany. There is some ambiguity regarding whether Peter should be considered duke or count. The duchy was legally held by his wife. The King of France and the Pope (and their courts) always addressed him as count, but Peter in his own charters called himself duke.  Relations with the English  In 1214 King John of England had assembled a formidable coalition against the French. He landed in Poitou while King Otto of Germany prepared to invade from the north. John chased off some French forces in the north of Poitou, and then moved to the southern edge of Brittany, opposite Nantes. Peter drove him off after a brief skirmish but did nothing to hinder John's subsequent movement up the Loire valley where he took a few Breton fortresses and then besieged La Roche-aux-Moines. John's Poitevin vassals, however, refused to fight against a French force led by the King of France's son Louis. Meanwhile, Otto's army was crushed at Bouvines, and the entire invasion foundered. It is not clear why John attempted to capture Nantes, even less why he would do so the hardest way, via the very well- defended bridge across the Loire. Nor is it clear why Peter declined to harass his forces from the rear as John marched east. A likely explanation is that the two had come to some sort of agreement whereby John would leave Brittany alone for the moment, and in return the Bretons would not hinder him elsewhere. John had a prize he could dangle in front of Peter: the Earldom of Richmond. This great English honour (land) had traditionally been held by the dukes of Brittany, and in fact a constant theme in Peter's political affairs was the desire to hold and retain the English revenues from Richmond. Peter of Dreux Peter did not yield to King John's offers to accept the earldom and take up the King's side in his conflicts with the English barons, probably because he deemed the King's prospects too uncertain. Moreover, Louis was again fighting against the English. But when Louis was defeated, Peter was sent as one of the negotiators for a peace treaty. After the negotiations were completed (in 1218), William Marshal, the regent for the young Henry III of England, recognized Peter as Earl of Richmond, in place of Eleanor of Brittany who, as a potential threat to English crown, would never be released from imprisonment. The center of the earldom's properties in Yorkshire was in the hands of the Earl of Chester, whom the regent could not afford to antagonize, but Peter did receive the properties of the earldom outside of Yorkshire, which in fact generated the bulk of the earldom's income. In 1219 he participated in the capture of Marmande and the Siege of Toulouse during the Albigensian Crusade.  Consolidation of power  Peter turned his attention to his next goal. The authority of the dukes of Brittany had traditionally been weak, in comparison to the great peers of northern France. For example, the duke could not limit the building of castles by his counts. Nor did he have the right to guardianship of minor heirs of his vassals. Peter aimed to re-establish his relationship with his vassals (or subjects) more along the lines of what he knew from the Capetian royal court. To that end Peter simply declared new rules by fiat, and then faced the inevitable turmoil that resulted from the reaction of his barons. There followed a series of small civil wars and political maneuverings. In 1222 he suppressed a revolt by Breton barons in the Battle of Châteaubriant. By 1223, the barons had all acquiesced to the changes or been dispossessed. The six Breton bishops were the other threat to the ducal power, for they had substantial landholdings (including control of all or part of the few cities in Brittany), and were recalcitrant in the face of Peter's attempts to raise revenues by increasing taxes or simply taking possession of episcopal holdings. For this he was excommunicated for a time in 1219-1221\\\\. Peter submitted in the end, but this was not to be the last of his conflict with the bishops.  Regency  Peter's wife died on 21 October 1221, leaving behind four young children. She was then only 21, and little is known about her beyond the basic genealogical facts. Her death meant that Peter was no longer duke, although he continued to rule the Duchy with undiminished authority, as regent for his son John, then a boy of four or so. Alix's death changed Peter's goals in two ways. First, he aimed to acquire some additional territory, not part of the Duchy, to augment his retirement after his son came of age. Second, there was a strong tradition in France that a minor heir should, when coming of age, have his property in the state it was in when he inherited it. Thus Peter could not now take some risks without fear of harming the prospects of his son. Peter helped Philip II's successor, Louis VIII, in his fight against Henry III of England (in the sieges of Niort and La Rochelle in 1224). He also accompanied Louis VIII by joining the Albigensian Crusade, but with the latter's death, he participated, with Count Theobald IV of Champagne and Count Hugh X of La Marche, in rebellions against the regent Blanche of Castile, between 1227 and 1234. Around this time he renounced his allegiance to the king of England and suffered forfeiture of his English earldom.  Crusades and death  Peter's son John reached the age of majority in 1237. Peter Mauclerc then participated in the Barons' Crusade to the Holy Land in 1239. While there, Peter's troops along with some local knights were attacked by heavily armed Mamluk cavalry, firing their bows, but the crusader force managed to outflank and defeat them, taking a few prisoners with them back to Jaffa. In early November, two days into a march from Acre to Ascalon, Peter and his lieutenant Raoul de Soissons split off from the main force to conduct a raid. They divided their force in half and each waited in ambush along a possible route for the Muslim caravan which was moving up the Jordan to Damascus. Peter's half clashed with the Muslims outside of a castle, and after some fighting, he sounded his horn to summon Raoul. The Muslims were routed and fled inside the castle, where Peter's men followed them, killed many, took some captives, and seized the booty and edible animals of the caravan. This minor victory would soon be overshadowed by a serious defeat at Gaza. Back in France, he won some success against the English at sea in 1242 and 1243. In 1249, he participated in the Seventh Crusade to Egypt under King Louis IX. He died at the sea before he was able to return home. He was buried in Braine, France. Marriages and children Braisne Abbey in Aisne, Saint-Yved de Braine, the necropolis of the Counts of Dreux where Peter I is buried. Peter was married three times: His first wife was Alix of Thouars, Duchess of Brittany (1201-1221). Alix and Peter had three children: *John I (to 1217-1286), duke of Brittany; *Yolande of Brittany (1218-10/10/1272), married (January 1236) to Hugh XI of Lusignan, Seigneur de Lusignan, Count of la Marche and Angoulême *Arthur of Brittany (1220-1224) His second wife was Nicole (died February 1232). Nicole and Peter had a son: *Oliver de Braine (1231-1279), who inherited the Lordship of Machecoul (became Oliver I of Machecoul and founded the Machecoul branch of the House of Dreux). His third wife was Marguerite de Montaigu, Lady of Montaigu, Commequiers, La Garnache then Machecoul, and widow of Hugh I de Thouars (died 1230), a brother to Guy of Thouars; this made Marguerite a paternal line aunt of Alix. They married by 1236, and had no issue. Ancestry Notes References Bibliography * * * Further reading *Painter, Sidney. The Scourge of the Clergy: Peter of Dreux, Duke of Brittany.

He is currently Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Anthropology and of Social Sciences at the University of Chicago.Moore, Jerry D. 2009. \\"Marshall Sahlins: Culture Matters\\" in Visions of Culture: an Introduction to Anthropological Theories and Theorists, Walnut Creek, California: Altamira, pp. 365-385. Biography Sahlins was born in Chicago. He was of Russian Jewish descent but grew up in a secular, non-practicing family. His family claims to be descended from Baal Shem Tov, a mystical rabbi considered to be the founder of Hasidic Judaism. Sahlin's mother admired Emma Goldman and was a political activist as a child in Russia. Sahlins received his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees at the University of Michigan where he studied with evolutionary anthropologist Leslie White. He earned his PhD at Columbia University in 1954. There his intellectual influences included Eric Wolf, Morton Fried, Sidney Mintz, and the economic historian Karl Polanyi. After receiving his PhD, he returned to teach at the University of Michigan. In the 1960s he became politically active, and while protesting against the Vietnam War, Sahlins coined the term for the imaginative form of protest now called the \\"teach-in,\\" which drew inspiration from the sit-in pioneered during the civil rights movement. In 1968, Sahlins signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968, New York Post In the late 1960s, he also spent two years in Paris, where he was exposed to French intellectual life (and particularly the work of Claude Lévi-Strauss) and the student protests of May 1968. In 1973, he took a position in the anthropology department at the University of Chicago, where he is currently the Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor of Anthropology Emeritus. His commitment to activism has continued throughout his time at Chicago, most recently leading to his protest over the opening of the University's Confucius Institute (which later closed in the fall of 2014). On February 23, 2013, Sahlins resigned from the National Academy of Sciences to protest the call for military research for improving the effectiveness of small combat groups and also the election of Napoleon Chagnon. The resignation followed the publication in that month of Chagnon's memoir and widespread coverage of the memoir, including a profile of Chagnon in the New York Times magazine.Serena Golden, \\"A Protest Resignation\\", Inside Higher Ed, February 25, 2013.David Price, \\"The Destruction of Conscience in the National Academy of Sciences: An Interview with Marshall Sahlins\\", CounterPunch, February 26, 2013. Alongside his research and activism, Sahlins trained a host of students who went on to become prominent in the field. One such student, Gayle Rubin, said: \\"Sahlins is a mesmerizing speaker and a brilliant thinker. By the time he finished the first lecture, I was hooked.\\"Rubin, Gayle. Deviations: Gayle Rubin Reader. Durham: Duke University Press, 2011, p. 24. In 2001, Sahlins became publisher of Prickly Pear Pamphlets, which was started in 1993 by anthropologists Keith Hart and Anna Grimshaw, and was renamed Prickly Paradigm Press. The imprint specializes in small pamphlets on unconventional subjects in anthropology, critical theory, philosophy, and current events. His brother was the writer and comedian Bernard Sahlins (1922–2013). His son, Peter Sahlins, is a historian. Work Sahlins is known for theorizing the interaction of structure and agency, his critiques of reductive theories of human nature (economic and biological, in particular), and his demonstrations of the power that culture has to shape people's perceptions and actions. Although his focus has been the entire Pacific, Sahlins has done most of his research in Fiji and Hawaii. Early work Sahlins's training under Leslie White, a proponent of materialist and evolutionary anthropology at the University of Michigan, is reflected in his early work. In his Evolution and Culture (1960), he touched on the areas of cultural evolution and neoevolutionism. He divided the evolution of societies into \\"general\\" and \\"specific\\". General evolution is the tendency of cultural and social systems to increase in complexity, organization and adaptiveness to environment. However, as the various cultures are not isolated, there is interaction and a diffusion of their qualities (like technological inventions). This leads cultures to develop in different ways (specific evolution), as various elements are introduced to them in different combinations and on different stages of evolution. Moala, Sahlins's first major monograph, exemplifies this approach. Contributions to economic anthropology Stone Age Economics (1972) collects some of Sahlins's key essays in substantivist economic anthropology. As opposed to \\"formalists,\\" substantivists insist that economic life is produced through cultural rules that govern the production and distribution of goods, and therefore any understanding of economic life has to start from cultural principles, and not from the assumption that the economy is made up of independently acting, \\"economically rational\\" individuals. Perhaps Sahlins's most famous essay from the collection, \\"The Original Affluent Society,\\" elaborates on this theme through an extended meditation on \\"hunter-gatherer\\" societies. Stone Age Economics inaugurated Sahlins's persistent critique of the discipline of economics, particularly in its Neoclassical form. Contributions to historical anthropology After the publication of Culture and Practical Reason in 1976, his focus shifted to the relation between history and anthropology, and the way different cultures understand and make history. Of central concern in this work is the problem of historical transformation, which structuralist approaches could not adequately account for. Sahlins developed the concept of the \\"structure of the conjuncture\\" to grapple with the problem of structure and agency, in other words that societies were shaped by the complex conjuncture of a variety of forces, or structures. Earlier evolutionary models, by contrast, claimed that culture arose as an adaptation to the natural environment. Crucially, in Sahlins's formulation, individuals have the agency to make history. Sometimes their position gives them power by placing them at the top of a political hierarchy. At other times, the structure of the conjuncture, a potent or fortuitous mixture of forces, enables people to transform history. This element of chance and contingency makes a science of these conjunctures impossible, though comparative study can enable some generalizations. Historical Metaphors and Mythical Realities (1981), Islands of History (1985), Anahulu (1992), and Apologies to Thucydides (2004) contain his main contributions to historical anthropology. Islands of History sparked a notable debate with Gananath Obeyesekere over the details of Captain James Cook's death in the Hawaiian Islands in 1779. At the heart of the debate was how to understand the rationality of indigenous people. Obeyesekere insisted that indigenous people thought in essentially the same way as Westerners and was concerned that any argument otherwise would paint them as \\"irrational\\" and \\"uncivilized\\". In contrast Sahlins argued that each culture may have different types of rationality that make sense of the world by focusing on different patterns and explain them within specific cultural narratives, and that assuming that all cultures lead to a single rational view is a form of eurocentrism. Centrality of culture Over the years, Sahlins took aim at various forms of economic determinism (mentioned above) and also biological determinism, or the idea that human culture is a by-product of biological processes. His major critique of sociobiology is contained in The Use and Abuse of Biology. His recent book, What Kinship Is—And Is Not picks up some of these threads to show how kinship organizes sexuality and human reproduction rather than the other way around. In other words, biology does not determine kinship. Rather, the experience of \\"mutuality of being\\" that we call kinship is a cultural phenomenon.
