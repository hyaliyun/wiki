While the calculations differ, they all attempt to measure the return from deploying a private equity fund's cash flows into a stock market index. ==Long-Nickels PME== The first PME measure was proposed by Austin M. Long and Craig J. Nickels in 1996. The analysis is referred in the industry as Long Nickels PME, LN-PME, PME, or ICM. Long and Nickels stated that they preferred the acronym ICM (Index Comparison Method):Inside Private Equity : The professional Investor Handbook by Kocis, Bachman, Long and Nickels, page 157 The ICM is also known as the Public Market Equivalent (PME). We prefer the term ICM, because it better describes the methodology, which is not limited to the use of a public market index to calculate its results The PME analysis is covered under US patent 7058583 ===Methodology=== Long and Nickels compared the performance of a private equity fund with the S&P500; Index by creating a theoretical investment into the S&P; using the Private Equity fund cashflows : * When paying a capital call, we assume that the same amount is used to 'buy the index' * When receiving a distribution, we assume that the same amount of the index is sold. As the index price evolves, the value of the theoretical amount invested in the index changes. When receiving a valuation for the fund, we can then compare the value of the fund investment to the theoretical value of the index investment. {  -  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"Period  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Cashflows  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Index  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Index Performance  style=\\"text- align:center; \\"Theoretical Investment -  p1  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" -100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"0.00%  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"100 -  p2  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" -50  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"105  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"5.00%  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"155 -  p3  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 60  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"115  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"9.52%  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"109.76 -  p4  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  10  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  117  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  1.74%  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  101.67 -   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" -  style=\\"text-align:left; background:#f0f0f0;\\" Valuation (p5)  style=\\"text- align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\" 110  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 120  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"2.56%  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\" 104.28 -  style=\\"text-align:left; background:#f0f0f0;\\" IRR  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"  6.43%  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\" PME  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"  5.30% - } Negative cashflows are treated as contributions. On the first period, a $100 call in the fund is matched by a $100 investment into the index. On the second period, the $100 index investment is now worth $105, to which is added $50 of new investment. A positive cashflow is treated by decreasing the index investment by the same value. On the valuation period, we compare the valuation received from the fund to the value of the theoretical investment. The PME IRR is obtained by computing an IRR with the index valuation as the final cashflow. The Long Nickels PME tells how an equivalent investment in the public market would have performed. This then needs to be compared to the actual IRR of the fund. In the above example, the IRR is 1.13 percentage points above the PME, which means that the private fund outperformed the public index. The difference between the IRR and the PME is called the IRR spread. ===Formula=== The PME is an IRR on the cashflows of the investment, using as final cashflow an adjusted PME NAV. NAV_{PME} = \\\\sum_s^T C_s \\\\times \\\\cfrac{I_T}{I_s} Where : C_s is the cashflow from the investment at date s, positive for a contribution, negative for a distribution I_s is the value of the index at date s then : PME = IRR(C_s,NAV_{PME}) ===Limitation=== As stated in Long and Nickels paper: If a private investment greatly outperforms the index because it makes frequent, large distributions, it is possible for the final value determined by the index comparison to be negative. In effect, the frequent large withdrawals from the index result in a net short position in the index comparison This can be simulated in the previous example by having a period where the fund distributes a large amount and the index dives : {   style=\\"text-align:left; \\" Period  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Cashflows  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Index  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Index Performance  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Theoretical Investment -  p1  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" -100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0.00%  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 100 -  p2  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" -50  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 105  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 5.00%  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 155 -  p3  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 60  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 115  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 9.52%  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 109.76 -  p4  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -13.04%  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -4.55 -   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"   style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  -  style=\\"text-align:left; background:#f0f0f0;\\"  Valuation (p5)  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\" 20  style=\\"text- align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\" 120  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 20%  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\" -5.47 -  style=\\"text- align:left; background:#f0f0f0;\\"  IRR  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"  7.77%  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"   style=\\"text- align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"  PME  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"  1.34% - } When the final valuation of the theoretical investment is negative, the IRR formula for the PME may not return any results. Even if a PME can be calculated, while the investment stays negative, every increase in the index will be interpreted as a hit in the performance of the theoretical investment : on the above example, the value of the index went back up to 120, which had a negative impact on the value of the theoretical investment. Even if the investment eventually goes back into positive values and a PME can be computed, the time spent under 0 will be improperly taken into account. The next methods by Rouvinez, and Kaplan and Schoar are partly designed to address this issue. ==PME+== The PME+ was initially described in 2003 by Christophe Rouvinez in a paper Private Equity Benchmarking with PME+. It is written to resolve a common issue of the Long Nickels PME : an investment outperforming the index will yield a negative value in the index theoretical investment. ===PME+ Methodology=== Instead of modifying the NAV of the investment, the PME+ discount every distribution by a factor computed so that the NAV of the index investment matches the NAV of the fund. {  - f0f0f0;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"Period  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Cashflows  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Index  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Theoretical Contributions  style=\\"text- align:center; \\"Discounted Distributions  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Discounted Cashflows -  p1  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"-100  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"100  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"0  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"-100 -  p2  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"-50  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"105  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"50  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"0  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"-50 -  p3  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"60  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"115  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 51.63  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 51.63 -  p4  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 100  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  86.05  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  86.05 -   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" -  style=\\"text-align:left; background:#f0f0f0;\\" Valuation (p5)  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"20  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"120  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text- align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"20 -   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text- align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"Lambda  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"0.86 -  style=\\"text-align:left; background:#f0f0f0;\\" IRR  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\" 7.77%  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\" PME+  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"  2.05% - } Like the Long Nickels PME, the PME+ needs to be compared to the IRR. An IRR outperforming the PME means that the fund outperformed the public index. ===PME+ Formula=== Using Henly Notation in PME Benchmarking Method: NAV_{PME+,T} = \\\\sum_{s=0}^t (contribution_s - \\\\lambda_T . distribution_s).\\\\cfrac{I_t}{I_s} where \\\\lambda_T = \\\\cfrac{(S_c - NAV_{PE,T})}{S_d} and S_c = \\\\sum_{s=0}^T(contribution_s.\\\\cfrac{I_T}{I_s}) S_d = \\\\sum_{s=0}^T(distribution_s.\\\\cfrac{I_T}{I_s}) In other words, lambda is chosen so that : NAV_{PME+,T} = NAV_{PE,T} The IRR is then calculated using as cashflows : PME+_T = IRR(Contributions, \\\\lambda_T.Distributions, NAV_{PE,T}) == Modified PME == The modified PME (or mPME) method was released by Cambridge Associates in October 2013. It provides an alternate way to tackle the negative NAV limitation of the LN-PME. Like the LN-PME and the PME+, the mPME consider an hypothetical public investment whose performance follows the public benchmark. Each contribution in the private investment is matched by an equal contribution in the public investment. However, rather than subtracting the distributed amounts from the public investment, we compute the weight of the distribution in the private investment, and remove the same weight from the public one. {  - f0f0f0;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left; \\"Period  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Call  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Dist  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"NAV  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Index  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Theoretical Contributions  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Distribution Weight  style=\\"text- align:center; \\"Theoretical NAV  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Weighted Distributions  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"Net CF -  p1  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"0  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"100  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"0  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"0  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"-100 -  p2  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"50  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"165  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"105  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"50  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"0  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"155  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"0  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"-50 -  p3  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"0  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"60  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"125  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"115  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"0  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"0.32  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 114.70  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"55  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"55.06 -  p4  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 15  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0.87  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  13.01  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 87  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 86.73 -  style=\\"text-align:left; background:#f0f0f0;\\" Valuation (p5)  style=\\"text- align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"20  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"120  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 15.61  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 15.61 -  style=\\"text- align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"IRR  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"7.77%  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  style=\\"text- align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\"mPME  style=\\"text-align:right; background:#f0f0f0;\\" 2.02% } ===Formula=== For each distribution, a distribution weight is calculated D_{weight,t} = \\\\cfrac{D_t}{D_t + NAV_t} The NAV of the theoretical investment is then calculated as : NAV_{mPME,t} = (1-D_{weight,t}) \\\\times (NAV_{mPME,t-1}*\\\\cfrac{I_t}{I_{t-1}}+Call_t) The weighted Distribution is given by : Dist_{mPME,t} = (D_{weight,t}) \\\\times (NAV_{mPME,t-1}*\\\\cfrac{I_t}{I_{t-1}}+Call_t) IRR_{mPME} = IRR(Call,Dist_{mPME},NAV_{mPME,T}) == Kaplan Schoar PME == Kaplan Schoar PME was first described in 2005 by Steve Kaplan and Antoinette Schoar. While the Long Nickels PME returns an IRR, the Kaplan Schoar PME (or KS-PME) returns a market multiple. A simple explanation of its computation is described into Sorensen & Jagannathan paper: Let X(t) denote the cash flow from the fund to the LP at time t. This total cash-flow stream is divided into its positive and negative parts, called distributions (dist(t)) and capital calls (call(t)). Distributions are the cash flows returned to the LP from the PE fund (net of fees) when the fund successfully sells a company. Capital calls are the LP‚Äôs investments into the fund, including the payment of ongoing management fees. The distributions and capital calls are then valued by discounting them using the realized market returns over the same time period, and the [KS-]PME is the ratio of the two resulting values: ===Formula=== When considering an investment at time T. The KS-PME first considers the current valuation of the investment as an distribution at date T. KS-PME is then defined as KS-PME = \\\\cfrac{FV(Dist)}{FV(Call)} with FV(Dist) = \\\\sum_t (dist(t) \\\\times \\\\cfrac{I_T}{I_t}) FV(Call) = \\\\sum_t(call(t) \\\\times \\\\cfrac{I_T}{I_t}) Using the previous example : {  -  style=\\"text-align:left; \\" Period  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Contribution  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Distribution  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Index  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" DPI  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"   style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Discounted Contribution  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Discounted Distribution  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" KS PME -  p1  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 120  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0 -  p2  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 50  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 105  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 57.14  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0 -  p3  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 60  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 115  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0.40  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 62.60  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0.35 -  p4  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 10  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 117  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0.47  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 10.26  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0.41 -  Valuation (p5)  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 110  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 120  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 1.20  style=\\"text- align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 0  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 110  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 1.03 } While the Long Nickels PME needs to be compared to the actual IRR, the KS PME gives a direct indication of the performance of the fund compared to the performance of the index. A KS PME above 1 indicates that the fund overperformed the index. A KS PME below 1 indicates that the public index was a better investment than the fund. === Formula Simplification === The KS-PME formula can be simplified by removing I_T from the sums : KS-PME = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_t\\\\frac{dist(t)}{I_t}}{\\\\sum_t\\\\frac{call(t)}{I_t}} The Kaplan Schoar formula is independent of the time period used to forecast or discount the cashflows. This is an advantage over PME formulas that use an IRR calculations, whose final value will decrease over time. ===Usage=== The KS PME is the subject of a paper from the Columbia Business School assessing that The [Kaplan Schoar] PME provides a valid economic performance measure when the investor (\\"LP\\") has log-utility preferences and the return on the LP‚Äôs total wealth equals the market return. === Relation between LN-PME and KS-PME === In a 2008 paper The common Mathematical Foundation of ACG's ICM and AICM and the K&S; PME, Austin Long studies the mathematical link between LN PME and KS PME. Starting with KS PME formula : KS-PME = \\\\cfrac{FV(Dist)}{FV(Call)} From the LN-PME formula : NAV_{PME} = \\\\sum_t^T C_t \\\\cfrac{I_T}{I_t} NAV_{PME} = \\\\sum_t^T call(t) \\\\cfrac{I_T}{I_t} - \\\\sum_t^T dist(t) \\\\cfrac{I_T}{I_t} NAV_{PME} = FV(Call) - FV(Dist) By merging the two formulas : KS-PME = 1 - \\\\cfrac{NAV_{PME}}{FV(Call)} == Direct Alpha == The Direct Alpha was introduced on March 6, 2014 in a paper by Gredil, Oleg and Griffiths. It is deduced from the KS-PME calculation by computing an IRR using the discounted contributions and distributions, and take its natural logarithm. a = IRR(FV(C),FV(D), NAV_{PE}) \\\\alpha = \\\\cfrac{ln(1+a)}{\\\\Delta} with \\\\Delta being the time interval for which alpha is computed (usually in years) {  -  style=\\"text-align:left; \\" Period  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Cashflows  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Index  style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Index Performance  style=\\"text-align:center; \\"   style=\\"text-align:center; \\" Discounted Cashflows -  p1  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" -100  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 100  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 1.20  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -120 -  p2  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" -50  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 105  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 1.14  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -57.14 -  p3  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 60  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 115  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 1.04  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 62.60 -  p4  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 10  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 117  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 1.03  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 10.26 -  Valuation(p5)  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 110  style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 120  style=\\"text- align:right;\\" 1  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\\"   style=\\"text-align:right;\\" 110 -     a (IRR) : 1.09% -     Direct Alpha 1.08% } === Derivation === As an introduction, it is reminded that the computation of an IRR for the set of cashflows C_{0 \\\\ldots n} and final value NAV is done by solving r for : NAV_{PE} = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n{c_i\\\\cdot(1+r)^{n-i}} The direct alpha formula is derived from the definition of \\\\alpha in Modern portfolio theory. We define r, the rate of return, as the sum of a market return plus an alpha : r(t) = b(t) + \\\\alpha in the scope of direct alpha, we consider that r(t) and b(t) are continuous rate. Hence, the value of a cashflow c_i at time t_n is : v_i(t_n) = c_i\\\\cdot e^{\\\\int_{t_i}^{t_n}{(b(t)+\\\\alpha)dt}} using the benchmark values, we know that : \\\\frac{I_n}{I_i} = e^{\\\\int_{t_i}^{t_n}{b(t)dt}} Hence : v_i(t_n) = c_i\\\\cdot\\\\frac{I_n}{I_i}\\\\cdot e^{\\\\int_{t_i}^{t_n}{\\\\alpha dt}} by resolving the integral, and discretizing the time variable such as t_i = i\\\\Delta : v_i(t_n) = c_i\\\\cdot\\\\frac{I_n}{I_i}\\\\cdot e^{\\\\alpha\\\\cdot(n-i)\\\\Delta} We use this formula for every contribution in the private investment : NAV_{PE} = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n{c_i\\\\cdot\\\\frac{I_n}{I_i}\\\\cdot e^{\\\\alpha\\\\cdot(n-i)\\\\Delta}} Finally, we define a as 1 + a = e^{\\\\alpha\\\\cdot\\\\Delta} NAV_{PE} = \\\\sum_{i=0}^{n}{c_i\\\\cdot\\\\frac{I_n}{I_i}\\\\cdot(1+a)^{n-i}} This brings us back to a typical IRR formula. In other words, the direct alpha is calculated by computing an IRR with the benchmark discounted cashflows, and then computing \\\\alpha with \\\\alpha = \\\\cfrac{ln(1+a)}{\\\\Delta} ==Excess IRR== Different names for this methodology includes alpha, excess IRR, Implied Private Premium (\\"IPP\\") and PME Alpha. The first reference of the alpha was in a 2005 paper from Phalippou and Gottschalg and is simply named alpha, or excess IRR. The analysis is also explained in detail and named GEM Implied Private Premium (or \\"IPP\\") by Global Endowment Management ===Formula=== The excess IRR is calculated by resolving \\\\alpha in the following equation : NAV_{PE} = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n{c_i.((1+b_i)^{\\\\frac{1}{t_n-t_i}}+\\\\alpha)^{t_n-t_i}} with b_i = \\\\frac{I_n}{I_i} - 1 ===Methodology=== To calculate the Implied Private Premium, we compute the future values of a private investment's historical distributions and contributions. Each cash flow is compounded at a rate of return equaling the benchmark's annualized return plus the IPP. We then solve for the required IPP such that the PME ratio is set to one. IPP uses annual compounding to be consistent with other reporting methodologies and comparable to IRR. More specifically, the Implied Private Premium is solved numerically from 1=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n d_i (1 + b_{T_i, T_N} + r_{pp})^{T_N - T_i}}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n c_j (1 + b_{T_j, T_N} + r_{pp})^{T_N - T_j}}, where c_i and d_j are contributions and distributions at time T_i and T_j, respectively; b_{T_i,T_N} is the annualized benchmark return from time T_i to T_N, and r_{pp} is the IPP we are solving for. ===Derivation=== Starting with the definition of the IRR, which is computed by resolving r in NAV_{PE} = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n{c_i.(1+r)^{t_n-t_i}} we consider r as the sum of two components : r(t_i) = \\\\beta_{i,n} + \\\\alpha , with \\\\beta_{i,n} being the annually compounded benchmark performance between t_i and t_n. \\\\beta_{i,n} = (\\\\frac{I_n}{I_i})^\\\\frac{1}{t_n-t_i} - 1 \\\\beta_{i,n} = (1+b_i)^\\\\frac{1}{t_n- t_i} - 1 by replacing in the original equation : NAV_{PE} = \\\\sum_{i=0}^n{c_i.((1+b_i)^\\\\frac{1}{t_n-t_i}+\\\\alpha)^{t_n-t_i}} ===Comparison with Direct Alpha === The theoretical foundation of IPP is similar to that of Direct Alpha; however, the implementation details differ. The advantage of IPP is that it's an annually compounded, arithmetic excess return. This allows IPP to be directly comparable to generally accepted performance metrics such as IRR (also an annually compounded quantity). By contrast, the continuous direct alpha is not measured in the same unit as IRR, while the discrete direct alpha is a geometric excess return. ==Other PME analysis== Other less common PME analyses exists, usually as variation from either the Long Nickels PME or the Kaplan Schoar PME. Alignment Capital defines the Alternative ICM, or AICM as a variation from the Long Nickels PME : While ACG‚Äôs ICM calculation assumes that the capital invested into the index is a long position, the alternative index comparison method (AICM) assumes the opposite ‚Äì that is, the cash used to invest in the private market investment results, not from a source external to both the private market investment and the index, but from a short position in (i.e., a sale of) the index. Expressed in the same terms, the AICM calculation of the ending value of the index (the ending value used to calculate the AICM) is as follows: Value_{Index_{Ending}} = FV_{Returned} - FV_{Invested} In Valuing Private Equity, December 13, 2011, Sorensen, Wang and Yang defines an alternate PME based on the KS PME : There are three concerns with the standard PME measure. First, the denominator combines two types of cash flows, the investment I_0 and the management fees. Management fees are effectively a risk-free claim and should be discounted at a rate close to the risk-free rate. Second, the numerator contains the total proceeds net of carried interest. The carried interest is effectively a call option, making the LP's total payoff at maturity less risky than the underlying asset. Hence, it should be discounted at a lower rate than the underlying PE investment. Finally, the beta of the PE investment may not equal one. To address these concerns, we define the adjusted PME as follows : Adj. PME = \\\\cfrac{E[e^{-rT}(LP_1(A_t,T)+LP_2(A_T,T)+LP_3(A_T,T))]}{I_0+E[\\\\int_0^Te^{-rs}mX_0ds]} ==References== * Exposed to the J-Curve: Understanding and Managing Private Equity Fund Investments, Ulrich Grabenwarter & Tom Weidig, Chapter 5 Category:Private equity ","title":"Public Market Equivalent"},{"id":"42091504","text":"Mahimaganj () is a union parishad under Gobindaganj Upazila, Gaibandha District, Rangpur Division, Bangladesh.

In World War II it defended London during The Blitz and later served in the Burma Campaign. ==Origin== The Duke of York's Headquarters German air raids by Zeppelin airships and Gotha bombers on London and other British cities during World War I had shown the need for strong anti-aircraft (AA) defences in any future war. When the Territorial Army (TA) was reformed in 1922 it included a number of dedicated AA units of the Royal Artillery (RA). The second of these was 52nd (London) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, Royal Field Artillery (RFA), formed on 16 October 1922 and comprising 154th, 155th and 156th (London) AA Batteries. The Regimental Headquarters, 154 and 155 Batteries were at the Duke of York's Headquarters in Chelsea, London, while 156 Battery was based at Empress Hall, Ripple Lane, Barking. On 8 February 1923 the regiment was transferred to the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA), which had provided the AA batteries in World War I. However, on 1 June 1924 the RGA and RFA merged to become simply the Royal Artillery (RA). 156th (London) Bty was redesignated 156th (Barking) Bty in February 1926.Frederick, pp. 754‚Äì9, 768.Litchfield, p. 164. It formed part of 26th (London) Air Defence Brigade also headquartered at the Duke of York's Headquarters.Titles and Designations 1927. The original TA AA units were formed on a low peacetime establishment with a few old 3-inch guns on static mounts.Routledge, p. 40. Badge of the Royal Artillery above a door at a building of the former Duke of York's Headquarters in Chelsea, London As Britain's AA defences expanded during the 1930s, higher formations became necessary, and the 26th AD Bde (now renamed 26th (London) AA Group), including 52nd AA Bde, was assigned to 1st AA Division organised to cover London and the Home Counties. The Royal Garrison Artillery had been absorbed into the Royal Artillery (RA) in 1924; on 1 January 1938 the RA replaced its traditional unit designation 'Brigade' by the modern 'Regiment', and the 'AA Groups' reverted to the more usual formation title of 'Brigades'. Anti-Aircraft Command was formed in April 1939 to control all the TA's AA units and formations. By 1938, RHQ, 154 and 155 Batteries had moved from Chelsea to Artillery House, Horn Lane, in Acton, and were joined on 1 November 1938 by a new 271 AA Battery based at Brentford, replacing 156 (Barking) AA Battery, which had become part of a new 82nd (Essex) AA Regiment.Frederick, p. 776.Monthly Army List January 1938. ==Mobilisation== 3.7 inch gun in London in 1939. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis. The call-out of key parties by telephone and telegram went well, and they assembled at their drill halls within a few hours. Because the units possessed only a small scale of transport, elaborate plans had been made to requisition civilian vehicles, ranging from heavy lorries to buses and private cars. Equipment was drawn from mobilisation stores, and the detachments ferried out to their war stations. Despite some failures and problems, the emergency positions covering London were manned and most of the equipment was in place within 24 hours. The emergency mobilisation lasted nearly three weeks before the TA units were released on 14 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. The TA was doubled in size after the MunichCrisis, and 313 AA Battery was formed at Brentford and joined the regiment in April 1939. The deterioration in international relations during 1939 led to a partial mobilisation in June, and a proportion of TA AA units manned their war stations under a rotation system known as 'Couverture'. Full mobilisation of AA Command came on 28 August 1939, ahead of the declaration of war on 3 September 1939.Routledge, p. 65. ==World War II== 4.5-inch gun and crew of 52nd HAA Rgt, London, April 1941 On mobilisation, 52 AA Regiment was assigned to a newly formed 49 AA Bde in London. 313 AA Battery later served with the Regular 4 HAA Rgt in West AfricaAA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files52 HAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45 ===The Blitz=== On 1 June 1940, along with other AA units equipped with the older 3-inch and newer 3.7-inch and 4.5-inch AA guns, the 52nd was designated a Heavy AA Regiment.

The regiment sent a cadre to 205th HAA Training Regiment at Arborfield to provide the basis for a new 424 HAA Bty; this was formed on 24 April 1941 and joined the regiment on 22 July 1941. It had previously sent a cadre to 207th HAA Training Rgt at Devizes, which had formed 385 HAA Rgt on 14 November 1940 for 121st HAA Rgt. The regiment sent a third cadre to 209th HAA Training Regiment at Blandford to form 485 (Mixed) Bty on 25 September 1941, which joined 139th (Mixed) HAA Rgt.

In January 1942, 52 HAA Rgt transferred to 5 AA Bde, still in 9 AA Division.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80. ===Ceylon=== The regiment remained with 9 AA Division until March 1942, when it joined the War Office ReserveFarndale, Annex H, p. 281.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional units), 22 October 1941, 17 March 1942 Amendments, TNA files WO 212/6 and WO 33/1883. and then embarked for Ceylon, arriving at Colombo on 28 May and moving to Trincomalee a month later.Joslen, p. 519. 154 (London) Battery was stationed with East Africa Command in November 1942,Joslen, p. 491. and 29 March 1943 joined 56 (Cornwall) HAA Regt in Ceylon. In its place, 52 HAA Regt received 159 (Lloyds) Battery from 53 (City of London) HAA Regt. 52 HAA Regt came under the command of 23 AA Bde, while 155 and 271 Btys were at different times detached to 24 AA BdeRoutledge, Table XXXVIII, pp. 253‚Äì4. ===Burma=== On 23 November 1944, 52 HAA Regt embarked again and crossed to India to take part in the reconquest of Burma. It spent the whole of December travelling to Palel in Manipur on the Burmese border, where it came under XXXIII Corps in Fourteenth Army to join in the advance across the Chindwin River.Routledge, Table XXXIX, p. 255. Assigned to 11th (East Africa) Division, it moved east from Imphal to Tamu and down the 'pestilential' Kabaw Valley to the Chindwin to meet 5th (Indian) Division at Kalemyo. 11th EA Division with its AA support then moved north up the Chindwin to Kalewa, an important ferry centre which was to be the crossing site for XXXIII Corps. A bridgehead was secured and the engineers began building a 1100-foot Bailey bridge on pontoons. Japanese air attacks had been slight up to this point, but now their aircraft made a determined attempt to knock out the bridge. Intense concentrations of fire by 52nd and the other AA units broke up the attacks, destroyed six aircraft, and ensured that the bridge remained intact.Routledge, pp. 245‚Äì7. As XXXIII Corps launched its main drive from Kalewa in December, 52 HAA Rgt remained behind to defend the bridgehead area, later moving up to guard the line of communications as the Corps advanced towards Mandalay in January 1945. During the approach to Mandalay, the Corps HAA guns were frequently used as Corps medium artillery, bombarding enemy positions. Late in 1944, 52nd HAA Rgt had acquired a section of 7.2-inch howitzers to operate in this role, for which it had to find the detachments, command posts and observation post parties for this unfamiliar duty.Routledge, pp. 244, 247‚Äì8. The important airfield at Meiktila was captured by IV Corps on 20 February and turned into a defended 'box' against enemy counter-attacks, and 52nd HAA Rgt was transferred from XXXIII to IV Corps, with 271 Bty moving in to reinforce the box.Routledge, p. 248, Table XL, p. 255. As the British advance gained momentum, IV Corps' two divisions, 5th and 17th (Indian), began leap-frogging forwards. 155 and 271 Batteries of 52nd HAA Rgt accompanied 5th Division, while 159 Bty went with 17th Division. The HAA guns were mainly used in the ground role, but when the advance reached Payagyi and Pegu, only 70 miles from Rangoon, the airfield complex and the bridge over the Sittang River required AA cover, for which 271 Bty was deployed against small and scattered air raids. Routledge, p. 250. When Rangoon fell in early May, 24th AA Bde took over responsibility for its air defence, and 52nd HAA Rgt deployed its 24 3.7-inch guns to defend the docks, airfield and oil installations. It remained there when 24 AA Bde was replaced by 3 Indian AA Bde in June. The AA defence role at Rangoon ended in September 1945 and 52nd HAA Rgt was withdrawn. All the British regiments were on their way home by October.Routledge, pp. 250‚Äì1. The regiment's former 154 (London) HAA Battery had been converted into Medium Artillery (as part of 63 Medium Battery) in July 1944 and assigned to 87 Medium Regt. It remained in Burma when the rest of 87 Medium Regt returned to India, and on 17 August 1945 it rejoined 52 HAA Regt.Joslen, pp. 512, 519. It was apparently placed in suspended animation by 1946; the whole regiment with 155, 159 and 271 Btys followed it into suspended animation in the UK on 17 February 1946, completing the process by 10 March. ==Postwar== The regiment was reconstituted in the TA in 1947 as 452 (London) HAA Regiment at Acton in 67 AA Bde (the prewar 41 AA Bde). In 1954 it absorbed 454 (City of London) HAA Regiment, and the following year amalgamated with 453/488 (City of London) and 497 (Hammersmith) HAA Regiments in 33 AA Bde. The combined regiment retained the number 452, with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 1015.444‚Äì473 Regiments at British Army units from 1945 on * RHQ Battery ‚Äì from 453/488 HAA * P (Middlesex) Battery ‚Äì from 452 HAA * Q (Lloyds City of London Battery) ‚Äì from 454 HAA * R (Hammersmith) Battery ‚Äì from 497 HAA In 1961 the regiment amalgamated again with 264 (7th London) Field Regiment, 290 (City of London) Field Regiment and 353 (London) Medium Regiment to form 254 (City of London) Field Regiment, when the 52nd Anti-Aircraft lineage ended. ==Honorary Colonel== The motor manufacturer and philanthropist William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield was appointed Honorary Colonel of 52 (London) AA Regiment on 4 June 1937 and continued that role with 452 HAA Regiment.Burke's. ==NotesReferences== * Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 100th Edn, London, 1953. * Gen Sir Martin Farndale, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery: The Years of Defeat: Europe and North Africa, 1939‚Äì1941, Woolwich: Royal Artillery Institution, 1988/London: Brasseys, 1996, . * Gen Sir Martin Farndale, History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery: The Far East Theatre 1939‚Äì1946, London: Brasseys, 2002, . * J.B.M.

It was established as Reserve Patrol Squadron VP-905 in May 1946, redesignated Heavy Patrol Squadron (Landplane) VP-HL-51 on 15 November 1946, redesignated VP-731 in February 1950, redesignated VP-48 on 4 February 1953 and disestablished on 23 May 1991. It was the second squadron to be designated VP-48, the first VP-48 was disestablished on 31 December 1949. ==Operational history== P5M-1 is lifted by in San Diego Bay, c.1957 VP-48 SP5B at NAS San Diego, January 1967 VP-48 over San Francisco in 1970 *May 1946: VP-905 was established at NAS Grosse Ile, Michigan, with an official active duty home port at NAS San Diego, Calif. The squadron came under the operational control of FAW-14 and administrative control of the Naval Air Reserve Training Command (NARTC). The squadron was one of 21 reserve squadrons established after the war to accommodate the large number of aircrews recently released from active duty and utilize the enormous stocks of aircraft in the inventory. The squadron flew the PBY-5A Catalina seaplane and the PV-2 Harpoon. *15 November 1946: All patrol squadrons were redesignated. Regular Navy squadron designations began with 1 and reserve patrol squadron designations began with 5. VP-905 was redesignated VP-ML-55. The ML for reserve patrol squadrons included twin- engine medium amphibian seaplanes, as well as twin-engine land-based bombers. Regular Navy patrol squadron ML designations were for twin-engine medium landbased bombers only. Amphibian medium seaplanes like the PBY-5A were in the AM category. *February 1950: VP-ML-55 was redesignated VP-731 during the reorganization of Naval Aviation reserve units in 1949, but did not take effect until February 1950. During this period the number of Naval Aviation Reserve squadrons was reduced from the 1949 total of 24 to 9. By this date the squadron had transitioned to the PBM-5 Mariner. *29 September 1950: VP-731 was called to active duty due to the outbreak of the Korean War. The squadron reported for duty to Commander Naval Air Force Pacific Fleet at NAS San Diego, Calif. At the start of hostilities Navy patrol forces on active duty numbered just 20 squadrons and it quickly became apparent that this rather meager figure was inadequate to meet the increased demands. By the end of 1950 seven reserve patrol squadrons were called to active duty to augment the regular Navy patrol squadrons. *7 February 1951: VP-731 deployed to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, supported by . A detachment was maintained at Naval Station Sangley Point, Philippines, supported by . Both sections conducted patrols over the Formosa Strait and China coast. A single aircraft was detached to Hong Kong to provide courier service between Hong Kong and the Philippines. *29 May 1952: VP-731 began its second WestPac deployment based at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, supported by and . The squadron began combat operations over the Korean coastline on 1 June 1952. During the deployment the squadron alternated between Korea and the Formosa patrol area. *31 July 1952: A PBM-5S2 Mariner flown by Lieutenant E. E. Bartlett, Jr., was attacked by two Chinese MiG-15 fighters while on a reconnaissance patrol over the Yellow Sea off the west coast of Korea. Two crewmen were killed in the attack, tail gunner Aviation Machinist Mate H. G. Goodroad and Airman Claude Playforth. Two other crewmen were seriously wounded. Lieutenant Bartlett was able to escape the MiGs and land his heavily damaged Mariner at Baengnyeongdo, South Korea. Temporary repairs were made, enabling him to return to base at Iwakuni, Japan. *July 1953: VP-48 began its third WestPac deployment to Korea just as the hostilities ceased on 27 July 1953. The squadron was based at NAF Iwakuni, supported by USS Kenneth Whiting and USS Gardiners Bay. During a patrol on 30 July the port engine of a squadron PBM-5S2 caught fire causing the plane to crash. Only five of the 15 personnel on board survived and were picked up by a Coast Guard PBM. *June 1954: VP-48 transitioned from the PBM-5S2 Mariner to the P5M-1 Marlin seaplane. *3 May 1956: Two VP-48 Marlins en route from NAS North Island to Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, ditched due to low fuel state. One aircraft was taken under tow by a USCG vessel. The stood by until the tender arrived to retrieve the second aircraft. *22 October 1957: VP-48 deployed to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. While transiting via Hawaii, two aircraft were detached by Commander Fleet Air Hawaii for evaluation of an experimental seaplane fueling buoy. The two aircraft rejoined the squadron at Iwakuni on 2 November 1957. *19 March‚ÄìSeptember 1964: The squadron made its first deployment in over four years to WestPac, relieving VP-40 at NAS Sangley Point. In the last month of the deployment, on 2 August 1964, the Gulf of Tonkin Incident brought VP-48 into the South China Sea to support fleet operations. During these operations the squadron accumulated over 1,500 hours on patrol. *1 October 1965 ‚Äì September 1966: VP-48 deployed a six-aircraft detachment to NAS Sangley Point, rotating one relief crew and associated ground personnel to the detachment on a monthly basis. During the deployment the detachment conducted surveillance patrols over the South China Sea and Operation Market Time patrols over coastal Vietnam. While conducting these patrols the squadron was provided tender support at Cam Ranh Bay, South Vietnam, by USS Pine Island, and after February 1966, by . When operating from Buckner Bay, Okinawa, the squadron was supported by . The six aircraft that had been operated by the VP-48 detachment were transferred to VP-50 upon the conclusion of the deployment. *15 November 1966 ‚Äì April 1967: VP-48 transitioned to the P-3A Orion and a permanent change of station to NAS Moffett Field, Calif. Effective 15 February 1967, VP-48 was administratively assigned to FAW-10 vice FAW-14. The squadron received its first P-3A on 23 January 1967. The final detachment of squadron personnel was transferred from NAS North Island in April 1967. *24 July 1967 ‚Äì 31 January 1968: VP-48 deployed to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan, relieving VP-4. A two-aircraft detachment conducted operations from Guam and Midway islands. Additional detachments were maintained at NAS Sangley Point, in support of Vietnam combat missions. On 16 January 1968, a P-3A, BuNo. 152144, was lost and the entire crew killed in an accident. On 23 January 1968, the squadron commenced 24-hour ASW protection for Task Force en route from Pearl Harbor to the Sea of Japan. Crew 4 was assigned to ASW protection as part of Operation Formation Star. The task force had been brought into the area as a result of the Pueblo Incident. The squadron returned to NAS Moffett Field in February 1968 and began transitioning to the P-3B Orion. *1 December 1968: VP-48 deployed to Naval Air Facility Adak, Alaska. The squadron earned a Meritorious Unit Citation for its performance in tracking Soviet naval units during the deployment. *1 April 1970: VP-48 deployed to NAS Sangley Point, with a detachment at Cam Ranh Bay Air Base, Vietnam. The detachment was responsible for detecting eight enemy trawlers attempting to ship arms and munitions to the Viet Cong. VP-48‚Äôs performance during the deployment earned it a Meritorious Unit Commendation. *1 May 1971: VP-48 deployed to NAS Sangley Point, with a three-aircraft/four- crew detachment at U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield, Thailand. On 25 May, upon the closure of NAS Sangley Point, the squadron relocated to NAS Cubi Point, Philippines. *23 June‚ÄìDecember 1972: VP-48 began a three-way split deployment with one detachment of three aircraft/four crews at NS Adak, Alaska; a second detachment of three aircraft/four crews at Naval Air Station Agana, Guam; and the remaining three aircraft/ four crews at NAS Moffett Field, Calif. In December the Agana detachment tracked Russian missile instrumentation ships and watching two Soviet missiles impact in the Soviet Missile Range landing zone. *10 July 1978: VP-48 deployed to NAF Misawa, Japan. Shortly after arrival at Misawa, the squadron was forced to fly away in the face of Typhoon Virginia to NAS Cubi Point. *10 November 1979: VP-48 deployed to NAF Kadena, Japan, with a detachment at Diego Garcia. During the deployment the squadron played an important role in locating Vietnamese refugee boats for rescue units. The Diego Garcia detachment was on constant standby during the Iranian Revolution. *2 December 1985 ‚Äì May 1986: VP-48 deployed to NAS Adak, Alaska. On 7 May the 8.0 1986 Andreanof Islands earthquake struck while several squadron aircraft were airborne. The squadron executive officer communicated with the aircraft using a handheld transceiver until communications could be restored and the runways certified safe for landing. *July 1986: The squadron‚Äôs P-3C baseline Orions began block modification to the P-3C MOD version with new inertial navigation systems, secure HF radios and Harpoon missile capability. *15 June 1990: VP-48 deployed a three-aircraft and four- aircrew detachment to NAF Kadena. In Aug 1990, the detachment was relocated to NAS Cubi Point, in support of Operation Desert Storm. *23 May 1991: VP-48 was disestablished at NAS Moffett Field, Calif. ==Home port assignments== The squadron was assigned to these home ports, effective on the dates shown: *NAS Grosse Ile, Mich.

A large number of these monuments date back to the Byzantine and Ottoman periods. Since 1945, the Yugoslav authorities followed the idea of constructing a modern Pristina by relying in the urban development motto ‚Äúdestroy the old, build the new‚Äù and this resulted with major changes in the structure of the buildings, their function and their surrounding environment. However, numerous types of monuments have been preserved, including four mosques, a restored orthodox church, an Ottoman bath, a public fountain, a clock tower, several traditional houses as well as European-influenced architecture buildings such as the Museum of Kosovo. These symbolize the historical and cultural character of Pristina as it was developed throughout centuries in the spirit of conquering empires (Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian). == Overview of the history of Pristina == The city of Pristina has always been an area in flux with people coming and going. It has been inhabited for nearly 10.000 years. The early Neolithic findings dating from the 8th century BC were discovered in the areas surrounding Pristina such as: Matiqan, Gracanica and Ulpiana. In the Roman period, Pristina was part of the province of Dardania and nearby Ulpiana which was considered one of the most important Roman cities in the whole Balkans, became a Roman municipium in the 2nd century AD. The city was damaged by an earthquake in AD 518 and it was again rebuilt by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I who renamed it Iustiniana Secunda. By the arrival of Slavs in the 6th century, the city fell again in reconstruction. During the 14th and the 15th century, Pristina was classified as an important mining and trading center on the Balkan market due to its position near the rich mining town of Novo Brdo. Pristina was famous for its trade fairs and items, such as goatskin and goat hair, as well as gunpowder produced by artisans from Pristina in 1485. The first mosque in Pristina was built in the late 14th century, while under the Serbian rule. Pristina was considered to be an important town in Medieval Serbia by having been a royal estate of Stefan Milutin, Stefan Uro≈° III, Stefan Du≈°an, Stefan Uro≈° V and Vuk Brankoviƒá. In the early Ottoman era, Islam was spread increasingly throughout the population. In those years Pristina was part of the Vushtrri sancak and its 2.000 families enjoyed the peace and the stability of this era. During the 17th century, citizens of Pristina led by the Albanian priest Pjeter Bogdani vowed loyalty to the Austrian army and its troops. A communist decision to make Pristina the capital of Kosovo happened in 1947 during a period of a rapid development and structural despair. A famous slogan spread during this period was ‚Äúdestroy the old, build the new‚Äù. == List of monuments  Religious ===  Sultan Mehmet Fatih Mosque  Sultan Mehmet Fatih Mosque in the Ottoman quarter of Pristina, Kosovo The Sultan Mehmet Fatih Mosque, also known as the Imperial Mosque (), is located in the old quarter of Pristina opposite the clock tower. It was built in 1460‚Äì1461 during the reign of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II, also known as al-Fatih or the Conqueror and was named in his honor. Its interior features ornamental decorations and detailed floral designs, as well as a 15-meter dome, which was quite impressive for a 15th-century construction. It was recognized region-wide as the largest construction of this nature. In 1689, the mosque was temporarily converted into a Jesuit church dedicated to Francis Xavier by the Austrian occupants during the Austro-Turkish War. The Imperial Mosque was restored during the rule of Sultan Mehmet IV in 1682‚Äì1683, whereas the present-day minaret is a reconstruction of the original, which was damaged during the earthquake that struck Pristina in 1955. The mosque presently suffers from damage that has been caused over time; moisture is the biggest threat, harming the walls and stones of the construction.  Jashar Pasha Mosque  Jashar Pasha Mosque The Jashar Pasha Mosque, located in the historic centre of the city of Pristina, is a remarkable and notable part of Ottoman cultural heritage in this part of the Balkans. It was named after Jashar Mehmet Pasha, a wealthy citizen of Pristina and mayor of Skopje in 1842. Inscriptions found inside the mosque led to the conclusion that it was built in 1834. Jashar Pasha Mosque is a typical architectural monument for old cities with Ottoman heritage. It symbolizes a sacral building of ‚ÄòKosovar style‚Äô with an acknowledgement of oriental influence. Its aim was to speed up the acceptance of Islam among the citizens of Pristina. It is composed of a hall for prayers, hayat and a minaret. The mosque is disguised by a cupola supported by four pendentives. The original portico was torn down to give way to an expansion of the neighboring street. Currently, the building is in danger of being damaged as a result of humidity coming from the cracks in its walls. The particular characteristics of this monument and the attributes of the historical area where it is situated constitute the main components for the development of cultural tourism.  Carshi Mosque  thumb The Carshi Mosque, also known as the Bazaar Mosque and the Ta≈ü Mosque (literally, the Stone Mosque) (), is the oldest building in Pristina and it marks the beginning of the old town. The basement of this mosque was laid out in 1389 during the rule of the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I and its construction was continued during the reign of Sultan Murad II in the 15th century. The Carshi Mosque was built to celebrate the Ottoman victory of 1389 in the Battle of Kosovo. Over the years, the mosque has undergone through several restorations. However, its stone-topped minaret has survived for over six centuries (hence, it is often referred to as the Ta≈ü Mosque, or the Stone Mosque).  Pirinaz Mosque  Pirinaz Mosque Pirinaz Mosque was built in the second half of the 16th century and was founded by Piri Nazir who served as Vezir under two Ottoman Sultans. The Pirinaz Mosque is made of the same stone as Mbretit (Fatih) Mosque but its construction began 100 years later. This mosque represents an important cultural value, which is further increased by the belief that Prince Lazar's remains were buried on the location of today's Pirinaz Mosque with the permission of Sultan Bayezid, son and successor of Murat, who died in the battle of Kosovo in 1389. Later on, Lazar's remains were moved to Ravanici Monastery in Serbia. Furthermore, the local legend has it that ‚ÄúStone of Lazar‚Äù located in the garden of Pirinaz Mosque was used to behead Prince Lazar. However, the real circumstances encompassing Lazar's death, remain unknown. Saint Nicholas Orthodox Church  Saint Nicholas Church  The Saint Nicholas Church is the only remaining operative Serbian Orthodox Church in Pristina. It is housed in a 19th-century building, which was damaged during the 2004 unrest in Kosovo and was restored thereafter with European Union funding. It used to showcase 18th century wooden icons, created by painters based in Debar, Macedonia, several 18th century frescos and an iconostasis of 1840 from Belgrade, Serbia, which were all irreversibly damaged during the 2004 unrest. The Saint Nicholas Church once again began to hold liturgies in 2010 in a ceremony attended by a few hundred Serbian Orthodox believers. It now features a revamped exterior, restored roof, new marble tiles and new icons. === Baths and Fountains ===  Great Hammam  Pristina and the great Hammam The Great Hammam dates back to the 15th century. It used to be part of the complex of the Sultan Murat Fatih Mosque and according to the legend, the construction workers who were hired to build Fatih Mosque were ordered by Sultan Mehmet II to take daily baths in the hammam. It had two symmetrical baths, one for women and the other one for men. The hammam is composed of 15 domes with small holes which are used to let the light penetrate in. A fire that occurred in 1994, resulted with an illegal opening of three shops which blocked the old entrance. Unfortunately, a hammam that once used to be a prestigious social venue for men and women, for many years looked abandoned with only few remaining walls full of rubbish, overgrown trees and wastewaters flowing inside of the building. However, the complex underwent through a restoration process.  Shad√´rvan  Shad√´rvan in the Ottoman quarter of Pristina, Kosovo Shad√´rvan is a marble fountain located between the Carshi Mosque and the Museum of Kosovo and is a typical component of Ottoman architecture. The fountain is the only one remaining in the city from over fifty that once existed. In addition to providing a source of drinkable water, Shad√´rvan has been traditionally used for ritual ablution. === Cultural houses ===  Museum of Kosovo  National Museum of Kosovo The Kosovo Museum was once the seat of the vilayet of Kosovo, while now is housed in an Austro-Hungarian architecture yellow building. It was built by the Austrian occupants for the Turkish Army in 1898. From the 1950s and onwards, it underwent through different changes and served different purposes prior to becoming a museum. In this context, from 1945 to 1975 it served as the base of the Yugoslav National Army. In 1963, it was sold to the Museum of Kosovo and from 1995 to 2002, it was used as the main office for the European Agency for Reconstruction. The museum is full of rich collections of the prehistoric era. One of the most prominent piece is a small (no more than 30 cm tall) statue called ‚ÄúThe Goddess on Throne‚Äù. The object is believed to be 6000 years old and was found in a site called ‚ÄúTjerrtorja‚Äùnear Pristina. in 1956 Just before the onset of the Kosovo War in 1998, the statue was unwillingly taken to Belgrade along with 1,247 other artefacts. In May 2002, by the intervention of the UN, the ‚ÄúGoddess on Throne‚Äù was returned to Pristina.  Emin Gjiku complex  Ethnological Museum \\"Emin Gjiku\\" Set in the old quarter of Pristina, the Ethnological Museum ‚ÄúEmin Gjiku‚Äù is a typical example of the Ottoman influence in the city and is included in the cultural heritage of the city. The complex features several buildings which now showcase exhibitions of various cultural artifacts. The complex once belonged to Emin Gjinolli (Turkish Emin K√ºc√ºk); literally, ‚Äòlittle Emin‚Äô - who was a member of one of the most recognized families of Pristina in the 20th century. It has been protected by law since 1957, while it was only turned into an ethnological museum in 2006 after undergoing through a restoration process. The Ethnological Museum ‚ÄúEmin Gjiku‚Äù is composed of a traditional guest house, an arts studio, a family home and a permanent ethnological exhibition. The latter one showcases clothing items and artifacts related to birth, wedding and funeral ceremonies.  Kosovo Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Monuments  Kosovo Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Monuments, also known as Kocadishi House is an Ottoman merchant's home that features a veranda on the first floor and high walls for business and family purposes, which belonged to the Kocadishi family in 1954. The family migrated to Turkey as a result of a special treaty between Yugoslavia and Turkey in 1953. The house, which has survived and is close to the city's old clock tower, is now being used by the Kosovo Institute for the Protection of Monuments.  \\"Hivzi Sylejmani\\" library  The exact year of the establishment of the \\"Hivzi Sylejmani\\" library is not confirmed; it is believed to have begun its work in February 1945. At the time of the inauguration, approximately 1,300 books were available in the Serbian and Albanian language. The library has been in its present location only since 1947, whereas the building itself was built in 1930. The building is also notable because of the fact that Miladin Popoviƒá, the former leader of Kosovo's Regional Committee who was murdered in 1945, was accommodated in this house. \\"Hivzi Sylejmani\\" library was officially and legally established in April 1963 by the Municipal Assembly of Pristina. Its name changed several times: at some point, it was referred to as the ‚ÄúPeople's Library‚Äù; then, as the \\"Public Library Miladin Popoviƒá\\"; later as the \\"City Library\\" and so on. During the 1990s, this library faced many difficulties, especially political ones during the time when Dragolub Petroviƒá acted as the head of the Library. Before 1992, there were approximately 130,611 available books, whilst in 1999 the number decreased to 62,274, of which 38,153 were in Serbian, 19,726 in Albanian, 3,274 in Turkish and 1,121 in other foreign languages. After the end of the Kosovo War, the Library started to recover which also resulted with the opening of its chain all over Kosovo. Hynyler House  The Hynyler House  The Hynyler House symbolizes a typical Ottoman konak. It is a private house, which has been under the list of the protected monuments since 1967 and the family living there have been trying to take their house off this list. Clock Tower-Sahat Kulla === Others ===  Clock Tower  The Clock Tower was built in the 19th century by Jashar Pasha. It served as a means of informing the town during the Ottoman Empire rule, in order to let people know when to pray as well as the traders closing their shops. The 26-meter high hexagonal clock tower was made of sandstone and bricks. The original tower was burned in fire and its bricks were used for reconstruction. The authentic bell was brought from Moldova and had the inscription ‚ÄúThis bell was produced in 1764 for Jon Moldova Rumenin‚Äù However, the circumstances of how the bell was brought to Pristina are not clearly known; its theft in 2001 is even more unclear The same year, French KFOR troops assisted in installing a new clock by changing the old clock mechanism with an electric one. Jewish cemetery  Jewish cemetery  The Jewish cemetery, which dates back to the 19th century, is a burial site in the outskirts of Pristina consisting of 57 tombstones. The city was once home to a Jewish community numbering over 1,500 people, who settled in the Balkans during the late 15th century from Spain after escaping the Reconquista. Up until 2011, the cemetery was in a devastating condition due to neglect; it was then restored by a team of international and Kosovan university students, but it was afterwards vandalized by unknown subjects. This attack was condemned by several local and international institutions.  Tjerrtorja  Tjerrtorja was a neolithic settlement which was identified accidentally in the 1950s somewhere around the outskirts of Pristina. The neolithic site was named after the discovery place, where a factory was started to be built known as the cotton and textile production plant Tjerrtorja. The area was believed to have had an abundant collection of terracotta figurines, human shaped statues and baked clay anthropomorphic artifacts. One of the most impressive terracotta figurines which has been discovered after some continuous excavation within this area was called ‚ÄúThe Goddess on Throne‚Äù. Mausoleum of Sultan Murat I  Mausoleum of Sultan Murat I  The Mausoleum of Sultan Murat I, also known as Bajraktari T√ºrbe, is a religious object built in honour of Sultan Murat I, who was killed in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. The building constructed in 1850, does not actually contain the remains of Sultan Murat since they have been moved to the imperial museum in Bursa, Turkey. It is currently in a bad state since it was heavily damaged during the Kosovo War. In addition to a garden, there is little to see inside of the building; an important feature of the garden is a 700‚Äëyear‚Äëold mulberry tree which survived from the war. A small group of people from Pristina who follow the Sadije Dervish order, of which Sultan Murat's standard- bearer is believed to have been a member, try to look after and to keep the building protected from the further decay. == Transformed monuments  Former Hotel Union building === The restored Hotel Union The building of the former ‚ÄúHotel Union‚Äù was built in 1927 under the supervision of the Austrian architect, Andrija Kremer. It combined elements of neo-Renaissance, neo-baroque and Art Nouveau and was one of the few buildings in Pristina with European-architecture influence. During the first few decades of its existence, it was named ‚ÄúHotel Sk√´nderbeu‚Äù after the 15th century Albanian resistance leader, Skanderbeg and this was witnessed by his ingrained icons on the building. After World War II, the building was nationalized by the government and was renamed as ‚ÄúHotel Union‚Äù. The discussions for the future of the building sparked in 2008 when the Municipality of Pristina announced its intentions of flattening the building of the former ‚ÄúHotel Union‚Äù, under the pretense that it did not possess any noteworthy architectural value and that it should make way for the new boulevard ‚ÄúIbrahim Rugova‚Äù that was to be built. This was confirmed by some experts who assessed that about 80% of the historical values had been irreversibly damaged. This was met with objections by groups who advocated for its restoration to its original state. Also, the Institute for the Protection of Monuments of Kosovo voiced its recommendation for the immediate restoration on a publication. The condition of the building was further worsened when it was set on fire in 2009. A homeless man was shortly after arrested under the suspicion of committing this crime. The confusion appeared to be finally solved in 2010, when the Council of Kosovo for Cultural Heritage announced its agreement with the Italian fashion retailer The United Colors of Benetton to restore the building to a near-original state. After the restoration works were completed in 2013, The United Colors of Benetton inaugurated a 2,000 square meters store in the premises of the renovated building of former ‚ÄúHotel Union‚Äù. === Monuments no longer existing ===  Old Hammam  The Old Hammam belongs to those cultural monuments that have been collapsed throughout times but are still remembered as objects with tremendous impacts in a country's historical culture. According to some sources, the hammam was built in the 15th century around the same time as the Great Hammam. Currently, there is nothing left from it and even its ruins that were discovered closed to today's government building, have been covered rapidly by former town planners.  Carshi  The old bazaar belongs to the old unsustainable structures which were demolished during war conflicts. The bazaar, which was ravaged in 1953, was situated in the heart of the old city of Pristina. It had more than 300 shops as well as other objects such as: the mosque, the main Christian church, the old Ottoman hammam, a synagogue and a huge number of houses belonging to the old Ottoman architecture. == Current state  Restoration === Several of the historical monuments in Pristina have undergone through an irregular restoration process, whose aim was to preserve the cultural and historical heritage of the city. Among these, the Sultan Mehmet Fatih Mosque, the Carshi Mosque, the Saint Nicholas Church, the clock tower, the Jewish cemetery all underwent through separate processes of renovation and revitalization throughout their years of existence. The restoration was conducted throughout different periods and by different institutions or individuals. In this regard, the Sultan Mehmet Fatih Mosque was restored by Sultan Mehmet IV in the late 17th century, the Saint Nicholas Church with financial means of the European Union and the Jewish cemetery by university students. In addition, the renovation of the Carshi Mosque was conducted by the Municipality of Pristina and its investment reached figures as high as half a million euros. === Great Hammam === The process of the restoration of the Great Hammam initially began in 2007 and was initiated by the Municipality of Pristina and the Cultural Heritage without Borders office in Kosovo. The total investment made in the restoration process is estimated to have been in the region of 700 thousand euros and this was divided into three phases. These consisted of investigation and assessment, structural restoration and attempts for re-functioning. The Great Hammam was inaugurated in October 2013, despite the fact that restoration was still undergoing at that time. There were attempts to open a museum showcasing neolithic artifacts from Pristina and the region and an arts gallery inside the hammam. However, the restoration process was met with controversy by some officials and governmental institutions of Kosovo. In this sense, the Ministry of Culture of Kosovo put a halt to the renovation process in February 2013 due to their questioning of the construction material used. The works were restarted in May 2013 after a commission recommended that the material be replaced with a mixture that was closer to the authentic one. Moreover, officials of the Kosovo Council for Cultural Heritage criticized the restoration by noting that the renovations during the period of 2009‚Äì2013 had damaged the monument. Gjejlane Hoxha, the executive director of this institution stated that the monument was in an improper situation and that its integrity and authenticity were threatened by the aftermaths of the uncontrolled activities of the restoration process and its conversion into a museum of Pristina. Moreover, she stated that if no specific action was to be undertaken to improve the image of this object, she would direct her concern to the Prosecution of Kosovo. She channeled her concern to the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports of Kosovo through a written statement, in which she expressed her unsettlement for the conservation process. Furthermore, the entire restoration process was delayed several times; the entire process took over six years to be completed. == Legislation == The boundaries of the old town of Pristina were judicially regulated by the Detailed Urban Plan in 1978 by the Institute of Urban Planning of the Municipality of Pristina. This covered an area of 8,2 ha and according to it, this was the only area in the city which consisted of culturally significant buildings and landmarks. However, the area suffered from illegal constructions that sprang up after the period of the conflict in Kosovo and in order to address this issue, the authorities for urban planning of Pristina approved a strategic plan in 2004. Relying on the Law for Spatial Planning (no. 2003/4) and the Regulation on the Self-Governance of Kosovo Municipalities (no. 2000/45), in 2006 the Municipal Assembly of Pristina initiated a regulatory plan which defined boundaries that comprised an area of 26 ha. This was amended in 2009 by further adding new zones which came up to 42 ha. Moreover, the regulatory plan is expected to be further expanded and improved, as witnessed on the 2012 strategic plan of the Municipality of Pristina. On the other hand, individual monuments have been protected by law with various decisions and regulations, which were mostly approved in the 1950s and 1960s. The following table indicates the year of the adaptation of judicial means to preserve some of the historical monuments of Pristina: {  - ! Name of the monument !! Year of approval of the respective protection law -  Sultan Mehmet Fatih Mosque  1953 -  Pirinaz Mosque 1967 -  Carshi Mosque  1967 -  Jashar Pasha Mosque  1967 -  Iconostasis of Saint Nicholas Church and two houses of the Archbishop 1956 and 1961, respectively -  Clock tower  1967 -  Shad√´rvani  1967 -  Jewish cemetery  1967 -  Remains of the foundation of the old hammam  1959 -  Great Hammam  1985 -  Tjerrtorja  1955 -  Museum of Kosovo  1967 -  Kosovo Institute for the Preservation of Cultural Monuments (Kocandishi house)  1957 -  Emin Gjiku Complex  1955 -  ‚ÄúHivzi Sylejmani‚Äù library  1967 -  Former ‚ÄúHotel Union‚Äù building  1996 } == See also == *Monuments of Kosovo *Cultural heritage of Kosovo *Ottoman architecture == References  Bibliography == *Warrander, Gail, and Verena Knaus.

He later joined Pierre Chouteau, Jr. in a fur trapping and trading business. He extended his interests into other areas of commerce and became very wealthy. In the final years of his life he was involved with the landmark court case of Dred Scott v. Sandford [sic], which is perhaps what he is best known for today. He suffered mental illness and died in an asylum. ==Biography== Sanford's parents were Francis Alexander Sanford (c. 1782-1848) and Mary Adams.John Sanford Barnes, in his autobiography, indicates that his grandmother's name was Charlotte Adam, not Mary His step mother, from his father's later marriage, was also named Mary. Before about 1810 they lived in Westmoreland County, Virginia and after this date up to 1829 their home was in Winchester, Virginia.John F. A. Sanford and his sister Charlotte (b.1808) were born in Westmoreland. Henrietta (b.1811) and the later siblings were born in Winchester. In her biography of Sanford, Janet Lecompte, says she failed to turn up records of the family in Winchester before 1810. John F. A. Sanford, the eldest child of seven, attended the academy at West Point, and in 1825 became a clerk and interpreter in the St Louis office of Indian Affairs under William Clark. In 1826 he was appointed as a sub-agent in the remote Mandan villages of the upper Missouri. He replaced the former agent, 29-year-old Peter Wilson, who had died earlier that year after being taken ill in a Mandan settlement. For a period of about seven years Sanford worked with several tribes including Minitarees, Crows, Arikaras, Assiniboines, Knisteneaux and Yanctonais Sioux, estimating that the population in his area was in the order of 75,000. Sanford tried to resolve underfunding issues and made requests for better pay and for an improvement in his situation. These were ignored and to further add to his frustration, he was criticised in the House of Representatives for the expenses incurred when he took a delegation of tribesmen to Washington. This both damaged his career prospects, and came as a personal blow. In 1832 Sanford struck up a friendship with Pierre Chouteau Jr., a member of the wealthy St Louis fur trading family, and was offered a position in Chouteau's business. He joined in 1833, later becoming a partner and then the company‚Äôs representative in Washington and New York. Sanford also married Chouteau‚Äôs daughter, Emilie, although she died in 1836. Their only child, Benjamin, was raised by the Chouteau family. At this time Sanford purchased a farm in St Louis for his father, who lived there until his death in 1848. Sanford became wealthy; his business interests included mining, railroads and mercantile. In 1851 he became one of the founder members of a company that was formed to build the Illinois Central Railroad. In 1850 he married Isabel Davis, daughter of Thomas E. Davis, New York real estate developer. Sanford with his father-in-law Davis, and brother-in-law, Frederick C. Gebhard, invested in various joint ventures including the St Anthony Falls Water Power Company, Allentown Railroad Company and the Dauphin and Susquehanna Coal Company. In 1853 Sanford became involved with a landmark court case: Dred Scott, a slave working for Sanford's brother-in-law, had been seeking his freedom through the courts since 1846. In 1853 Scott's case went to the Supreme Court with Sanford named as the defendant; the Court ruled in Sanford's favor. Sanford suffered mental illness during 1857 and was admitted to an asylum. At one point he was thought to be recovering, but had a relapse and died on 6 May 1857 in Manhattan. ==Family== In about 1829 Sanford's father moved his family to Fort McHenry, Maryland, to take up the post of an army sutler. As a consequence, 4 of Sanford's sisters met and married military men: Charlotte married General James Barnes, Henrietta married Major John B. Clark, Mary married Colonel Henry Bainbridge and Irene married army surgeon Dr John Emerson. The 5th sister, Virginia, who was the youngest, married stove manufacturer Samuel H. Ransom of Albany. Sanford‚Äôs brother, naval captain Joseph P. Sanford, married Ransom's sister Lydia, and between tours of service, worked for stove manufacturer Rathbone in Albany.Joseph's father Alexander had also been involved with a foundry business during his time in Winchester Sanford's second wife, Isabel, moved to Paris, France in the 1860s with the 2 children from their marriage - Emilie and John Francis. Emilie, married French diplomat Count Maurice Sala. Their son, Count Antoine Sala, married Laura Bache Kayser, daughter of Julius Kayser, silk glove and hosiery manufacturer. By coincidence, Isabel's uncle, Rev. John Power, Vicar General of New York, had baptized Sanford's son, Benjamin Chouteau Sanford, many years previously in New York, on 12 February 1837. The sponsors were Robert Anderson, Charles Chouteau, Julia Chouteau and Mary Bainbridge.Early U.S. French Catholic Church Records (Drouin Collection), 1695-1954 for Benjamin Chouteau Sanford ==NotesReferences * Category:1806 births Category:1857 deaths Category:People from St. Louis Category:People of Dakota Territory Category:American merchants Category:American slave owners Category:Deaths in mental institutions ","title":"John F.

The main reason for Pristina's air pollution is coal mining and energy emitted by the single producer of energy, Kosovo Energy Corporation J.S.C. KEK operates through two power plants, Kosovo A and B located 5 km near Pristina. Furthermore, the diesel- based car traffic highly contributes to the pollution of air, along with the wood and coal household heating system and central coal-heating company \\"Termokos\\" that operates in Pristina. ==Air pollution in Pristina== The main sources of air pollution in Pristina are: *Traffic ‚Äì cars and busses in Pristina *\\"Termokos\\" heating company *Kosova A and B located near Pristina Air in Pristina is polluted mainly from: *Particulate Matter ‚Äì PM10, PM2.5 (Dust) *Gases ‚Äì NO2, SO2, CO, O3 ===Sources of air pollution=== Gases NO The main nitrogen oxide found in the air in Pristina is nitrogen oxide NO2. NO affects the color of textile materials, causes corrosion in metallic materials, and at vegetation causes the drop of leaves; therefore, limit values are set. NO2 is 4 times more lethal than NO, and it is mostly concentrated in urban areas. NO2 in Pristina comes 52% from transport, 28% from fuel for power production, and 11% from industry. Pristina has a lower annual average of NO2 emission as compared to the annual average limit allowed. {  - !Nitrogen dioxide (NO)-annual average for 2010 and 2011 -   2010  2011 -  Annual average value limit for protection of materials  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 40 ¬µg/m3 -  Pristina-KHMI  20.82  - } Annual average of NO in Pristina The annual average of NO emission in Pristina was 20.82 ¬µg/m3 in 2010, which is lower than limit of 40 ¬µg/m3. There are no available data for 2011, which would allow in turn comparing 2010 and 2011. However, this result comes from very low percentage of data collected, with only 68% of data being valid; this means that the emission of NO, may not be accurate. In the other hand, according to the National Institute of Public Health of Kosovo study, the emission of NO2 is alarming; in only three months of, NO2 measurement has exceeded allowed emissions by 18 times. The emission of NO is higher in winter, where the heating process is accelerated, with February being as the peak month. The main contributor to the pollution of air with NO is Kosovo A and B power plants. Thus, NO emission is estimated to be higher in urban areas where traffic is enormous. The good side of the story is that in Pristina there is no exceed of the NO limit that would cause health problems in people's life; however, this does not apply for other cities of Pristina.

CO Prishtina n√´ per√´ndim t√´ diellit Vehicles and fuel burning companies are the main CO pollutants of air in Pristina. Fuel burning contains liquid fuels, natural gas and wood, combustion of coal, and industrial processes such as furnaces, paper factories, the refineries, and facilities for production of construction materials. CO emission in air can be mitigated through plants; however, this is another problem in Pristina. The lack of green spaces and well-maintained parks makes impossible the mitigation of CO. The highest pollutant is the production of energy, with its annual CO contribution to global warming is 5.5 million tons. CO pollution comes 30% from fuel use for power generation, 29% from transport, 20% from industry, 15% from residential commerce, and 6% from other sources. If Pristina is compared with regional countries, it is noticed that Pristina exceeds the OSCE and EU emissions of CO. Pristina has higher emission of CO2 compared to the region of Serbia, and lower emissions compared to the region of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Particulate matter (dust) PM emission on air comes mainly from transport in Pristina. In road transportation, this comes mainly from cars and tires. The problem relies in the intensive increase of automobiles in Pristina, where most of them are old and do not possess catalysts. Pristina's cars life span differs from 5 years to more than 15 years. 7.5% of registered cars are newer than 5 years old, 77.36% are older than 10 years, and 66.82% of them are more than 15 years old. Furthermore, each day in Pristina enter an enormous number of cars, creating traffic as well as air pollution. Out of the total number of vehicles registered in Kosovo, 31.18% of them are registered in Pristina; 84% are passenger's vehicles, 13% are from transporting, and the others come mainly from urban traffic. The public transportation in Pristina contains mainly busses exported from other countries. There are 757 licensed buses routes per day and out of these 382 are executed on average per day. Buses/minibuses connecting urban and suburban areas total 151with 935 departures per day. There are two main stations in Pristina that measure the air pollution: Kosovo Hydro Meteorological Institute and \\"Rilindja.\\" PM {  - !PM number of days with exceeded daily limit value for 2010 and 2011 !! 2010 !! 2011 -  Daily limit value  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 50 ¬µg/m3 -  Number of days with exceedances within a year  colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" 35days -  Pristina-IHMK  99  68* -  Pristina-ex-Rilindja  69*  92* } Number of days with exceeded limit values of PM As it can be seen from the table that the maximum amount allowed to be exceeded with PM10, is 35 days and the maximum daily value is 50 ¬µg/m3. However, according to KHMI, Pristina has exceeded this limit for 99 days in 2010 and for 68 days in 2011. The majority of days with exceedance of average daily values were during the winter months. The table below presents PM maximum, minimum, and average monthly values, where November is the month with the highest recorded PM value. {  - ! PM !! Average !! Max !!

It is the primary factor contributing to the pollution of air with the above-mentioned gasses. Kosovo A and B power plant produce 97% of the energy used in Pristina, while only 3% comes from water. Kosovo Energy Corporation is the main polluter in Pristina region. There is no continuous emission monitoring system from those two plants. However, lower emissions have been reported in Kosovo B compared to Kosovo A. Kosovo A has three blocks, A, A, A, and Kosovo B has two blocks B and B. According to the state report for environmental conditions in Kosovo, both power plants have exceeded the SO limit in air, that of 400 mg/Nm3, and the NO limit that of 500 mg/Nm3, and dust emission limit that of 50 mg/Nm3. CO emission from A is lower from power plant B, as it can be seen in the table below. {  - ! !! 2007 !! 2008 !! 2009 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 -  TC A 2087938  2008196  2364253  2848117 2893087  2762053 -  TC B  3636361 4338011  4689615  4249301  3463901  3314555 -  TCA+ TCB  5724299 6346207  7053868 7097418  6356988  6076608 } CO emissions from power plant A and B in Pristina Electro filters are planned to be established in A, A and A with the aim to increase the efficiency of the existing electro filters. However, as it can be seen, KEDS CO emissions are more than 6 million tons annually, which means 520 tons per hour. When KEDS produces at full capacity (200 MW), it emits 25 tons of dust and ash (that includes gases) per hour, which is 74 times more than the European limit. Critical months are April, June, July, October, November and December, where the emission of gases and dust exceeds the limit allowed. Facts from Ministry of Environment and Spatial Planning in Kosovo: \\"Greenhouse gasses: 10,797,000 tons of CO and 425,000 t of CH\\" \\"CO emissions: 986,000 tons\\" \\"Dust emissions: 167,000 t with specific values from 1,881mg/m to 7,523 mg/m at Kosovo A and 250 mg/m at Kosovo B\\" \\"SO emissions: 167,000 t with specific values of 895 mg/m\\" \\"NO Emission: 20,000 t with specific values from 358 mg/m to 478 mg/m at Kosovo A and 735 mg/m at Kosovo B.\\" The Ministry of Environment has concluded that the problem with dust emitted from those two power plants is serious and it cannot be avoided without major redesign of the boilers. Units in Kosovo A need serious assessment since they are at the end of their lifespan. On the other hand, Kosovo B has a longer lifespan, but the existing electrostatic precipitator is in very bad conditions and also there is low control of dust emission in the air. European Union has set some targets that those power plants reach by 2017. Dust emission should be max 50 mg/Nm, SO max 400 mg/Nm, and NO max 500 mg/Nm. {  - ! Pollutant !! TCA !! TCB !!

This company operates with oil and gas, while the cogeneration system is considered to be a very stable solution for the improvement of the heating system in Pristina. However, Termokoscovers only three main cities in Kosovo, 3‚Äì4% of households, in general, are heated from it. There are some problems related with Termokos: * Loss of water/energy during distribution * No coverage of entire city with central heating * No use of energy alternatives such as solar heating * Pollutants emitted in the air {  - ! Pollutant !! Termokosi !! Limit -  SO  491.0  400 mg/Nm } SO pollution from Termokos As it can be seen in the table Termokos releases 491 mg/Nm, while the limit, as stated before is 400 mg/Nm. In this way, it can be noticed that Termokos is one of the main pollutants of Pristina. Households in Pristina use mainly wood for heating. Oftentimes, households use old sofa that do not use filters, and the pollutants end up in the air. This problem could be avoided if the central heating problem would be solved, so that Termokos could supply with heating each house in Pristina region. This in turn would disincentivize people to secure heating materials on their own, which in turn would decrease the air pollution as well. ===Laws on air pollution=== For more information visit: Kosovo Law on Air Protection For more information visit:\\"\\" Kosovo Law on Environment Protection ==Water contamination== Pristina City has limited quantities of surface and groundwater, which are mainly distributed in the peripheral areas. A small fraction of the available water is found as underground water, such as that in \\"Pajtimi\\" field that amounts to 50 litres/sec and \\"Germia\\" source that amounts to 15 litres/sec. Watercourses are scarce. There are small rivers in the urban area, such as Pristina and Vellusha Rivers that collect the water flows of faux pas coming from Lagjia e Spitalit, Mati, Kodra e Trimave, and Shkabaj. Vellusha and Pristina Rivers serve to collect rainwater from all urban areas of Pristina. The main drinking water sources remain Batllava and Badovc Lakes. Batllava Lake ‚Äì it has a capacity of 38 million m3 of water and supplies the town of Pristina with 65% of drinking water. Batllava represents the main source of drinking water for the municipality of Pristina. It was built in 1960-1963; initially it worked only for technical water supply to the energy complex in Obilic. From 1982 it turned into water resource for drinking water for the Pristina region. Recently, the water treatment plant in Shajkovc was built, which has a maximum capacity of 900 liters/sec. Badovci Lake- has a volume of 27 million m3 and supplies the town of Pristina with 35% of drinking water. It was initially built in 1960 for the supply of drinking water, irrigation, and technical water for Kishnica mine. From 1980 this lake is mainly used for drinking water purposes for Pristina region. The water treatment plant has been built in Badovc, which has a maximum capacity 400l/sec. Those two lakes are the main source of water in Pristine. They both supply around 90% of population in Pristina region with drinking water. However, the distribution power has many problems. Most of the pipes used are older than 50 years, which lose around 50% of available water; 35% are technical losses, while 15% are commercial losses. As a result there are reductions on available water to citizens, with 8-10 hours/day water cuts to each household. Another problem is the water contamination. There is no urban water monitoring in Kosovo. There are only some small regional, water companies that do not have large competencies on water monitoring. Wastewater discharges remain the main pollutants of water in Pristina. Those wastes are dangerous because they contain substances such as soluble compounds of phosphorus, dissolved oxygen, pathogenic bacteria and viruses, nitrogen (eutrophication), and other matters that affect the water quality. Main carrier of underground waters pollution is Prishtevka River, which at the same time is the main carrier of sewage and rainwater. ===Waste in water=== There are two main pollutants of water in Pristina: collective pollutants and industrial pollutants. Collective pollutants are households and individuals that throw waste in water and have common canalization system. Industrial pollutants are the largest industrial pollutants, such as agriculture, chemicals, and ironmongery pollutants. There are six individual pollutants in Prishtevka River, and one collective pollutant. There are 15 collective pollutants in Llapi River, and seven individual pollutants. Sitnica River has 24 collective pollutants and seven individual pollutants, and Gracanka River has three collective pollutants, and one individual pollutant. The table below shows the individual pollutants in Pristina and their landfills. { border=\\"1\\"  +  Municipality  Pollutant Name  Action  Dump site -  rowspan=\\"7\\"  Pristina  \\"Auto Parkingu\\"  Autopark-Ironmongery  Prishtevke -  \\"Erona Riciklim\\"  Ironmongery  Prishtevke -  \\"Idea\\"  Food Industry  Prishtevke -  \\"Kosova Tex\\"  Textile Industry  Prishtevke -  \\"Kualiteti\\"  Slaughterhouse  Prishtevke -  \\"trafiku Urban\\"  Autopark-Oficine  Underground water -  \\"NTP Vjosa\\"  Food Industry  Prishtevke } Individual Water Pollutants in Pristina ===Sewage waters=== The city of Pristina has the system of moving sewage water out of the center of Pristina, but it does not have the system of continuing maintenance of sewage waters. The movement of sewage waters is done toward rivers in Pristina, mainly on Sitnica River. Sitnica is the main receiver of sewage waters coming from citizens of Pristina. The total amount of water discharged into Sitnica from the urban area is 800 litres/sec, from which 450liter/sec are taken through Pristina River and 150 litres/sec through Vellushariver. Other amounts are taken through Shkabajfaux pas. There are only 8 settlements in Pristina with public or own canalization system. The table below presents main regions of Pristina and their landfills of sewage waters. { border=\\"1\\"  +  Municipality  Pollutant Name  Action  Dump site -  rowspan=\\"10\\"  Pristina  \\"Qyteti\\"  430245  Prishtevke -  \\"Bardhosh\\"  2150  Lumi Llap -  \\"Barileve\\"  4200  Lumi Llap -  \\"Besi\\"  907  Lumi Llap -  \\"Hajvali\\"  6000  Gracanke -  \\"Prroni i njelmet\\"  1000  Underground water -  \\"Prugovc-Leban\\"  800  Lumi Llap -  \\"Shkabaj\\"  1500  Sitnice -  \\"Trude\\"  540  Lumi Llap -  \\"Vranidoll\\"  870  Lumi Llap } Water pollutants in Pristina As it can be seen from the table, the main polluted river with most sewage waters flows on it is Prishtevka. It can be said that Prishtevka has turned into a river flow of sewage waters, with more than 400,000 inhabitants polluting it. Another big problem is with sewage waters that are present in Taukbash√ße Park, which besides the fact that they are polluted and are part of the park, they also smell horrible for people who visit the park. This may cause health problem to people, given the fact that elderly people are those that visit this park mostly. ===Underground waters=== Considering the problem of Pristina to supply its citizens with water, underground water has been thought to be a rescue for this problem. Kolevica underground waters have been the main supplier of water for Pristina from 1950 to 1970. Those waters are placed in the northern side of Pristina, with a maximum capacity of 50 litres/sec. However, with the construction of Batllava River, those underground rivers were left unused, and now they form part of the polluted waters in Pristina. Germia Source is another underground water resource that lies in Germia Park ad is the oldest water sources known. It has been used many years ago, and it has a flow of 15 litres/sec. This source is used for GermiaBasis, while those days Germia‚Äôs underground waters are considered to be the main source of water for Pristina citizens. ===Wells in Pristina=== There are hidden wells in Pristina, which most of them are covered with waste and are in the most polluted areas of Pristina. These sources are used when surface water is lacking. Recently, water has been found in \\"Pajtimi\\" field, which currently is one of the waste polluted areas. However, in an attempt to clean Pristina environment, and also find water, the opening phase of these wells has started and they are estimated to be completed by mid-2014. In this place, 9 wells are found, and the flow is estimated at 60 litres/sec. There are two other wells in Llukar village. Those wells are estimated to have a flow of 50 litres/sec. The problem with those two wells is their usage, mainly for auto washing. Those wells ceased being used in 1989, and they are expected to become active again by mid-2014. A plan to plant trees in Pristina and lower air pollution has prompted that 17 artificial wells to be opened in Pristina. The Pristina municipal government has provided funding for these wells, which would supply the water the irrigation of the newly planted trees. ===Law on water protection=== For more information visit: Kosovo Law on Water ==Waste== The region of Pristina is the highest waste container. In 2007, 61.644.35 ton of waste have been collected only in Pristina, while in 2008, 80.185.06 tons of waste has been collected in Pristina. {  - ! No !! Sanitarian Disposal !! Jan !! Feb !! Mar !!

If Pristina is compared with other municipalities, it can be seen that Pristina differs much more. While in Pristina the average waste disposal is 332 kg/year per person, in other municipalities this average is 95 kg/year per person. The problem relies in the disposal of this waste is done in (field- waste) municipal surface. Those waste disposals have not filled the minimum standard requirements for waste. They are settled near habitats and rivers, which most of time end up polluting the rivers also, especially underground waters and wells. Oftentimes those waste disposals are burned from nature, as well as from people. During summer they smell badly because most of waste is not even covered with grit. Some disposals in Pristina have been closed, with the aim to reduce those negative effects in the nature; however, still most of them remain uncovered. Pristina regional waste disposal collects waste from Prishtin√´, Obiliq, Lipjan, Fush√´ Kosov√´ and Drenas(Gllogoc). The size of this disposal is approximately 40 hectares, it has a life span of 15 years, and its total capacity is 3,500,000 m while its monthly capacity is 6000 tons. The status of this disposal is miserable, with a very bad smell causing many health implications to people. ===Local waste=== As the capital city of Kosovo, Pristina has the largest number of inhabitants, which in turn means that it has the largest amount of waste disposal. Generation, collection, treatment, and elimination of waste in Pristinais done by \\"Pastrimi\\" Company, which covers the highest percentage of people with this service compared to other municipalities. In 2007 this company covered 64% of the population with this service, in 2008 52%, in 2009 53%, and in 2010 55%. Collection of waste is done through two ways: 52% door-to-door collection and 48% for collective apartments. {  - !Vendi i grumbullimit !! Banesa kolektive !! Dere me dere !!

The total amount of waste collected in Pristina is 248,832 ton. (cite 37) The collection of local waste in Pristina has increased from 2007 to 2012. In 2007 182,000 ton were collected, while in 2012 249,000 ton were collected. This is an example of an increase in the efficiency of waste collection. If Pristina is compared with the other regions, the collection of waste per capita is much higher. Only in 2012, the difference between Pristina and other regions collection of waste was 0.7 kg. ===Industrial waste=== Industrial waste contains substances in various aggregate forms that remained for a long time in different facilities, warehouses, and industrial units. Over time, the usage of some of these substances has expired or degraded by changing their composition, making them as highly hazardous substances for people‚Äôs health. {  - ! Type of waste !!

This sector in Pristina does not have a system of collection, transportation, or elimination. Even though new waste disposals have been set in hospital as well as in medicinal family centers, they are not being used as much. Medicinal pills are thrown in normal waste disposals. When medicinal pills stay for a long time without valid usage time, then they release dangerous substances for human‚Äôs health. The Municipal Family Medicine Center in Pristina releases 60 tons/year medicinal waste. Medicinal waste is found also in some pharmacies in Pristina. The central pharmacy of Pristina has declared 200 kg of medical waste. Other pharmacies have also reported medical waste, such as the Agani Warehouse. ===Law on waste=== For more information visit: Kosovo Law on Waste Factsheet for Kosovo under UNSCR 1244/99 ==Land degradation== The continued impact of human activities on land causes land degradation, which is harmful for human and socio-economic environment. Since Pristina is the capital city of Kosovo, most of the population lives here. This means that land degradation issue is more present in the Pristina region; however, Pristina was always industrial-oriented city, with less agricultural land used for food cultivation. Land degradation happens because of the increased construction of settlements (unplanned constructions), road construction, industry (solid waste, surface mining), local and sanitary waste, erosion and uncontrolled exploitation of gravel. ===Land usage=== Below are some facts for land usage in Pristina Municipality: Constructed Land: 2365.6 hectares or 30.45% of the total surface Residential Areas: 2011.58 hectares. It is characterized with individual residence 23.17%, with only 2.72% collective residence. Economic Areas: 217.94 hectares or 2.81% of total constructed areas belongs to the industrial development. Educational Institutions: occupy a surface of 34.7 hectares or 0.45% of the constructed area Health Institutions: occupy a surface of 33.9 hectares or 0.44% of the constructed area Administrative Institutions: occupy a surface of 50.08 hectares or 0.64% of the constructed area Green Areas: 5023.05 hectares or 64.04% of the total area Specific Areas: 149.11 hectares or 1.92% of the total area Transport and Traffic Areas: 231 hectares or 2.97% of total area Ownership in Pristina Municipality is divided into two groups: Public Ownership: 2695.21 hectares or 34.7% Private Ownership: 5073.48 hectares or 65.3% ===Degradation of agricultural land=== Pristina has 9,155 hectares of agricultural land, from which 8508 hectares have the system of irrigation on them. Since Pristina has highly polluted air, then it is thought that this emission of pollution is transferred from air to land. This happens through rainfall that dissolves air pollution and deposits it into the land. One of the most common ways of agricultural land degradation is the transformation of agricultural land into industrial land. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Development, in the period from 1998-2006 1 hectare of land in Pristina was transformed. However, the construction of Pristina started the last five years, with more people building apartments in each neighborhood of Pristina. The problem of land degradation is that it happens in both ways: through the permission of the municipality of Pristina, but also without the permission of the municipality of Pristina. According to the director of the agricultural association in Kosovo, land degradation is happening each day more and more, and the most dangerous zones to remain without agricultural land are lands between Pristina and Skopje highway. ===Laws on land degradation=Spatial planning== Spatial planning in Pristina is very important, given the enormous construction plans happening currently. The construction of collective apartments has started in Pristina the last five years, and some of them follow the directives for constructing from Pristina Municipality, but others do not. However, when dealing with spatial planning, it is very important to protect local zones from construction, especially parks that people use for recreational activities. One of the natural spatial areas protected from the municipality of Pristina is the national park \\"Germia.\\" ===Protected zones ‚Äì Germia=== -Germia national park Pristina 2014-01-29 12-19 The regional park \\"Germia\\" is protected and monitored from the public enterprise \\"Hortikultura.\\" This park is protected from construction, as well as because of its biodiversity in fauna and flora. Germia lies in the northern part of Pristina and it has a surface of 62 km2. The boundaries of Germia starts with vineyards fields in the west, continues with Miredita hills in the east toward the Hajvalia mining and Gracanica River. In the south, it continues with Busise River, and in the east it ends up with Badovci River. Besides of its geographic boundaries, Germia is protected because of its diversity in flora and fauna. 610 types of vascular flora have been found in Germia separated into 82 families. 83 types of mushrooms have been found and 4 forest communities. It is the only place of Pristina where the air pollution is lower, and most people use it as a recreational place. 41.40.52 hectares of Germia are under the protected zone, starting from the Germia Basis and continue with fields, children parks and toys, and sporting centers. The status of Germia is a Protected Regional Park, including 1.126.01.00 hectares. Germia Park is evidenced as a protected zone in the international list of protected places. ===Laws on spatial planning=== For more information visit: Kosovo Law on Spatial Planning ==Environmental protection measures== During 2011‚Äì2012, the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning in Kosovo, has formulated the Strategy for the protection of the Environment in Pristina. Those strategies have been created for the future of Pristina environment in 2015-2022. Those strategies entail specific plans and EU standards that Pristina needs to fulfill by the end of year 2022. Local Plans for Environmental Actions are mandatory for each municipality in Kosovo. In Pristina, this plan has been approved and it only waits for the starting period of implementation. This plan has been taken in cooperation with the Swedish Agence for International Development. The municipality of Pristina is developing and implementing this plan for other municipalities as well. 14 plans have been established for waste management in Pristina, according to the Kosovo Law for Waste.

These courses were held in IDI and were mainly concerned about the basic elements of using Linux and its benefits with other systems. In June of that year, some of the students continued to teach lessons about Linux.Linux Course Project ===OpenStreetMap=== OpenStreetMap is one of the projects which contributes mostly for Open Source in Kosovo. Many members from the Open Street Map community have worked on this project companies like 'LogisticPlus ' and other companies as well. Its beginnings have been seen in the map which was made for the Brod town. It was about \\"Brod\\" town which was endangered from environmental damages on them mountains of Sharri. This project was introduced by Joachim Bergerhoff who told to Flossk that UN-HABITAT has project for them. Flossk helped in the development of this project.Mapping Brod Shkodra, Albania The map which was created by community included cities and towns as: Brod, Gjilan, Gjakov√´, Ferizaj, Prizren, Pej√´, Prishtin√´. Another project was also the project for Shkodra, when in 2010 the community had helped the survivors of flooding to find the streets.Giscorps.org about OSMOSM project ===Kumevotu.info=== The project 'kumevotu.info' is a project of the youngsters of Flossk for less than two weeks. The duty of this project was to help people to find the place where to vote. This project was held until 12 December 2010 and was dedicated especially for the elections of the year 2010. The project was based on Open Street Map, where the user gives his personal data and then in an interesting map he can find the place where he should vote. The project was very useful, even for the youngsters who participated in creating it.Ku me votu ProjectKu me votu - telegrafi.com ===OLPC=== OLPC project OLPC was one of the most attractive projects of Open source in Kosovo because it was dedicated to children. OLPC was a project which was dedicated to poor places where the basic thing is a laptop which is used by children to learn the system of Linux. This laptop was based on a version of Fedora and it had some basic applications. It was also equipped with WiFi where people could browse in internet and learn new things. This project was supported since the first steps of Flossk and in different conferences. The project was very welcomed in Kosovo. OLPC project ===Wikipedia project=== The Albanian community of open source in Kosovo has been active in the field of Wikipedia and Wikimedia. This community has been dealing mainly with promoting open knowledge in Wikipedia by translating it in Albanian so it made easier for the community to be informed about everything. This initiative was made by Flossk, and it resulted with 31,458 articles in Albanian language. In 2013, a conference was held, called 'WikiacademyKosovo', which is a direct way of adding articles in Wikipedia.Wikipedia-wikimedia ProjectWiciacademy Kosovo project ===Fedora project=== The project 'Fedora' is one of the open source projects which is also active in Kosovo. It is promoted and distributed from its two ambassadors in Kosovo: Ardian Haxha and Gent Thaqi. Flossk in association with ambassadors of Fedras in Kosovo always it organizes parties to announce for new versions.Fedora Project FlOSSK, Mozilla Projects ===Mozilla project=== Mozilla Firefox community is active in Kosovo. One of the other projects of Flossk was also promoting the Mozilla Project.

The first part of the project was charged with Firefox and OpenOffice.org, and the second part was charged with Linux. From 3rd to 6 November in that year 70% of municipality had computer network in English language OpenOffice.org and Firefox in Albanian. The proliferation of open source software products have benefits from many companies and government of Kosovo because the costs are significantly lower and security is higher. UNDP FOSS Club has also trained municipal employees. A survey conducted at the end of training 100% of employees stated that prefer the software to be in Albanian language. The project for the translation of OpenOffice.org in Albanian language started in that year. UNDP FOSS team consisted of members from Bulgaria and Kosovo.Pr- tech about open source in Municipality of Klina ==Richard Stallman's visit in Kosovo== On 4 June 2010, Richard Stallman, an activist and programmer of free software, visited Kosovo. He lectured on the topic \\"A Free Digital Society\\" at the National Library of Kosovo. The lecture, which was about the freedom of the digital society and the threats that have to do with it, was very welcomed by a large number of the participants. During his lecture, Richard Stallman mentioned many countries where digital freedom was directly violated, such as Denmark, Australia, and other countries, where many webpages have been closed for unclear reasons. He emphasized that the presence of free software and freedom in educational institutions is really necessary for the countries that want to advance their societies to use the free software and who do not want to be dependent on software that they have to pay for. He also emphasized: At the end, Richard Stallman answered many questions put forth by the participants in the room.Telegrafi.com about Richard Stallman visit in KosovoPCworld.al about Richard Stallman visitDigjitale.com about RSMKosovoguide.com about Richard Stallman visit ==Wiki Academy Kosovo== The winner of the contest Wiki Academy Kosovo During 22‚Äì24 February 2013, at the Faculty of Education near University of Pristina, the first academy was held, which was called: WikiacademyKosovo. The idea of this conference was to promote Kosovo in the digital world and to emphasize its good things through new and qualitative articles and pictures in Wikimedia. The propaganda which is present against Kosovo is a threat for the idea what Kosovo is as a country. Academy revealed articles about cultural heritage, social issue, geography, institutions, economy, and tourism; it was also a starting point to improve the actual image about Kosovo. A number of mentors of Wikipedia were present in this event in which they advised the writers about their writings, whereas the writings became more qualitative. The winners of the academy were writings such as: *Archaeology of Kosovo ‚Äì Atdhe Prelvukaj, *Classical Music in Kosovo- Liburn Jupolli, Mic Sokoli, Edona Vatoci, *Information and Communications Technology in Kosovo- Dardan Ahmeti. This academy was supported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Kosovo, the Great Britain Embassy, the Royal Embassy of Norway, British Council, IPKO foundation and Kosovar organization FLOSSK.Ministry of foreign affairs about Wikiacademy albinfo.ch about Wikiacademytelegrafi.com about Wikiacademyikub.al MPJ organizon gar√´n ‚ÄúWiki Academy Kosovo univerzum - Kolegji Universum perkrah Wiki Academy Kosovo 2013.

The mission of the library is to collect, preserve, promote and make accessible the documentary and intellectual heritage of Kosovo. It holds exhibitions and holds an archive of national newspapers. The library also provides a number of other services. It is known for its unique history, and the style of the building designed by Croatian architect Andrija Mutnjakoviƒá, followed by controversies about the outside appearance of it. Bird's-eye-view of the building == History Founding=== The history of libraries in Kosovo dates back to the 14th and 15th centuries. Collections of the Christian and Muslim religious communities are considered as the oldest archives libraries in Kosovo. Kosovo's institutional library was officially founded in December 1944 in the city of Prizren, which at the time was the capital of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo. In 1982 the library was moved to the current building which was built in Pristina, the current capital of Kosovo. Over the years the National Library's name has changed depending on the political position of Kosovo. { border=\\"1\\"  ! Years !! Name -  1944‚Äì1952  Regional Library of Autonomous Province of Kosovo -  1956‚Äì1961  The Library Center of the Autonomous Province of Kosova and Metohija -  1961‚Äì1970  The National Provincial Library -  1970‚Äì1990  The National and University Library of Kosovo -  1990‚Äì1999  The National and University Library of Kosovo and Metohija -  1999‚Äì2014  The National and University Library of Kosovo -  2014- current  The National Library of Kosovo } Note that the former official names of the National Library of Kosovo are originally in Albanian and can be found in the library's journal Bibloletra ===1989‚Äì1999=== In 1989, Kosovo's status as an autonomous region of Serbia was revoked, tens of thousands of Kosovo Albanians working in the public sector lost their jobs, and Albanian students were prohibited from taking courses in the Albanian language. For public and private libraries in Kosovo, this was a time when many library collections were burned and destroyed. The library was subsequently used to house a large number of refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia who had fled their countries due to the Yugoslav Wars. After NATO's occupation of Kosovo in June 1999, it was revealed that the Yugoslav Army had used the library as a command-and-control centre. The materials inside had been stolen, reading room furniture smashed, and the card catalogue had been dumped in the basement. The library workers were kept out for a week while Kosovo Force (KFOR) peacekeeping troops checked the building for any hidden explosives. According to national and international organizations, about 100,000 Albanian-language books have been sent to the paper mill in Lipjan for pulping. Among those books were collections of national heritage, which explained the nation's origins and history. ===Reorganization=== After the war in Kosovo there was a great will and desire to reconstruct the library buildings and re-establish library services at all levels. This was done with the assistance of a special group of experts from UNESCO, the Council of Europe (CoE) and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). This special group of experts created different training programs like: Legislation and Administration, Mobile Library, Reconstruction, Book and Reading, Information Technology Professional Training and Development, Cultural Heritage, Children and Youth, Open Access Programme, Initiative Support, Twinning. During the years of reorganization the National Library of Kosovo has been aided by many institutions such as the US Embassy, OSCE, Zentralbibliothek Z√ºrich, German Artist Initiatives, Raiffeisen Bank. ==Architecture Building === Another outside look of the Library focusing on the domes.The most significant part of the current library is its building. There are contradictory opinions about its style, which have resulted in different versions regarding the building. The current building of the National Library of Kosovo was inaugurated on 25 November 1982. It was designed by the Croatian architect Andrija Mutnjakoviƒá. Its space consists of 16,500 square meters. It is made with zenith windows, with a total 99 domes of different sizes and is entirely covered in a metal fishing net, which have their own particular architectural symbolism. It houses two reading rooms with 300 and 100 seats respectively, a reading room for periodicals, rooms for special collections, cataloguing and research, a 150-seat amphitheatre and a 75-seat meeting hall. It has the capacity to accommodate about two million volumes. The materials are located on two levels below ground and are closed to the public. The lobby of the library is used for various cultural events. The floor of the hall is a unique work of diverse mosaic marble stone. The largest dome of the library is the main ornament of the hall's high ceiling, thus providing ample natural lighting. Main hall, National Library of Kosovo.JPGThe main hall with the marble floor. Amphitheater, National Library of Kosovo.JPGOne of the amphitheatres inside the Library. Reading room, National Library of Kosovo.JPGOne of the reading rooms inside the Library. Hall, National Library of Kosovo.JPGThe view to the third floor. === Style and controversy === Inside view of one of the domes. According to the architect of the National Library of Kosovo the building is meant to represent a style blending Byzantine and Islamic architectural forms. In other sources there are statements from the actual architect that ‚Äúthis project which is linked to the tradition of pre-Romanesque architecture of the Balkans, was being considered among other project for the Sarajevo National Library building‚Äù. By others this building is seen as a reaction to the impersonality of International Style and an attempt to combine modern means with regional traditions and rural architecture, but also as a Modern-Metabolist style. Despite the official statements of the architect about the style of the National Library of Kosovo there are many other controversies when it comes to the appearance of the building and its meaning. One of the most famous versions is the one that connects the domes of the building with the national Albanian hat ‚Äúplisi‚Äù. This was the reason why Serbian politicians reacted very strongly about the appearance of the building. Another version is that this project was meant to reconcile the relations between Serbians and Albanians. Its domes are a combination of existing Turkish baths in Prizren and Patriarchate of Peƒá.

Also, it is responsible for supplying information for higher education and research, and access to various databases. === Collections === The National Library of Kosovo has 1,890,194 library units, with 475,324 titles, which 382,806 of them are books, 281,591 are magazines, 984,022 newspapers and 241,775 other units. Between 2004 and 2009 the library was enriched with 30,000 new titles. In 2013 the number of the library's collections reached 2 million units. Collections of rare old books, old newspapers and magazines, Albanian manuscripts with Latin, Greek and Arabic graphics are a precious treasure of cultural heritage stored in this institution. Also, maps, photo documents and other valuable documents present a great cultural heritage. The oldest book found in the National Library is Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis by Marin Barleti, written in Latin. === Cataloging and classification === National Library of Kosovo uses three international cataloging standards. AACR2 which is ISNC standard, ISBD which is IFLA standard and MARC 21 standard. The National Library of Kosovo uses two standard classification of materials, Universal Decimal Classification and Subject Classification. ==Visits== Anyone may use National Library services, but people must be at least 18 years old to request and order materials from the collections. Items of the Library cannot be borrowed for home use and must be read in one of the reading rooms. About 5,000 users are registered every year, making it the most frequented library in Kosovo. and is one of the most visited attractions in Kosovo. ==Organization== The National Library is a state institution which reports to the Ministry of Culture and it is regulated by law. There are several mini libraries inside the National Library like the American Corner, Library of Contemporary Art, NATO Library, Music Library, Library for the Blind, Fehmi Agani Library, Library of Krist Maloki, Authors Archive Library, etc. ==Digital library== An analog catalog found in the National Library of Kosovo Digitization for the National Library of Kosovo is a project of great importance. During this process, the National Library of Kosovo aims to put online the national heritage and other materials dealing with Kosovo to promote them and to make it easier for natives and individuals from other countries to have access to it. In 2008, with a view to developing a portal resembling the American Memory, Memory (), the Documentary Centre of Kosovo was established. Due to the very large number of documents that must digitized, a process that takes a lot of time, the Library has established a sequence of criteria for documents that must be digitized before others and one of the basic criteria is the cultural and historical value of that material. Based on those criteria, these are the documents that have priority in digitization : most requested material which is in poor physical condition, historical books and manuscripts, microfilms and other very required materials. In general, materials that are most commonly digitized are rare books (49%), photographs (44%), manuscripts (39%), monographs (35%), music (30%), newspapers (9%), maps (1%). Besides digitizing its own material the National Library of Kosovo provides access to some of the most popular electronic resources in the world and that made possible through the Electronic Library Consortium of Kosovo. For services for electronic resources in different libraries of the world the National Library of Kosovo was supported by Kosovo Foundation for Open Society, and by companies like EBSCO and GALE with financial support from the U.S. Embassy in Pristina. While Raiffeisen Bank Kosovo supported the Oxford Music Online and the OSCE Mission in Kosovo supported OXFORD Scholarship Online and Oxford Journal. == Other libraries in Pristina == There are many other libraries in Kosovo, such as the Library of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo, Albanology Institute Library Pristina, Hivzi Sulejmani Public Library, and other school and faculty libraries, which are developed in scientific and educational institutions. One of the main goals of the National Library of Kosovo is the establishment and reactivation of many new libraries in order to develop the librarianship of Kosovo. ==Gallery== Dome1_National_Library_of_Kosovo.JPG Biblioteka_Komb√´tare_dhe_Universitare_e_Kosov√´s.jpg LibraryPrishtina.JPG NationalLibrary.jpg === Notes = References  *Biblioteka Komb√´tare e Kosov√´s \\"Pjet√´r Bogdani\\" *Biblioteka \\"HIVZI SULEJMANI\\" *Akademia e Shkancave dhe Arteve te Kosoves * The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions Category:Culture in Pristina Category:Buildings and structures in Pristina Category:ISBN agencies Category:World Digital Library partners Category:Deposit libraries Category:Tourist attractions in Pristina Category:Libraries in Kosovo Category:Cultural heritage monuments in Prishtina District ","title":"National Library of Kosovo"},{"id":"42091593","text":"287x287pxPristina, the capital of Kosovo, houses a great number of public and private institutions that have withstood the different periods that this country has experienced, fulfilling the academic aspirations of many generations. Pristina is known for its many educational institutions such as the University \\"Hasan Prishtina\\", the National Library of Kosovo, and the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Kosovo. Throughout the last century Pristina has attracted a considerable number of students from Kosovo. Today, the city of Pristina hosts a considerable number of intellectuals, professors, academics, students, and professionals in various spheres. == Education in Pristina in the Past  The Foundation of Educational Institutions in Pristina === Among the first schools known in Pristina were those opened during the Ottoman period‚Äîthat is before 1912.\\"The History, Culture and Identity of Albanians in Kosovo\\", Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, The History, Culture and Identity of Albanians in Kosovo, 1 May 1997,accessed 23 February 2014. Albanians were allowed to attend these schools, most of which were religious, with only few of them being secular. During 1913, in Pristina, few Serbian-language primary schools and gymnasiums were opened.\\"Shifra dhe fakte per Arsimin e Kosoves\\" , KEC, p.54 The period that followed the Ottoman rule, between 1916 and 1918 was also important for the educational system in Kosovo. During this period, Pristina, along with other municipalities such as Ferizaj and Prizren, was occupied by Bulgaria. Bulgarian occupier did not allow Albanian-language schools, however because of the positive impact of the Austro-Hungarians in the Bulgarian area, some religious catholic schools were allowed in Pristina and other municipalities occupied by them. In 1916, the Bulgarian National Gymnasium was opened in Pristina. The situation in terms of education was worse in the region under the rule of Bulgaria compared to the region occupied by Austro-Hungarian forces where 300 Albanian-language schools were allowed to be opened. === Education during the period under Yugoslavia and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia === During 1919-1939 in Yugoslavia, all Albanian-language schools were closed and education was allowed only in Serbo-Croatian. Around four (4) percent of Yugoslav people attended secondary education, with rural areas being the regions with the lowest numbers of participants since access to schools was almost nonexistent. During this period, the most marginalized group who was deprived from attending schools were girls coming from Muslim families. During the World War II Kosovo joined with Albania under Italian occupation. This marked a positive turn in the educational system in Kosovo and Prishtina/Pristina in particular since schools in Albanian language were allowed to be opened. Besides hundreds of primary schools opened in Pristina, the first high school in the Albanian language in this municipality, Sami Frasheri, was also founded.\\"Shifra dhe fakte per Arsimin e Kosoves\\" , KEC, p.57 After the World War II, Kosovo was again part of Yugoslavia. During this period, ethnic Albanians were recognized as a national minority and Albanian language was accepted and Albanian- language primary schools were allowed while higher levels of education were offered still only in Serbo-Croatian. In 1968, the constitution was amended to allow the opening of Albanian-language schools at all levels. After the WWII, education in Kosovo was provided in three languages: Serbian, Albanian, and Turkish, while after 1953 lessons in these three languages were offered in the same school. After 1968, the foundation of Albanian-language educational institutions continued. In 1969, the Albanian University of Pristina was opened. Texts and teaching materials were imported from Albania, as part of an agreement between the University of Tirana and that of Pristina in 1970. In 1981, the University of Pristina consisted of 75 per cent ethnic Albanians out of the 47,000 students attending it. During the late 70s and early 80s the economic situation in Kosovo and Yugoslavia was worsening. Furthermore, negative discrimination of students based on ethnicity led Albanian students of the University of Pristina to organize a massive protest on March 11, 1981, known as the Student Protests of 1981.\\"Shifra dhe fakte per Arsimin e Kosoves\\" , KEC, p.63 As a result of violent student riots, restrictions in the education of Albanians were imposed again. As a result of this protest, the previous agreement between Albania and Kosovo, to exchange educational materials, ended and Serbo-Croatian books started to be translated in Albanian to fulfil the needs of the university. Further, students, teachers and professors who participated in these protests were expelled, thus resulting in more than 260 students and more than 210 teachers/professors expelled. === The context during the period under Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro === During the period of abolition of Kosovo's autonomy (1989-1990), education in Kosovo faced further changes. A new curriculum concentrated more in covering Serbian culture and history and that made Serbo- Croatian a compulsory subject in Kosovo high schools was adopted in 1990. Further, students who wanted to enter secondary schools had to pass a Serbian language test. As a result, after 1992, there were left only Albanian-language elementary schools while in secondary schools and Pristina University Serbian was the only language of instruction.  Private Albanian schools  In the 1990s, Kosovars established a parallel education system as a temporary solution to the situation created during that period. Around 300-450,000 students boycotted the state educational institutions and attended the parallel Albanian-language private schools. For a period of more than six years, Albanian-Kosovar students attended parallel primary and secondary schools and were unable to attend University as they were neither allowed to enter nor attend the University or Pristina. These private/parallel schools were located in mosques, private houses, garages, etc. On September 1, 1996, President of Serbia, Milo≈°eviƒá and Kosovar leader, Rugova signed an agreement that would allow ethnic Albanian students and teachers to return to schools. However, this agreement was never implemented and this led to protest held between October 1997 and January 1998. Again, during these protests a number of the students were arrested and beaten by the police. On March 23, 1998, another agreement was signed that allowed Albanian students to return to schools and in the University of Pristina. However, this agreement did not allow the integration of Albanian students and pupils with the Serbian ones. To maintain this, a shift schedule was applied so that Serb students attended the lectures in the morning and Albanians in the afternoon. In response to this agreement and as a way to show their disagreement, Serb students and professors at the University of Pristina organized a protest where 10,000 people were gathered. === The Context during the period and after the ethnic- conflict in 1998-1999 === After the conflict, United Mission in Kosovo started working in establishing educational institutions. UNMIK authorities tried to establish schools that would work in a unified system and students be taught in their language of choice.\\"Parallel worlds ‚Äì Rebuilding the education system in Kosovo\\", IIEP, p.8 Among the first changes to be adopted in 2001 were the new curriculum framework and changes in the organization of educational system.\\"Kosovo ‚Äì Rebuilding the education system after civil conflict \\" , Amanda Crawford, accessed on 23 February 2014 During the time that UNMIK authorities were trying to set up education authorities and institutions in Pristina, Serbian and Albanian education officials restarted schools in this city.\\"Parallel worlds ‚Äì Rebuilding the education system in Kosovo\\", IIEP, p.50 One factor that had an impact in the education policy-making in Kosovo during that time was the increasing urbanization. According to some estimates, the number of people living in Pristina tripled in size since before the NATO campaign from around 200,000 residents before the conflict to about 650,000 in 2002.\\"Parallel worlds ‚Äì Rebuilding the education system in Kosovo\\", IIEP, p.58 As of 2007-2008, in Pristina, eleven schools (11) were operating in two (2) shifts while one school was operating in fours (4) shifts, due to the high number of pupils.\\"Treguesit dhe t√´ dh√´nat statistikore n√´ arsim 2004/05, 05/06, 06/07\\" , MEST, p.40 Among other problems that existed during that time in Pristina related to education, were the high drop-out rates between primary and secondary school for girls, ethnic minorities and children in rural areas.\\"Parallel worlds ‚Äì Rebuilding the education system in Kosovo\\", IIEP, p.60 Further, in relation to teacher and professor, the major problem was regarding their salaries. At that time, salaries for faculty at the main campus in Pristina were quite low.

As of 2001, there were more than 19,000 students enrolled. === The context during after Kosovo's Declaration of Independence ===  Regulating Authority  After the declaration of Independence, decision-making institutions continued in formulating and adopting education related policies, laws and regulations. The educational competences of the municipality of Pristina are regulated with the Law No. 03/L-068 on Education in the Municipalities of the Republic of Kosovo. Article 4 foresees the exclusive powers of the municipalities as far as the local interest is concerned, while acting in accordance with the applicable legislation with respect to the provisions of public pre-primary, primary and secondary education. Some of the competences of the municipality of Pristina, and other municipalities, include registration and admission of students, license of all public educational institutions, employment of teachers and other school personnel, selection of the Director and/or Deputy Director of educational institutions, payment of the managerial staff as well as other employed personnel, training educators and other professional staff and supervision and inspection of the education processLaw No. 03/L-068 On Education in the Municipalities of the Republic of Kosovo. http://gazetazyrtare.rks-gov.net/Documents/anglisht-85.pdf Additionally, according to the Law on Local Self Government municipalities are entitled to cooperate with other municipalities and other authorities, including municipalities, institutions and government agencies in the Republic of Serbia, within the field of education. Law Nr. 03/L-040 On Local Self Government. http://gazetazyrtare.rks-gov.net/Documents/anglisht-76.pdf As far higher education is concerned, the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) have all the competences and responsibilities. It is foreseen with the Law on Education in the Municipalities of the Republic of Kosovo and the Law on Higher Education that the aforementioned Ministry is responsible for planning the development of higher education in Kosovo, regulating public and private providers of higher education, promoting equality of opportunity in access and admission to higher education, in staff development and training, establishing a State Council for Higher Education, which advises the Minister on higher education matters, licensing private providers of higher education, and other responsibilities as foreseen by the Law.Law No. 04/L-037 On Higher Education in the Republic of Kosovo. http://gazetazyrtare.rks- gov.net/Documents/Ligji%20per%20arsimin%20e%20larte%20(anglisht).pdf == Contemporary Situation of Education in Pristina  Education Sector in Pristina Today, the challenges it faces and the way forward === The Local Government Elections of 2013 produced a new leadership in the Municipality of Pristina. The new Mayor of Pristina, Shpend Ahmeti representing the 'Vetevendosje' or self-determination movement highlighted that during his mandate the area of education is the main priority.\\"Arsimi Ne Prishtine.\\" Per Prishtinn. Vetvendosje, n.d. Web. 02 Mar. 2014. Currently in the city of Pristina there are only eight public preschools, in which 1,886 children attend education while overall there are 2,074 pupils aged 5‚Äì6 years attend pre-primary class in Pristina. 80 percent of children aged 0‚Äì6 years are outside the system. In fact, families who succeed to enrol their children in public kindergartens are very privileged because demand exceeds supply up to tenfold. Based on the Kosovo Agency of Statistics, during years 2011 and 2012 in Pristina there were 7,685 children born from mothers with permanent residence in Pristina.  Current issues affecting Education in Pristina are  * Child-Teacher Ratio ‚Äî For 10-15 children aged 1‚Äì2 years there is only one teacher while for children aged 2‚Äì3 years there is only one teacher for 15 or more children * Lack of reading areas in most public kindergartens. These areas are essential reading for children's mental development * Most public kindergartens do not have facilities for gymnastics or sports fields. While preschool institutions in addition to the role that they play in children's mental development, they have to care also for the physical development of children * Pristina has 40 private kindergartens. The cost of sending ones child to a private kindergarten in relation to the living standards are quite high and mostly difficult to be affordable for most parents since this drains 80 to 100 euros, while the average income is 250-400 EUR. Moreover, a large number of these kindergartens work without a license and they often accept more children than their capacity can handle, resulting in low quality education but also increasing risks to children. While the licensing is a jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, the Pristina Municipality has failed to collect accurate data on how many of these kindergartens operate and how The city of Pristina has 41 primary schools and lower secondary schools with 34,342 students (MED 2011-2012). Within the city there are 22 primary and secondary schools (including Jakova Prenk music school) and the major problems that need to be resolved are: * The large number of students in elementary and secondary schools. Resulting in a situation that affects the quality of education attained and student success. Besides the lack of school facilities, student enrolment is often done without certain criteria. There are cases when parents enrol their children in schools that are not in their neighbourhood but go after the best schools Another problem highlighted is that high schools in Pristina are forced to accept students coming from other municipalities because of specific profiles that are missing in these municipalities - which has led to overloading of classes.  Latest Reforms  The first decision undertaken by the new leadership in the Municipality of Pristina, under Mayor Shpend Ahmeti was to increase transparency in the process of interviewing education personnel. The decision enables the participation of the parent council, student council, civil society, and media in interviewing candidates for the selection of educational staff.\\"Kuadrot Arsimore T√´ Prishtin√´s Intervistohen Publikisht.\\" Gazeta Jeta N√´ Kosov√´.

He designed, animated, and produced multiple games for Williams Electronics, Midway Games, Cybiko, and MumboJumbo. ==Biography== Newcomer was born in Granger, Indiana, the second of two children. His father, Robert, was a milkman and then a maintenance worker in a movie theater. His mother, Beverly, was an administrative assistant and office manager. Newcomer attended Clay High School in South Bend, Indiana, where coincidentally one of his friends in the school chess club was Franz Lanzinger, who also ended up in the coin-op industry, working for Atari and designing games such as Crystal Castles. Newcomer attended Notre Dame University, graduating in 1977 with a degree in industrial design. His first job was at Gordon Barlow Design in Skokie, Illinois, the company known for famous games and toys such as Mouse Trap and Toy Bomb. Newcomer worked as part of a team that generated over 100 new products through the prototype stage, some of which then went on to be manufactured by companies such as Hasbro, Mego, and Ideal. In 1981, Newcomer moved to Williams Electronics. The company had had a recent success with the 1980 game Defender, and believing video games to be the future of entertainment, sought new creative staff. To emphasize his creative spirit, Newcomer submitted his resume stuffed down the throat of a rubber chicken, and got the job. After a few days on staff, he generated a list of game ideas that included one based on The War of the Worlds and another for Joust. His vision for War of the Worlds was not technically feasible with the hardware at the time, but Joust was possible with Williams' existing hardware, and development began. Newcomer's initial vision was of Joust as a \\"flying game\\" with co- operative two-player gameplay. Rather than emulate the popular space theme of previous successful flying games such as Asteroids and Defender, he wanted to offer an alternative to spaceships. He made a list of things that could fly: machines, animals, and fictional characters. After evaluating the positive and negative of each idea, he chose birds, believing that they would have a wide appeal, choosing an ostrich and a stork as the main characters, with vultures as the enemies. The decision to use birds also prompted Newcomer to deviate from the then standard eight-direction joystick. He implemented a \\"flapping\\" mechanism to allow players to control the character's ascent and descent. With the vertical direction controlled via the arcade cabinet's button, a two-way joystick was added to dictate horizontal direction. Other games Newcomer helped design included the #1 coin-op games High Impact Football and its sequel Super High Impact. Williams Electronics eventually sold off the division which became Midway Games. Newcomer worked there as Senior Game Designer for 18 years until 1999, then moving to become Director of Game Design at Cybiko from 2000-2003, and VP of Game Design at In-Fusio from 2003-2007\\\\. He then was hired by MumboJumbo in 2007, serving first as General Manager of the Dallas Studio, and then transitioning to Director of Game Design. ==Awards== ; Joust Joust has been listed in multiple sources as one of the more memorable games of its time, part of the Golden Age. In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it at number sixty-nine arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact. Kevin Bowen of GameSpy's Classic Gaming wrote that despite a concept he described as \\"incredibly stupid\\", Joust is an appealing game with good controls and competitive gameplay. Bowen further commented that the multiplayer aspect differentiated the game from others at the time. He described it as \\"one of the first really fun multiplayer games\\" and a precursor to the video game deathmatch. ; Other games * Top Hidden Object Game of 2012, Gamezebo, Angelica Weaver: Catch Me When You Can ==Works== * Joust, coin-op game * Joust 2: Survival of the Fittest, coin- op * Tri-Sports, 1989 coin-op * Turkey Shoot, coin-op * TouchMaster, #1 touch- screen coin-op game * Sinistar, coin-op * NBA Jam, coin-op, animator (1st version), #1 in its genre * Revolution X, coin-op, animator, #1 in its genre * Gilligan's Island Pinball, coin-op (Newcomer did the dot matrix, the first to have digitized images) * Star Rider, coin-op, Newcomer was manager in charge of game design * Angelica Weaver, PC and mobile download, hidden object adventure * Midnight Mysteries, PC and mobile download, hidden object adventure * 7 Wonders sequels, match-3 game for PC and mobile download * Pickers, hidden object for PC/mobile * Samantha Swift (four titles), PC download, hidden object games * Luxor: Quest for the Afterlife, co-designer, ball-shooter game * Zombie Bowl-O-Rama, bowling game, co-designer * Narc (1988), coin-op, animator == References  * Category:Living people Category:American video game designers Category:1955 births Category:People from Granger, Indiana ","title":"John Newcomer"},{"id":"42091623","text":"Expokos Fair being held in Pristina Fairs in Pristina started since the medieval period, at the time when it was famous for its annual trade fairs and its goat hide and goat hair articles. Pristina always had a development in trading due to its position in the Balkan trade routes. Despite that fact, Pristina, or Kosovo in general, is not known for occurrence of fairs. With the development of culture and especially after the last war in 1999, Pristina has had progress on holding these kinds of events. Every year, various types of trade fairs take place in the capital city. The essence of these fairs is usually temporary; some last only an afternoon while others may last around 3 days, a week or even longer. They have grown in size and importance over the years. These fairs are organized annually and are open to trade visitors and public. The number of exhibitors and visitors is usually very high. ==Fairs== {  - ! Nr !! Fair !! Date !!

During the reign of Charles II, Danvers appears to have suffered for his nonconformity. Allegations were made against him, and in June 1661 he and Clement Ireton were rumoured to be planning a rebellion. In 1662 informers linked his name to the \\"Tong Plot\\", but he escaped arrest. Around 1663, reports had Danvers in disguise visiting the ejected minister Anthony Palmer, and linked to other radical plotters: the imprisoned John Breman, George Joyce in the Netherlands, and John Toomes. In August 1665 he was in fact arrested, however he was rescued whilst being taken to the Tower of London.the Diary of Samuel Pepys; entry for August 5, 1665 Danvers vested his estate with trustees, to shelter it; and was joint-elder of a Baptist congregation near Aldgate, London. In the late 1670s he supported Algernon Sidney in efforts to be elected a Member of Parliament. In December 1684 he published a seditious libel concerning the death of the Earl of Essex, and the government offered a reward for his apprehension. In the reign of James II, Danvers attended private meetings planning Monmouth's Rebellion. William Disney briefed John Wildman and Danvers, who was cautious; he may have undertaken to raise the City of London in favour of the Duke of Monmouth. Also involved in the London plotting was Matthew Meade, who lingered in Essex. Then Nathaniel Hooke was sent to London and Danvers, as Monmouth moved into Somerset. At first he said he would not take up arms till the duke was proclaimed king; and when Monmouth had been proclaimed, that republicans were absolved from all engagements to a leader who had broken faith. On 27 July 1687 a royal proclamation was issued commanding Danvers and others to appear before his majesty or to surrender themselves in twenty days. Danvers succeeded in escaping to the Dutch Republic, and died at Utrecht at the end of 1687. ==Works== Danvers wrote: *Certain Queries concerning Liberty of Conscience propounded to those Ministers (so called) of Leicestershire, when they first met to consult that representation ‚Ä¶ afterwards so publiquely fathered upon that country, London [27 March 1640]. *Theopolis, or the City of God, New Jerusalem, in opposition to the City of the Nations, Great Babylon, being a comment on Revelation, chs. xx. xxi.

Wills was answered by a group of leading Baptists in The Baptists Answer to Mr Obed. Wills (1675), by Thomas Delaune, Daniel Dyke, Henry Forty, John Gosnold, William Kiffin, and Hanserd Knollys.

This region was populated by Illyrians, respectively members of the Dardan tribe. The first data for the archaeological sites in the region of Mitrovica, begin with the researches of Sir Artur John Evans, who was the first to pinpoint the Roman town of the Municipium Dardanourm. In the archaeological sites of the region of Mitrovica were found traces and objects from different periods such as; Neolithic, Roman, late antiquity and medieval period. Objects and figurines include: fortress vestiges, necropolis, Terpsichore figure, statues, sarcophagus, altar, jewelry, etc. ==Settlements== See also: Archaeology of Kosovo Neolithic Period *Runik *Zhitkoc and Karaga√ß *Valla√ß *Fafos Roman Period *Rashan Fortress *Municipium Dardanorum *Pestova Late Antiquity and Medieval Period *Stroc Fortress *Duboc Frotress *Zve√ßan Fortress *Maletaj A Neolithic flute-like wind instrument named Runik Ocarina ===Runik=== Coordinates: Runik is a neolithic archaeological site situated 10 kilometers north-west of the Municipality of Skenderaj, in the Drenica valley. It is typical for the Starcevo Culture, sixth millennium AD, and it is one of the most developed civilizations of this time. The Runik Neolithic site and the archaeological findings in this area are considered as the most prominent sites discovered in Kosovo. First archaeological researches began in 1966-68 and in 1984, divided into 35 private parcels of the Dardania neighborhood of the Runik village. Fragments of pottery and vast movable material from Neolithic period recorded during these researches, evidence Starcevo and Vinca cultures. Advanced researches from 2010 included a wider are of this archaeological site, 1000 meters square. This open Neolithic settlement is characterized by huts build by tided wooden beam, without floor levels. The movable archaeological material is dominated by monochrome pottery with red gloss, ceramic pottery painted with geometric and linear motifs, barbotine decorated with impresso technique, anthropomorphic figurines, cult tables, and small altars. From the different dishes discovered in this settlement, the most interesting it is a baked clay vase dyed with ocher color, that is decorated in the shape of spiral with the motive of the palm of the hand painted by dark color. Another interesting artifact discovered in this settlement it is a Neolithic flute, that is a unique artifact not only for Kosovo, but for the wider region, too. It is a baked clay handcraft creation, it has a height of , with finger holes on the axles and a mouthpiece on the highest ax. It was given the name \\"Runik ocarina\\", and it releases sounds and warm vibrations and it is the earliest prehistorical musical instrument discovered in Kosovo.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide, Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.17-18 ===Zhitkoc and Karaga√ß=== Coordinates: The archaeological sites of Zhitkoc and Karaga√ß, are situated in the Municipality of Zve√ßan. Researches in these sites, respectively, Zhitkoc began in 1958, where several test excavations were carried out near the Ibar shore and resulted with discovering remains of a typical Neolithic settlement, of both, Starcevo and Vinca cultures. Researches in the archaeological site of Karaga√ß, were developed during the time frame of 1955 and 1960, the results evidenced a settlement established on the major part consisted by half earth grounded ellipsoid huts protected with ditches. Inside the dwellings were discovered a considerable amount of Starcevo culture pottery production. Karaga√ß settlement continued to exist in a later phase, respectively, Vinca culture, whereas;based on the discovered fragments of ceramic and anthropomorphic figurines, and huts that were constructed with intertwined timber beams coated with earth/mud. In this site were discovered also remains and traces of a settlement and cemetery of Bronze and Iron Age, illustrating the life continuation from prehistoric period.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide, Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.20 ===Valla√ß=== Coordinates: The village of Valla√ß is situated north of Zhitkoc-Karaga√ß, in close vicinity of the Ibar river delta, set on the upraised terrace known as the Valla√ß rock, in the Municipality of Zve√ßan. This archaeological settlements was investigated during 1955 and 1957. Remains or dwellings of this settlement are mainly composed of the huts constructed by timber beams and protected ditches around circular dwellings. The most characteristic objects found in this site belong to the Late Neolithic Vinca Culture, and include considerable amount of the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines, modeled and carefully designed terracotta statues. Below the Neolithic layer of this settlement were discovered some peculiar features such as; fortified traverses that protected the entrance of this settlement, confirming the continuation of this site occupation during the Late Iron Age.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide, Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.21 ===Fafos=== Coordinates: The archaeological site of Fafos is situated within the industrial quarter of the FAFOS factory (phosphates productions), in the suburban area of the Municipality of Mitrovica. The researches in this settlement were developed during the time frame of 1955‚Äì1961. The researches confirmed the presence of two Neolithic settlements (Vinca culture), set apart from one another approximately 200 meters. In the earlier date settlement or Fafos I, were discovered dwellings of half buried shelter huts, whereas, in the later date settlement or Fafos II, were discovered house-huts aligned one aside the other. The unearthed remains of the huts were destroyed in an extensive fire. In both settlements were discovered different objects of everyday use, anthropomorphic figurines, rite vases, terracotta figurines etc.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide, Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.28-29 The objects discovered in Fafos I, include a figure of a squatting man, with hands resting on tightly drawn-up knees, a grotesque masked figurine with padded knickers and exposed belly, and altar table in form of an animal- masked woman holding a vessel decorated wuth meandering bands, and with bull shaped legs.

It is located in the village of Rashan, approximately 5 kilometers flight distance from the Municipality of Mitrovica. The fortress is built on top of a cliff 80‚Äì100 meters from the ground. It has a very favorable position, and together with the Zve√ßan Fortress they had their role on protecting the mining and mineral wealth of Bajgora Region. It has the shape of the number eight 170‚Äì200 meters on the north-south side, and 30‚Äì45 meters on the east-west side. The fortress is surrounded by three pairs of walls. The construction of walls is built with well-carved stones, some of the walls have binding material. The walls thickness is approximately 2 meters and the height 2‚Äì3 meters. The first pair of walls surrounds the center of the fortress about 300 meters, the second pair of walls surrounds it about 200‚Äì250 meters, and the third pair or the inner wall is closer to the center. The Rashan Fortress was protected by four watchtowers, one in the north, two in the west, and another one in the south- east side. The north tower is constructed with stones and binding material. It has the width of 2.50 x 3.80 meters, and the wall thickness of 1.8 meters. From this tower was controlled the road coming from Trep√ßa and the road coming exactly from Rashan north-east of the fortress. In the inner part of the tower, or known as King's Room (Albanian: Dhoma e mbretit) is derived a stair in the form of a guardrail to put things on it. The west side of Rashan Fortress had two watchtowers, and their role was protecting the inner road that led to the inner part of the fortress, by communicating with Cerrnusha and Koder villages located in front of the fortress. The east side watchtower communicated with the Moistir hill while the entire east side starting from the most northern point to the most southern was protected by the nature itself. Another tower of the Rashan Fortress is Donjon, it is located in the center of the castle and it is known as main tower. Based on the toponyms and microponomys around the Rashan village it is stated that this fortress was a branch of Dardan royal dynasty. ===Municipium Dardanorum=== Coordinates: Municipium DD Municipium DardanorumA.J Evans, Archaeologia XLIX, Westminster, 1885, Pg.56-57 or Municipium Dardanicum The Illyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, Pg. 258 is an archaeological site situated approximately in the north of Mitrovica, localized in the village of So√ßanica, Municipality of Leposavi√ß. First researches of this archaeological site began in 1956. The researches were organized by the Museum of Kosovo. After preliminary researches, that were done in 1959 too, began the first diggings in a part of this location. Further researches and diggings continued in the period of 1960‚Äì1965.Emil Cershkov, Romaket ne Kosove dhe Municipiumi D.D. te Socanica, 1973, Prishtine, Pg.86-87 During the researches were included all the parts of the city and two necropolis that were found so far. During 1956 researches, were discovered fragments of the constructive settlement, named \\"Trojan-grad\\" or \\"Anina\\" that later was verified that actually was part of the forum. Municipium Dardanorum archaeological site stretches approximately 30 hectares, where in the eastern part of this settlement were discovered a forum, horrea, urban basilica, features of the Roman bath, details of auxiliary objects, vessels made of ceramics, and the northern necropolis. The vessels made of ceramics such as plates and pots, have a very rough fracture, with the edges turned sideways. These vessels are decorated with simple waves of lines and fingerprints applied to the cutting bar.Emil Cershkov, Romaket ne Kosove dhe Municipiumi D.D. te Socanica, 1973, Prishtine, Pg.110 The discovered archaeological material and the overall results indicate that, Municipium Dardanorum, primarily existed as a prehistoric settlement, and during the period from the last decades of the 1st century, until the first part of the 4th century AD, continued to develop and become a typical ancient Roman town.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide, Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.61 ===Pestova=== Coordinates: Pestova village is situated 4 kilometers from the Municipality of Vushtrri. The first archaeological excavations started in 2005, since accidentally were discovered some wall contours during the work in the infrastructure. The archaeological findings resulted on partially unearthing remains of a building, and ruins of a villae rusticae. According to the Roman architecture, villas were complex built structures composed of several accompanied rooms, baths or termae and drinkable water deposits, whereas villas in the towns were known as villae urbana, and villas in the countryside were known as villae rusticae, and to the healthy people they served as places for relaxation. Pestova's villae rusticae most likely belonged to latifondist family, presumably to a very distinguished and rich Furi or Ponti family members from the ancient site of Ulpiana. Parts of villa complex usually are stables for the domestic animals, workshops and storehouses. When analyzing the ancient map Tabvla Imperii Romani, and the site setting of the Pestova villa, it can be argued that most likely, the ancient route that connected Ulpiana with the ancient town of the Municipium DD, passed close or nearby this interesting archaeological site.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide, Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.63 ===Stroc Fortress=== Coordinates: Stroc village is situated approximately 18 kilometers in the south of the Municipality of Vushtrri.Jusuf Osmani, Vendbanimet e Kosoves, Prishtine, 2005, p.211 It is known for the existence of a fortress set at the Gradina hill. Based on the construction material and exhibits found here it is a Dardani fortress which was used in continuity since prehistory, Late Antiquity and Early Medieval period. Based on the terrain configuration and evidenced remains, presumable at this location, in the past, a cult object used to exist and served to the local population.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide, Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.85 It has a very strategic position, lying on the valley of Sitnica river and Kosovo Valley. The archeological site of Stroc is divided into two parts, Gjytet and Prapshti. Based on the legends Gjyteti was the capital of Artakoll. The Stroc fortress or Gjyteti has two fortified pair of doors. In the top of the fortress are found ruins of a building 25x25 meters, with the walls width of 1,5 meters. Close to this building are some fortified towers.Emin Fejza, Zenun Gjocaj, Izet Miftari, Vushtrria me rrethine, Vushtrri, 2003, Pg.471 Based on the terrain configuration and evidenced remains, presumable at this location, in the past, a cult object used to exist and served to the local population. ===Duboc Fortress=== Coordinates: Duboc Fortress is situated above the Ce√ßan, part of the Ci√ßavica mountain chain, in the village of Duboc, approximately 10‚Äì12 km in the south-west of the Municipality of Vushtrri.Milot Berisha, Kosovo Archaeological Guide, Prishtin√´, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.87 It is a location of the dardanic cultural group of the 8th and 9th centuries AD Jusuf Osmani, Vendbanimet e Kosoves-Vushtrria, Prishtine, 2005, Pg.148 Based on the findings of the cultural layers in this location, the discovered archaeological exhibits show about two different civilizations. Civilization A is in the lower layers underneath the civilization B, and the civilization B is in the upper layers. Civilization B or the Duboc Fortress is located in the Mountain of the Town, (alb. \\"Mali i Gjytetit\\") from the north-east to the west. The length of the wall of the Duboc fortress is 900 meters, with the width of 2‚Äì4 meters, the height it is not known. The town of Duboc had two pairs of doors facing each other.Emin Fejza, Zenun Gjocaj, Izet Miftari, Vushtrria-Viciana me rrethine, Vushtrri,2003, Pg.470 In this fortress were found ceramics with ornaments of the illyrian ethnographic fond, bricks, and marble objects with inscriptions. From the paleolithic period there were found chisels made of pigs teeth. From the neolithic period were found different types of jewelry: earrings, and coins. Zveƒçan Fortress overview ===Zve√ßan Fortress=== Coordinates: Zvecan fortress is situated approximately 2 kilometers west of the Municipality of Mitrovica. It is located near the Trep√ßa mine, and together with Rashan Fortress they had their role on protecting the mines. First historical written documents about this fortress are by historian Ana Komnena, 1902, and it is classified as a Byzantine castle. Further archaeological researches reflected that Zvecan Fortress it belongs to the Late Antiquity, respectively 4th century AD. This settlement stands up on a volcanic craggy hill, and it is fortified with stone walls with lime plaster. Inside this archaeological site, respectively fortress are discovered remains of an administration building and a Paleochristian church, but the exact age of these remains it is not defined yet.

However, many decades before the creation of the city, Ferizaj was settled by the first family named Goga. Their houses were built in the village of Nikadin, which, before the construction of the railway, was unnamed. This family also lived in the region of Ferizaj when Elezit Khan existed. They began to work and to establish their households. Near their houses was a crossroad that linked all the roads of Kosovo. They became the most important family of that time. Members of this family are considered the first inhabitants and the creators of the city. It is thought that the Goga family originated from the area of northern Albania from the great highland in the village of Muraj. In those areas, the surname Goga is very common. Many families around the beginning of the 18th century moved to Kosovo to take advantage better living conditions. Members of Goga family brought their culture with them to Ferizaj. Their unique and rich spoken language originated in northern Albania. The chamber of Ismajl Goga is famous for its hospitality for friends, guests, and passersby. Some of the first leaders of the Goga family were: Bislim Goga II, Haxhi Kadri Goga III, and Ismajl Goga and his descendants Muharremi, Faiku, Samiu, Kadriu, Remziu, and Xhylizarja.Ferizaj 1873‚Äì1944/Ibrahim Hyseni (Goga) page 17,18; chapter II === Vata Families === Early residents of Ferizaj city also included the Vata family. Families lived quietly in the same place until the year 1912. Today a military barrack occupies the land. The Vata family mostly worked in agriculture and cultivated vegetables. The first leaders of Vata family were: Ali Vata, Avdi Vata, Bajram Vata, Beqir Vata, Fejz√´ Vata, Haki Vata, Halim Vata, Hetem Vata, Halim Vata, Ismajl Vata, Liman Vata, Mustaf√´ Vata, Muharrem Vata, Nazif Vata, Rizah Vata, Rifat Vata, Sylejman Vata, Shaban Vata, preacher, professor, teacher and one of the creators of the first Albanian school, called Ismajl Qemaili in Ferizaj (1914‚Äì1968).Ferizaj 1873‚Äì1944/Ibrahim Hyseni (Goga) page 41, 32; chapter III Familja Kurti, Ferizaj 1920 === Kurti Families === Other early residents of Ferizaj city were the Kurti Family. Around 1750, Kol√´ Kurti and his brothers (Seba, Andrea, and Toni) moved to Gjakova. Later Zef Kurti married Petra from Janjevo and moved to Ferizaj in 1878 during the time the railway was under construction. They were mainly tradesmen and hand-craftsmen. One of the Kurtis was Father Shtjef√´n KurtiShtjef√´n Kurti (1898‚Äì1971) who was a priest and a martyr. He was born and raised in Ferizaj and studied in Graz, Feldkirch, and Innsbruck in Austria as well as Rome, Italy. From 1936 he was the parish priest in Tirana where he was executed by the communist regime of that time. Gjon Serreqi is another member of the Kurti family who was the leader of Lidhja Nacionale Demoratike Shqip√´tare (the Albanian National Democratic Union or LNDSH). Gjon SerreqiAlbanian National Democratic Movement was a professor who was jailed for his political activity and sentenced to death by the regime of that time.

They give live performances every week. There are 21 well- known Kosovan actors employed. They are located in the heart of Pristina. National Theatre (Teatri Kombetar) is placed in the middle downtown of the city, near the main government building. ODA Theatre (Teatri ODA) is placed in the Youth Centre Building, and Dodona Theatre (Teatri Dodona) is placed in Vellusha district, which is near Ibrahim Rugova Square. ==National Theatre of Kosova== () ===History of the theatre=== National Theatre of Kosovo National Theater of Kosovo was founded in October, 1946 in Prizren. This was the first professional theatre in Kosovo after World War II. It was firstly named \\"The Regional Populist Theater\\" then the \\"Provincial Populist Theater\\" until 1999 when it was finally changed to \\"The National Theater of Kosovo\\". After a few months after the establishment, the theater was moved to Pristina, the capital city of Kosovo. The first performances of the theatre were mostly created by amateur artists and talented and enthusiastic idealists which were aided from professional artists from other theaters of ex-Yugoslavia. Until 1989 there were over 400 premiers with over 10,000 replays showed in the theatre which were followed by over 3.2 million spectators. The repertoire of this theater was built on texts of many national, global and former Yugoslavian dramatics. These theatre performances, which were presented in different festivals with national and international character in the former Yugoslavia, were praised highly by critics of the time and were honored with various artistic awards. In 1967, the play \\"Erveheja\\" of director Muharrem Qena was honored with the Award for the Best Drama in the Yugoslavian Drama Festival \\"Sterijino Pozorje\\". In addition to performances in the Albanian language, there were also performances in the Serbian language, especially after 1981 when the theater was operating under heavy politic pressure from the Yugoslavian communist regime. In 1990, the rigorous regime of Slobodan Milosevic placed the theatre under a violent administration by expelling the Albanian artists from the theater and putting it under totalitarian control. During this period, in a parallel university education system created against the totalitarian regime, many school-homes were created from the artistic ensemble, which were already part of this professional ensemble theatre. After the war in 1999, there have been numerous national and international plays in the theatre. The theatre is of a national character, as such, it is funded by the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports of the Republic of Kosovo. ===Plays=== * In 2008: ‚Äú √áifti Martin‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Martin couple‚Äù), ‚ÄúTartufi‚Äù(‚ÄúTartuf‚Äù), ‚ÄúMotra e kat√´rt‚Äù (‚ÄúThe fourth Sister‚Äù), ‚ÄúLiria po vjen‚Äù (‚ÄúFreedom is coming‚Äù). * In 2009: ‚ÄúDejzilend‚Äù (‚ÄúDaisyland‚Äù), ‚ÄúBodrumi‚Äù (‚ÄúThe basement‚Äù), ‚ÄúRebel√´t‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Rebels‚Äù), ‚ÄúMashtruesit‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Cheaters‚Äù), ‚ÄúVdekja dhe Vasha‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Death and the Girl‚Äù), ‚ÄúNorway,Today‚Äù. * In 2010: ‚ÄúPeer Gynt‚Äù, ‚ÄúHeshtja‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Silence‚Äù), ‚ÄúClooser‚Äù * In 2011: ‚ÄúFizikant√´t‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Physicants‚Äù), ‚ÄúUdh√´timi‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Roadtrip‚Äù), ‚Äù Nata e Helverit‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Helver Night‚Äù), ‚ÄúLeksioni I Yu-Mitologjis√´‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Lecture of Yu-Mythology‚Äù) * In 2012: ‚ÄúNora‚Äù (‚ÄúNora‚Äù), ‚ÄúLisistrata‚Äù, ‚ÄúDosja H‚Äù (‚ÄúThe file on H‚Äù), ‚ÄúSht√´pia n√´ ankand‚Äù (‚ÄúHouse in auction‚Äù). * In 2013: ‚ÄúD√´shmitari‚Äù (‚ÄúThe witness‚Äù), ‚ÄúP√´rplasjet‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Clash‚Äù), ‚ÄúMbas Zonjush√´s Julie‚Äù (‚ÄúAfter Miss Julies‚Äù), ‚ÄúNarnia‚Äù ===Notable people=== * Actors: Istref Begolli, Muharrem Qena, Syl√´ Ku√ßi, Drita Krasniqi, Selman Jusufi , Igballe Qena, Fatime Laj√ßi, Leze Qena, Fatime Lugiqi, Shirine Morina, Bislim Mu√ßaj, Hysnij√´ Mu√ßaj, Kumrije Hoxha, Mehmet Breznica, Ismet Azemi, Drita Begolli, Veton Osmani, Lumnije Mu√ßaj-Sopi, Xhejlane Godanci, Adhurim Demi, Basri Lushtaku, Naim Berisha, Fatmir Spahiu, Xhevat Qena, N√´ntor Fetiu, Dibran Tahiri, Adem Mikullovci, Luan Jaha, Lirak √áelaj * Author: Beqir Musliu * Directors: Fetah Mehmeti, Krist√´ Berisha, Fadil Hysaj, Isa Qosja, Besim Sahat√ßiu, Agim Sopi, Selami Taraku, Jeton Budima, Ilir Bokshi, Esat Brajshori, Atdhe Gashi. * Designer: Linda Polloshka, Violeta Xhaferi, Iliriana Loxha, Lumturije Gashi. ===Awards 1950‚Äì1979=== The first professional award took Shani Pallaska in \\"Personi i dyshimt√´\\"(\\"The suspicious person\\") of Nushiq,in the first professional festival of theatres in Serbia, held in Belgrade in 1950. * In December 1963 the Theatre was awarded with \\"Shp√´rblimi i Vukut\\"(\\"The Vuk Award\\") and \\"Shp√´rblimi i publikut(\\"The audience Award\\") for the culture development and artictic expression. * In 1969 in Udzice, the Albanian drama with ‚ÄúFosilet‚Äù(‚ÄúBones‚Äù) was awarded for the actor part.

At the beginning ODA Theatre did not have a permanent space for its activities, even the first theatrical project of this organization, ever the first premiere was practised without knowing where it will be shown. This premiere was shown in a borrowed space, which later that space was transformed and served as a residence of this theatre for a decade. The theatre building had initially been a bowling club and was transformed into a disco club later on and then into a black box-type theater with flexible usage for different set-ups, convenient for a range of events from smaller, more intimate ones to large events. In the absence of founds, even the founders worked hard without ‚Äòrespecting‚Äô the hierarchy who what function had. For the space of the theatre was worked systematically, depending on the budgetary possibilities. By 5 January 2004, ODA Theatre was officially opened with a cocktail party where, in this case, Pristina was made with a new performing scene, and ODA was promoted as a different theatre where on 7 January 2004 was written an article where it is said: It is never enough with theatres, Pristina is the capital city with less theatres in Europe. In period 2003-2011 ODA Theatre has produced 30 theatre productions of its own, several exhibitions, over 70 concerts and around 100 guest performances. The theatre has gained national and European credibility as a leader in the independent culture sector in Pristina. The first premiere of the ODA Theatre is ‚ÄúThe Vagina Monologues‚Äù by Eve Ensler. This text is based by the conversation of the author with one of her friends who is ashamed of her body. This conversation pushed the author to interview more than 200 women all around the world. This theatrical show created an initial strategy that the ODA theatre to start its producing with a theatrical show of this kind to cause a ‚Äúscandal‚Äù and to raise the interest of the public. {  -  Author:  Eve Ensler -  Director:  Ilir Bokshi and Florent Mehmeti -  Playing:  Igballe Qena, Arbnesha Grabovca-Nixha, Anisa Ismaili, Gresa Pallaska -  The set:  Arber Berisha -  Music:  Astrit Bokshi and Mjellma Pallaska -  Costumes:  Valbona Saliuka } ===Oda Hosts=== The purpose of Oda Theatre was to keep the door always open for other projects. This means that ODA gave chances to work with different companies from in and outside the country. This kind of relationship began from the beginning of ODA Theatre. Some of the collaborations were ‚ÄúGogoli‚Äù(\\"The boogeyman\\") written by Arianit Krasniqi, directed by Artur Tahiraj, ‚ÄúNjer√´zit e Rrug√´s‚Äù(\\"People of the streets\\") and ‚ÄúG√´njimi‚Äù(\\"Lying\\"). For several years now ODA hosted several festivals, among them are Pristina Jazz Festival, DAM Festival, Rock for Rock Festival, SKENA UP Students Theatre and Film Festival. ===Plays=== One of the most known and successful plays of ODA Theatre, which is still known is ‚ÄúTre Gj√´rmant e Trash√´‚Äù (The Three Fat Germans), show which was liked by the majority of public.

In the first four years of its existence it was under the direction of the Croatian playwright Borislav Mrkic. In 1992, the theatre moved to premises in Xhavit Mitrovica street, which gave it an opportunity to provide parallel performances: children plays in the afternoon and adult performances in the evening. In 1991 Dodona Theatre gained its first employees. The year 1994 was not so good for the Dodona Theatre. There came Radoslav Zlatanovic and all the documentaries were ruined and they stole technical things that were never found. From 1992 until the Serb takeover in 1998, it was under the direction of Enver Petrovci. During these years of work of theatre, a lot of sponsors and donations were given to theatre. The building of the theatre was reconstructed for the first time during 1986-1992, and for the second time during 2004-2006. In March 2011 according to the new status, this temple was transformed into the city theatre of Dodona. ===Plays=== One of the most successful plays of all time in Dodona is ‚ÄúPylli √´sht√´ i t√´ gjith√´ve‚Äù (Forest belongs to everybody). Until today there were shown 37 premieres and 2,784 replies, which were seen by 527,554 viewers.

Due to the overall increase in economic development, Gjilan has become a known administrative, commercial and industrial region. Territory of Gjilan's municipality currently has an area of 391 km with approximately 130,000 residents. The entire territory owns about 24,230 hectares of farmland, from which 18,224 hectares are considered to be agricultural land which produce a variety of traditional crops. Gjilan is well posiitoned geographically as an administrative unit. Automobile highways roads permit good communication and movement of goods and people, connecting with Prishtina, Vitia, Ferizaj, Kamenica, Bujanovac, and other centers of Kosovo. Thus, Gjilan was and is an important strategic center that has an economic impact to the region. Natural resources in the region have been exploited since the Middle Ages. Notable resources include potassium, magnesium, and the thermal mineral water, or hot springs. GJILANII == The historical development of Gjilan == Gjilani 1925 Historically, Gjilan‚Äôs economy was based mostly on agriculture. Land was worked with simple and primitive tools, producing low agriculture yield. Most production was for domestic consumption, not export. Regional agricultural output traditionally included: poultry, livestock, handicrafts, arboriculture, vegetable production. == Industry == After World War II, industrial development was initiated in the municipality. This was achieved in particular by raising tobacco combine. Favorable climatic conditions, soil solvency, commitment and massification of farmers, led to the development of this industrial branch. During 80 years in Combine tobacco are produced about 1,156 tons of fermented tobacco and cigarettes around 1,400 tons of various assortment of high quality. Alongside the development of the tobacco industry was also the textile industry, which Gjilan was recognized and affirmed in the domestic and external market. It can be said that through this industrial branch in Gjilan then identified as the industrial city. During the 1970s, industrial production was concentrated in the tobacco industry, textile, flour, in agro-industry, in the steelworks in the construction material industry, and radiators. After 1980 is also investing in a range of other branches of economic activity in which they were raised and developed other objects of industrial capacity. == Construction == Gjilan has a long tradition in construction, in 1980 employing over 2,000 people. This upward momentum in economic activity in the housing construction sector also extended throughout Kosovo and beyond, extending also to other Kosovo municipalities. A good road network provides good connections to Gjilan surrounding villages as well as other parts of Kosovo and the region. The construction of a ring road reduced traffic within the city. With - Project Mobility II is foreseen urban traffic organization of Gjilan. == Trade == Trade, even as branch of economics has a long tradition in Gjilan. Trade in this region increased after World War II. As a result of rapid development were created first commercial enterprises among which are mentioned company November 28, which had extended a network of shops in most localities in Anamorava and abroad. Within this sector is a well-established mall that was to be very important for the supply of goods to citizens. Private economy - potential economic development in general. In a free market economy, the private sector is an important components of economic development. in the Gjilan region, private sector development increased in the 1980s and 1990s, after liberation. In this period Gjilan businessmen began to invest in various industries. In this regard are set up several production companies as: Fluidi, Dea, Ola, RC cola etc.. Following is a list of other private sector manufacturing enterprises of the Gjilan economy by economic activity. Such as wood industry: Kosovo Mobileria, ‚ÄïDiellza, ‚ÄïFanton ‚ÄïNiti, ‚ÄïKulla, ‚ÄïG√´zimi, ‚ÄïBardhi, ‚ÄïP√´rparimi,‚ÄïVllaznimi, ‚ÄïNiki.

Banking system in the municipality of Gjilan is based on free market economy and private capital. Owners of private banks are mainly from abroad and they own about 96% stake, while 4% of the shares belong to the local capital. A few commercial banks began operating from the beginning: Kasabanka New Bank Of Kosovo, 1. NLB, 2.BpB Private Business Bank, 3.Commerce Bank, 4.MEB become Pro Credit Bank, 5.Raiffeisen Bank 6.National Commercial Bank, 7.TEB Bank, then microfinance institutions and insurance companies.

These companies have received their licenses from the BPK (Banking and Payment Authority of Kosovo) and operate under the rules in force. These insurance companies have their own products, which have defined and exercise their activities and operations. == Craftsmanship == Craftsmanship and its role in economy Generally viewed the craft activity appears to be ancient as human economic activity. This place usually exercised mainly in the urban centers. For Anamorava, craftsmanship has been developed mainly in cities, as in Gjilan, Preshevo and Bujanoc. Gjilan main space center of Anamorava and beyond, once represented a small town with all the characteristics of an oriental town. Obviously today in Gjilan main urban center of the area, craftsmanship it no longer has a role it had in past centuries, but transformed into similar activities of other nature, even today is shown its important role in the lives of residents, the relevant are. Now we give some brief information about the development of craftsmanship in Gjilan surroundings. From the very beginning there was little consideration given little written documents, but also memory, verbal confession respectively anthropology help in this regard. If we start from some old craft, that were once productive, give products as evidence of artifacts that are produced by the human hand. According to data for the years 1914-1928, the craftsmanship speak for many types of crafts, 1914 in Gjilan recorded three jewelry stores. In Gjilan even today there are many shops of jewelry. Currently operating 33 stores of gold and jeweler in Gjilan. == Agriculture == Bresalc Gjilan 5 Until 70 years, agriculture was severely underdeveloped in Gjilan. The land is mostly manual work and with primitive tools. Usage seeds for planting are traditional, qualitative and not productive, while extensive livestock breeds dominated and low productivity. In 70 years, agriculture marks are more intensive development. In this period, gains momentum social sector development in combines was organized in cooperatives and agricultural stations such as Station for the Advancement of Agriculture, Agricultural Combine, Agricultural Cooperatives, Tobacco Plant, City Butchery for small animals and thick, birds Incubator for opening capacity of 9 million birds a year, freezer for fruit trees, veterinarian service stations etc. All these agrarian subjects had employed around 4,000 permanent workers and about 10,000 seasonal workers. The entire agricultural production was well organized and had an export even in western countries. After the war farmers began work in very difficult conditions, without tools and without the machine working properly. In the meantime, the government was not properly consolidated. For central and local institutions did not have the budget nor the experience needed to face the challenges of the time, on one hand, while many foreign organizations who had come to offer help in the consolidation of Kosovo agriculture acted without any clear concept and did not yield the expected results, on the other hand, agriculture suffers stagnation fore. With the start of the privatization process, the majority of the mentioned agrarian undertakings changed their destination. Only two of them as plantations in Kravarica and poultry farm in Livoc village ‚Äì Konsoni maintain their subjectivity and revive their previous production. Konsoni abattoir opened for broilers with an annual capacity of 600,000 thousand kg of meat. This farm has 60 full-time employees and a certain number of seasonal worker with a bright development prospect. Two companies MOEA and Ask Food have raised capacity of orchards in area of about 200 hectares and have built processing capacities, investments these promising prospects. Ask Food has signed contracts for the export of its products to Germany, Albania etc. These two companies have approximately 150 regular employees and 200 seasonal workers. == Livestock == Stanishor The livestock sector includes: 14,000 head of cattle, 9,000 sheep, 4,000 goats, over 200,000 laying hens, broilers 150,000, 3,500 bees colonies, 4,500 pigs and 1,000 horses. Besides poultry farms, which had a purebred breeding other types of animals haven't given high yields in the production of meat, milk, wool and other products. Before the year 1995 in the municipality of Gjilan operated meat processing capacities, milk, wool, and incubators stations for birds, which have enabled a good agribusiness for farmers of this area. War took a heavy tool on the livestock sectors, where the entire livestock and machinery manufacturing units were completely destroyed. After liberation, some farmers recovered their farms, slowly increasing the number of heads of cows, calves, sheep, goats etc. The privatization process has also caused damage by converting agricultural land to commercial and residential properties. Plant productivity: high trees about 300 ha, 10 ha of soft fruit, 100 ha of commercial greenhouses, cereals white surface with 3500 ha, 2500 ha area with corn, other crops area with about 3500 ha. Number of farmers involved in agricultural activities, livestock is 150 orchards, 100 greenhouses, farm of dairy cows over 20 are four mini farms of dairy cows from 4 to 20 cows near 300, mini farms for obesity 6 calves, 80 sheep farms, 42 goat farms, beekeeping 100, 9 Farms chickens, farm birds for meat - 2 broilers, sports Farm 1, Vali ranch P√´rlepnice village.

Units butchers selling meat are 10 of them, four Association, which carry out activities in various sectors of the livestock but which are much less active. Farm infrastructure . - In general it is not good : - Farms did not respond technological standards, especially those of cows, calves and sheep and goats, - Lack of agricultural machinery for land preparation - are not regulated landfills for disposal of manure barn that will protect the environment, - A great part of them still do not use new techniques of food production capacity manufacturing capabilities local population are very small, among which: - Milk produced only 20% of the needs of the Municipality - Beef also about 20%- bird meat 25% - eggs somewhere around 80% - 15% Honey - With the tree about 20% - With vegetables about 25% - 30% With remarkable account cereals From these data show that the municipality of Gjilan for the fulfillment of food needs of its population is somewhere near the average of Kosovo . The rest of the food, 70-80%, is imported . == Natural Resources == Municipality of Gjilan has good nature resources as 3,000 ha meadows, pastures 4,000 ha, about 23.000Ha mountains and clean water, agricultural land also has some 10,500 ha of fodder for animals. == The role of Strategy in the Economy == The strategy develops economy. Supporting and based on the potential of human resources, economic, natural ones, financial surface and underground, which exist in the municipality of Gjilan is necessary and reasonable increase in policy activities in order to develop economy. Then to achieve the objectives, goals, mission and purposes for a more rapid development of the economy is necessary to draft Economic Development Strategy of the municipality for a specified period, by observing and analyzing the competitive factors that enrich this strategy. This opens strategy perspective, also is the basis for guiding the development of economic sectors and the economy in general. In aspect of overall economic development strategy mainly oriented and determined for a comprehensive development of the whole territory of the municipality of Gjilan, relying on its efficient governance, which will contribute much to be in service overall development. Currently, in function of development of the economy of the municipality of Gjilan operate various branches of the economy. Whereas, under of oriented investment strategy in the rapid development of these branches of the economy, such as: 1. Agriculture and its branches, 2. Advanced craftsmanship, 3. Industry and its branches - Mining and quarrying, underground resources - food industry - textile industry - wood industry, plastics, leather, paper, other - metal industry - chemical industry, 4. Construction, 5. Trade, 6. Tourism, 7. Financial services Banks, insurance companies, 8.

The facility is composed of three Arc Heaters: HEAT-H1, HEAT-H2, and Heat-H3 which can heat air up to 13,000 degrees Rankine through a controlled high voltage direct current electric arc discharge. The test unit is owned by the United States Air Force and operated by National Aerospace Solutions. == HEAT-H1 == The HEAT-H1 Test Unit is an advanced performance arc-heated facility providing high-pressure, high-enthalpy test conditions for qualification of thermal protection materials, nosetips, and electromagnetic apertures and structures for hypersonic missiles, space access systems, and re-entry vehicles. The test unit utilizes a segmented arc heater with 200 electrically isolated segments which form the heater plenum. The unique segmented construction, with the anode and cathode at opposite ends of the plenum, allows the arc to be held at a fixed length to optimize heater efficiency, total enthalpy at high pressure, and flow uniformity. Normal operating conditions for the heater are about 20,000 volts and 1,200 amps, providing heater chamber pressures up to 120 ATM at high stagnation enthalpies. The H1 test cell is equipped with a multiple-strut, programmable rotary model injection system capable of positioning one to seven test models sequentially into the test free jet for preset dwell times. Transient calibration probes of various configurations are available to define heat flux and pressure conditions inside the test jet. == HEAT-H2== The HEAT-H2 Test Unit is an arc-heated aerothermal tunnel providing high-enthalpy flow at high Mach numbers and dynamic pressures simulating hypersonic flight at pressure altitudes up to 120 atm. H2 utilitzes an N-4 Huels-type arc heater to generate high-temperature, high-pressure air for expansion through a hypersonic nozzle into the evacuated test cell. The combination of the arc heater driver, various nozzle/throat combinations, the evacuated test cell, and exhauster makes possible high-enthalpy flows at Mach numbers from 5 to 9. Direction and distribution of the injected air can be selected to optimize the enthalpy distribution across the flow to match specific test requirements. Run times of 20 minutes or longer are available in HEAT-H2 for selected operating conditions. == HEAT-H3== The HEAT-H3 Test Unit was developed to provide a large, high-pressure arc facility with sufficient size and performance for testing of full- and large-scale missile and re-entry samples and structures. H3 is a 12-module, 50-percent geometric scale-up of H1. The test unit is designated to operate at over twice the available power level and mass flow of H1, with operational pressure up to 150 atm. == See also == *Arnold Air Force Base ==References *Arnold Engineering Development Center (official) *Electric Arc Heater *NASA - Arc Jet Complex Category:Electric arcs ","title":"High-Enthalpy Arc Heated Facility"},{"id":"42091720","text":"Hardin Township is a township in Johnson County, Iowa, USA. ==History== Hardin Township was organized in 1858.

In this locality were found Vase, from ceramic pots, coins, jewellery, items of iron and other carbonaceous substances, but also the characteristic stone, believed to have moved from coastal areas to build the sarcophagus and other items objects of strong high.

Alternative formats are created to help people who are blind or visual impaired to gain assess to their personal and leisure information either by sight (large print), by ear (audio) or by touch (braille). == Audio == Audio information is beneficial for many people and can be used by anyone who owns a CD player, a DAISY player or a computer. Audio enables people who are blind or visual impaired to access information through hearing, in the sense that print readers would understand it. === Choosing audio === Different people are likely to have their own preferences about the way they access audio, depending on their experiences, how comfortable are they with technology, and the equipment they to access the audio content. === CD as a medium for accessing information === Interference- colors Compact Discs (CDs) were first produced in the 1980s to store and playback sound recordings exclusively, and became superior to cassette tapes (AC) offering better sound and size. Standard CDs have a diameter of 120 millimetres (4.7 in) and can hold up to 80 minutes of uncompressed audio (or 700 Megabytes of data). CDs offer some navigation from the beginning of one track to another, rather than having to fast forward or rewind and guess where the tracks started and finished.Cassette-tape 8192 Over time, CDs have progressed from being solely for music, to being a format for all kinds of data storage, such as text, images, photos and videos. Educators can use CDs to store educational materials including taped lectures, presentations, and handouts into one compact disc for the student to access on CD players or computers. == Braille == Braille is a tactile system of raised dots that enables people who are visual impaired or blind to access information by touch. The pattern of raised dots is arranged in cells of up to six dots, creating a total of 63 different combinations possible. Each cell represents an alphabet letter, numeral or punctuation mark. Some frequently used words and letter combinations also have their own single cell patterns. A person reading a braille book Braille can be the building block for language skills and a way to teach spelling, grammar, and punctuations to people with vision loss or who are deaf-blind. Not only do Braille codes represent alphabets, they also denote numbers, symbols, music and mathematical notations, enabling people to learn about different subjects in a different way from most of us. Braille books are available in all subject areas, ranging from modern fiction to mathematics, music and law. As with printed text, Braille makes it possible for people to access information in this format. == Electronic (e-text) == For many of us, having access to computer equipment and appropriate software makes written information accessible. Today‚Äôs technology allows people to do majority of their research online, share documents via email, and download lecture notes from school websites. With written text converted into a format that is readable on the computer, it can be accessed visually with screen magnification software, or through auditory means with text-to-speech technology. == Large print == Large print is essential for people who have visual or learning difficulties and have trouble reading fine print or deciphering crowded text at one time. Large print usually ranges from 16 to 22 point, while giant print uses fonts that are bigger than 24 point. Having one single size will not meet everyone‚Äôs needs; therefore, it is important to find out which is a comfortable reading size for each individual. Research has demonstrated the positive impacts of providing enlarged font size for people with mild to moderate visual impairments, resulting in an increased reading fluency and speed.

He is the lead singer, primary songwriter and founder of the British rock band Bastille. The band formed in 2010 and gained mass popularity in 2013 when the song \\"Pompeii\\" was released with their album Bad Blood.

At age fifteen, Smith started writing songs on the piano and his laptop in his bedroom, but kept his music secret from his friends and family until he was persuaded by a friend to enter the Leeds Bright Young Things competition in 2007, which he ultimately became a finalist in. His early recordings included \\"Alchemy\\", \\"Words Are Words\\", \\"Irreverence\\", and \\"Dictator\\". Smith did not achieve mainstream success in his solo career but continued writing songs both alone and with his close friend and roommate Ralph Pelleymounter of the band To Kill a King. The two formed a side project called \\"Annie Oakley Hanging\\" which was described as \\"cowboy- like\\" by Pelleymounter. After finishing his studies, Smith returned to London, where he continued pursuing his solo career, and eventually formed Bastille with Chris \\"Woody\\" Wood, Kyle Simmons, and Will Farquarson.Earmilk.com, Earmilk Interview: BASTILLE Bastille has released three albums called Bad Blood, Wild World and Doom Days, the latest of which was released June 14 2019.

In the same year, Smith co-wrote and provided vocals on \\"Better Love\\" with Foxes, which was released 4 September 2015. In 2017, he participated in the Grenfell Tower charity song, \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\". Smith was part of the music video for the Charli XCX single 'Boys' which was released on 26 July 2017. He featured in the December 2017 ITV programme of 'The Nation's Favourite' series which found out the nation's favourite Elton John song. At the 2019 Brit Awards, Smith performed a duet with American artist, Pink, of her song, \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\", as part of her medley performance. In November 2019, a cover of the REO Speedwagon song \\"Can't Fight This Feeling\\" sung by Smith was used in the John Lewis & Partners 2019 Christmas advert. ==Influences== Smith is a fan of the TV series Twin Peaks, and of one of its creators, David Lynch. The show inspired one of his first recorded songs, \\"Laura Palmer\\" and Bastille's first Virgin Records single \\"Overjoyed\\". Smith has said that his earlier work was influenced by Regina Spektor. ==Personal life== He writes and arranges some of Bastille's songs, apart from remixes and covers, and worked with friend Mark Crew to produce Bad Blood and Wild World. He plays the piano, keyboard, percussion, and melodica. His original, \\"Dan Smith Piano\\" was stolen in 2010. Smith's parents are South African. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Smith performed music live on Instagram, and also set up a film club named 'Distraction Tactics', inspired by different countries around the world; each week the club visits a different country and film. Its aim is provide distraction and happiness to those in need of some relief from social distancing and isolation. ==Songwriting credits== {  - ! Year !! Artist !! Album !! Song !!

For example, in 1900, from the 400 buildings Ferizaj had at that time 200 of them were stores.Komuna e Ferizajit - Drejtoria e Urbanizmit, Pron√´s, Kadastrit Gjeodezis√´ dhe Mbrojtjes s√´ Ambientit/Ferizaj Municipality - The Department of Urban Planning, Property, Cadastre, Geodesy and Environment Protection, Plani Zhvillimor Urban i Ferizajt 2008‚Äì2015+/Urban Development Plan of Ferizaj 2008‚Äì2015+, October 2009, Pg.9 The main craft activities were plis, filigree and shoe makers. One of the first businesses established in Ferizaj was a hotel, whose owner was Feriz Shasivari (from where the name descended). The symbol of Ferizaj - a waiter, demonstrates that the tertiary section of economy built the economic base of Ferizaj Many factories were built during the occupation of ex- Federation of Yugoslavia in Kosovo, causing rapid industry and economic development. Almost all the enterprises were established at the time of the Second World War (1941), from which only the brick factory is existent from that time. Before the last war in Kosovo that happened in the 90s, Ferizaj had well developed metal, wood processing, food, and construction industries; forestry and agriculture. The collapse of Kosovo's autonomy, followed by the application of violence and massive removal of Albanian workers from their places of work which had major negative consequences on Ferizaj's economy. After the Kosovo war, efforts were made to consolidate these enterprises revitalization and capacities, but the results were not very encouraging.Komuna e Ferizajit - Drejtoria e Urbanizmit, Pron√´s, Kadastrit Gjeodezis√´ dhe Mbrojtjes s√´ Ambientit/Ferizaj Municipality - The Department of Urban Planning, Property, Cadastre, Geodesy and Environment Protection, Plani Zhvillimor Urban i Ferizajt 2008‚Äì2015+/Urban Development Plan of Ferizaj 2008‚Äì2015+, October 2009, Pg.9 Nowadays, Ferizaj is converted into an important economic center.

The sector of agriculture of the Ferizaj's region (including: Ka√ßanik, ≈†trpce, Elez Han, ≈†timlje) has potential because of the large fund of fertile land, which has supplied many factories (such as oil factory). The quality of these agricultural lands guarantees favorable conditions for the production of agricultural goods (fruits, vegetables), which can be exported outside the city/state due to good geographical position. Agriculture is the main economic sector that provides the largest part of the revenues in the postwar period, because 2/3 of the population lives in the rural areas. Farmer's products in the private sector fulfill the needs of familiar consumption, therefore, there is nothing left for trade. Ferizaj owns 16,954 ha of agricultural land and 13,315 ha of forests, in total 30,269 ha. Grains are agricultural bases for the population, livestock and industrial processing. Earlier there were dozens hectares of trees plantation, but due to the activity of the anthropogenic factor, those hectares of soil were left behind. In the villages of Ferizaj are cultivated : wheat, corn, sunflower, soya, potatoes as described in the following table: Komuna e Ferizajit/Municipality of Ferizaj, Strategjia e zhvillimit ekonomik lokal 2005‚Äì2007/Strategy of local economic development 2005‚Äì2007, Ferizaj, March 2005, Pg.13 {  - !

After the war, Kosovo is facing radical changes to the economic system it has inherited, its transformation from a centralized economic system to an open market economy.Bashkim √áerkini, Master Degree Thesis, Academic Year 2011‚Äì2012, University of Business and Technology - UBT, Prishtina, May 2012, Pg.4 ===Vertisol=== This type of soil is formed in valleys (200‚Äì600 m elevation). Vertisols are present in all forms of relief but mainly in flat lake terraces under semi-arid climate.

It is located in Emin Gjiku Complex, a monument of culture from the 18th century. This house was once owned by the family of Emin Gjikolli. Emin Gjikolli nickname means \\"little man\\", in Turkish \\"Emin√ßik\\", which the complex holds the name today. In the museum, tools and items related to lifestyle from the Ottoman Kosovo period are on display. In 2002, the Ethnological Museum opened its exhibition of a permanent nature, in which ancient clothing, tools, containers furniture and old weapons, etc., were presented. Until 1990, the Emin Gjiku Complex served as a nature museum and after the completion of internationally funded conservation works in 2003, it was turned into an ethnological museum housing a vast collection of traditional costumes as well as utensils, handcraft elements and other tools used in everyday life. The above-mentioned collection is sheltered in the two central buildings of the complex (the house and the guest house) situated at the inner court, while at the entrance court, the relocated building is rented under a special contract by the museum to a Contemporary Art Centre 'Stacion' and the stable, the object of this study is left unused to date, even though the constant promises by the director of the museum to turn it into a traditional food restaurant. ==Pottery== √áerep, an ancient pottery art, made by housewives for baking bread, it was used until the 20th century. Pottery was an early art practice in daily ancient Albanian Illyrian life. Archaeological history findings tell that this production of these goods for practical life service dates back to antiquity and this type of production made of clay lives together with the human being even today, although now only as decorative means. -Productions of pottery amongst ancient Illyrian found their usage in daily life basis. They were made in shapes of dishes for storage of food and drinks. It was a known art in Albanian ethnic area, this type of craftsmanship has been taught in generations, because the baked clay was used for producing a series of objects on preservation and cultivation of foods. The clay was also used of producing at all times dishes of different types, shapes and sizes adequate for the practical needs in service people. These pots were known as pitos, drinks, cereals and other foods were preserved. The small types of dishes served in the daily practice for keeping fluid and except this other types of dishes and objects were produced serving for cult and decoration purposes. From the physiognomy and morphology of production, it must have been a craftsmanship almost professional with exception of producing tools for baking bread, known as √ßerep. Dishes and furniture from pottery have found their usage extensively in our people, in the village and city as well. This type of craftsmanship had been practiced a lot until around the 1970s. Pottery products now may be encountered only as illustration of passed era and just for curiosity and decoration. Now we may encounter rare masters of pottery, and be counted three or four. == Wood treasures == Albanian wooded ashtray. Our people are considered as one of the oldest peoples in the region of Balkans, and maybe even in the continent possessing quite a rich traditions, touching deeply in history regarding use of wood in practical life. Products made of wood in our people are of diverse types. In this aspect, we may assert that wood made products are mainly outlined from the complexity of working tools, furniture, decorations, household equipment for daily use. Almost from the earliest times, for wood products there are two types of craftsmen to be distinguished; the folk ones and the professional craftsmen. Both these categories of craftsmen used to produce in their from and manner, but we may state that the folk craftsman was more widely spread and would produce own products mainly for home use, whereas the professional craftsman usually would put his products into market; and that implies that it had the universal concept, more advanced and involving an artistic charm of his products.

As a politician Polak served at different times as a member of the municipal council of Rotterdam, alderman of the same city and Senate of the Netherlands between 1966 and 1985 for the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy. As a judge he served first in the kanton court of Rotterdam and later in the Council of State of the Netherlands. ==Career== Born in Rotterdam in 1928, Polak's father was a university professor of business administration and rector at the Netherlands School of Economics (later Erasmus University Rotterdam), his mother was a doctor. Minus Polak studied Dutch law at the University of Amsterdam until 1953. He then returned to Rotterdam to work as a lawyer. In 1966 he went into politics and stopped working as a lawyer. He was elected to the municipal council of Rotterdam and at the same time he was made alderman concerning infrastructure and public works. In 1974 he resigned his position as alderman after a conflict concerning funding for the airport of Zestienhoven. The municipal council held him responsible for the airport, but refused to provide him with the money to buy a firetruck. Polak felt that without the firetruck he could not provide the safety that was needed and therefore chose to resign. He did however continue on as a member of the municipal council for another two years. Shortly after resigning as alderman he took up the position of President of the Board of the Erasmus University Rotterdam, the same university his father was once rector of. Two years into his presidency he was elected to the Senate, and two weeks after becoming a member of that institution his membership of the municipal council of Rotterdam ended. Polak would serve for just over one year as senator, until September 1977. Earlier in 1977 his presidency of the board of the university ended and he took up his job as a lawyer once more. One year later, in 1978, he would also be elected to the municipal council of Rotterdam again. In 1983 Polak quit as a lawyer and became a judge in the kanton court of Rotterdam. In 1985 he ended both his function as a judge in the kanton court and as a member in the municipal council. He then became a member of the Council of State of the Netherlands, the highest court of the Netherlands regarding decisions taken by the executive government. Polak would serve between 1985 and 1995. Polak was made Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau on 27 November 1985. Near the end of his life Polak was nearly deaf.

A major redesign there led to the ES49B Kangaroo. ==Design and development== As the type number indicates, the ES-49 was designed by Edmund Schneider in 1949, though it did not fly until 1951. It is a tandem two seat training glider, rather like an enlarged Grunau Baby. After World War II the town of Grunau (Je≈º√≥w Sudecki) was part of Poland and Schneider no longer had his factory there. Instead, the ES-49 was built by Alexander Schleicher in Poppenhausen, at the foot of the famous gliding site of the Wasserkuppe. In 1950, Schneider and his family moved to Australia to build another series of gliders of his own design. The ES-49 is a wood framed high wing braced monoplane, covered with a mixture of plywood and fabric. It has a two part wing, built around a single box spar with ply skinning from it around the leading edge to form a torsion resisting D-box. Drag forces are taken by diagonal internal struts from the spar to the wing root, with the ply skin locally continuing aft to that strut. The rest of the wing is fabric covered, including the ailerons. In plan the wing has a rectangular centre section, occupying about 40% of the span and braced from below at about 25% of the overall span by airfoil section lift struts from the lower fuselage. Outboard, the wings are double straight tapered, with most of the sweep on the trailing edge, and end in blunt tips. Ailerons fill the whole trailing edge of these outer panels. Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are fitted immediately behind the spar near the outer ends of the centre section. The wing has 1.5¬∞ of dihedral. The fuselage of the ES-49 is a deep sided hexagon apart from the nose ahead of the cockpit, where an extra singly curved, horizontal panel is inserted for greater visibility. The aft seat is under the leading edge of the wing. Initially the ES-49 had separate, open cockpits but the first prototype later had a multi-panelled canopy enclosing the forward seat but not that of the instructor. The second prototype had a canopy which enclosed both occupants, an arrangement adopted by production aircraft which have tubular steel framed glazing, with a short, upward hinged section for the instructor who also has under wing side windows and an overhead transparency in the leading edge. The fuselage tapers to the rear, where the straight tapered, blunt tipped tailplane and elevators, covered with a mixture of ply and fabric, are mounted on top. A long trim tab fills the trailing edge of the starboard elevator. Since the elevator hinge is ahead of the fin, only a small cut-out for rudder movement is required. The fin is narrow and short, mounting a balanced rudder with a straight tapered trailing edge and rounded tip which reaches down to the keel. The second prototype had a shorter fuselage and so had a larger area, almost finless, double straight tapered rudder but the production ES-49s reverted to the first prototype's longer fuselage and smaller rudder. The ES-49 lands on a single semi-recessed, unbraked monowheel, assisted under the nose and cockpit by a sprung skid and by a smaller skid under the tail. After his move to Australia, Schneider designed a significantly different version of the ES-49, the longer span () ES-49B Kangaroo. The new wing, though similar in construction to the earlier one, was different in plan with a shorter rectangular centre section and proportionately longer tapered outer panels with shorter ailerons. This alteration placed the spoilers in the tapered sections. The fuselage was also revised, with rounded skinning on the upper nose instead of the earlier three flat panels, together with considerable revision of the rear fuselage. The upper fuselage profile was made straight and horizontal and the underside arched upwards, producing a more slender structure. There were detailed changes to the tail, too with a fuller and more curved rudder and the trim tab shortened and moved to the port side. Two Kangaroos were built, the second with slightly revised cockpit framing. ==Operational history== The ES-49 first flew in August 1951 and a second prototype was also built and tested before the production form with a long fuselage and canopy was reached with the third example. Only six ES-49s were built in Germany; clubs, the main customers for the relatively expensive two seaters, were looking for an aircraft capable of sustaining the rigours of beginners' handling and to easy to repair, making metal framed gliders more attractive. Schleichers therefore decided to concentrate their efforts on their Ka.4 Rh√∂nlerche, which flew for the first time in December 1953. In Australia Schneider sold plans for the ES-49 and three were built by clubs, under the name Wallaby. One of these was still flying in 2002. The Kangaroo first flew in February 1953. It appeared at pageants and was used for passenger pleasure flights, occasionally carrying two in the rear cockpit, before its sale to a farmer in New South Wales. The first leg of its delivery flight set a new Australian national distance record for a two seater of . The second Kangaroo was bought by the Dubbo gliding club in New South Wales the following year. ==Variants== ;ES-49 V.1: First prototype with open cockpits, first flown at the end of August 1951.

The squadron returned to combat operations consisting of sector searches, hunter-killer patrols and Dumbo missions in the vicinity of Ponape and Wake Islands. *May 1945: Squadron planes were equipped with expendable radio sonobuoys and the crews were trained in their use. *July 1951: The squadron was transferred to a new home base at NAS Bermuda under operational control of FAW-5. Intra-service training missions were conducted in cooperation with the USAF squadrons stationed at Bermuda. *1955: VP-49 provided support for the evaluation trials of the first nuclear submarine . *July‚ÄìSeptember 1957: VP-49 participated in evaluations using an LSD-type tender to support the operation the squadron's P5M aircraft. *October 1962: VP-49 participated in the quarantine of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The squadron joined several other regular and reserve patrol squadrons in surveillance flights over the approaches to Cuba during the period of quarantine from 15 October to 26 November 1962. *June 1963: A deployment to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base marked the last time the squadron operated as a seaplane squadron. From June to August 1963 the squadron turned in its SP-5B Marlin seaplanes in preparation for transition to a landplane squadron. *August 1963 ‚Äì February 1964: The squadron was transferred to NAS Patuxent River, Md. On 1 September 1963, NAS Patuxent River officially became the new home base for VP-49. However, the main body of the squadron remained at NAS Bermuda and only a detachment was maintained at NAS Patuxent River. The squadron detachment began transitioning from the SP-5B Marlin seaplane to the P-3A Orion. The main body of the squadron moved to NAS Patuxent River in February 1964. *1964: VP-49 joined VPs 8 and 44 in alternating convoy coverage from the East Coast of the U.S. to the coast of Spain in Operation Steel Pike I. It marked the first time that land-based escorts provided complete ASW coverage for a convoy transiting the Atlantic. *15‚Äì22 July 1966: A detachment of VP-49 aircraft deployed to Kindley Air Force Base, Bermuda, to provide air support for the Gemini 10 mission. *6‚Äì15 September 1966: Aircraft from VP-49 deployed to Kindley AFB, Bermuda, to provide air support for the Gemini 11 mission on 12 September. *27 May 1968: VP-49 began a split deployment with half of the squadron based at Naval Station Sangley Point, Philippines, and the other half at U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield, Thailand. The Philippine detachment was at Sangley Point when a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck the area. Personnel of the squadron volunteered hundreds of hours in support of the international relief efforts. The U-Tapao detachment flew missions for the Seventh Fleet in Operation Market Time surveillance operations in Vietnamese waters. *17 July 1970: VP-49 deployed to Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland, taking the P-3C on its first deployment. This model of the Orion featured the latest ASW warfare equipment including the AN/ASQ-114 computer system for navigation and sensor functions, the first of its kind in a maritime patrol aircraft. The P-3C had an AN/AQA-7 acoustic processing system with DIFAR, quadruple the number of directional sonobuoys, and a high capacity computer with related displays. *1 July 1971: VP-49 deployed to NAS Keflavik, for a five-month tour. The squadron earned a Navy Unit Commendation for operations in the North Atlantic during 14 to 25 September 1971. *1 October 1972: The squadron deployed to NAS Keflavik. In March, two aircraft were detached to Valkenburg Naval Air Base, Katwijk, Netherlands, to provide Dutch aircrews a firsthand look at the ASW capabilities of the Orion aircraft. *8 March 1975: The squadron deployed to Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, earning a Meritorious Unit Commendation during operations in the Mediterranean. *11‚Äì30 January 1976: VP-49 deployed a detachment to RAF Ascension Island. Surveillance flights over high-interest Soviet units off the west coast of Africa earned the squadron a Meritorious Unit Commendation. *27 July 1976: VP-49 deployed to NAS Keflavik, earning a Meritorious Unit Commendation for ASW surveillance operations against Soviet units in October. *2 November 1982: VP-49 deployed to NAS Sigonella, under the operational command of CTF 67. Detachments were sent during the deployment to Souda Bay, Crete, and Naval Station Rota, Spain. While on this deployment, the squadron earned the Navy Expeditionary Medal for missions off the coast of Lebanon during the 1982 Lebanon War. *July 1985: VP-49 deployed to NAS Sigonella. During the deployment, the squadron participated in the interception of the Achille Lauro hijackers. *July‚ÄìOctober 1986: The squadron traveled to South America to participate in Unitas XXVIII and Swampfox 86 exercises, operating with the navies and air forces of Peru, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil. *1 February 1990: VP-49 deployed to NAS Bermuda, with a detachment assigned to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, Puerto Rico. The detachment in the Caribbean participated in Department of Defense surveillance missions with the U.S. Coast Guard to curtail drug running. The ‚ÄúWoodpecker Vice‚Äù crews made five successful intercepts totaling over $20 million in hashish and cocaine, one intercept alone included over $12 million in drugs aboard. The latter was the largest seizure to date. Both detachments deployed to NAS Keflavik in late April 1990. *1 May 1990: VP-49 deployed to NAS Keflavik, marking the first time a P-3C squadron equipped with the Update III package had conducted operations against the Soviet Northern Fleet. The aircraft had an entirely new underwater acoustic monitoring system, doubling the number of sonobuoys that could be monitored concurrently over earlier marks. IBM signal processors provided a four-fold gain in isolating sounds of submerged targets from ocean background noise. Improvements in avionics, computers (AN/AYA-8) and cooling systems were added, along with a retractable forward-looking infrared turret under the chin of the aircraft and Harpoon air-to-surface missile capability. *10 March 1993: VP-49 deployed to Keflavik under CTG 84.1. Duties included ASW NATO operations, joint training with the battle group, navigation training to the North Pole, and ice reconnaissance missions to Thule, Greenland. With the end of the Cold War, the squadron conducted historic visits to Poland and the former Soviet Republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. *25 September 1993: Upon return from Iceland, the squadron immediately commenced Haitian Assistance Group Operations. These patrol flights flown by the squadron were part of the efforts at enforcing the United Nation's blockade against the Haitian military coup. *1 March 1994: VP-49 was disestablished at NAS Jacksonville, Florida, after concluding more than 32 years and 214,000 hours of accident-free flying, a record in the patrol aviation community. ==Home port assignments== The squadron was assigned to these home ports, effective on the dates shown: *NAS Alameda, California 1 February 1944 *NAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii 10 July 1944 *NAAF Eniwetok 2 November 1944* *NAS Alameda, California January‚ÄìFebruary 1946 *NAS Norfolk, Virginia 9 April 1946 *NAS Pensacola, Florida 1 June 1949 *NAS Norfolk, 25 August 1949 *NAS Bermuda 5 July 1951 *NAS Patuxent River, Maryland 1 September 1963** *NAS Jacksonville, Florida 31 January 1972 * The squadron was moved to Iwo Jima during February to March 1945 and then returned to NAAF Eniwetok. ** The squadron's home port was officially changed on 1 September 1963 to NAS Patuxent River.

Top: Novo Brdo Fortress Centre up-left: Kosovo Parliament Building Centre up-right: Traditional Tower in Decan Center down-left: Ethnological Museum in Prishtina Center Down-right: National Museum of Kosovo Bottom: National Library of Kosovo The architecture of Kosovo dates back to the Neolithic period and includes the Copper, Bronze and Iron Ages, Antiquity and the Medieval period. It has been influenced by the presence of different civilizations and religions as evidenced by the structures which have survived to this day. Local builders have combined building techniques of conquering empires with the materials at hand and the existing conditions to develop their own varieties of dwellings. The monasteries and churches from the 14th century represent the Serbian Orthodox legacy. Architectural heritage from the Ottoman period includes mosques and hamams from the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. Other historical architectural structures of interest include kullas from the 18th and 19th centuries as well as a number of bridges, urban centers and fortresses. While some vernacular buildings are not considered important in their own right, taken together they are of considerable interest. During the 1999 conflict in Kosovo many buildings that represent this heritage were destroyed or damaged. In the Dukagjini region, at least 500 kullas were attacked, and most of them destroyed or otherwise damaged. During the 1990s and thereafter, thousands of illegal buildings have been built in Kosovo. Rexhep Luci, the urban planner of Pristina who started an initiative to face this problem was killed in September 2000. ==Antiquity== The basilica at Ulpiana Ancient Ulpiana was a settlement of religious and cultural importance in the Roman Empire, that was active from the 1st to 7th centuries. Destroyed in an earthquake in 518, the settlement was later rebuilt by the Emperor Justinian I. The city had a sustainable urban scheme typical of a Roman city in terms of street layout and water supply. It also had 3 meter thick city walls with watch towers and 5 meter wide castle gates. Apart from Ulpiana, another notable city from the Roman Period is the Municipium Dardanorum. Among the remaining sites from this city are the Forum (Roman), the Basilica, the temple and other buildings. In the geo-physical research made by an Albanian archaeologist and also foreigners, have been found out that there are more than 100 ha worth objects that Ulpiana lies in. On the north side of the city is the cemetery, where many objects have been found: The foundations of a Basilica (Paleolithic-Christian) of early Christianity build in the beginning of the 4th century by Emperor Justinian. Also found is the north entry of the city with its walls and a memorium, a room or a form of funeral. The ruins of a building with a beautiful mosaic are found in the south of the city. The research was mainly focused on the antic objects which have been found on the sides of the main road which connected the antic city with the region.Kosova Arkelogjike 1 The attention was given to the findings of the objects in the north entrance of the city. With the addition of the use of air photography and satellites in the past years archaeologists, with no costly digging, were able to find and describe lots of big antique buildings which included a public bathroom, the forum (administrative center of the city), a residency of the bishop in the era of the early Christianity, and a baptismal chapel.Archaeological Guide of Kosovo Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sport, Archaeological Institute of Kosovo, Pristina 2012 A monument dedicated to the Dardanian Empress is a site with notable architectural features from this era. ==Middle Ages== Buildings from the Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages, when Kosovo was under the reign of the Byzantine Empire include castles in Prizren, Veletin and Kasterc and Christian basilicas in Ulpiana, V√´rmic√´ and Harilaq. These and other building signify cultural and spiritual developments in this area. In the Middle Ages, there was a simultaneous presence of Byzantine, Catholic and Orthodox Monuments. ===Serbian period=== Visoki Deƒçani The Church of the monastery in De√ßan/Decani was built by a Franciscan Friar from Kotor called Vita (Vitus). The building is of the Romanesque and Gothic architectural styles. The style it was built in is influenced by Western tradition while the main dome of the church links it with Byzantine traditions. The external part of the church contains details made of marble of different colors decorated with sculpture, while the interior part contains Byzantine frescoes. Most of the original marble furniture is still in the church which is uncommon for churches of this period from the Balkans. The church was founded by the Serbian king Stefan Deƒçanski (1321‚Äì31) and it was constructed as his mausoleum. ===Ottoman period=== Jashar Pasha Mosque is 16th-century mosque located in the historical center of Prishtina and it is one of the oldest buildings in Prishtina. The mosque has a prayer hall, a porch and a minaret and it is covered with a cupola. It is an architectural monument of Kosovan style with oriental influences. The Fortress of Prizren is located in the city of Prizren. The first mention of it is from the 6th century AD and the last time it was used for non-recreational purposes was in 1912. The fortress has seen a number of civilizations and constructions in the castle have happened in different historical periods. The remains of the fortress are of point of interest from an architectural point of view. Although it is an important historical monument, archaeological excavations haven't been completed. File:Jashar Pasha mosque.jpgJashar Pasha mosque File:Kaljaja1.jpgMain gate of the Prizren Fortress ==Yugoslav period== The Monument of Brotherhood and Unity in Pristina's centre In 1950, at the outset of Socialist Yugoslavia, the motto of the State as far as city planning was concerned was \\"Destroy the old, build the new\\". A 1959 book by the Municipal National Council of Prishtina called \\"Prishtina\\" shows the intentions of the regime at the time to lose the city's previous characteristics in the quest to give it more modern traits. The book boasts about 2200 newly built apartments, a number of health facilities, administrative buildings and schools, 130.000 square meters of new roads and pavements. According to this book, the new look of Prishtina was to be built on the ruins of the old city. New memorials were being erected and special care was being given to set new aesthetic foundations on the city. Immediately following the Second World War, Yugoslavia's brief association with the Eastern Bloc ushered in a short period of socialist realism. Centralization within the communist model led to the abolition of private architectural practices and the state control of the profession. During this period, the governing Communist Party condemned modernism as \\"bourgeois formalism,\\" a move that caused friction among the nation's pre-war modernist architectural elite. Socialist realist architecture in Yugoslavia came to an abrupt end with Josip Broz Tito's 1948 split with Stalin. In the following years the nation turned increasingly to the West, returning to the modernism that had characterized pre-war Yugoslav architecture. During this era, modernist architecture came to symbolize the nation's break from the USSR (a notion that later diminished with growing acceptability of modernism in the Eastern Bloc). The Yugoslav break from Soviet socialist realism combined with efforts to commemorate World War II, which together led to the creation of an immense quantity of abstract sculptural war memorials, known today as spomenik including the Monument of Brotherhood and Unity in Pristina's centre. In the late 1950s and early 1960s Brutalism began to garner a following within Yugoslavia, particularly among younger architects, a trend possibly influenced by the 1959 disbandment of the Congr√®s Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne. With 1950s decentralization and liberalization policies in SFR Yugoslavia, architecture became increasingly fractured along ethnic lines. Architects increasingly focused on building with reference to the architectural heritage of their individual socialist republics in the form of critical regionalism. The Hotel Union building is located in the center of Pristina. It is a three-storey, L-shaped building of Austro-Hungarian architectural style with a surface of 500 square meters on the ground. It was designed by an Austrian architect and built in 1927 when it was used as a hotel. Because it is a distinguished example of that particular architectural style in Kosovo it was declared a protected cultural monument 1996. On August 22, 2009 the building caught on fire and sustained major damages. The building and the surrounding area went through a restoration Arassociati studio that made it functional again. Now it is operated by The United Colors of Benetton and is called Benetton Megastore in Pristina. The store was opened on September 9, 2013. The roof has remained its original form while the entrance has been given a new urban layout. The Palace of Youth and Sport, commonly called Boro-Ramizi, was built in 1977 with a surface of and was intended to be used for social, public, cultural and sport activities. The building caught fire in February 2000 due to an electrical malfunction. Now only the shopping center part of the building is functional.

There are different groupings that either support the demolition, the completion or the conversion of the building to a museum. Some Albanians support its demolition or conversion, the reason being that it was built for political and not religious reasons but there are others that support its completion. According to Albanian Architect Eduard Morina who supports demolishing the Cathedral or repurposing it, the Cathedral \\"... doesn‚Äôt have any architectural values and is not among [listed] cultural heritage objects since it is not an old building\\" he continues. Archimandrite Sava Janjic, of the Visoki Decani monastery, on the other hand, strongly support making it functional. According to him, the Cathedral is of architectural significance and \\"... it is a very interesting mixture of traditional and modern architecture, that shows that one must respect tradition, but also look into the future.\\" After the war in Kosovo, the Cathedral was bombed and structural damage was caused to it In the aftermath of the war the church was bombed by unknown attackers and put under the protection of NATO peacekeepers for some years. Mother Teresa Cathedral ===Cathedral of Saint Mother Teresa in Pristina=== The initiators of the project for building the Roman Catholic Cathedral in Pristina are Ibrahim Rugova and Mark Sopi, who set the cornerstone for the building on June 26, 2005. Construction began on September 5, 2007 and it was formally opened by president Fatmir Sejdiu on September 5, 2000. Its architectural style belongs to the neo-renaissance Italian style from the 16th century and it was designed by the Architectural Association of Rome. The Cathedral has a 70 meter high tower. File:Kosova Government Building (1).jpgKosovo Government building File:Prishtina International Airport \\"Adem Jashari\\" Limak Kosovo.jpgPrishtina International Airport \\"Adem Jashari\\" ==Vernacular architectureKulla=== The type of building called kulla is a fortified residential building built in Kosovo, mainly in the Dukagjini region. The Albanian word kulla means \\"tower\\" in English. This is a type of building that was initially built from wood and stone and eventually only from stone. This type of building is typical for the Kosovan School of National Albanian Building and they have been built exclusively by the Albanian population in Kosovo. They are also the only buildings in Kosovo that haven't been influenced by foreign styles. Kullas are heavily fortified buildings with small windows and shooting holes, because their main purpose was to offer security in a fighting situation. The first kullas that were built are from the 17th century, a time when there was continuous fighting in the Dukagjini region, although most of the ones that still remain are from the 18th or 19th century. They are almost always built within a complex of buildings with various functions but kullas in towns exist mostly as standalone structures. They are also positioned within the complex of buildings that they exist in a way that makes it possible for the inhabitants to survey the surrounding area. Kullas in towns are usually built as standalone structures, while in villages they are more commonly found as a part of a larger ensemble of kullas and stone houses, usually grouped based on the family clan they belonged to. Most kullas are three-storey buildings. A characteristic unit of its architectural structure in \\"Oda e burrave\\" (Chamber of Men or Gathering Room of Men) which was usually placed in the second floor of the Kulla, called Divanhane, while the ground floor served as a barn for cattle and the first floor was where the family quarters were located. The material from which the Divanhane is constructed, either wood or stone, is sometimes used to classify Kullas.

The architecture of the city consists of buildings, structures and constructions which were built with an architectural influence of the Byzantine architecture, Serbo-Byzantine architecture, Ottoman architecture, Stalinist architecture (former Yugoslavia), and Modern cultures/architectures. Because of this there are many churches, mosques, buildings which are attraction points in the city and were built by the aforementioned influences. The foreign rule of the Ottoman and Serbian empires and the historical influence of former Yugoslavia (communist era) have shaped the architectural landscape of the city to become a conglomerate of cultures. ==See also== *Archaeology of Kosovo *Cultural heritage of Kosovo *Islamic monuments in Kosovo *Medieval Monuments in Kosovo *Monuments of Kosovo *Destruction of Albanian heritage in Kosovo *Destruction of Serbian heritage in Kosovo ==Annotations References  *Opening of cathedral in Kosovo Category:Kosovan art Category:Architecture Category:Monuments and memorials in Kosovo ","title":"Architecture of Kosovo"},{"id":"42092133","text":"Tiarn Powell (born 4 February 1991) is an Australian football (soccer) player, who last played for Adelaide United in the Australian W-League.Adelaide United profile ==References== Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Australian women's soccer players Category:Adelaide United FC (W-League) players Category:W-League (Australia) players Category:Women's association football forwards ","title":"Tiarn Powell"},{"id":"42092137","text":"King's Pier as it remains today. King's Pier is a 17th-century stone shipping quay, located on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England; part of the Jurassic Coast. It is found at the boundary point of the land owned by Portland Port Ltd, on the east side of the island within the area of East Weares. To the north of the pier is Balaclava Bay, whilst further south along the coastline are the remains of Folly Pier and Folly Pier Waterworks, East Weare Rifle Range, the two Salt Pans, Little Beach and Durdle Pier respectively.

King's Pier in the foreground, with the outer arm of the breakwater in the distance. The pier was first recorded on a 1710 map, although historical documents date King's Pier to 1622 for the shipment of stone to Whitehall in London. Work originally started in 1619, and cost ¬£700. British architect Inigo Jones chose Portland Stone for the rebuilding of the Banqueting House at Whitehall, London, in 1619, and from then on the island's stone became increasingly popular. King's Pier became one of the main stone shipping places on the east side. The limestone quarries of East and Penn's Weares were the location of Sir Christopher Wren's first workings of stone to rebuild London after the Great Fire of 1666. The stone was shipped from the adjacent Durdle, Folly, and King's Piers. The stone for St. Paul's Cathedral came from the East and Penn's Weares quarries, and the majority of it was shipped from King's Pier. Once quarrying in the area was reduced, and quarries moved inland from the cliffs, the pier fell out of use, and any cranes were removed.http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archiveDS/archiveDownload?t=arch-804-1/dissemination/pdf/Isle_Of_Portland_Industrial_Archaeology_Survey_Report.pdf The remnants of the pier ended up being used as the boundary of the naval base.

From 2007 to 2011, Miller was the chairman of the Fort Bend County Republican Party. ==Background== Miller graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in 1968. Miller subsequently received a Master of Science degree in National Resource Strategy from the National Defense University (NDU) at Fort Lesley McNair in Washington, D.C. He studied in the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, a division of the NDU. Miller participated in the United States baseball exhibition team as a pitcher at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. Thereafter, he entered Navy flight training in Pensacola, Florida. Following his training he flew LTV A-7 Corsair jets while embarked on the USS Independence. Advancing to the rank of captain, Miller held leadership positions on carrier-based squadrons and at The Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, where he worked on the staffs of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the United States Secretary of the Navy. Miller was the Senior Fellow of the Strategic Studies Group of the Chief of Naval Operations. In this capacity, he was assigned to formulate future concepts of war for the 21st century Navy. Miller received a number of military awards: Defense Superior Service Medal; Meritorious Service Award (twice), and Navy Commendation Medal and Legion of Merit (three times each). After his military years, Miller was the vice president of administration with Integrated Electrical Services. He also founded and is the president of TrevanionGroup, LLC, a company which seeks to train leaders and to improve leadership skills. Miller has also lived in Dallas and Marietta, Georgia. He moved to Sugar Land in 1999, where he is a board member of Rotary International and heads the finance committee of the Sugar Creek Baptist Church, a congregation of the Southern Baptist Convention. He and his late wife, the former Barbara Nesbitt (1947-2016), have two children and a third who is deceased. ==Political life== In 2012, Republican state Representative Charles F. Howard, who was first elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 1994, chose not to seek reelection to a tenth term for District 26 as he faced a primary challenge from two-term Sugar Land City Councilwoman Jacquie Chaumette, an African American of Caribbean ancestry who was viewed as a rising star in local politics. The race also featured Fort Bend Independent School District trustee Sonal Subodhkumar Bhuchar and realtor and local activist Diana Miller (no relation). Redistricting was a contentious issue in this race, as Chaumette had allegedly been drawn out of the district, and District 26 was one of several state house districts targeted in a redistricting lawsuit alleging that minority voting power (in the case of HD26, its Asian population of more than 30 percent) was being diluted to benefit Republicans. At one point, a state district judge in San Antonio nearly turned HD26 into a swing district with several key upper-class Republican precincts, including the planned communities of Sugar Creek, Greatwood and Pecan Grove, removed and replaced with heavily Democratic Mission Bend. Ultimately, the courts decided to clear an interim map with HD26 remaining heavily Republican. In the primary election for the seat on May 29, buoyed with the endorsement of Charlie Howard and social conservatives, Miller finished first in the field with 5,997 votes (40.8 percent) and went into a runoff election with second-place finisher Chaumette, who polled 3,949 ballots (26.9 percent) and earned support from the party's business wing and most Sugar Land-area elected officials. More than a third of the remaining vote was held by Bhuchar, with 3,043 (20.7 percent) and Diana Miller, who finished fourth with 1,696 votes (11.5 percent). In the July 31st runoff, Rick Miller defeated Chaumette, 6,851 (57.8 percent) to 5,000 (42.2 percent). In the general election, Miller defeated Democratic attorney Vy Nguyen with 38,541 votes (63 percent) to Nguyen's 22,662 (37 percent), who supported restoring state funding to Planned Parenthood. In his general election campaign, Miller urged supporters to vote not only for himself but for the straight Republican ticket. Miller serves as a member of the House Appropriations Committee and Public Health Committee. In the 83rd Legislative Session, Miller served as a member of the House committees on (1) Elections and (2) Defense and Veterans Affairs. In the 2013 legislative session, Representative Miller supported a ban on abortion after twenty weeks of gestation; the bill passed the House, 96‚Äì49. He co-sponsored with his District 24 colleague, Greg Bonnen of Friendswood, legislation to increase medical and licensing requirements of abortion providers. Texas Right to Life rated him 78 percent in 2013. Miller voted against a taxpayer-funded breakfast program for public schools; the measure passed the House, 73‚Äì58. He co-sponsored legislation to provide marshals for school security as a separate category of law enforcement officials. He voted against the bill requiring the immunization of minors without parental consent, a measure which the House nevertheless approved, 71‚Äì61. He voted against an equal pay for women measure, which passed the House, 78‚Äì61. Miller co-sponsored the bill to extend the franchise tax exemption to certain businesses. Miller voted to prohibit texting while driving. He voted to require testing for narcotics of those receiving unemployment compensation. He co-sponsored two pieces of legislation to forbid the state from enforcing federal regulations of firearms and to allow college and university officials to carry concealed weapons in the name of campus security. He co-sponsored another bill to reduce the time required for an individual to procure training to obtain a concealed handgun license; the measure cleared the House, 116‚Äì30. He voted for the redistricting bills for the state House, the Texas Senate, and the United States House of Representatives. He opposed a bill establishing term limits for certain state officials; the resolution failed on the House floor. In 2013, Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, managed in Texas by Cathie Adams, a former state chairman of the Texas Republican Party, rated Miller 88 percent favorable. The Young Conservatives of Texas scored him 65 percent. Miller was ranked 71 percent by the Texas League of Conservation Voters. Another interest group, Texans for Fiscal Responsibility, founded by Michael Quinn Sullivan, rated him 77 percent. The Texas Association of Business scored him at 87 percent. Miller won his third term in the state House in the general election held on November 8, 2016. With 39,693 votes (57.9 percent), he defeated Democrat L. \\"Sarah\\" DeMerchant, who drew 28,910 ballots (42.1 percent). Miller won a fourth term in the state House in the general election held on November 6, 2018. With 34,432 votes (52.5 percent), he again defeated Democrat L. Sarah Demerchant, who this time ran stronger with 31,177 votes (47.5 percent). ==References * Campaign website * State legislative page * Rick Miller at the Texas Tribune Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Texas Republicans Category:People from Fairfax County, Virginia Category:People from Marietta, Georgia Category:Politicians from Dallas Category:People from Sugar Land, Texas Category:United States Military Academy alumni Category:National Defense University alumni Category:United States Navy officers Category:Recipients of the Legion of Merit Category:Recipients of the Defense Superior Service Medal Category:Businesspeople from Dallas Category:Baptists from Texas Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Baptists from Virginia ","title":"Rick Miller (Texas politician)"},{"id":"42092192","text":"Chesterton is a disused train station in Chesterton, Indiana. The current depot replaced a wooden structure built in 1852 for the Northern Indiana and Chicago Railroad, a predecessor road of the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, that burned down in 1913. It was rebuilt in 1914 as a brick structure. By 1914, Cornelius Vanderbilt of the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad held a majority interest in the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway. The Southern Railways trackage provided an ideal extension of the New York Central from Buffalo to Chicago. On December 22, 1914, the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad merged with the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway to form a new New York Central Railroad. The New York Central Railroad, built the new Chesterton Depot out of brick and to the west, across Fourth Street, they built a freight house that same year. In 1968, the New York Central merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad. In 1976, the Penn Central's freight service was consolidated into Conrail and it ended passenger service altogether. Passenger service to Chesterton ended in 1959. The rail lines are currently operated by Norfolk Southern. ==Architecture== The Passenger Depot is identified in the National Register as Bungalow/American Craftsman style, whereas the Indiana State Historic Office (SHP) and Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana identify the structure as Spanish Eclectic The Porter County Interim report also identifies the construction date as 1924. This contradiction with the National Register information may reflect a building upgrade in 1924. The adjacent freight house retains the bungalow/American Craftsman styling, which may be the original (pre-1921) style of the passenger depot. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. According to the Indiana Office of Historic Preservation, attributes of the bungalow/American Craftsmap style are simple form, usually low side gable roof, large porch, heavy brick piers or square tapered wood posts, overhanging eaves with simple knee braces, low pitched roof, natural materials, wood siding, brick, stucco, cobblestone. Attributes of Spanish Eclectic style are clay tile roofs, little or no overhanging eaves, stucco walls, arches, especially above doors, porch entries or primary windows, elaborate entryways, decorative ironwork.

Some police officials interviewed after Jimenez's book's publication disputed certain claims made in the book. Dave O'Malley, the Laramie police commander over the investigations division at the time of Shepard's murder, said Jimenez's claim that Shepard was \\"a methamphetamine kingpin is almost humorous.

It is located within the field of vision of the Kepler spacecraft, the satellite that NASA's Kepler Mission used to detect planets that may be transiting their stars. The star hosts three confirmed planets, including the lowest-mass planet with a measured mass and size discovered to date, Kepler-138b, with a mass comparable to that of Mars. Kepler-138d is remarkable for being a gas dwarf despite being lighter than Earth. ==Nomenclature and history== Kepler Space Telescope search volume, in the context of the Milky Way Galaxy. Prior to Kepler observation, KOI-314 had the 2MASS catalogue number 2MASS J19213157+4317347. In the Kepler Input Catalog it has the designation of KIC 7603200, and when it was found to have transiting planet candidates it was given the Kepler object of interest number of KOI-314. Planetary candidates were detected around the star by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits pass in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth, although other phenomenon can also be responsible which is why the term planetary candidate is used. By timing these dips, gravitational interactions were detected between two of the candidates, allowing for a measurement of their masses and confirmation as real planets given that the masses were significantly below the deuterium burning limits. Following the acceptance of the discovery paper, the Kepler team provided an additional moniker for the system of \\"Kepler-138\\". However, the planets were discovered by scientists outside of the Kepler team and naming precedent belongs to the original discoverers (who refer to the star as KOI-314), unless the discoverers provide formal agreement for a change of name. Candidate planets that are associated with stars studied by the Kepler Mission are assigned the designations \\".01\\", \\".02\\", \\".03\\", etc. after the star's name, in the order of discovery. If planets candidates are detected simultaneously, then the ordering follows the order of orbital periods from shortest to longest. Following these rules, the first two candidate planets were detected simultaneously and assigned the names KOI-314.01 and KOI-314.02, with respective orbital periods of 13.8 and 23.1 days. Over a year later, a much smaller planet candidate was detected and assigned the name KOI-314.03, despite being the shortest orbital period planet (period of 10.3 days) found to date. Confirmed planets are conventionally assigned the designations b, c, d, etc. after the star's name. The labels are assigned alphabetically in the order of discovery starting from b. Since KOI-314.01 and KOI-314.02 were confirmed as planets simultaneously, the alphabetical names were assigned in order of orbital period by the discoverers, and thus became KOI-314b and KOI-314c respectively. Since no gravitational interactions were detected due to KOI-314.03, this planetary candidate remained unconfirmed as 6 January 2014 and thus kept the same name. In the following weeks, on 28 February 2014, a new paper validated KOI-314.03 as being a real planet with a false alarm probability of less than 1%. The new paper used different names for the planets, going from KOI-314b to Kepler-138c, KOI-314c to Kepler-138d and KOI-314.03 to Kepler-138b. Since KOI-314b and KOI-314c had been discovered in an earlier published article, naming precedent belongs to the original paper and thus KOI-314b and c cannot be renamed without formal agreement by the discoverers. However, KOI-314.03 was confirmed only in the later paper meaning this planet's name is given by the discoverers in the second paper, who use Kepler-138b. This has led to the unusual situation of having one star with two b planets in orbit and two different base-names for the orbiting planets. ==Stellar characteristics== Kepler-138 is a red dwarf with approximately 57% the mass of and 54% the radius of the Sun. It has a surface temperature of 3871 ¬± 58 K. In comparison, the Sun has a surface temperature of 5778 K. Kepler-138's apparent magnitude (bright it appears from Earth's perspective) is 12.925, too dim to be seen with the naked eye. ==Planetary system== All known planets transit the star; this means that all three planets' orbits appear to cross in front of their star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations relative to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by less than one degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Although the inner most planet has a size similar to Mars, Kepler-138c and d both have a radius of 1.2 Earth radii. All of the planets are too close to their star to be considered within the habitable zone. Although Kepler-138c and d have the same size, their masses and densities vary greatly. Of these two, the inner planet is consistent with a rocky super-Earth, whereas the outer planet's low density implies it may have a substantial proportion of water ice or a significant gas envelope, resembling a miniaturized gas giant (a Gas dwarf). The striking differences between these two planets have been hypothesized to be due photoevaporation. The KOI and Kepler letters for these planets don't match. KOI-314.01 and KOI-314.02 were confirmed by Kipping et al., but the Kepler team assigned the letters to Kepler-138c and Kepler-138d in their validation paper. ==See also== * Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler * List of multiplanetary systems ==ReferencesExternal links == *The Hunt for Exomoons with Kepler (HEK) project - HEK. *Kepler Mission ‚Äì NASA. *Kepler ‚Äì Discoveries ‚Äì Summary Table ‚Äì NASA. *Kepler ‚Äì Tally of Planets/interactive (2013) ‚Äì NYT. *Video (10:47) - David Kipping - Press Briefing on First Earth-Mass Transiting Planet, KOI-314c (01/06/2014).

Originally established as VP-917 on 18 July 1946, redesignated Medium Patrol Squadron (Landplane) VP-ML-67 on 15 November 1946, redesignated VP-892 in February 1950, redesignated VP-50 on 4 February 1953 and disestablished on 30 June 1992. ==Operational history== PBM-5S in April 1956 VP-50 SP-5B being lifted aboard , Cam Ranh Bay 1965 P-3A at NAS Moffett Field in 1970 *18 July 1946: VP-917 was established at NAS Sand Point, near Seattle. The squadron came under the operational control of FAW-14 and administrative control of the Naval Air Reserve Training Command (NARTC). The squadron was one of 21 naval reserve squadrons established after the war to accommodate the large number of aircrews recently released from active duty and utilize the enormous stocks of aircraft in the inventory. The squadron flew the PBY-5A/6A Catalina seaplane and the PV-2 Harpoon landplane. *15 November 1946: All patrol squadrons were redesignated. Regular Navy patrol squadron designations began with 1 and reserve patrol squadrons began with 5 or higher. VP-917 was redesignated VP- ML-67. The ML for reserve squadrons included twin-engine medium amphibious seaplanes, as well as twin-engine land-based bombers. Regular Navy patrol squadron ML designations were for twin-engine medium landbased bombers only. The amphibious medium seaplanes like the PBY-5A were in the AM category. *February 1950: VP-ML-67 was redesignated VP-892 during the reorganization of Naval Aviation Reserve units in 1949, but the change did not take effect until February 1950. During this period the number of Naval Aviation reserve squadrons was reduced from the 1949 total of 24 to 9. By this date the squadron had transitioned to the PBM-5 Mariner. *20 July 1950: VP-892 was called to active duty as a result of the Korean War. The squadron reported for duty to Commander Naval Air Force Pacific Fleet at NAS San Diego, Calif. At the start of hostilities the Navy patrol forces on active duty numbered just 20 squadrons, and it quickly became apparent that this meager figure was inadequate to meet the increased demands. By the end of 1950 seven reserve patrol squadrons were called to active duty to augment the active duty Navy patrol squadrons. The squadron reported aboard NAS San Diego on 4 August 1950 for training under FAW-14. *23 November 1950: VP-892 began its first deployment at Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan, reporting to Commander Fleet Air Japan and FAW-6 on 13 December 1950. During the deployment the squadron was involved in ASW, reconnaissance and weather information flights in the Sea of Japan and along the coasts of China and North Korea. The squadron‚Äôs first mission was flown on 18 December 1950, making it the first flown by any reserve squadron in the Korean War. *August 1951: VP-892 returned to NAS San Diego, Calif., to begin transitioning to the PBM-5S/S2 seaplane. The squadron became operational in January 1952. *12 February ‚Äì 1 March 1952: VP-892 deployed to Naval Station Sangley Point, Philippines, for duties under FAW-1. On 1 March 1952, the squadron began its second tour of operations in the Korean combat zone conducting patrols over the China coast and China Sea. *1 May‚Äì27 July 1953: VP-50 deployed to NAS Sangley Point, with patrol duties covering the South China Sea. On 1 June 1953, a detachment began operations at MCAS Iwakuni, flying patrols in the combat zone over the Korean coastline, Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan. On 30 June 1953, a squadron Mariner sank near Iwakuni while taxiing to test engines. No one was injured or lost, and boats from rescued the crew from the water. The tender later made several unsuccessful attempts to raise the sunken aircraft. On 17 July destroyed the sunken PBM with underwater demolition charges to eliminate any danger to vessels navigating in the area. The detachment rejoined the squadron at NAS Sangley Point on 27 July 1953. * 1953: While the detachment of VP-50 Squadron began operations at MCAS Iwakuni under the command of NAVY AIR WING SIX flying patrols in the COMBAT ZONE over the Korean coastline, Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan. During this operation VP-50 suffered 4 hostile attacks over the Yellow Sea near the coast of China and 1 PBM Mariner disappeared with a crew of 14, their fate unknown. *21 July 1953 PBM-5 Two Chinese MiGs damaged a US Navy PBM-5 Mariner- Yellow Sea. *2 October 1953 PBM-5 SE-3 BuNo 84713 - Hostile attack with damage- Yellow Sea *6 November 1953 PBM-5 SE-2 BuNo 84747 - Hostile attack - no damage- Yellow Sea *7 November 1953 People's Republic of China PLAAF pilot Xicai Lin claimed to have shot down a US Navy PBM-5A Mariner in Qingdao (Tsingtao, China). This might have been BuNo 58152, 10 MADNESS reported lost over the Yellow Sea on 10 November. *10 November 1953 PBM-5 SE-10 BuNo 85152 \\"Possible SOS sent\\" \\"Declared Missing\\"- Yellow Sea *10 November 1953 a PBM -5 Mariner BuNo BuNo 85152 call Sign 10 MADNESS disappeared while on patrol of the Yellow Sea with a crew of 14 who were listed as missing from an Operational Loss. In 2005, the crew of 10 MADNESS awarded the Navy Combat Action Ribbon, Purple Heart, Air Medal. The Republic of South Korea bestowed Presidential Unit Citations and Korean War Service Medals. This is the only hostile shoot down in VP-50 Squadron‚Äôs long history and the only PBM Mariner shot down during the Cold War. *18 November 1953 PBM-5 SE-2 BuNo 84747 - Hostile attack - no damage *31 August 1954: VP-50 deployed to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. The aircraft designated by the squadron as \\"Seven Madness\\" was forced down with a burning port engine while returning from a routine patrol in the Yellow Sea. It was ditched safely and the crew was rescued. However, the seaplane sank while under tow. *1 June 1956: VP-50 became the last active duty Navy patrol squadron to replace its PBM Mariners with the new P5M-2 Marlin seaplane. Upon completion of the transition, the squadron‚Äôs permanent home port was changed from NAS North Island, California, to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington. *25 September 1959: a United States Navy Martin P5M-2 Marlin (BuNo 135540, SG tailcode, '6', of VP-50) was patrolling out of NAS Whidbey Island when it was forced to ditch in the Pacific Ocean, about 100 miles west of the Washington-Oregon border.Maggelet, Michael H., and Oskins, James C., \\"Broken Arrow: The Declassified History of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Accidents\\", www.lulu.com, 2007, , page 128. A Mark 90 depth charge casing was lost and never recovered, but it was not fitted with an active warhead. The ten crew members were rescued by the US Coast Guard, after ten hours in a raft. The press was not notified at the time.Gibson, James N. Nuclear Weapons of the United States - An Illustrated History . Atglen, Pennsylvania.: Schiffer Publishing Ltd., 1996, Library of Congress card no. 96-67282, , Chapter 12, \\"Nuclear Anti-Submarine Weapons\\", page 214. *1 April 1960: VP-50 was given a new home port at MCAS Iwakuni, Japan, under the operational and administrative control of FAW-6. *1 October 1961: VPs 50, 4, 28 and 40 were assigned to Task Force 72, U.S. Taiwan Patrol Force, keeping watch over international waters bordering communist territory from Siberia to North Vietnam. This action was in response and result of the Berlin Crisis. Units of the Naval Air Reserve, including five patrol and 13 carrier antisubmarine squadrons were called to active duty. *30 June‚Äì6 August 1964: VP-50 received a permanent change of station relocating its home port from MCAS Iwakuni, Japan, to Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego. The squadron was the last of five overseas patrol squadrons to return to home ports in the continental U.S. The squadron‚Äôs 12 SP-5B Marlins were turned over to the Bureau of Weapons for storage at Iwakuni. Upon arrival at NAS North Island, VP-50 accepted 12 similar aircraft from VP-47, becoming fully operational on 6 August 1964. *26 August 1965: VP-50 deployed to NAS Sangley Point, with a detachment at Buckner Bay, Okinawa, and Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam. Tender support at Buckner Bay was provided by , and at Cam Ranh Bay by . The squadron flew 162 Operation Market Time missions and its aircraft were hit by ground fire on 10 occasions. *23 August 1966: VP-50 deployed to NAS Sangley Point with FAW-10. During the deployment a detachment operated out of Cam Ranh Bay, RVN, supported by the tender . On 6 January 1967, aircraft SG-13, while on a training flight, crashed in the South China Sea 20 miles west of Corregidor killing all 10 men aboard. Cause of the accident could not be determined. *1 July 1967: VP-50‚Äôs home port was changed from NAS North Island, to NAS Moffett Field, California. And the squadron began the transition from the P5M-2 Marlin seaplane to the P-3A Orion landplane. *6 November 1967, a SP-5B of VP-50 took off from San Diego Bay, being the last United States Navy seaplane flight. *1 May 1968: VP-50 deployed to NAS Sangley Point, with a detachment at NAF Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam. The squadron was the first P-3 Orion unit to operate from the Cam Ranh Bay facility and earned a Meritorious Unit Commendation for the performance of its duties during this period. *11 June‚ÄìAugust 1979: VP-50 deployed to NAF Kadena, Okinawa, relieving VP-47. During August, numerous missions were flown in support of the Vietnamese refugees, infrared turret under the chin and Harpoon air-to-surface missile capability. The squadron became fully operational with the new updates during its first ready alert on 1 March 1988. *17 April 1980: A squadron P-3C, BuNo. 158213, SG-03, crashed on Pago Pago. After dropping six paratroopers as part of a Samoan Flag Day celebration, the pilot purposely flew the aircraft underneath the well-briefed tramway cable despite being directly told the P-3 was not to be part of the air-show. The cable was too hard to see, the flight path was misjudged at speed, and the aircraft vertical tail was sheared completely off the aircraft before it banked and crashed as it rolled and dove into the parking lot of the Rainmaker Hotel. Six crewmen were killed in the mishap as well as one civilian on the ground at the hotel. It is a fact well documented in the accident report that the PIC Allen Glenny boasted of what he was going to do the night before the air-show for a hot-dogging display, and the crash was blamed on pilot error. The CO was subsequently relieved of his command after the results of the accident investigation. These crew members lost their lives: LT Allen R. Glenny, LTJG P. Conroy, AW1 Steve R. Buchanan, AMS1 N.L. Scates, AO1 J.H. Sharp and AT2 T.J. Delviscio. *10 December 1983: VP-50 deployed to NAF Misawa, Japan, with a detachment at Naval Air Facility Adak, Alaska, relieving VP-40. During the deployment the squadron conducted numerous peacetime aerial reconnaissance program flights monitoring the transit of Soviet military vessels. *1986: VP-50 upgraded its P-3C baseline with the P-3C MOD avionics package, including new acoustic processors, long- range navigation gear, secure communications enhancements and Harpoon missile capability. *3 January 1987: VP-50 deployed to NAF Kadena, with a detachment at Diego Garcia. On 10 January the Kadena detachment repositioned to Diego Garcia where operations were focused on the gulf, North Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. Detachments were established at intervals at Masirah Island, Oman. *22 June 1987: The squadron‚Äôs first P-3C MOD aircraft was accepted for P-3C Update III retrofit program. The aircraft had an entirely new underwater acoustic monitoring system, doubling the number of sonobuoys that could be monitored concurrently over earlier systems. IBM signal processors provided a fourfold gain in isolating sounds of submerged targets from ocean background noise. Improvements in avionics, computers (AN/AYA-8) and cooling systems were added. *6 February 1988: a P-3C was damaged during a touch-and-go landing in an area where the runway was under construction. The pilot was able to make a wheels- up landing with three engines at nearby Cecil Field with no injury to any of the five crew aboard. *4 August 1988: VP-50 deployed to NAF Misawa, Japan. During the deployment the squadron was able to conduct several Pony Express operations (missile shot surveillance) on the People's Republic of China. *1 November 1989: VP-50 deployed to NAS Cubi Point, Philippines, with a detachment at NAF Diego Garcia. In December 1989 Philippine insurgents attempted a coup. VP-50 flew battle group support missions to cut off the potential supply lines for the rebels. *21 March 1991: Two VP-50 Orions, P-3C, BuNos. 158930 and 159325, had a midair collision off the southern coast of California, killing all 27 aircrewmen aboard. The cause for the mishap could not be determined. *30 June 1992: VP-50 was disestablished at NAS Moffett Field, Calif. ==Home port assignments== The squadron was assigned to these home ports, effective on the dates shown: *NAS Sand Point, Washington 18 July 1946 *NAS San Diego/NAS North Island, California 4 August 1950 *NAS Whidbey Island, Washington 1 June 1956 *MCAS Iwakuni, Japan 1 April 1960 *NAS North Island, 30 June 1964 *NAS Moffett Field, California 1 July 1967 ==Aircraft Assignment== The squadron first received the following aircraft on the dates shown: *PBY-5A/6A July 1946 *PV-2 July 1946 *PBM-5 1949 *PBM-5S/S2 August 1951 *P5M-2 June 1956 *SP-5B December 1962 *P-3A July 1967 *P-3B 1970 *P-3C 1971 *P-3C MOD 1986 *P-3C UIIIR June 1987 ==See also== *History of the United States Navy *List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons *List of squadrons in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons *List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons *Maritime patrol aircraft ==References== Category:Patrol squadrons of the United States Navy Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons ","title":"VP-50"},{"id":"42092373","text":"Katrien Aerts (born 15 March 1976 in Geel) is a Belgian freestyle skiing athlete ==Events attended== In 2008 she finished fourth in the Open American Championship Slopestyle.

His father opened and operated a dental clinic in 1939 in Converse, Indiana. It is believed that Thad Miller spent most of his childhood in the Converse area. After graduation he lived in Mexico City, moving to New York City in 1956 to pursue acting. He studied drama at the Neighborhood Playhouse with Robert Duvall and studied at the Playhouse with teacher Sydney Pollack. His classmates included Suzanne Pleshette, Keir Dullea and Wayne Rogers.Haddad, Anne Marie, (April 15, 1984) Hungry days as actor are over for artist, Chronicle-Tribune, Marion, Indiana While living, studying and acting in New York City, he met and married New York-born Luba, nearly 20 years his senior. They briefly lived in Los Angeles until returning to Somerset, Indiana to explore art and farming. \\"I was an unemployed actor who'd married a business woman and I wanted to be a farmer and didn't know how to farm,\\" he told a reporter of the Chronicle- Tribune.Artist (Feb. 2, 1969) Chronicle-Tribune news article archives. === Somerset, Indiana === His painting years began in Somerset, Indiana after leaving New York City in 1958 and Los Angeles in 1959. Miller's work consisted mostly of portraits using friends and neighbors from the local farming community. He painted in the Flemish old-masters style with a touch of Salvador Dal√≠'s humor added. From 1965 to 1969 he sold more than 200 paintings, mostly to individuals and to fill the walls of five cafeterias, Laughner's owned by Indianapolis restaurateur, Chuck (Chip) Laughner. He quickly became known regionally, but later in life developed a wider following across the country and shipped paintings to Egypt and Australia. His works are now among art auctions across the country.Nangle, W. (Jan. 1, 1966). Somerset Painter Finds Inspiration in Studying Faces of Neighbors, Friends. Chronicle- Tribune news article archives. In 1974, soon after a fall from a window of his house, Miller was stricken with Nephritis, a kidney dysfunction. In January 1975, he went off dialysis after a successful kidney transplant.Glover, Victor (August 22, 1975), Alive and well in Somerset, Chronicle-Tribune, Marion, Indiana During the Somerset years, his work was exhibited in the Fort Wayne Museum of Art in Indiana and New York. == Works and auctions == Miller painted thousands of paintings in his lifetime. One of Miller's more well-known portraits depicts Jesus Christ as a black man. A number of Miller's paintings have appeared in various auctions, including his 1969 Psych Beatles, 72 inches by 47 inches, oil on Masonite or plywood depicting elements of The Beatles, Eric Clapton, and Janis Joplin. Some of his art, such as the Realist Horse, have been turned into Goodwill Industries and auctioned off by them.

It was the home ground of Crewe Alexandra, and also hosted an England home match, FA Cup semi-final and 1886-87 Welsh Cup final. ==History== The ground was opened in 1877, and was used for athletics, cricket, cycle racing and football. An oval ground, it had a stand around 100 feet long on the western side and banking around the remainder of the pitch.Paul Smith & Shirley Smith (2005) The Ultimate Directory of English & Scottish Football League Grounds Second Edition 1888‚Äì2005, Yore Publications, p13, In the 1886‚Äì87 season the ground was the venue of the FA Cup semi-final between Aston Villa and Rangers, with the attendance of 7,000 probably being the ground record. On 16 April 1887 the ground was used for the Welsh Cup final between Chirk and Davenham. An attendance of 1,500 witnessed Chirk win 2-1. On 4 February 1888 the ground hosted the opening match of the 1887‚Äì88 British Home Championship, which saw England beat Wales 5‚Äì1. Crewe were founder members of the Football League Second Division in 1892, and the first League match played at the ground saw Crewe defeat Grimsby Town 1‚Äì0 in front of 2,000 spectators. The last match at the ground was played on 28 March 1896, with Liverpool's 7‚Äì0 win on the day also being Crewe's record home defeat at the ground. However, it was not Crewe's last home league match of the season, which was played at the Vicarage in the nearby town of Sandbach. Crewe were voted out of the Football League at the end of the 1895‚Äì96 season, and subsequently played at several different grounds until returning to the area to play at the original Gresty Road ground in 1897. They later moved to the modern-day Gresty Road ground in 1906.Smith & Smith, p62 The Alexandra Recreation Ground is now the site of the Rail House office building, a car park and part of the modern Gresty Road stadium. ==References== Category:Defunct football venues in England Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C.

From 2011, Pucci published Nielsen ratings data for major cable channels such as Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, and the Hub Network, as well as multiple sports television networks. Many of the site's ratings, specifically those for Adult Swim and the Hub Network, were later republished on the television news site TV Media Insights, of which Pucci is a contributor. On May 22, 2014, Pucci announced that the site had been site shut down following copyright infringement reports. ==Impact== From its inception, the site was referenced by numerous sources. Robert Seidman and Bill Gorman, founders of TV by the Numbers, attributed Pucci for use of his data in their selected cable rating reports, comparisons of top-performing programs, final- day broadcast ratings and time-period breakdowns, among others. The Futon Critic, a similar website, also republished Pucci's data for its select cable ratings reports. Elsewhere, Son of the Bronx was cited in articles regarding sports television networks by sources such as the Dayton Daily News, Scripps Howard News Service (via the Associated Press), Soccer America, Yahoo!

He learned maque lacquer techniques when he was eleven, from primary school teacher and master craftsman Francisco Reyes, spending time at the teacher's house and helping. First he learned to make pre Hispanic lacquer, which is made from an oil mix made from chia seeds and an insect. Later he rediscovered the techniques for inlaying gold in lacquered pieces working as a student of Pedro Fabi√°n and Salvador Solchaga. His mother, a teacher, wanted him to study a profession but he did not like it. His three sisters did become teachers. Gasper is still in P√°tzcuaro, living and working with his artisan wife Beatriz Ortega Ruiz, a native of nearby Erongar√≠cuaro. The couple has taught the techniques to their four children, but the couple prefers that they do something else for a living, as the crafts themselves do not pay well enough. ==Career== Pieces from the artisan's workshop on display in Mexico City ===Lacquer work=== Gaspar owns his workshop in the town and works with his wife, herself an accomplished artisan. For his maque lacquer work, she creates the natural pigments, stating that the nature of this work requires family involvement. Maque is a pre Hispanic lacquering technique which Gaspar prefers, but more modern lacquering, called ‚Äúlaca‚Äù is done at the workshop, mostly by Ortega Ruiz. She draws her designs from memory, most of which are traditional but she has a few of her own invention. Gaspar's maque projects start with wooden pieces already formed by other artisans, usually made from Alnus jorullensis (Mexican alder) or Tilia mexicana (Cirimo) as both are low in resin content and absorb the maque better. Before the process begins, the piece is thoroughly dried, alternating between sun and shade, turning the pieces so that they do not warp or split. Then they are sanded thoroughly and sometimes repaired with plaster. The decorating and lacquering processes are intricate and require patience. Maque is lacquer made from the seeds of the chia plant, mixed with crushed aje, an insect found in various parts of Mexico. In Michoac√°n it comes from the Tierra Caliente region. Gaspar insists on chia oil, even though some artisans have switched to linseed. He states that the latter is not of the same quality and is not water resistant. Gaspar working on a gold piece at the workshop in Patzcuaro The background coloring and lacquering is applied first, the most traditional of which is ‚Äúcharanda‚Äù or a dark red, which traditionally uses natural pigments. Other, lighter colors can also be used. This step takes the most time, weeks, sometimes months to assure that the color is applied evenly and rubbed well into the wood, working in small areas at a time. After the background color is applied and set, decoration begins, usually either with a pencil or etching tool. Contrasting colors are applied with differently colored lacquers, drying and polishing each color before moving onto the next. If the piece is to have inlay, grooves are cut into the wood. The artisan prefers traditional designs for his pieces but he also does custom work by request. Most of his lacquered pieces are trays, large deep dishes called ‚Äúbateas‚Äù and other relatively flat items. The largest pieces can take up to three years to complete and cost up to $50,000 Mexican pesos. ===Pasta de ca√±a=== Bundle of cornstalks and head for an image taken at the workshop in Patzcuaro Gaspar and his wife are also known for their work in ‚Äúpasta de ca√±a‚Äù, the creation of sculptures and figures from a mass made from a mash of cornstalks, nopal cactus and orchid bulbs. This craft was originally used to create pre Hispanic god figures and in the colonial era, it was adopted to Christian images because of it light weight. He worked in the 2000s to revive the craft in P√°tzcuaro, and has made a number of Christ figures as well as a nativity scene which was given to the Vatican in 2012. However, Gaspar prefers maque work to pasta de ca√±a, so Ortega Ruiz does most of this work, especially preparing the cornstalk paste. The species of orchids needed are now under protection so the couple has created a greenhouse to grow their own with the support of the Universidad Michoacana de San Nicol√°s de Hidalgo (UMSNH). ===Other activities=== Gaspar's work as an artisan has also led him to work in conservation and promotional efforts related to P√°tzcuaro and its traditional crafts. In 1995, he began to work with artisans in Temalacatzingo and other location in Guerrero state to recover traditional techniques of making lacquer, and has given courses on the various aspects of handcraft and folk art production, mostly through the Uni√≥n de Artesanos de la Casa d e los Once Patios in P√°tzcuaro and later with the state secretary of the economy and UMSNH. He has served as president of the Uni√≥n de Artesanos Decoradores Maestros Salvador Solchaga at various times, as well as president of the Uni√≥n de Artesanos de la Casa de los Once Patios. In 2007, he was president of the commemorative committee called ‚ÄúP√°tzcuaro, Ciudad de Michoac√°n‚Äù and served as an artisan advisor to P√°tzcuaro Cultura, A.C. He has also presented at conferences in Mexico at the Universidad Tecnol√≥gica de M√©xico UNITEC (2003), a seminar on Mexican folk art and intellectual property at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (2012) and other locations. Internationally he participated in a number of events. In 1996, he represented Mexican handcrafts at an exhibition in Chicago. In 1998 he participated in the first Latin American and European Artisan Summit in Zaragoza, Spain. In 1997, he helped to organize the Mexican artisan delegation to the Foro Bol√≠var in Guatemala. In 2006 he was part of the Mexican delegation at the VII Encuentro del a Promoci√≥n y Difusi√≥n de Patrimonio Inmaterial de Pa√≠ses Iberoamericanos in Venezuela. ===Recognitions=== Gaspar's work can be found in collection in both Mexico and abroad and he won awards for his work. The Fomento Cultural Banamex named him a ‚Äúgrand master‚Äù in 2001, and in 2010 he received the Vasco de Quiroga Prize from the city of P√°tzcuaro. The municipality of P√°tzcuaro recognized him along with Ortega Ruiz for the work done for the Vatican. ==References== Category:Mexican artists Category:Artists from Michoac√°n Category:Living people Category:People from P√°tzcuaro Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mario Agust√≠n Gaspar"},{"id":"42092649","text":"Sinerv√§ is a rather small lake in Central Finland, in Multia municipality.

The film was produced by Y-Films and distributed by Yash Raj Film. The film stars Riteish Deshmukh and Rhea Chakraborty, with Vivek Oberoi in a substantial role. Oberoi has returned to Yash Raj Films after 15 years, his last film under their banner was Saathiya. The film was released on 16 June 2017. ==Plot== This movie is a dark comedy involving three clueless and inept criminals who pick the worst day possible to rob a bank. The plot starts with a simple Marathi manoos and a Vaastu adherent, Champak Chandrakant Chiplunkar (Riteish Deshmukh), who is planning to rob a local bank in Mumbai. Two of his friends, Genda (Vikram Thapa) and Gulab (Bhuvan Arora), assist him in orchestrating the robbery. In preparation for the heist Champak disguises himself as a sadhu and his accomplices wear elephant and horse masks. The bandits successfully make it past the bank‚Äôs security carrying weapons, thereafter taking over the entire bank at gunpoint. But the heist soon unravels rather haphazardly, resulting in the robbers seizing twenty-eight individuals inside the bank hostage. Among the hostages inside the bank, consisting of seventeen men and eleven women, are bank staff and customers, including a nervous housewife, a sassy female bank teller, a hyperactive male chef, the rapper Baba Sehgal and Jugnu (Sahil Vaid) who is purporting to be a Faizabadi undercover police officer on duty. Powerless and defenseless, each hostage is soon tied up with his (or her) hands zip-tied behind his (or her) back. The robbers bundle the bound hostages into a back room and force the manager to open the vault. Champak continues composing stories to persuade the hostages about his white-collar class foundation to compensate for the fortune that has evaded him. In any case, things get off-track rapidly, making the bank robbers run into Amjad Khan (Vivek Oberoi) who is a heartless and tough CBI officer with a ‚Äúshoot first ask questions later‚Äù attitude. The CBI officer threatens to use force against the bank robbers, giving them a one hour deadline to surrender and not caring about the hostages‚Äô lives if the deadline expires. In the midst of everything occurring inside the bank there is a much larger plot unfolding as the Indian Minister of Home Affairs takes an interest in the bank robbery; there is a disk inside the bank with compromising information that threatens to destroy his political career. There is also the expected mad-media circus outside the bank led by crime reporter Gayatri Ganguly aka Gaga (Rhea Chakraborty) whose idol in the movie is Arnab Goswami. Eventually Champak and his accomplices decide to end the bank robbery and free the bank staff and customers, removing the zip-ties fastening their hands behind their backs and letting them all go. But just as the hostages are about to exit the bank, one of them, Jugnu reveals himself to be a ruthless bank robber who is secretly working for the Indian Home Minister to procure the compromising disc that threatens to expose him in a political scandal. In a transition of power from the old bank robbers to the new bank robbers, Jugnu and his fellow perpetrators hijack the bank at gunpoint, shooting and seriously wounding an elderly male hostage and taking the original bank robbers, Champak and his accomplices, as their own hostages in a new bank robbery. As the sands of power inside the bank shift from Champak to Jugnu, Jugnu forces the old bank robbers to assist him and his team with their own bank heist. In the meantime the twenty-seven remaining bank staff and customers are forced to transition from being Champak‚Äôs hostages to becoming Jugnu‚Äôs hostages. The ruthless new bank robbers force the hostages to kneel on the ground; each bank employee and customer is now compelled to keep his (or her) hands behind his (or her) head at all times. While all this chaos is unfolding, Amjad Khan discovers that Champak is no longer the real bank robber but his efforts to investigate the bank robbery are thwarted as the corrupt Minister for Home Affairs orders the investigation of the ongoing bank robbery transferred from the CBI to the local Mumbai police in an effort to help Jugnu. At one point the CBI officer is invited to enter the bank to check that all the hostages are still alive and safe. The CBI officer enters the premises to discover the terrified bank staff and customers inside a back room, all compelled to sit on the floor with their hands behind their heads. During this time Jugnu instructs Champak to try and fool the CBI officer by pretending that he (i.e. Champak) is still the bank robber and that he (i.e. Jugnu) is still a hostage. At this point Champak offers to let the CBI officer take the injured elderly male hostage for medical treatment. When the CBI officer leaves, Jugnu beats up Champak for letting one of the hostages go, much to the alarm and fright of the remaining hostages. Eventually Champak and his partners outwit Jugnu and his accomplices and help free all the captives inside the bank. In an act of chivalry, Champak and his team help free the female hostages first. But eventually all the hostages are freed. The released bank workers and customers embrace Champak and his partners as their heroes for saving their lives. Jugnu is ultimately captured. The corrupt Minister for Home Affairs is exposed when the information on the disk inside the bank becomes public knowledge. At the end it is revealed that the three who freed the hostages were the actual bank robbers who robbed many banks and all the work done by them was a part to expose the home minister who killed his partner who was a journalist while he was gathering evidence against the home minister. They were also the actual persons who ran away with the money. Amjad Khan admits that they are the only robbers whose mind he could not read. == Cast == * Riteish Deshmukh as Champak * Vivek Oberoi as CBI Officer Amjad Khan * Vikram Thapa as Genda * Rhea Chakraborty as Gayatri Ganguly, a journalist * Sahil Vaid as Jugnu * Bhuvan Arora as Gulab * Baba Sehgal as Himself * Naveen Kaushik * Kavish Majumdar as Mukesh * Vikram Gokhale * Upendra Limaye * Harpal Singh Sokhi ==ProductionCritical Reception== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 20%, based on five reviews with an average rating of 4.3/10. == Soundtrack == The soundtrack was released on 24 May 2017 by YRF Music. ==References * Category:2017 films Category:2010s action comedy films Category:2017 black comedy films Category:2010s heist films Category:Indian action comedy films Category:Indian black comedy films Category:Indian heist films Category:Films scored by Shamir Tandon Category:Indian films Category:2010s Hindi-language films ","title":"Bank Chor"},{"id":"42092757","text":"Edward Everett McGowan (March 20, 1900 ‚Äì May 1982) was an American professional ice hockey player.

It was one of four buildings Sullivan designed in the western United States. Built in 1892, it was demolished in 1964. It was described by the Historic American Buildings Survey as the best work by Sullivan in the west. The building's contractor was Bernard Henry Lichter. Tenants included a post office, the Alta Club, and offices of architects and engineers. The Dooly Building was named for John E. Dooly (1841-?), a member of the building's investment syndicate and a prominent civic leader. The six- story building used a structural steel frame, with a masonry facade and wood floor joists, fireproofed by cinder aggregate in the joist spaces. The exterior featured a sandstone storefront at street level, with a row of paired arched windows above. The top four floors were brick with paired sashes, the topmost pairs arched at the top. A plain, deeply overhanging cornice crowned the building. The main entrance was a deep arch at the center of the long elevation. The rear walls were common brick, plainly detailed. Heating was originally provided by pot-belly stoves in each suite with flues in the building's columns. The McIntyre Building (1908-09), also in Salt Lake City, designed by architect Richard Kletting, has been asserted to be \\"the earliest and best example of Sullivanesque architecture in the state\\" besides the Dooly Building. ==Referenceshttp://saltlakearchitecture.blogspot.com/2009/03/dooly-building.html Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Utah Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1892 Category:Louis Sullivan buildings Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Utah Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1964 ","title":"Dooly Building"},{"id":"42092806","text":"Minh ƒê·∫°o may refer to: *Minh ƒê·∫°o (1042‚Äì1043), era name used by L√Ω Th√°i T√¥ng *Minh ƒê·∫°o or Ng≈© chi Minh ƒê·∫°o, a group of five Sino-Vietnamese religions, see Vietnamese folk religion#Minh ƒê·∫°o *Minh ƒê·∫°o, B·∫Øc Ninh, a commune in Ti√™n Du District, B·∫Øc Ninh, Vietnam ==See also== *Ming Dao, Taiwanese actor *Mingdao (disambiguation) ","title":"Minh ƒê·∫°o"},{"id":"42092810","text":"Maurice Brenot (December 29, 1894 ‚Äì April 30, 1964Hockey deaths - April 1964) was a professional ice hockey player.

He was the creator of sets for numerous productions including those for the world premieres of Rossini's La gazzetta, Otello, Armida, Mos√® in Egitto, and La donna del lago. Tortoli was born in Florence and died in Naples of cholera at the age of 35. ==Life and career== Born in Florence in 1790,Mancini and Ragni p. 102 Tortoli was the nephew and student of Antonio Niccolini, a Tuscan architect who later had a substantial career in Naples. Niccolini rebuilt the interior of the Teatro San Carlo after it burned down in 1816 and was also the theatre's chief scenographer. Tortoli was active as a scenery painter under the direction of Niccolini by 1808 when he worked on the sets for the first performance of Antonio Sacchini's Edipo a Colono at the Teatro San Carlo.Casaglia The Teatro San Carlo, rebuilt after the fire of 1816 By the time Rossini arrived in Naples in the summer of 1815, Niccolini, at the height of his prestige and over-committed on multiple projects, was getting ready to concede the titular post of the San Carlo's chief scenographer to Tortoli.Bucarelli p. 294 After the San Carlo had been destroyed by fire in February 1816, opera productions were held in other Neapolitan theatres during the rebuilding period. Tortoli was the scenographer for the premieres of Rossini's La gazzetta (Teatro dei Fiorentini, 26 September 1816) and Otello (Teatro del Fondo, 4 December 1816). When the newly rebuilt San Carlo was inaugurated on 12 January 1817, Tortoli was one of the scenographers for the gala performance of Simone Mayr's Il sogno di Partenope. By February of that year, when he designed the production of Carlo Saccenti's Aganadeca, Tortoli was the titular scenographer at the San Carlo, a post he would hold until his death, although Niccolini continued to provide overall artistic supervision of the productions there.Casaglia; Bucarelli p. 294 When the impresario Domenico Barbaja was nearing the end of his management of the Neapolitan royal theatres, Tortoli also had the authority to sign contracts on the theatres' behalf. Shortly after the success of Donizetti's opera L'ajo nell'imbarazzo in 1824, Donizetti signed a contract with Tortoli to adapt the work for Naples as Don Gregorio, although it was not staged there until 1826.Ashbrook p. 31 and note 72 p. 606 Both Barbaja and Tortoli had found themselves under suspicion in February 1824 after a fire broke out beneath the stage. While it was quickly put out, suspicion arose because Barbaja's management contract was about to run out (and with it, a loss of several forms of revenue). With the discovery of accounting irregularities on Barbaja's part, it was felt that the intendant had deliberately set fire to the opera house. Also accused as being part of the plot were Scipione Cerrone (the theatre's fireworks expert) and Luigi Corazza (the head of stage machinery). Barbaja was placed under house arrest, but Tortoli was incarcerated in the Santa Maria Apparente prison where he contracted cholera. On the request of Niccolini, he was taken under guard from the prison to the Barbaja's villa in Mergellina on the Neapolitan coast where he died on 20 May 1824.Ragghianti p. xciiAccording to Mancini and Ragni p. 89, Tortoli died in the prison. Original Italian :\\"Coinvolto nella vicenda assieme a Domenico Barbaja, all'esperto di fuochi artificiali Scipione Cerrone e al capo macchinista Luigi Corazza, il Tortolj venne rinchiuso nel carcere di Santa Maria Apparente dove mor√¨ di colera il 20 maggio di quello stesso anno.\\" A hearing two months later cleared both men for lack of evidence.Eisenbeiss p.129 ==World premiere productions== World premieres for which Tortoli was the scenographer include:Unless otherwise indicated, all entries are sourced from Casaglia.

The game was developed by German studio Deck13 Interactive and published by Kalypso Media, also from Germany. Blood Knights was released on 1 November 2013 for the Xbox 360, 13 November 2013 for the PC, and 19 November 2013 for the PlayStation 3. The game features two playable characters: Jeremy, a vampire hunter, and Alysa, a vampire that Jeremy became ritually bound to, on a quest to retrieve an artifact that can cause cataclysms. The game features both single player and local cooperative gameplay (co-op) modes, but does not allow for online co-op. Blood Knights received generally negative reviews upon release, with a large number of critics faulting the game for showing a lack of creativity and having uninteresting gameplay. ==Gameplay== Jeremy and Alysa engage in combat in co- op mode The game combines platformer, role-playing, and combat elements. Players move about several levels, including a forest and a castle, using precision jumping and puzzle solving to move about the level. Players can discover equipable weapons and armor that improves effectiveness in combat by exploring levels for chests. Combat takes the form of set piece battles, in which a number of enemies appear and must be defeated before the player can continue to progress through the area. These enemies include human outlaws, demons, werewolves, and other vampires. The game also contains boss battles, in which the player must defeat a significantly stronger enemy that is aided by normal enemies. Players assume control of Jeremy, a sword-wielding, melee- focused character, and Alysa, who uses crossbows to deliver ranged attacks. The game can be played as a single player game, in which the player alternates between controlling Jeremy and Alysa, or as a local co-op game, in which two players play cooperatively, with one controlling each character. Blood Knights does not support online co-op. Like most hack and slash games, the control scheme is minimal. When controlling Jeremy, players can chain attacks using one button (the X button on the Xbox 360), and can use a number of special attacks that have a cooldown timer, including a heavy blow, a whirlwind attack, and a power that draws distant enemies to Jeremy. While controlling Alysa, the game functions as a twin-stick shooter, in which movement is controlled by one thumbstick or set of keys, and firing weapons is controlled by the other thumbstick or another set of keys. Alysa also has special attacks, including the ability to fire flaming arrows and a grenade attack. In single player gameplay, the player can switch between Jeremy and Alysa by pressing a button (the Y button on the Xbox 360). Players can transfer health, in the form of blood, between the two playable characters, healing one at the expense of the other. ==Plot== Blood Knights takes place in a fictional version of Earth in which humans and vampires are at war. The main character, Jeremy, is the captain of a holy order that fights vampires. At the beginning of the game, the order travels to a set of ruins to protect the Blood Seal, a powerful artifact, from being captured by the vampires. The order suffers heavy losses in the attempt, and in desperation the priest Bartholomew uses a ritual to bind Jeremy to the vampire Alysa. During the course of Jeremy's attempt to retrieve the seal, he is turned into a vampire, and the vampires seize the seal themselves. With the seal removed from its resting place, the moon begins to crack apart, causing unpredictable and violent tides. Because Jeremy has been turned into a vampire himself, Bartholomew and another member of the holy order, Castello, kick Jeremy and Alysa into an abyss inside the ruins, abandoning them for dead. Castello assumes Jeremy's place as the captain of the order. Jeremy and Alysa escape the ruins and pursue the vampires that stole the Blood Seal. Castello and the holy order are also pursuing the vampires. Jeremy and Alysa reach Godskeep, a human stronghold. In order to pass through the town, the pair must first rescue the town's sheriff, who went into a nearby forest with the town guard in an attempt to kill the powerful vampire Blood Fox. Jeremy and Alysa defeat Blood Fox, and in the town, Jeremy encounters Bartholomew, who split from Castello after an argument. Bartholomew tasks Jermey with recovering the Relic of Light, a powerful weapon that can be used against the vampires, in order to prove that Jeremy is still loyal to the order. After retrieving the weapon, Jeremy is informed that the Lords of Pikehold, a group of knights that defends the area, have defeated the vampire army carrying the blood seal. On his way to Pikehold Castle, Jeremy is then ambushed by Castello. The pair fight Castello, who falls off a cliff after being defeated. Inside Pikehold Castle, Jeremy discovers that the Lords of Pikehold have become thralls to a succubus. Jeremy and Alysa defeat the Lords of Pikehold and the succubus, who informs Jeremy that the Blood Seal has been taken by a vampire mage to the top of a mountain. Bartholomew meets Jeremy and Alysa at the top of the mountain, and informs the pair that the vampires have already summoned a powerful demon that will slaughter mankind. Bartholomew has called upon the army of Rome, led by the powerful First Paladin of Rome, to defeat the demon. Jeremy, knowing that the First Paladin of Rome would kill him and Alysa on sight, sets off to defeat the demon before the army of Rome arrives. When Jeremy and Alysa confront the demon, it explains that it was summoned because the humans have become too numerous, and with increased numbers they have gone from fearing vampires to hunting them. Jeremy and Alysa kill the demon and Bartholomew recovers the Blood Seal. As he does this, the First Paladin of Rome arrives and demands the seal for himself. Bartholomew gives the seal to Jeremy instead, and battles the Paladin to delay the army of Rome. Jeremy travels back to the ruins from the beginning of the game, only to find that the army of Rome has beaten him there. Jeremy and Alysa meet the First Paladin in the Blood Seal's resting chamber. The Paladin explains that he wishes to destroy the seal, causing a great deluge that will bring the people, who had stopped believing the Church's teachings, back under the Church's influence. Jeremy refuses to allow the Paladin to do this, and the Paladin attacks. After being injured, the Paladin pulls back and Castello appears and attacks. Jeremy and Alysa kill Castello, and the Paladin re-enters the fight. Jeremy and Alysa appear to severely wound the First Paladin, but he boasts that vampires cannot kill him, as he is under the protection of Rome. Bartholomew emerges from behind the Blood Seal's resting place and slits the First Paladin's throat from behind, killing him. Bartholomew claims that although the Blood Seal was destroyed in battle, the moon will heal itself. He reveals that while he has heard that it can be done, he does not personally know how to turn Jeremy back into a human, and unless he is human, the bond between him and Alysa cannot be undone. The game ends with Jeremy and Alysa agreeing to work together to find a way to reverse Jeremy's transformation into a vampire. ==Development== Blood Knights went through a number of delays before being published. Announced by German publisher dtp entertainment in July 2012, the game was originally scheduled for release in the summer of 2012. In a Game Informer article published on 3 September 2012, the release date was given as 31 October 2012 (Halloween). This date was later shifted back to December 2012, citing \\"legal negotiations\\", and then to 20 February 2013, citing a need for more development time. 20 February passed with neither the release of the game nor an announcement by the developer or publisher, although both Xbox.com and Amazon.de now listed release dates in mid-march. Developer Deck13 Interactive then announced a release date of 19 March 2013.Dunning, Jason (21 February 2013). \\"Blood Knights Delayed, March 19th, 2013 Date Now Expected (Update: Deck13‚Ä≤s Reponse)\\" . PlayStationLifeStyle.net. CraveOnline. Retrieved 18 March 2014. On 5 March 2013, Deck 13 founder Jan Klose explained that the release date remained uncertain, expecting the game to be released no later than mid- May 2013. Klose called the game 99.9% complete, and blamed the delays on financial difficulties at dtp entertainment, which necessitated that Deck 13 become a co-publisher and take on responsibilities that the studio not planned for. The game was eventually released by a different publisher, Kalypso Media, as the first game under their digital-only label \\"Kobolt Games\\". The game was finally released on 1 November 2013 for the Xbox 360, 13 November 2013 for the PC, and 19 November 2013 for the PlayStation 3. ==Reception== Blood Knights received mixed to poor reviews upon release. At Metacritic, a video game review aggregator, the Xbox 360 version of the game received an average score of 45 out of 100, based on 7 reviews. The UK Official Xbox Magazine remarked that \\"Blood Knights holds as much annoyance as satisfaction\\", while the US version of Official Xbox Magazine contended that \\"Blood Knights is too easy to ever become actively irritating, but its deficit of danger makes it too darn dull to hold even a devoted horror nut‚Äôs attention for long\\". Critics took issue with the game's lack of originality. Henry Kelly of The Digital Fix comments that \\"The character models are quite basic and unimaginative - Jeremy has typically harsh features and the female characters are given skimpy outfits to show off their stereotyped fantasy physiques\\". X-ONE Magazine calls the game an \\"unashamed clone of Diablo\\", which borrows mechanics, naming conventions, and character archetypes from Diablo. The gameplay was considered by critics to be too easy, with a terrible enemy AI that made combat unchallenging, interspersed with what Henry Kelly called \\"painfully simple non-puzzles\\". Other components that faced criticism included the shallowness of the RPG elements, the lack of online co-op, and the dialogue, which was considered poorly written and occasionally poorly acted. Reviewers did, however, have positive things to say about the game's co-op system, lack of online support notwithstanding. Cameron Lewis of Official Xbox Magazine US, in the summary of his review, noted that \\"complementary characters make local co- op effective\\". The UK version of the magazine called the co-op \\"pleasant\\", while X-ONE Magazine felt that the mode gave the game more substance. == Notes == : GameRankings tracks ratings for each platform separately, and does not have a page for the PlayStation 3 version. : Metacritic tracks ratings for each platform separately, and does not assign aggregate scores for a platform until it receives at least four reviews specific to that platform.

Hastings and Edith R. (Snyder) Hastings. He attended the public schools, and then learned electrical engineering by correspondence course. He worked for the Troy City Railway Company, and later for United Traction. In his leisure time, he built a hydro-electric power station in West Sand Lake. He incorporated the Wynantskill Hydro-Electric Company, and supplied electric light to the surrounding areas. He was President of the company until 1926 when he sold out, and retired from business. He then entered politics as a Republican, and was Supervisor of the Town of Sand Lake from 1927 to 1936. Hastings was a member of the New York State Senate (31st D.) from 1937 to 1944, sitting in the 160th, 161st, 162nd, 163rd and 164th New York State Legislatures. On June 3, 1944, he was appointed by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey as Treasurer of Rensselaer County, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Avery G. Hall.

Let ABCD be a tangential quadrilateral with at most one pair of parallel sides. Furthermore, let E and F the midpoints of its diagonals AC and BD and P be the center of its incircle. Given such a configuration the point P is located on the Newton line, that is line EF connecting the midpoints of the diagonals. A tangential quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides is a rhombus. In this case both midpoints and the center of the incircle coincide and by definition no Newton line exists. Newton's theorem can easily be derived from Anne's theorem considering that in tangential quadrilaterals the combined lengths of opposite sides are equal (Pitot theorem: a + c = b + d). Now according to Anne's theorem showing that the combined areas of opposite triangles PAD and PBC and the combined areas of triangles PAB and PCD are equal is sufficient to ensure that P lies on EF. Let r be the radius of the incircle, then r is also the altitude of all four triangles. :\\\\begin{align} &A;(\\\\triangle PAB)+A(\\\\triangle PCD) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] ={}&\\\\tfrac{1}{2}ra+\\\\tfrac{1}{2}rc=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}r(a+c) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] ={}&\\\\tfrac{1}{2}r(b+d)=\\\\tfrac{1}{2}rc+\\\\tfrac{1}{2}rd \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] ={}&A;(\\\\triangle PBC)+A(\\\\triangle PAD) \\\\end{align} ==References== *Claudi Alsina, Roger B.

It is located on the north side of Pound Road near its intersection with Ten Rod Road. Built in 1823, it is one of the best-preserved 19th-century pounds in southeastern New Hampshire, and is now maintained by the Farmington Historical Society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. ==Description and history== The Farmington Town Pound is located near the geographic center of the roughly square town, on the northwest side of Pound Road north of its junction with Ten Rod Road. The pound is a stone structure square, consisting of four walls made of dry-laid fieldstone about high and wide at the base. The walls are topped with long granite capstones. There is an opening about wide on the south side, facing Pound Road, which once had a granite lintel stone over the top, but this has fallen. From the early 18th century, towns in New Hampshire were required to fund the construction and maintenance of a structure in which to pen stray livestock until it could be claimed by its owner. The early structures were typically of wood, and none of those are known to survive. This pound was built in 1823 by the town, replacing an earlier wooden structure built in 1802, and is one of a few well-preserved pounds in southeastern New Hampshire. It was built by Nicholas Colbath for $59, and was located on land purchased by the town from Hunkin Colbath for $5. It remained in use until late in the 19th century, and was sold into private hands in 1918. It was given back to the town, and is now maintained by the Farmington Historical Society. ==Gallery== Farmington_Town_Pound_National_Register_of_Historic_Places_Marker.JPGHistoric marker at the Farmington Town Pound site.

Launched in March 2014, they replaced the national Smooth Radio that had launched in 2010 on FM, and most outlets of Gold on MW. Each FM station broadcasts localised breakfast and drivetime programming on weekdays, with networked shows simulcast from London at all other times. Three of the six FM stations, and all eighteen AM frequencies, are owned and operated by Global, with the remaining three FM licences owned by Communicorp and run as a franchise. ==Background== Having previously operated under a number of regional licences, Smooth Radio's owners, GMG Radio merged its five English stations into one quasi-national station, launching the brand on the Digital One national DAB network on 4 October 2010. Most of the output was broadcast from Salford Quays in Manchester, with other programming coming from Castlereagh Street in London. On 25 June 2012, GMG Radio's owners, Guardian Media Group sold its radio division to Global at an estimated price of between ¬£50 million and ¬£70 million. Global renamed GMG Radio \\"Real and Smooth Radio Ltd.\\" Several rival radio groups expressed their concerns over the takeover and the effect it could have on commercial radio in the UK. Ofcom launched a review of the sale, and it was announced that GMG Radio and Global would continue to operate as separate entities while the review was conducted. On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt instructed Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to examine Global's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50% of the UK radio market because of concerns the takeover may not be in the public interest. On 11 October, the OFT concluded that the merger could lead to a rise in local advertising costs because of the decrease in competitors, and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013. The Competition Commission published its final report into the acquisition on 21 May 2013, requiring Global to sell radio stations in seven locations. Global subsequently appealed the decision, but this was rejected by the Competition Appeal Tribunal in November. Global announced in December that it would not contest the decision, and would instead begin the process of selling the assets as directed by the Commission. On 4 February 2014, the Radio Today website reported that Ofcom had given Global permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform, and to replace it with a service playing music from the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Under this agreement, Smooth would continue to broadcast on its regional frequencies, but would be required to provide seven hours of local output per day. On 6 February, Global confirmed the sale of eight of its regional stationsincluding those with the Smooth Radio brand in the North West, North East and East Midlandsto the Irish media holdings company Communicorp. Under a franchising agreement between the two firms, these stations would retain the Smooth Radio name, but relaunch airing a mixture of both regional content and networked programming from London. Smooth would also take over Gold's medium wave frequencies, except in London, Manchester and the East Midlands. Global announced later that month that Smooth would be relaunched on 3 March, and subsequently confirmed the Gold changes would take effect from 24 March, when the stations would begin simulcasting with Smooth Radio London. This also coincided with the return of local programming at breakfast and drivetime. On 5 March 2018, Global added the former Lakeland Radio station to the network as Smooth Lake District following its purchase from the CN Group for an undisclosed fee.Lakeland Radio Sold To Global Entertainment Group, Lakeland Radio, 20 November 2017 Local weekend afternoon programming ended on 25 August 2019.

Roxa first travelled to the islands in 1830 and was part of Luis Vernet's original colony. After the British return she became a landowner and businesswoman. She died of cancer in 1869. == Early life == The exact circumstances of Roxa's birth are not known for certain and it is uncertain whether she was born in what is now Argentina or Uruguay. An article in the Launceston Advertiser, Tasmania of 19 June 1836 describes her as \\"Antonina, an Indian of Salta by birth.\\" Her date of birth is generally given as and she was reputed to have been a princess as the daughter of an aboriginal chief.Tatham, 2008, pp. 470 However, most contemporary sources describe her as of South American heritage. == Falklands == Roxa arrived in the Falkland Islands in 1830, during the period in which Luis Vernet was establishing a settlement at Port Louis () in the ruins of the former Spanish penal colony of Puerto Soledad (previously the French settlement of Fort St. Louis).Cawkell, 2001, pp. 48 When the majority of the population chose to leave following the raid of the USS Lexington in 1831,Cawkell, 2001, pp. 55 Roxa was one of a group of 24 individuals who chose to remain in the islands. These individuals continued to trade on behalf of Vernet but Vernet refused to return as Military and Civil Commander in the Islands.Cawkell, 2001, pp. 61 In October 1832, the ARA Sarand√≠ commanded by Major Jos√© Mar√≠a Pinedo arrived to install Major Esteban Mestivier as the new Military and Civil Commander in the IslandsPepper, 2008, pp. 368‚Äì369 . In November 1832, shortly after the Sarand√≠ departed on patrol the garrison mutinied and murdered Mestivier. Order was restored by the crews of the British sealer Rapid and the French whaler Jean Jacques. When the Sarand√≠ returned in December, Pinedo took control of the settlement. In January 1833, HMS Clio arrived and her captain, James Onslow, informed Pinedo he was there to reassert British sovereignty and requested that Pinedo leave with the garrison. Pinedo departed on 4 January 1833 in the Sarand√≠ followed by the Rapid the next day taking the garrison to Buenos Aires. Of the persons present in the remains of Vernet's settlement, four chose to leave in the Rapid leaving twenty-three residents in the now renamed Port Louis. HMS Clio did not remain long, staying only ten days and sailing after placing William Dickson in charge of the settlement. Roxa again chose to remain in the settlement and is listed by Thomas Helsby (Vernet's clerk) as one of the residents in the islands. Vernet sent Matthew Brisbane back to the Falklands to run his affairs, he arrived in March 1833, during the first visit of HMS Beagle.Cawkell, 2001, pp. 62 The Gaucho's wished to be paid in Silver as Captain Onslow of the Clio had promised but Brisbane continued with Vernet's policies. This led to a dispute over pay and resulted in the so-called Gaucho Murders of August 1833 in which Brisbane, Dickson and three other senior members of the settlement were murdered.Cawkell, 2001, pp. 63 Roxa and other survivors of the killing spree fled to Hog Island where they remained until Lt. Smith was installed as the British resident in 1834 After the murderers had been captured and removed from the Falkland Islands Roxa was one of only fourteen residents who remained from Vernet's settlement.Cawkell, 2001, pp. 69 Roxa, who was a skilled Gaucho in her own right, made a deal with Lt. Smith that if she could convert the feral cattle of the islands into a milking herd she could keep every second calf. Roxa was considered a key member of a small community, in 1839 Lt. Lowcay stated that: The deal with Lt.Smith proved to be a shrewd move as by this arrangement she accrued a large herd of cattle. This grew to a point where the Admiralty became concerned and passed a query to Governor Moody who ruled she should keep the cattle. In his report to London he stated: On 1 January 1841, along with one other native of South America and also a native of Hamburg, Roxa swore allegiance to The Crown becoming a British citizen and was later mentioned by Governor Rennie as a foreigner who wished to be naturalised. The 1842 Statistical Table records Roxa as owning 6 dogs, 17 cows, 6 calves, 7 oxen, 6 fowls and a well built two-room stone cottage.1842 Statistical Table, Falkland Islands Government Archive The 1843 census records that Roxa owned 1/6 acre, several houses, ten cattle and forty sheep. When under Governor Richard Moody the seat of Government moved to Stanley it is recorded Roxa owned a plot of land and property worth ¬£30. In the late 1840s, she found employment as a nurse employed by Sir Bartholomew SullivanTatham, 2008, pp. 471 but his son describes how her fondness of drink lead to her undoing. The historian David Tatham reports her marrying Pedro Varela in 1851, after which she found employment in the Falkland Islands Company farm at Hope Place. She leased, in her own name, a station of for ¬£5 near San Carlos. Roxa died of cancer in 1869 and was buried in the cemetery in Stanley. == Personal life == At some point in the 1830s Roxa married an American sailor named Kenney (or Kinney) but they were divorced by Lt. Smith in May 1838. As reported by David Tatham, she married a Gaucho Pedro Varela 1851, a man ten years her junior, however, there is no formal record of a marriage in either the Government or Church registers.Register of Marriages, Falkland Islands Government Archive Roxa is also believed to be romantically involved with one of the soldiers involved in the mutiny against Mestivier. In a letter to the Lord Glenelg, Mr. Harger the purser of HMS Cleopatra wrote: > \\"The Spanish woman‚Äôs first husband was a soldier, he was concerned in a > murder and executed at Buenos Ayres ‚Äì her second was murdered on the island > ‚Äì her third is an American. > She is a rather good looking woman, does not appear more than thirty, and > in bodily and mental qualities is well calculated for the society she lives > in ‚Äì she rides fearlessly‚Ä¶ she shoots well.

It was originally established as Patrol Squadron VP-900 on 1 July 1946, redesignated Medium Patrol Squadron (Landplane) VP-ML-71 on 15 November 1946, redesignated VP-661 in February 1950, redesignated VP-56 on 4 February 1953 and disestablished on 28 June 1991. It was the second squadron to be designated VP-56, the first VP-56 was redesignated OTS on 1 July 1941. ==Operational history== P5M-1s c.1954 VP-56 P5M docks on in 1957 P-2H in 1963 P-3 at NAS Jacksonville in 1976 *1 July 1946: VP-900 was established at NAS Anacostia, Washington D.C. It came under the operational control of FAW-5 and administrative control of the Naval Air Reserve Training Command. The squadron was one of 21 naval reserve squadrons established after the war to accommodate the large number of aircrews recently released from active duty and utilize the enormous stocks of aircraft on the inventory. The squadron flew the PBY-5A/6A Catalina amphibian and the PV-2 Harpoon landplane. *15 November 1946: All patrol squadrons were redesignated. Regular Navy squadron designations began with 1 and reserve patrol squadron designations began with 5. VP-900 was redesignated VP-ML-71. The ML for reserve patrol squadrons included twin-engine medium amphibian seaplanes, as well as twin-engine land- based bombers. Regular Navy patrol squadron ML designations were for twin- engine medium landbased bombers only. The amphibian medium seaplanes like the PBY-5A were in the AM category. *February 1950: VP-ML-71 was redesignated VP-661 during the reorganization of the Naval Air Reserve units in 1949, but the redesignation did not take effect until February 1950. During this period the number of Naval Aviation reserve squadrons was reduced from the 1949 total of 24 to 9. *15 September 1950: VP-661 was called to active duty as a result of the Korean War. The squadron reported for duty to Commander Naval Air Force Atlantic Fleet at NAS Norfolk, Va. At the start of hostilities Navy patrol forces on active duty numbered just 20 squadrons, and it quickly became apparent that this meager figure was inadequate to meet the increased demands. By the end of 1950 seven reserve patrol squadrons were called to active duty to augment the regular Navy patrol squadrons. After reporting for duty at NAS Norfolk, Virginia, the squadron was sent to NAS Corpus Christi, Texas, for six weeks of transitional training in the PBM-5/5S2 Mariner seaplane. *May 1953: The first of the squadron‚Äôs new P5M-1 Marlin seaplanes began to arrive as replacements for the aging PBM Mariners. Pilots and ground crew personnel were sent to the Glenn L. Martin P5M school in Baltimore, Md., for training in operation and maintenance of the new aircraft. *February 1958: VP-56 came to the assistance of sister squadron VP-45 when one of its aircraft became frozen in the ice at NAS Norfolk. A group of volunteers from VP-56 found and old WWII amphibious tractor and made their way to the aircraft over the ice. They were able to chop the aircraft out of the ice and tow it to the beach. *25 January‚ÄìJune 1961: VP-56 received its first P2V-7 Neptune and began transitioning from the Marlin seaplane. Transition training was completed by 8 June 1961. *1 October‚ÄìNovember 1962: VP-56 deployed a detachment of five aircraft to NAS Guantanamo Bay, Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis. The squadron returned to NAS Norfolk in late November 1962, after earning a letter of commendation for their efforts. *15 May 1966: VP-56 deployed to Naval Air Station Sigonella, Sicily, relieving VP-23. Detachments operated at various times from RHAF Souda Bay, Crete; Capodichine, Italy; Athens, Greece; Wheelus Air Base, Libya; and Izmir Air Station, Turkey. While at Crete, the squadron was supported by . *27 May‚Äì5 June 1968: VP-56 were among the patrol squadrons and other naval units called upon to assist in the search for the ill-fated which disappeared on 21 May 1968 50 miles south of the Azores. The search proved futile, and the four VP-56 patrol aircraft were released for return to NAS Norfolk on 5 June 1968. *7 June 1968: VP-56 received a permanent change of station from NAS Norfolk, to NAS Patuxent River, Maryland Upon arrival, the Dragons began preparing for transition from the SP-2H Neptune to the P-3B Orion. *8 August 1968: VP-56 received its first P-3B Orion. Eight P-3Bs would be received by the end of the transition, replacing 12 SP-2H Neptunes. *September 1969: VP-56 received its first P-3C Orion and completed the transition training in October 1969. VP-56 were the first fleet patrol squadron to receive the P-3C. The baseline model incorporated the AN/ASQ-114 computer system for navigation and sensor functions, the first of its kind in a maritime patrol aircraft. It had an AN/AQA-7 Jezebel acoustic processing system and quadruple the number of directional sonobuoys, with a high capacity computer and related displays. *February 1970: The squadron‚Äôs first P-3C baseline Orion was retrofitted with DIFAR gear. *1 November 1970: VP-56 conducted its first deployment to Naval Air Station Keflavik, Iceland, as a P-3C squadron. The squadron was subsequently awarded a Navy Unit Commendation for its activities in surveillance of the Soviet submarine fleet during November and December 1970. *1 July 1971: VP-56 received a permanent change of station from NAS Patuxent River, Maryland to NAS Jacksonville, Florida *1 December 1971‚ÄìFebruary 1972: VP-56 deployed to NAS Keflavik, Iceland. On 25 February 1972, a disabled Soviet Hotel-class submarine was located on the surface. Squadron aircraft flew around-the-clock surveillance for five days until other Soviet ships could enter the area to assist the vessel. *6 May‚ÄìJuly 1974: VP-56 deployed to NAF Sigonella. On 22 July, the United States Ambassador to Cyprus requested the assistance of the Sixth Fleet in evacuating American citizens from Cyprus due to the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. VP-56 flew 68 sorties in support of while it covered the evacuation carried out by the Marines. *April 1983: The squadron‚Äôs P-3C baseline aircraft were retrofitted with the AQA-7V Acoustic DIFAR System. *1 January 1986: VP-56 deployed to NAF Sigonella. The squadron established a record for the number of hours spent on ship-to-aircraft tactical computerized communications, called data link, while tracking Soviet submarines in the Mediterranean. *24 March‚Äì15 April 1986: The squadron provided a detachment for support of the task force involved in operations against Libya. Operation Freedom of Navigation in the Gulf of Sidra was conducted in support of American carrier aircraft operating in international waters. In retaliation for missiles fired at U.S. Navy aircraft, airstrikes were conducted by the battle group against Libyan missile sites at Surt and three Libyan missile boats. On 14 to 15 April 1986, strikes were conducted against Benghazi and Tripoli by and battle group aircraft and USAF F-111s staging out of bases in England. *7 August‚ÄìOctober 1987: VP-56 deployed to NAS Bermuda and received a Meritorious Unit Commendation in connection with Hurricane Emily and the recovery efforts in its aftermath during the period 25 September to 23 October 1987. *28 June 1991: VP-56 was disestablished at NAS Jacksonville, Florida, with over 26 years and 178,000 hours of accident-free flying. ==Home port assignments== The squadron was assigned to these home ports, effective on the dates shown: *NAS Anacostia, Maryland 1 July 1946 *NAS Norfolk, Virginia 15 September 1950 *NAS Patuxent River, Maryland 7 June 1968 *NAS Jacksonville, Florida July 1971 ==Aircraft Assignment== The squadron first received the following aircraft on the dates shown: *PBY-5A/6A May 1946 *PV-2 May 1946 *PBM-5/5S2 September 1950 *P5M-1 May 1953 *P5M-2 1955 *P2V-7 January 1961 *SP-2H December 1962 *P-3B June 1968 *P-3C September 1969 *P-3C (MOD) 1986 *P-3C UIIIR July 1989 ==See also== * Maritime patrol aircraft * List of inactive United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of United States Navy aircraft squadrons * List of squadrons in the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons * History of the United States Navy ==References== Category:Attack squadrons of the United States Navy Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from the Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons ","title":"VP-56"},{"id":"42093172","text":"The Norton‚ÄìPolk‚ÄìMathis House, also known Villa Finale, is a historic house in San Antonio, Texas, United States.

He wrote early computer software automating iterative evaluation of direct computer models through a Jacobian matrix of complex numbers. His software enabled the Navy Electronics Laboratory (NEL) to accelerate design of sonar arrays for tracking Soviet Navy submarines during the Cold War. == Early years == Gordon was born 22 August 1925 in San Diego. He was the third of five sons of Carl Martin and Ruth (Fountain) Martin.California Birth Index 1905-1995, California Department of Health Services, Center for Health Statistics, Sacramento CA His older brother Harold enlisted in the Army National Guard and was serving on Oahu in 1941. Gordon communicated with his brother's anti-aircraft facility by amateur radio prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, and relayed information to and from other San Diego families with National Guard members on Oahu. == United States Navy == Photo of USS Higbee (DD-806) while Martin was cryptography officer. Martin enlisted in the V-12 Navy College Training Program at Kansas State Teachers College in 1943 and transferred to the University of Texas Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps. Following commissioning in 1945, Ensign Martin served as cryptography officer aboard the destroyer USS Higbee (DD-806). Following release to reserve status after World War II, he completed electrical engineering degree requirements at University of California, Berkeley and in 1947 joined the NEL team in San Diego continuing underwater sound research begun in 1942 by Glen Camp at the University of California, San Diego campus. His early work involved measurement of piezoelectric characteristics of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate (ADP) and Rochelle salt. Lieutenant (junior grade) Martin was recalled to active duty during the Korean War as the first executive officer of the prototype SOSUS station on the island of Eleuthera. As the SOSUS network expanded Lieutenant Martin moved to the United States Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory in New London, Connecticut. Martin's 1954 publication describing relationships of circuit coefficients and critical frequencies of maximum and minimum admittance in piezoelectric materials was later cited in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard on piezoelectricity. From 1954 to 1960 he led the NEL development team for a variable magnetic reluctance transducer intended for a low- frequency array. == Software development == Early sonar transducers had been developed from simplistic design assumptions followed by a trial and error design modification if the transducer failed to meet performance goals. That design approach became impractical for the large number of variables involved in optimized electrical coupling of array elements coupled acoustically by the physics of fluid water. NEL explored transducer theory with tensor analysis and continuum mechanics to determine viscous and hysteretic dissipative effects of transducer materials and radiation impedance of transducers in the water medium. NEL's mathematical models for mutual radiation impedance of transducer elements overwhelmed mechanical calculators and taxed capabilities of contemporary electronic computers. In 1961, the United States and United Kingdom undertook a joint effort to develop digital computer software for analysis and design using the ALGOL-based Navy Electronics Laboratory International Algorithmic Compiler (NELIAC). Early software used direct models to determine critical resonance and antiresonance frequencies of piezoelectric materials and immitances at those frequencies. Results were graphed and solutions were determined to the desired accuracy by visual comparison of successive runs of the direct model software. Martin developed \\"find parameters\\" software evaluating capacitance, dissipation, resonance, and antiresonance with a Jacobian matrix and its inverse to determine losses separately for dielectric, elastic, and piezoelectric properties of individual barium titanate ceramic components. He completed the software in the summer of 1964 and it was announced at the September, 1964, seminar of the Office of Naval Research. His software was translated from NELIAC to Fortran and distributed in 1965. His automated approach to inverse modeling was subsequently presented at the 1974 IEEE Ultrasonic Manufacturers Association conference and the 1980 meeting of the Acoustical Society of America. Martin completed a doctoral dissertation on lateral effects in piezoelectric systems at the University of Texas from 1964 to 1966; and continued working at NEL until his retirement in 1980. Shortly before retirement, he was awarded a patent (assigned to the United States Navy) for discrete amplitude shading for lobe-suppression in a discrete transducer array. Martin founded Martin Analysis Software Technology Company following retirement; and contracted with the Navy for high-resolution beamforming with generalized eigenvector/eigenvalue (GEVEV) digital signal processing from 1985 through 1987 and for personal computer aided engineering (PC CAE) of underwater transducers and arrays from 1986 through 1989. Martin published an expanded theory of matrices in 2012 entitled A New Approach to Matrix Analysis, Complex Symmetric Matrices, and Physically Realizable Systems. ==Publications== * Variable-frequency Oscillator Circuits Possessing Exceptional Stability (1951) * Determination of Equivalent‚ÄêCircuit Constants of Piezoelectric Resonators of Moderately Low Q by Absolute‚ÄêAdmittance Measurements (1954) * Directional Properties of Continuous Plane Radiators with Bizonal Amplitude Shading (1955 with Hickman) * Broad-Band, High-Power, Low-Frequency Variable-Reluctance Projector Array (1956 with Byrnes & Hickman) * Magnetic Materials for Electromagnetic Transducer Applications (1958) * An Investigation of Electroacoustic Reciprocity in the Near Field (1961) * Reciprocity Calibration in the Near Field (1961) * Near Field of a Shaded Radiator (1961) * Vibrations of Longitudinally Polarized Ferroelectric Cylindrical Tubes (1963) * New Standard for Measurements of Certain Piezoelectric Ceramics (1963) * Radiation Impedances of Plane‚ÄêArray Elements (1963) * Velocity Control of Transducer Arrays (1963) * On the Properties of Segmented Ferroelectric Ceramic Systems (1964) * On the Theory of Segmented Electromechanical Systems (1964) * Vibrations of Coaxially Segmented, Longitudinally Polarized Ferroelectric Tubes (1964) * Computer Design of Transducers (1964) * Measurement of the Gross Properties of Large Segmented Ceramic Tubes (1965) * Effects of Static Stress on the Dielectric, Elastic, and Piezoelectric Properties of Ceramics (1965) * Dielectric, Piezoelectric, and Elastic Losses in Longitudinally Polarized Segmented Ceramic Tubes (1965) * On the propagation of longitudinal stress waves in finite solid elastic horns (1967) * Comments on the Possible Resurgence of Magnetostriction Transducers for Large Ship Sonars (1967 with Berlincourt, Schenck & Smith) * Near‚ÄêField and Far‚ÄêField Radiation from an Experimental Electrically Steered Planar Array (1967) * Dielectric, Elastic and Piezoelectric Losses in Piezoelectric Materials (1974) * Vibrations of plates and cylindrical shells in an acoustic medium (1976) * Thirty years' progress in transducer source and receive arrays (1977) * Economical computation of array gain of large lattice acoustic arrays in anisotropic sea noise (1977) * Effects of dissipation in piezoelectric materials: Reminiscence (1980) * Discrete amplitude shading for lobe‚Äêsuppression in discrete array (1982) * The 3‚Äê3 parameters for piezoelectric ceramics: New parameter‚Äêmeasurement relations and transducer design implications (1982 with Johson) * Analysis of intermodal coupling in piezoelectric ceramic rings (1983 with Benthien) * Degradation of angular resolution for eigenvector-eigenvalue (EVEV) high-resolution processors with inadequate estimation of noise coherence (1984) * Analyses of large arrays: Brief theory and some techniques used in 1954‚Äì1985 (1985) * Transducer longitudinal‚Äêvibrator equivalent circuits and related topics (1990) * Limits of dissipative coefficients in piezoelectric transverse isotropic materials (2011) * A New Approach to Matrix Analysis, Complex Symmetric Matrices, and Physically Realizable Systems (2012) == References == Category:21st-century American physicists Category:Amateur radio people Category:People from San Diego Category:1925 births Category:Living people Category:American United Methodists Category:UC Berkeley College of Engineering alumni Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:San Diego State University alumni Category:University of Texas alumni ","title":"Gordon Eugene Martin"},{"id":"42093374","text":"G√∂khan Alsan (born 1 April 1990 in Trabzon, Turkey) is a Turkish footballer who currently plays as a midfielder for Samsunspor.http://www.tff.org/Default.aspx?pageID=30&kisiID;=860084B√ºY√ºK≈ûEHiR‚ÄôiN SON BOMBASI G√ñKHAN ASLAN‚Äö gaziantepgunes.com, 19 August 2016 ==References== Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Association football midfielders Category:Kardemir Karab√ºkspor footballers Category:People from Araklƒ± Category:S√ºper Lig players Category:≈ûanlƒ±urfaspor footballers Category:TFF First League players Category:Trabzonspor footballers Category:Turkish footballers ","title":"G√∂khan Alsan"},{"id":"42093376","text":"The Fife Lake‚ÄìUnion District No. 1 Schoolhouse, also known as the Cedar Creek School of the Union Township Hall, is a school building located at 5020 Fife Lake Road near Fife Lake, Michigan.

It is unique because of the distinctive design of its Late Victorian porch and belfry. ==History== The Fife Lake Schoolhouse was built in 1882 by local carpenter John Dewey. It was used as a school until the early 1950s. In 1955, Union Township purchased the schoolhouse and converted it into a township hall. ==Description== The Fife Lake Schoolhouse is a one-story Late Victorian balloon-frame rectangular structure with a gable roof and clapboard siding. The exterior is generally plain, but the appearance is enhanced by a distinctive triple-bay entry porch with a barrel-vault-top center, and by an open well-house-like belfry. Both the porch and the belfry have stickwork brackets, and the belfry has a gable roof and a central finial. Two entrances lead from the porch into coat rooms, which open onto the main schoolroom. The schoolroom has vertical-board interior paneling and a pressed metal ceiling. A clapboard woodshed with a gable roof is located behind the schoolhouse. ==References== Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Victorian architecture in Michigan Category:School buildings completed in 1882 Category:Buildings and structures in Grand Traverse County, Michigan Category:Michigan State Historic Sites Category:Defunct schools in Michigan Category:Schoolhouses in Michigan Category:National Register of Historic Places in Grand Traverse County, Michigan ","title":"Fife Lake‚ÄìUnion District No. 1 Schoolhouse"},{"id":"42093386","text":"J√∫lia N√©meth (born 4 October 1991 in Veszpr√©m) is a Hungarian football goalkeeper currently playing in the Hungarian First Division for Ferencv√°rosi TC.

It contains the complete concert recorded on December 7, 1995, at the Niagara Falls Convention Center in Niagara Falls, New York. It was released by JEMP Records on November 12, 2013. ==Critical reception== On AllMusic, Thom Jurek said, \\"Given Phish's musical renaissance after their reunion in 2008, revisiting the band's past is often useful for the purpose of hearing just what made them such a dominant force on the early jam band scene in the first place. This date, recorded at the Niagara Falls Convention Center in December of 1995, is a prime example.... The sound captured is simply pristine; the show is top flight.... It's not just Phish's tight command of the material that's so remarkable, but the improvisational interplay that takes place inside an intricate, often knotty set of musical parameters. As evidenced by Niagara Falls, playing and performing like this set the band apart in the early years ‚Äî before they were given to excess bullshitting at the turn of the century. There isn't any of that here; it's all kinetic, and hot, top to bottom.\\" On All About Jazz, Doug Collette wrote, \\"When Phish played the Niagara Falls Convention Center on December 7th 1995, it'd be fair to say the band was hitting its stride with its art and its audience. Having played together for a dozen years at this point and cultivated a loyal and increasingly large coterie of followers, arguably as idiosyncratic as the Vermont-based group itself, the quirks that endeared Phish to their original followers ‚Äî like the barbershop a capella chestnut \\"Hello My Baby\\" ‚Äî were morphing into more broad eccentricities (the second of their ongoing giant chess matches continued here to be completed at year's end) that were proving accessible to a larger fan base.\\" On Live For Live Music, David Melamed said, \\"From a band whose storied career spans three full decades, Niagara Falls captures Phish in their prime, at a point where the band was gaining traction‚Ä¶ selling out large arenas, expanding and refining a diverse repertoire, and building a strong relationship with their consistently-growing fan base.... Niagara Falls captures the musical essence of 1995, 1.0-era Phish. From the experimental space jams, the double a cappella set closers, and the pure bliss of the band's original music, this is one joyous slice of fabled Phish-tory.\\" On AltDaily, David Paul Kleinman wrote, \\"Phish has always been an act extempore, which is something that separates them out from virtually every other act hitting the large venues they do. It's difficult to find an arena act that has even one second that isn't prescripted. It's difficult to find an arena band that isn't playing the exact same songs in the exact same order every night: \\"Thank you, Cleveland... uh, I mean, Baltimore!\\" Phish is the very rare sort of act that performs without a net, and these two sets from a chilly night in upstate New York illustrate the band's widening range of risky moves. It's one thing to experiment with one kind of music per night. It is quite another thing to experiment with several kinds per night.\\" ==Track listing== ;Disc one First set: #\\"The Old Home Place\\" (Mitchell F.

Outside of Hong Kong and China, Wan King Path has gained international media attention due to the name appearing similar to an English- language vulgar slang word for masturbation, wanking. In 2006, it was included in the Rude World: The 100 Rudest Place Names in the World book. The name of the path may have come about when members of the Royal Navy asked members of the local population the local name of locations to make a translation for signs. The residents reportedly would often reply by using names that were intentionally offensive Chinese names or by using puns and incorrect translations. The British government in Hong Kong used these names for places in Hong Kong up until the 1990s when the Geographical Place Names Board was established to correct the erroneous translations. The name of Wan King Path was not changed during this time. After the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, there were concerns that the Special Administrative Region government would change names such as Wan King Path for being viewed as colonial, however Wan King Path's name was not changed. == Buildings == Wan King Path has some banks belonging to the Hong Kong Bank of China and Standard Chartered Hong Kong located along it.

It premiered on March 6, 2015, on Netflix and ran for four seasons, ending on January 25, 2019. An interactive special premiered on May 12, 2020. The series follows 29-year-old Kimmy Schmidt (Kemper) as she adjusts to life after her rescue from a doomsday cult in the fictional town of Durnsville, Indiana, where she and three other women were held by Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne (Jon Hamm) for 15 years. Determined to be seen as something other than a victim and armed only with a positive attitude, Kimmy decides to restart her life by moving to New York City, where she quickly befriends her street-wise landlady Lillian Kaushtupper (Carol Kane), finds a roommate in struggling actor Titus Andromedon (Tituss Burgess), and gains a job as a nanny for the melancholic and out-of-touch socialite Jacqueline Voorhees (Jane Krakowski). Throughout its run, the series received critical acclaim, with critic Scott Meslow calling it \\"the first great sitcom of the streaming era\\". It received a total of twenty Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including four nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series and a nomination for Outstanding Television Movie for the 2020 special: Kimmy vs. the Reverend. == Synopsis == Kimmy Schmidt (Ellie Kemper) was in eighth grade when she was kidnapped by Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne (Jon Hamm). The Reverend held Kimmy and three other women captive for 15 years in an underground bunker and convinced them that a nuclear apocalypse had come, gone, and had left them the sole survivors of humanity. In the first season, the women are rescued, and go on to appear on the Today Show in New York City. After the show, Kimmy decides she does not want to return to Indiana, and does not want to be seen by everyone as a victim, so she starts a new life in New York City. Roaming around the city, Kimmy comes across landlady Lillian Kaushtupper (Carol Kane). Kaushtupper offers Kimmy a chance to room with Titus Andromedon (Tituss Burgess) in her downstairs apartment. However, Kimmy has to find a job in order to get the apartment. Upon attempting to get a job at a nearby candy store, Kimmy sees a boy stealing candy. She pursues him back to his home, and ends up encountering his mother, Jacqueline Voorhees (Jane Krakowski), a Manhattan trophy wife, who mistakes her for a nanny, and whom Kimmy mistakes as someone trapped in a cult. Soon after, Jacqueline hires Kimmy as a nanny for her 10-year-old son. As Season 1 continues, Kimmy falls in love with a Vietnamese man, Dong (Ki Hong Lee) from her G.E.D. class, goes to court to testify against the Reverend, and discovers how the world has changed in the 15 years she was held captive. In the second season, Kimmy is sick of working for Jacqueline and gets a job at a year-round Christmas store and then as an Uber driver. She tries to get over Dong, who enters a green card marriage with another G.E.D. student and is eventually deported. As Kimmy tries to move on, so do Titus and Jacqueline, who both find boyfriends. Titus begins dating construction worker Mikey Politano (Mike Carlsen) and Jacqueline begins dating lawyer Russ Snyder (David Cross). Jacqueline also goes back to her Native American heritage and decides to take down the Washington Redskins, who her boyfriend's father happens to own. Kimmy reunites with Gretchen and Cyndee to save them from joining another cult and getting married on television, respectively. When Season 2 ends, Titus leaves to be a performer on a cruise and Lillian protests the invasion of hipsters in her neighborhood, while Kimmy makes amends with her mother (Lisa Kudrow) after advice from her therapist (Tina Fey) before receiving a phone call from the Reverend in prison, telling her that they need to get a divorce. In the third season, Kimmy proceeds with the divorce from the Reverend but hits a snag when she learns that a devoted fan (guest star Laura Dern) wants to marry him. After getting her G.E.D., Kimmy decides to go to college and ends up at Columbia University, where she is popular but fails academically. She forms a friendship with Perry (Daveed Diggs), a philosophy and religion transfer student who, like Kimmy, doesn't fit in with the rich, elitist Ivy League students. Titus returns from his stint on the cruise harboring a secret, and after seeing Mikey out with another man, breaks up with him. Lillian is elected to the city council and attempts to block the construction of a supermarket chain for fear it will gentrify the neighborhood. She later starts a relationship with the owner of the chain (Peter Riegert). Meanwhile, Jacqueline and Russ execute their plan to force his family to change the name of the Redskins and Titus makes it big with the single \\"Boobs in California\\". At the end of season three, Titus vows to win Mikey back from his new boyfriend, Jacqueline finds a profession, and Kimmy lands a job at a tech start-up. In the fourth and final season, Kimmy is working at Giztoob, the tech company started by a former classmate at Columbia, and Jacqueline is representing Titus as his agent. After refusing to perform sexual acts on a puppet to land a role on Sesame Street, Titus gets a job as director of a school play and, in an attempt to impress Mikey, pretends to write and star in a superhero television show called \\"The Capist,\\" starring Greg Kinnear. Meanwhile, Lillian's boyfriend Artie dies and she is put in charge of his adult children's trust. Kimmy reunites with Donna Maria, who is now a successful businesswoman. Outraged and inspired by men's rights activists, Kimmy writes a children's book that empowers girls and encourages boys to be kind; by the end of season four, Kimmy has found success as a children's author. Season 4 features two episodes that veer from the main plot. In the first, a standalone mockumentary episode, Jacqueline's former boy toy Doug, a.k.a. DJ Fingablast, creates a true crime documentary called Party Monster: Scratching the Surface, which sympathizes with the Reverend and paints Kimmy and the other Mole Women negatively. The second episode, \\"Sliding Van Doors\\", presents an alternate universe in which Kimmy is never kidnapped, Titus does not audition for The Lion King in 1998, Jacqueline does not marry Julian Voorhees, and Lillian runs a Latin street gang. The series concludes with each of the main four characters finding success and purpose in new ventures. ==EpisodesCast and charactersMain=== * Ellie Kemper as Kimberly \\"Kimmy\\" Cougar Schmidt, the titular character. Armed with only unflagging optimism, a childlike sense of wonder and an eighth-grade education, she attempts to regain the life that was taken from her and navigate her way through the unfamiliar struggles of New York life. * Tituss Burgess as Titus Andromedon (born Ronald Wilkerson), Kimmy's flamboyantly gay roommate and an aspiring actor and singer. Melodramatic and self-absorbed, Titus nevertheless cares deeply for, and is very protective of Kimmy. Despite his talent and ego, he is plagued by self-doubt after years of rejection in the business. Titus hails from Chickasaw County, Mississippi, and moved to New York City in 1998. * Carol Kane as Lillian Kaushtupper, Kimmy and Titus' odd landlady. A proud born-and-bred New Yorker with a long, complex criminal history, she fights against the possible gentrification of her neighborhood (although it soon becomes clear that she hates any form of progress or technology). Despite her willingness to do anything to make a buck, she has a very big heart and will go out of her way to help her tenants. * Jane Krakowski as Jacqueline White (formerly Voorhees; n√©e Jackie Lynn White), a wealthy and insecure socialite who hires Kimmy as a nanny. Despite coming across as arrogant, condescending and out of touch, she is very fond of (and heavily reliant on) her new employee, who helps her gain perspective on her unhappy marriage. She is secretly of Lakota Native American descent and is passing for white. As the series progresses, she gradually reconnects with her family and her culture. She is the mother of Buckley Voorhees and the former step-mother of Xanthippe Lannister Voorhees. Her ex-husband is Julian Voorhees. ===Recurring=Guest=ProductionDevelopment=== The show was created by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock when NBC executives asked them to develop a show for Ellie Kemper. Fey stated that they found an \\"innocence\\" about Kemper's face, but also noted there was a \\"strength\\" to it. One idea was for the show to center on Kemper's character waking up from a coma, but this idea was abandoned in favor of the cult-survivor storyline. The show was initially under development for NBC under the title Tooken. However, this was later changed to the current title. Eventually, NBC sold the series to Netflix. Fey has stated that this was in part due to NBC \\"not feeling confident about watching comedies\\". Prior to the network switch, NBC planned to air the series as either a mid-season replacement or as a summer series. The show was sold to Netflix and given a two-season order. On June 13, 2017, the show was renewed for a fourth and final season, with the first 6 episodes premiering on May 30, 2018. The second half was released on January 25, 2019. On May 8, 2019, it was announced the series will return with an interactive special that premiered on May 12, 2020. ===Casting=== Casting announcements for the remaining roles were held in March 2014, with Tituss Burgess cast as the role of Kimmy's roommate, Titus Andromedon. Titus is a talented singer who works odd entertainment jobs such as dressing up like a robot in Times Square or as a singing waiter at a theme restaurant. Also cast was Carol Kane as Kimmy and Titus' landlady, Lillian Kaushtupper. Shortly afterwards, Sara Chase and Lauren Adams joined the series. Chase signed on for the role of Cyndee, Kimmy's closest friend during their years in the cult; Adams was cast in the role of Gretchen, a 10-year member of the cult who believes everything that she is told. Jane Krakowski was later cast in the role of Jacqueline Voorhees, a wealthy Manhattanite who hires Kimmy as a nanny. Megan Dodds was originally cast before she was replaced with Krakowski. ===Music=== The show's theme song, \\"Unbreakable\\", was produced by The Gregory Brothers and written by Jeff Richmond. It is a tribute to The Gregory Brothers' YouTube show Songify the News ‚Äì auto-tuned news interviews that became popular videos. It specifically parodies the mannerisms of Antoine Dodson in the \\"Bed Intruder Song\\". Richmond also wrote \\"Peeno Noir\\", a song performed by character Titus Andromedon during season 1, episode 6 of the series. === Artwork === Artwork for the show's opening sequence was produced by a team at Pentagram that included feminist artist Deva Pardue. ==Reception== The show has been widely acclaimed by television critics, who have praised the writing and cast. ===Season 1=== On Rotten Tomatoes, the first season has a rating of 95%, based on 55 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Blessed with originality and a spot-on performance from Ellie Kemper, The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is as odd as it is hilarious.\\" On Metacritic, the first season has a score of 78 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Scott Meslow of The Week called the series \\"the first great sitcom of the streaming era\\", praising its wit, edge, and feminist tone. Brian Moylan of The Guardian noted that it is \\"the sort of show that could benefit from multiple viewings, because the jokes are so packed in you‚Äôre sure to miss something while laughing.\\" TV Guide named it the \\"best new comedy of 2015\\". IGN reviewer Max Nicholson gave the first season an 8.3 out of 10 'Great' rating, saying \\"Tina Fey and Robert Carlock's Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is another winner in Netflix's original series catalog. Not only is it charming and funny, but it's unabashedly kooky, and Ellie Kemper nails the lead role.\\" The first season was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards. {  - ! Category !!

It's not one representation among a cornucopia of representations; it's the single mainstream representation in years.\\" The Daily Beast stated that when it comes to race, ‚Äúespecially in its portrayal of a key Vietnamese character, the show leaves much to be desired.‚Äù In the wake of the controversy, Tina Fey responded: \\"I feel like we put so much effort into writing and crafting everything, they need to speak for themselves.

The group is referred to as \\"Respectful Asian Portrayals in Entertainment\\", or \\"R.A.P.E\\" for short. The Asian-Americans shown protesting against yellow-face in the episode are conveyed as unlikable buffoons. Actress Anna Akana criticized the use of yellow-face and the R.A.P.E. acronym during her 2016 Asians in Entertainment Key Note speech. Vox reporter Alex Abad- Santos wrote, ‚ÄúThe odd thing about this episode is that it's another Tina Fey project that paints Asian people, specifically Asian women, as crappy characters.

In 1906, the Cape Government Railways acquired a single self-contained Railmotor for low-volume passenger service. The railmotor was a side-tank locomotive with a passenger coach on a single bogie as an integral part of the locomotive itself.Metropolitan Amalgamated Railway Carriage and Wagon Company Ltd drawing no. 12640 ==Manufacturer== A single Railmotor was delivered to the Cape Government Railways (CGR) in 1906. The railmotor was a self-contained motor- coach in which the locomotive and coach were embodied in a single vehicle, with a driver's station at the rear end of the coach for reverse running. The locomotive part was a 0-4-0 side-tank engine which was built by North British Locomotive Company, while the coach part was built by Metropolitan Amalgamated Railway Carriage & Wagon. It was the first steam railmotor to enter service on the CGR and was allocated the number 6, later M6.

To negotiate curves and points, the power unit of the locomotive pivoted like a bogie. ==ServiceCape Government Railways=== The railmotor was intended for low-volume passenger service and was initially placed in service on the Franschhoek branch line. In its later years the railmotor worked a shuttle service between Bellville and Salt River. ===South African Railways=== When the Union of South Africa was established on 31 May 1910, the three Colonial government railways (CGR, Natal Government Railways and Central South African Railways) were united under a single administration to control and administer the railways, ports and harbours of the Union.

This was possibly the reason why the railmotor did not have a long service life and was withdrawn from service in 1918. ==Illustration== The interior layout of the railmotor is illustrated by the Metropolitan Amalgamated Railway Carriage & Wagon drawing of the vehicle.

He won eleven hurdle races and one steeplechase in a thirty-six race career which lasted from February 2001 until July 2006. He recorded his first major win when taking the Swinton Handicap Hurdle at Haydock Park Racecourse in May 2002. He went on to win the John James McManus Memorial Hurdle in Ireland in 2002 and 2003 and the Fighting Fifth Hurdle in 2002. Intersky Falcon's most notable achievement was to record back-to-back victories in the Christmas Hurdle, decisively defeating the reigning Champion Hurdler on each occasion. He never won at Cheltenham, but ran in four consecutive renewals of the Champion Hurdle, finishing fifth, third, sixth and eleventh. ==Background== Intersky Falcon is a chestnut gelding with a narrow white blaze bred by Fulling Mill Farm and Stud. He was probably the best jumper sired by Polar Falcon, an American-bred stallion who won the Lockinge Stakes and the Haydock Sprint Cup in 1991. As a breeding stallion his most influential offspring was Pivotal who won the Nunthorpe Stakes and became a very successful sire. Intersky Falcon's dam, I'll Try was an Irish-bred mare who won one race in England and three in the United States between 1984 and 1986. As a granddaughter of Mortefontaine, she was closely related to the Nunthorpe stakes winner Polyfoto and the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Katies: as a broodmare, I'll Try also produced the Lincoln Handicap winner John Ferneley. In September 1998, the yearling colt was sent to the sales at Doncaster and was bought for 17,500 guineas by the trainer and former jockey Jonjo O'Neill. During his racing career he was owned in partnership by O'Neill's wife Jacqui and Intersky Racing, a syndicate managed by the former international footballer Terry McDermott and whose 27 members included Alan Shearer. He was trained by O'Neill at Penrith in Cumbria before moving to the trainer's new base at Jackdaws Castle in Gloucestershire in 2001. Intersky Falcon usually raced in blinkers and showed a marked preference for fast ground. ==Racing careerEarly career=== Intersky Falcon began his racing career by competing in National Hunt Flat races, also known as \\"bumpers\\" in 2001. He finished third on his debut at Catterick Racecourse in February, second at Ayr in April and second again at Worcester in July. Later in July, he was switched to novice hurdle races and finished third at Stratford-on-Avon Racecourse. On 5 August, Intersky Falcon started 6/5 favourite for a novice hurdle at Market Rasen and recorded his first success. Ridden by the champion jockey A. P. McCoy, he took the lead after the final hurdle and drew away from his twelve opponents to win by seven lengths. Four weeks later he finished second when favourite at the same course but then won minor novice events at Sedgefield Racecourse in September (wearing blinkers for the first time) and November. In the early part of 2002, Intersky Falcon, though still technically a novice, began to compete against more experienced rivals in handicap races. At Doncaster Racecourse in February he carried 152 pounds in a seven-runner handicap in which he was ridden by Liam Cooper and started at odds of 7/2. He led from the start, went clear of the field at the third last hurdle and won by five lengths from Renzo. After finishing sixth behind Latimer's Place at Sandown in March he was sent to Aintree Racecourse in April and started at odds of 10/1 for the Cordon Bleu Handicap Hurdle. Ridden by Cooper, and carrying the minimum weight of 140 pounds, he took the lead approaching the third last hurdle, he quickly went clear of the field and won very easily by fifteen lengths from Idaho d'Ox. The independent Timeform organisation wrote that he won \\"in a manner rarely seen in such a competitive handicap\\". In the weight-for-age Masai Hurdle at Sandown later that month he took the lead 75 yards from the finish but was beaten a short head by the rallying Copeland. On 4 May, Intersky Falcon carried top weight of 164 pounds in the Grade III Swinton Handicap Hurdle at Haydock Park Racecourse. Starting at odds of 11/2 in a field of eleven, he appeared outpaced three hurdles out, but rallied under strong driving from Cooper to take the lead in the closing stages and won by half a length from Granalmo. ===2002/2003 National Hunt season=== In October 2002, Intersky Falcon began the new season with a trip to Ireland where he started 3/1 second favourite for the Grade II John James McManus Memorial Hurdle at Tipperary Racecourse. He went clear of the field four hurdles from the finish and held off the strong challenge of Bob What to win by one and a half lengths, with the favourite In Contrast ten lengths back in third. On 30 November, Intersky Falcon started 11/10 favourite for the Grade II (now Grade I) Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle Racecourse in which his opponents included the 2002 Champion Hurdle runner-up Marble Arch. He tracked the leader Castlehane before Cooper sent him into the lead after the sixth hurdle. In the closing stages he drew away from the field and won \\"very comfortably\\" by six lengths from The French Furze, with Marble Arch eight lengths further back in third place. After the race he was offered at odds of 10/1 for the Champion Hurdle, whilst the Racing Post reported that his official rating had risen by 46 pounds since the start of the year. On Boxing Day, Intersky Falcon faced the reigning Champion Hurdler Hors La Loi III in the Grade I Christmas Hurdle at Kempton Park Racecourse, which also attracted Marble Arch and the dual Grade I-winning Irish challenger Davenport Milenium. Ridden by Charlie Swan, he took the lead at the third hurdle and opened up a six length advantage over his opponents before appearing to tire two hurdles from the finish. At the final obstacle he was joined by the Paul Nicholls- trained outsider Santenay but went clear again on the run-in to win by three lengths. Hors La Loi finished fourth, twenty-two lengths behind the winner. Intersky Falcon was expected to start favourite for the Irish Champion Hurdle at Leopardstown Racecourse in January but was withdrawn after contacting a respiratory infection: according to O'Neill he \\"didn't scope clean\\". On 11 March Intersky Falcon made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival when he started 5/1 third favourite behind Rhinestone Cowboy (also trained by O'Neill) and Rooster Booster for the Champion Hurdle. Before the race, O'Neill expressed the opinion that Intersky Falcon was more likely to win than Rhinestone Cowboy saying that the horse was \\"a complete one-off\\" and adding; \\"The improvement he has made has been amazing. He has got the experience, he is a quicker jumper and he has beaten all the Champion Horses ‚Äì or a lot of them ‚Äì in the trials\\". Cooper sent the gelding into the lead from the start and set a \\"furious pace\\" before being overtaken by Rooster Booster at the second last. He tired in the closing stages and finished fifth of the seventeen runners behind Rooster Booster, Westender, Rhinetone Cowboy and Self Defense. ===2003/2004 National Hunt season=== On his first appearance of the 2003/2004, returned to Tipperary for a second John James McManus Hurdle and started 8/13 favourite against five opponents including the Supreme Novices' Hurdle winner Back In Front and the four-year-old Harchibald. He took the lead from the start and was never seriously challenged, winning by twelve lengths. O'Neill said \\"he is a lovely horse who keeps improving\\" and added that he was \\"a stronger horse\\" than he had been in the previous season. In November he started at odds of 1/2 in his attempt to win a second Fighting Fifth Hurdle despite conceding eight pounds to his seven opponents. He took the lead at the sixth hurdle but after a mistake at the last he was overtaken on the run-in and finished third behind The French Furze and Geos. After the race, Terry McDermott said; \\"We are in a state of shock. It looked a question of how far he was going to win, but when Liam asked him there was nothing there\\". At Kempton Park's Boxing Day meeting, Intersky Falcon was matched against the reigning Champion Hurdler Rooster Booster and the improving four-year-old Sporazene as he attempted to repeat his 2002 success in the Christmas Hurdle. Starting the 11/4 third choice in the betting, he was restrained by Cooper in the early stages before taking the lead from Brooklyn's Gold at the second last. He went clear of the field at the final obstacle and won by two and a half lengths from Rooster Booster. After the race he was made 9/2 second favourite for the Champion Hurdle. Terry McDermott said \\"This is a dream come true, as we had real trepidation after the way he ran at Newcastle. We've beaten a decent Champion Hurdle winner and hope he gets the recognition he deserves now. I'm not going to say he's going to win the Champion, but he must have a bloody good chance\\". Intersky Falcon prepared for his second Champion Hurdle in the Kingwell Hurdle at Wincanton Racecourse in February. Starting the odds-on favourite he took the lead at the third last but was overtaken approaching the last and beaten three and a half lengths by the Bula Hurdle winner Rigmarole. In the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham on 16 March, Intersky Falcon started the 8/1 third favourite behind Rooster Booster (11/8) and Rigamarole (4/1). He was towards the back of the field at the third last hurdle but stayed on well to finish third behind Hardy Eustace and Rooster Booster. In the Aintree Hurdle a month later he finished fourth behind Rhinestone Cowboy, Rooster Booster and Westender, beaten le than two lengths by the winner. On his final appearance of the season he finished fifth behind Hasty Prince (also trained by O'Neill) in the Concept Hurdle at Sandown on 23 April. At the end of the season, the gelding underwent surgery to correct a respiratory problem. ===Later career=== Intersky Falcon remained in training for three more seasons, but failed to recapture his best form. In the 2004/2005 season he ran only three times, finishing fourth to Harchibald in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle, sixth to Hardy Eustace in the Champion Hurdle and eighth to Al Eile in the Aintree Hurdle. In the following year he was more active, but failed to win in seven races. His best results came when he finished second to Royal Shakespeare in the Elite Hurdle and second to Harchibald in the Bula Hurdle. He ran in the Champion Hurdle for a fourth time, finishing eleventh behind Brave Inca as a 66/1 outsider. In 2006, Intersky Falcon was tried over steeplechase fences, making his debut over the larger obstacles at Newton Abbot Racecourse in May. Ridden by McCoy, he made some jumping errors but was not extended and won by twelve lengths from Kings Brook. At Stratford in July he was tailed off in a novice chase when being pulled up by McCoy in what proved to be his final racecourse appearance. ==Retirement== Intersky Falcon's retirement was announced shortly after his run at Stratford, with O'Neill commenting \\"He's been a smashing horse. He's won the Fighting Fifth, the Christmas Hurdle (twice) and we had a great run with him all the time. He didn't really like the fences that much but he's got out in one piece and we're all happy about that\\". McDermott said that the horse had \\"given us the best of our racing days over the past six years. We haven't completely finalised his retirement plan yet, but he deserves a good rest and a good home and he'll get that\\". In November 2009, Intersky Falcon led the pre-race parade for the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle. ==Pedigree== *Intersky Falcon was inbred 3 x 3 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the third generation of his pedigree. ==References== Category:1997 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 7-f ","title":"Intersky Falcon"},{"id":"42093632","text":"Amos Twinomujuni is a former Justice of the Supreme Court of Uganda. ==See also== *Judiciary of Uganda ==References * Parliament Vets Appointed Judges * Who Are the New Judges?

Every zone will de facto be governed by a technical secretary, elected by a committee that will oversee the adoption of best practices. The committee is in its turn appointed by the president of Honduras, in accord with the organic laws that regulate these zones. The inhabitants will be able to interact with each other voluntarily. The ZEDE is not unique. Other successful free trade zones can be found in China (Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Shanghai, Macao), in South Korea (Songdo), and in Singapore. == Objectives == ZEDE has the following objectives for economic development:¬øQue es un ZEDE? (2013-03-03) # International logistics centres that permit the processing of goods at a grand scale (such as the Col√≥n Free Trade Zone in Panam√°). # International business courts that resolve disputes between both national and foreign business entities (such as the Isle of Man, United Kingdom). # Special investment districts that permit the creation of centres for the service sector (such as the Cayman Enterprise City, Cayman Islands). # Districts for renewable energy that permit investment in renewable energy (such as the solar parks in Arizona, United States). # Special economic zones in which the laws that govern the economy will be different from the rest of the country. National laws might be suspended in favor of solutions based on a free market. Compare Shenzhen, China. # Zones subject to a special judicial system that function under a judicial tradition different from the usual (such as the courts in the financial districts of Dubai that are subject to Common Law). # Special agro- industrial zones that permit incentives for exporting high-quality agricultural products (such as the cultivation of asparagus in Peru). # Special tourist zones that permit special conditions for creating centres for tourism in undeveloped parts of the country. == Reception == The ZEDE initiative has gained considerable attention and support from free market advocates, especially from libertarians and supporters of crypto-currencies, who see this as an opportunity to test their ideas in practice. == Projected Impact == Recently, economists at the Universidad Francisco Marroqu√≠n conducted an economic impact analysis examining how ZEDEs might impact the Honduran economy. They found that a ZEDE which resembles the growth rates of China's Special Economic Zones would reach $36,000 GDP per capita by 2050.

He grew up as the oldest child in a family of five, and took a strong interest in music at a young age. While a student at FGC Warri, he engaged himself in rap battles and developed a friendlier relationship with like-minded students, which led to the formation of the hip hop group G-Squad. The group soon began performing at various talent shows in Delta State. Music remained their unmatched and true passion. In a 2012 interview with Thisday news, Yung6ix recalled, \\"My love for music was so deep and I just kept on going till it got to a level they had to accept me for who I am. Funny though, the first song I recorded at school was used with my WAEC lesson fee to pay for the instrumentals and remember always having to trek from school to studio for close to 2 hours or more. It was really tough back then at school too as we weren't allowed to do our thing like we would love to but our passion just kept us going stronger & tougher.\\" After graduating from high school, Onokohwomo relocated to western Nigeria to pursue a career in music and enrolled at Oduduwa University. He derived his stage name Yung6ix from his high school nickname \\"6ixty\\". Shortly after he moved to Lagos, he continued to record music; his song \\"I'm an African\\" captured the attention of A&R; Gbemi Ereku, who signed him to his 411 Entertainment Company in 2009. By 2010, he began to attract media attention after his cover version of \\"Oleku\\" went viral on the internet. He later released \\"So Far Gone\\", featuring P. Fizzy, a single off his Green Light Green mixtape. The song was a freestyle to Wiz Khalifa's \\"This Plane\\". In January 2011, 6ix released \\"Plenty Money\\", another track from the mixtape; an accompanying music video was released shortly after. The song made its official Nigerian radio premiere on the Beat 99.9 FM. On 2 April 2011, Vanguard announced that 411 Entertainment had signed a joint-venture deal with Storm Records. The partnership would help improve Yung6ix's music career. Yung6ix collaborated with Wizkid on \\"Follow Me\\", a track from his debut studio album. Following the release of the song, an accompanying music video was filmed; it was directed by Bobby Boulders. In September 2011, Yung6ix released the fourth track from his Green Light Green project, \\"Oh My Gosh\\", which earned him both \\"Lyricist on the Roll\\" and \\"Best Rap Single\\" nominations at the Headies Awards the following year. Green Light Green was originally slated for an April 2011 release, however, it was finally released on 26 December 2011. The music video for \\"Oh My Gosh\\", which was directed by Bobby Boulders, was released in January 2012. It was filmed in Lagos and Johannesburg, with cameo appearances by Naeto C, Jesse Jagz, DJ Neptune, and P. Fizzy. Yung6ix was among the rappers featured on M.I's Illegal Music 2; M.I subsequently co- signed and nicknamed him the \\"King of the South\\". In May 2012, \\"Picking Things\\", the second single from his debut album was released. The song features fellow ex-label mates Naeto C and E. Kelly. The next month, in an interview with blogger Ogaga Sakpaide, Yung6ix revealed the album's title to be 6ix 'O Clock. He also received a nomination for the \\"Most Promising Act\\" at the 2012 Nigeria Entertainment Awards, but lost to Eva Alordiah. In 2013, Yung6ix floated his imprint \\"Kash Kamp\\" which houses Percy as well as talented producer Otee Beatz. On 4 September 2013, Yung6ix's camp welcomed a hand offered from \\"Trick Billionaire MusiQ\\" for both parties to partner with the end-result of taking Yung6ix and his brand out of Africa and sharing his brilliance with the rest of the world. Yung6ix collaborated with Percy on \\"First Class\\", the third single from his album. He also released a music video for the song which earned him a \\"Best Hip Hop Video\\" nomination at the 2013 Nigerian Music Video Awards. 6ix's debut full-length studio album, 6ix O Clock, was eventually released on 6 February 2014. The 16-track album features guest appearances from Phyno, Percy, Da L.E.S, M.I, Ice Prince, Yemi Alade, YQ, and Wizkid. On 11 August 2019, Yung6ix was signed as the first Ambassador to the fast growing e-commerce firm Patricia, one of the largest traders of Bitcoin and gift cards in West Africa. ==Awards and nominations== { class =\\"\\" - !Year !Event !Prize !Nominated work !Result !Ref - rowspan=\\"3\\"2012 rowspan=\\"1\\"Nigeria Entertainment Awards Most Promising Act    - rowspan=\\"2\\"The Headies 2012 Best Rap Single rowspan=\\"2\\"Oh My Gosh  rowspan=\\"2\\" - Lyricist on the Roll  - rowspan=\\"2\\"2013 rowspan=\\"1\\"Nigeria Music Video Awards Best Hip hop Video First Class   - rowspan=\\"1\\"Abuja Music and Meritorious Award National Act of the Year   rowspan=\\"1\\" } ==DiscographyMixtapes=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of mixtapes, with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:20em;\\"  Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" Green Light Green  * Release: 26 December 2011 * Label: 411 Entertainment/Storm Records * Format: Digital download } ===Studio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of studio albums, with selected details ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:18em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:20em;\\"  Details - ! scope=\\"row\\" 6ix O'Clock High Star  * Release: 6 February 2014 * Label: Kash Kamp / Trick Billionaire MusiQ * Format: CD, Digital download Release: 24 November 2017 Label: KashKamp/Trick Billionaire Music (KKTBM) } TRAPFRO 2020. ==Videography== { !Year !Title !Director !Ref - 2016 This Year   - } ==References *Official Website *Twitter Profile Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Warri Category:21st-century Nigerian musicians Category:Nigerian male rappers Category:People from Delta State Category:21st- century male musicians ","title":"Yung6ix"},{"id":"42093678","text":"Cann in the 1900s Thomas Henry Cann (14 June 1858-6 May 1924), often known as T.

The coffin, deprived of its contents for centuries, was removed from the Mausoleum of Helena at Tor Pignatarra, just outside the walled city of Rome, and ultimately moved to the Vatican museums in the 18th century, and now is in the Sala a Croce Greca of the Pio-Clementine Vatican Museum. The Sarcophagus is carved in the Egyptian porphyry, used only in the finest Byzantine imperial monuments. It is noted that the carved imagery depicts victorious Roman Cavalry riding above captured barbarians. It is unclear if such imagery was intended for the sarcophagus of a highly religious Christian woman, or whether the coffin was repurposed for her burial, though the latter is considered unlikely as Helena, as the Emperor's mother, would likely have held enough esteem as to have had a custom-made coffin.The Metropolitan Museum of Art Guide, (1983) edited by Philippe De Montebello, Kathleen Howard, pages 176-177. ==Sarcophagus of Constantina== Sarcophagus of Constantina, (340 AD) In the same room is the Sarcophagus of Constantina, a second porphyry work that once housed the body of Constantina, daughter of Constantine the Great (died 354).

The concept is named after William Fleetwood Sheppard. Let m_k be the measured kth moment, \\\\hat{\\\\mu}_k the corresponding corrected moment, and c the class interval (bin width). No correction is necessary for the mean (first moment about zero). The first few measured and corrected moments about the mean are then related as follows: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{\\\\mu}_2 &= m_2 - \\\\frac{1}{12} c^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\mu}_3 &= m_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hat{\\\\mu}_4 &= m_4 - \\\\frac{1}{2} m_2c^2 + \\\\frac{7}{240} c^4. \\\\end{align} When the data come from a normally distributed population, then binning and using the midpoint of the bin as the observed value results in an overestimate of the variance. That is why the correction to the variance is negative. The reason why the uncorrected estimate of the variance is an overestimate is that the error is negatively correlated with the observation. For the uniform distribution, the error is uncorrelated with the observation, so a correction should be +c2/12, which is the variance of the error itself rather than ‚àíc2/12. Thus Sheppard's correction is biased in favor of population distributions in which the error is negatively correlated with the observation. The cumulants of the sum of the grouped variable and the uniform variable are the sums of the cumulants. As odd cumulants of a uniform distribution are zero; only even moments are affected. The second and fourth cumulants of the uniform distribution on (‚àí0.5c, 0.5c) are respectively, c2/12 and ‚àíc4/120. The correction to moments can be derived from the relation between cumulants and moments. == References == * * Category:Gaussian function Category:Estimation theory ","title":"Sheppard's correction"},{"id":"42093834","text":"Galenia secunda (onesided galenia) is a plant species native to South Africa but naturalized in Australia (Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania and New South Wales), Spain, and the United States (Florida and New Jersey).Gibbs Russell, G.

He attended the college of St Ignatius in Birkirkara and Capranica College and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He was ordained a priest of the Archdiocese of Malta on 28 October 1905 by Archbishop Pietro Pace of Malta. In 1907, he was appointed secretary to the Apostolic Delegate in the Philippines, Mgr. Ambrose Agius, OSB, and he was present at the 1st Provincial Council of Manila in October 1907. After a few months working in the Apostolic Delegation, he left to work as a missionary among semi-savage pagan tribes. After three years he moved to the United States and settled in Brooklyn. He eventually became an American citizen. Caruana worked in Brooklyn as a parish priest. During World War I he became a chaplain in the United States Armed Forces, serving in the Panama Canal Zone and Puerto Rico until 1919. After the war Caruana became secretary to Dennis Joseph Dougherty, the Archbishop of Philadelphia, who became a cardinal in 1921. On 5 August 1921, Pope Benedict XV appointed Caruana Archbishop of Puerto Rico. He received his episcopal consecration on 28 October 1921 from Cardinal Antonio Vico. On 22 December 1925 Caruana was appointed the Apostolic Delegate to M√©xico and Apostolic Delegate to the Antilles, as well as titular archbishop of Sebastea. Though he planned to make Cuba his residence, he arrived in Mexico in March 1926 just as the government of President Calles launched an anti-Catholic campaign that included enforcement and expansion of the anti-clerical provisions of the Mexican Constitution of 1917. On 15 May the government ordered him to leave, citing his failure to identify himself as a clergyman. On 8 March 1927 he was appointed Apostolic Internuncio to Haiti. On 15 September 1935, Pope Pius XI appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to Cuba. His diplomatic career ended when he was replaced in Cuba on 14 May 1947 by Antonio Taffi.

Portions of the law become effective on October 1, 2013, March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015. The law was struck down as unconstitutional by the Federal Courts due to the inability for patients to grow their own medicine. The new act put forward is the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR). The MMPR program replaces the Marihuana Medical Access Regulations (MMAR), which came into force on 30 July 2001. Prior to a federal injunction, the MMAR program was to end on March 31, 2014. The MMAR program was intended to clearly define the circumstances and the manner in which access to cannabis for medical purposes would be permitted. It contained three main components: authorizations to possess dried cannabis flowers; licences to produce dried cannabis flowers, which include Personal-Use Production Licences and Designated-Person Production Licences; and access to supply of cannabis seeds or dried cannabis flowers. The MMPR was introduced in response to concerns from stakeholders that the MMAR was open to abuse. The MMPR treats cannabis as much as possible like any other narcotic used for medical purposes by creating conditions for a new, commercial industry that is responsible for its production and distribution. According to Health Canada, the regulations \\"will provide access to quality-controlled marihuana for medical purposes, produced under secure and sanitary conditions, to those Canadians who need it, while strengthening the safety of Canadian communities. In addition, the new regulations will also enable more choices of marihuana strains and licensed, commercial suppliers.\\" Under the MMPR, Health Canada maintains a list of authorized licensed producers of medical cannabis. While the MMPR originally only contemplated the sale of dried cannabis flowers, recent amendments allow patients to turn their cannabis into products such as edibles and cannabis oil. The transition from the MMAR to the MMPR program represents a substantial change in direction for the supply and acquisition of medical cannabis in Canada. It has not gone without controversy. The MMAR DPL/PPL Coalition Against Repeal is a coalition of over 6,000 members fighting for the preservation of the MMAR. An exemption was granted by a Federal Court Judge in British Columbia and permits clients who had a valid authorization to possess and/or a production license as of March 21, 2014 to continue to grow until the outcome of a Constitutional Challenge Trial that started in February 2015. http://www.johnconroy.com/mmar.htm In August 2016, Health Canada announced the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (ACMPR) to replace MMPR. The new program incorporates the MMPR with a new personal cultivation regime similar to the former Marihuana Medical Access Regulations (MMAR). ==NotesReferences== Category:Medicinal use of cannabis Category:Pharmaceuticals policy Category:Cannabis law reform in Canada Category:2013 in Canadian law Category:Drug control law in Canada category:2013 in cannabis Category:Regulation in Canada ","title":"Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations"},{"id":"42093983","text":"Oliver \\"Ollie\\" Bridge Garrett (October 14, 1895 ‚Äì November 14, 1979) was the leader of the Boston Police Department's liquor raiding unit during Prohibition. On a police salary of $40.36 a week, Garrett managed to bank more than $122,000, owned a $70,000 farm, a Boston town house, and several cars. In May 1930, he pleaded guilty to charges of extortion and sentenced to two years in Deer Island Prison. ==Early life== Garrett was born October 14, 1895 in Mechanic Falls, Maine. He grew up in Farmington, Maine, where his father ran a hotel. When Garrett was fifteen he ran away to Boston. From 1911 to 1915 he worked as a salesman for a bakery business. From 1915 to 1918 he was a foreman for H. P. Hood & Sons. During World War I he served in the Quartermaster Corps. On October 7, 1921, Garrett's wife Lillian died at the age of 26. On June 17, 1923 he married Florence Harding Reden Woodside, a nurse who had taken care of his first wife. Woodside, who was fourteen his senior, was married twice before. Her first husband died and her second marriage ended in divorce shortly before she married Garrett. At the time of their marriage, Garrett had $28.16, which he withdrew for a honeymoon in Rockland, Massachusetts. ==Boston Police Department== On November 7, 1919, Garrett joined the Boston Police Department. He was assigned to the Charlestown Station as a patrolman. He was later made a liquor officer, then a special officer. Following a transfer to the South End, Garrett was noticed by Captain Charles Reardon, who had him transferred to his liquor squad on June 17, 1923. Garrett was the head of the liquor squad's raiding unit. He led over 25,000 raids, which resulted in 17,000 arrests and the seizure of several million gallons of alcohol. Many of Garrett's raids took place without a warrant and were later found to be unlawful. On September 20, 1925, Police Commissioner Herbert A. Wilson requested that the civil service commission promote Garrett to sergeant based on his excellent work as an alcohol raider. However he was denied the promotion due to his low rating (he was 69th on the list). Despite Garrett's raids, there was still plenty of liquor in Boston. Walter Liggett described bootlegging as \\"the largest and best paying racket\\" in the city and estimated that the people of Boston spent $60 million in illegal alcohol. By 1928 there were 4,000 speakeasies in Boston, including four on the same block as police headquarters. In 1928, Commissioner Wilson conducted a secret investigation into Garrett. He found Garrett's extensive real estate and business holdings as well as his close association with a known bootlegger to be \\"suspicious\\" and \\"highly imprudent\\" but did not believe there was enough evidence to bring charges against him. In February 1929 the owner of the Hotel Ritz claimed that an associate of Garrett's had solicited a bribe from him in exchange for protection from raids. Six months later, Wilson transferred Garrett, stating that Garrett had been in the same position for too long. After finding out about the transfer, Garrett was quoted by several newspapers as saying that he would \\"blow the lid off the Boston Police Department\\". Garrett later denied making this statement and an investigation by commissioner Wilson cleared him. On September 4, 1929, Garrett was scheduled to return from vacation and begin night duty in Beacon Hill. However, before he was to report for his new assignment, Garrett was thrown from a horse while participating in races at the Marshfield Fair and went on sick leave. On September 27, Garrett announced his retirement and requested a disability pension for a skull fracture he suffered in an on-duty car accident two years earlier. Deputy Superintendent James McDevitt and Superintendent Michael H. Crowley opposed the pension, as they could not determine whether Garrett's injuries were sustained in the auto accident or at the Marshfield Fair. However, on October 23, Commissioner Wilson overruled them and granted Garrett a pension. ==Investigations and guilty plea== Senator Joseph J. Mulhern, who had been a critic of the Boston Police Department for many years, attacked Garrett's pension, presenting evidence at a Joint Committee on Rules hearing that Garrett's physician was unable to find evidence of a skull fracture and that Garrett hadn't missed work after the accident. In 1930, the Massachusetts House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee voted to request that the Massachusetts Attorney General investigate Garrett's pension. Attorney General Joseph E. Warner began his investigation into Garrett on March 3, 1930. The inquiry was extended in to all matters connected with his service as a police officer. The investigation uncovered fifteen bank accounts, most of which were in his wife's name. Garrett and/or his wife were found to have possessed a 11.5 acre dairy farm in Hingham, Massachusetts, houses in Allston and Newton, Massachusetts, an apartment in downtown Boston, a horse racing stable, a fleet of automobiles (including a Cadillac, Marmon, and Chrysler), diamonds rings, and expensive wardrobes. Their personal property was valued at $225,000 and their bank balances were over to $100,000. Garrett refused to testify at the inquiry. Warner filed his report with the House on May 1, 1930. He found that between 1925 and 1929, Garrett had taken graft from criminals. He also concluded that Garrett's pension had been fraudulently obtained through the \\"active intervention\\" of Commissioner Wilson, who had requested that the examining physician change his report so that it would allow Wilson to give Garrett a pension instead of discharging him as unfit for duty. On May 2, Boston Mayor James Michael Curley ordered that Garrett's pension be stopped. Warner turned over evidence of Garrett's crimes to district attorney William J. Foley. On May 29, 1930, Garrett, his wife, and a third co-defendant, Lillian V. Hatch, were indicted for his extorting Hotel Ritz owner John F. Sullivan. Garrett was charged with 152 counts of conspiracy, extortion, and receiving gratuities from July 1924 to August 1928. His wife was charged with 23 counts of conspiracy and aiding and abetting the commission of a felony. Hatch charged with 133 counts of conspiracy and aiding and abetting. The weekend before the trial was to begin, Garrett evaded two members of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency hired by Foley and became a fugitive. After five months in hiding, Garrett decided to turn himself in. On December 1, 1930 he returned to Boston and surrendered at the police station in Charlestown. On January 28, 1931, Judge Patrick M. Keating ruled that the six year statute of limitations had passed on one of the indictments and ordered that not guilty verdicts be returned on 100 of the counts against Garrett, 14 of the counts against Mrs. Garrett, and 86 of the counts against Hatch. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining counts after 26 hours of deliberation. A second trial was held in March 1931. This one too ended without a verdict, as after 167 of deliberation, the jury was split 8 to 4 in favor of a conviction for Garrett, 7 to 5 in favor of convicting Hatch, and evenly split on Mrs. Garrett. A third trial was scheduled to begin on May 7, 1931, however Garrett suddenly changed his plea to guilty to avoid putting his wife, who had become ill, through the strain of a third trial. He was sentenced to two years in the Deer Island House of Correction and fined $100. ==Later life== Garrett was released from Deer Island on February 21, 1933. Following his release, Garrett worked briefly as an emcee at a nightclub in Saugus, Massachusetts. However, he was not well-suited for the job and opened a garage. On November 30, 1938, Florence Garrett filed for divorce. However, due to her ill health, the petition was delayed. On March 19, 1939, she collapsed while walking with a friend in Brookline and died. Garrett later married Althea Veasey. On June 10, 1939, their first child, a daughter named Althea was born. The couple had three sons and another daughter. In 1944, Garrett sued the city of Boston for $25,000 in pension and interest. The city's legal department defaulted by failing to answer interrogatories and in November 1949, Garrett was awarded a $19,492 judgement. The city filed a petition to vacate the judgement and in October 1952 Garrett accepted a $4,567 settlement from the city. After receiving the settlement, Garrett and his family moved to Ramona, California. In 1974 they moved to Vancouver, Washington. Garrett died on November 14, 1979 in Yacolt, Washington. He is interred in Vancouver. ==Notes== :1.

He is Professor Emeritus of Computational Medicinal Chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem School of Pharmacy. He holds a PhD in organic chemistry from the Hebrew University. He is the head of the Molecular Modelling and Drug Design unit at the university's Institute for Drug Research. Goldblum was a leader of Peace Now, served as its spokesperson for 20 years, and constructed the Settlements Watch activities of Peace Now. Until 2020, he was on the board of the international council of the New Israel Fund. ==Biography== Amiram Goldblum was born in Rosh Pinna in 1945. He is the son of Professor Natan Goldblum, a senior officer in the Medical Corps of the IDF until 1956 and an Israel Prize recipient (1988) for his lifetime efforts to eradicate viral diseases in Israel, in particular, polimyellitis a. The family was evacuated to Haifa during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. Goldblum's mother Tamar (n√©e Toren) was a member of the Irgun and had been in the Beitar youth movement, being instructed by Eliyahu Meridor (father of Israeli politician and Minister Dan Meridor). Goldblum studied chemistry and physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, as a student of Ernst David Bergmann and of Raphael Mechoulam, and continued postdoc studies in Paris with Bernard Pullman and Alberte Pullman and with Corwin Hansch in Pomona College (California). During the years 1970-1979 he served as a news announcer in Kol Yisrael and as an anchor of classical and jazz music programs on the Israeli Radio. Goldblum joined the Hebrew University in 1979 and became associate professor of Medicinal Chemistry in 1989 and full professor in 2010 and retired in 2015, becoming Professor Emeritus. Goldblum is a member of the Supreme Academic Council of the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance and member of the Supreme Academic Council of the AlQasemi Academy in Baka El Gharbieh Goldblum was married to Israela Weinstein from 1967 until her death in 2006. Goldblum is married to Idit Amihai, head of Museums and Public Galleries departments of Israel's Ministry of Culture and Sports. Goldblum's son, Dan Goldblum, who served in the Israeli Commando Unit, Sayeret Matkal, was badly wounded in the commando's preparative operation (Operation Bramble Bush) to kill Saddam Hussein, on 5 November 1992.. Goldblum's daughter Maya served in Sayeret Matkal following her brother. Goldblum fought in the Yom Kippur war, October 1973, as part of battalion 86 which was attached to armoured Division 460. Goldblum fought with his unit over the Suez Canal, where his unit was fighting inside the Egyptian city of Suez toward the end of the war Battle of Suez. The story of some of Goldblum's actions during that war was published in 2014. ==Scientific career== Goldblum invented an algorithm for solving extremely complex combinatorial problems, called Iterative Stochastic Elimination (ISE). . Goldblum's ISE algorithm is the basis for two Hebrew University science- related companies that expand on his research and discovery of drug candidates, Pepticom, and RebioticsRX, focusing on nanomedicine He won first prize in the contest of the American Chemical Society Computers in Chemistry Division in the ACS meeting, Washington D.C. 2000 for his new algorithm, which was developed together with PhD student Meir Glick. Goldblum was awarded the Kaye Innovation Prize in 2017 for \\"dramatic improvements in drug discovery methods\\". Fraunhofer Institute, the leading European Application oriented research center opened one of its two first project centers, \\"Fraunhofer Project center on Drug discovery and delivery\\" in the labs of Profs. Golomb (drug delivery) and Goldblum (Drug Discovery) at the Institute for Drug Research. Goldblum's research is focused on the discovery of new drugs against SARS-CoV-2, on Cannabinoids and the CNS, obesity, bacterial infections, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease and other research in his lab is focused on PCSK9 inhibitors for lowering LDL, on physiology, on Sugar Substitutes and on new fragrances. Goldblum leads a large theoretical research group at Hebrew University Institute for Drug Research. Among many scientific activities, he organized the first meeting to probe the idea of Israel's participation in SESAME between Professor Joel Sussman from the Weizmann Institute and Professor Herman Winick from Stanford University, who initiated the construction of the International Centre for Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science Applications in the Middle East, which includes Israel, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Jordan, Bahrain, Egypt, Cyprus and the Palestinian Authority, among others. ==Political activism== Goldblum was the spokesperson of Peace Now from 1980 to 2000. He was in the front line of the demonstration when Peace Now protester Emil Grunzweig was murdered. He later identified the incident as a \\"catalyst\\" for greater political activism. Goldblum initiated the Settlements Watch activities of Peace Now in 1990. In 1995, Goldblum, referring to the Israeli cabinet decision to expand the settlements, said, \\"We believe that this decision is going to bring a tremendous clash with the Palestinians.\\" In a 2001 interview after the beginning of the second intifada, Goldblum discussed the name of the organization Peace Now, saying \\"The name is very problematic. Today I would not choose the same name for the movement, but we can't change it now. I find this name extremely difficult and it is even a source of embarrassment for me. I can't even put the movement's sticker on my car.\\" Regarding achieving a long term peace agreement, Goldblum suggested \\"pulling out of the territories unilaterally and begin peace negotiations at a point where occupation no longer exists\\", though he did concede that he would allow for \\"annexing 50% of the settlers\\" including those neighborhoods of Jerusalem over the Green Line such as Gilo and Har Homa. In addition, Goldblum said he was opposed to the right of return. In discussing Israel's security, he recommended \\"an airtight security closure, a creation of a 310-kilometer security fence along the Green Line, an airtight closing of the border between Jordan and the Palestinian territory, between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, and of the Mediterranean. This closure would be so complete that is would allow us to inspect every mouse entering Israel\\". Among other issues, Goldblum said \\"... What is really important to me is that this should be the state of the Jews, not a mixed state and not a state of all its citizens....\\" In October 2012, Goldblum and his family foundation, the Yisraela Fund paid for and were involved (along with other Israeli academics) in commissioning a controversial poll regarding Israeli attitudes towards prejudice, along with Mordechai Bar- On, Ilan Baruch, Alon Liel, and Michael Sfard. In a press release of the commissioning group, sent by Goldblum, it was stated, \\"a large part of the Jewish population (58%) accepts the application of the term 'apartheid' to the current state of affairs in Israel. It is, however, not clear what these respondents understand by the term as this question did not require clarification.\\" Goldblum also acknowledged there were problems with a question used on the poll. Israeli statistician Camil Fuchs, who supervised the company that conducted the poll, told The Times of Israel that the questions in the poll were fine and did not need changing by the Dialog team. Miller adds: \\"It is, however, not clear what these respondents understand by the term as this question did not require clarification.\\" In January 2013 Goldblum was #87 on the candidates list of Meretz, for the Knesset elections. Goldblum no. 87 on the MERETZ list to the 19th Knesset In February 2013, Goldblum was one of the organizers of a gathering at the Van Leer Institute in Jerusalem which discussed apartheid in the Israeli context. A new NGO, 'The Organization for the Prevention of Apartheid in Israel', was established to expose and fight against trends of racism and apartheid in Israel. Goldblum writes frequently articles to the press, mainly to Haaretz and has a blog named \\"Knockout from the left\\". Goldblum is a strong critic of the right wing and of the Jewish settlers on the West Bank and of their Evangelical supporters in the U.S. Goldblum accuses Benjamin Netanyahu of being the main public figure who incited to murder Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and believes that Israel has two Jewish people who only have the Hebrew language in common and nothing else. Goldblum believes that Yitzhak Rabin could be saved had he expelled the settlers of Hebron immediately after the Cave of the Patriarchs massacre. Goldblum is one of the main opponents of Ariel University and calls it an \\"apartheid university\\" Due to his political views, Goldblum decided in April 2020 to leave the International Council of the New Israel Fund saying that he \\"left in order to be free and independent, in order not to attribute to NIF anything that I say which is different than what NIF says\\". New Israel Fund denied a report on Makor Rishon claiming that \\"NIF dissociated itself from Goldblum in the wake of his derogatory remarks about Israeli settlers and right wing figures\\". NIF reacted by declaring that \\"Contrary to what is said in this report, NIF did not take any steps against Prof. Goldblum, Goldblum was not rejected from the International Council, NIF did not dissociate itself from him and did not request to do so. As Goldblum said, he requested to leave on his own will.
