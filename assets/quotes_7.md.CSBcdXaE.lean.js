Jones was born in Shrewsbury, Shropshire and educated at Wrekin College.Published under Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians. Jones made his first-class debut against Oxford University at The University Parks in late May 1976. Although he made only 10 and 4 from number two in the order, he was retained for the County Championship match which immediately followed. In this game, now batting at seven, he did no better, making only 11 and 1. After this, Jones spent a long period out of the first team, returning only in August when he was given a short run but again made no significant scores. During the 1977 season, Jones played in the First XI more than at any other time, turning out for 14 first-class and six List A games. In late August he finally made his maiden fifty, hitting 65 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston. Wisden thought he had made \\"a steady advance\\" over the summer, \\"Worcestershire in 1977\\". Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1978, 587. but statistically his season as a whole was disappointing as he averaged only 16.31 in first-class cricket and 8.80 in the one-day game. From 1978 to 1980, Jones was in and out of the Worcestershire side, often getting chances but never managing a really big score. Indeed, he was to score only one half- century in 26 first-class games during that period, an innings of 61 against Oxford University in June 1978. His most eye-catching achievement came in a Second XI match, when he hit a century in each innings versus Somerset II in August 1979. Jones' career in top-class cricket ended after the 1980 season, and he returned to his family's farm in Shropshire.The Cricketer, November 1980, p. 38. He played minor counties cricket with Shropshire in 1981 and 1982, and since 2006 he has made numerous appearances for Shropshire's Over-50s team. He has played at club level for Wroxeter. His brother Bryan Jones made 20 List A appearances for Shropshire and played one Youth Test for England.

It was named after the colloquial name of the Bodleian Library, where it has been stored since the 17th century.Maarten Jansen, Gabina Aurora Perez Jimenez (2005) \\"Codex Bodley: A Painted Chronicle from the Mixtec Highlands, Mexico\\", History While the exact date of its creation is difficult to establish, judging from its content and style, it was completed before the 1521 Spanish conquest of Mexico. The history of the Codex Bodley before becoming part of the Bodleian Library's collection at the beginning of the 17th century is not known. J. Eric Thompson, British archaeologist and Mayan expert, has suggested that the manuscript's previous owner was Bishop Heronymous Osorius of Faro, Portugal. The codex may have been looted by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, and given to his friend Thomas Bodley in the sixteenth century. The Bodleian Library holds four other Mesoamerican codices: Codex Laud, Codex Mendoza, Codex Selden and the Selden Roll. Description The codex is made of deerskin that is 6.7 metres or 22 feet long. The animal skin was folded accordion style to form the distinct pages. Each page was then covered with a white base paint coat and then divided with red bands that extend horizontally. The obverse has five bands while the reverse is only divided into four. The condition of the codex has faded over time with many of the pages missing parts of the pictography. Reading the codex The manuscript can be read from right to left on two sides; the obverse and the reverse. The obverse consists of pages 1 through 20 while the reverse starts on page 40 and finishes on page 21. The obverse ends with a genealogy and names Lord Four Deer as the last lord of the Tilantongo dynasty. On the other hand, Page 21 of the reverse names Lord Eight Grass as being the last king of Tiaxiaco. Eight Grass's name-glyph is at bottom center, above the 9-Deer glyph (photo). Genealogy The Codex Bodley offers a relatively complete review of family relationships among the dynasties of the main cacicazgos (community kingdoms) in the Mixteca Alta region. This information is indispensable for anyone studying Mixtec kinship, policies around marital alliances, and peer polity interaction.Jansen, Maarten E. R. G. N (2001). \\"Bodley, Codex.\\" In Dav√≠d Carrasco The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures. : New York : Oxford University Press. Academic interest in the codex has focused on the Tilantongo and Tiaxiaco dynasties depicted on both sides of the manuscript, who once lived in the modern day Mexican State of Oaxaca. In 1949, the archaeologist Alfonso Caso was able to determine the primary line of descent for the royal family of Tilantongo and how the family affected Teozacoalco after the creation sagas that are described in the story of War of Heaven and Eight Deer stories. The Tilantongo people had an isolated past but the story of Eight Deer story provides a direct connection to the highest ranked dynasty in Mixteca. The reverse of the Codex Bodley tells the story from a different angle. It starts off by describing Apoala as a creation place (in contrast to Achiutla in the obverse). It goes on to describe the royal house of the Red and White Bundle after the War of Heaven. This is the rival family to the Tilantongo. Four Wind's biography is then used to connect a remote past that the family of the Red and White Bundle had to the promising future of Tiaxiaco.

He began dancing on Broadway in such shows as Make Mine Manhattan but soon began choreographing for television with Stop the Music in 1949. Charmoli then choreographed dance sequences for the popular Your Hit Parade, winning his first Emmy Award in 1956. He went on to direct and choreograph for some of the biggest stars including Dinah Shore, Lily Tomlin, Danny Kaye, Julie Andrews, Cyd Charisse, Shirley MacLaine, Mitzi Gaynor, and others. On Broadway, Tony choreographed Ankles Aweigh (1955) and Woman of the Year (1981) with Lauren Bacall. Over his career, he was nominated for fifteen Emmy awards and won three. Early life Charmoli was born in 1921 in Mountain Iron, Minnesota as the youngest of nine siblings. His parents had immigrated from Italy. When he was 16 years old, he traveled alone by bus to Jacob's Pillow in Becket, Massachusetts in order to intern as a dancer for the summer. The next year, on Valentine's Day, he met Wilford Saunders, who was to become his life partner and business manager. Charmoli and Saunders each enlisted in the military during World War II. Charmoli was an operations officer in the 43rd Fighter Squadron in the U.S. Air Force in Panama and organized entertainment shows for them, while Saunders was sent to Europe and became a secretary to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. Career In 1947, he performed on Broadway for the first time, in the production ‚ÄúDear Judas‚Äù. He also choreographed ‚ÄúEddie Fisher at the Winter Garden‚Äù in 1962, as well as Shirley MacLaine‚Äôs Broadway revue in 1976. In 1948, Charmoli danced in ‚ÄúMake Mine Manhattan‚Äù, but gave the part to Bob Fosse when the show toured nationally. Charmoli found Fosse work as a dancer on the TV shows he was working on when Fosse returned from the tour. Charmoli worked in 1949 as choreographer on ABC television‚Äôs ‚ÄúStop the Music.\\" He then joined NBC-TV's ‚ÄúYour Hit Parade‚Äù in 1950, and in 1956 won his first Emmy, for his work on the show. He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to take a position on Dinah Shore's television variety program. At that time, Charmoli continued to work on directing for television, where he directed programs as the famous 1977 production of The Nutcracker starring Mikhail Baryshnikov,Der Nussknacker Ballett von Tschaikowsky (1977), YouTube which was nominated for two Emmys (neither nomination was for Charmoli, however). He directed and choreographed nearly all of Mitzi Gaynor's television specials in the 1970s as well as two of Shirley MacLaine's. He also worked many times with Sid and Marty Krofft, directing all seventeen episodes of Lidsville and The Bugaloos, respectively, as well as their TV special Fol-de-Rol.Sid & Marty Krofft present Fol-de-Rol (1971 Unsold TV Pilot), YouTube He directed the first two years of Star Search (1984‚Äì85), and several years of Circus of the Stars, as well as John Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together (1979),John Denver and The Muppets - A Christmas Together (1979), YouTube winning the Directors Guild Award. Charmoli also directed several Bob Hope specials, more than twenty televised beauty pageants,http://www.inbaseline.com/person.aspx?view=TVCredits&person;_id=257976 and the short-lived summer replacement series The Keane Brothers Show (1977). He was the recipient of three Emmy Awards, plus twelve other Emmy nominations. His second win was in 1974 for ‚ÄúMitzi ... A Tribute to the American Housewife‚Äù starring Mitzi Gaynor; the final one was for Shirley McLaine‚Äôs 1976 show ‚ÄúGypsy In My Soul‚Äù (for which he also won the Director‚Äôs Guild of America award). Other performers he collaborated with included Beyonc√©, LeAnn Rimes, and Justin Timberlake. In 2016, he teamed with Paul Manchester to compose his biography called ‚Äò‚ÄôStars in My Eyes‚Äô‚Äô. Charmoli died in August 2020 at his home in the Hollywood Hills at the age of 99. His partner Saunders died in 1999. Charmoli is considered one of the top television choreographers in history. He felt the television cameras needed to be just as involved with choreography as the dancers, so he always took time to block those as well.

He made more than 400 appearances during his 15 years at West Bromwich Albion. He also won five England caps. Career Born in Widnes, the first child of James and Agnes Magee, Tommy Magee attended St Mary's School. After playing rugby league for Appleton Hornets and St Helens Recs, he switched to football, playing for Widnes Athletic as an amateur during 1914‚Äì1915. He signed a contract with West Bromwich Albion while in the trenches of the First World War in 1918 and scored in his first match, helping Albion to a 3‚Äì1 victory against Derby County in the Midland Victory League in April 1919. Following the end of the First World War, The Football League resumed for the 1919‚Äì20 season, and Magee made his league d√©but on the opening day of the campaign, against Oldham Athletic. In the following match, away at Newcastle United, he scored his first goal for the club. Albion went on to win the First Division that season, the only time in the club's history that they have been champions of England. Magee made a significant contribution, appearing in 24 out of 42 league games and scoring seven goals. Although the next few seasons were less successful for Albion, Magee nonetheless won five caps for England during the 1920s. He made his international d√©but against Wales on 5 March 1923, while his last cap was won two years later against France. Albion did manage another title challenge in 1924‚Äì25, when they finished as runners-up to Huddersfield Town. Magee played in all but two of the club's league matches during the season.McOwan p. 222. In 1926‚Äì27 he was the only West Bromwich Albion player to appear in all 42 league matches, but the club were relegated to Division Two in 22nd (last) position.McOwan p. 224. He won a winners' medal with Albion when they beat Birmingham 2‚Äì1 in the 1931 FA Cup Final, and a few days later was part of the team that secured promotion as Second Division runners-up. As of October 2019, he remains the only Albion player to have won both a League Championship medal and an FA Cup winners' medal with the club. Magee was married to Elizabeth, with whom he had two daughters. Elizabeth died of a brain haemorrhage in February 1932, aged 33. At just 5 ft 2¬Ω ins tall, Magee was the smallest ever player to appear for West Bromwich Albion's first team. His short stature earned him nicknames such as \\"Wee Tommy\\", \\"Pocket Hercules\\" and the \\"Mighty Atom\\".

Geography  Bulwer is on the north-west coast of Moreton Island facing Moreton Bay It is to the Brisbane central business district. It is one of the few developed areas on Moreton Island which is almost entirely national park (Moreton Island National Park). It consists of a few streets of housing and a long sandy beach. There are no formal road connections to Bulwer, but there are dirt tracks that connect it to other parts of the island.  History  James Palmer, pilot station keeper at the pilot station house at Bulwer, 1908 Bulwer was probably named after Lord Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873) who was Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1858 to 1859. The British Colonial Secretary separated Queensland from New South Wales in 1859 and made Sir George Bowen its first Governor. In August 1848, the maritime pilot station on Moreton Bay was moved from Amity Point on the northerly tip of North Stradbroke Island to Bulwer. In 1863 land was offered for sale at Bulwer for the first time, contesting of 36 lots each of 2 roods with 25 sold. Cricket match at Bulwer State School, Queensland, 1899. Group of children playing cricket in the grounds of Bulwer State School, on Moreton Island, in 1899. The teacher's residence is next to the school. In November 1865 a school and teacher's residence were erected but a teacher had not been appointed. The families of the staff of the pilot station were the principal residents at that time. That school opened in 1866-1867. In April 1875, the Queensland Government set aside 2 roods for a government school (suggesting the previous school was operated privately). Moreton Island State School opened circa 1876 and was renamed Bulwer State School in 1878. In 1891 it was downgraded to a provisional school, but restored to state school status in 1895. Landing a boat at Bulwer, 1906 In November 1909 it was decided that the pilots and their families would live in Brisbane, with the pilots being based on a steamer in the Yellow Patch (the part of Moreton Bay to the north of Moreton Island near the entrance to the shipping channel to Brisbane) when on duty; the pilots approved the plan. The state school was closed in 1909 when the pilots' families ceased to live on the island. In the 1930s, three ships were scuttled in the area to form a harbour for small boats. The first on 8 May 1933 was the 337-ton steamer Hopewell formerly owned by timber merchants Hyne & Son of Maryborough. The second on 10 May 1933 was the 716-ton Mount Kembla. The third in September 1935 was the Kallatina, a 646 ton passenger and cargo ship owned by John Edward Burke which operated a route from Brisbane through to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Although the intention was to provide a safe harbour, during a storm in July 1938 the 35-foot motor launch Achilles struck the half-sunken Mount Kembla and sank within 15 minutes, the 12 men on board Achilles climbed onto the Mount Kembla until they were rescued by Robert Alexander Gow in his dinghy. At the 2006 census, Bulwer had a population of 70.  Transport  Bulwer is accessible from Brisbane on the mainland via the Micat Barge service. It is one of the main access points for visitors to the island, 98% of which is in the Moreton Island National Park.  Facilities  Facilities at Bulwer include a helipad and first aid station as well as holiday accommodation, a general store and public phone.

Center for Humanities, 518 U.S. 415 (1996), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court further refined the Erie doctrine regarding when and how federal courts are to apply state law in cases brought under diversity jurisdiction. The Court held that the New York state rule applied. Background of the case The plaintiff, William Gasperini, was an American journalist and photographer for CBS News and the Christian Science Monitor who, during the course of seven years in Central America, took over 5,000 slide transparencies depicting war, political leaders and everyday life. In 1990, Gasperini supplied 300 of his original transparencies to The Center for Humanities for use in an educational video. The center agreed to return the transparencies, but they were lost. Gasperini commenced suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, invoking diversity jurisdiction. The trial jury applied New York law and found for Gasperini, awarding him $450,000 in compensatory damages. The defendant moved for a new trial, asserting, among other things, excessiveness of the award. The district court dismissed the motion and the defendant appealed. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the judgment and remanded for a new trial, unless the plaintiff accepted a remittitur for $100,000. Gasperini petitioned and the Supreme Court granted certiorari. Issue The case involved an important issue of what standard of review should be used by a federal court in measuring the excessiveness of a jury verdict. The standard typically applied by federal courts was that a verdict was excessive if it \\"shocked the conscience of the court.\\" New York had recently enacted legislation changing the standard as a part of a tort reform initiative, codifying in CPLR ¬ß5501(c) the standard that an award was excessive if it \\"deviates materially from what would be reasonable compensation.\\" The question arose as to whether the standard was substantive or procedural, as the Erie Doctrine stipulated that the federal court should apply the substantive law of the state and federal procedural law. The court's decision Justice Ginsburg delivered the majority opinion of the Court, which held that the federal district court should apply the New York standard for excessiveness, reasoning that the case did not include a distinct choice between federal and state interests, but rather presented an opportunity to serve both interests. The federal interest lay primarily in discharging the Seventh Amendment, which precludes review of facts tried by a jury. The Second Circuit had reviewed the verdict against the New York excessiveness standard and thus ran afoul of the Seventh Amendment. Accordingly, the Court vacated the judgment of the Second Circuit and ordered the case remanded to the district court for a new trial so that the trial judge could test the jury's verdict against the state standard.

A Republican, he has served in the Virginia House of Delegates since 1990, representing the 66th District, made up of the southern Richmond suburb of Colonial Heights and nearby parts of Chesterfield County. He also served as the 55th Speaker of the House of Delegates. Previously, Cox had been House Majority Leader (from 2010 to 2018), and House Majority Whip (from 2004 to 2010). In October 2020, Cox filed papers to establish a campaign committee preparing to run for the Republican nomination for Governor of Virginia, but said he would not formally announce until after the November presidential election.\\"Ex-House Speaker files papers to run for Governor,\\" Virginia Lawyers Weekly Oct. 12, 2020 p. 5 Early life and education Born in Petersburg, Virginia, Cox graduated from Colonial Heights High School in 1975. After studying political science and social science at James Madison University, he graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BS) in both fields of study in 1979. He pledged with Theta Chi at James Madison University. Cox received an Associate of Science (AS) in Life Science from the Richard Bland College at the College of William & Mary in 1981. \\"After graduating from Richard Bland College of William & Mary in 1981, Delegate Kirk Cox earned his BS degree from James Madison University.\\" Political career Kirk Cox was first elected from the 66th District to the House of Delegates in 1989. The 66th House District includes all of Colonial Heights and parts of Chesterfield County. In 2017, legislation successfully patroned by Cox resulted in the establishment of the Online Virginia Network (OVN). OVN is an online consortium that offers degrees in high demand fields from Virginia public universities. The program began with two universities participating‚ÄîGeorge Mason University and Old Dominion University‚Äîand has since expanded to include the Virginia Community College System. On January 10, 2018, Cox was unanimously elected as Speaker of the House by the members of the House of Delegates. Upon being sworn in, he became the first Speaker in state history from Colonial Heights, the first Speaker to represent a portion of Chesterfield County since the 1800s, and the first Speaker whose profession was that of a public school teacher. On February 5, 2019, Cox helped the Virginia House of Delegates pass House Bill 2577 to lift the age cap for autism coverage, which helped approximately 10,000 people in Virginia get access to the healthcare they need. Many of these children are not diagnosed until they are already six or seven years of age and need access to important care for longer than just three or four years. No other prevalent health condition‚Äîincluding asthma, diabetes and cancer‚Äîhas coverage limits that are imposed based on the patient‚Äôs age. Coverage for all other health conditions is based on medical necessity. In June 2019, judges declared the House of Delegates' district map illegal due to racial gerrymandering, and imposed a new map. Republican members of the House of Delegates drew the old map in 2011. Cox has opposed the court's ruling, conceding that the map had been drawn to gain political advantage, but not to suppress voters based on race. District 66, represented by Cox, is among the districts that underwent substantial redistricting. In July 2019, Cox formally closed a special session on gun control after 1 hour and 30 minutes of deliberation between fellow delegates. Governor Ralph Northam called for the session after the shooting at Virginia Beach, and Cox adjourned the session with no actions taken. In the 2019 election, Cox was re-elected to a 16th term, but the Republicans lost their majority. He relinquished the role of Speaker to Democrat Eileen Filler- Corn on January 8, 2020. Personal life Cox and his wife Julie reside in Colonial Heights, Virginia. They have four sons: Lane, Carter, Blake, and Cameron. Cox taught government at Manchester High School in Chesterfield County until his retirement in 2012. Electoral history {  - ! Date !! Election !! Candidate !! Party !!

A son of Samuel Jr. was George (born 1794 in Keene, New Hampshire), the father of this sketch.Richmond, p. 107-109 Dinsmoor received a minimal education in the local common schools of Elk township in Warren County, Pennsylvania when he was growing up. Much of his time was spent helping support the large family living in meager circumstances. At sixteen Dinsmoor left home and became a successful student at the academies at Warren, Smethport, and Coudersport, Pennsylvania. He was also a student at Randolph, New York. Dinsmoor was in the printing business for about eleven years in the same cities. The printing was associated with teaching and attending school. During the last three of this time he was editor of the \\"Warren Ledger\\" at Warren, Pennsylvania. Mid life When Dinsmoor was twenty-two he attended Randolph Academy for a year. Here studied law for six months at the offices of Weeden & Henderson. Dinsmoor then continued his law studies under B. W. Lacy in 1858. He was admitted to the bar of Warren County, PennsylvaniaCooper, p. 327-328 September 18, 1859. Dinsmoor was appointed assistant United States marshal in 1860. One of Dinsmoor‚Äôs duties was taking the 1860 census for the northern half of Warren county. Dinsmoor was elected justice of the peace for Warren County in 1861 and was successively reelected for fifteen years. He also practiced law during time. In 1876 he voluntarily retired from the office. Dinsmoor has been elected to many positions in government, from being a town clerk to a chief burgess. In 1878 he was elected to the office of school director and held that position for many years.Warren Ledger newspaper article School Director, Friday January 6, 1893. Page 4, column 4 Dinsmoor contributed much to bring about high quality standards for the schools of Warren. He was for several years the treasurer of Struthers Library Association and a member of its Board of Control. Dinsmoor was a lawyer in the Supreme Court of the state of Pennsylvania and the United States Circuit and District Courts. Dinsmoor has been associated with the order of Odd Fellows from 1868 for many years and was grand master of Warren Lodge No. 339. Later life Dinsmoor practiced law without a partner for many years. Later he became associated with James Cable and formed the partnership Dinsmoor & Cable. Later when Cable died the firm's name changed to Dinsmoor & Peterson. After Peterson died Dinsmoor conducted business by himself for several years until his health failed. The last five years of his life he had failing health until he died April 11, 1904. Notability History records that Dinsmoor invented the endless chain tractor in 1886, a forerunner of the continuous track vehicle.Scientific American, The object of the invention here illustrated is to obviate, as far as possible, the jolt, friction, and difficulty of propulsion inherent in that class of vehicles having for their running gear wheels and axles, to dispense with springs, and to obtain a smooth and easy movement of the vehicle. The endless tracks are composed mainly of anti-friction rollers, united by links to form an endless chain, as shown in Fig. 2. The side pieces of the body of the vehicle are oblong in form, are held parallel with each other by suitable framework, and are flanged to form guides for the wheels of the endless tracks, so that all danger of lateral displacement of the tracks is obviated. The guards surrounding the wheels are made up of links of sheet metal, shaped as clearly shown in the perspective view, and hinged together to for a continuous chain to enclose the wheels. As the vehicle is drawn along the ground, the contact of the endless guards with the ground will cause the body to be drawn along the endless tracks, as it were, upon the oblong side pieces, the latter running upon the rollers. The tracks at the same time pass around the side pieces, over which they run with but little friction, thereby producing easy running, and, owing to the broad surface in contact with the ground, easy riding. This invention has been patented by Mr. Charles Dinsmoor of Warren, Pa. He received patent No. 351,749 on November 2, 1886. \\"Dinsmoor's vehicle\\" was first manufactured commercially by Holt Manufacturing Company of Stockton, California in 1906.Kane, p. 47 The first endless chain tractor was invented by Charles Dinsmoor of Warren, Pa., who obtained patent No. 351,749 November 2, 1886, on a \\"vehicle.\\" The endless chain tractor, or track-type tractor, did not become a commercial and practical reality until Benjamin Holt of the Holt Manufacturing Company of Stockton, Calif., produced such a tractor in 1906 and proceeded to build and sell them in quantities.

The position of Minister for Justice is currently Naomi Long. The department's Permanent Secretary is Peter May. It combines the previous work of the Northern Ireland Office and the Ministry of Justice, within the United Kingdom Government, which were respectively responsible for justice policy and the administration of courts in Northern Ireland. History The partition of Ireland created a separate jurisdiction of Northern Ireland in June 1921. A local Ministry of Home Affairs, initially led by Dawson Bates, was established at that time and oversaw most aspects of justice policy until the introduction of direct rule in March 1972. The Northern Ireland Office, led by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, was subsequently responsible for security and political affairs during the remainder of the Troubles. The post of Lord Chancellor of Ireland was abolished in 1922 and subsequently replaced in Northern Ireland by the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. His supporting department and the subsequent Department for Constitutional Affairs (2003‚Äì2007) oversaw the courts until the formation of the Ministry of Justice in May 2007. Most aspects of social and economic policy were devolved to the Northern Ireland Executive in December 1999. The devolution of policing and justice was pledged in the St Andrews Agreement (of October 2006) and the Hillsborough Castle Agreement (of February 2010) and occurred in April 2010. In October 2018, the department launched the \\"Ending the Harm\\" campaign to end paramilitary punishment attacks, a form of vigilante justice by paramilitary groups that continues after the Troubles. Minister The Minister of Justice is elected by a cross-community vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly,Section 21A(3A), Northern Ireland Act 1998 (as amended) unlike all other Northern Ireland Executive posts, which are either allocated by the d'Hondt method or appointed directly by the largest parties (i.e. the First MinisterSection 16A(4), Northern Ireland Act 1998 (as amended) and the deputy First MinisterSection 16A(5), Northern Ireland Act 1998 (as amended)). The exception was made to resolve a dispute between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn F√©in. The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland successfully nominated its party leader, David Ford, on 12 April 2010. Ford was re-elected to the position on 16 May 2011 and was Minister until 2016. Northern Ireland Executive On 25 May 2016, independent unionist Claire Sugden was elected the new Minister of Justice, following the Alliance Party's refusal of the justice ministry. Sugden's tenure as minister ended on 26 January 2017, when the Northern Ireland Executive was dissolved following further disputes between the DUP and Sinn F√©in. {  style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\\" - bgcolor=cccccc ! !!Minister!!Image!!Party!!Took office!!Left office -  style=\\"background:\\"   David Ford  60px   12 April 2010  6 May 2016 -  style=\\"background:\\"   Claire Sugden  60px   25 May 2016  26 January 2017 -  style=\\"background:\\"   Naomi Long Naomi Long   11 January 2020  incumbent } Aim Under the Programme for Government for 2016‚Äì2020, the department has been tasked with the outcome of \\"a safe community where we respect the law, and each other‚Äù. Its objectives are based on the concept of 'problem-solving justice' which seeks to drive forward \\"new and more imaginative\\" strategies, which will seek to address the underlying causes of offending behaviour. Structure The Department of Justice's headquarters is located in Castle Buildings in Belfast. Its remit includes the following executive agencies: * the Northern Ireland Prison Service * the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service * the Legal Services Agency for Northern Ireland * the Youth Justice Agency * Forensic Science Northern Ireland The department also oversees the following non-departmental public bodies: * the Northern Ireland Policing Board * the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland * the Probation Board for Northern Ireland * Criminal Justice Inspection Northern Ireland * the Northern Ireland Law Commission (non-operational since April 2015) * the Northern Ireland Police Fund * the Royal Ulster Constabulary George Cross Foundation * the Police Rehabilitation and Retraining Trust Advisory * the Advisory Committee on Justices of the Peace The Police Service of Northern Ireland is operationally independent and accountable to the Northern Ireland Policing Board; the Minister of Justice has overall responsibility for legislation on policing. Responsibilities The Department of Justice is responsible for most everyday policing and justice powers in Northern Ireland. In 2009, responsibility for Interfaces Areas and Peacewalls passed from the Northern Ireland Office to the Minister of Justice. As such, the Department of Justice is responsible for the policy of 'removal of all peacewalls in Northern Ireland by 2023'. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 (Devolution of Policing and Justice Functions) Order 2010 outlines the policy areas transferred to the Northern Ireland Assembly. These include: * criminal law * policing * prosecution * public order * courts * prisons and probation * criminal history disclosure (the AccessNI service) Some justice matters remain reserved to Westminster, with the Assembly's agreement e.g. the prerogative of mercy in terrorism cases, illicit drug classification, the National Crime Agency, the accommodation of prisoners in separated conditions within the Northern Ireland Prison Service, parades and the security of explosives. In addition, some justice matters remain excepted and devolution was either not discussed or not considered feasible: extradition (as an international relations matter), military justice (as a defence matter), the enforcement of immigration law, and national security (including intelligence services). The Department of Justice's main counterparts in the United Kingdom Government are: * the Home Office (on policing, drugs and public order); * the Ministry of Justice (on criminal law, courts, prisons, probation); * the Northern Ireland Office (on national security in Northern Ireland). In the Irish Government, its main counterpart is the Department of Justice and Equality. A considerable proportion of law enforcement in Northern Ireland (and media coverage of policing and justice stories) is taken up with unresolved cases arising from the Troubles, continuing paramilitary activity and tensions caused by sectarian division. The border results in differences in law between Northern Ireland (the only UK jurisdiction with an international land border) and the Republic of Ireland, which are exploited through smuggling and other forms of crime. The border is expected to become an external border of the European Union, following Brexit. Finance The 2016-2017 Northern Ireland Executive budget allocated a ¬£1,050.5 million resource budget to the Department of Justice: * ¬£746 million for safer communities (mainly the Police Service of Northern Ireland budget) * ¬£93.5 million for the Legal Services Agency * ¬£93.3 million for the Northern Ireland Prison Service * ¬£38.6 million for the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service * ¬£16.3 million for the Probation Board * ¬£16.2 million for the Youth Justice Agency * ¬£15.2 million for compensation services * ¬£15 million for access to justice * ¬£8.6 million for the Police Ombudsman * ¬£6.2 million for the Policing Board * ¬£1.1 million for Criminal Justice Inspection * ¬£500,000 for forensic science This represented an increase from the previous resource budget of ¬£1,023.9 million. The department's capital budget was ¬£58 million, allocated as follows: * ¬£30 million for safer communities * ¬£17 million for the Northern Ireland Prison Service * ¬£4.7 million for the Legal Services Agency * ¬£2.7 million for access to justice * ¬£1.8 million for Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service * ¬£800,000 for compensation services * ¬£800,000 for forensic science * ¬£200,000 for the Youth Justice Agency The Northern Ireland Executive was also provided with ¬£32 million for national security in relation to Northern Ireland, ¬£30 million for legacy bodies to deal with the Troubles (not yet established), ¬£5 million to tackle paramilitary activity, and ¬£800,000 to assist with the monitoring of paramilitary activity. Legislation Since the devolution of policing and justice, the Northern Ireland Assembly has enacted seven Acts mainly relating to justice policy: *Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 *Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 2013 *Legal Aid and Coroners' Courts Act (Northern Ireland) 2014 *Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Criminal Justice and Support for Victims) Act (Northern Ireland) 2015 *Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 2015 *Legal Complaints and Regulation Act (Northern Ireland) 2016 *Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 2016 In addition, the Department of Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 2010 formally established the department.

The rotating Coastal Division opponents were Virginia Tech and Duke. In 2009, Maryland played its second game of the home-to-home series against California, this year in Berkeley. The Terrapins finished the season with a record of 2‚Äì10, and 1‚Äì7 in ACC play, and failed to qualify for a bowl game. It was the first ten-loss season in school history. Before the season Coaching changes =Head coach-in-waiting= On February 6, 2009, offensive coordinator James Franklin was officially named the head coach-in-waiting to succeed the 61-year-old Ralph Friedgen, who had three years remaining on his contract. ESPN described the move as an effort to ensure Franklin, considered a top recruiter who had had other coaching opportunities, remained with Maryland.Franklin to succeed Freidgen as coach, ESPN, February 6, 2009. =Defensive coordinator= Upon the conclusion of the 2008 regular season, defensive coordinator Chris Cosh announced his resignation.

Outside linebackers coach Al Seamonson assumed interim defensive coordinator duties for the last game of the 2008 season, the Humanitarian Bowl, and was considered in the running for the job full-time. Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen also contacted Navy defensive coordinator Buddy Green in order to gauge his interest for the position, but he declined in order to remain at Annapolis.

Lempa will now coach only the safeties. Former inside linebackers coach Al Seamonson expanded his role to take over the entire linebacker corps. Friedgen expressed a strong desire to retain Seamonson, who lost out on the race for the defensive coordinator job. Seamonson, as interim defensive coordinator, helped coach Maryland to a 42‚Äì35 victory in the 2008 Humanitarian Bowl.

The highway is the main road that leads to the Lagunas de Zempoala National Park. At Tlalpan, Mexico City, the highway serves the Estadio Azteca.  History  The oldest reference to a road between Mexico City and Acapulco date to 1531, when Hern√°n Cort√©s ordered the construction of a passage in order to move supplies between the capital and the coastal city. It was converted into a more solid road and received the name Road to Asia due to the passage of wares along it. In early 1920 Juan R. Escudero, who was originally from Acapulco, asked President Alvaro Obreg√≥n to expedite the construction of the road, Escudero offering a group of his men to support the construction work. Obreg√≥n agreed and proceeded to improve the sections from Mexico City to Amacuzac and from Iguala to Chilpancingo. A year later, he improved the stretch that runs from Chilpancingo to the south towards Acapulco, and also began a better line of road north of Acapulco.https://programadestinosmexico.com/descubre-mexico/historia/historia- de-acapulco.html accessed Dec 25, 2018 After the murder of Escudero in late 1923, the emergence of the Huerta rebellion and pressure from the bourgeoisie in Acapulco, the work would be stopped again for a short period.

He was an engineer before entering politics. Early life Harris was born in Sydney to Amy Florence (n√©e Ellis) and John Harris, his father being an immigrant from Wales. His family moved to Perth when he was a child. After leaving school, Harris worked as a blacksmith. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in January 1916 (after previous service in the Militia), and during the war served in France with the 3rd Tunnelling Company. Harris worked as an engineer after the war's end and became involved with the Australasian Society of Engineers, in 1931 becoming state president.HARRIS, JOHN (1890‚Äì1974), The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate (Online Edition). Retrieved 9 January 2017. Politics and later life Having previously served on the state executive, Harris won second place on Labor's senate ticket for the 1946 federal election, and was elected. His term began in July 1947. Harris lost his seat at the 1951 double-dissolution election, but won it back at the 1953 half-senate election. He did not contest the 1958 election, retiring at the end of his term in June 1959. In parliament, Harris spoke infrequently, but served on several committees and was generally a strong supporter of Labor policy. He did, however, oppose his party's stance on the banning the Communist Party, speaking in favour of a ban. Harris died in Perth in October 1874, aged 83. He had married Mabel Norton in 1916, with whom he had one son.

Stolzenfels was a ruined 13th-century castle, gifted to the Prussian Crownprince, Frederick William in 1823. He had it rebuilt as a 19th-century palace in Gothic Revival style. Today, it is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Upper Middle Rhine Valley.  History  The original castle at Stolzenfels was built as a fortification by the Prince- Bishop of Trier, then . Finished in 1259, Stolzenfels was used to protect the toll station on the Rhine, where the ships, at the time the main means of transportation for goods, had to stop and pay toll (later moved to Engers). Over the years it was extended several times (notably in the 14th century), occupied by French and Swedish troops in the Thirty Years' War and finally, in 1689, destroyed by the French during the Nine Years' War. The ruin was used as a quarry during the 18th century. In 1802, the castle became the property of the city of Koblenz. In 1823, the ruined castle was given as a gift by the city to Prussian Crownprince Frederick William IV of Prussia. In 1822, the Rhineland had become a province of Prussia. Frederick William had traveled along the Rhine in 1815, the year when the Congress of Vienna awarded several Princedoms in the area to Prussia, and had been fascinated by the beauty, romance and history of the region. In the spirit of Romanticism, Frederick William now had the castle rebuilt as a Gothic Revival palace, inspired by his cousin Frederick's rebuilding of nearby Rheinstein Castle and his cousin Maximilian II of Bavaria's romantic renovation of Hohenschwangau Castle. By 1842, the main buildings and the gardens were finished. On 14 September of that year, Frederick Wiliam, since 1840 King of Prussia, inaugurated his new summer residence in a great celebration with a torchlight procession and medieval costumes. Inauguration of the Gothic chapel occurred in 1845 during a visit by Queen Victoria (who began to build Osborne House the same year and Balmoral Castle three years later). Work on the interior of Stolzenfels castle was completed in 1850. Among those who had worked on the designs for the palace and the gardens were , Karl Friedrich Schinkel (draft), Friedrich August St√ºler (building) and Peter Joseph Lenn√© (garden). St√ºler was later also commissioned to rebuild Hohenzollern Castle in Swabia for the king (1850‚Äì67). After the First World War, the castle became state-owned. After the Second World War, it was assigned to the Landesamt f√ºr Denkmalpflege ‚Äì Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schl√∂sser, today: Generaldirektion Kulturelles Erbe Rheinland-Pfalz, Direktion Burgen Schl√∂sser Altert√ºmer.  World Heritage Site  In 2002, the Upper Middle Rhine Valley became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Site includes Stolzenfels.  Today  After substantial renovation work the castle and its parks were reopened in 2011. The castle is open to the public.

The men were from several communities or villages of the Iatmul people and the Kwoma people. The New Guinea Sculpture Garden is located in a small, wooded grove on the Stanford campus next to a dormitory. In addition to wooden and stone artworks, the garden also features landscaping and plants organized by Wallace M. Ruff, Professor Emeritus of Landscape Architecture, University of Oregon, and research fellow in the Department of Architecture and Building, Papua New Guinea University of Technology, Lae, Papua New Guinea. He was assisted by one of his students, Kora Korawali. The landscaping evokes the Sepik environment ‚Äì river flanked by embankments - as well as the central plaza in Sepik villages, in front of an all-male cult house or men‚Äôs house, which are used for the staging of rituals. The entrance to the garden is an open space, like the Sepik flood plain. But visitors quickly stroll into a forest of sculptures and trees reminiscent of a majestic Sepik cult house. The garden is roughly organized into four zones. Near the entrance is a large, wooden eagle atop the shoulders of an ancestresses. This statue resembles the finials that often adorn Iatmul cult houses. Behind the eagle is a cluster of about a dozen, enormously tall wooden poles carved with exquisitely elaborate Iatmul and Kwoma motifs and patterns. A series of brightly painted Kwoma poles forms another aesthetic cluster, while the third area of the garden consists of large sculptures in pumice, an entirely new medium for the carvers since stone is rare in the Sepik flood plain. At night, the objects are aglow from ground-level spot lights. The stone sculptures largely represent Sepik mythological creatures modeled after Western sculptures found elsewhere on the Stanford campus. The carved poles subtly blend traditional and modem motifs so that, for example, ancestresses wear grass skirts. Many of the carvings beautifully wind around the natural contours of the wood, a sense of three-dimensionality that was not traditionally incorporated into Sepik carving. One of the most brilliant works in the garden is a bare pole that contains only a hint of the sculpture it might have become. This work, titled \\"untitled,‚Äù expresses the processual aspects of the garden, and the unfinalizability and partiality of any interpretation. The garden wonderfully plays with themes of light and shadow, revelation and concealment, nature and culture. It is and is not mysterious, contemplative, quiet, and surreal. The logistics of the project were enormous. Mason raised $250,000 in individual donations. One could sponsor a fern for $250, a palm tree for $500, a bench for $750, and so forth. Large donations are acknowledged, like the artworks themselves, by name. Corporate donors included Bechtel Corporation, Chevron, and Airnuigini, the national airline of Papua New Guinea. Funds were also supplied by the National Endowment for the Humanities, Stanford University, and affluent Palo Alto families. The university allowed the garden a permanent site. Mason arranged for several dozen hardwood trees to be shipped to the campus from Asia. The ten woodcarvers were flown to California from the Sepik by way of Hong Kong, a journey that far exceeded any of their previous travels. Once they arrived, the carvers were the toast of Palo Alto and multicultural Stanford. They dined at catered events in mansions and performed with African-American drummers outside dormitories. The carvers, working on a six-month educational visa, were given local donations by individuals, organizations, and businesses of food, medical care, clothing, transportation, recreation, materials, and a trip to Disneyland. One of the Iatmul artists, Teddy Balangu from Palimbei village, later was an artist-in-residence at the Museum of Anthropology at UBC (University of British Columbia).http://moa.ubc.ca/portfolio_page/sepik- artist-in-residence/ He also spent time at Alcheringa Gallery in Victoria, British Columbia. The \\"spirit of the project\\" framed the carvers as \\"artists\\" and not as exotic, anonymous specimens of primitive savagery and mystery. By labeling the men as \\"master carvers\\", the project positioned them in Western category defined by rare artistic genius, a category defined by the very terms of connoisseurship that once marginalized Melanesian art as something less refined than Western masterpieces or so-called \\"high art\\". This way, visitors approached the carvers and their works not as primitives and crafts but as authentic artists and art. However, in Iatmul society, there is no comparable category of \\"master carver\\" in the local lexicon or social structure. Ironically, then, the garden fostered the Western appreciation of non-Western art by substituting one western category for another. One of the great aesthetic joys of the sculpture garden is the visual contemplation of the ironies that arise from the cross-cultural dialogue and categorization of artworks in the contemporary, transnational or globalized world. A goal of the project was not to recreate a traditional Melanesian setting but, as Mason himself reported, to create \\"an opportunity to experiment with and reinterpret New Guinea aesthetic perspectives within the new context of a Western public art space.\\" The carvers, it was hoped, would blend traditional, Sepik River themes with the ideals of Western modern art such as individualistic expression and the creation of art solely for a contemplative gaze (so-called \\"art for art's sake\\"). That is, the carvers were given an opportunity to \\"break free\\", in a sense, from the conventional aesthetic constraints of the village in the Papua New Guinea ‚Äì to create art not possible in a Sepik River setting. Much of the success of the project resulted from the interplay of different yet not-necessarily compatible cross-cultural categories: Melanesia/West, traditional/modern, art/culture, and so forth. Thus the men were brought to Stanford University on the basis of their Sepik River or Papua New Guinean identity; but once there, they were encouraged to think of themselves not as Papua New Guineans but as artists. Moreover, the artists were given considerable input into the project, thus intentionally dispersing \\"curatorial authority\\" such that, in contrast to most museums, the \\"tribal\\" artists are lent considerable \\"voice\\" in the final display of their works, and in choose how and what works to display. Similarly, the garden foregrounds the individuality of the artists ‚Äì identifying them by name on each piece, which rarely, if ever, occurs in museum displays of \\"traditional\\" tribal art. An essential part of the six-month process was a variety of collaborative programs: daily site tours, bamboo flute performances by the carvers, a public lecture series, Friday night barbeques, \\"story-time\\" with the artists, and outreach programs for school children, such as on-site bark painting. These interactive encounters are vital to the authenticity of the works. The sculptures that received the greatest amount of press and attention were two carvings in wood and pumice respectively that intentionally resemble Rodin sculptures displayed elsewhere on the Stanford campus, The Thinker and The Gates of Hell. Both sculptures were carved by the two Iatmul men from Tambunum village. According to Simon, when he saw The Thinker in the Iris & B. Gerald Cantor Center for Visual Arts on campus, he thought to himself, \\"I can do this - even better!\\"For images of both sculptures at Stanford, see https://museum.stanford.edu/view/rodin.html The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden has its own Facebook page.

He emigrated from his home country to continental Europe in 1830, and later moved to the United States. He was a professor at the Chestnut Hill Academy in Philadelphia, and was a member of the Pennsylvania State Legislature from 1857 to 1869. Civil War Owen entered the Civil War as the commander of the nine-month 25th Pennsylvania Infantry. When that unit was discharged, he took command of the 69th Pennsylvania Infantry, a predominantly Irish regiment that was part of the Philadelphia Brigade. He eventually rose to the command of the Philadelphia Brigade in the II Corps, Army of the Potomac. He led the brigade at the Battle of Chancellorsville, where it performed barely any service. Owen was arrested and relieved of brigade command for reasons unknown. He was then replaced by Alexander S. Webb, who led the brigade admirably at Gettysburg. Owen later returned to his brigade after Gettysburg and led it at the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, where he failed to support another brigade in the famed assault. He was arrested by Maj. Gen. John Gibbon on the charges of cowardice and was discharged from the army. Postbellum career After the war, Owen returned to Pennsylvania and served various jobs.

It was originally titled Project Hostile Intent. The purpose is to detect \\"Mal Intent\\" by screening people for \\"psychological and physiological indicators\\" in a \\"Mobile Screening Laboratory\\". Background  DHS officials viewing a FAST prototype demonstration Artist's concept showing projected use of Future Attribute Screening Technology The program was under the Homeland Security Advanced Research Agency and the Science & Technology Human Factors Behavior Science Division of DHS. In a meeting held on July 24, 2008 the DHS Under Secretary Jay Cohen stated, the goal is to create a new technology that would be working in real time as opposed to after a crime is already committed. The DHS science spokesman John Verrico stated in September 2008 that preliminary testing had demonstrated 78% accuracy on mal-intent detection and 80% on deception. However, this was not a controlled, double-blind study, and researchers from Lawrence University and the Federation of American Scientists have questioned its validity without further evidence. The system measures pulse rate, skin temperature, breathing, facial expression, body movement, pupil dilation, and other \\"psycho physiological/behavioral patterns\\" to stop \\"unknown terrorists\\". The technology would mostly be used at airports, borders, and special events. Fox News reported that the mobile units transmit data to analysts, who use \\"a system to recognize, define and measure seven primary emotions and emotional cues that are reflected in contractions of facial muscles.\\" The system is named MALINTENT. Results are transmitted back to screeners. DHS produced a 'privacy impact assessment' in 2008. It described the system as comprising: *A remote cardiovascular and respiratory sensor to measure heart rate and respiration *A remote eye tracker *Thermal cameras that provide information on the temperature of the skin in the face *A high resolution video for looking at facial expressions and body movements *Audio system for analyzing changes in voice pitch *Possibly other sensors, perhaps pheromone detection *Anonymized aggregate results of the scanned information The DHS plan on using cameras and sensors to measure and track the changes in a person's body language, the tone of their voice and the rhythm of their speech. Civil Liberties Groups raised privacy concerns about the project but Burns from the DHS claims \\"the technology would erase data after each screening, and no personal information would be used to identify subjects, create files, or make lists\\". He reassured the public that regulations would be put in place to protect privacy if and when the technology is deployed.

Others noted that the basic premise may be flawed.

To my knowledge, it has not been demonstrated.\\" The Nature article in which he was quoted went on to note that Altergood is concerned that the technology \\"will produce a large proportion of false positives, frequently tagging innocent people as potential terrorists and making the system unworkable in a busy airport.\\" Due to the ability of the system to 'read people's thoughts', it is potentially in violation of privacy laws such as the Fourth and Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Components of the TIM complex facilitate the translocation of proteins across the inner membrane and into the mitochondrial matrix. They also facilitate the insertion of proteins into the inner mitochondrial membrane, where they must reside in order to function, these mainly include members of the mitochondrial carrier family of proteins. The TIM23 complex The TIM23 complex facilitates translocation of matrix-targeted proteins into the mitochondrial matrix. These proteins contain a cleavable presequence. The TIM23 complex is made up of the subunits Tim17, Tim21 and Tim23, which are thought to contribute to the structural formation of the translocation channel that spans the inner membrane, and Tim44, which is a peripheral membrane protein. Tim44 is only weakly associated with Tim23 and is located on the matrix side of the inner membrane. At the opening of the TIM17-23 complex, Tim44 recruits mitochondrial heat shock protein 70, which further mediates translocation of the precursor through ATP hydrolysis. Following protein entry into the matrix, the presequence is cleaved off by the matrix processing peptidase and the protein undergoes folding into an active conformation, facilitated by HSP60. The TIM22 complex The TIM22 complex is responsible for mediating the integration of carrier preproteins into the inner membrane. Tim22, a subunit of the TIM22 complex, forms a channel within the inner membrane and is referred to as the carrier translocase. Tim54 and the small Tim proteins, Tim9, Tim10 and Tim12 also contribute to the TIM22 complex as well as Tim18. The function of Tim18 is not yet clear; however it is believed to play a role in assembly and stabilisation of the TIM22 complex, although is not involved in protein insertion into the membrane. Tim54, although it does not associate directly with Tim22, is also believed to assist in the stability of Tim22. Unlike cleavable preproteins, following translocation across the outer membrane via the translocase of the outer membrane, carrier preproteins are bound by the soluble Tim9-Tim10 complex of which the majority of this complex (~95%) is free floating within the intermembrane space. It is possible that this small Tim complex is able to stabilise precursor carrier proteins by acting as a chaperone and preventing the hydrophobic precursors from aggregating in the aqueous environment of the intermembrane space. A small portion of Tim9 and Tim10 (~5%) assembles into a modified complex containing Tim12, on the outer surface of the TIM22 complex. Tim12 is membrane bound and thus may act as a linker molecule docking Tim9 and Tim10 to the face of the TIM22 complex. The carrier preprotein is then inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane in a potential-dependent fashion. The membrane potential is necessary for both insertion of the precursor into the carrier translocase and lateral release of the protein into the lipid phase of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which completes protein translocation. However this membrane potential-dependent process takes place in absence of ATP-driven machinery.

Up to six pictures of an object are produced (called primary views), with each projection plane parallel to one of the coordinate axes of the object. The views are positioned relative to each other according to either of two schemes: first-angle or third-angle projection. In each, the appearances of views may be thought of as being projected onto planes that form a six-sided box around the object. Although six different sides can be drawn, usually three views of a drawing give enough information to make a three-dimensional object. These views are known as front view, top view and end view. Other names for these views include plan, elevation and section. The terms orthographic projection and orthogonal projection are sometimes reserved specifically for multiview. However, orthographic and orthogonal more correctly refer to the right angle formed between the projection rays and the projection plane, versus the angle formed between the subject of the drawing and the projection plane. Thus, orthographic projections include axonometric or auxiliary views in addition to multiviews. Overview Comparison of several types of graphical projection, including elevation and plan views To render each such picture, a ray of sight (also called a projection line, projection ray or line of sight) towards the object is chosen, which determines on the object various points of interest (for instance, the points that are visible when looking at the object along the ray of sight); those points of interest are mapped by an orthographic projection to points on some geometric plane (called a projection plane or image plane) that is perpendicular to the ray of sight, thereby creating a 2D representation of the 3D object. Customarily, two rays of sight are chosen for each of the three axes of the object's coordinate system; that is, parallel to each axis, the object may be viewed in one of 2 opposite directions, making for a total of 6 orthographic projections (or \\"views\\") of the object: * Along a vertical axis (often the y-axis): The top and bottom views, which are known as plans (because they show the arrangement of features on a horizontal plane, such as a floor in a building). * Along a horizontal axis (often the z-axis): The front and back views, which are known as elevations (because they show the heights of features of an object such as a building). * Along an orthogonal axis (often the x-axis): The left and right views, which are also known as elevations, following the same reasoning. These six planes of projection intersect each other, forming a box around the object, the most uniform construction of which is a cube; traditionally, these six views are presented together by first projecting the 3D object onto the 2D faces of a cube, and then \\"unfolding\\" the faces of the cube such that all of them are contained within the same plane (namely, the plane of the medium on which all of the images will be presented together, such as a piece of paper, or a computer monitor, etc.). However, even if the faces of the box are unfolded in one standardized way, there is ambiguity as to which projection is being displayed by a particular face; the cube has two faces that are perpendicular to a ray of sight, and the points of interest may be projected onto either one of them, a choice which has resulted in two predominant standards of projection: # First-angle projection: In this type of projection, the object is imagined to be in the first quadrant. Because the observer normally looks from the right side of the quadrant to obtain the front view, the objects will come in between the observer and the plane of projection. Therefore, in this case, the object is imagined to be transparent, and the projectors are imagined to be extended from various points of the object to meet the projection plane. When these meeting points are joined in order on the plane they form an image, thus in the first angle projection, any view is so placed that it represents the side of the object away from it. First angle projection is often used throughout parts of Europe so that it is often called European projection. # Third-angle projection: In this type of projection, the object is imagined to be in the third quadrant. Again, as the observer is normally supposed to look from the right side of the quadrant to obtain the front view, in this method, the projection plane comes in between the observer and the object. Therefore, the plane of projection is assumed to be transparent. The intersection of this plan with the projectors from all the points of the object would form an image on the transparent plane. Primary views Multiview projections show the primary views of an object, each viewed in a direction parallel to one of the main coordinate axes. These primary views are called plans and elevations. Sometimes they are shown as if the object has been cut across or sectioned to expose the interior: these views are called sections. Plan A plan view of Millbank Prison, 1828 A plan is a view of a 3-dimensional object seen from vertically above (or sometimes below). It may be drawn in the position of a horizontal plane passing through, above, or below the object. The outline of a shape in this view is sometimes called its planform, for example with aircraft wings. The plan view from above a building is called its roof plan. A section seen in a horizontal plane through the walls and showing the floor beneath is called a floor plan. Elevation Principal fa√ßade of the Panth√©on, Paris, by Jacques-Germain Soufflot. Elevation is the view of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a vertical plane beside an object. In other words, an elevation is a side view as viewed from the front, back, left or right (and referred to as a front elevation, [left/ right] side elevation, and a rear elevation). An elevation is a common method of depicting the external configuration and detailing of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions. Building fa√ßades are shown as elevations in architectural drawings and technical drawings. Elevations are the most common orthographic projection for conveying the appearance of a building from the exterior. Perspectives are also commonly used for this purpose. A building elevation is typically labeled in relation to the compass direction it faces; the direction from which a person views it. E.g. the North Elevation of a building is the side that most closely faces true north on the compass. Interior elevations are used to show details such as millwork and trim configurations. In the building industry elevations are non-perspective views of the structure. These are drawn to scale so that measurements can be taken for any aspect necessary. Drawing sets include front, rear, and both side elevations. The elevations specify the composition of the different facades of the building, including ridge heights, the positioning of the final fall of the land, exterior finishes, roof pitches, and other architectural details. =Developed elevation= A developed elevation is a variant of a regular elevation view in which several adjacent non-parallel sides may be shown together as if they have been unfolded. For example, the north and west views may be shown side-by-side, sharing an edge, even though this does not represent a proper orthographic projection. Section A section, or cross-section, is a view of a 3-dimensional object from the position of a plane through the object. A section is a common method of depicting the internal arrangement of a 3-dimensional object in two dimensions. It is often used in technical drawing and is traditionally crosshatched. The style of crosshatching often indicates the type of material the section passes through. With computed axial tomography, computers construct cross-sections from x-ray data.

Introduction to Graphics Communications for Engineers (4th Ed.). New York, NY. 2009 These views are typically used when an object has a surface in an oblique plane. By projecting into a plane parallel with the oblique surface, the true size and shape of the surface are shown. Auxiliary views tend to make use of axonometric projection. Multiviews Quadrants in descriptive geometry Gaspard Monge's four quadrants and two planes. Modern orthographic projection is derived from Gaspard Monge's descriptive geometry. Monge defined a reference system of two viewing planes, horizontal H (\\"ground\\") and vertical V (\\"backdrop\\"). These two planes intersect to partition 3D space into 4 quadrants, which he labeled: * I: above H, in front of V * II: above H, behind V * III: below H, behind V * IV: below H, in front of V These quadrant labels are the same as used in 2D planar geometry, as seen from infinitely far to the \\"left\\", taking H and V to be the X-axis and Y-axis, respectively. The 3D object of interest is then placed into either quadrant I or III (equivalently, the position of the intersection line between the two planes is shifted), obtaining first- and third-angle projections, respectively. Quadrants II and IV are also mathematically valid, but their use would result in one view \\"true\\" and the other view \\"flipped\\" by 180¬∞ through its vertical centerline, which is too confusing for technical drawings. (In cases where such a view is useful, e.g. a ceiling viewed from above, a reflected view is used, which is a mirror image of the true orthographic view.) Monge's original formulation uses two planes only and obtains the top and front views only. The addition of a third plane to show a side view (either left or right) is a modern extension. The terminology of quadrant is a mild anachronism, as a modern orthographic projection with three views corresponds more precisely to an octant of 3D space. ''' First-angle projection In first-angle projection, the object is conceptually located in quadrant I, i.e. it floats above and before the viewing planes, the planes are opaque, and each view is pushed through the object onto the plane furthest from it. (Mnemonic: an \\"actor on a stage\\".) Extending to the 6-sided box, each view of the object is projected in the direction (sense) of sight of the object, onto the (opaque) interior walls of the box; that is, each view of the object is drawn on the opposite side of the box. A two-dimensional representation of the object is then created by \\"unfolding\\" the box, to view all of the interior walls. This produces two plans and four elevations. A simpler way to visualize this is to place the object on top of an upside-down bowl. Sliding the object down the right edge of the bowl reveals the right side view.

File:First angle projecting.svgThe same image, with views of the object projected in the direction of sight onto walls using first-angle projection. File:First angle unfolding.svgSimilar image showing the box unfolding from around the object. File:First angle unfolded.svgImage showing orthographic views located relative to each other in accordance with first-angle projection. ''' Third-angle projection An example of a multiview orthographic drawing from a US Patent (1913), showing two views of the same object. Third angle projection is used. In third-angle projection, the object is conceptually located in quadrant III, i.e. it is positioned below and behind the viewing planes, the planes are transparent, and each view is pulled onto the plane closest to it. (Mnemonic: a \\"shark in a tank\\", esp. that is sunken into the floor.) Using the 6-sided viewing box, each view of the object is projected opposite to the direction (sense) of sight, onto the (transparent) exterior walls of the box; that is, each view of the object is drawn on the same side of the box. The box is then unfolded to view all of its exterior walls. A simpler way to visualize this is to place the object in the bottom of a bowl. Sliding the object up the right edge of the bowl reveals the right side view. Here is the construction of third angle projections of the same object as above. Note that the individual views are the same, just arranged differently. File:Object in box upload.svg File:Third angle projecting.svg File:Third angle unfolding.svg File:Third angle unfolded.svg Additional information First-angle projection is as if the object were sitting on the paper and, from the \\"face\\" (front) view, it is rolled to the right to show the left side or rolled up to show its bottom. It is standard throughout Europe and Asia (excluding Japan). First-angle projection was widely used in the UK, but during World War II, British drawings sent to be manufactured in the USA, such as of the Rolls-Royce Merlin, had to be drawn in third-angle projection before they could be produced, e.g., as the Packard V-1650 Merlin. This meant that some British companies completely adopted third angle projection. BS 308 (Part 1) Engineering Drawing Practice, gave the option of using both projections, but generally, every illustration (other than the ones explaining the difference between first and third-angle) was done in first-angle. After the withdrawal of BS 308 in 1999, BS 8888 offered the same choice since it referred directly to ISO 5456-2, Technical drawings ‚Äì Projection methods ‚Äì Part 2: Orthographic representations. Third-angle is as if the object were a box to be unfolded. If we unfold the box so that the front view is in the center of the two arms, then the top view is above it, the bottom view is below it, the left view is to the left, and the right view is to the right. It is standard in the USA (ASME Y14.3-2003 specifies it as the default projection system), Japan (JIS B 0001:2010 specifies it as the default projection system), Canada, and Australia. Both first-angle and third- angle projections result in the same 6 views; the difference between them is the arrangement of these views around the box. A great deal of confusion has ensued in drafting rooms and engineering departments when drawings are transferred from one convention to another. On engineering drawings, the projection is denoted by an international symbol representing a truncated cone in either first-angle or third-angle projection, as shown by the diagram on the right. Symbols used to define whether a projection is either first angle (left) or third angle (right) The 3D interpretation is a solid truncated cone, with the small end pointing toward the viewer. The front view is, therefore, two concentric circles. The fact that the inner circle is drawn with a solid line instead of dashed identifies this view as the front view, not the rear view.The side view is an isosceles trapezoid. * In first-angle projection, the front view is pushed back to the rear wall, and the right side view is pushed to the left wall, so the first-angle symbol shows the trapezoid with its shortest side away from the circles. * In third-angle projection, the front view is pulled forward to the front wall, and the right side view is pulled to the right wall, so the third-angle symbol shows the trapezoid with its shortest side towards the circles. Multiviews without rotation Orthographic multiview projection is derived from the principles of descriptive geometry and may produce an image of a specified, imaginary object as viewed from any direction of space. Orthographic projection is distinguished by parallel projectors emanating from all points of the imaged object and which intersect of projection at right angles. Above, a technique is described that obtains varying views by projecting images after the object is rotated to the desired position. Descriptive geometry customarily relies on obtaining various views by imagining an object to be stationary and changing the direction of projection (viewing) in order to obtain the desired view. See Figure 1. Using the rotation technique above, note that no orthographic view is available looking perpendicularly at any of the inclined surfaces. Suppose a technician desired such a view to, say, look through a hole to be drilled perpendicularly to the surface. Such a view might be desired for calculating clearances or for dimensioning purposes. To obtain this view without multiple rotations requires the principles of Descriptive Geometry. The steps below describe the use of these principles in third angle projection. Figures one through nine. *Fig.1: Pictorial of the imaginary object that the technician wishes to image. *Fig.2: The object is imagined behind a vertical plane of projection. The angled corner of the plane of projection is addressed later. *Fig.3: Projectors emanate parallel from all points of the object, perpendicular to the plane of projection. *Fig.4: An image is created thereby. *Fig.5: A second, horizontal plane of projection is added, perpendicular to the first. *Fig.6: Projectors emanate parallel from all points of the object perpendicular to the second plane of projection. *Fig.7: An image is created thereby. *Fig.8: The third plane of projection is added, perpendicular to the previous two. *Fig.9: Projectors emanate parallel from all points of the object perpendicular to the third plane of projection.

Territorial use First-angle is used in most of the world. Third-angle projection is most commonly used in America, Japan (in JIS B 0001Ôºö2010); and is preferred in Australia, as laid down in AS 1100.101‚Äî1992 6.3.3. In the UK, BS8888 9.7.2.1 allows for three different conventions for arranging views: Labelled Views, Third Angle Projection, and First Angle Projection.

This was a year after sister Engine No. 371 brought the first train to cross Canada into Port Moody, roughly to the east. History No. 374 was built by the CPR in 1886 and was one of eight similar steam locomotives built that year in their Montreal shops. While No. 371 was scrapped in 1915, No. 374 was completely rebuilt in 1914 and continued in service until 1945. Because of its historical significance, it was donated to the City of Vancouver upon its retirement, which placed it on display in Kitsilano Beach Park. It suffered greatly from exposure to the elements and a lack of upkeep. It remained there until 1983, when a group of railway enthusiasts launched an effort to restore the engine in time for Expo 86. It was moved from the beach and spent the next few years in different warehouses around Vancouver while a crew of volunteers undertook the task of restoring the engine. Completed in time for Expo, No. 374 was put on display on the turntable at the renovated former CPR Drake Street Roundhouse where it became a prime attraction. In 1988 the Expo 86 site, including the Drake Street Roundhouse, was sold to Concord Pacific, and in the course of the False Creek North Development Plan, the developer agreed to convert and expand the buildings to comprise the Roundhouse Community Centre. The Community Centre was designed by Baker McGarva Hart and completed in 1997. The plan for the development had made no mention of the 374 and it was temporarily housed inside the roundhouse itself while it was decided what to do with the engine. Successful fundraising efforts were undertaken by the Vancouver Parks Board and the Lions Club, among others, and a year later the new Engine 374 Pavilion was completed. Now a central feature of the Yaletown area redevelopment, the Engine 374 Pavilion is open daily for public viewing from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. during the summer and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the winter. An anniversary celebration is held annually on the Sunday before Victoria Day. The pavilion is staffed entirely by volunteers from the West Coast Railway Association and on average sees roughly 41,000 visitors per year as of 2015.

The structure constants are f^{abc} = \\\\epsilon^{abc}, where \\\\epsilon^{abc} is the antisymmetric Levi-Civita symbol. In mathematics, the structure constants or structure coefficients of an algebra over a field are used to explicitly specify the product of two basis vectors in the algebra as a linear combination. Given the structure constants, the resulting product is bilinear and can be uniquely extended to all vectors in the vector space, thus uniquely determining the product for the algebra. Structure constants are used whenever an explicit form for the algebra must be given. Thus, they are frequently used when discussing Lie algebras in physics, as the basis vectors indicate specific directions in physical space, or correspond to specific particles. Recall that Lie algebras are algebras over a field, with the bilinear product being given by the Lie bracket or commutator. Definition Given a set of basis vectors \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{e}_i\\\\\\\\} for the underlying vector space of the algebra, the structure constants or structure coefficients c_{ij}^{\\\\;k} express the multiplication \\\\cdot of pairs of vectors as a linear combination: :\\\\mathbf{e}_i \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{e}_j = \\\\sum_{k} c_{ij}^{\\\\;\\\\;k} \\\\mathbf{e}_k. The upper and lower indices are frequently not distinguished, unless the algebra is endowed with some other structure that would require this (for example, a pseudo-Riemannian metric, on the algebra of the indefinite orthogonal group so(p,q)). That is, structure constants are often written with all-upper, or all-lower indexes. The distinction between upper and lower is then a convention, reminding the reader that lower indices behave like the components of a dual vector, i.e. are covariant under a change of basis, while upper indices are contravariant.  Example: Lie algebras  For a Lie algebra, the basis vectors are termed the generators of the algebra, and the product is given by the Lie bracket. That is, the algebra product \\\\cdot is defined to be the Lie bracket: for two vectors A and B in the algebra, the product is A\\\\cdot B\\\\equiv [A,B]. In particular, the algebra product \\\\cdot must not be confused with a matrix product, and thus sometimes requires an alternate notation. There is no particular need to distinguish the upper and lower indices in this case; they can be written all up or all down. In physics, it is common to use the notation T_i for the generators, and f_{ab}^{\\\\;\\\\;c} or f^{abc} (ignoring the upper-lower distinction) for the structure constants. The Lie bracket of pairs of generators is a linear combination of generators from the set, i.e. :[T_a, T_b] = \\\\sum_{c} f_{ab}^{\\\\;\\\\;c} T_c. By linear extension, the structure constants completely determine the Lie brackets of all elements of the Lie algebra. All Lie algebras satisfy the Jacobi identity. For the basis vectors, it can be written as :[T_a, [T_b,T_c + [T_b, [T_c, T_a + [T_c, [T_a, T_b = 0 and this leads directly to a corresponding identity in terms of the structure constants: :f_{ad}^{\\\\;\\\\;e}f_{bc}^{\\\\;\\\\;d} + f_{bd}^{\\\\;\\\\;e}f_{ca}^{\\\\;\\\\;d} + f_{cd}^{\\\\;\\\\;e}f_{ab}^{\\\\;\\\\;d} = 0. The above, and the remainder of this article, make use of the Einstein summation convention for repeated indexes. The structure constants play a role in Lie algebra representations, and in fact, give exactly the matrix elements of the adjoint representation. The Killing form and the Casimir invariant also have a particularly simple form, when written in terms of the structure constants. The structure constants often make an appearance in the approximation to the Baker‚ÄìCampbell‚ÄìHausdorff formula for the product of two elements of a Lie group. For small elements X, Y of the Lie algebra, the structure of the Lie group near the identity element is given by \\\\exp(X)\\\\exp(Y) \\\\approx \\\\exp(X + Y + \\\\tfrac{1}{2}[X,Y]). Note the factor of 1/2.  Lie algebra examples   ùñòùñö(2) and ùñòùñî(3) The algebra ùñòùñö(2) of the special unitary group SU(2) is three-dimensional, with generators given by the Pauli matrices \\\\sigma_i. The generators of the group SU(2) satisfy the commutation relations (where \\\\epsilon^{abc} is the Levi-Civita symbol): :[\\\\sigma_a, \\\\sigma_b] = 2 i \\\\epsilon^{abc} \\\\sigma_c where :{ border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" \\\\sigma_1 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\sigma_2 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\\\\\\\\\ i & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\sigma_3 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -1 \\\\end{pmatrix} } In this case, the structure constants are f^{abc} = 2 i \\\\epsilon^{abc}. Note that the constant 2i can be absorbed into the definition of the basis vectors; thus, defining t_a = -i\\\\sigma_a/2, one can equally well write :[t_a, t_b] = \\\\epsilon^{abc} t_c Doing so emphasizes that the Lie algebra ùñòùñö(2) of the Lie group SU(2) is isomorphic to the Lie algebra ùñòùñî(3) of SO(3). This brings the structure constants into line with those of the rotation group SO(3). That is, the commutator for the angular momentum operators are then commonly written as :[L_i, L_j] = \\\\epsilon^{ijk} L_k where :{ border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" L_x = L_1 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} L_y = L_2 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} L_z = L_3 = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} } are written so as to obey the right hand rule for rotations in 3-dimensional space. The difference of the factor of 2i between these two sets of structure constants can be infuriating, as it involves some subtlety. Thus, for example, the two-dimensional complex vector space can be given a real structure. This leads to two inequivalent two-dimensional fundamental representations of ùñòùñö(2), which are isomorphic, but are complex conjugate representations; both, however, are considered to be real representations, precisely because they act on a space with a real structure. In the case of three dimensions, there is only one three-dimensional representation, the adjoint representation, which is a real representation; more precisely, it is the same as its dual representation, shown above. That is, one has that the transpose is minus itself: L_k^T=-L_k. In any case, the Lie groups are considered to be real, precisely because it is possible to write the structure constants so that they are purely real.  ùñòùñö(3)  A less trivial example is given by SU(3):Weinberg, Steven, The Quantum Theory of Fields, Volume 1: Foundations, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, (1995). .

One of the selections is \\"Little Bun Rabbit,\\" the final piece in Baum's Mother Goose in Prose from 1897. The protagonist in Baum's version of the nursery rhyme is a little girl who can talk to animals ‚Äì named Dorothy. When Baum reprinted in story in his Juvenile Speaker, he changed the character's name to Doris, to forestall confusion with Dorothy Gale from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.L.

Reprints Materials from the Juvenile Speaker were republished in different volumes in later years. In 1916 and 1917, Baum's publisher Reilly & Britton issued stories from the anthology in six smaller 62-page books collectively called The Snuggle Tales, with black-and-white Neill illustrations. (They were originally sold for $0.40 each.) The publisher had used this approach successfully in the Little Wizard Stories of Oz in 1913-14, as a way of reaching beginning readers. The six Snuggle Tales books are: * Little Bun Rabbit and Other Stories (1916) * Once Upon a Time and Other Stories (1916) * The Yellow Hen and Other Stories (1916) * The Magic Cloak and Other Stories (1916) * The Gingerbread Man (1917) * Jack Pumpkinhead (1917).

The non-pallial part of the telencephalon builds the subpallium. In basal vertebrates the pallium is a relatively simple three-layered structure, encompassing 3‚Äì4 histogenetically distinct domains, plus the olfactory bulb. It used to be thought that pallium equals cortex and subpallium equals telencephalic nuclei, but it has turned out, according to comparative evidence provided by molecular markers, that the pallium develops both cortical structures (allocortex and isocortex) and pallial nuclei (claustroamygdaloid complex), whereas the subpallium develops striatal, pallidal, diagonal-innominate and preoptic nuclei, plus the corticoid structure of the olfactory tuberculum. In mammals, the cortical part of the pallium registers a definite evolutionary step-up in complexity, forming the cerebral cortex, most of which consists of a progressively expanded six-layered portion isocortex, with simpler three- layered cortical regions allocortex at the margins. The allocortex subdivides into hippocampal allocortex, medially, and olfactory allocortex, laterally (including rostrally the olfactory bulb and anterior olfactory areas).  Structure  The general layout or body plan of the pallium is already clearly defined in animals with relatively simple brains, including lampreys, sharks and amphibians. In teleost fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals, the pallial architecture is greatly modified (sharply divergently in fish), with differential growth and specialization of diverse sectors of the conserved pallial Bauplan. In all vertebrate brains, the telencephalic forebrain consists of two hemispheres, joined at the midline by a region called the septum. The septum is continuous with the preoptic area across the plane defined by the anterior commissure; it is largely subpallial, but also contains a small pallial portion, where the hippocampal commissure forms, which is contiguous to the medial pallium. The telencephalic part of the rostral choroidal tela (roof plate continuous caudally with a diencephalic part) is inserted at the back of this commissure at a locus where mammals show the subfornical circumventricular organ, and extends laterally over the interventricular foramen into a wing-shaped medial telencephalic territory, the so-called choroidal fissure. Here the choroidal tissue is attached to the fimbria of the hippocampus (also known as the cortical hem area), bordering lengthwise the medial pallium. At its rostral and caudal ends, the medial pallium contacts the ventral pallium, which builds the pallial portion that contacts the subpallium across the pallio subpallial boundary, observed at the lateral telencephalic wall. Inside the ring formed thus by the medial and ventral pallium there is a sort of island that contains the dorsal and lateral pallial portions. In older literature the pallium used to be subdivided only into three zones, called the medial pallium, dorsal (or dorsolateral) pallium, and lateral pallium. The old lateral pallium encompassed the modern lateral and ventral parts of the pallium. The medial pallium is the progenitor of the mammalian hippocampus, and is thought to be involved in spatial cognitive mapping and memory formation across a broad range of species. The lateral and ventral pallium is the progenitor of the mammalian piriform cortex, and has an olfactory function in every species in which it has been studied. The evolutionary diversifications and specialization in functions of the dorsal pallium have been more difficult to decipher. It is widely believed to be the progenitor of the bulk of the mammalian cerebral cortex, although the evidence for this is considered by some anatomists not yet to be conclusive. Importantly, the lateral and ventral parts of the pallium produce also deep to their respective sectors of subpial olfactory cortex sets of pallial nuclei, the neurons entering the claustrum, rostrally, and the pallial amygdala, caudally. The concept of hypopallium refers to this histogenetically unitary complex of olfactory (piriform) cortex and deep pallial nuclei. In reptiles and birds the hypopallium becomes differentially enlarged (largest in crocodiles and birds, whose olfactory cortex gets nevertheless reduced), whereas in mammals it becomes reduced to the claustroamygdaloid complex and relatively enlarged olfactory (prepiriform and piriform) cortex. The pallial amygdala contains mainly the so-called basolateral amygdala, encompassing the lateral, basolateral (basal) and basomedial (accessory basal) nuclei, plus the anterior, amygdalopiriform and posterolateral corticoid areas at its surface. The medial pallium also may contribute to the pallial amygdala, forming the amygdalohippocampal nucleus and the posteromedial corticoid area. It has been postulated that the neurons forming the nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract derive from the dorsal pallium and migrate tangentially into its final position caudal to the olfactory tuberculum. Situated ventral to the pallium in the basic vertebrate forebrain plan (though representing a topologically rostral field in neural plate fate maps) is another region of telencephalic gray matter known as the subpallium, which is the progenitor area for the basal ganglia, a set of structures that play a crucial role in the executive control of behavior. The subpallium region has distinct striatal, pallidal, diagonal and preoptic subregions, which are stretched obliquely between the septal midline and the amygdala at the posterior pole of the telencephalon. At least the striatum, pallidum and diagonal domains extend into the amygdala, representing there the subpallial amygdala, forming its central and medial nucleis, as well as the amygdaloid end of the bed nucleus stria terminalis complex. The amygdala thus encompasses an heterogeneous group of subpallial nuclei and hypopallial olfactory and amygdalohippocampal corticonuclear cell masses which are on the whole heavily involved in emotion and motivation. The pallial portions build the analytic or perceptual end of this complex, whereas the subpallial portions represent the corresponding output or efferent functional pole. The olfactory bulb is a peculiar pallial outgrowth (maybe induced by the primary olfactory fibers afferent to it, coming from the sensory neurons developed in the olfactory placode) whose projection neurons (the mitral and tufted neurons) are pallial in origin and accordingly excitatory. In contrast, the superfial periglomerulary neurons, various intermediate interneurons and the deep granule cells are all of subpallial origin and migrate tangentially out of the striatal part of the subpallium (apparently from a dorsal subsector of this domain) through the so-called rostral migratory stream into the olfactory bulb. These extremely numerous subpallial cells are all inhibitory. The olfactory bulb is thus singularly formed by a minority of autochthonous pallial neurons and a majority of immigrated inhibitory subpallial cells (it is nevertheless classified as a part of the ventral pallium). There is also a modified accessory olfactory bulb at the base of the principal one, which is associated specifically to incoming afferents from Jacobson's organ found at the nasal septum. The accessory olfactory pathway is maximally developed in some reptiles (e.g., snakes) and is lost in birds.  Evolution  The evolution of the dorsal pallium is not fully understood yet. Some authors hold that it largely contributes to the mammalian hippocampal allocortical and parahippocampal mesocortical (transitional) areas. Others postulate it directly transforms into the six-layered isocortex (neocortex) characteristic of mammals, and still others suppose that medial and lateral parts of the dorsal pallium contribute (perhaps with some contributions from the lateral pallium) to the alternative allocortical and isocortical fates. In humans The human pallium (cloak in Latin) envelops most of the telencephalon, due to extensive surface expansion of the isocortex. The telencephalic pallium has been described classically as having three parts: the archipallium, the paleopallium and the neopallium, but these concepts are now considered obsolete, having been substituted by the concept of medial pallium, dorsal pallium, lateral pallium and ventral pallium mentioned above under pallial Bauplan. It used to be said in anatomy textbooks that pallium equals cortex and subpallium equals telencephalic nuclei, but it has turned out, according to molecular markers, that the pallium develops both cortical structures (allocortex and isocortex) and pallial nuclei (claustroamygdaloid complex), whereas the subpallium develops striatal, pallidal, diagonal-innominate and preoptic nuclei, plus the corticoid structure of the olfactory tuberculum. In amphibians and other anamniotes In amphibians, the telencephalon distinctly shows medial, dorsal, lateral and ventral parts of the pallium, plus striatal, pallidal, diagonal and preoptic parts of the basal nuclei. However, the pallial portions do not show a visible lamination. They already have a mixture of glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) neurons, whereas the subpallium is largely populated by inhibitory neurons. This structure is very similar to that found generally in anamniotes, though cartilaginous fishes do show a layered arrangement of their pallial neurons. In reptiles and birds Reptiles developed a distinct three-layered structure of medial and dorsal portions of their pallium, a morphological schema referred to with the concept of allocortex. In contrast, the lateral and ventral pallium sectors of reptiles adopted hypopallial structure (superficial olfactory cortex, covering deep pallial nuclei). The hypopallial region is also known as the dorsal ventricular ridge, described as having anterior and posterior (amygdaloid) regions. Birds essentially show much increased cellularity, keeping within the reptilian morphological schema, which leads to the apparent disappearance of layering within its medial and dorsal pallial sectors. The olfactory cortex is much reduced, whereas the hypopallial or dorsal ventricular ridge nuclei increase significantly in size and relative differentiation. From anterior to posterior, the parts are named hyperpallium, mesopallium, nidopallium, and the acropallium.

He briefly served as a member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly in 1971‚Äì1972 representing the seat of Blackwood, then in 1974 was appointed to the Australian Senate to serve out a vacancy which ended the same year. Biography Reid was born in Bridgetown in the South West region of Western Australia to Donald Reid, a primary producer, and Marion (n√©e Davies). He was educated at Bridgetown Primary School and Denmark Agricultural College, before getting a Diploma in Agriculture as an external student at Muresk College (now part of Curtin University). After completing his schooling, he farmed at Bridgetown and did national service with the Army. On 19 October 1957 at St Mary's Church in West Perth, he married Jacynth Horley, with whom he was to have one son and two daughters. In 1970, he became state president of the WA Fruitgrowers' Association and deputy WA representative on the Apple and Pear Board. Reid contested the seat of Blackwood in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly for the Country Party, of which he had been a member since 1965, at the 1971 election, and won with a 7% swing to his party against the Liberals, who had held the seat from 1950 until 1968. He resigned on 26 October 1972 to contest the House of Representatives seat of Forrest at the December 1972 election, causing a by- election in the seat which was won by the Liberals' Sandy Lewis. On 16 January 1974, he was appointed to the Australian Senate as a Country Party Senator for Western Australia, filling the casual vacancy caused by the retirement of Senator Edgar Prowse. From 7 March until 11 April, he was a member of the Joint Committee on Prices. He contested the 1974 election three months later as a National Alliance candidate (the Alliance had been formed between the Western Australian Country Party and the WA branch of the Democratic Labor Party), but he was defeated. Reid served as state president of the party, renamed the National Country Party soon after the election, during 1974 and 1975. He left the party in 1978. In the 1980s, he became heavily involved with promotion of the Bridgetown region, with a four-year stint as president of the Bridgetown-Greenbushes Tourist Bureau. He became involved with the South West Development Authority, one of several regional authorities set up by the Burke government. From 1984 until 1990, he served as deputy chairman of the Advisory Committee and convenor of the Economic Development subcommittee of the Authority. In 1987, he was elected to the Shire of Bridgetown-Greenbushes as a councillor, and from 1990 as Shire President. He was also president of the Bridgetown Rotary Club, director for 5 years of the Blackwood Marathon Relay, and a member of the Bridgetown Hospital Board and Bridgetown Golf Club.

Honman founded Geospatial Sciences at RMIT and ran Land Surveying Courses in the 1930s as part of Civil Engineering Courses. After his secondment to the Australian Government due to the First World War various lecturers took over the courses until Mr. Love was appointed in September 1949. It was Mr. Love who set up a surveying course that met the requirements of the Victorian Board of Surveying requirements. Over time the size and scope of the school has expanded and in 1978 RMIT University was able to award degrees and the school had degrees in Surveying, Cartography and Town Planning. The Department of Surveying became the Department of Land Information in 1987 and was renamed again in the 1990s to the Department of Geospatial Science and in the 2000s was merged with the Department of Mathematics to form the Department of Mathematical and Geospatial Sciences seen today.

By 1905, when it was merged into the Pennsylvania, it owned a main line along the left (west) side of the Monongahela River, to Pittsburgh's South Side from West Brownsville. Branches connected to the South-West Pennsylvania Railway in Uniontown via Redstone Creek and to numerous coal mines. History The company was chartered by the Pennsylvania General Assembly as the Monongahela Valley Railroad in April 1867, with the right to construct a railroad connecting Pittsburgh to Waynesburg; it was renamed Pittsburgh, Virginia and Charleston Railway in February 1870. By November 1872, when the first segment opened from 4th Street in South Pittsburgh (now South Side Pittsburgh) to Homestead, the Pennsylvania Railroad had gained control. The primary purpose of this acquisition was to allow the Pennsylvania to construct a southern bypass around the congestion of Pittsburgh, via a short connection to the Main Line near Turtle Creek.Report of the Investigating Committee of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 1874, p. 207 The line was extended to Monongahela City in 1873, and in 1874 the company began operating a steamboat beyond to Brownsville. Trains began running into downtown Pittsburgh's Union Station in 1875, crossing the Monongahela on the Panhandle Bridge. The connection near Turtle Creek was completed in August 1878, with the opening of the Port Perry Branch and Port Perry Bridge. In 1879 the Pennsylvania began operating the PV&C; under lease as its Monongahela Division.Christopher T. Baer, PRR Chronology (Pennsylvania Railroad Technical and Historical Society) The railroad was crossed by the O'Neil and Company Incline in West Elizabeth, Pennsylvania. The railroad was extended further south along the Monongahela River from Monongahela City beginning in 1879 and reached West Brownsville in 1881. The Brownsville Railway Company began constructing a line from near Brownsville to Uniontown, PA. The PV&C; took over the Brownsville Railway and merged it on May 11, 1880 and finished the construction of its line by 1882. The Brownsville branch was built in 1883 and connected the PV&C;'s acquired Brownsville Railway to its namesake town of Brownsville, PA. The Pittsburgh and Whitehall Rail Road Company constructed a line in South Pittsburgh, PA, in 1886. The line ran from S 3rd Street to a connection with the PV&C; near S 30th Street Yard. The line was operated by the PV&C; starting in November, 1886, and merged May 14, 1888. The McKeesport and Bessemer Rail Road Company built a line from the PV&C; at Cochran to McKeesport, PA, in 1890-1891. The line was first operated by the PV&C; in December 1891, then merged into the PV&C; November 1, 1894. The Monongahela River and Streets Run Rail Road Company acquired what was called the Streets Run branch by the PV&C; from Richard Coulter, on January 29, 1892. The PV&C; acquired the MR&SR; later that year and extended the branch in 1902. The MR&SR; was merged into the PV&C; November 1, 1894. The Peters Creek branch, near Peters Creek, PA, was built in 1893-1894. It was extended in 1895, 1901, 1902, and yet again in 1903. The Keister branch, near Waltersburg, PA, was built in 1899-1900. The Monongahela and Washington Railroad Company built a railroad from Monongahela City to Ellsworth, PA in 1899-1900 and a branch to Cokeburg, PA in 1902. The PV&C; merged the line July 1, 1904. On April 1, 1905, the PV&C; was merged into the Pennsylvania Railroad. Currently (as of 2015), the main line of the PV&C; is owned by Norfolk Southern and operates as its Mon Line.

It was opened by Zack Touloupas in 1928 with its original name of Alamance Hot Wienie Lunch.Touloupas, Elizabeth. Touloupas II, Zack. November 11, 2008. The menu began as a blue plate special, but over the years has been changed to focus on hotdogs and hamburgers. The menu has also been expanded to breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Zack Touloupas was born in the northern mountains of Greece in a village called Karpenisi.Touloupas, Elizabeth. Kappas, Yianna. November 19, 2008. He came to America in 1919 and settled in Columbia, South Carolina. He began working at the Capital Cafe, where he heard of a restaurant for sale in Burlington. When he arrived in Burlington with his family of four in 1928, he bought and opened Alamance Hot Wienie Lunch. Alamance Hot Wienie Lunch contained only eight bar stools and four school desks for tables. The seating capacity remained the same until 1960. The original menu was considered a blue plate special and served beef stew, pork chops and hotdogs and hamburgers. The average meal was a meat and two vegetables. Zack Touloupas' quote was, \\"If it tastes good to me, it tastes good to someone else.\\" Over the years, John Touloupas, Zack's son, had helped out at the restaurant and eventually went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and also had a stint in the army during World War II. When John got back from the war in 1946, he joined the business. One of John's main decisions while owning was to renovate the restaurant. In 1960, an expansion project increased the seating to forty-four. This was about the time when regular patrons began to refer to the restaurant as Zack's Hotdogs. In 1971, Sports Illustrated writer Pat Jordan described Zack's as Burlington's \\"most famous restaurant\\" in the book Black Coach, which described the career of Jerome Thomas Evans, the first African-American football coach in the South, who became head football coach and assistant principal at Walter M. Williams High School in 1970 (Black Coach, p. 42). In 1977, John initiated plans to build a new restaurant. These plans consisted of a new building which was on the same block as Alamance Hot Wienie Lunch. The new building was designed by local Burlington architect Vernon Lewis. Construction was completed and a grand opening was held in December 1977. The new restaurant was called Zack's Hotdogs and consisted of eighty seats. In 1978, french fries and ketchup were added to the menu. John Touloupas' son, Zack Touloupas II had begun working in the store around 1963, when he was only five years old. He joined the business soon after he graduated from UNC in 1981. John continued to work for many years, until he was unable to, but still manages to go to breakfast at Zack's every morning. Today, Zack's still serves hotdogs and hamburgers, but has also added cheese dogs and combinations. A cheese dog in terms of Zack's is just a block of cheese in a bun and a combination is a wienie and cheese together. A is also on the menu which is bread and meat combined to make the patty. All of these items can have onions, slaw and chili. The chili is a homemade recipe made by the original Zack. He also created a hot sauce, which is popular with the customers.

Drawing, 1850s, captioned: Residence of C.L. Parish, Jackson, Amador Co. Cal. (click to enlarge) The William J. Paugh House, also known as Rosewall, is a very pure example of a Carpenter Gothic - Gothic Revival house, one of a very few in Northern California. It is located in Jackson, California, in Amador County. It was built in the late 1850s by Charles L. Parish, artist, architect and builder. According to Parish family lore, it was built to impress a school teacher that Charles was in love with, in order to persuade her to marry him. When his intended bride was tragically killed in a \\"runaway accident\\", he raffled the house off, charging one dollar a ticket. He called the raffle \\"The Charles L. Parish Gift and Musical Entertainment Raffle\\". He sold 8,650 tickets around the state in 1860 and 1861. Advertisements appeared in the Amador Ledger-Dispatch and the Sacramento Daily Union.The ad appeared in the Sacramento Daily Union and the Amador Ledger Dispatch from January through March, 1861. accessed at the California State Library, Sacramento, Ca. The house was won in 1861 by Amador County's second Sheriff, Dr. William J. Paugh, who lived there until 1870, when he moved to San Francisco to practice medicine as a physician/surgeon. It was sold at that time to George Snowden Andrews, Jackson Wells Fargo agent from 1857 until 1875.

Margaret, an educated and strong willed woman, lived there until her death in 2001 at 102 years of age, having lived in three centuries.

June 19, 1944 Bensonhurst, Brooklyn - July, 1980 Borough Park, Brooklyn), was a former Colombo crime family associate and eventually a Genovese crime family soldier and known hitman who was widely feared for his violent tendencies, which directly contributed to his own murder in 1980. Biography Gerard was 36 when he was murdered by rival members of the Colombo crime family. Gerard was known to the police and criminal associates as an ice-cold killer although he was known as \\"Pappa Bear\\" to his wife and mistresses because of the \\"teddy bear\\" nature he displayed when in their presence, or simply \\"Pap\\" to his criminal associates. He was the son of first generation emigrants from Rocca di Papa, Italy in Bensonhurst where Sammy Gravano, Anthony Casso and Frank DeCicco were all born and raised. Pappa had straight jet-black hair, steady blue-grey eyes, and a severe high cheekboned, triangle-shaped face. His last name \\"Pappa\\" in Italian stands for \\"Pope\\" because documents dating from the twelfth century state his parent's village as Rocca di Papa which stands for Castrum Rocce de Papa (\\"Rock Castle of the Pope\\"), because Pope Eugene III lived in their village. He was well known in the mob-infested neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Staten Island. He had been a member of the notorious street gang called the Rampers, which included Thomas Spero, Joe Vitale, Ralph Spero, James Emma and future Gambino crime family underboss Sammy Gravano. Among the ranks of the street gang he was considered a \\"Ramper senior\\". As a rising hoodlum in organized crime circles he committed armed robbery, burglary, car theft and extortion. He was a fierce street fighter and described as one of the \\"baddest bad asses\\" Brooklyn had ever produced along with his close childhood friend James Emma and Ralph Ronga. It is suspected that Gerard suffered from an antisocial personality disorder and multiple personality disorder with severe violent mood swings. He served under the crime family associate, Carmine Persico and Thomas DiBella before becoming a made man in the Genovese crime family. His son John Pappa would also follow him into the life of crime, in the Colombo crime family. Shootout with the Gallos In the early 1960s, during the Profaci-Gallo civil war in the Colombo crime family had an encounter with Gerard, Sammy Gravano, James 'Jimmy' Emma, Joe Vitale, Tommy Snake and Lenny the Mole including a bunch of other gang members. They were hanging around in a bar at 79th Street and New Utrecht Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. In the bar were several Gallo loyalists. They were a lot older than the Rampers and had an outstanding argument with member James Emma. They were heavily armed so Gerry and the others loaded up with firearms and headed back to the bar. Sammy later recounted the brutal gun battle in his autobiography, :It was a long bar. They were at one end of the bar and we were at the other end. It seemed like one of them went for a gun. We went for guns. There were a ton of shots thrown back and forth. It was like a cowboy movie. Totally unbelievable. Glass breaking, women screaming, things falling on the floor. One of the Gallo guys got hit, like eleven times. He staggers out of the bar and falls in the street. And lived, believe it or not. Another guy in the bar, an innocent bystander got hit in the foot. He went on his own to a doctor and never said nothing. The Gallo guy at the hospital don't say nothing, either. He was involved in burglaries of local commercial franchises, fencing stolen goods, armed robbery and car theft. Rescuing Gravano and \\"Joe Vitale\\" While a member of the Rampers with Gravano and others, he rescued Sammy Gravano and fellow Ramper \\"Joe V. (otherwise known as Joe Vitale)'s life, who was nearly fatally shot in the abdomen during a bungled car theft in Bensonhurst. He bandaged up Joe V. who was bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound to the side and thought to be in critical condition. Sammy thought that he had been shot in the head. The two gang members had been shot by a distraught citizen who was attempting to pursue Pappa and the others for stealing his car. He drove Joe Vitale to Coney Island Hospital where he dropped himself out front of the emergency ward. Afterward, he drove Gravano to a doctor who practiced in Upstate New York that could be relied upon for discretion. According to Gerard's doctor associate, he discovered that the bullet instead of entering his brain, had grazed Gravano's temple taking off a small shard of skull behind and slightly above his ear. In the hospital, due to Gerard's rescue efforts, Joe Vitale miraculously survived his nearly fatal gunshot wound. The breaking point for Pappa He was washing his car on a street in Bensonhurst when his close friend and fellow Ramper James Emma was gunned down by contract killers from the Colombo crime family sent on orders by Colombo crime family capo Dominick Scialo. The gunmen then turned their guns on Gerard. At that exact moment, a car was passing and Pappa dove in through an open window. The driver of the car was so overcome with fear that he did not notice Gerard in the backseat and sped off. The murder of James Emma was considered the breaking point for Gerard. He was taken down to the precinct as a witness to the shooting of Emma. Gravano was later shown papers revealing that his friend had filed paperwork for a protection order with the New York City Police Department. Sammy was outraged at his friend's act of perceived betrayal. Gravano stated, \\"Our relationship and friendship and everything died from that point on.\\" He became the subject of many sitdowns between the Gambino crime family and Colombo crime family for his wanton acts of senseless violence that he displayed but was always given a \\"pass\\" and allowed to live because of his efficiency as a contract killer. Gangland slaying On July 1980 Gerard was shot to death in the Villa Sixty- Six Restaurant on Fourteenth Avenue and 66th Street in Brooklyn by a Colombo hit squad. It was for revenge of carrying out the murder of Colombo crime family capo Thomas \\"Shorty\\" Spero, the uncle of Angelo Sepe. He was murdered by Dominick Cataldo and his nephews Nicholas and Joseph Cataldo Jr., the sons of Colombo crime family mafioso Joseph Cataldo. Knowing how hard Gerard would be to kill, that he was always armed, very fast and very game, they were hiding in the luncheonette's rear kitchen when he arrived. They approached him from behind and shot him in the head with a sawed-off shotgun, literally blowing his head to pieces. He was killed instantly. Sammy Gravano would later speak of feeling great sadness and remorse for the loss of his childhood friend. Genovese crime family mob boss Vincent Gigante was suspected of handing down the murder contract, but was acquitted of his alleged involvement in the murder in 1997.

The waves may be caused by natural movement of the water, or by the movement of birds or animals in the water. Even a ripple from a thrown rock will create a momentary glitter. Light reflects from smooth surfaces by specular reflection. A rippled but locally smooth surface such as water with waves will reflect the sun at different angles at each point on the surface of the waves. As a result, a viewer in the right position will see many small images of the sun, formed by portions of waves that are oriented correctly to reflect the sun's light to the viewer's eyes. The exact pattern seen depends on the viewer's precise location. The color and the length of the glitter depend on the altitude of the Sun. The lower the sun appears, the longer and more reddish the glitter is. When the sun is really low above the horizon, the glitter breaks because of the waves, which could sometimes obstruct the sun and cast a shadow on the glitter. Sun glitter can be bright enough to damage one's eyes. Caution should be exercised while observing the glitter. Sun glitter is observed on other planetary bodies with surface liquids, namely Titan. Titan hosts lakes and seas of liquid methane at its north polar region. Sun glitter was discovered on Titan's smallest sea, Punga Mare, in 2014 as a set of brightened pixels at infrared wavelengths across Punga Mare's bright sea surface. The glitter was likely caused by springtime winds. Sun glitter has also been observed in the largest sea, Kraken Mare, during the northern summer. Tidal currents in narrow straits and summer winds were the probable causes of the Kraken sun glitter.

Mario Balzic is the protagonist, an atypical detective for the genre, a Serbo-Italian American cop, middle-aged, unpretentious, a family man who asks questions and uses more sense than force. The novel tells the story of a double robbery in two identical apartments, rented but hardly ever used by a Pittsburgh drug dealer who's clean with the law. A young woman is found shot dead on the street, she cannot be identified but her murder has all the appearances of a professional hit. The new mayor of Rocksburg is near hysteria, and he smears the case all over Balzic, who not only has to solve the murder but teach his nosy new boss the not-so-plain facts of police work.

They are used to supplement the sound of tweeters by reproducing frequencies which the tweeter may produce only with a narrow polar output, or perhaps with distortion. A super tweeter is generally intended to respond well into ultrasonic frequencies over 20 kHz, the commonly accepted upper frequency limit of human hearing.

The film stars mostly amateur actors with only Kimiko Ikegami and Y≈çko Minamida having any notable previous acting experience. The film is about a schoolgirl traveling with her six classmates to her ailing aunt's country home, where they come face to face with supernatural events as the girls are, one by one, devoured by the home. The film company Toho approached Obayashi with the suggestion to make a film like Jaws. Influenced by ideas from his daughter Chigumi, Obayashi developed ideas for a script that was written by Chiho Katsura. After the script was green-lit, the film was put on hold for two years as no director at Toho wanted to direct it. Obayashi promoted the film during this time period until the studio allowed him to direct it himself. The film was a box office hit in Japan but received negative reviews from critics. House received a wide release in 2009 and 2010 in North America, where it received more favorable reviews.  Plot  In Japan, a young girl known as Gorgeous, so called for her beauty, has plans for a summer vacation with her father who had been in Italy scoring film music. Her father returns home and surprises Gorgeous by announcing she has a new stepmother, Ryoko Ema. This upsets Gorgeous, whose mother had died eight years earlier. Gorgeous goes to her bedroom and writes a letter to her aunt asking to come visit her for the summer instead. Gorgeous' aunt replies and allows her to come visit. Gorgeous invites her six friends, Prof, who is highly academic and very good at problem solving; Melody, who has an affinity for music; Kung Fu, who is athletic and especially skilled at kung fu; Mac, who is highly gluttonous and loves to eat; Sweet, who is bubbly and gentle; and Fantasy, who is a constant daydreamer, to come along with her. On arriving at the aunt's house, the girls are greeted by Gorgeous' aunt, to whom they present a watermelon. After a tour of the home, the girls leave the watermelon in a well to keep it cold. Mac later goes to retrieve the watermelon and does not return. When Fantasy goes to retrieve the watermelon from the well, she finds Mac's head, which flies in the air and bites Fantasy's buttocks before she escapes. The other girls also begin to encounter other supernatural traps throughout the house. The aunt disappears after entering the broken refrigerator, and the girls are attacked or possessed by a series of items in the house, such as Gorgeous becoming possessed after using her aunt's mirror and Sweet disappearing after being attacked by mattresses. The girls try to escape the house, but after Gorgeous is able to leave through a door, the rest of the girls find themselves locked in. The girls try to find the aunt to unlock the door but discover Mac's severed hand in a jar. Melody begins to play the piano to keep the girls' spirits up and they hear Gorgeous singing upstairs. As Prof and Kung Fu go to investigate, Melody's fingers are bitten off by the piano, and it ultimately eats her whole. Upstairs in the house, Kung Fu and Prof find Gorgeous wearing a bridal gown, who then reveals her aunt's diary to them. Kung Fu follows Gorgeous as she leaves the room, only to find Sweet's body trapped in a grandfather clock. Panic-driven, the remaining girls barricade the upper part of the house while Prof, Fantasy and Kung Fu read the aunt's diary. They are interrupted by the giant-sized head of Gorgeous, who reveals that her aunt died many years ago waiting for her fianc√©e to return from World War II and that her spirit remains, eating unmarried girls who arrive at her home. The three girls are then attacked by household items. Prof shouts to Kung Fu to attack the aunt's cat, Blanche. As Kung Fu lunges into a flying kick, she is eaten by a possessed light fixture. Kung Fu's legs manage to escape and damage the painting of Blanche on the wall, which in turn kills Blanche physically. The attacked Blanche portrait spurts blood, causing the room to flood. Prof tries to read the diary, but a jar with teeth pulls her into the blood, where she dissolves. Fantasy sees Gorgeous in the bridal gown and paddles towards her. Gorgeous appears as her aunt in the reflection in the blood and then cradles Fantasy. In the morning, Ryoko arrives at the house and finds Gorgeous in a classic kimono. Gorgeous tells Ryoko that her friends will wake up soon and that they will be hungry. She then shakes hands with Ryoko and burns her away to nothing.

To find inspiration for the story, Obayashi discussed ideas with his pre-teen daughter Chigumi Obayashi. Nobuhiko sought her ideas, believing that adults \\"only think about things they understand ... everything stays on that boring human level\\" while \\"children can come up with things that can't be explained\\". Several of Chigumi's ideas were included in House such as a reflection in a mirror attacking the viewer, a watermelon being pulled out of a well appearing like a human head, and a house that eats girls. Other themes Chigumi suggested drew upon her own childhood fears. These fears included a pile of futons falling on her that felt like a monster attacking her, a large loud clock at her grandparents home, and getting her fingers caught in between her piano keys. Nobuhiko shared these story ideas with screenwriter Chiho Katsura. These ideas reminded Katsura of a short story by Walter de la Mare about an old woman who is visited by her granddaughters who then puts them in a trunk. Obayashi incorporated themes of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki into the script. Obayashi was born in Hiroshima and lost all his childhood friends from these bombings. Obayashi applied these themes with the plot element of a woman's ghost waiting for her lover's return from World War II. The woman's bitterness about the war turns her into an evil spirit that devours the girls who were unaffected by the bombings. Obayashi and Katsura had worked previously on a script titled Hanagatami before being assigned to House, which made the screenwriting process easy for both of them. Obayashi titled the script House as he felt that a foreign title for a Japanese film would be \\"taboo\\".  Pre-production  The script for House was green-lit shortly after being presented to Toho. No directors at Toho were interested in directing the film as they felt it would end their career. Obayashi proposed that he would direct it but was turned down as he was not a staff member at Toho. House did not start filming until two years after the script's completion. Toho allowed Obayashi to announce that the film had been green-lit and began promoting the film by passing out business cards which advertised the film. In the 1960s, Obayashi created a short film titled Emotion that was popular at Japanese universities and event halls. Fans of his television commercial and film work helped him promote House before it was even in production. Products based on House that were released included manga, a novelization of the script and a radio drama. The soundtrack for the film was created and released before the film was made. The majority of the cast of House were not established actors, with many having primarily only worked with Obayashi on his commercials and independent films. During the two-year waiting period to start filming House, Obayashi created several commercials and began casting the seven girls from models who were in his commercials. The most experienced members of the main cast were Kimiko Ikegami and Y≈çko Minamida. Obayashi was friends with Minamida who he filmed in commercials for Calpis. Minamida was mostly working television and theater at the time and worried that taking the role of the older woman would have a negative effect on the roles she would be subsequently offered, but still agreed to play the part. The country music singer Kiyohiko Ozaki, who plays Mr. Togo in the film, was cast because he was friends with Obayashi through their shared hobby of horseback riding. Other roles were filled by members of the crew and their families; for example, Nobuhiko Obayashi's daughter Chigumi plays the little girl, and the film's production designer plays the shoe maker. The soundtrack for the film was created and released before the film's production. Asei Kobayashi, who worked with Obayashi on his television commercials, contributed the piano pieces for the film's soundtrack. Kobayashi felt that younger people should contribute to the film's soundtrack and suggested Mickie Yoshino and his band Godiego should contribute songs based on Yoshino's piano pieces.  Filming  alt=A cartoon like image of a grinning cat leaps out of a picture of Blanche in the aunt's house Obayashi recalled that his producer told him that Toho was tired of losing money on comprehensible films and were ready to let Obayashi direct the House script, which they felt was incomprehensible. Toho officially green-lit the film's production after the success of the radio drama based on House. Obayashi received special permission to direct the film despite not being a member of the Toho staff. House was filmed on one of Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a storyboard over a period of about two months. Obayashi described the attitude on the set as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses on the set. Despite having fun on the set, members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got into the spirit of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off her clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script. Obayashi already had experience with special effects from his work on television commercials. Obayashi and the cameraman oversaw the special effects for the film. Obayashi desired the special effects to look unrealistic, as if a child created them. For the scene in which Ai Matsubara's character vanishes under the blood, Obayashi had her suspended nude, pouring buckets of blue paint on her to create a blue-screen chroma key effect where the blue colored parts of her body would deteriorate on camera. The outcome of a lot of these effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated that sometimes the effects did not turn out how he originally envisioned them.  Release  House was first released on 30 July 1977 in Japan, where it was distributed by Toho. It was originally released as a double feature with the romance film Pure Hearts in Mud. Toho did not expect House to be successful, but the film became a commercial hit, becoming specifically popular with a youth audience. House was not officially screened in the United States until the distribution rights were bought by Janus Films to be released as part of their Eclipse line of DVDs. The Eclipse brand was originally conceived as a possible sub-label for cult films released by the Criterion Collection. Janus soon began getting requests for theatrical screenings of the film. Janus initiated a small tour of theatrical showings, including two sold-out shows at the 2009 New York Asian Film Festival. In January 2010, a remastered print of House by Janus began being shown theatrically across North America, with the first of the showings taking place at the IFC Center in New York City. House was released by the Masters of Cinema label in the United Kingdom on DVD. Bonus features on the disc included interviews with the cast and crew and the theatrical trailer. House was released by the Criterion Collection on DVD and Blu-ray on 26 October 2010. Bonus features on the disc include a making-of featurette that features interviews with the crew; director Obayashi's short film Emotion, which was first released in 1966; an appreciation video featuring American filmmaker Ti West; and a promotional trailer for House.  Reception  The film did not receive many reviews in Japan on its initial release. The general reception among Japanese critics who did review the film was negative. Nobuhiko Obayashi won the Blue Ribbon Award for Best New Director in 1978 for House, and, on House theatrical screenings across North America, the film began to receive generally favorable reviews. House was The New York Times critics pick stating that \\"Mr. Obayashi has created a true fever dream of a film, one in which the young female imagination ‚Äì that of his daughter, Gorgeous or both ‚Äì yields memorable results.\\" The Seattle Times gave House three out of four stars, stating that what the film \\"lacks in technical wizardry it more than makes up for in playful ingenuity, injecting cheesy effects into outrageously stylized set pieces.\\" Slant Magazine gave the film three stars out of four, calling it \\"equal parts brilliant, baffling, ridiculous, and unwatchable.\\" The New York Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four, praising the film's originality, comparing it to the work of directors Dario Argento and Guy Maddin. indieWire included House in their list of \\"Haunted House films worth discussing\\" calling it \\"the cheeriest, most infectious blood bath in cinematic history.\\" In 2009, the Japanese film magazine Kinema Junpo placed House at number 160 on their list of top 200 Japanese films. Richard Whittaker of The Austin Chronicle gave House a mixed review, saying that \\"there's surprisingly little to recommend House as a film. But as an experience, well, that's a whole other story.\\" Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice gave the film a mixed review as well, saying that \\"Contemporary Japanese pop culture makes the hophead nonsense of House look quaint by comparison... though it plays like a retarded hybrid of Rocky Horror and Whispering Corridors, it is, moment to moment, its own kind of movie hijinks.\\" Tom Russo of The Boston Globe gave the film two stars out of four, opining that films by Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson had attempted similar styled films with more success.

He then gives up shooting and turns his energy to gardening instead.The Twelfth and After, chapters 2 to 5 Honours and clubs Hysteron-Proteron was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1918, for military services.

SDI used to market under Soundesign, a now-defunct brand. SDI Technologies had 110 employees as of 2007, and has a distribution network that covers over 70 countries. Including Asia, SDI employs over 400 people. History SDI Technologies was founded as Realtone Electronics in 1956 by Saul Ashkenazi. In that year, the company introduced one of the first pocket cigarette lighters and one of the first transistor radios. Realtone went public in 1961. It introduced the Soundesign brand of high-end audio components in 1963, and the company changed its name to Soundesign in 1968. Soundesign returned to being a privately-held company in 1982. The company was renamed again, this time to its current name, in 1994. Products Soundesign Soundesign, a defunct division of SDI Technologies originally known as RealTone, marketed inexpensive home and portable electronics. The Soundesign brand faded as SDI began selling its products under the Zenith brand in 1993. SDI's current offerings include small electronics of the iHome and Timex brands. iHome Created in 2005, the iHome division produces docking stations, headphones, smart home devices, and other accessories. iHome speakers are able to stream music over Apple AirPlay, Bluetooth, as well as via a wired connection. In addition to playing music wirelessly, some systems can act as a charging station for many devices when connected.

According to the excavator Ali Abu Assaf, it was in existence from 1300 BC until 740 BC and remained \\"basically the same\\" during the period of the Solomonic Temple's construction (1000‚Äì900 BC) as it had been before, so that it predates the Solomon Temple. The temples of Emar, Mumbaqa, and Ebla (Temple D) are also comparable, as is the nearby 8th-century Tell Tayinat temple. The surviving sculptures depict lions and sphinxes (comparable to the cherubim of the First Temple). Massive footprints were carved into the floor; whether of giants, humans or animals is debatable. Also left to speculation is to whom the temple is dedicated. Ain Dara may have been devoted to Ishtar, goddess of fertility, or to the related female goddess Astarte. It also might have been dedicated to the deity Ba'al Hadad; or it might have been an oracle temple on a road known as \\"the international highway\\" between the Syrian Desert and Mediterranean Sea. In late January 2018, the temple was significantly damaged by Turkish Air Force jets in the course of their Afrin offensive.Syrian government says Turkish shelling damaged ancient temple Reports indicate that at least 60% percent of the structure was reduced to rubble.Turkish bombing damages 3,000-year-old temple in northern Syria Viewing photos and video released online, one can see that the entire front facade of the temple has been destroyed. The site's emblematic basalt lion was stolen in December 2019 by members of the al-Hamzat militia, a part of the Syrian National Army. Geography Ain Dara temple is located in north Syria, northwest of Aleppo near the Syro-Turkish border. It was built on a terrace known as the \\"acropolis of the tell\\". The tell itself is precipitous-faced and overlooks the Afrin Valley. The area is divided in two parts, the main tell that is above the surrounding plain, and the lower acropolis which covers an area of . Just east of the temple site is the modern-day village of Ain Dara. History of excavation Colossal basalt lion found in 1955 The discovery of the temple was the result of a fortuitous finding of a colossal basalt lion in 1955. Excavations in 1956, 1962, and 1964 were conducted by Maurice Dunand and Feisal Seirafi; beginning in 1976, Ali Abu Assaf continued the work. History of the tell and temple The earliest habitation signs on the tell are from the Chalcolithic period during the fourth millennium BC, and the tell remained occupied until the Ottoman period (1517 -1917). Ali Abu Assaf discovered the temple and inferred that it was built in three structural phases in the period from about 1300 BC to 740 BC. The first phase was from 1300‚Äì1000 BC, the second phase from 1000‚Äì900 BC, and third phase from 900‚Äì740 BC. Architecture and fittings General outline Ain Dara Temple before the Turkish bombing destroyed it in early 2018. Detail of the outer wall of the Ain Dara temple, showing two lions The Ain Dara temple, as excavated, has revealed a three-part layout with structural blocks of basalt on limestone foundations. However, it has been conjectured that the temple probably had a mud-brick superstructure covered with wood paneling, which has not survived. Exterior A courtyard built with sandstones provides the approach to the temple. The courtyard is paved with flagstones where a chalkstone basin for ceremonial purposes is seen. The temple, in size, faces southeast. Its exterior contains a cherubim relief. The entrance porch, or portico, marked by two basalt piers or pillars, and a wide hall, were not roofed over and were part of an open courtyard. The entrance pillars appear to have architectural and cultic significance. A sphinx and two lions decorate the temple portico flanking the three steps (out of four) made from basalt. Interior The main sections include the porch, a middle room and an inner room or sanctum. The middle room is by in area and is lined with lion reliefs, guilloch√©, and panels resembling windows. The square main hall is by ; at the rear end of this hall reliefs and a stele were added as part of shrine. There are basalt reliefs in the lower wall panels. An elevated podium ( high platform), a niche, and a secondary wall are part of the visible remains. In the small shrine area situated at the innermost area of the temple, the wall has carved sockets and grooves, which point to the former presence of a wooden screen. A ramp joins the main room to the platform area and the sanctum. The back wall of the sanctum has a niche which probably housed a statue of a god or goddess. Paved floors and walls reliefs are visible in the multistoried hallways, at least three stories high, that flank three sides of the temple, with at least one southern entrance. Figure-eight lattice patterns are included on two false, recessed windows that were carved into the temple walls. While all these were dated as part of first and second phase creations, material remains unearthed at the site identify additions made in the third phase of construction, an \\"ambulatory with a series of side chambers on three sides of the temple\\". It has also been inferred that these chambers were part of the pre-existing temple platform and not linked to the main temple. Footprints A pair of large, bare footprints, each about in length, are carved into the stone floors of the portico, followed by a single footprint carved beyond the first two, and another single footprint carved into the threshold, \\"marking the deity‚Äôs procession into the cella\\". It is also conjectured that these foot prints could be of unidentified \\"immense clawed creatures\\". The inference is that the right footprint seen on the threshold, which is spaced at about from the first footprint, could be of human or goddess, in height. Monson has also noted that the deities in all the Ain Dara temple reliefs have \\"shoes with curled-up toes\\". Hence, the source of the footprints, whether of gods or humans or animals, is debatable. Similarities with Solomon's Temple Conceptual sketch of elevation of Solomon's Temple as explained in the Hebrew Bible After the 1980‚Äì1985 excavations, the similarities between the temple at Ain Dara with Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, as described in the Biblical texts though not seen on ground, were discussed by archaeologists and historians. Already the smaller 8th-century Tell Tayinat temple, discovered during excavations in 1936 and located about away, had \\"caused a sensation because of its similarities to Solomon‚Äôs Temple.\\" There are many features in common with Solomon's Temple as described in the Book of Kings. The layout of Dara is similar to that of the Biblical temple, which was also of a long room plan with the three-room configuration of a portico at the entrance followed by the main chamber with the shrine. The difference is in the antechamber, which is an add-on in the Ain Dara temple. The size of the Solomon temple was by while that of the Ain Dara is long by wide without side chambers. Other similarities include: location on a high raised site overlooking a city; erected on a raised platform, with a narrow portico and a roof supported on pillars flanked by reliefs on the walls, and carvings of similar motifs; and the raised podium. In brief, 33 of the architectural elements found in Ain Dara are tallied with 65 of the features mentioned in the Biblical description of Solomon's Temple. Destruction in 2018‚Äì2019 Destruction by Turkish military in 2018 In late January 2018, both the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums and pro- rebel Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported major destruction of the temple following airstrikes by the Turkish Air Force in the course of their Afrin offensive. Aerial bombardments of the Ain Dara site were first reported by a local resident via Dutch news network NOS on 23 January 2018. As reported on MSN news, with the headline \\"Blown to bits\\", it is clear the temple was heavily damaged. \\"For 3,000 years, the lion sculptures of Syria's Ain Dara stood as testaments to the Iron Age. But as Turkish bombardment pounds the region, they have little left but their paws.\\" As stated by the Directorate of Antiquities in Afrin on 31 January 2018: > \\"Turkish forces revealed the occupation of Syrian geography in its real > face, especially the Turkish state, since the declaration of war on Afrin > canton on 20 January 2018, as it escalated Operation Olive Branch to go > beyond the targeting of military forces to include shelling villages and > towns full of civilians from the elderly, children and women To the rich and > varied history and civilization of the province from prehistoric times to > the present day.\\" > \\"On 27 January 2018, the Turkish state warplanes bombarded and damaged the > ancient \\"Ein -Darat\\" temple, despite its distance from the fighting fronts > and the areas of engagement, by about 20 kilometers. Accordingly, the > Directorate of Antiquities in Afrin canton and all the bodies and councils > associated with Democratic Autonomous Administration and civil institutions > condemn this savage shelling of sites and archaeological sites that are the > property of all mankind. We call on the international community and all > organizations involved in this field to intervene immediately, seriously and > Turkish Cultural and Human Heritage in Afrin canton\\". The Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums and Syrian Ministry of Culture issued a statement condemning the attack on the site as \\"aggression of the Turkish regime on archaeological sites in the northern countryside of Aleppo\\" and called on international organizations to denounce the attack on Ain Dara. BBC News reported that \\"Turkey is indiscriminately shelling civilians in Afrin\\" where Ain Dara is located. More than 2,200 people have been \\"neutralized\\" in the Afrin region of Syria as part of Turkey's ongoing military operations there, Turkish authorities said 1 March 2018. The Turkish Armed Forced used the term \\"neutralized\\" to describe capturing enemies dead or alive, or those who have surrendered to Ankara forces. Basalt lion stolen by Turkish-backed group, former ISIS terrorists in 2019 In early December 2019, Al-Hamzat backed by Turkish forces, took part in Operation Peace Spring, journeying out to eventually plunder the already Turkish-bombed disaster area of 'Ain Dara's archaeological site. It was reported across multiple news outlets including the Syrian information news network of SANA, that this group also carried out illegal excavations in the areas of Afrin and looted facilities near Ras al-Ayn in the Al-Hasakah region of Northeast Syria. The giant basalt Lion which was stolen in December 2019 by Turkish backed Syrian rebels. The basalt lion sculpture, which was discovered in 1956, like the Ain Dara temple itself, is now gone: > \\"On December 20th [2019], the Turkish army and its mercenaries attacked > Afrin with tanks, artillery and jets causing massive destruction of the > city....Recent footage of a military exercise by a pro-Turkish militia > (National Liberation Front) who established a shooting range against the > archaeological hill of Ain Dara in the occupied Afrin province invaded and > controlled by Turkish forces and their proxy militias last year, revealed > the tragic disappearance of the famous historical masterpiece known as The > Lion of Afrin. Ain Dara itself was targeted by Turkish jets in 2018 as > Turkish units and their proxy forces advanced on the area known for its > archaeological wealth that featured one of the world's oldest temples often > compared in significance to the Temple of Solomon... The disappearance of > the Lion of Afrin marks another war crime against Syrian history and > humanity at large.\\" Looting groups backed by the Turkish military Before the tragic archaeological loss occurred, the Washington DC based VOAA news agency reported al-Hamzat's role in the Turkish offensive on 9 October 2019: > \\"Ahmed Rahal, a former Syrian military general... said \\"Rebel groups such as > _...al-Hamzat Division_ ... _will play a MAJOR role in capturing towns_ that > currently are under the control of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a > military alliance of Arab and Kurdish fighters.\\" \\"Despite a U.S.-Turkish > agreement in August to establish a buffer zone in northern Syria between > Turkish forces and Kurdish YPG fighters, Turkey had been threatening for > months to invade Syria's northeast. ...The main objective for these rebel > forces is to make certain that U.S.-backed forces \\"such as the SDF have no > role in the future of Syria.\\" The Hamzat Division, founded in April 2016 in Turkey, was one of the first Turkish-backed Syrian groups that entered the Syrian town of Jarablus in 2017 alongside the Turkish military. In March 2018, Turkish military and allied Syrian rebels took control of the Kurdish-majority town of Afrin in northwestern Syria. In October 2019, after the United States withdrawal from northern Syria, the Turkish backed SNA was formed after a merger of several Turkish-backed Syrian rebel groups formed to discipline their forces after Major Abuses and War Crimes were exposed in Afrin by the United Nations earlier in February. Warnings gone by as careless and/or deliberate destruction continues U.N. organizations and human rights groups have heavily warned since February 2019 that Turkish backed rebel forces were carrying out systematic violent and deadly attacks against Kurdish civilians in Afrin. ‚ÄúThe commission finds there are reasonable grounds to believe that armed group members in Afrin committed the war crimes of hostage-taking, cruel treatment, torture, and pillage,‚Äù the United Nations report said. Further, Philippe Nassif, director for the Nobel Prize organization, Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International warned: \\"A Turkish assault on northeastern Syria, a country ravaged by war and a humanitarian crisis, would likely cause massive civilian harm and further displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians [creating] a new refugee crisis on top of the one that has already led to over 5 million Syrians fleeing their country would be a tragedy of epic proportions.\\" Despite multiple warnings, no international steps were taken by any nation, to protect Ain Dara, which is a loss for all human history. On 11 October 2019, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also warned and reported that members of al-Hamzat were former ISIS terrorists who kidnapped and murdered locals: > \\"One of the elements of the Turkish-backed faction was a person working with > a leader in (al-Farouk al-Islami) faction and then became the Emir of the > Islamic State in Welayat Homs, as they call it...They were members of the > Islamic State and then moved to Al-Bab and joined the ranks of the al-Hamzat > Division. When they were exposed, they were dismissed without accountability > as if they had sinned and forgiven. We still receive threats from this gang > while we are in Turkish territory.\\" Turkish bombing of Afrin, Syria. The end of Ain Dara and the ancient basalt lion After months of warnings, on 17 December 2019, the Prensa Latina news source detailed the looting of Ain Dara, reporting: > \\"...these elements carried out illegal excavations in areas of the town of > Afrin, in the north of Aleppo and looted properties and facilities in the > village of Tal Mohammed and near that of Ras Al Ayn, in that of Hasaka. > Various sources also indicated that in the village of Joga, near the > aforementioned Afrin, terrorists of the Al Hamzat organization seized a > Basalt Lion at the Archaeological site of Ain Dara\\"... In early December the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights again reported on the al-hamzat group stating: > \\"...the militants have been systematically looting antiquities in the Afrin > district, particularly in the city of al-Nabi Hori ‚Äì also known as Korsh ‚Äì > ever since Turkish military forces and their Syrian proxies launched an > operation to push Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militants away > from a \\"safe zone\\" along Syria's border with Turkey... The SOHR highlighted > that Turkish-affiliated militants, namely members of the so-called Soqoor > al-Shamal terror group, have been carrying out indiscriminate excavations by > heavy machinery in the area... The operations have also led to the > destruction of fragile historical artifacts such as glassware, porcelain > ware, pottery and mosaic paintings. On 6 November 2019, a worker at an > illegal excavation site posted on Facebook pictures of three mosaics and > other artifacts. ..The paintings, nevertheless, strongly indicated that they > have been recovered from a mountainous site controlled by Turkish-backed > militants.\\" There are many tell [archaeological mound] sites in the surrounding area, such as Tall SulaymƒÅnƒ´, which in Arabic means \\"Tell of Solomon\\". Furthermore, to the east also is Qamishli, the second largest city in the al-Hasakah Governorate, which was home to a significant Jewish community in ancient times. It was also the modern center of Syriac Christianity, formed after the 1915 Assyrian Genocide, which followed the Armenian and Greek Genocides perpetrated against the Syrian Christians during WWI. An estimated 20,000 Christians left the city of Qamishli after the 2011 Syrian War erupted. Qamishli is situated at the base of the Taurus Mountains, located near the area of ancient Hurrian city of Urkesh, which was founded during the 3000 BC era. Excavations have been on hold during the Syrian War since 2011, but unlike Ain Dara, the Urkesh site is protected by Kurdish YPG troops since 2016. Additionally, in the town of Urkesh, the copper Louvre lion and accompanying stone tablet bearing the earliest known text in Hurrian was discovered, dating to the Akkadian period of 2300 ‚Äì 2159 BC. A second, copper lion found there, is on permanent exhibit in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Tajikistan has rich deposits of gold, silver, and antimony. The largest silver deposits are in Sughd Province, where Tajikistan's largest gold mining operation also is located. Russia's Norilsk nickel company has explored a large new silver deposit at Bolshoy Kanimansur. More than 400 mineral deposits of some 70 different minerals have been discovered in Tajikistan, including strontium, tungsten, molybdenum, bismuth, salt, lead, zinc, fluorspar, and mercury. These minerals have been found suitable for mining. Uranium, an important mineral in the Soviet era, remains in some quantity but is no longer extracted. The Tajikistan Aluminium Company (TALCO), an aluminium smelter, is the country's only large-scale production enterprise in the mining sector. Tajikistan hosts the annual Mining World Tajikistan, an international exhibition on mining in Dushanbe. History Mine equipment destroyed during the civil war in Tajikistan The mining industry reached a notable level in the 9th‚Äì11th centuries, visible by ancient mining openings and metallurgical operations. These are evident in the Karamazar Mountains' Mansura mine, in the Kondara Ore Gorge, the Koninukra Silver Mine, Pamir, Darvaza, Kukhilal, and the Lyadzhvardara Lazurite Gorge. The archaeologist Mikhail Evgenievich Masson explored early mining sites in the eastern Tajikistan mountains. Rare metals were not mined in Tajikistan before the World War II. The output of concentrates of rare metals in 1943, however, exceeded that of 1941 by sixty times, and that of 1942 by ten times. No copper, molybdenum, tungsten, or zinc has been produced in recent years and mining activity since the 1990s has been severely disrupted due to civil war and political conflict. Mineral exports contribute substantially to the national economy of Tajikistan. According to the 2008 statistics of the World Bank, aluminium contributed about 50% to the national exchequer, with aluminium and cotton accounting for 9% of the gross domestic product. Minerals Gold Gold mining in Tajikistan is significant to the world mineral market. According to estimates from the Tajik Academy of Sciences, gold deposits are estimated at 429.3 tonnes. Tajikistan's largest gold mining operation is located in Sughd Province, with most gold being mined southeast of Gharm, in the Pamir Mountains, in the Yakhsu Valley, Chkalovsk, and Jilau. It has taken off since independence from Russia with of gold mined in 2000 compared to 1,100 in 1996. The Darvaz joint venture, in the Hatlon region of Eastern Tajikistan, did exploit the gold from 1997 to 1999, producing 110 kilograms (kg) of gold in 1997. However, operational problems arose following damage to the placer mining operation that took place during hostilities in the area in December 1996. Mills and the living quarters at the facility were damaged as result of the hostilities. As of 2011, Tajikistan produces up to 1.3‚Äì1.5 tonnes of gold annually, with a significant investment from China, with Zijin Mining working in the country. In January 2011, according to geologist Azim Ibrokhim, two massive gold deposits were discovered, one in the centre of the country contains 118 tonnes and the other in the north, which is believed to have 59 tonnes of gold. Tajikistan plans to produce 2,441 kg of gold by the end of the year 2012. Silver Proven silver reserves at Big Kon-i Mansur (⁄©ŸÑÿßŸÜ ⁄©ÿßŸÜ ŸÖŸÜÿµŸàÿ±) were determined during the Soviet era at about 50,000 tonnes, according to Tajikistan's Main Directorate of Geology (MDG). That total equals about 49g of silver per tonne of ore. The same tonne contains 480g of lead and 380g of zinc. The deposit has 1 billion tonnes of ore. The silver deposit is the world's second largest, according to the Tajik government. The world's most productive silver mine is Cannington, a BHP Billiton property in Australia. However, Soviet-era projections took only the most conservative estimates into account, geologists say; the ore could be richer than the Soviet estimates. Aluminium TALCO plant in Tursunzade The Tajikistan Aluminium Company (TALCO; previously TadAZ, \\"Tajikistan Aluminium Smelter\\"), an aluminium smelter, is Tajikistan's only large-scale production enterprise in the mining sector, and runs one of the world's largest aluminium manufacturing plants, located in Tursunzade, in the country's western area. Its production capacity is reported to be 517,000 t/year (accounting for consumption of 40% of electrical energy generated in the country) and most of it is exported with only about 5000 t/year consumed within the country. As of 2006, the company was responsible for some 416,000 tonnes of aluminium in their ball mills, connected to two 500 kW 6 kV motors. Tajikistan's extensive aluminium processing industry depends entirely on imported ore. Uranium Uranium and graphite was formerly exploited by the Soviets, northeast of Khudzhand, but this industry has now diminished. At its peak, the industry produced approximately 170 tonnes of waste rock annually. The State Enterprise \\"Eastern Combine for Rare Metals\\" (IA Vostokredmet) has estimated that Tajikistan still has some 55 tonnes of uranium reserves remaining. Vostokredmet established a plant in Chkalovsk in 1945, known as the Leninabad Mining and Chemical Combine, now Industrial Association \\"Eastern Combine for Rare Metals\\" (IA Vostokredmet), and the centre of the uranium industry in the Tajik SSR until it ceased in 1992. Other Hambergite (a type of borate) mined in the Pamir Mountains Mercury was mined at the Dzhizhikrutskoye deposit, north of Dushanbe. Antimony was extracted at Isfara and Dzhizhikrutskoye (2,000 tonnes in 2000); and arsenic, cadmium, tungsten, and lead-zinc in the Yuzhno-Yangikanskiy deposit, north of the Zeravshan River. Copper-bismuth, antimony-mercury, and lead-silver ores are also extracted. Antimony deposits are stated to be the largest in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region. Silver deposits have been reported from the northeastern region of Bol'shoy Kanimansur region, which are also considered as one of the largest in the world, apart from being the largest in CIS region. Rare metals reserves of gallium, germanium, indium, selenium, tellurium and thallium have been established; some amount of thallium was mined in the 1990s. Some of the rarer minerals are said to be located in the Zerafshan region. Northern Tajikistan has resources required for construction such as granite, limestone, marble and volcanic tuft. Coal extraction is also reported from Fan-Yagnon and Shurab areas. Strontium deposits have been established in the southern region of Tajikistan in the Chilkultan and Davgir region and these deposits are in the process of commercial exploitation. Deposits of boron, sodium chloride, carbonates, fluorite, precious and semiprecious stones have also been reported. Among the Central Asian republics, Tajikistan ranks first in lead, zinc, and fluorspar resources.

Coal exploitation in the country has been a major contributor to the national economy in recent years with output of hard coal increasing by 39% to 31,200 tonnes, and brown coal increasing by 70% to 15,200 tonnes. The bulk of foreign investment into Tajik mining activities derives from companies from Canada, United States, United Kingdom, Korea, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Hungary and Russia, although compared to some of the other Asian countries, investment is extremely low due to the proximity of Tajikistan to Afghanistan and political barriers. Waste management Heavy metals from mining can be harmful to the environment when left exposed, and failures to manage wastes may cause pollution. Wastes from the Anzob processing plant contain antimony, mercury, and sulfates. Wastes from the Adrasman plant contain cadmium, lead, and zinc. Wastes from the Leninabad rare metals plant contain cobalt, molybdenum, nickel, and tungsten. Wastes from the Takob smelter contain lead and zinc. Mining and heavy industry in the Ferghana Valley have contaminated the soil with toxic heavy metals. Gallery File:The only bridge out of Siafark, Tajikistan.jpgBridge from Siafark to the mine.

In July 2013, Holiday married United States women's national soccer team midfielder Lauren Cheney.Jrue Holiday Marries U.S. Women‚Äôs Soccer Star Lauren Cheney The two first met at a UCLA women's basketball game during his only season at the school. While he was approaching his seat, a young girl asked if he was Darren Collison and asked for his autograph. After explaining that he was not Collison and preparing to take his seat, Cheney, who was seated behind him, said, \\"Don't worry, you're cuter than Darren is.\\" At the time, both were in relationships with others, but they became friends, and began dating after he was drafted by the Sixers. They later began hosting annual combo basketball and soccer clinics at UCLA. In September 2016, Holiday took indefinite leave from the Pelicans to care for his wife after she was diagnosed with a brain tumor. The following month, Lauren had brain surgery only weeks after giving birth to the couple's daughter, Jrue Tyler Holiday. Holiday is a Christian. Holiday has said, ‚ÄúI'm a Christian athlete who has faith in Jesus Christ.

Left to right: Furrball, Elmyra Duff, Hamton J. Pig, Babs Bunny, Sweetie Pie, Buster Bunny, Plucky Duck, Montana Max, and Fifi La Fume. The Tiny Toon Adventures animated television series features an extensive cast of characters. The show's central characters are mostly various forms of anthropomorphic animals, based on Looney Tunes characters from earlier films and shows. In the series, the characters attend a school called Acme Looniversity, set in the cartoon community of Acme Acres.  Main characters   Buster Bunny  Buster Bunny (initially voiced by Charlie Adler and later by John Kassir) is a main character of the show along with Babs Bunny. Buster is a young, blue-and-white male rabbit with a red shirt and white gloves. Bugs Bunny is his mentor.Babs and Buster Bunny at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on March 19, 2016. In the last episode, It's a Wonderful Tiny Toon Christmas Special, Babs states that Buster is indeed her boyfriend. Adler voiced Buster in the cancelled video game Tiny Toon Adventures: Defenders of the Universe.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8067754 Buster is based on the Chuck Jones version of Bugs Bunny, who was the calm and collected foil to Jones' incarnation of Daffy Duck and attacked others only when provoked.  Babs Bunny  Babs Bunny (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is a main character of the show along with Buster Bunny. Babs dislikes being addressed by her full name, Barbara Anne Bunny. She is a young, female pink rabbit with a yellow shirt, violet skirt, and violet bows in her ears. She can change her attire by spinning around (a nod to Wonder Woman) and can also do impressions of celebrities and famous fictional characters including Mae West, Popeye, and Jessica Rabbit, and a few others. Babs is based on the Bob Clampett version of Bugs Bunny, who was a constant trickster that liked to disguise himself to fool others. Buster and Babs do not share a family relationship and neither do Bugs and Lola, as they occasionally point out when introducing themselves.  Plucky Duck  Plucky Duck (voiced by Joe Alaskey at his \\"normal\\" age and Nathan Ruegger as a baby) is a young, green male duck in a white tank top. Plucky is based on Daffy Duck's later incarnations (often seen in Chuck Jones' post-1948 shorts), which depict him as a greedier, more selfish, vainglorious coward and foil to Bugs Bunny's later incarnation (which is cooler, calmer, and more collected), compared to the earlier versions where Daffy was just a wacky, troublemaking duck. However, Plucky does have moments of heroism and goodwill and is more often than not shown to care about his friends and value their feelings. Plucky is friends with Hamton J. Pig and Buster Bunny (although he frequently annoys Buster, again much like Daffy does with Bugs). Plucky constantly pines for the love of Shirley McLoon though she has extremely little patience for him. Also like Daffy Duck, Plucky is capable of flying with his wings but very rarely does so.  Hamton J. Pig  Hamton J. Pig (voiced by Don Messick in the TV series, Billy West in video games)Hamton J. Pig at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on December 2, 2015. is a young, pink male pig with blue overalls. Based on Porky Pig, Hamton's role in the series is as a straight man, often against Plucky Duck's antics. The only difference is that Hamton never stutters unlike his mentor and uncle, Porky. Hamton is also shown as an overeater obsessed with cleanliness. Since Don Messick's death in 1997, Billy West took over the role of Hamton in a few video games, including 1998's Tiny Toon Adventures: Toonenstein.  Elmyra Duff  Elmyra Duff (voiced by Cree Summer)Elmyra Duff at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on June 17, 2016. is a redheaded girl. She wears a blue blouse, a white skirt, black Mary Janes over white socks and a blue bow with a skull at the center. Despite being based on Elmer Fudd (she has a similar face to Elmer, her red hair has been revealed to be a wig on several occasions, and her last name backwards is a misspelled take on \\"Fudd\\"), she is a total role reversal of him. Instead of hunting animals, she cares for them to selfish lengths and falls into the stereotype of the \\"spoiled and piercing-voiced girl.\\" She is one of the few human characters in the series, and like the animal characters, she attends Acme Looniversity where she also serves as the nurse. In two episodes, Elmyra's family is shown, including her mother, inventor father, typical '90s teen sister, younger brother, super-strong baby brother, and a maid. Elmyra is obsessed with having animals as pets, and will chase them or trap them in order to take them to her house. Despite everything, she is utterly oblivious to the abuse that she is inflicting on animals. She makes a few appearances in Animaniacs and starred along with Pinky and the Brain in a spin-off, Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain.  Montana Max  Montana Max (voiced by Danny Cooksey), nicknamed \\"Monty\\", is a young, brown-haired boy and the main antagonist. Based on Yosemite Sam (mostly in the fact that Max has an actual American location in his name, just like Sam does and is often an enemy to Buster Bunny, much like Sam is to Bugs Bunny), he is a bad-tempered, loud-mouthed, money-hungry tycoon. Like Elmyra, he is a human and attends Acme Looniversity. He is portrayed as a very wealthy character, living in a mansion and not having any friends, just a stubborn little boy. However, he does have a very rarely ever shown sweet side and has at least once been shown to have a good imagination. Elmyra likes Monty a lot, though he usually feels nothing but annoyance towards her. Monty is shown to be an only child and was the very first villain of the series, as seen in the pilot episode when the head of the studio rejected an artist's plans to have a cartoon star Monty.  Fifi La Fume  Fifi La Fume (voiced by Kath Soucie; Carmen Olarte in Latin America) is a young, purple and white female skunk with a pink bowed ribbon in her hair. Based on Pep√© Le Pew, she shares his character traits of having a French accent and aggressively seeking romance, only to find the object of her affection repulsed by her odor and aggressive amorous advances. However, unlike Pepe Le Pew, Fifi often takes being rejected to heart and cries over it (whereas Pepe just brushes off the rejection and continues the chase). Fifi often chases and unsuccessfully attempts to woo boys who have ended up with white stripes painted down their backs, such as Furrball the cat (though, unlike Pepe Le Pew, she doesn't mind if her objects of affection chase her). She lives in a striped 1959 Cadillac in a wreck yard.  Gogo Dodo  Gogo Dodo (voiced by Frank Welker) is a young, green male dodo with blue shoes, and a pink and purple umbrella sticking out from the top of his head. Gogo is noted for performing various bizarre sight gags or stunts. Unlike the other characters who attend Acme Looniversity, Gogo made his home in the Daliesque realm known as Wackyland, a surreal land where backgrounds changed constantly and the entrance to which was located across a bridge on the outskirts of the city of Acme Acres, the usual setting of Tiny Toon Adventures. According to series writer Paul Dini, Gogo is the only member of the Tiny Toons cast to be a direct relative of one of the Looney Tunes characters; he is the son of the original dodo from the 1938 cartoon Porky in Wackyland retroactively named Yoyo Dodo. Gogo's catchphrase is \\"It's been surreal!\\"  Shirley the Loon  Shirley \\"the Loon\\" McLoon (voiced by Gail Matthius) is a loon citizen of Acme Acres featured in Tiny Toon Adventures. Shirley is based on Daffy Duck's main love interest, Melissa Duck. She speaks with a thick valley girl accent (coincidentally, her voice actress, Gail Matthius, had a recurring character on Saturday Night Live and Laugh Trax who was a valley girl). Although she seems reasonably intelligent, is obsessed with superficial New Age paraphernalia. Her name is derived from fellow New Age aficionado Shirley MacLaine, while the latter part of the name is an obvious pun (she later appeared in an episode of Animaniacs standing next to MacLaine). More often than not, characters refer to Shirley as \\"Shirley the Loon\\" rather than \\"Shirley McLoon\\". She appears not to notice the negative connotations of the nickname, and, in fact, the mantra she recites while meditating is \\"Oh, what a loon I am. Oh, what a loon I am.\\" Shirley is often romantically pursued by Plucky Duck and Fowlmouth. Despite her annoyance with Plucky's flirtatious, Shirley does seem to care for him and date him on occasion. With Fowlmouth, there is no deep-seated affection for him. When not meditating or fortunetelling, Shirley hangs out with her Looniversity classmates Babs Bunny and Fifi La Fume. She also appears to be a skilled sorceress, as in one episode, she uses her powers to give Plucky the IQ of Einstein to help him ace a test. In \\"Love Disconnection\\", while attending a high school dance, Shirley gets doused with red punch, which triggers her psychokinetic powers and causes a flood at a school dance in a spoof of the Stephen King novel/movie Carrie. Shirley is a keen ballerina who has to face prejudice when attending an upmarket ballet school otherwise attended exclusively by Perfecto Prep swans. Jealous of her superior dance skills, they mock her accent and try to sabotage her performance at their recital, but are soon thwarted by Shirley's nimble moves and a behind-the-scenes Babs, who is staging a sabotage of her own.  Furrball  Furrball (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker; on the episodes \\"Cinemaniacs\\" and \\"Buster and the Wolverine\\", Rob Paulsen provides his voice) is a young, blue male cat with a hole on his right ear and a bandage on his tail. Furrball is usually depicted as living in a cardboard box in an alleyway, although other times he is shown as one of Elmyra's pets and briefly had a home with Mary Melody. He is often a quite peaceful and innocent character, but he is also one of the most unfortunate characters in the show, since he is almost always chased, abused or bullied, often by being squashed. For example, during the intro credits, he gets flattened by a falling upright piano to the lyric of \\"Furrball is unlucky\\" while sniffing a flower peacefully. He is less anthropomorphic in nature than the other animal characters, generally walking on all fours and almost always a mute, except for typical cat sounds. He is based on Penelope Pussycat and the Chuck Jones version of Sylvester the Cat, both of whom are silent.Andy Meisler, \\"Steven Spielberg Promises: 'Th-Th-That's Not All, Folks',\\" The New York Times (July 8, 1990) Furrball often chases Sweetie Pie, who is based on Tweety. In one speaking role (\\"Cinemaniacs\\"), he was voiced by Rob Paulsen in a mockup of Leonard McCoy from Star Trek. He also has another very brief speaking role in the episode \\"Buster and the Wolverine\\".  Dizzy Devil  Dizzy Devil (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) is a young and lavender male Tasmanian devil with a yellow propeller cap, as well as one pink eye and one green eye, and is also crosseyed. He is based on the Tasmanian Devil, and like him, he spins around in circles and eats constantly. Also like Taz, his speech is generally monosyllabic or composed of random noises. But unlike Taz, he has no ears, horns, or a tail. Dizzy is also adored and sometimes accompanied by a trio of young ladies, who often make the other guys, even Montana Max, go crazy. Dizzy meets them in an episode where Dizzy fell in love with a little tornado, thinking that is another Tasmanian Devil, but when the tornado leaves the city, Dizzy falls into depression and then the trio of young ladies got moved and decide to pet him.  Sweetie Pie  Sweetie Pie (voiced by Candi Milo) is a young, pink female canary with a light blue ribbon bow in her plumage. She is based on Tweety Bird; specifically, the Bob Clampett version that depicted Tweety as colored pink and more devious and active in dispatching his feline enemies, compared to the Friz Freleng version, where Tweety often relies on outside forces (such as Sylvester's constant failing, Granny, or Hector the bulldog) to protect him. Sweetie is regularly pursued by Furrball as Tweety is pursued by Sylvester. Sweetie, in turn, chases Bookworm (based on a nameless bookworm character that was featured in Chuck Jones' Sniffles the mouse cartoons) with about the same success as Furrball. In one of her appearances, she is shown to be cared for by an eagle, that at the beginning thought that she was also an eagle, only to find out that she was indeed too crazy and dangerous to take care of. In some instances, she switches from her babyish voice to a louder, more obnoxious voice.  Calamity Coyote  Calamity Coyote (voiced by Frank Welker) is a young, gray male coyote with pink high tops. He is based on Wile E. Coyote. Calamity never speaks, instead communicating through noises and through signs which he pulls out from behind his back. Calamity is also shown to be scientifically proficient, constructing random devices for the other characters. He also pursues Little Beeper unsuccessfully. Like Wile E., Calamity's devices also frequently malfunction, although not nearly as frequently as with his mentor, and some are actually successes whereas Wile E. has far fewer to his name. Calamity is also less antagonistic than Wile E., preferring to work on his various inventions rather than chase Little Beeper.  Little Beeper  Little Beeper (voiced by Frank Welker) is a young roadrunner with red and orange feathers and blue sneakers. Much like his Looney Tunes counterpart, the Road Runner, Beeper spends most of his time outrunning and dodging the efforts put into capturing him by Calamity Coyote. Unlike the Roadrunner, though, Beeper can laugh and make other sounds, but he does not speak.  Supporting characters   Li'l Sneezer  Li'l Sneezer (voiced by Kath Soucie), is based, by name, on the classic animated mouse Sniffles from the Looney Tunes shorts. However, his extremely talkative personality is based on Little Blabbermouse (hence his name being based on aspects of both characters). He is a young, gray male mouse who wears a diaper. He is shown to be allergic to many objects, even those to which no normal person would typically be allergic. His allergies trigger exaggerated, explosive, gale-forced sneezes capable of seriously damaging or destroying buildings, as Elmyra had the misfortune of finding out. He is the youngest of the students at Acme Looniversity, as he is the only one seen wearing diapers. Due to his small size, he is sometimes seen spending time with other smaller students like Sweetie.  Arnold the Pit Bull  Arnold the Pit Bull (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a white, muscular, and male pit bull with a pair of black sunglasses, parodying Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is one of the few characters who does not attend Acme Looniversity nor is based on an existing Warner Bros. character (though there is some connection between him and Hector the bulldog from the Sylvester and Tweety shorts). Arnold is shown as having various jobs, including lifeguard, doorman, zoo-keeper, security guard, bouncer, and gym owner. He hails from Romania, mentioned in the episode \\"It's Buster Bunny Time\\" and that he should move back there because it is safer, which explains his strong accent. His love interest is another white muscular pit bull named \\"Arnolda\\".  Byron Basset  Byron Basset (voiced by Frank Welker) is a brown, black and white male basset hound, generally portrayed as being slow and lazy. He is based on the Looney Tunes' many dog characters, specifically Sam the Sheepdog and, to a lesser extent, Barnyard Dawg. One sight gag involves him turning around: to do so, he pulls his head and tail inside the folds of his body, and out the other side. He is also shown to be capable of flight, seen in the movie Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation, using his stretchy skin to glide on a waft of air. Byron is sometimes shown to be one of Elmyra's pets as well. Byron's end tag is a simple \\"Woof!\\".  Fowlmouth  Fowlmouth (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a young, white male rooster with a blue, short-sleeved shirt. He is based on Foghorn Leghorn, though speaking in a New Yorker accent as opposed to a Southern United States accent. Fowlmouth is shown to be very polite when in his calm demeanor, but when his short temper is provoked, he launches into a bleeped-out swearing tirade. In his first appearance, he was even shown to pepper all of his sentences with profanity, but curbs this when children are around. Other appearances show him using euphemisms instead, likely due to Buster's efforts to train him out of swearing in his premiere episode. His general profane word used in all other appearances is \\"Dadgum\\".  Mary Melody  Mary Melody (voiced by Cindy McGee in her debut episode \\"Cross-Country Kitty\\", and Cree Summer in all other appearances) is a young, female, African-American human. Her name is a pun on the Merrie Melodies series of Warner Brothers shorts. She may be based on Granny, as she is the human master of Furrball, but is modeled after one-shot character So White from the controversial Warner Bros. short \\"Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs\\". As with the other human characters in the series, she attends Acme Looniversity. Melody sometimes hangs out with Babs, Shirley and Fifi. Mary has a sweet disposition with almost everybody and is also a bit more realistic about her surroundings than her human counterparts. She also prefers to blend into her surroundings and with her peers rather than kick them out like Montana Max or squeeze them to death like Elmyra Duff (also voiced by Cree Summer). Mary lives in an apartment building in the city of Acme Acres.  Bookworm  Bookworm is a green male worm with large glasses. He is based on the bookworm companion of Sniffles. He works at the Acme Looniversity library and is shown to be well-read, as well as proficient on the computer. In some scenes, he is pursued by Sweetie. Bookworm does not speak. He does, however, say something just before the football game in Buster Busts Loose on the SNES, though it is only onscreen text.  Concord Condor  Concord Condor (voiced by Rob Paulsen) is a young, purple male condor. He attends Acme Looniversity and lives in Acme Acres. He is based on Beaky Buzzard. Concord is shown to be shy and dimwitted, often ending sentences in \\"nope nope nope nope\\" or \\"yup yup yup yup\\". He lives at Acme Zoo, where he spends most of his time relaxing in his nest and watching TV.  Barky Marky  Barky Marky (voiced by Frank Welker) is a young, brown, and tan male dog. He is based on the Looney Tunes' many dog characters, specifically Marc Antony and Sam the Sheepdog. Barky Marky is portrayed as a typical canine who loves to play fetch as well as various other sports and activities. Even though Barky starred in his very own short entitled \\"Go Fetch\\" with Elmyra Duff, as well as making many cameo appearances on other episodes, appearing in the special Tiny Toon Adventures Spring Break Special and the movie Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation, Barky Marky was still referenced and mocked for his lack of appearances on the Saturday Night Live spoof Weekday Afternoon Live. When Buster Bunny is reading the news out loud from the viewers complaining about him not being in enough episodes, Babs Bunny, posing as a Tiny Toons casting director, asks \\"Who's Barky Marky?\\"  Looney Tunes characters   Acme Looniversity staff  The faculty of Acme Looniversity are classic Looney Tunes characters that some of the students are based on: * Bugs Bunny (voiced by Jeff Bergman in most episodes, Greg Burson in \\"Buster and Babs Go Hawaiian\\", \\"Best of Buster Day\\" and \\"It's a Wonderful Tiny Toons Christmas Special\\") ‚Äì Bugs Bunny is the Principal of Acme Looniversity, boyfriend of Lola Bunny and the mentor of Buster and Babs Bunny. * Daffy Duck (voiced by Jeff Bergman in most episodes, Joe Alaskey in \\"New Character Day\\", Greg Burson in \\"Two-Tone Town\\") ‚Äì Daffy Duck is a teacher at Acme Looniversity who serves as the mentor of Plucky Duck. * Elmer Fudd (voiced by Jeff Bergman in \\"Her Wacky Highness\\", \\"Psychic Fun-omenon Day\\", \\"Tiny Toon Music Television\\", \\"K-ACME TV\\" and \\"Viewer Mail Day\\", Greg Burson in \\"Journey to the Center of Acme Acres\\", \\"Wake Up Call of the Wild\\", \\"Fields of Honey\\", \\"Spring in Acme Acres\\", \\"Here's Hamton\\" and \\"Weekday Afternoon Live\\") ‚Äì Elmer Fudd is a teacher at Acme Looniversity who is the mentor of Elmyra Duff. * Foghorn Leghorn (voiced by Jeff Bergman in most episodes, Greg Burson in \\"Buster and Babs Go Hawaiian\\") ‚Äì Foghorn Leghorn is a teacher at Acme Looniversity and is the mentor of Fowlmouth (though this is rarely shown in the show). * Granny (voiced by June Foray) ‚Äì Granny serves as the Head School Nurse at Acme Looniversity.

Tyrone Turtle is seen in a few episodes such as \\"Hare Today, Gone Tomorrow\\", and \\"The Wide World of Elmyra\\".  Marcia the Martian  Marcia the Martian (voiced by Tress MacNeille) is the young female apprentice and niece of Marvin the Martian, and she only appears in \\"Duck Dodgers Jr.\\"  Roderick and Rhubella Rat  Roderick and Rhubella Rat (voiced by Charlie Adler and Tress MacNeille) are minor characters and students from Perfecto Prep, a rival school of Acme Looniversity. Roderick and Rhubella are rivals of Buster Bunny and Babs Bunny. They are said to be inspired by Disney characters Mickey and Minnie Mouse. They are portrayed as snooty, rich brats who believe they are above everyone else, but always get outdone and outsmarted by the bunny duo. Both Rubella Rat and Margot Mallard are two of the three quite unenthusiastic cheerleaders for Perfecto Prep.  Danforth Drake and Margot Mallard  Danforth Drake and Margot Mallard (voiced by Rob Paulsen and Kath Soucie), like Roderick and Rhubella Rat, are minor characters and students of Perfecto Prep. They are said to be inspired by Disney characters Donald and Daisy Duck. Danforth Drake and Roderick Rat are roommates, and both are members of Perfecto Prep's sports teams. Both Rubella Rat and Margot Mallard are two of the three quite unenthusiastic cheerleaders for Perfecto Prep.  Banjo Possum  Banjo Possum (voiced by Rob Paulsen), originally called \\"Woodpile Possum\\", is one of the minor characters on the show. He first appeared in the movie. He is a young, gray-and-white opossum with blue overalls, a brown-and- red hat, and a banjo. He lives in the swamps and backwoods with his kinfolk, who, unlike himself, tend to capture and prey on innocent travelers who wind up wandering into their territory. It is further confirmed in the \\"ACME Cable TV\\" episode that Banjo's family members are inbred and carnivorous. He silently bonds with Buster over the way he can play his banjo in a similar way to how he (Buster) can play his own face, and through this friendship, he later rescues him, Babs, and Byron from a mob of predators (that includes some members of his own family, the alligator daughters who want to marry Buster, and their father) pursuing them late in the movie. Because of his friendship with them, he ultimately decides to enroll at Acme Looniversity at the end of the movie to get some \\"edumacation\\" and spend more time with them. Since his debut, he makes other appearances, both speaking and voiceless. Banjo is roughly based on the character Lonnie from the movie Deliverance.  Witch Sandy  Witch Sandy (voiced by Sally Struthers) is a witch based on Witch Hazel, and had a one-time appearance on the show in a parody of Hansel and Gretel. She lived in a house made out of carrot cake and drew the attention of Buster and Babs. She tried to use the two in a recipe like Hazel, turning Babs into a non-anthropomorphic white rabbit and summoning her cutlery to try and kill Buster, but she got turned into a goldfish. Sandy wears a cute disguise, but she is actually as hideous-looking as Hazel.  Saul Sheepdog  Saul Sheepdog is a blueish green sheepdog puppy based on Sam Sheepdog. He is a silent character. He makes cameo appearances in a few episodes such as \\"The Acme Bowl\\" and the short Duck Trek (a parody of Star Trek) from the episode \\"Cinemaniacs\\".  Chewcudda  Chewcudda (voiced by Frank Welker) is a bull and a minor character on the show. He only appeared in one episode, \\"A Quack in the Quarks\\", a parody of Star Wars Episode IV ‚Äì A New Hope. Chewcudda was a parody of Chewbacca, except he is a bull and not a wookiee like Chewbacca. He is based on the Looney Tunes character Toro the bull from Bully for Bugs. Chewcudda goes along for the ride with Plucky and Frank and Ollie (two young alien ducklings who came to Earth seeking a savior, but instead found Plucky), as they set off to try and take down Duck Vader (a parody of Darth Vader) and his versions of the stormtroopers (with armor shaped in the form of a duck)). Plucky mistakes him for a bean bag at first and sits on him, but Chewcudda reveals himself and yells at Plucky. Plucky sticks out his tongue at the large bull, and this makes Chewcudda furious. He charges into him. Chewcudda charges into anything (or anyone) when he sees the color red, as Ollie states, \\"It's the bull in him.\\" Later, he is captured by the stormtroopers and his feet are tied up together by rope. He chews on grass (hence the pun \\"Chew\\" in his name) and spits it at a couple of the stormtroopers, knocking them over. When Frank throws a bottle of ketchup at Duck Vader, it busts and covers him in it, causing Chewcudda to break free from his rope and charge into Vader, sending him across the room and knocking him unconscious.  The Wackyland Rubber Band  The Wackyland Rubber Band is what the name implies, a band of animorphic rubber bands that are residents of Wackyland. Capable of shaping themselves into various instruments from drums to horns, this lively quartet can play almost anything and is usually featured in large or important events, such as the halftime show of the football game in \\"The Acme Bowl\\" or the source of the music at the junior prom in \\"Prom-ise Her Anything\\". They first appeared in the Looney Tunes series in Porky in Wackyland (1938) and its color remake Dough for the Do-Do (1949). They also appeared Tin Pan Alley Cats (1943).  Lightning Rodriguez  Lightning Rodriguez is a rejected mouse character based on Speedy Gonzales. According to creator Tom Ruegger, Rodriguez was conceived as a Latino character with speed as his main trait. But the staff of the show decided they already had a fast character in Little Beeper, so the character would be superfluous. Creating a younger version of Speedy was not a high priority. The Speedy Gonzalez series were already attracting criticism for their characters' ethnicity, and it was feared Rodriguez would be seen as an ethnic stereotype. Despite this, Rodriguez actually made two appearances on the show; one was in \\"The Acme Bowl\\", where he is seen singing with the other 'Tiny Toons' around a campfire at night before playing against Perfecto Prep. His other appearance is in the episode \\"You Asked for It\\", where Plucky displays a machine that shows which character the fans want to see (Rodriguez is one of the characters that passes by on the machine's screen).  Lady May  Lady May (voiced by Kath Soucie) is a pink female pig based on Petunia Pig. She only appeared at the beginning of \\"Buster and Babs Go Hawaiian\\", where Hamton stars in his own segment \\"Fleche de Lard\\" (meaning \\"arrow the lard\\"). When they are about to kiss, Buster and Babs interrupt the segment. Lady May ends up kissing Plucky. In the segment itself, villainous Lord Sebastian (a wild boar) tells Lady May (the damsel in distress) that he plans to take her as his wife. Then \\"Sir Hamton the Prudent\\" comes to the rescue, challenging the villain to a sword duel. Hamton calls for Plucky as Knave Pluck to give him his sword. He battles Lord Sebastian, defeats him, and chases him away. Hamton thus saves Lady May. She and Hamton are about to kiss, only to be interrupted by Buster and Babs, who complain about not being in the cartoon. She is last seen in the background, kissing Plucky while Hamton tells them that this cartoon was his vehicle to stardom.  Egghead Jr.  Egghead Jr. is a one-shot character who greatly resembles Elmer Fudd (who himself had evolved from an earlier character named Egghead). In \\"Plucky's Dastardly Deed\\", he is \\"the smartest kid in class\\", whom Plucky aims to swap tests with. Egghead Jr. is based on the obscure Looney Tunes character Egghead. The former's head is a bit larger and his nose is smaller. The latter was never officially seen on Tiny Toon Adventures. Egghead Jr. also appears in \\"Hog Wild Hamton\\", but this time is redrawn as the actual Egghead Jr., a genius baby chick from the Foghorn Leghorn series.  Julie Bruin  Julie Bruin (voiced by Julie Brown) is an attractive anthropomorphic female bear and a caricature/parody of her voice actress Julie Brown, who appears in the episode \\"Tiny Toon Music Television\\" in a segment called Just Say Julie Bruin which is a parody of Brown's MTV Music Video show Just Say Julie. She first appears after the opening credits of her sketch, where she is laying down what seems to be a version of Twister. She then tells the viewers that she's having a 1960s-style tango party with Buster and Babs, who said they invited Madonna to her party. When Buster and Babs arrive, they seem to be alone. Buster and Babs tell her that they did not say Madonna but Fuddonna (Elmer Fudd in drag). Julie puts on a music video starring Montana Max singing, \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\". She later makes a non-speaking appearance in the same music video on Monty's cruise ship, where he tosses her into the ocean. He throws a lifesaver for her to float on, but she gets hit in the head with it instead.  Other antagonists   Gotcha Grabmore  Gotcha Grabmore (voiced by Joan Gerber) is an evil businesswoman who kills wild animals to make cosmetics. She only makes two appearances in \\"Raining Daze\\" where she tries to kill a seal. She later returned in \\"Whale's Tales\\" where she tries to kill some whales. Gotcha first appears in the segment \\"Fur- Gone Conclusion\\" as the main antagonist. When Buster and Babs take a wrong turn on their way to Aruba and end up in Antarctica, Babs gets frozen in a block of ice and is defrosted by a baby seal. Gotcha captures the baby seal and attempts to skin it, so Babs and Buster disguise themselves as the Vanderbunnys in an attempt to save it. Gotcha returns in the episode, \\"Whale's Tales\\", again as the main antagonist. She builds a new cosmetics factory and teams up with a crew of octopi pirates, led by Octavius. Together, they capture a mother whale, leaving her baby in the hands of Elmyra Duff. Buster and Babs rescue the baby whale and he takes them to Gotcha's factory. Gotcha plans to kill the mother whale to use her blubber for her cosmetics. She even threatens to kill the baby, to \\"make baby oil.\\" Gotcha makes a cameo appearance in the \\"A Cat's Eye View\\" episode segment \\"Party Crasher Plucky\\", where she is one of the celebrities seen attending Shirley MacLaine's party.  Dr. Gene Splicer  Dr. Gene Splicer is a mad scientist.  Sappy Stanley  Sappy Stanley (voiced by Jonathan Winters) is a green elephant and very jealous of Bugs Bunny. He has made only one appearance, in \\"Who Bopped Bugs Bunny?\\", which is a parody of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?. Sappy Stanley is a parody of Terrytoons character Sidney the Elephant a.k.a. Silly Sidney. Sidney was created by Gene Deitch.Lenburg (2006), p. 23 As a baby, Stanley discovered he had the ability to make others laugh, when chimpanzees threw coconuts at his head and laughed at him. Throughout the 1950s, Stanley starred in many classic cartoons. His best cartoon was \\"Which Way to the Arctic?\\", which involved him getting hit by coconut-throwing chimpanzees. The film was nominated for the Hollywood Shloscar (a parody of the Oscars), but lost to Knighty Knight Bugs (1958). Outraged, Stanley moved to Paris, where he became a national star, but slowly began building up his revenge against Bugs Bunny. The historical background to the episode was the nomination of Silly Sidney's second short, called \\"Sidney's Family Tree\\" (1958), for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. It lost to Knighty Knight Bugs.Lenburg (2006), p. 23  The Wolverine  The Wolverine who tries to eat the Tiny Toons.  The Coyote Kid  The Coyote Kid (voiced by Frank Welker) is a brown coyote who is an outlaw and is the main antagonist of \\"High Toon\\". He bears a close resemblance to Wile E. Coyote, but is not to be confused with him.

Set in medieval Japan, the novel tells the story of Takiko, the 11-year-old daughter of a slain samurai warrior. Takiko‚Äôs mother remarries Goro, a gentle but unattractive potter/dwarf, whom Takiko fears. When she matures into adulthood, Takiko is able to find employment in the court of the Japanese emperor and falls in love with an enemy spy-Hideo. Eventually, she returns home and is able to reconcile her feelings towards Goro.‚ÄúKatherine Paterson‚Äù by Alice B. McGinty, Google Books Of Nightingales That Weep won the 1994 Phoenix Award from the Children's Literature Association as the best English-language children's book that did not win a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. The award is named after the mythical bird phoenix, which is reborn from its ashes, to suggest the book's rise from obscurity.\\"Phoenix Award Brochure 2012\\". Children's Literature Association. Retrieved 11 December 2012. (See also the current homepage \\"Phoenix Award\\" .) Summary Set during the Genpei War, the two rival Japanese clans, the Genji and Heike, are constantly battling for the support of the Senior Cloistered Emperor and the power to rule Japan. Takiko is a beautiful girl who can talentedly play the koto, a thirteen-stringed instrument. She is only eleven years old when her samurai father nobly dies in a battle for the Heike cause. Soon after, her mother remarries a disfigured country potter named Goro. Goro is neither Genji nor Heike, and although he is physically contorted, he has a kind spirit. At first, Takiko doesn‚Äôt like Goro because of what he looks like on the outside. However, Takiko learns to see further inside Goro's true character, and begins to respect him. However, her newfound trust is tested when her mother gives birth to a son. After over a year in the country with the little boy, a merchant visits Goro‚Äôs farm and takes Takiko to the capital as a lady-in- waiting to the princess. With her elevated status, she is now more respected. When visiting a temple under the princess‚Äô vague orders, she falls in love with a Genji spy named Hideo. Because of her beauty and talented koto playing, the princess sends Takiko to the young Heike Emperor Antoku to support him through hard times with her music and mental encouragement. Soon, several members of the Heike royal family, including Takiko, are sent into exile to escape the power-hungry Genji who are threatening to attack the city. They bring with them the Imperial Regalia, a set of objects necessary to crown a new emperor. This way, they can ensure that the Genji will not crown a new Genji emperor, and the Heike can still stay in command of Japan. All the members of the Heike party are exiled to an island because the Genji do not yet have a strong sea fleet to reach them and attack them. After a few months, the Genji make their first attack on the mountainside of the mainland. The Heike are prepared with soldiers, but they are forced to retreat. The members of the Heike royal court are rushed back to their island. After a few months, Takiko finds Hideo spying in the manor garden. After talking, Takiko lets Hideo go because of her love for him. Soon after, when praying in a temple, Takiko discovers Hideo‚Äôs secret hideout. After talking for a while, Takiko goes back to the manor of her exile. Soon, the Genji make their first attack from the sea. They bring a small fleet, and a few hundred skilled soldiers. They then set fire to the area surrounding the manor. The Heike are petrified as they board warships and begin fighting. After losing confidence, the Heike retreat. Soon, the lead Heike general comes up with a plan to destroy the Genji. However, his plan fails, and the Heike are captured. Several members of the Heike nobility, including the Emperor, jump overboard before being captured to avoid humiliation. After Takiko escapes with Hideo‚Äôs help, she returns to Goro. She finds out that when she was gone, her mother and brother died of sickness. Takiko starts to work in the fields and loses much of her beauty because of her filthy feet, her frostbitten hands, and her brittle hair. Worst of all, she has a huge burn on her face because of an accident with Goro. Her callused hands prevent her from playing the koto as beautifully as she did before.

Caribbean poetry generally refers to a myriad of poetic forms, spanning epic, lyrical verse, prose poems, dramatic poetry and oral poetry, composed in Caribbean territories regardless of language. It is most often, however, written in English, Spanish, Spanglish, French, Hindustani, Dutch, or any number of creoles. Poetry in English from the former British West Indies have be referred to as Anglo- Caribbean poetry or West Indian poetry. Since the mid-1970s, Caribbean poetry has gained increasing visibility with the publication in Britain and North America of several anthologies.Edward Baugh, \\"A History of Poetry\\", in Albert James Arnold, Julio Rodr√≠guez-Luis, J. Michael Dash (eds), A History of Literature in the Caribbean, Vol 2: English- and Dutch-speaking countries, Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1994, pp. 227-282. Over the decades the canon has shifted and expanded, drawing both on oral and literary traditions and including more women poets and politically charged works.Emilio Jorge Rodr√≠guez, \\"Oral Tradition and New Literary Canon in Caribbean Poetry\\", in Albert James Arnold, Julio Rodr√≠guez-Luis, J. Michael Dash (eds), A History of Literature in the Caribbean, Volume 3: Cross-Cultural Studies, Amsterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins Publishing Co., 1994, pp. 177-185.Arturo Cattaneo, \\"Caribbean Verse: History of Literature As History in Literature\\".Christian Andrew Campbell, Romancing \\"the Folk\\": Rereading the Nation in Caribbean Poetics, Duke University dissertation, 2007. Caribbean writers, performance poets, newspaper poets, singer-songwriters have created a popular art form, a poetry heard by audiences all over the world. Caribbean oral poetry shares the vigour of the written tradition. Among the most prominent Caribbean poets whose works are widely studied (and translated into other languages) are: Derek Walcott (who won the 1992 Nobel Prize for Literature), Kamau Brathwaite, Edouard Glissant, Giannina Braschi, Lorna Goodinson,Aim√© Fernand C√©saire, Linton Kwesi Johnson,Maya Jaggi, \\"Profile: Linton Kwesi Johnson - Poet on the front line\\", The Guardian, 4 May 2002. Kwame Dawes, and Claudia Rankine. Common themes include: exile and return to the motherland; the relationship of language to nation; colonialism and postcolonialism; self-determination and liberty; racial identity.  Caribbean Epic Poetry  Derek Walcott's Omeros (1990) is one of the most renown epic poems of the 20th century and of the Caribbean. The work is divided into seven books containing sixty-four chapters. Most of the poem is composed in a three- line form that is reminiscent of the terza rima form that Dante used for The Divine Comedy. The work, referencing Homer and other characters from the Iliad, refers to Greek, Roman, and American slavery. The narrative arch of the epic takes place on the island of St. Lucia, where Walcott was born and raised, but includes imaginings of ancient Greece and Rome, as well as travels to modern day Lisbon, London, Dublin, Toronto. Giannina Braschi's Empire of Dreams (1988) is a postmodern Caribbean epic composed of six books of poetry that blend elements of eclogues, epigrams, lyrics, prose poem, and manifesto. Braschi's United States of Banana (2011) is a geopolitical tragic-comedy about the fall of the American empire, the liberation of Puerto Rico, and the unification of the Caribbean isles. Blending elements of poetry, lyrical essay, and dramatic dialogues, this postmodern epic tackles the subjects of global debt, labor abuse, and environmental crises on the rise. Anthony Kellman created the Caribbean poetic form Tuk Verse, which incorporates melodic and rhythmic elements of Barbadian indigenous folk music called Tuk. His 2008 book Limestone: An Epic Poem of Barbados is the first published epic poem of Barbados.\\"Anthony Kellman\\" , Authors, Peepal Tree Press.

Its mission is to \\"transform healthcare in South Sudan.\\" Currently, the organization‚Äôs primary focus is on funding and overseeing the Duk Lost Boys Clinic. The Duk Lost Boys Clinic specializes in the treatment of diseases such as guinea worm disease, malaria, chicken pox, diarrhea, malnourishment, bilharzias, h-worm, kalazar; the immunization of other diseases; and the provision of maternity services. The Foundation is headquartered in Syracuse, New York. John Dau John Dau also known as Dhieu Deng Leek is the founder and president of the John Dau Foundation. Dau is a survivor of the civil war in South Sudan and part of the exodus of the Lost Boys of Sudan who were forced to flee their families and homeland. Dau was featured in the award- winning documentary God Grew Tired of Us in 2006 which won the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival.  Governance  The John Dau Foundation is governed by a ten-member Board of Directors that is headed by Bill Coplin, Director of the Public Affairs Department at Syracuse University. The organization‚Äôs Board of Advisors is made up of 15 members and includes Lopez Lomong, the Sudanese-born track and field athlete who carried the U.S. flag in the Opening Ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics. He announced his support for JDF in September 2008 and shortly thereafter became a member of the organization‚Äôs Board of Advisors.

Lee (Public Relations Advisor) * Marcio Malogolowkin (International Health Advisor) * Paul Murray (Fundraising Advisor) * Ginny Stehle (Operations Advisor) * Jim Vedder (Operations Advisor) * Chuck Williams (Operations Advisor)  Ties to the government of South Sudan  John Dau has strong ties to local governmental officials in South Sudan. His uncle, Philip Thon Leek, who was a governor of the State of Jongeli and is now a Minister of Transport in the Government of National Unity, has been instrumental in providing contacts and support from the natives, Tribal Chiefs and the Sudanese Peoples Liberation Movements and its Health Ministry. The Foundation has received a commitment from the local government to provide support by the end of 2009 for the existing clinic. Although there is no guarantee that this will happen due to the government of South Sudan's financial constraint, it represents a viable strategy that will require less outside support to sustain what has been developed.  American Care for Sudan Foundation  In June 2008, the American Care for Sudan Foundation (ACSF) announced that it would merge with JDF as its operational wing. ACSF was formed initially under the leadership of John Dau and the dedication and hard work of a group of members of the First Presbyterian Church of Skaneateles to build the Duk Lost Boys Clinic in Duk Payuel, South Sudan in early 2007.  Notable contributions  Notable contributions to the Duk Lost Boys Clinic and John Dau Foundation include $100,000 donated by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie (the Jolie-Pitt Foundation) in 2006; $50,000 by the Allyn Family of Welch Allyn in 2006; $25,000 by Volvo in 2008; and $100,000 by United Technologies Corporation in 2008.

Its common names include rosinweed, whole-leaf rosinweed, entire- leaf rosinweed, and prairie rosinweed.Silphium integrifolium. NatureServe. 2012. It is native to eastern North America, including Ontario in Canada and the eastern and central United States as far west as New Mexico.  Description  This species is a perennial herb growing from a fibrous root system and producing stems up to tall. It can form a large clump of up to 100 stems. The stems are hairless to slightly rough-haired, and sometimes waxy in texture. The leaves are stemless and oppositely arranged on the stems. The basal leaves are lost by maturity. The leaf blades are lance-shaped to ovate, smooth-edged or toothed, hairless to rough-haired, and up to about long. The inflorescence holds one to 15 flower heads. The head is lined with 2 or 3 rows of phyllaries which are hairless or rough and sometimes glandular, and have rounded bases and pointed tips. The head has up to 36 yellow ray florets and many yellow disc florets. The fruit has a short pappus. There are two varieties of the species: *S. integifolium var. integrifolium ‚Äì in height *S. integifolium var. laeve ‚Äì generally tall, with more florets and hairless leaves  Ecology  The foliage of the plant is eaten by herbivores such as the white-tailed deer and the blister beetle Epicauta fabricius. Plants have also been noted to lose approximately 17% of their fruits to lepidopteran larvae. The most common herbivorous insect on this species is the gall wasp Antistrophus silphii. The wasp injects its eggs into the apical meristem of the plant, and as its larvae develop, a spherical gall up to wide forms in the meristem. This stops the shoot from growing. Up to 30 larvae overwinter in each gall, pupate, and emerge as adult wasps the following season.  Uses  The plant had uses among Native American peoples. The Meskwaki, for example, used the roots to treat pain from injuries. This species is cultivated for use in gardens. Compared to other Silphium species, it is shorter, less likely to topple over, and faster from seed to flower. While it looks similar to sunflowers (Helianthus), it is more manageable than most perennial sunflowers because it spreads more slowly, and it is not known to be allelopathic. Researchers at the Land Institute, with a number of collaborating institutions, have initiated a project to domesticate this species for use as an oilseed crop.

The Wolfpack name and brand was used for two teams: an indoor football team in the Continental Indoor Football League and a traditional (outdoor) football team in the Mid Continental Football League. The indoor team played its home games at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Madison, Wisconsin in its inaugural season of 2009, but moved to the Hartmeyer Arena for the 2010 season. The outdoor team was somewhat nomadic throughout its history with regards to where it played its home games, however, outdoor games were generally played in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. Indoor history Prior to the Wolfpack franchise's 2008 outdoor campaign, the Milwaukee Bonecrushers of the Continental Indoor Football League approached the Wolfpack coaches and staff and asked them to assist with the completion of their 2008 season following Gilbert Brown's decision to resign as head coach and the resulting resignation of most of the Bonecrushers' staff. Kopac assumed the role of general manager for the Bonecrushers, and brought with him the core coaches of the Wolfpack outdoor team that would later become the core of the Wolfpack indoor team. Kopac led the team to its only win, a 51-46 victory of the Muskegon Thunder. With infrastructure already in place from the outdoor team, and following the previous year's experience with the Bonecrushers, Wolfpack management announced in early 2009 it would field both indoor and outdoor teams that year. To start the indoor team, Kopac coordinated with Lowe Entertainment, owners of the Rock River Raptors, also in the CIFL, to have Lowe run the indoor franchise while retaining Kopac as head coach. The Wolfpack were Madison's second indoor football franchise and the first to call Madison home since the Madison Mad Dogs folded in 2001. The Wolfpack played its inaugural season's home games at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum on the campus of the Alliant Energy Center and used AstroTurf previously belonging to the Pensacola Barracudas of AF2. In its inaugural season, the team finished 7-5 and qualified for the CIFL Playoffs, The team started 5-1 but struggled late in the season after former All-American UW-Platteville quarterback Tom Stetzer was lost to injury. The Wolfpack would fall to the eventual undefeated CIFL champion Chicago Slaughter in the 2009 CIFL Western Conference Championship Game, 63-19. For 2010, the Wolfpack chose to move its home games to the Hartmeyer Arena on the northeast side of Madison. 2010 also saw the team stock its roster with more players from the nearby Wisconsin Badgers football program. Joining defensive lineman Kurt Ware and linebacker James Kamoku from the 2009 Wolfpack would be tight end Andy Crooks, safety Josh Nettles, defensive lineman Ricky Garner, offensive lineman Kenny Jones and, following a season-ending injury to quarterback Brian Ryczkowski, Matt Schabert. Under Schabert's guidance, the Wolfpack had its most successful season to date, indoor or outdoor, finishing the regular season 8-2 and becoming the only team to defeat the then-undefeated Cincinnati Commandos. The Wolfpack would win its first-ever home playoff game, beating the Fort Wayne FireHawks, 25-24, before falling to the Commandos in the 2010 CIFL Championship Game, 54-40, in Cincinnati.

They are in the Central Division of Major League Baseball's American League. Since 1994, they have played in Progressive Field. The Cleveland team originated in 1900 as the Lake Shores, when the American League (AL) was officially a minor league. One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the major league incarnation of the club was founded in Cleveland in 1901. 1894‚Äì1946: Beginning to middle The Grand Rapids Rustlers was founded in Michigan in 1894 and were in the Western League. In 1900 the team moved to Cleveland and was named The Cleveland Lake Shores. Around the same time Ban Johnson changed the name of his minor league Western League to the American League. In 1900 the American League was still considered a minor league. In 1901 Cleveland renamed itself the \\"Bluebirds\\" when the American League broke with the National Agreement and declared itself a competing Major League. The Cleveland franchise was among its eight charter members. 1909 Cleveland Naps The new team was owned by coal magnate Charles Somers and tailor Jack Kilfoyl. Somers, a wealthy industrialist and also co-owner of the Boston Americans, lent money to other team owners, including Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, to keep them and the new league afloat. Players didn't think the name \\"Bluebirds\\" was suitable for a baseball team. Writers frequently shortened it to \\"Blues\\" due to the players' all-blue uniforms, but the players didn't like this name either. The players themselves tried to change the name to \\"Broncos\\" in , but it never really caught on. The Bluebirds suffered from financial problems in their first two seasons. This led Somers to seriously consider moving to either Pittsburgh or Cincinnati. Relief came in 1902 as a result of the conflict between the National and American Leagues. In 1901, Napoleon \\"Nap\\" Lajoie, the Philadelphia Phillies' star second baseman, jumped to the A's after his contract was capped at $2,400 per year‚Äîone of the highest-profile players to jump to the upstart AL. The Phillies subsequently filed an injunction to force Lajoie's return, which was granted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The injunction appeared to doom any hopes of an early settlement between the warring leagues. However, a lawyer discovered that the injunction was only enforceable in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Mack, partly to thank Somers for his past financial support, agreed to trade Lajoie to the then-moribund Blues, who offered $25,000 salary over three years. Due to the injunction, however, Lajoie had to sit out any games played against the A's in Philadelphia. Lajoie arrived in Cleveland on June 4 and was an immediate hit, drawing 10,000 fans to League Park. Soon afterward, he was named team captain, and the team was renamed the \\"Naps\\" after a newspaper conducted a write-in contest. Lajoie was named manager in , and the team's fortunes improved somewhat. They finished half a game short of the pennant in 1908. However, the success did not last and Lajoie resigned during the 1909 season as manager but remained on as a player. triples in a season and career batting average. After that, the team began to unravel, leading Kilfoyl to sell his share of the team to Somers. Cy Young, who returned to Cleveland in 1909, was ineffective for most of his three remaining years and Addie Joss died from tubercular meningitis prior to the season. Nap Lajoie 1913Despite a strong lineup anchored by the potent Lajoie and Shoeless Joe Jackson, poor pitching kept the team below third place for most of the next decade. One reporter referred to the team as the Napkins, \\"because they fold up so easily\\". The team hit bottom in 1914 and 1915, finishing in the cellar both years. 1915 brought significant changes to the team. Lajoie, nearly 40 years old, was no longer a top hitter in the league, batting only .258 in 1914. With Lajoie engaged in a feud with manager Joe Birmingham, the team sold Lajoie back to the A's. With Lajoie gone, the club needed a new name. Somers asked the local baseball writers to come up with a new name, and based on their input, the team was renamed the Cleveland Indians.\\"Baseball writes select 'Indians' as the best name to apply to the former Naps\\" The Plain Dealer January 17, 1915: 15 It is claimed that the nickname \\"Indians\\" references Cleveland Spiders baseball club during the time when Louis Sockalexis, a Native American, had played in Cleveland (1897‚Äì99);\\"Looking Backwards\\" The Plain Dealer January 18, 1915: 8 however this is contested by sportswriter Joe Posnanski who argues \\"Why exactly would people in Cleveland ‚Äî this in a time when Native Americans were generally viewed as subhuman in America ‚Äî name their team after a relatively minor and certainly troubled outfielder?\\" Sockalexis played only 96 games over three seasons, compiling just 367 at bats in his career. Sockalexis also \\"had to deal with horrendous racism, terrible taunts, whoops from the crowd, and so on,\\" according to Posnanski. According to history professor Jonathan Zimmerman, the franchise was named the Indians by local baseball writers not to honor Sockalexis, but as a reference to the \\"fun\\" that he would inspire in crowds and the fact that journalists jokingly referred to the club as the \\"Cleveland Indians,\\" even though it was officially named the Spiders.http://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/the-curse-of-chief- wahoo/Content?oid=2954423&showFullText;=true \\"In place of the Naps, we'll have the Indians, on the warpath all the time, and eager for scalps to dangle at their belts,\\" wrote an article in the Cleveland Leader of January 17, 1915. At the same time as the team was renamed, Somers' business ventures began to fail, leaving him deeply in debt. With the Indians playing poorly, attendance and revenue suffered. Somers decided to trade Jackson midway through the 1915 season for two players and $31,500, one of the largest sums paid for a player at the time. 1916 to 1926: Ownership Change and First World Series Title By , Somers was at the end of his tether, and sold the team to a syndicate headed by Chicago railroad contractor James C. \\"Jack\\" Dunn. Manager Lee Fohl, who had taken over in early 1915, acquired two minor league pitchers, Stan Coveleski and Jim Bagby and traded for center fielder Tris Speaker, who was engaged in a salary dispute with the Red Sox. All three would ultimately become key players in bringing a championship to Cleveland. Speaker took over the reins as player-manager in , and would lead the team to a championship in 1920. On August 16, the Indians were playing the Yankees at the Polo Grounds in New York. Shortstop Ray Chapman, who often crowded the plate, was batting against Carl Mays, who had an unusual underhand delivery. It was also late in the afternoon and the infield would have been in shadow with the center field area (the batters' background) bathed in sunlight. As well, at the time, \\"part of every pitcher's job was to dirty up a new ball the moment it was thrown onto the field. By turns, they smeared it with dirt, licorice, tobacco juice; it was deliberately scuffed, sandpapered, scarred, cut, even spiked. The result was a misshapen, earth-colored ball that traveled through the air erratically, tended to soften in the later innings, and as it came over the plate, was very hard to see.\\" In any case, Chapman did not move reflexively when Mays' pitch came his way. The pitch hit Chapman in the head, fracturing his skull. Chapman died the next day, becoming the only player to sustain a fatal injury from a pitched ball.Report of Chapman's Death, New York Times, 8/18/1920 The Indians, who at the time were locked in a tight three-way pennant race with the Yankees and White Sox, were not slowed down by the death of their teammate. Rookie Joe Sewell hit .329 after replacing Chapman in the lineup. Game 5 of the 1920 World Series at League Park, with Bill Wambsganss tagging out Otto Miller for the final out of Wambsganss' historic unassisted triple playIn September 1920, the Black Sox Scandal came to a boil. With just a few games left in the season, and Cleveland and Chicago neck-and-neck for first place at 94‚Äì54 and 95‚Äì56 respectively, the Chicago owner suspended eight players. The White Sox lost 2 of 3 in their final series, while Cleveland won 4 and lost 2 in their final two series. Cleveland finished 2 games ahead of Chicago and 3 games ahead of the Yankees to win its first pennant, led by Speaker's .388 hitting, Jim Bagby's 30 victories, and solid performances from Steve O'Neill and Stan Coveleski. Cleveland went on to defeat the Brooklyn Robins 5‚Äì2 in the World Series for their first title, winning four games in a row after the Robins took a 2‚Äì1 Series lead. The Series included three memorable \\"firsts\\", all of them in Game 5 at Cleveland, and all by the home team. In the first inning, right fielder Elmer Smith hit the first Series grand slam. In the fourth inning, Jim Bagby hit the first Series home run by a pitcher. And in the top of the fifth inning, second baseman Bill Wambsganss executed the first (and only, so far) unassisted triple play in World Series history, in fact the only Series triple play of any kind. The team would not reach the heights of 1920 again for 28 years. Speaker and Coveleski were aging and the Yankees were rising with a new weapon: Babe Ruth and the home run. They managed two second-place finishes but spent much of the decade in the cellar. In winter of 1922, Dunn contracted influenza, which lingered for months, and eventually died at his home in Chicago on June 9. Accordingly, control of the team passed to his widow, Edith Dunn, and his estate; making Mrs. Dunn among the first women to own a major league baseball team. Lewis, op cit, p. 140 However, Mrs. Dunn had no interest in running the team, leaving the decision-making to Ernest Barnard, who served as general manager since 1903. 1927 to 1946: The Bradley Years to WWII In 1927, Edith, by then known as Mrs. George Pross, sold the team to a syndicate headed by Alva Bradley for $1 million. The Bradley group brought stability to a team that had a caretaker (Barnard) running it for five years. Bradley was a well- established businessman from a prominent Cleveland family, was president of the Cleveland Chamber of Commerce, the chairman of the Cleveland Builders Supply Company, and an avid baseball fan. Other members of the ownership group included his brother, Charles Bradley, with whom he invested $175,000, banker John Sherwin Sr. ($300,000), Percy Morgan ($200,000), former Cleveland mayor and U.S. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker ($25,000), along with this law partner attorney Joseph C. Hostetler ($25,000; and would later be legal counsel for the American League), and the railroad magnates Van Sweringen brothers ($250,000). While Bradley was the team's president, he was not the majority shareholder. The Indians were a middling team by the 1930s, finishing third or fourth most years. However, ownership began to wobble during the Great Depression. The Van Swearingens, or the \\"Vans\\" as they were commonly known, ran into incredible financial difficulty and were forced to liquidate assets to cover loans. In 1932, the Vans sold their original $250,000 investment (which was 25% of the team) for $125,000 to Alva Bradley, E.G. Crawford, I.F. Freiberger, and W.G. Bernet. Morgan also sold his original $200,000 investment (which was 20% of the team) to George Martin and George Tomlinson for an undisclosed sum. The Vans died essentially penniless in 1934 and 1936. brought Cleveland a 17-year-old pitcher, Bob Feller, who came from Van Meter, Iowa, with a powerful fastball. That season, Feller set a record with 17 strikeouts in a single game and went on to lead the league in strikeouts from 1938‚Äì1941. After the 1937 season, Secretary Baker also died. Indians catchers Hank Helf and Frank Pytlak set the \\"all-time altitude mark\\" on August 20, 1938, by catching baseballs dropped from the Terminal Tower. By , Feller, along with Ken Keltner, Mel Harder and Lou Boudreau led the Indians to within one game of the pennant. However, the team was wracked with dissension, with some players going so far as to request that Bradley fire manager Ossie Vitt. Reporters lampooned them as the Cleveland Crybabies. Feller, who had pitched a no-hitter to open the season and won 27 games, lost the final game of the season to unknown pitcher Floyd Giebell of the Detroit Tigers. The Tigers won the pennant and Giebell never won another major league game. Cleveland entered 1941 with a young team and a new manager; Roger Peckinpaugh had replaced the despised Vitt; but the team regressed, finishing in fourth. Cleveland would soon be depleted of two stars. Hal Trosky retired in 1941 due to migraine headaches and Bob Feller enlisted in the U.S. Navy two days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Starting third baseman Ken Keltner and outfielder Ray Mack were both drafted in 1945 taking two more starters out of the lineup. 1947‚Äì1959: The Post-War Powerhouse In Bill Veeck formed an investment group that purchased the Cleveland Indians from Bradley's group for a reported $1.6 million. The group had more than a dozen investors, most notably celebrity Bob Hope, who grew up in Cleveland, and former Tigers slugger, Hank Greenberg. He was the last owner to purchase a baseball franchise without an independent fortune, and is responsible for many innovations and contributions to baseball. A former owner of a minor league franchise in Milwaukee, Veeck brought a gift for promotion to Cleveland. At one point, Veeck hired rubber-faced Max Patkin, the \\"Clown Prince of Baseball,\\" as a coach. Patkin's appearance in the coaching box was the sort of promotional stunt that delighted fans but infuriated the American League front office. Under Veeck's leadership, one of Cleveland's most significant achievements was breaking the color barrier in the American League by signing Larry Doby, formerly a player for the Negro League's Newark Eagles in , eleven weeks after Jackie Robinson signed with the Dodgers. Similar to Robinson, Doby battled racism on and off the field but posted a .301 batting average in 1948, his first full season. A power-hitting center fielder, Doby led the American League twice in homers and was eventually elected to the Hall of Fame. Recognizing that he had acquired a solid team, Veeck soon abandoned the aging, small and lightless League Park to take up full-time residence in massive Cleveland Municipal Stadium. Prior to 1947 the Indians played most of their games at League Park, and occasionally played weekend games at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. League Park was demolished in 1951, although a portion of the original ticket booth remains. Hall of Famer Satchell Paige was the oldest Major League rookie at 42, after being drafted by the Indians from the Negro League in 1948 Making the most of the cavernous stadium, Veeck had a portable center field fence installed, which he could move in or out depending on how the distance favored the Indians against their opponents in a given series. The fence moved as much as between series opponents. Following the 1947 season, the American League countered with a rule change that fixed the distance of an outfield wall for the duration of a season. The massive stadium did, however, permit the Indians to set the then record for the largest crowd to see a Major League baseball game. On October 10, 1948, Game 5 of the World Series against the Boston Braves drew over 84,000. The record stood until the Los Angeles Dodgers drew a crowd in excess of 92,500 to watch Game 5 of the 1959 World Series at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum against the Chicago White Sox. In , needing pitching for the stretch run of the pennant race, Veeck turned to the Negro League again and signed pitching great Satchel Paige amid much controversy. Barred from Major League Baseball during his prime, Veeck's signing of the aging star in 1948 was viewed by many as another publicity stunt. At an official age of 42, Paige became the oldest rookie in Major League baseball history and the first black pitcher. Paige ended the year with a 6‚Äì1 record with a 2.48 ERA, 45 strikeouts and two shutouts. Veterans Boudreau, Keltner, and Joe Gordon had career offensive seasons, while newcomers Larry Doby and Gene Bearden also had standout seasons. The team went down to the wire with the Boston Red Sox, winning a one-game playoff, the first in American League history, to go to the World Series. In the series, the Indians defeated the Boston Braves four games to two for their first championship in 28 years. Boudreau won the American League MVP Award. Greenberg also consolidated ownership group during 1948, buying 67% from the syndicate for an undisclosed sum. The following year, the Indians would appear in a film the following year titled The Kid From Cleveland, in which Veeck had an interest. The film portrayed the team helping out a \\"troubled teenaged fan\\" and featured many members of the Indians organization. However, filming during the season cost the players valuable rest days leading to fatigue towards the end of the season. That season, Cleveland again contended before falling to third place. On September 23, 1949, Bill Veeck and the Indians buried their 1948 pennant in center field the day after they were mathematically eliminated from the pennant race. Later in 1949, Veeck's first wife (who was entitled to half of Veeck's share of the team) divorced him. With most of his money tied up in the Indians, Veeck was forced to sell the team to a syndicate headed by insurance magnate Ellis Ryan for $2.5 million. In 1950, Hank Greenberg became general manager. Ryan was forced out in in favor of Myron \\"Mike\\" Wilson. Despite this turnover in the ownership, a powerhouse team composed of Feller, Doby, Minnie Mi√±oso, Luke Easter, Bobby √Åvila, Al Rosen, Early Wynn, Bob Lemon, and Mike Garcia continued to contend through the early 1950s. However, Cleveland only won a single pennant in the decade, finishing second to the New York Yankees five times. The winningest season in franchise history came in , when the Indians finished the season with a record of 111‚Äì43 (.721). That mark set an American League record for wins which stood for 44 years until the Yankees won 114 games in 1998 (a 162-game regular season). The Indians 1954 winning percentage of .721 is still an American League record. The Indians returned to the World Series to face the New York Giants. The team could not bring home the title, however, ultimately being upset by the Giants in a sweep. The series was notable for Willie Mays' over-the-shoulder catch off the bat of Vic Wertz in Game 1. In , Mike Wilson sold the team for $3.96 million to a three-man group led by William Daley, oil tycoon Ignatius Aloysius \\"Nashe\\" O‚ÄôShaughnessy, and the return of Hank Greenberg. However, despite Daley taking control of the Indians and became chairman of the board, Wilson stayed on as the team's president. However, general manager Hank Greenberg, who was also owned 19% of the team, was unceremoniously fired in October 1957 (Greenberg abstained from the vote, and would soon sell his stake) after it was revealed that he was the mastermind behind a potential move of the club to Minneapolis. Frank Lane becomes general manager The Indians hired general manager Frank Lane, known as \\"Trader\\" Lane, away from the St. Louis Cardinals in 1957. Over the years, Lane had gained a reputation as a GM who loved to make deals. With the White Sox, Lane had made over 100 trades involving over 400 players in seven years. In a short stint in St. Louis, he traded away Red Schoendienst and Harvey Haddix. Lane summed up his philosophy when he said that the only deals he regretted were the ones that he didn't make. One of Lane's early trades in Cleveland sent Roger Maris to the Kansas City Athletics in the middle of 1958. Indians executive Hank Greenberg was not happy about the trade and neither was Maris, who said that he could not stand Lane. After Maris broke Babe Ruth's home run record, Lane defended himself by saying he still would have done the deal because Maris was unknown and he received good ballplayers in exchange. After the Maris trade, Lane acquired 25-year-old Norm Cash from the White Sox for Minnie Mi√±oso in December 1959 and traded him to Detroit before he ever played a game for the Indians, one week before the start of the season (Cash went on to hit nearly 375 home runs for the Tigers). The Indians received Steve Demeter in the deal, who would have only five at-bats for Cleveland. 1960‚Äì1993: The 30-year slump From 1960 to 1993, the Indians managed one third-place finish (in 1968) and six fourth-place finishes (in 1960, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1990, and 1992) but spent the rest of the time at or near the bottom of the standings. Curse of Rocky Colavito Rocky Colavito in 1959 In 1960, Lane made the trade that would define his tenure in Cleveland when he dealt slugging right fielder and fan favorite Rocky Colavito to the Detroit Tigers for Harvey Kuenn just before Opening Day in . It was a blockbuster trade that swapped the AL home run co- champion (Colavito) for the AL batting champion (Kuenn). After the trade, however, Colavito hit over 30 home runs four times and made three All-Star teams for Detroit and Kansas City before returning to Cleveland in . Kuenn, on the other hand, would play only one season for the Indians before departing for San Francisco in a trade for an aging Johnny Antonelli and Willie Kirkland. Akron Beacon Journal columnist Terry Pluto documented the decades of woe that followed the trade in his book The Curse of Rocky Colavito. Despite being attached to the curse, Colavito said that he never placed a curse on the Indians but that the trade was prompted by a salary dispute with Lane. Lane also engineered an unprecedented trade of managers in mid-season 1960, sending Joe Gordon to the Tigers in exchange for Jimmy Dykes. Lane left the team in 1961, but ill-advised trades continued under new GM Gabe Paul, who had previously been the GM in Cincinnati. In 1965, the Paul traded pitcher Tommy John, who went on to win 288 games in his career, and 1966 Rookie of the Year Tommy Agee to the White Sox to get Colavito back. Ownership transitions Constant ownership and management changes did not help the Indians. Team President Mike Wilson died in 1962 at age 74.\\"Cleveland Owner Succumbs\\", The Independent, Monday, August 20, 1962, Pasadena, California, United States Of America\\"Daley Elected Indians Prexy\\", Steubenville Herald Star, Thursday, September 13, 1962, Steubenville, Ohio, United States Of America Two months later, the Daley group sold the team to a group headed by general manager Gabe Paul. Three years later, in 1966, Paul sold majority stake to Vernon Stouffer, of the Stouffer's frozen-food empire. Prior to Stouffer's purchase, the team was rumored to be relocated due to poor attendance. Despite the potential for a financially strong owner, Stouffer's finances took a severe hit when the stock of Litton Industries, who had bought Stouffer's in 1967, plummeted. Consequently, the team was cash-poor, forcing Stouffer to cut the team's player development budget severely over the vigorous objections of Paul and farm director Hank Peters. By nearly all accounts, this hampered the Indians for several years to come. In order to solve some financial problems, Stouffer had made an agreement to play a minimum of 30 home games in New Orleans with a view to a possible move there. After rejecting an offer from George Steinbrenner and former Indian Al Rosen, Stouffer sold the team in 1972 to a group led by Cleveland Cavaliers and Cleveland Barons owner Nick Mileti. Stouffer said owning the Indians was \\"the longest 5 years of his life.\\" 1969 Move to the East Division Lou Piniella, the 1969 Rookie of the Year and Luis Tiant, who was selected to two All-Star Games after leaving, both left. At one point, Cleveland even traded Harry Chiti to the New York Mets, only to receive him back as the player to be named later after 15 days. The 1970s were little better, with the Indians trading away several future stars, including Graig Nettles, Dennis Eckersley, Buddy Bell and 1971 Rookie of the Year Chris Chambliss, for a number of players who made no impact. Hall of Famer Frank Robinson in 1976. In January 1973, Paul sold his remaining 7% interest in the Indians for $500,000 to become part of Steinbrenner's Cleveland-based syndicate that purchased the Yankees from CBS and team president. With Paul's departure, Phil Seghi was promoted to general manager. Several months later, it was obvious the 41-year-old Mileti had bitten off more than he could chew; Mileti publicly stepped aside as the team's chief operating officer because of \\"other pressing business commitments\\" and the ownership structure was change to a limited partnership from a corporation (primarily to save on taxes). MLB, which had to approve the transition, initially blocked the move. It was later approved in May 1973 at a league meeting after much wrangling and accusations that the Indians were \\"undercapitalized.\\" Accordingly, minority owner Alva T. \\"Ted\\" Bonda assumed control of day-to-day operations with the title of executive vice president. The team was unable to move out of the cellar, with losing seasons between 1969 and 1975. One highlight was the acquisition of Gaylord Perry in . The Indians traded fireballer \\"Sudden Sam\\" McDowell for Perry, who became the first Indian pitcher to win the Cy Young Award. In , Cleveland broke another color barrier with the hiring of Frank Robinson as Major League Baseball's first African American manager; another move by Bonda that further strained relations with Mileti. Robinson served as player-manager and would provide a franchise highlight when he hit a pinch hit home run on Opening Day. But the high-profile signing of Wayne Garland, a 20-game winner in Baltimore, proved to be a disaster after Garland suffered from shoulder problems and went 28‚Äì48 over five years. The team failed to improve with Robinson as manager. The 1970s also featured the infamous Ten Cent Beer Night at Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The ill-conceived promotion at a game against the Texas Rangers ended in a riot by fans and a forfeit by the Indians. In 1977, 22-year old pitcher Dennis Eckersley threw a no-hitter against the California Angels on May 30, on his way to an all-star appearance. However, Robinson was fired after a 26‚Äì31 start, and replaced by former Dodgers catcher Jeff Torborg. Also in 1977, Mileti's group sold the team for $11 million to a syndicate headed by trucking magnate Francis J. \\"Steve\\" O'Neill and including former general manager and owner Gabe Paul, who sold his interest in the Yankees. The next season, near the end of spring training, Eckersley was dealt to the Boston Red Sox where he won 20 games in 1978 and another 17 in 1979. Instead the Tribe would lose 90 games in 1978. Torborg's 1979 team struggled, with a 43‚Äì52 record, which cost him his job just after the all-star break. In July, Dave Garcia took the helm as manager, as the team finished out the season 38‚Äì28. The new decade of the 1980s brought some bright spots. In May 1981, Len Barker threw a perfect game against the Toronto Blue Jays, joining Addie Joss as the only other Indian pitcher to do so. \\"Super Joe\\" Charbonneau won the American League Rookie of the Year award. Unfortunately, Charboneau was out of baseball by 1983 after falling victim to back injuries and Barker, who was also hampered by injuries, never became a consistently dominant starting pitcher. Eventually, the Indians traded Barker to the Atlanta Braves for Brett Butler and Brook Jacoby, who would become mainstays of the team for the remainder of the decade. Butler and Jacoby were joined by Joe Carter, Mel Hall, Julio Franco and Cory Snyder, which brought new hope to fans in the late 1980s. The team was award the 1981 All-Star Game, but even that was marred. The game was scheduled to be played on July 14, but was cancelled due to the players' strike lasting from June 12 to July 31. The game was held on August 9, as a prelude to regular season play resuming on August 10. The National League beat the American League 5‚Äì4 in front of 72,086 people in attendance at Cleveland Stadium, which broke the stadium's own record of 69,751 set in 1954, setting the still-standing record for the highest attendance in an All Star Game. It was Cleveland Stadium's fourth All-Star Game, which is a record for hosting the midsummer classic. It was just the second All-Star Game to be played outside of the month of July (the other being the second 1959 game). O'Neill's death in 1983 led to the team going on the market once more. His son, Patrick O'Neill, did not find a buyer until real estate magnates Richard and David Jacobs purchased the team in 1986. After a rare winning season in , Sports Illustrated, with Carter and Snyder pictured on the cover, boldly predicted the Indians to win the American League East in . Instead, the team went on to lose 101 games and finish with the worst record in baseball, a fate attributed to the Sports Illustrated cover jinx. Cleveland's struggles over the 30-year span were highlighted in the 1989 film Major League, which comically depicted a hapless Cleveland ball club going from worst to first by the end of the film. Organizational turnaround The Indians playing host to the Milwaukee Brewers at Cleveland Municipal Stadium during a 1993 home game. Throughout the 1980s, Indians owners had pushed for a new stadium. Cleveland Stadium had been a symbol of the Indians' glory years in the 1940s and 1950s. However, during the lean years even crowds of 40,000 were swallowed up by the cavernous environment. The old stadium was not aging gracefully; chunks of concrete were falling off in sections and the old wooden pilings now petrified. In 1984, a proposal for a $150 million domed stadium was defeated in a referendum 2‚Äì1. Finally, in May 1990, Cuyahoga County voters passed an excise tax on sales of alcohol and cigarettes in the county. The tax proceeds would be used to finance the building of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex which would include Jacobs Field and Gund Arena for the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team. The team had new ownership and a new stadium on the way. They now needed a winning team. The team's fortunes started to turn in , ironically with a very unpopular trade. The team sent power-hitting outfielder Joe Carter to the San Diego Padres for two unproven players, Sandy Alomar Jr. and Carlos Baerga. Alomar made an immediate impact, not only being elected to the All-Star team but also winning Cleveland's fourth Rookie of the Year award and a Gold Glove. Baerga would become a three-time All-Star with consistent offensive production. Indians general manager John Hart made a number of moves that would finally bring success to the team. In , he hired former Indian Mike Hargrove to manage and traded catcher Eddie Taubensee to the Houston Astros who, with a surplus of outfielders, were willing to part with Kenny Lofton. Lofton finished second in AL Rookie of the Year balloting with a .285 average and 66 stolen bases. The Indians were named \\"Organization of the Year\\" by Baseball America in 1992, in response to the appearance of offensive bright spots and an improving farm system. The team suffered a tragedy during spring training of , when a boat carrying pitchers Steve Olin, Tim Crews, and Bob Ojeda crashed into a pier. Olin and Crews were killed, and Ojeda was seriously injured. (Ojeda missed most of the season, and would retire the following year). By the end of the 1993 season, the team was in transition, leaving Cleveland Stadium and fielding a talented nucleus of young players. Many of those players came from the Indians' new AAA farm team, the Charlotte Knights, who won the International League title that year. 1994‚Äì2000: Central Division is created New beginning Progressive Field Indians General Manager John Hart and team owner Richard Jacobs managed to turn the team's fortunes around. The Indians opened Jacobs Field in 1994 with the aim of improving on the prior season's sixth-place finish. The Indians were only one game behind the division-leading Chicago White Sox on August 12 when a players strike wiped out the rest of the season. The strike also led to an absurdity: The Minnesota Twins traded Dave Winfield to the Cleveland Indians at the trade waiver deadline on August 31 for a \\"player to be named later.\\" The 1994 season had been halted two weeks earlier (it was eventually canceled a month later on September 14), so Winfield did not get to play for the Indians that year and no player was ever named in exchange. To settle the trade, Cleveland and Minnesota executives went to dinner, with the Indians picking up the tab. This makes Winfield the only player in major league history to be traded for a dinner.Though official sources list the transaction as a sale (sold by the Minnesota Twins to the Cleveland Indians). 1995 season: first since 1954 Having contended for the division in the aborted 1994 season, Cleveland sprinted to a 100‚Äì44 record (18 games were lost to player/owner negotiations) in 1995 winning its first ever divisional title. Veterans Dennis Mart√≠nez, Orel Hershiser and Eddie Murray combined with a young core of players including Albert Belle, Jim Thome, Manny Ram√≠rez and Charles Nagy to lead the league in team batting average as well as team ERA. After defeating the Boston Red Sox in the Division Series and the Seattle Mariners in the ALCS, Cleveland clinched a World Series berth, for the first time since 1954. The World Series ended in disappointment with the Indians falling in six games to the Atlanta Braves. The Indians repeated as AL Central champions in , but lost to the Baltimore Orioles in the Division Series. Notably in 1996, tickets for every home game for the Indians sold out before opening day. 1997 season: two outs away... In 1997 Cleveland started slow but finished with an 86‚Äì75 record. Taking their third consecutive AL Central title, the Indians defeated the heavily favored New York Yankees in the Division Series, 3‚Äì2. After defeating the Baltimore Orioles in the ALCS, Cleveland went on to face the Florida Marlins in the World Series which featured the coldest game in World Series history. With the series tied after game six, the Indians went into the ninth inning of Game 7 with a 2‚Äì1 lead, but closer Jos√© Mesa allowed the Marlins to tie the game. In the eleventh inning, √âdgar Renter√≠a drove in the winning run giving the Marlins their first championship. Cleveland became the first team to lose the World Series after carrying the lead into the bottom of the ninth inning of the seventh game. In his 2002 autobiography, Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel blamed Jos√© Mesa for the loss, which led to a feud between the players. 1998‚Äì2001 In , the Indians made the playoffs for the fourth straight year. After defeating the wild-card Boston Red Sox three games to one in the first round of the playoffs, Cleveland lost the 1998 ALCS in six games to the New York Yankees, who had come into the playoffs with 114 wins in the regular season. For the season, Cleveland added relief pitcher Ricardo Rinc√≥n and Roberto Alomar, brother of catcher Sandy Alomar, and won the Central Division title for its fifth consecutive playoff appearance. The team scored 1,009 runs, becoming the first (and to date only) team since the 1950 Boston Red Sox to score more than 1,000 runs in a season. This time, Cleveland did not make it past the first round, losing the Division Series to the Red Sox, despite taking a two-games-to-none lead in the series. In game three, Indians starter Dave Burba went down with an injury in the 4th inning. Four pitchers, including presumed game four starter Jaret Wright, surrendered nine runs in relief. Without a long reliever or emergency starter on the playoff roster, Hargrove started both Bartolo Col√≥n and Charles Nagy in games four and five on only three days rest. The Indians lost game four 23‚Äì7 and game five 12‚Äì8. Four days later, Hargrove was dismissed as manager. In , the Indians had a 44‚Äì42 start, but caught fire after the All Star break and went 46‚Äì30 the rest of the way to finish 90‚Äì72. The team had one of the league's best offenses that year and a defense that yielded three gold gloves. However, they ended up five games behind the Chicago White Sox in the Central division and missed the wild card by one game to the Seattle Mariners. Mid-season trades brought Bob Wickman and Jake Westbrook to Cleveland, and free agent Manny Ram√≠rez departed for Boston after the season. The Indians set a Major League record for most pitchers used in a single season. Colon, Burba, and Chuck Finley posted strong seasons, and the bullpen was solid. But with Jaret Wright and Charles Nagy spending months on the disabled list, the team could not solidify the final two spots in the rotation. Other starting pitchers that season combined for a total of 346‚Öî innings and 265 earned runs for an ERA of 6.88. In 2000, Larry Dolan bought the Indians for $320 million from Richard Jacobs, who, along with his late brother David, had paid $45 million for the club in 1986. The sale set a record at the time for the sale of a baseball franchise. saw a return to the playoffs. After the departures of Manny Ram√≠rez and Sandy Alomar Jr., the Indians signed Ellis Burks and former MVP Juan Gonz√°lez, who helped the Indians win the Central division with a 91‚Äì71 record. On June 2 Jacob Cruz was traded for Jody Gerut and Josh Bard. One of the highlights came on August 5, 2001, when the Indians completed the biggest comeback in MLB History. Cleveland rallied to close a 14‚Äì2 deficit in the sixth inning to defeat the Seattle Mariners 15‚Äì14 in 11 innings. The Mariners, who won a record 116 games that season, had a strong bullpen, and Indians manager Charlie Manuel had already pulled many of his starters with the game seemingly out of reach. Seattle and Cleveland met in the first round of the playoffs, with the Indians taking a two-games-to-one lead. However, with Freddy Garcia, Jamie Moyer and a strong bullpen, the Mariners won Games 4 and 5 to deny the Indians their first playoff series victory since 1998. In the 2001 offseason, GM John Hart resigned and his assistant Mark Shapiro took the reins. 2002‚Äì2010: Shapiro years First \\"rebuilding of the team\\" Shapiro moved to rebuild by dealing aging veterans for younger talent. He traded Roberto Alomar to the New York Mets for a package that included outfielder Matt Lawton and prospects Alex Escobar and Billy Traber. When the team fell out of contention in mid-, Shapiro fired manager Charlie Manuel and traded pitching ace Bartolo Col√≥n for prospects Brandon Phillips, Cliff Lee, and Grady Sizemore; acquired Travis Hafner from the Rangers for Ryan Drese and Einar D√≠az; and picked up Coco Crisp from the St. Louis Cardinals for aging starter Chuck Finley. Jim Thome left after the season, going to the Phillies for a larger contract. Young Indians teams finished far out of contention in 2002 and under new manager Eric Wedge. They posted strong offensive numbers in , but continued to struggle with a bullpen that blew more than 20 saves. A highlight of the season was a 22‚Äì0 victory over the New York Yankees on August 31, one of the worst defeats suffered by the Yankees in team history. In early , the offense got off to a poor start. After a brief July slump, the Indians caught fire in August, and cut a 15.5 game deficit in the Central Division down to 1.5 games. However, the season came to an end as the Indians went on to lose six of their last seven games, five of them by one run, missing the playoffs by only two games. Shapiro was named Executive of the Year in 2005.http://www.cleveland.com/tribe/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/sports/1194342071241541.xml&coll;=2The next season, the club made several roster changes, while retaining its nucleus of young players. The off-season was highlighted by the acquisition of top prospect Andy Marte from the Boston Red Sox. The Indians had a solid offensive season, led by career years from Travis Hafner and Grady Sizemore. Hafner, despite missing the last month of the season, tied the single season grand slam record of six, which was set in by Don Mattingly. Despite the solid offensive performance, the bullpen struggled with 23 blown saves (a Major League worst), and the Indians finished a disappointing fourth. In , Shapiro signed veteran help for the bullpen and outfield in the offseason. Veterans Aaron Fultz, and Joe Borowski joined Rafael Betancourt in the Indians bullpen. Shapiro also signed right fielder Trot Nixon and left fielder David Dellucci to short-term contracts for veteran leadership. The Indians improved significantly over the prior year and went into the All-Star break in second place. The team brought back Kenny Lofton for his third stint with the team in late July. The Indians finished with a 96‚Äì66 record tied with the Red Sox for best in baseball, their seventh Central Division title in 13 years and their first post-season trip since 2001. Indians fans celebrate as the team clinches the 2007 division title The Indians began their playoff run by defeating the New York Yankees in the American League Division Series three games to one. This series will be most remembered for the swarm of bugs that overtook the field in the later innings of game 2. They also jumped out to a three-games- to-one lead over the Red Sox in the American League Championship Series. The season ended in disappointment when Boston swept the final three games to advance to the 2007 World Series. Despite the loss, Cleveland players took home a number of awards. Grady Sizemore, who had a .995 fielding percentage and only two errors in 405 chances, won the Gold Glove award, Cleveland's first since 2001. Indians Pitcher CC Sabathia won the second Cy Young Award in team history with a 19‚Äì7 record, a 3.21 ERA and an MLB-leading 241 innings pitched. Eric Wedge was awarded the first Manager of the Year Award in team history. Shapiro was named to his second Executive of the Year in 2007. Second \\"rebuilding of the team\\" The Indians struggled during the 2008 season. Injuries to sluggers Travis Hafner and Victor Martinez, as well as starting pitchers Jake Westbrook and Fausto Carmona led to a poor start. The Indians, falling to last place for a short time in June and July, traded CC Sabathia to the Milwaukee Brewers for prospects Matt LaPorta, Rob Bryson, and Michael Brantley. and traded starting third baseman Casey Blake for catching prospect Carlos Santana. However, amid the mediocrity, some key players, such as shortstop Jhonny Peralta and catcher Kelly Shoppach, who took over starting duties after Martinez was injured, began to shine. Pitcher Cliff Lee went 22‚Äì3 with an ERA of 2.54 and earned the AL Cy Young Award. Grady Sizemore had a career year, winning a Gold Glove and Silver Slugger, and the Indians finished with a record of 81‚Äì81. Prospects for the 2009 season dimmed early when the Indians ended May with a record of 22‚Äì30. Shapiro made multiple trades: Cliff Lee and Ben Francisco to the Philadelphia Phillies for prospects Jason Knapp, Carlos Carrasco, Jason Donald and Lou Marson; Victor Martinez to the Boston Red Sox for prospects Bryan Price, Nick Hagadone and Justin Masterson; Ryan Garko to the Texas Rangers for Scott Barnes; and Kelly Shoppach to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for Mitch Talbot. The Indians finished the season tied for last in their division, with a record of 65‚Äì97. The team announced on September 30, 2009, that Eric Wedge and all of the team's coaching staff would be released at the end of the 2009 season. Manny Acta was hired as the team's 40th manager on October 25, 2009. On February 18, 2010, it was announced that Shapiro (following the end of the 2010 season) would be promoted to team President, with current President Paul Dolan becoming the new Chairman/CEO, and longtime Shapiro assistant Chris Antonetti filling the GM role. 2011‚Äìpresent: GM Chris Antonetti On January 18, 2011, longtime popular former first baseman and manager Mike Hargrove was brought in as a special adviser. The Indians started 2011 red-hot, going 30‚Äì15 in their first 45 games. The team remained around .500 and kept pace with the division leading Tigers through August, just 1.5 games behind them with a record of 54‚Äì51 on July 28. However, after that point, the team collapsed, going 26‚Äì31 after that period, and finished 80‚Äì82, but in second place in the AL Central, 15 games behind Detroit. Their record was the team's best since 2008 and a 15-game improvement over 2010. The Tribe went into 2012 thinking they could contend for the Wild Card spot. They started the year well, leading the Central for most of April and May and switching places with Chicago in June. They entered the All-Star Break 44‚Äì41, just 3 games behind the White Sox for 1st place. The team looked poised for at least a winning season. The team deflated after the All-Star Game, going 9‚Äì19 immediately afterward and just 24‚Äì53 after July 10 to finish 68‚Äì94, their worst record since 1991. The Indians soon fired their manager and hired Terry Francona, who led the Red Sox to the playoffs in 5 of his last 7 seasons and 2 World Series titles in 4 years, including their first title since 1918. They also cut several minor players, including Grady Sizemore, who played only 1/4 of the previous 3 seasons due to injury, none in 2012. All of the changes led to good hopes for 2013, and the team was up and down for most of May, but returned to winning form in June.

The J1 had over of tractive effort, plus an additional if the booster engine was used.  Features  As with many of the Pennsylvania Railroad's steam locomotives, the J1 had its headlight above the smokebox. Like the M1 the J1 had a keystone numberplate, unlike the round numberplates seen on the rest of the PRR's freight steam locomotives. Wartime restrictions forbid the design of a completely new engine so the PRR basically adopted the C&O; design almost without change. As a result, they were equipped with Baker valve gear instead of Walschaerts valve gear which was more common on the PRR. Additionally, they had radial-stay fireboxes instead of the Belpaire fireboxes seen on nearly all of the Pennsylvania Railroad's steam locomotives. Mechanically, these locomotives were identical to the C&O;'s T-1 class 2-10-4s. As initially built, the middle driver was blind to facilitate tracking on curves. With experience the railroad determined that this wasn't necessary and after shopping the middle driver was equipped with flanges. The engine did have lateral motion devices to allow some sideways drive axle travel which did enable it to work on Pennsy curves. Other PRR changes included the curved front side cab windows, and the cast pilot with drop coupler.  History  During World War II the Pennsylvania Railroad needed heavier locomotives to pull freight and military equipment, but wartime restrictions prohibited the development of a new locomotive design. In response to this the Pennsylvania Railroad borrowed a 2-6-6-4 Class A of the Norfolk & Western Railway and a 2-10-4 from the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. Both locomotives underwent extensive testing, with the C&O; 2-10-4 chosen to be produced. A total of 125 were built at PRR's shops in Juniata, Pennsylvania. They came to be known as the PRR's \\"War Babies,\\" but the J1's remained in service into the 1950s. When the Pennsylvania Railroad converted from steam power to diesel, the PRR scrapped most of them in 1958 with the exception of 25. The remaining 25 were scrapped in 1959.

Halloween on Franklin Street is a yearly tradition in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that encompasses a massive gathering on Franklin Street, the cultural hub of the town.

Accessed November 16, 2008 Attendees of the event dress up in creative Halloween costumes and walk up and down Franklin Street celebrating the holiday. Since its beginnings, the event had grown in size every year until 2008. Although not sponsored by the Town of Chapel Hill, the celebration has become an attraction for visitors from across the South. Between 2004 and 2007, it was estimated that about 80,000 people converged on Franklin Street for the event,Hartness, Erin:\\"Chapel Hill wants to scale back Halloween celebration\\" September 22, 2008. accessed November 16, 2008 while Chapel Hill is estimated to have a population of 54,492 as listed in the 2007 census, evidence of the number of people who make the trip to Chapel Hill to attend. Because of the size of the celebration, the Town of Chapel Hill closes Franklin Street to all vehicular traffic and prohibits parking anywhere near downtown. Along with the big crowds come safety issues, with some of the biggest concerns being alcohol poisoning and gang-related violence. To deal with these issues, hundreds of police officers patrol the downtown area throughout the entire night. In 2007, approximately 400 police officers were deployed to Franklin Street to ensure that nothing got out of hand.WTVD-TV/DT, \\"Chapel Hill: No outsiders allowed at Halloween party\\" October 15, 2008. Accessed November 17, 2008 In 2008, the Town of Chapel Hill implemented new measures to attempt to cut down on the size of the Halloween celebration in an action dubbed \\"Homegrown Halloween\\" to reduce the crowd size and discourage people from out of town to come to Chapel Hill. The shuttle service that had formerly transported people from park and ride lots to Franklin Street was shut down and the results of Chapel Hill's efforts showed when about 35,000 people showed up for the event.Johnson, Andrew, \\"Slideshow: Halloween ends early\\" November 2, 2008.

The planetarium closes by mid- afternoon on Halloween because the adjacent parking lot becomes a staging area for public safety vehicles serving the Franklin Street nighttime celebration. Security For the Town of Chapel Hill, one of the biggest concerns during the event is safety. With crowds of up to 80,000 people, security measures can be difficult to implement, with two of the biggest issues being binge drinking and gang-related activities. Although the celebration is not a town-sponsored event, on average, officials call for around 400 law enforcement officers to control crowds and patrol the streets. During the 2008 celebration, along with other new security measures, officials required bars and restaurants in the downtown area to stop selling alcohol and close their doors at 1:00 a.m. Another action taken by town officials meant to help curb drinking was that of requiring all bars in the downtown area to charge patrons a five-dollar cover charge to get in.Town of Chapel Hill; Update on Halloween on Franklin Street, October 15, 2008 Police began clearing the streets at midnight and made only five arrests throughout the event, down from thirteen arrests at the 2007 celebration.WRAL.com; Fewer arrests, injuries reported on Franklin Street, November 1, 2008 Prohibited items * Alcoholic beverages * Weapons * Paint * Glass bottles * Fireworks * Coolers * Animals * Fake weapons (Part of Costumes) Costumes One of the most popular elements of Halloween on Franklin Street is the originality of the costumes of attendees.

It is a simple methyl ester derivative of its parent compound, pulvinic acid, and a close relative of pulvinone, both of which derive from aromatic amino acids such as phenylalanine via secondary metabolism. The roles of vulpinic acid are not fully established, but may include properties that make it an antifeedant for herbivores. The compound is relatively toxic to mammals. Chemical description Vulpinic acid was first isolated from lichens in 1925. As an isolated, purified substance, it is bright yellow in color. Vulpinic acid is derived biosynthetically by esterification from pulvinic acid; pulvinate itself derives from the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine, via dimerization and oxidative ring-cleavage of arylpyruvic acids, a process that also produces the related pulvinones. There have been several chemical syntheses reported for vulpinic acid. In one, butenolides were efficiently functionalized by Suzuki cross-coupling reactions via the corresponding enol triflates. Occurrence in lichens  The lichen Letharia vulpina, whose bright color is due in part to vulpinic acid. Pulvinic acid found in several lichen species, as well as some non-lichenized fungi. It is a secondary metabolite of the fungal partner in the lichen symbiosis. It was found in the bolete fungus Pulveroboletus ravenelii. In 2016, a new group of basidiomycetes distinct from the well known lichen fungal partner was implicated in producing vulpinic acid. Bioactivities Vulpinic acid is relatively toxic to meat- eating mammals as well as insects and molluscs. However, it is not toxic to rabbits and mice. One biological function of vulpinic acid may be as a repellent that lichens have evolved to deter grazing by herbivores. Lichens may also exploit the ultraviolet-blocking properties of the molecule, protecting the underlying photobionts. For example, vulpinic acid is thought to function as a blue light screen in Letharia vulpina. It had been shown previously to protect human skin cells in tissue culture against ultraviolet B-induced damage. Humans have exploited its mammalian toxicity, using lichens containing high amounts of the chemical (e.g., Letharia vulpina) to poison wolves in Scandinavia, sometimes adding it to baits containing reindeer blood and glass. Vulpinic acid has some antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, and has been shown to disrupt cell division in MRSA.

Like other gasteroid fungi, Calostoma do not have the spore discharge mechanism associated with typical gilled fungi (ballistospory), and instead have enclosed spore-bearing structures. Resembling round puffballs with raised, brightly-colored spore openings (osteoles), elevated on a thick, gelatinous stalks, species have been collected in regions of deciduous, temperate, tropical or subtropical forests. Their distribution includes eastern North America, Central America, Asia, and Australasia. The common name given to some species, \\"prettymouth\\", alludes to the brightly-colored raised openings (osteoles) that may somewhat resemble lips. Other common names include \\"hotlips\\" and \\"puffball in aspic\\". The unusual fruit body structure has historically led mycologists to suggest various classification schemes based on presumed relationships to other puffball or \\"stomach mushrooms\\". Phylogenetic analyses performed in the 2000s show the genus to be evolutionarily related to the Bolete mushrooms. Calostoma species are ectomycorrhizal, forming symbiotic associations with trees from various families. The type species, Calostoma cinnabarinum, is ectomycorrhizal with oak. Taxonomy The original genus description, based on the type species Calostoma cinnabarinum (synonymous with cinnabarina), was published by French botanist Nicaise Auguste Desvaux in 1809. Before the advent of modern genetic analysis, the Calostoma was considered to be part of the Gasteromycetes, a grouping of fungi with enclosed spore-bearing structures. Specifically, it was classified in the order of stalked puffballs, although some mycologists have suggested that the genus Calostoma should be merged with Tulostoma (xerophilic stalked puffballs), Scleroderma (hard puffballs), Geastrum (earthstars), or Pseudocolus (stinkhorns). Some authors have placed Calostoma in its own family, the Calostomataceae. In the 2000s, a phylogenetic analyses using nuclear and mitochondrial ribosomal gene sequences helped to clarify the phylogeny of Calostoma. Using the species C. cinnabarinum and C. ravenelli as representative examples, the research showed the genus evolutionarily related to the monophyletic Boletales clade, and separate from clades containing most of the gilled mushrooms, puffballs, stalked puffballs, earthstars, stinkhorns and non-bolete Gasteromycetes. Calostoma belongs to the suborder Sclerodermatineae in the Boletales order. The Boletales comprise the following genera: Boletinellus, Calostoma, Gyroporus, Phlebopus, Pisolithus, Scleroderma, and Veligaster. Calostoma is thought to have diverged evolutionarily from the other Boletales between 52‚Äì115 million years ago. The most recent age estimates suggest Calostoma diverged from the most recent common ancestor of the \\"Core Sclerodermatineae\\" at a median age of 66.02 million years ago (highest posterior density range 49.27-90.28 million years ago). The median age of the most recent common ancestor for extant Calostoma is 42.73 million years ago (highest posterior density range 28.76-57.15 million years ago). The genus name Calostoma is derived from the Greek kallos or \\"beauty\\", and stoma (œÉœÑ√≥ŒºŒ±) or \\"mouth\\"; similarly, several species are referred to in the vernacular as \\"prettymouths\\". In Korea, it is called Yongi, or \\"red cheeks\\". Description The outer tissue layer of Calostoma cinnabarinum (shown) is gelatinous. Fruit bodies, technically known as gasterocarps, form spherical spore-bearing heads with a peridium (outer tissue layer) made of two to four clearly defined layers of tissue. The outermost peridial layer is a thick gelatinous or shiny cuticle, which during maturity peels away to reveal the brightly colored peristome that has a star-shaped pore through which spores may escape. The innermost layer of the peridium is papery and membranous, and remains attached to the outer layers only at the apex of the star-shaped apical pore or slit. The fruit bodies may either have no stalk (sessile), or be atop a stalk. The stalk, made of thick, intertwined and fused cords of hyphae, is hygroscopic, and will expand upon absorbing moisture. The spore mass in the head, the gleba, is pale, and initially has thick-walled skeletal hyphae called capillitia. Clamp connections are present in the fungal hyphae. Spores The spores are spherical to elliptical in shape, and typically have surfaces that are reticulate (with interconnected grooves resembling a net) or pitted. The variations in the elaborate pitted- spore reticulations have inspired investigation with techniques such as scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The latter technique was used to distinguish subtle details (at the nanometer scale) and differences in the fine structure of the spores of various Calostoma species. The spore reticulations have purpose: they become entangled and interwoven with nurse cells and scaly hyphae, the net effect of which is to prevent the spores from being blown away simultaneously. Development When grown in humid conditions, such as might typically be found in a temperate deciduous forest, Calostoma species develop a thicker, more gelatinous exoperidium (the outermost peridial layer). As the stalk expands, the exoperidium becomes sloughed off, exposing the endoperidum and a raised peristome‚Äîthe ridge of tissue around the opening suggestive of the common name, \\"prettymouth\\". The exoperidium may help to protect the maturing gleba of late-fruiting species from harmful variations in temperature or humidity, or from insect predation. Habitat and distribution The species in Calostoma have been collected in regions of deciduous, temperate, tropical or subtropical forests, containing tree species from the families Fagaceae, Nothofagaceae, Myrtaceae, and Dipterocarpaceae. The type species C. cinnabarinum was shown to form ectomycorrhizae with Quercus species, using isotopic labeling, molecular and morphological analyses. Southeast Asian Calostoma have also been described as ectomycorrhizal. Calostoma sarasinii forms ectomycorrhizae with species of Lithocarpus (Fagaceae) while Calostoma retisporum forms ectomycorrhizae with species from the Myrtaceae. The ectomycorrhizal mode of nutrition is predominant in the Sclerodermatineae suborder. Historically, it had been assumed to be saprobic, due to its taxonomic uncertainty, and presumed relatedness to other saprobic fungi like the stalked puffballs and the earthstars. The distribution of the genus is limited to Australasia (Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea), Southeast Asia, Asia, and North and Central America. Species have been described from Indonesia (Borneo, Java, Sumatra, New Guinea), Sri Lanka, Himalaya, Nepal, China, New Zealand, North America, and Latin America. Australian species include C. fuhreri, C. fuscum, C. insigne, C. rodwayi, and C. viride. David Arora mentions a preference for humid forests in eastern North America, particularly in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Uses Edibility In general, Calostoma species are not considered edible; because they typically begin their development underground, by the time fruit bodies appear they are too tough for consumption. However, a 2009 study reported that in the community of Tenango de Doria (Hidalgo state, Mexico), Calostoma cinnabarinum used to be collected by children and consumed \\"like a tidbit\\", although the tradition seems to have been abandoned in recent years. Locals called the young fruit bodies \\"yemitas\\". Biochemistry Calostoma cinnabarinum contains a pigment named calostomal that is responsible for its red color. The IUPAC name of this molecule is all-trans-16-oxohexadeca-2,4,6,8,10,12,14-heptaenoic acid.

Both Tim9 and Tim10 form a hexamer, the Tim9-Tim10 complex, that when associated, functions as a chaperone to assist translocation of preproteins from the outer mitochondrial membrane to the translocase of the inner membrane. The functional Tim9-Tim10 complex not only directs preproteins to the inner mitochondrial membrane in order to interact with the TIM22 complex, but also guides Œ≤-barrel precursor proteins to the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) of the outer membrane. Structure of the Tim9-Tim10 complex The Tim9-Tim10 complex is made up of three Tim9 molecules and three Tim10 molecules. Each Tim9 and Tim10 subunit consists of 80-110 amino acid residues with four conserved cysteine residues that form two intramolecular disulfide bonds.Webb, C.T., Gorman, M.A., Lazarou, M., Ryan, M.T., Gulbis, J.M. (2006) Crystal structure of the mitochondrial chaperone TIM9.10 reveals a six-bladed alpha- propeller. Mol. Cell. 21(1): 123-133. Each subunit folds into a helix-loop- helix structure, with each loop forming a donut shape that comprises the upper face of the complex. The structure of the Tim9-Tim10 complex takes on the form of an Œ±-propeller, with two helical blades radiating from a narrow central pore. Biogenesis of the small Tims Small Tim proteins are synthesised lacking a cleavable presequence, but instead containing internal targeting information and need to be imported to the intermembrane space. The intermembrane space import and assembly machinery (MIA) is believed to mediate transport of the small Tim precursors into the intermembrane space subcompartment.Mesecke, N., Terziyska, N., Kozany, C., Baumann, F., Neupert, W., Hell, K., Herrmann, JM. (2005) A disulphide relay system in the intermembrane space of mitochondria that mediates protein import. Cell 121: 1059-1069. MIA is composed of two main essential cysteine-rich proteins; Mia40 and Erv1. Mia40 is also referred to as Tim40 in yeast and deficiency of Mia40 has been reported to affect import of the small Tims. Mia40 is anchored to the mitochondrial inner membrane via an N-terminal hydrophobic segment, exposing a large domain to the intermembrane space. It contains 6 conserved cysteine residues, which allow the binding of incoming Tim precursor proteins.Chacinska, A., Pfannschimdt, S., Wiedemann, N., Kozjak, V., Sanju√°n Szklarz, LK., Schulze-Specking, A., Truscott, KN., Guiard, B., Meisinger, C., Pfanner, N.(2004) Essential role of Mia40 in import and assembly of intermembrane space proteins. EMBO J 23: 3735-3746. Following import of small Tim proteins into the intermembrane space Mia40 interacts with small Tim proteins via disulfide bonds. Following isomerisation of the disulfide bridge, the polypeptide is released. Mia40 which is now in reduced state, is then oxidised by Erv1.Tokatlidis, K. (2005) A disulphide relay system in mitochondria. Cell 121(7): 965-967. This oxidation step is vital to facilitate further rounds of precursor protein import. Without Erv1 activity, reduced Mia40 accumulates and is in inactive conformation. Interaction between the incoming precursor proteins, Mia40 and Erv1, is maintained as a result of a flow of electrons that are transferred from the incoming protein to Mia40 and from reduced Mia40 to oxidised Erv1. Precursors are then released in oxidised state and form disulfide bridges which prevents their escape out of the intermembrane space. Small Tim proteins are then maintained in active conformation within the intermembrane space by Hot13 (helper of Tims).Curran, S.P., Leuenberger, D., Leverich, E.P., Hwang, D.K., Beverly, K.N., Koehler, C.M. (2004) The role of Hot13p and redox chemistry in the mitochondrial TIM22 import pathway. J. Biol. Chem. 279(42): 43744-43751. It is possible that Hot13 may have reducing effects on small Tim proteins as they counterbalance the harmful effects that oxidative agents exhibit.

Quill is owned by Staples, Inc., and is recognized as their most profitable division, accounting for about 25% of the company's net income. Between 1998 and 2009, Quill grew from $500 million in revenues to over $1 billion. It employs approximately 500 people and has twelve distribution centers, led by its president Sergio Pereira.https://www.linkedin.com/company/quill  History  Jack Miller (middle), the founder, with his older brother Arnold (left) and younger brother Harvey (right) in the early days of Quill Corporation. Quill Corporation was the outgrowth of an idea by Jack Miller. In 1956, with a loan of $2,000 from Jack's father-in-law Quill's first office was established in the back room of Millers father's poultry shop on the north side of Chicago.http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/quill-corporation- history/ Initially lacking retail experience, the young entrepreneur relied heavily on his face-to-face selling techniques to drive revenue. With the assistance of Jack's brother Harvey, the two evolved their marketing strategies to include mail-order campaigns that enticed potential customers with substantially discounted prices and free shipping - transforming Quill Corporation into one of the first mail-order companies in the United States. In 1974, Quill reported annual sales of $3.5 million. During the early and mid-1980s, the company's revenues amounted to $180 million in 1986. Its mail- order business was the most successful within the office supplies market, with more than 40 million catalogues and flyers sent to a customer base of approximately 600,000 businesses and organizations, and listing more than 9,000 various office supplies and products. In 1996, the company launched the website Quill.com. In 1998, Quill Corporation was acquired by Staples, Inc. for approximately $685 million. Jack Miller utilized funds from the sale of Quill to create the Jack Miller Center.https://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/08/business/fi-37095  Online  The domain quill.com attracted at least one million visitors annually by 2008, according to a Compete.com survey.http://siteanalytics.compete.com/quill.com/?metric=uv Quill Corporation launched a Quill coupons page in 2014 to help customers find even better deals on the site.

History  The friary of the Franciscans in Copenhagen was founded in 1238 by Countess Ingerd of Revenstein. She was one of Denmark's wealthiest women of the period, a member of the powerful Hvide family. She was the daughter of , and the sister of Bishop of Roskilde. She had become acquainted with the Franciscans, a relatively new order, while she lived in Germany with her husband. She founded several Franciscan houses in Denmark, including the one in Copenhagen, to whom she gave the farm which stood at the time outside the town. The friary was run by the Guardian and several brothers with specific responsibilities for the hospital, guest house, and so forth. Over time the friary acquired several properties scattered through Copenhagen which provided a good income through rents. Though it was officially forbidden for the friars to receive money, the rule was bent enough to make life a little easier for them, who were nicknamed the \\"beggar monks\\" because they could be seen on the streets asking for gifts of food. The friary also received remuneration for praying for the souls of the recently departed. The friary consisted at its height of a church, a refectory, a great hall which was used on many occasions for important state meetings and meetings of the provincial which governed Franciscan monasteries in Denmark. Within the enclosing walls could be found a guesthouse, a hospital for the sick and poor, quarters for lay brothers, a large garden, a brewery, and an apple orchard. They also maintained a house for a brother at Drag√∏r. The Franciscan church was renowned for its many relics, including those of Saint Olav, Saint Erik, Saint Canute, Saint Eskil, Abbot Vilhelm, Saint Bridget, Saint Willehad, and many others.  Dissolution  Already in the 1520s many people in Copenhagen flocked to hear the preaching of the new Lutheran doctrines. Many Danes felt that the tithes and additional requests to fund religious houses were excessive and an early target of the anti-Catholic party were the \\"beggar monks\\". Led by the mayor of Copenhagen, the town fathers made it illegal for monks or friars to go out into the street to beg for food or alms. Because it was done lawfully, the guardian and vice-guardian of the friary had no redress and therefore wrote a letter dated 25 April 1530 conveying the friary and its contents and properties away from the Franciscan order, with an explanation of the reasons for abandoning it: \\"...Since we are required for the sake of many weighty reasons, and the ordinary people in Copenhagen will not permit us [to be] here... and we are locked inside [our friary] and may not go into the street to ask for God's alms.\\" The brothers abandoned the friary immediately thereafter.The account of the expulsion of the Franciscans from Copenhagen is missing from the Chronicle of the Expulsion of the Grayfriars, a collection of eyewitness accounts from brothers who were driven from their houses between 1527 and 1532 Eight of the brothers who had learned a craft removed their habits, married and settled down in Copenhagen with the help of the magistrate and citizens. Several months passed before the crown administrators decided that the church, conventual buildings and burial ground would be turned over to the University of Copenhagen for income. New streets were laid out through the former garden and apple orchard. Rent from the houses owned by the friary were used to support the hospital. Frederik I issued a royal decree on 6 August 1532 which changed all of that: the monastery, church and income-producing houses were now all given over to fund the work of the hospital for the benefit of the poor and sick. The church tower was a visible part of the city skyline as late as 1596. The huge cellars of the friary became the town jail and eventually the church itself was converted to a prison. In 1621 Christian IV added an orphanage and recommissioned the church as a house of worship, though it was called the \\"Prison Church\\". The friary buildings were mostly destroyed in the fires of 1728 and 1807. Others were pulled down to make room for private houses and businesses. Parts of the thick outside walls and conventual buildings were incorporated into new structures near Grayfriars Market Square in Copenhagen, but there is today little evidence of the hundreds of years of occupancy by the Franciscans at Grayfriars.

In July 1999, Grant was elected Provincial Secretary General at the Provincial General Conference, a position he held until the PGC in 2005 where he was elected Provincial Chair.He has also managed the ACDP's provincial elections campaigns for 2004, 2006, 2009 and 2011. In the December 2000 Local Government Elections he was elected ACDP Councillor in the City of Cape Town and Caucus Leader. At the 2004 National General Elections, Grant was elected to the Western Cape Provincial Parliament as a Member of Provincial Parliament. As Provincial Chairman he played a key role for the party when it challenged the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in the Western Cape High Court, the Electoral Court and South Africa's Constitutional Court on their decision to exclude the ACDP from contesting the Local Government Elections in Cape Town on 1 March 2006. After the party lost in the two lower courts, the matter ultimately went to the Constitutional Court where the party won just five days before Election Day, forcing the IEC to print new ballot papers and allowing the party just a few days to campaign. Grant played another key role in the formation and success of South Africa's first multi-party government - in the City of Cape Town, after no party won a majority. The election results were that the Democratic Alliance won 90 seats and the African National Congress 81, but at least 106 seats were needed to form a government of the 210 seats in Council. Grant chaired the ACDP's negotiating team which first brought seven smaller parties together to form a king-maker block of 16 Councillors forming the \\"Multiparty Forum\\" that was chaired by the ACDP. This MPF block then agreed to work with the DA in a multi-party government (MPG), rather than with the African National Congress/Independent Democrat alliance. The MPG was elected with a majority of just one seat, an historic first for democratic South Africa, with the ACDP elected as Executive Deputy Mayor of Cape Town, Mayoral Committee member for Parks, Amenities and Sport and to two Subcouncil Chair posts. The MPG survived until January 2007 when the DA Mayor expelled the African Muslim Party for colluding with the ANC behind the MPG's back. In so doing, the MPG lost its slim majority of one seat. That same day however, Grant convened an ACDP meeting resulting in the ACDP offering its post of Executive Deputy Mayor to the Independent Democrats (ID) if they joined the MPG. This move brought stability to the MPG which now had a more comfortable majority of 122 out of 210 council seats. In March 2007, the ACDP redeployed Grant to the City of Cape Town to take up the ACDP's seat on the Mayoral Committee as political head of Parks, Amenities and Sport. After the 'walk- over window period' in September 2007 and the ensuing negotiation process with the DA on the ACDP's claim to regain the Executive Deputy Mayors seat, Grant was elected Executive Deputy Mayor of Cape Town. until the 2009 elections. He served as acting Executive Mayor of Cape Town for a brief period after Mayor Helen Zille was elected Premier-elect of the Western Cape. Their success also prompted the DA to ditch its coalition partners including the ACDP, who had helped them become the City government in the first place. During his term as Executive Deputy Mayor of Cape Town, he was political head of the City's policies and programmes on, inter alia, substance abuse, street people, orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), and international relations, opening South Africa's first municipal-run Outpatient Treatment Centres for substance abuse, and another South African first being a municipal-run toll-free referral helpline for substance abuse. He also chaired the City's 2010 Steering Committee tasked with preparing Cape Town to be a Host City for the 2010 Fifa World Cup. His term as Executive Deputy Mayor ended abruptly on 27 May 2009 when the Democratic Alliance ended its 5-year contractual agreement with the ACDP prematurely, because they wished to have one of their own members holding his post so that they (quote) 'could be as effective as possible, politically'. But while this was their stated reason, they then attempted to blame the ACDP, citing 'breaches of trust', which was thoroughly refuted by the ACDP and withdrawing from coalition with the DA in all municipalities. Ultimately, the DA confirmed their axing of the ACDP was a political decision taken to ensure further DA growth. Political career - 2009 to 2020 Grant remained a Councillor in the City of Cape Town until the 18 May 2011 Local Government Elections where he was re-elected to the same post. The party also re-elected him as their Caucus leader. In April 2012 the ACDP redeployed him to the WC Provincial Parliament as Member of Provincial Parliament where he was elected Chair of SCOPA (Standing Committee on Public Accounts), a post he held until the 2014 National General Elections when he returned to the City of Cape Town as Councillor and Caucus Leader. During the December 2013 National General Conference he was elected Chair of the ACDP's national Federal Council (FCOP). As a result of holding this post he became an ex-officio member of the ACDP's National Executive Committee (NEC). He won re- election to this post at the National General Conference in late January 2019. In July 2014 he was appointed the National Elections Manager for the 2016 Local Government Elections, meaning a second NEC post. He was re-appointed to this post in January 2019 for the National General Elections through to the 2021 Local Government Elections. Following the 2014 National General Election he returned once more to the City of Cape Town as Councillor and Caucus Leader, a post he held until January 2016 when he resigned on request of the ACDP to take up a newly created and contracted national post being the Media and Communications Director until Octovber 2016 - his third concurrent NEC post at the time. Following the 3 August 2016 Local Government Elections, Grant was re-elected City Councillor and Caucus Leader. In October that year he vacated two of the three NEC posts he held, retaining only his elected Federal Council Chair post. As at January 2020, Grant currently holds six posts: Councillor and Caucus Leader in the City of Cape Town; National Elections Manager; Federal Council Chair; Media and Communications Manager and Provincial Whip - both for the Western Cape.

Prior to version 4.5, MSE ran on , Windows Vista, and Windows 7, but not on Windows 8 and later versions, which have built-in AV components known as Windows Defender. MSE 4.5 and later versions do not run on Windows XP. The license agreement allows home users and small businesses to install and use the product free-of-charge. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, and the free Windows Defender, which only protected users from spyware until Windows8. Built upon the same scanning engine and virus definitions as other Microsoft antivirus products, it provides real-time protection, constantly monitoring activities on the computer, scanning new files as they are created or downloaded, and disabling detected threats. It lacks the OneCare personal firewall and the Forefront Endpoint Protection centralized management features. Microsoft's announcement of its own AV software on 18 November 2008, was met with mixed reactions from the AV industry. Symantec, McAfee and Kaspersky Lab‚Äîthree competing independent software vendors‚Äîdismissed it as an unworthy competitor, but AVG Technologies and Avast Software appreciated its potential to expand the consumers' choice of AV software. AVG, McAfee, Sophos and Trend Micro claimed that the integration of the product into Microsoft Windows would be a violation of competition law. The product received generally positive reviews praising its user interface, low resource usage and freeware license. It secured AV-TEST certification in October 2009, having demonstrated its ability to eliminate all widely encountered malware. It lost that certification in October 2012; in June 2013, MSE achieved the lowest possible protection score, zero. However, Microsoft significantly improved this product during the couple of years preceding February 2018, when MSE achieved AV-TEST's \\"Top Product\\" award after detecting 80% of the samples used during its test. According to a March 2012 report by anti-malware specialist OPSWAT, MSE was the most popular AV product in North America and the second most popular in the world, which has resulted in the appearance of several rogue antivirus programs that try to impersonate it.  Features  Microsoft Security Essentials automatically checks and downloads the latest virus definitions from Microsoft Update which is updated three times a day. Users may alternatively download the updates manually from the Microsoft Security Portal website. On 30 September 2011, a faulty definition update caused the product to incorrectly tag Google Chrome as malware. The issue was resolved within three hours. MSE originally ran on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7, although versions 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP and Microsoft stopped producing automatic definition updates for Windows XP on 14 July 2015 (however, manual definition updates are still available for Windows XP users who run older versions of MSE). MSE is built upon the same foundation as other Microsoft security products; they all use the same anti-malware engine known as Microsoft Malware Protection Engine (MSMPENG) and virus definitions. It does not have the personal firewall component of OneCare and the centralized management features of Forefront Endpoint Protection. MSE provides real-time protection, constantly monitoring activities on the computer, scanning new files as they are created or downloaded from the Internet. It quarantines detected threats and prompts for user input on how to deal with them. If no response is received within ten minutes, suspected threats are handled according to the default actions defined in the application's settings. Depending on those settings, it may also create System Restore checkpoints before removing the detected malware. As a part of real-time protection, MSE reports all suspicious behaviors of monitored programs to Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS, formerly Microsoft SpyNet) by default. If the report matches a newly discovered malware threat with an unreleased virus definition, the new definition will be downloaded to remove the threat. Hardware requirements for the product depend on the operating system; on a computer running Windows Vista or Windows 7, it requires a 1GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, a computer monitor with a display resolution of at least 800 √ó 600 pixels, 200MB of free hard disk space and a stable Internet connection.  Development  On 18 November 2008, Microsoft announced plans for a free consumer security product, codenamed Morro. This development marked a change in Microsoft's consumer AV marketing strategy: instead of offering a subscription-based security product with a host of other tools, such as backup and a personal firewall, Morro would offer free AV protection with a smaller impact on system resources. Amy Barzdukas, senior director of product management for the Online Services and Windows Division at Microsoft, announced that Morro would not directly compete with other commercial AV software; rather it was focused on the 50 to 60 percent of PC users who did not have or would not pay for AV protection. By 17 June 2009, the official name of Morro was revealed: Microsoft Security Essentials. On 23 June 2009, Microsoft released a public beta to 75,000 users in the United States, Israel, China and Brazil. Anticipated to be available in 20 markets and 10 languages, the product was scheduled for release before the end of 2009; the final build was released on 29 September 2009.  Version 2.0  Almost a year after the initial release, Microsoft quietly released the second version. It entered the technical preview stage on 19 July 2010, and the final build was released on 16 December 2010. It includes Network Inspection System (NIS), a network intrusion detection system that works on Windows Vista and Windows 7, as well as a new anti-malware engine that employs heuristics in malware detection. Version 2.0 integrates with Internet Explorer to protect users against web-based threats. NIS requires a separate set of definition updates.  Version 4.0  Sixteen months after the release of version 2.0, Microsoft skipped version 3.0 and released Microsoft Security Essentials 4.0. A public beta program started on 18 November 2011, when Microsoft sent out invitations to potential participants without announcing a version number. The first beta version was released on 29 November 2011, and the final build on 24 April 2012. Microsoft subsequently initiated a pre-release program that provides volunteers with the latest beta version and accepts feedback.  Version 4.5  On 21 February 2014, version 4.5 entered beta stage. On the same day, Microsoft announced that starting with this version, Windows XP would not be supported. Older versions would continue to receive automatic virus definition updates until 14 July 2015 (afterwards the users of older versions may continue to manually update definitions using Microsoft's site).  Version 4.10  The latest version of 4.10 was released on 29 November 2016. It was version 4.10.209.0 for Windows Vista and Windows 7. This update fixes a bug that was introduced earlier in version 4.10.205.0 which removed the \\"Scan with Microsoft Security Essentials\\" entry from the right-click context menu on files and folders.  Discontinuation  Support for MSE has officially ended for Windows Vista and Windows XP. Older versions still function on those systems and definition updates remain available. Although support for Windows 7 ended on 14 January 2020 and MSE is no longer available to download, Microsoft will continue to update virus definitions for existing users until 2023. Microsoft Security Essentials does not run on Windows 8 and later, which has its own security subsystem, Windows Defender. On 13 September 2011, at the Build conference in Anaheim, California, Microsoft unveiled the developer preview of Windows 8, which had a security component capable of preventing an infected USB flash memory from compromising the system during the boot process. On 15 September, Windows 8 developer's blog confirmed that Windows Defender in Windows 8 would take over the role of virus protection. In an included video, Jason Garms of Microsoft showed how Windows Defender is registered with Action Center as an AV and spyware protection tool, and how it blocks drive-by malware. On 3 March 2012, Softpedia reviewed the consumer preview of Windows 8 and noted the similarity in appearance of Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials 4.0 Beta. According to Softpedia, Windows 8 Setup requires Microsoft Security Essentials to be uninstalled before upgrading from Windows 7.  Licensing  The product's license agreement allows home users to download, install and use it on an unlimited number of computers in their households free of charge, as long as each computer has a legitimately licensed copy of Microsoft Windows. Since October 2010, small businesses have also been allowed to install the product on up to 10 devices, but use in academic institutions and governmental locations is forbidden, as is reverse-engineering, decompiling or disassembling the product or working around its designed limitations. MSE requires no registration or personal information to be submitted during installation; however, the validity of the operating system's license is verified during and after installation using the Windows Genuine Advantage system. If said license is found to be invalid, the software will notify the user and will cease to operate after a period of time.  Reception   Industry response  The announcement and debut of Microsoft Security Essentials was met with mixed responses from the AV industry. Symantec, McAfee and Kaspersky Lab, three competing vendors, claimed it to be inferior to their own software. Jens Meggers, Symantec's vice president of engineering for Norton products, dismissed it as \\"very average ‚Äì nothing outstanding\\". Tom Powledge of Symantec urged his customers to be mindful of what protection they chose, bearing in mind that OneCare offered \\"substandard protection\\" and an \\"inferior user experience\\". Joris Evers, director of worldwide public relations for McAfee stated \\"with OneCare's market share of less than 2%, we understand Microsoft's decision to shift attention to their core business.\\" Justin Priestley of Kaspersky stated that Microsoft \\"continued to hold a very low market share in the consumer market, and we don't expect the exit of OneCare to change the playing field drastically.\\" Avast Software said that it had an ambivalent view towards the product. Vincent Steckler, Avast Software CEO wrote in a blog post \\"MSE is not the silver bullet but it is also not the bad sequel to One Care [sic] that some claim.\\" A representative of AVG Technologies stated, \\"We view this as a positive step for the AV landscape. AVG has believed in the right to free antivirus software for the past eight years.\\" However, AVG raised the issue of distributing the software product and said, \\"Microsoft will have to do more than simply make the product available,\\" adding that integration of Microsoft Security Essentials with Microsoft Windows would be a violation of competition law. McAfee, Sophos and later Trend Micro affirmed that an antitrust lawsuit would surely have followed if Microsoft had bundled the product with Windows. The announcement of Microsoft Security Essentials affected the stocks of AV vendors. On 19 November 2008, after Microsoft announced codename Morro, Symantec and McAfee shares fell 9.44 and 6.62 percent respectively. On 10 June 2009, after announcing an upcoming beta version, Microsoft shares rose 2.1 percent, while Symantec and McAfee fell 0.5 and 1.3 percent respectively. Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets, said that Microsoft Security Essentials would be a \\"long-term competitive threat\\", although near-term impact would be negligible.  Reviews and awards  The public beta version received several reviews, citing its low resource usage, straightforward user interface and price point. Brian Krebs of The Washington Post reported that a quick scan on a Windows 7 computer took about 10 minutes and a full scan about 45 minutes. Ars Technica reviewed it positively, citing its organized interface, low resource usage, and its status as freeware. Nick Mediati of PCWorld noted MSE's \\"clear-cut\\" and \\"cleanly designed\\" tabbed user interface. He did, however, find some of the settings to be cryptic and confusing, defaulting to \\"recommended action\\", with the only explanation of what that action is to be found in the help file. He was also initially confused because the user interface failed to mention that Microsoft Security Essentials automatically updates itself, rather than having to be manually updated via the Update tab; an explanation of this feature was included in the final release. Neil Rubenking of PC Magazine successfully installed the beta version on 12 malware-infected systems and commented on its small installation package (about 7 MB, depending on the operating system) and speedy installation. But the initial virus definition update took between 5 and 15 minutes, and the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space. Rubenking noted that the beta version sets Windows Update into fully automatic mode, although it can be turned off again through Windows Control Panel. Some full scans took more than an hour on infected systems; a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes. An on-demand scan test Rubenking conducted in June 2009 with the beta version found 89 percent of all malware samples: 30 percent of the commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of rootkits, but only half of the scareware samples. The product's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware and blocked the majority of it: 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits were found. Results of AV-TEST antivirus software tests on Microsoft Security Essentials, between June 2010 to June 2013 in three categories: ', ' and . On 7 January 2010, Microsoft Security Essentials won the Best Free Software award from PC Advisor. In December the same year, it secured the Bronze award from AV-Comparatives for proactive detection of 55 percent of new or unknown malware, the Silver award for low false-positives (six occurrences) and the Bronze award for overall performance. In October 2009, AV-TEST conducted a series of trials on the final build of the product in which it detected and caught 98.44 percent of 545,034 computer viruses, computer worms and software Trojan horses as well as 90.95 percent of 14,222 spyware and adware samples. It also detected and eliminated all 25 tested rootkits, generating no false- positives. Between June 2010 to January 2013, AV-TEST tested Microsoft Security Essentials 14 times; in 11 out of 14 cases, MSE secured AV-TEST certification of outperforming AV industry average ratings. Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0 was tested and certified in March 2011. The product achieved a protection score of 2.5 out of 6, a repair score of 3.5 out of 6 and a usability score of 5.5 out of 6. Report details show that although version 2.0 was able to find all malware samples of the WildList (widespread malware), it was not able to stop all Internet-based attacks because it lacks personal firewall and anti-spam capabilities. In an April 2012 test, version 2.1 achieved scores of 3.0, 5.5 and 5.0 for protection, repair and usability. Version 4.0 for Windows 7 SP1 (x64) was tested in June 2012 and achieved scores of 2.5, 5.5 and 5.5 for protection, repair and usability. In October 2012, the product lost its AV-TEST certification when Microsoft Security Essentials 4.1 achieved scores of 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5 for its protection, repair and usability. In AV-TEST's 2011 annual review, Microsoft Security Essentials came last in protection, seventh in repair and fifth in usability. In the 2012 review, it came last in protection and best in usability; however, having lost its certificate, it was not qualified for the usability award. In June 2013, MSE achieved the lowest possible protection score, zero. Microsoft has drastically improved MSE's detection over time and in the very latest tests done by AV-TEST during February 2018 MSE has achieved 100% detection of all malware samples in both the \\"Protection against 0-day malware attacks, inclusive of web and e-mail threats (Real-World Testing)\\" and \\"Detection of widespread and prevalent malware discovered in the last 4 weeks (the AV-TEST reference set)\\" categories, earning it AV-TESTS's \\"Top Product\\" award.  Market share  On 29 September 2010, a year after its initial release, Microsoft announced that MSE had more than 30 million users. The Security Industry Market Share Analysis report of June 2011, published by OPSWAT, describes it as one of the most popular AV products in the world, with 10.66 percent of the global market and 15.68 percent of the North American market. The same report shows Microsoft as the number one AV vendor in North America with 17.07 percent market share, and the number four AV vendor worldwide. John Dunn of PCWorld, who analyzed the report, noted that the tendency to use free AV software is something new: \\"After all, free antivirus suites have been around for years but have tended to be seen as the poor relations to paid software.\\" He named Microsoft Security Essentials as an influence on PC users to adopt free AV software. A September 2011 OPSWAT report found that MSE had further increased its market share to become the second most popular AV product in the world, and remained the most popular in North America. OPSWAT reported in March 2012 that the product had maintained its position, and that Microsoft's market share had improved by 2 percent worldwide and 3 percent in North America. Seth Rosenblatt of CNET News commented on how the product's share rose from 7.27 in 2010 to 10.08 in 2012, stating that \\"use of the lightweight security suite exploded last year\\".  Impersonation by malware  The popularity of Microsoft Security Essentials has led to the appearance of malware abusing its name. In February 2010, a rogue security package calling itself \\"Security Essentials 2010\\" appeared on the internet. Designated TrojanDownloader:Win32/Fakeinit by Microsoft, it bears no visual resemblance to the Microsoft product. It reappeared in November 2010, this time calling itself \\"Security Essentials 2011\\". A more dangerous rogue software appeared in August 2010. Designated Rogue:Win32/FakePAV or Unknown Win32/Trojan, it closely resembles Microsoft Security Essentials and uses sophisticated social engineering to deceive users and infect their systems, under the guise of five different fictional anti-malware products. It also terminates and prevents the launch of 156 different programs, including Registry Editor, Windows Command Prompt, Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Google Chrome.

Self and Identity, 5(4), 289-354 Self-affirmation theory contends that if individuals reflect on values that are personally relevant to them, they are less likely to experience distress and react defensively when confronted with information that contradicts or threatens their sense of self. Experimental investigations of self-affirmation theory suggest that self-affirmation can help individuals cope with threat or stress and that it might be beneficial for improving academic performance, health, and reducing defensiveness.Cohen, G. L., & Sherman, D. K. (2014). The psychology of change: Self-affirmation and social psychological intervention. Annual Review of Psychology, 65, 333-371 Overview There are four main principles of self-affirmation theory. People try to protect their self- integrity Self-affirmation theory proposes that individuals are driven to protect their self-integrity. According to self-affirmation theory, self- integrity is one's concept of oneself as a good, moral person, who acts in ways that are in accord with cultural and social norms. Steele purported that the self is made up of different domains: roles, values, and belief systems. Roles include responsibilities a person has, such as being a parent, friend, student, or professional. Values are aspirations people live in accordance to, including things like living healthfully and treating others with respect. Belief systems include the ideologies to which a person ascribes, such as religious or political beliefs. Self-integrity can take many forms. For example, self-integrity can take the form of being independent, intelligent, a helpful member of a society, part of a family, and/or part of a group. Threats against a person's self-integrity are events or messages that imply an individual is not good or adequate in a personally relevant domain. Self- affirmation theory suggests that when individuals face threat to one of these domains, they are motivated to maintain a positive global image of themselves. Drives to protect the sense of self are often defensive Self-affirmation theory purports that when individuals are faced with information that threatens their self-integrity, the response to this information is often defensive in nature. Defensive reactions attempt to minimize the threat in order to preserve the sense of self. Examples of defensive reactions include denial, avoiding the threat, and changing one's appraisal of the event in order to make it less threatening. Self-integrity is flexible Instead of having one self-concept (e.g., I am a good parent), self-affirmation theory posits that individuals flexibly define who they are using various roles (e.g., I am a good parent, child, and worker). Having a flexible sense of self allows individual to offset weaknesses in one domain, by highlighting the strengths in another domain. That is, if someone perceives threat to one domain, he or she can accommodate this threat by upholding a value in another domain. Self-affirmations can come from many sources. Having a flexible self- concept allows people to adapt in the face of threat. Actions that promote one's values can reduce perceived threat It is theorized that engaging in activities that promote the values, beliefs, and roles that are central to an individual's identity can promote self-integrity. Promoting one's values can affirm the individual and reduce the perceived threat. Engaging in such actions when facing threat serves to remind individuals of the broad, principal values by which they define themselves and their lives. This change in perspective shifts attention away from the threat in one domain of the self toward a larger context of who they are. It is thought that when people operate from this broader perspective, they react less defensively to the threat, which allows them to act more effectively. Self-Affirmations can occur by both reflecting on a personally relevant value, belief, or role, as well as engaging in an activity that might evoke a personally relevant value, such as spending time with family if that is personally relevant. Taken together, the four principles suggest that when confronted with information that threatens self-concept, the person experiences distress and is subsequently motivated to self-defense. However, the defensive reaction can impede more adaptive ways to solve the problem (like engaging in problem-solving or changing unhealthy behaviors). It is thought that affirming an important value unrelated to the threat helps individuals to shift their perspective to their broader life context. Having a broad viewpoint diminishes the perceived threat, allowing individuals to act less defensively and more effectively. Paradigms used to study self-affirmation theory In laboratory experiments, psychologists induce self-affirmation in participants in order to investigate the influence of self-affirmation on individuals' well-being. There are two chief methods used to self-affirm participants in experimental studies. Values essay One of the most common ways to induce self-affirmation is to have participants write about a personally relevant value. In order to do this, participants rank a list of values from most important to least important to them. The list typically includes the following value domains: aesthetics, business, art/music/theater, social life/relationships, science/pursuit of knowledge, religion/morality, and government/politics. Participants then write about the value they ranked as most important and how it is meaningful to them for 10 minutes. Values list The Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Values ScaleAllport, G. W., Vernon, P. E., & Lindzey, G. E. (1960). Study of values: A scale for measuring the dominant interests in personality. Houghton Mifflin is another measures that is administered to participants to induce self-affirmation in the laboratory. Participants choose one of two answers after reading a statement about a value. An example item from the religion scale would be \\"The more important study for mankind is (a) mathematics (b) theology\\".Hunt, R. A. (1968). The interpretation of the religious scale of the Allport-Vernon- Lindzey study of values. Journal for the scientific study of religion, 65-77 This allows researchers to see where an individual's personal interests and values lie. It is thought that answering questions about a value domain that they find important will make that value more salient to them, resulting in self-affirmation. There are six different value domains on the Allport-Vernon- Lindzey Values scale: religion, theoretical, aesthetic, political, social, and economic. Empirical support Extant empirical research demonstrates that self-affirmations can be beneficial in reducing individuals' stress response as well as their defensiveness toward threats. Buffering against stress In one study investigating the effects of self-affirmation on stress response, undergraduate participants completed the Trier social stress test, a standardized laboratory paradigm used to induce stress in participants. In the Trier Social Stress task, participants are asked to give a short speech in front of a panel of judges who do not give any comments or positive feedback to the participant. Following the speech, participants must complete a mental arithmetic task, in which they count backwards from 2,083 in increments of 13 while being told by the judges to go faster. Prior to completing the Trier Social Stress Task, half of the participants completed a variation of values list self-affirmation task. Participants who completed the values list had significantly lower stress response than individuals in the control condition, as indicated by a lower cortisol response in affirmed participants compared to participants who did not complete the self-affirmation condition.Creswell, J. D., Welch, W. T., Taylor, S. E., Sherman, D. K., Gruenewald, T. L., & Mann, T. (2005). Affirmation of personal values buffers neuroendocrine and psychological stress responses. Psychological Science, 16(11), 846-851 In a different experiment, undergraduate students completed difficult problem solving puzzles in the presence of an evaluator. Participants also reported how much chronic stress they endured over the past month. Prior to completing the problem-solving puzzles half of the participants completed a values essay self-affirmation task. For the individuals who did not complete the self- affirmation task, low-stress participants performed significantly better than high-stress participants. For individuals in the self-affirmation condition, high-stress individuals performed equally as well as low-stress individuals. Findings suggest that self-affirmation buffered against the negative effects of stress on problem-solving performance.Creswell, J. D., Dutcher, J. M., Klein, W. M., Harris, P. R., & Levine, J. M. (2013). Self-affirmation improves problem-solving under stress. PLoS ONE, 8(5), e62593 For another experiment, undergraduates were recruited to participate in a research study two weeks prior to completing a mid-term exam. All participants collected urine samples for 24 hours two weeks prior to their midterm (baseline) as well as for the 24 hours prior to their midterm examination so levels their catecholamine levels could be measured. Catecholamine levels are thought to be high when individuals are experiencing higher stress.James, G. D., Crews, D. E., & Pearson, J. (1989). Catecholamines and stress. Human population biology: a transdisciplinary science, 280-95 Half of participants completed two values essays in the two weeks leading up to their midterm examination. Participants who did not complete the self-affirmation condition demonstrated increased catecholamine response from baseline to their midterm exam. However, participants who completed the two values essays did not show an increase in catecholamine levels from baseline to their midterm.Sherman, D. K., Bunyan, D. P., Creswell, J. D., & Jaremka, L. M. (2009). Psychological vulnerability and stress: the effects of self-affirmation on sympathetic nervous system responses to naturalistic stressors. Health Psychology, 28(5), 554 Preliminary research results suggest that self-affirmation can protect against the negative consequences of stress. More research is needed to understand how self-affirmations decrease stress responses. Reducing defensiveness Results from studies provide support for the idea that when individuals complete an activity that affirms their self-integrity they are less defensive and more accepting of information that is potentially threatening. However, more research is needed to better understand why people are more open-minded after they have completed an affirmation task. Applications Education Studies have examined the effects of self-affirmation on the academic performance of historically marginalized groups such as African American and Latino American students, who face a multitude of daily threats in the school environment.Steele CM. 2010. Whistling Vivaldi and Other Clues to How Stereotypes Affect Us. New York: Norton Seventh grade students took part in a two-year study. Half of the students completed a values essay about their most important value approximately seven to eight times over the course of two academic years, while the other half wrote a values essay about why their least important value might be of value to someone else. The study tracked the students' grades for three years. Ethnic minority students in the self-affirmation condition received higher grade point averages than the ethnic minority students who wrote about why their least important value might be important to someone else. There was no effect of self-affirmation in white students. Findings suggest that for students who face daily, repeated stressors at school, self-affirmation buffers against worsening school performance.Cohen, G. L., Garcia, J., Apfel, N., & Master, A. (2006). Reducing the racial achievement gap: A social-psychological intervention. Science, 313(5791), 1307-1310Cohen, G. L., Garcia, J., Purdie-Vaughns, V., Apfel, N., & Brzustoski, P. (2009). Recursive processes in self-affirmation: Intervening to close the minority achievement gap. science, 324(5925), 400-403 Similarly, values affirmation decreased the achievement gap for college students from low socioeconomic statusBowen NK, Wegmann KM, Webber KC. 2013.

Journal of Education Psychology 105:427‚Äì35 and for women in introductory physics courses.Miyake A, Kost-Smith LE, Finkelstein ND, Pollock SJ, Cohen GL, Ito TA. 2010. Reducing the gender achievement gap in college science: a classroom study of values affirmation. Science 330:1234‚Äì37 These findings suggest that self-affirmation can have a buffering effect on academic achievement for groups who face the most threat. Health Women concerned with their weight were recruited for a study. Concern with weight has similar effects of stress in that it can cause psychological distress, poor eating, and weight gain.Haines J, Neumark-Sztainer D, Wall M, Story M. 2007. Personal, behavioral, and environmental risk and protective factors for adolescent overweight. Obesity 15:2748‚Äì60 Half of the women completed a values essay. Self-affirmed participants had lost more weight, had lower body mass index, and smaller waist circumference than non-affirmed women.Logel C, Cohen GL. 2012. The role of the self in physical health. Psychological Science. 23:53‚Äì55 Patients with end stage renal disease participated in a study assessing the effects of self-affirmation on adherence to phosphate binders that facilitate control of phosphate levels. Poor phosphate control in this population can be dangerous and life-threatening. There was a significant improvement in serum phosphate levels for the affirmed patients compared to the non-affirmed patients, suggesting better adherence to phosphate binders.Wileman, V., Farrington, K., Chilcot, J., Norton, S., Wellsted, D. M., Almond, M. K., ... & Armitage, C. J. (2014). Evidence That Self-Affirmation Improves Phosphate Control in Hemodialysis Patients: A Pilot Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial. Annals of Behavioral Medicine, 1-7 Factors that influence the effectiveness of self-affirmations Culture Individualist and collectivist cultures place different levels of importance on belonging to in-groups, and it is thought that this may vary the effects of self-affirmation. One study investigated the effects of self-affirmation on reducing cognitive dissonance. This study found that self-affirmed participants from individualist cultures saw reductions in cognitive dissonance, whereas self-affirmed participants from collectivist cultures did not experience a reduction in cognitive dissonance.Heine, S. J., & Lehman, D. R. (1997). Culture, dissonance, and self-affirmation. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 23, 389-400 Another study examined the effect on individuals from individualist and collectivist backgrounds of writing a values essay about a value that was important to the participant compared to a value that was important to the participant's family. The authors found reduced cognitive dissonance for participants from collectivist cultures who wrote about values important to them and their families, and found reduced cognitive dissonance for participants from individualist cultures who wrote about a value important to just them.Hoshino-Browne, E., Zanna, A. S., Spencer, S. J., & Zanna, M. P. (2004). Investigating attitudes cross-culturally: A case of cognitive dissonance among East Asians and North Americans. In G. Haddock & G. R. Maio (Eds.), Contemporary perspectives on the psychology of attitudes (pp. 375-397). New York: Psychology Press Importance of the threatened domain Benefits from self-affirmation are thought to primarily occur when the perceived threat is in an area of importance to the individual. For example, in the experiment detailed above in which coffee drinkers read an article about caffeine consumption and increased risk of breast cancer, self- affirmation only reduced defensiveness in individuals who were heavy coffee drinkers and not in occasional coffee drinkers.Sherman, D. A., Nelson, L. D., & Steele, C. M. (2000). Do messages about health risks threaten the self? Increasing the acceptance of threatening health messages via self-affirmation. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 26(9), 1046-1058 Because an article on the risks associated with caffeine consumption might not pose the same threat to occasional coffee drinkers as to heavy coffee drinkers, self- affirmation likely does not provide the same benefit for occasional coffee drinkers. Thus, the importance of the threatened domain to one's self- integrity is thought to influence the effectiveness of self-affirmations. Factors underlying the effects of self-affirmation theory Research has not yet identified the underlying mechanisms of how self-affirmation buffers against stress and reduces defensiveness. However, it is believed that there is not just one factor responsible for the effects of self-affirmation, but rather many. To date, increasing positive emotions and self-esteem have been investigated as mechanisms of self-affirmation, but the findings are mixed. Some studies have found that positive mood brings about similar reductions in defensiveness as self-affirmations.Koole, S. L., Smeets, K., Van Knippenberg, A., & Dijksterhuis, A. (1999). The cessation of rumination through self- affirmation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 77(1), 111Raghunathan, R., & Trope, Y. (2002). Walking the tightrope between feeling good and being accurate: mood as a resource in processing persuasive messages. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83(3), 510 In contrast, several studies fail to detect any effect of self-affirmation on mood, suggesting self-affirmation does not operate via increases in positive mood.Steele, C. M., Spencer, S. J., & Lynch, M. (1993). Self-image resilience and dissonance: the role of affirmational resources. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64(6), 885 Similarly, results on the effects of self-affirmation on self-esteem are also mixed. Some studies have observed increases in self- esteem following self-affirmation,Fein, S., & Spencer, S. J. (1997). Prejudice as self-image maintenance: Affirming the self through derogating others. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 73(1), 31 whereas other have found no effect on self-esteem.Schmeichel, B. J., & Martens, A. (2005). Self- affirmation and mortality salience: Affirming values reduces worldview defense and death-thought accessibility. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 31(5), 658-667 More research is needed to better understand how self- affirmation can provide benefit to individuals.

A Republican, he was a member of the Oklahoma Senate from 2004 to 2011. For the 52nd Oklahoma Legislature, Lamb's fellow Republican state senators elected him as their Majority Floor Leader. As Majority Leader, Lamb was the second highest ranking state senator, behind then-Senate President pro tempore Glenn Coffee. On July 1, 2009, Lamb filed to run for Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 elections to succeed outgoing lieutenant governor Jari Askins, who stepped down to run for Governor of Oklahoma. Lamb ran for governor in the 2018 Oklahoma Gubernatorial Election, placing in third in the primary to former Oklahoma City mayor Mick Cornett and Tulsa businessman Kevin Stitt, who became the eventual GOP nominee and governor-elect. On June 2, 2019, Lamb announced that he would become a panelist of Flash Point, a locally-produced Sunday morning political talk show on NBC affiliate KFOR-TV in Oklahoma City, effective at the start of the program's June 16 broadcast. He took over the conservative panelist seat being vacated by former Oklahoma City mayor Kirk Humphreys. Early life and education Lamb is the son of Norman Lamb, a former Oklahoma state senator and the former Oklahoma Secretary of Veterans Affairs under Governor Brad Henry. Lamb was raised in Enid, Oklahoma, and graduated from Enid High School.Barron, Robert, \\"Lamb:Oklahoma poised for great things\\", Enid News & Eagle, June 13, 2011 Lamb attended Louisiana Tech University, where he was member of the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football team. After two years at La. Tech, he transferred to Oklahoma State University where he received his bachelor's degree. Todd also received his Juris Doctor from Oklahoma City University School of Law in 2005.  Career  In 1993, he joined Frank Keating's campaign for Governor of Oklahoma, and was subsequently appointed to the Governor's staff following the November 1994 election. He resigned from the Governor's staff in order to become a special agent with the United States Secret Service in 1998, where he conducted numerous criminal investigations relating to counterfeiting, bank fraud, identity theft, and threats against the president of the United States. During the 2000 presidential election campaign, he served as a site supervisor for George W. Bush's campaign. In 2001, he was appointed to the national Joint Terrorism Task Force, and following the September 11 attacks, was assigned to assist in the investigation of the attacks. Oklahoma Senate Lamb was a member of the Oklahoma Senate from 2004 to 2011, representing the 47th Senate District (which includes part of Oklahoma City as well as Edmond). He faced no opposition in the 2008 election. In August 2009, introduced a bill requiring doctors to perform ultrasounds and offer women information about the tests before performing abortions. The bill was struck down. As majority floor leader, Lamb was ex officio member of all committees. Lieutenant Governor Lamb in 2011 On July 1, 2009, Lamb filed to run for the office of Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma in the 2010 elections. Senator Lamb made his announcement in late August 2009. As part of the announcement, Senator Lamb held events in Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Enid, and Lawton. Lamb faced four Republican primary election opponents in John A. Wright (R-Broken Arrow), a member of the Oklahoma State House, Bill Crozier (a former Republican candidate for Superintendent of Public Instruction), Bernie Adler (an Oklahoma City real estate investor), and Paul Nosak (a tree removal service owner from Oklahoma City), and won the primary election with over 66% of the votes cast, thus avoiding a runoff. In the general election, Lamb faced Democrat Kenneth Corn and independent candidate Richard Prawdzienski and won with over 64% of the votes cast. During his tenure, Lamb served in the cabinet of Mary Fallin as Small Business Advocate. He resigned from that position on February 16, 2017, due to his opposition to proposed tax increases. 2018 gubernatorial campaign Lamb ran in the Republican primary for Governor of Oklahoma in the 2018 election. He lost the primary election on June 26 to Mick Cornett, former mayor of Oklahoma City, and businessman Kevin Stitt. Stitt won the runoff and later defeated former attorney general Drew Edmondson in the November general election.

After experiments with monochrome photography, he adopted the Lumi√®re brothers' Autochrome system after it went on sale in June 1907. In 1911, Courtellemont opened the \\"Palais de l'autochromie\\" at 167 rue Montmartre in Paris, which comprised an exhibition hall, studio, laboratory, and lecture hall with a seating capacity of 250. It was in this hall that Courtellemont would project his autochromes of the Orient. Images collected in Turkey, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, Spain, India, Morocco and China formed the basis for his popular illustrated lectures, which he illustrated with lantern slides. With the outbreak of World War I, Courtellemont returned to his home province to record the war. He continued to show his photographs of the war at the \\"Palais\\", particularly the Marne battlefields. His lectures proved to be so popular that Courtellemont issued a twelve-part series of the First Battle of the Marne, later bound in book form as Les champs de bataille de la Marne; and later a four-part series entitled Les champs de bataille de Verdun about the Battle of Verdun. These are the first books ever published in color on war. Between 1923 and 1925 he wrote a three-volume work entitled La Civilisation ‚Äì Histoire sociale de l'humanit√©, illustrated with his photographs. After the war, Courtellemont began working for an American publication. He eventually became a photographer for National Geographic. He was a lifelong friend of the novelist, Orientalist and photographer Pierre Loti. While over 5,500 Gervais-Courtellemont autochromes survive in various institutional collections, including the Mus√©e Albert-Kahn in Boulogne-Billancourt and the in central Paris, his work in private hands is quite rare and sought after. His German contemporary, who made autochromes of German troops during World War 1, was Hans Hildenbrand. Courtellemont died in 1931.  Style  Courtellemont's work displays a tight sense of composition, an acute awareness of the interplay of light on color, and a haunting familiarity of symbolism. Landscapes are carefully composed, with due attention to lighting and placement within the picture frame. He used symbols such as the lonely cross and the charred tree for dramatic effect.

The team improved upon their previous output of 6‚Äì9‚Äì1, winning seven games.1985 Philadelphia Eagles This was the fourth consecutive season in which the team failed to qualify for the playoffs. Philadelphia was in position to earn a wild-card berth with a 6‚Äì5 record by late November, but a four-game losing streak, which included a home loss to the Minnesota Vikings in which the Eagles squandered a 23-0 fourth quarter lead, foiled their playoff hopes. That losing streak also cost head coach Marion Campbell his job before the season finale at Minnesota. Under interim coach Fred Bruney, the Eagles pulled off a 37‚Äì35 victory at the Metrodome to finish the season on an up note. Two bright spots emerged at the quarterback position as Ron Jaworski returned from the broken leg suffered at the end of the 1984 season, and performed well enough (3,450 passing yards, 17 touchdowns) to be considered for comeback player of the year, though no award was given out. In addition, second-round draft pick Randall Cunningham made his debut on September 22 at Washington and earned his first career victory at RFK Stadium. On November 10, at Veterans Stadium, Jaworski combined with wide receiver Mike Quick for a club-record 99-yard touchdown pass in overtime to beat the Atlanta Falcons, 23‚Äì17.

It was modeled on the Laudes Mediolanensis civitatis (c.738), which is preserved today only in a Veronese manuscript. The anonymous Versus have been ascribed to Pacificus, archdeacon at Verona from 803 until his death in 846, but this ascription is unlikely.Peter Godman (1985), Latin Poetry of the Carolingian Renaissance (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press), 29-31 (analysis), 180-187 (poem, with translation). The poem consists of thirty-three strophes and three verses.  Context and content  Contextually, the Versus were composed in a city that had undergone a recent ecclesiastical reform--under its bishops Eginus (c.780) and Ratold (799)--and the establishment of an abbey and basilica dedicated to the patron Saint Zeno outside the walls of the city and the establishment of the orthodox Cathedral of Maria Matricolare within the walls. In 799 Pippin of Italy had moved his royal court from Pavia to Verona.Pippin receives high praise in lines 94-96\\\\. The De Pippini regis Victoria Avarica (c.796) was also composed at Verona to praise Pippin around this same time. At the time Verona possessed newly rebuilt walls, studded with forty regular towers and eighth tall ones at the gates, referred to in lines 4-6\\\\. The poet of the Versus, probably a monk, stresses not only the glory of Verona's Christian present, but departs from his model, the Versum, to praise its pagan past: fana, tempora, constructa a deorum nomina (\\"its shrines and temples were built and dedicated to the gods\\", line 13). The monuments specifically referred to are the Roman amphitheatre and the Ponte di Pietra. The Versus can form a valuable source for early medieval Verona, since the city was partially destroyed by the earthquake of 3 January 1117. In lines 22-24, the Veronese poet does lament the evil of the city's pagan founders. Thereafter the Versus is dedicated to the thirty-five saints, forty martyrs, and twelve apostles associated with Verona.This portion of the poem takes the form of a pilgrim's itinerary. The list of Veronese bishops after line 40 does not appear to be based on the earlier Sermo de Vita S. Zenonis or Vita Zenonis, but is similar to a list of bishops embroidered on the Velo di Classe of bishop Anno (c.760). The return of the relics of Firmus and Rusticus, which had first been taken to Africa, then to Capodistria and finally to Trieste, before bishop Anno brought them back around 760 and re-buried them in their original sarcophagus, inspired reference to these saints.The Translatio sancti Firmi et Rustici which recounts this story was only written down in the tenth century. The anonymous poet, in competition with Milan, lists some Milanese saints (lines 63-64) and some cities which praise Verona, \\"the gateway to the bounds of Liguria\\": Aquileia, Mantua, Brescia, Pavia, Rome, and Ravenna; Milan is notably omitted.  Linguistic analysis  The anonymous poet was inventive in his use of language. He praises Verona in line 2 for its pre-eminence among the cities in partibus Venetiarum, ut docet Isidorus, \\"in the area of the Veneto, as Isidore teaches.\\" In fact, Isidore teaches no such thing, and the plural form Venetiarum is an invention of the poet. In general, the poet's non-classical usages contrast with his evident learnedness. His verses are marked by \\"syllabic irregularities\\" among other anomalies. The Versus are sometimes classified as \\"popular\\" poetry, on the basis of their vulgarisms.These include egredere for egredi and sternatum for stratum. This generally assumes that the poet was writing in an uneducated manner, but this is unsatisfactory in the case of the Veronese writer, who often deliberately moves away (grammatically) from his source. Rather, the poet is constructing a Latin more accessible to his clerical audience, based on their spoken Latin. There is a parallel between this and the similar vulgarising of Paulinus II of Aquileia.

She told him that \\"this [Israeli-Palestinian] conflict isn't territorial... This is a religious battle led by Islam. We can't ignore this basic truth.\\" In December 2011, Hotovely gained media attention by sitting at the front of a Mehadrin bus used by some Haredim, where women are asked to sit at the back of the bus. She was re-elected in the 2013 elections, after winning fifteenth place on the joint Likud-Yisrael Beiteinu list, and was appointed Deputy Minister of Transportation and Road Safety in the new government. She was also appointed Deputy Minister of Minister of Science and Technology in December 2014, after Yaakov Peri quit as the minister. Following the 2015 elections, in which she was re-elected in twentieth place on the Likud list, she was appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs in the new government. In July 2017, following the declaration of Hebron as a Palestinian World Heritage Site by UNESCO, Hotovely addressed the Arab members of Knesset in a speech, holding up the Tanakh in one hand and A History of the Palestinian People in the other, saying: \\"I recommend to UNESCO and to the Arab Knesset members to read these two books, the Bible which tells the story of the Jewish people, and Assaf Voll's new best-seller, A History of the Palestinian People: From Ancient Times to the Modern Era.

She was later sworn in as Minister of Settlement Affairs in the new government in May 2020. In July 2020, she resigned from the Knesset under the Norwegian Law, and was replaced by Ariel Kellner. In August 2020, she resigned as Minister of Settlement Affairs. Views and opinions Hotovely rejects Palestinian statehood aspirations, supporting a Greater Israel spanning over the entire land of current Israel, along with the Palestinian territories. She later reiterated her position in a speech to Israeli diplomats on 22 May 2015, rejecting criticism from the international community regarding the West Bank settlement policies and saying that Israel has tried too hard to appease the world, and must stand up for itself. She said: \\"We need to return to the basic truth of our rights to this country.\\" She added: \\"This land is ours. All of it is ours. We did not come here to apologise for that.\\" She has also stated that she will make every effort to achieve global recognition for West Bank settlements, as well as asserting that Israel owes no apologies for its policies in the Holy Land towards the Palestinians. She justified her position as she referenced religious texts to back her belief that Judea and Samaria belongs to the Jewish people. In October 2015, in an interview with the Knesset Channel, Hotovely said: \\"It's my dream to see the Israeli flag flying on the Temple Mount.\\" She added: \\"I think it's the center of Israeli sovereignty, the capital of Israel, the holiest place for the Jewish people\\", despite the government's insistence that it has no intention of changing the status quo at the site. Alongside fellow politician Avraham Michaeli, Tzipi Hotovely is one of the most prominent Georgian Jews in Israel, and takes part in events to celebrate the Georgian-Jewish community.A gala evening in Tel Aviv 23-12-2012 In the Knesset, she sponsored a national authority bill to preserve and recognise the heritage of Georgian Jews.◊î◊¶◊¢◊™ ◊ó◊ï◊ß ◊î◊®◊©◊ï◊™ ◊î◊ú◊ê◊ï◊û◊ô◊™ ◊ú◊û◊ï◊®◊©◊™ ◊ô◊î◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊í◊ô◊ê◊ï◊®◊í◊ô◊î (◊í◊®◊ï◊ñ◊ô◊î), ◊î◊™◊©◊°\\"◊ò In a 22 November 2017 interview with Israel's I24news, Hotovely said that most American Jews \\"don't understand the complexities of the region\\", [the Middle East], because they \\"never send their children to fight for their country. Most of the Jews don't have children serving as soldiers.\\". Her statement came as she was addressing increased tensions between Israel and U.S. Jewry. In 2019, Hotovely criticised the Board of Deputies of British Jews. Following the publication of the Board's Jewish Manifesto, which noted support for a two-state solution, she complained that they had not consulted ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs Ministry of Foreign Affairs, our ambassador, any other political authority‚Äù before publication; also stating \\"an organization that supports the establishment of a Palestinian state is working against Israeli interests\\". Criticism Several senior members of the British Jewish community, who are affiliated with the Labor Party and other left-wing groups, criticized her appointment as Ambassador of Israel to the United Kingdom, mainly because of her \\"ultra-right-wing\\" opinions - including Melanie Phillips, Jenni Frazer, Laura Janner-Klausner, and Jeremy Beecham, Baron Beecham, who stated: \\"The appointment of an ultra-right-wing ambassador, while typical of the present government of Israel, will do nothing to win friends in the UK ‚Äì or indeed any other reasonable country.\\" Personal life On 27 May 2013, Hotovely married Or Alon, a lawyer, in a wedding that had 2,500 guests.

Early life Mridula Sinha was born on 27 November 1942 in the village of Chhapra Dharampur Yadu in Muzaffarpur district in Mithila region of Bihar state in India. Her father was Babu Chhabile Singh and her mother was Anupa Devi. She attended the local school in Chhapra and later studied at Balika Vidyapeeth, a residential school for girls in Lakhisarai district. Shortly before she completed her bachelor's degree, Mridula's parents arranged for her to marry Ram Kripal Sinha, who at that time a college lecturer based in Muzaffarpur town, Bihar. After marriage, Mridula continued her studies and took a post-graduate degree in Psychology. She then took a job as a lecturer in the Dr. S.K. Sinha Women's College in Motihari. Shortly afterwards, her husband received his doctorate degree. She left the job and started a school in Muzaffarpur where her husband was working in a college. Career Meanwhile, with encouragement from her husband, Mridula experimented with the short story format. She was interested in cultural matters and village traditions. She wrote short stories on these topics and on folk tales that she gathered from the villages where she and her husband worked. Many of these stories were published in Hindi language magazines and were later compiled into a two-volume anthology named Bihar ki lok-kathayen (\\"folk-tales of Bihar\\"). She also wrote several novels and a biography of Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia titled Ek Thi Rani Aisi Bhi. A film of the same name was later made based on this book. Mridula initially helped her husband in reaching out to the women of the constituency during his campaigns for election to the district committee. She found that with her knowledge of local tradition and cultural nuances, she had a strong connect with the people, especially women. She developed a very strong interest and commitment for social welfare, although she had no interest in electoral politics and never contested any election. She was named Chairperson of Central Social Welfare Board. Political career At this time, her husband was a cabinet minister in the Bihar state government. She was until August 2014 a member of the national executive of Bharatiya Janata Party. During the BJP's campaign for 2014 general elections, she was in-charge of the BJP Mahila Morcha (women's wing). On 25 August 2014, she was appointed as the Governor of Goa. Sinha was also appointed as an ambassador for the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi. During her tenure as Governor of Goa, she also adopted a cow and a calf at the Raj Bhavan for the purpose of daily worship.

They lived along the Shilka River in modern Zabaykalsky Krai of Russia.History of Mongolia, Volume II, 2003 After the Mongol conquest in the 13th century many Jalairs spread over Central Asia and the Middle East. Jalairs are one of the founding tribes of Mongolia's largest ethnic group Khalkha. Smaller clans named Jalayir are also found among the Inner Mongolians in China. The Jalayirs who stayed in Central Asia under the rules of Genghis Khan's older sons' descendants eventually adopted Turkic language. They are found among the Kazakhs of the Great j√ºz; also they are found among the Uzbeks (especially among Uzbeks of Southern Tajikistan and Afghanistan), Karakalpaks, and the Kyrgyz. The Jalairs who went to Iran and Iraq found the Jalairid Sultanate in 1330, and expanded into Turkey. The state was then taken over by the \\"Black sheep Turkomans\\" or Kara Koyunlu in 1432. Smaller numbers of powerful Jalair families lived in Khorasan, Iran as well as in the Mughal Empire until the 19th century. The current president of Kazakhstan is a Jalair. Ethnic origin theory \\"The term Jalair (~ Yyalair) could be the Mongol version of the Turkic name for the second ruling house of the Uyghur Khaganate: Yaglakar ~ yaƒüla er (\\"anointed man\\" < Turkic ya:ƒü \\"oil\\" + Turkic -la \\"suffix for deriving a denominal verb\\" + Turkic er \\"man, male, husband, warrior\\" or the same but with the Turkic suffix of pertinence, -lV(ƒü); cf. modern Turkish yaƒüla(-mak) \\"to oil, to lubricate; to kiss ass, to suck up,\\" Turkish yaƒülƒ± \\"oily, fatty, greasy,\\" modern Mongolian —ç—Ä [ir] \\"man, male, masculine, husband\\"). Yaglakar (Ch. Ëó•ÁæÖËëõ/ËçØÁΩóËëõ Yaoluoge) was the royal tribe of the Tiele Uighur On-Uigur Toquz OŒ≥uz \\"ten Uighur tribes in the Tokuz-Oguz confederation\\". The first element of the name of the Jalair tribe also might be compared with Turkish yaƒülƒ±k (‚Äúheadscarf, kerchief, shawl‚Äù), Chuvash “´—É–ª”ë–∫ (≈õulƒÉk, ‚Äúshawl worn by a groom‚Äù), etc. Early history Mongol Empire c.1207 The Jalair might be the Chaladi who were recorded in Chinese sources of 910. The Jalairs revolted against the Khitan rule in 1014. Subsequently, they were suppressed by the Khitans in the next year. Then the Jalayirs turned to the Mongol tribe and defeated the Borjigins utterly. But Khaidu of the Borjigin conquered and dispersed them among Mongol tribes around 1060. The Jalair was one of the three core tribes in Khamag Mongol confederation in the 12th century. The Jalairs such as Mukhulai helped Genghis Khan to found his Empire. During the Mongol invasion of Khorazm in 1219-1223, Muqali campaigned in North China as the first prince of the state (guo-wang) and a viceroy. The Jalairs served under Great Khans as steward, chief judge, imperial tutor and advisor. Genghis Khan also gave 1,000 men under Jalair Moqe noyan to his son Chagatai Khan in Turkestan. And a body of the Jalair settled in Golden Horde. Medieval Jalairs When M√∂ngke Khan ordered Hulagu (Alaghu) to conquer the Abbasid caliphate, the Ayyubids in Syria and the Mamluks in Egypt in 1252, the Jalairs prepared strong military contingent. Their commander Kok-Elege participated sieges of Persian and Arab fortresses from 1256‚Äì1261 and the battle against Berke's commander Nogai Khan in 1262. Under Genghis Khan's successors, Muqali's descendants inherited his title and came to be one of the mainstays of Confucian influence in Kublaid Yuan Dynasty (1271‚Äì1368). The Jalairs were close to Great Khans in China and Il-khans in Iran. In Il-khanate, Jalair Buqa revolted against Tekuder Khan and installed Hulagu's grandson Arghun in 1284. But his coup was revealed and executed by his prot√©g√© later. After the death of Qazan Khan (r. 1343-1346), Chagatai Khanate fell under the control of nomadic Turco-Mongol clans: the Jalayir in the north, the Arlat in the west, the Barlas in the centre, the Qaraunas and the Qa'uchin in the south-west and the Dughlats in the east. Meanwhile, Hasan Buzurg established Jalayirid Dynasty and tried to reunite Turco-Mongol states in the name of his puppet khans in Iraq and western Persia of which fell into political chaos after the death of Il-khan Arpa Ke'un in 1336. When Tamerlane ravaged the Jalayirid Dynasty of Ahmad (1383‚Äì1410), Central Asian Jalairs were one of main clans in both Timurid Empire and Moghulistan. The Jalairids in Persia were finally overthrown by Kara Koyunlu Turks in 1432. But the Jalayirs in Central Asia were active for two more centuries. In the 16th century, the Jalairs played important role in Eastern and Central Mongolian politics. They were one of the 14 clans of Khalkha tumen and Dayan Khan's son Gersenj was written in Mongolian chronicles as the prince of Jalayir (Jalaid). Modern Jalairs Mongolia Jalairs are part of the Khalkha people of Mongolia. In the present China, Jalairs are a clan and a banner in the Jirim and Ordos Leagues, and Chahar of Inner Mongolia. Iran Timur brought 400 Jalair families to Khorasan. They live in Kalat-i-nadiri. Until end of the 19th century, Kalat-i- nadiri had its own hereditary chief of Jalayir tribe, who held the fortress as feudatories of Persia.Yate, Khurasan and Sistan, p.157 Under Nader Shah Afshar, Jalayirs rose to power and held important official positions within Persian government and military: *Qasem Ali Khan Jalayir - military commander during reign of Nader Shah Afshar. *Subedar Khan Jalayir - military commander during reign of Nader Shah Afshar. *Zal Khan Jalayir - military commander during reign of Shahrukh Afshar.

He played with many of the world's best-known orchestras. Biography Solomon was born in Cape Town, the youngest of seven children of a family from Lithuania. At the age of six he showed an interest in boogie- woogie and jazz. After winning a musical scholarship, and receiving support from Kendall Taylor, he studied at the University of Cape Town, graduating with distinction in both music and psychology. He continued his studies with Dame Myra Hess, Guido Agosti and Charles Rosen. He won several major piano competitions, including the Harriet Cohen Beethoven Medal.

The primary contractor for the spacecraft was Thoth Technology Inc. The spacecraft would consist of four parts: an apogee kick engine to provide orbital injection for a cruise vehicle that carries the Northern Light lander and the Beaver Rover to a direct rendezvous with Mars using a Hohmann transfer orbit. Atmospheric entry would be achieved by a heat shield, parachute and airbag deployment system. The lander would transfer the rover to the Martian surface. Once deployed on the Martian surface, the lander contacts Earth directly to the 46 m parabolic antenna located at the Algonquin Radio Observatory. The Beaver Rover was proposed to have a maximum range of 1000 metres (0.62 mile) from the landing site. It would have operated under battery, utilizing tools and sensors to investigate surface rocks that may contain the presence of photosynthetic life.  History  The project officially started in 2001, and its project leader was Ben Quine, from York University, Canada. York University has participated in the Canadian Space Program and has designed several space research instruments and applications currently used by NASA, including the meteorological station on board the Phoenix Mars lander.Experiment aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour. York U press release. Retrieved 2008-05-22NASA Phoenix Mission to Mars. York U press release. Retrieved 2008-05-22. Partners in this Mars project were York University, University of Alberta, University of Toronto, University of Waterloo, University of Winnipeg, University of Western Ontario, University of Saskatchewan, University of New Brunswick, McGill University and Simon Fraser University. The mission control for the period after it lands on Mars, would have been headquartered at York University. The cost was estimated at $20 million, or possibly less if another country shares the rocket. The Canadian Space Agency confirmed it knows of the project, but has no involvement in it. In 2014, a crowd sourcing campaign to support the mission was launched on Indiegogo and YouTube in order to raise $1.1 million Canadian dollars for development of the flight hardware,.

Northern Light Indiegogo campaign Scientific goals There are four primary goals for the mission: # Search for life on Mars # Search for water on Mars # Investigate Martian electromagnetic radiation environment and atmospheric properties # Prepare for the international effort of a Mars sample return mission and a human mission to Mars Payload of the Beaver Rover The rover system was required for geological surface exploration and for subsurface imaging. With a mass of approximately 6 kg (13.2 lb), the rover would operate under its own power and have a range of roughly . The rover would be equipped with a visible camera for manoeuvering and surface exploration, as well as a Point Spectrometer and microscope camera for geological survey. A ground-penetrating radar would explore the Martian subsurface and look for water; an active vibrator and receiver would use short, sub-millisecond pulses to conduct an acoustic study of the subsurface. For immediate subsurface exploration, the rover would be equipped with a rock grinding tool. MASSur Seismic Sensor The MASSur Seismic Sensor, developed by the University of Calgary would have provided depth profiles of the Martian surface. Specifically, a seismometer would conduct tests to determine the rigidity and elasticity of the Martian topsoil as well as its rock properties. Sediments, permafrost, and water may all have distinct signatures. This seismic system would use a vibrational source and elastic-wave receivers (accelerometers) on both the lander and on the Beaver Rover. The redundancy of lander and rover apparatus, ensures that some primary science objectives can be met without rover deployment.  Ground Penetrating Radar  The Ground-Penetrating Radar (GPR) would have utilized a 200 MHz radar to provide fine-scale, sub-surface imaging to a depth of 20 m (65 ft) on loose aggregate and up to 100 m (328 ft) on permafrost or ice. The concept design shares several systems with the seismic instruments.  TC Corer  The corer would be capable of drilling up to 10 mm into surface rocks. This tool would be used in conjunction with the Aurora spectrometer and microscope to examine the near-surface composition and to look for biosignatures of near- surface life. The core would have been contributed to the mission from Hong Kong. The flight model instrument has an estimated mass of 350 g. Payload of the Northern Light Lander Aurora Spectrometer The proposed spectrometer has a wavelength coverage of 625 nm to 2500 nm and observes the whole sky. The instrument would measure variations in spectral irradiance which can be utilized to determine aerosol and atmospheric composition including the concentration of carbon dioxide, the major constituent of the Martian atmosphere. It would also carry out angular dependency of radiation influx in the atmosphere. The Aurora instrument has a mass of 450 g. Argus Spectrometer Similar in design to the Argus 1000 spectrometer flown on CanX-2, the radiometer would be the primary equipment of the Northern Light lander making measurements of spectral rock reflectance. The spectrometer has a mass of 240 g. Camera systems The camera systems on the lander would have the capability of narrow and wide field surveys. The narrow field survey would have provided a very high resolution, panoramic view of the landing site. Colour filters would perform some spectral mapping and mineral identification of the surrounding soil; the camera would also perform limited atmospheric and astronomical observations. Colour images of Earth would have been obtained. The wide field survey would provide an overall colour view of the lander's surroundings to help rover deployment and route planning. MASSur Seismic Sensors Similar specifications as those on the Beaver Rover. Environmental sensors Environmental sensors would monitor environmental conditions at the landing site. Various instruments would have measured UV rays, oxidising substances, air pressure, air temperature, dust impact, wind velocity, and ground vibration. These sensors would have a combined mass of 130 g. Flight models were previously developed for Britain's Beagle 2 lander. Tracking The entry system would have been tracked and targeted utilizing a combination of Doppler radar and very long baseline interferometry. This data would processed by a high-resolution orbital model that utilizes high-precision ephemeris to predict spacecraft location and trajectory. Upon launch, tracking would commence at the Algonquin Radio Observatory. After orbital injection, the spacecraft would be contacted periodically to obtain system status and to determine trajectory. As the package reaches the Matrian thermosphere continuous tracking would commence in order to verify mechanism deployment during descent. Landing site The landing site would have been determined from one of three options by crowd sourcing campaign. One option was a dry 'sea', within 5 km of a basin formation.

The TEM was first used extensively for this purpose in the 1980s, especially for identifying the markers of cell differentiation to identify tumours, and in renal disease. Immunolabelling techniques are now generally used instead of the TEM for tumour diagnosis but the technique retains a critical role in the diagnosis of renal disease and a range of other conditions. Specifically, TEM should be used for diagnostic purposes when it: (1) provides useful (complementary) information in the context of a carefully considered differential diagnosis; (2) provides an ‚Äòimproved‚Äô diagnosis that results in better treatment strategies and; (3) is time & cost effective in respect to alternative techniques. For diagnostic purposes solid tissues are prepared for TEM in the same way as other biological tissues, they are fixed in glutaraldehyde and osmium tetroxide then dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin. The epoxy resin block is trimmed and the target tissue is selected using a light microscope by viewing semithin sections stained with toluidine blue. The block is then retrimmed and the specific area for observation is ultrathin sectioned, preferably using a diamond knife. The ultrathin sections are collected on 3mm copper (mesh) grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate to make the contents of the tissue electron dense (and thus visible in the electron microscope).Woods AE, Stirling JW. 2008.

The site covers an area of and is bounded by Park Terrace to the south, the Outer Harbor railway line to the west, Drayton Street to the north and Sixth and Seventh Streets to the east. The Government also acquired the adjoining 5.9-hectare site which had been owned by Origin Energy (known as the Brompton Gasworks site). Currently the overall Bowden development site is 16.3 hectares. The development is expected to be completed by 2020 to 2025. The development is expected to increase the population of Bowden, which was 648 in the 2006 census, to 3,500.  Sustainability initiatives The Bowden development is leading the way with many groundbreaking initiatives including energy reduction through passive and active measures for buildings. Green Star is a world's best practice rating tool from the Green Building Council of Australia covering a broad range of well-tested sustainability issues. Each and every building delivered in the development must achieve a minimum 5 Star Green Star rating including commercial buildings such as Plant 4 Bowden. In 2016, the Bowden development raised the bar and achieved its 6 Star Green Star - Communities accreditation; and with the highest concentration of Green Star homes in Australia, it is one of the most environmentally sustainable communities in the nation. Later in the same year, the Prince's Terraces Adelaide in Bowden became the first residential project to receive 6 Star Green Star design rating from the Green Building Council of Australia, encapsulating innovation and world leadership in sustainable design. History The Clipsal factory in Bowden in the foreground The Bowden site was occupied by Clipsal, a company manufacturing conduit and electrical accessories, in 1936. The opportunity for an urban development on the site grew out of the South Australian Government's plans for eleven transport-oriented developments in the Adelaide metropolitan area, combined with Clipsal's decision that the Bowden site is surplus to company requirements and plan to vacate. The site was originally offered for sale in early 2008 with offers to be received by July 2008. Offers of 75-80 million Australian dollars were expected but not attained due to the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. The South Australian government announced in October 2008 that it would purchase the site. It was revealed in November 2008 the government had agreed to pay A$52.5 million. Timeline 2008‚Äì2010 In late 2008, the State Government acquired a 10.25ha parcel of land owned by Gerard Industries (known as the Clipsal site). In early 2010, the government acquired the adjoining 5.9ha site owned by Origin Energy (known as the Brompton Gasworks site). Both sites are located within the City of Charles Sturt and are directly adjacent to the Adelaide parklands. The aim is to transform the combined sites into an inner-city, higher intensity, mixed use urban village. The final vision developed collaboratively with the community and stakeholders states: ‚ÄúBowden Urban Village is a creative and diverse community, living and working in a high density sustainable urban environment. Its character, parklands connections and integrated urban design will offer a new and distinctive place in Adelaide for residents and visitors.‚Äù The South Australian Government anticipates that the site will be used to develop more than 2,400 residential apartments and terrace homes, in addition to retail outlets and commercial offices around a town centre. The South Australian Government is promoting the plan as an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development. Bowden is served by Bowden railway station, North Adelaide railway station, buses on Hawker Street and Port Road, and the tram from the nearby Adelaide Entertainment Centre on Port Road, Hindmarsh. Prince Charles launched the Prince's Terraces in Bowden 2011‚Äì2015 In April 2011, the plans for the development were approved Adelaide Now. and an information and sales centre opened in March 2012. Following demolition, site cleanup, surveying, planning and approval, remediation and development are underway. Bowden‚Äôs first pedestrian and bicycle-friendly streets ‚Äî Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and part of Gibson Streets ‚Äî opened to the public in May 2013. In 2014, the restaurant Jarmer's Kitchen opened, and the Bowden development's first residents moved in. In 2015, His Royal Highness Prince Charles, Prince of Wales officially launched the construction of Australia's first 6 Star Green Star residential project, the Prince's Terraces Adelaide which is predicted to use 50% less energy and 50% less potable water than a typical urban townhouse, with a carbon footprint also reduced by more than 40% when compared to a standard house. Bowden Town Square opening community celebration 2016-2017 The community celebrated the completion of a major upgrade to the Adelaide Park Lands across the road from Bowden in February 2016 where the Park Terrace Community Garden currently resides. The Bowden development achieved its sustainability milestone with a 6 Star Green Star - Communities rating in October 2016, and hosted its biggest celebration ever to mark the opening of Bowden Town Square consisting Bowden Park, the Plant 4 Bowden retail hub and Plant 3 community hub. In early 2017, 500 new homes were sold.

However, in 2008‚Äì09, he switched to neighbours Athletic Bilbao. Initially thought of as a member of the reserve side, Balenziaga quickly beat competition from veterans Koikili and Javier Casas to become the undisputed first-choice for the vast majority of the campaign, making his first-team debut on 14 September 2008 in a 0‚Äì0 away draw against M√°laga CF ‚Äì another club graduate, Ander Iturraspe, also made his first La Liga appearance in that game.

Bower (June 12, 1936) is an American applied physicist. Immediately after receiving his Ph.D. from The California Institute of Technology in 1973, he worked for over 25 years in many different professions: Engineer, Scientist, Professor at University of California, Davis, and as president and CEO of Device Concept Inc. He also served as the President of Integrated Vertical Modules, which focused on three-dimensional, high-density structures. His most notable contribution, however, is his field-effect device with insulated gates‚Äîalso known as a self-aligned-gate MOSFET (metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor field-effect transistor), or SAGFET. Bower patented this design in 1969 while working at the Hughes Research Laboratories in Malibu, California. He has also published over 80 journals and articles, patented over 28 inventions, and authored chapters in 3 different books. Biography Life and education Robert W. Bower was born in Santa Monica, California, in 1936. He remained in California throughout his life, except for 1954‚Äì1958 when he enlisted in the Air Force. After his service with the Air Force, he enrolled in UC Berkeley and in 1962 earned his A.B. in Physics while working at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory. One year later, he earned his M.S. in Electrical Engineering from Caltech. In 1965, he worked in Malibu, California with Hughes Research Laboratories, which specializes in aerospace and defense operations. He later returned to Caltech and received his Ph.D. in Applied Physics in 1973. Currently, Dr. Bower is Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Davis, where he has been teaching for over 14 years. Primary accomplishments At the Hughes Research Laboratories in the late 1960s, Bower strove to find the ideal element to integrate in all circuits. In 1920, Lilienfeld conceived of the basic design for this idea but had no platform to build or test his device. In the late 1950s, McCaldin and Hornoi devised of the silicon planar process and Kilby and Noyce established an Integrate circuit that could serve as a basic platform for Lilienfeld's design. In 1963, Steven Hofstein and Frederic Heiman compiled the ideas from all previous scientists and were able to describe the fundamental nature of the MOSFET on a silicon planar process platform; however, they lacked one key asset that would power the MOSFET. In 1965, Bower conceived of the self-aligned-gate ion-implanted MOSFET which was the key to advances in integrated circuits. Self-aligned-gate ion-implanted MOSFET The MOSFET (metal‚Äìoxide‚Äìsemiconductor field-effect transistor) is a device that amplifies or switches electronic signals. However, without the self- aligned gate, the MOSFET lacked a proper source to improve the accuracy of the en\\\\9. Patent controversy Bower's invention underwent much controversy when Kerwin, Klein, and Sarace argued that they were the actual inventors of the self-aligned gate transistors. In 1966, Bower and Dill presented the first publication the self-aligned gate transistor at the International Electron Device Meeting in Washington D.C.. That IEDM publication described the self- aligned gate transistor fabricated with both metal and polysilicon as the gate material and using both ion implantation and diffusion to form the source and drains. This was presentation 16.6 of this IEDM meeting. To Bower and to the attorneys who litigated the Bower U.S. 3,472,712 patent it was determined in the courts that his patent covered the general principal of using a gate as mask for both metal and polysilicon gates using ion implantation to establish the source and drain regions. Bower does not acknowledge the statement \\"Although Bower believed he was first in using aluminum as the gate and later developed the device using polysilicon as the gate, he was unable to prove it to the courts and the patent was awarded to Kerwin, Klein, and Sarace (U.S. 3,475,234)\\" is true. Actually it was the Hans G. Dill patent U.S. 3,544,3999, filed on October 26, 1966 that described the formation of the polysilicon gate self-aligned gate FET using diffusion of the source and drain that was disputed by the Kerwin et al. patent, not the Bower patent. It was also determined in a number of court cases that the vast majority of self-aligned gate FETs were made using ion implantation rather than diffusion to introduce the dopants into the source-drain regions. Bower conferred with the attorneys who litigated these cases and they confirmed that the statement \\"The US patent system grants the patent to the first developer of the invention, not the first one to be issued a patent.\\" is not a valid statement of patent law. Other works Aside from his large contributions in the advancement of MOSFET, Robert W. Bower has published over 80 journals and articles, patented over 28 inventions, and authored chapters in 3 different books. He has recently been working with Integrate Vertical Modules to focus on three- dimensional, high density solid structures. Recent patents * R.W. Bower and M.S. Ismail. ALIGNED WAFER BONDING.

After his death, his first-born son Arthur Sendas Filho, took over as the CEO. His son Jo√£o Ant√¥nio Sendas committed suicide in 2003. Sendas was a support of Vasco da Gama. The Governor of Rio de Janeiro state, Sergio Cabral, declared three days of mourning following Sendas' death.

Biography Atsushi Kitagawara was born in Nagano Prefecture, Japan. While studying for a BA in architecture at Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music he won first prize in the Japan Architect International Design Competition. He graduated in 1974 and proceeded to a master's degree at the same institution, participating in an urban design project while attending graduate school. He began working as an architect in 1975, and in 1982 founded his own firm Atsushi Kitagawara Architects, Inc. He was in 2005 appointed Professor at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music. Since beginning work in his twenties Kitagawara has undertaken architectural projects, urban planning, landscape design, furniture and stage design (including \\"One of a Kind\\" for Jiri Kylian, choreographer and artistic director of the Netherlands Dance Theatre). His concepts and methods draw on fields including poetry, music and contemporary arts. He has won a number of awards, including the Architectural Institute of Japan Award in 2002, the first prize in the Innovative Architecture International Award (Italy) in 2006, the Grand-Prix in the Kenneth Brown Architecture Design Award in 2007, the Murano Togo Prize, the AIA Japan Professional Honor Award in 2008, Top Prize of JIA Grand Prix in 2009, and the Japan Art Academy Prize in 2010. As of 2008 he works extensively outside Japan, including from his atelier in Europe. He also teaches at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music and practices along with associates at Atsushi Kitagawara Architects. He is a protagonist of an artistically shaped and expressionistic architectural style, which celebrates the experience of space, without losing sight of the functional requirements. Through numerous award-winning projects, such as the Nakamura Keith Haring Museum, he is constantly exploring new means of construction, composition and usage of materials. He thereby creates complex spatial structures and fa√ßades, which challenge the conventional viewing patterns of the user, whilst never diminishing the human criteria.

It is the percentage of all attempts that leads to pregnancy, with attempts generally referring to menstrual cycles where insemination or any artificial equivalent is used, which may be simple artificial insemination (AI) or AI with additional in vitro fertilization. Definitions There is no universally accepted definition of the term. Thus in IVF pregnancy rates may be based on initiated treatment cycles, cycles that underwent oocyte retrieval, or cycles where an embryo transfer was performed. In terms of outcome, \\"pregnancy\\" may refer to a positive pregnancy test, evidence of a pregnancy with a \\"viable\\" fetus or implantation. Furthermore, pregnancy rates can be influenced in IVF by transferring multiple embryos that may result in multiple births. A strict definition in the IVF setting would refer to the singleton pregnancy rate that determines how many live singletons are born in relation to initiated IVF cycles. Related end-points In some cases, success rates include delivery or presence of a live baby (preferably specified as delivery rate or live birth rate respectively). Fertilization rate In IVF or its derivatives, fertilization rate may be used to measure how many oocytes become fertilized by sperm cells. A fertilization rate of zero in one cycle, where no oocytes become fertilized, is termed a total fertilization failure. Repeated ICSI treatment may be useful or necessary in couples with total fertilization failure. Implantation rate Implantation rate is the percentage of embryos which successfully undergo implantation compared to the number of embryos transferred in a given period. In practice, it is generally calculated as the number of intrauterine gestational sacs observed by transvaginal ultrasonography divided by the number of transferred embryos. As an example, one center in the United States reported an implantation rate in IVF of 37% at a maternal age of less than 35 years, 30% at 35 to 37 years, 22% at 38 to 40 years, and 12% at 41 to 42 years.About the Fertility Lab from Cleveland Clinic. Data from 2012 Successful implantation of the zygote into the uterus is most likely 8 to 10 days after conception. If the zygote has not implanted by day 10, implantation becomes increasingly unlikely in subsequent days. Live birth rate Live birth rate is the percentage of all cycles that lead to live birth, and is the pregnancy rate adjusted for miscarriages and stillbirths. For instance, in 2007, Canadian clinics reported a live birth rate of 27% with in vitro fertilisation. General factors Age and female fertility: Cumulative percentage and average age for women reaching subfertility, sterility, irregular menstruation and menopause. There is a substantial connection between age and female fertility. Menarche, the first menstrual period, usually occurs around 12‚Äì13, although it may happen earlier or later, depending on each girl. After puberty, female fertility increases and then decreases, with advanced maternal age causing an increased risk of female infertility. A 2001 review suggested a paternal age effect on fertility, where older men have decreased pregnancy rates. Pregnancy rate for sexual intercourse fertilization by menstrual cycle day relative to ovulation. Pregnancy rates in ovulation induction, as functions of the size of the leading follicle as measured by transvaginal ultrasonography at days 11 - 13 (bottom scale), as well as the thickness of the endometrial lining (4 different curves). The time with the highest likelihood of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse covers the menstrual cycle time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation.Pages .242,374 in: In a 28‚Äëday cycle with a 14‚Äëday luteal phase, this corresponds to the second and the beginning of the third week. A variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle; these systems are called fertility awareness. There are many fertility testing methods, including urine test kits that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors. Fertility awareness methods that rely on cycle length records alone are called calendar-based methods. Methods that require observation of one or more of the three primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position)Page 52 in: are known as symptoms-based methods. For optimal pregnancy chance, there are recommendations of sexual intercourse every 1 or 2 days, or every 2 or 3 days. Published date: February 2013. Last updated: September 2017 Studies have shown no significant difference between different sex positions and pregnancy rate, as long as it results in ejaculation into the vagina. According to the American Pregnancy Association, the following factors of sexual intercourse may increase pregnancy chances: *The woman raising her hips about 3 to 4 inches in order to allow gravity to assist with drawing the sperm towards the cervix opening and into the uterus, but there no scientific data that confirms any beneficial effect of this practice. *Having sexual intercourse in the morning, by providing the best sperm quality. *Avoiding hot tubs before sex because the high temperature is harmful to sperm. *Avoiding vaginal douching before or after sex because the altered vaginal acidity is harmful to sperm, and washes away the fertility- beneficial cervical mucus. *Avoiding lubricants unless they are sperm- friendly. Pregnancy rate for artificial insemination Generally, pregnancy rate for AI it is 10‚Äì15% per menstrual cycle using ICI,Utrecht CS News Subject: Infertility FAQ (part 4/4) and 15‚Äì20% per cycle for IUI. Pregnancy rate for in vitro fertilization With enhanced technology, the pregnancy rates are substantially higher today than a couple of years ago.

Geography Bodovlje Creek Bodovlje is a clustered village that lies on the right bank of the Poljane Sora River, along both sides of Bodovlje Creek (). Most of the settlement is on the floodplain along the river, but some houses also stand in the narrow valley along the creek. The creek valley is bounded by De≈°na Hill (elevation ) to the east and Saint Peter's Hill (, elevation ) to the southwest. There are fields and meadows in the flat area along the river, and the creek valley and hillsides are forested. Name Bodovlje was attested in written records in 1291 and 1318 as Vondeul (and as Vodobli in 1500). The name is presumably derived from the plural demonym *B«´dovƒæane, created from a place name such as *B«´dovƒæe (selo) (literally, 'B«´d—ä's village'), based on the personal name *B«´d—å or *B«´d—ä.Snoj, Marko. 2009.

History Mass grave Bodovlje is the site of a mass grave from the period immediately after the Second World War. The Bodovlje Mass Grave () is located on a steep forest slope 200 m southeast of the village. It contains the remains of 22 to 24 Home Guard prisoners of war that were taken from the prison at Loka Castle on the night of 29 May 1945, murdered, and buried in a former Partisan bunker. Post‚ÄìWorld War II The Termika factory was established in Bodovlje in 1958. It produced mineral wool and employed about 220 people. The site of the plant was formerly a veneer factory. Church Saint Peter's Church The local church is dedicated to Saint Peter. It dates to the early 16th century, although the nave was vaulted in the Baroque style at a later date. The nave contains remains of frescos from the early 16th century. The sanctuary is also decorated with saints in the lower borders, apostles at window height, and evangelists and angels higher up, all by the painter Jernej of Loka dating to between 1525 and 1540.≈†kofja Loka municipal declaration of local churches as cultural monuments, 23 May 2007 The church altars date to the 18th century.Krajevni leksikon Dravske Banovine. 1937.

On 10 March 1963, the regiment was reorganized as the 252nd Armor Regiment, consisting of 1st and 2nd Battalions as elements of the 30th Infantry Division (concurrently, the former 196th Armor Regiment was reconstituted and reorganized from existing units of the North Carolina Army National Guard as the 196th Cavalry Regiment, hereafter a separate lineage).\\"History and Traditions: North Carolina National Guard.\\" Second Edition, August 1966.

On 1 December 1973, 1st Battalion was reorganized as an element of the 30th Infantry Brigade, while 2nd Battalion was reorganized as a separate armor battalion of the North Carolina Army National Guard, where it was later deactivated. On 1 June 1989, the regiment was withdrawn from the Combat Arms Regimental System and reorganized under the United States Army Regimental System. 1st Battalion, 252nd Armor deployed with the rest of 30th Brigade for a year-long tour of duty to Iraq in February 2004.Pike, John. \\"30th Enhanced Heavy Separate Brigade.\\" Globalsecurity.org.

This was their second deployment as a battalion, but their first deployment as a brigade in whole. Over 4,000 soldiers were deployed and stationed throughout Baghdad. C Company, 1/252 CAB ran over 600 Combat missions during a 10-month period making them the most used unit in the Combat Arms perspective for the 30th Brigade. 2nd Platoon of C Company was hit on two separate occasions with Improvised explosive devices approximately 1 week apart. 3rd Platoon, C Company was ambushed north of FOB Falcon in the Saydiyah district.

Forced to battle for recognition on his own in the examination system, Tr·ª© entered the 1813 examinations and was able to win merely the status of a licentiate.\\" He came up against a lot of obstacles in academic field in which he was really successful only when he reached the age of 42. Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© held a respectable position in military as a General. Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© was a poet contributing to Vietnamese declamation‚Äôs foundation, namely the poem ‚ÄúB√†i ca ng·∫•t ng∆∞·ªüng‚Äù Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© earned respect as a devoted Confucian scholar and elder statesman. While living in a corrupt feudal system, Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© was known to be honest and straightforward. Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© dedicated nearly all his life to his country and the welfare of its citizens. After his retirement, Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© lived the rest of his life in his hometown and gave a hand with the restoration of pagodas and gave lectures in Buddhism‚Äôs belief. He died 7 December 1858. At Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª©‚Äôs funeral came King T·ª± ƒê·ª©c as well as distinguished mourners. Life Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© was born into a poor family. But with diligence, Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© graduated from high school in 1813 and came first in interprovincial Laureate contest in 1819. Then, Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© led a varied life as a mandarin in Nguy·ªÖn Dynasty. He held the highest position as Hai An‚Äôs Minister and Minister of Defence in 1836 (Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province with Hai Duong is Hai An in the past). In 1845, Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© was demoted as a border guard. When he was an officer in charge of farms (a General takes on agriculture owing to being ordered by the King), Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© broke fresh ground to bring farmers 45.990 acres of enriched rice fields. Kim Son and Tien Hai were the most enriched ones. To give credit for his distinguished civil services, the residents set up Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª©‚Äôs shrines. One is now in Tien Hai (founded in 1852) and the other is in Kim Son (founded in 1856). The king gave him valuables such as hundreds of ingots of silver, an agate sculpture of horse, a gong bearing a golden inscription ‚ÄúLao nƒÉng kh·∫£ t∆∞·ªüng‚Äù (the meaning: his credits and devotion to duty deserves rewarding). Because Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© was a righteous, honest and straightforward mandarin, many a dishonest official had an aversion to such individuality of his. Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© was slandered 3 times, however, luckily enough, everything was brought to light and he was completely vindicated then. Furthermore, in the event of Kim Son‚Äôs and Tien Hai‚Äôs bumper crops, the residents invited the 75-year-old mandarin to join the harvest festival as a red-carpet treatment, and dishonest officials vilified him a rebel leader in Kim Son and Tien Hai but then he succeeded in justifying himself to King T·ª± ƒê·ª©c. Understandably, Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© took the honor and dishonor for granted. Life as a poet and activist His poems, which have mostly been written in pictographic script of Vietnamese, show deep feeling. Some findings have shown that Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© had over 1000 poems mainly of Tang prosody and declamation style of Vietnam. The majority of them is now missing. Approximately 150 of his works remain today. What people find remarkable for Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª©‚Äôs poems is the individualism, which is truly of the freedom and the independence. Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© made contributed to the growth of medieval Vietnamese literature as well as the variation of this language on the grounds that his works are mainly composed in pictographic script of Vietnamese. The conception of morality in medieval society is ‚ÄúLap duc- Lap cong- Lap ngon‚Äù (L·∫≠p ƒë·ª©c‚ÄìL·∫≠p c√¥ng - L·∫≠p ng√¥n), which Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© strove for. ‚ÄúLap duc‚Äù, according to the feudal intelligentsia, is devoting to bring about the country‚Äôs prospect and the well-being of its citizens. ‚ÄúLap cong‚Äù bears the meaning of fulfilling the missions assigned by the King. ‚ÄúLap ngon‚Äù is to make a significant contribution to the arts. Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© led a full and varied life insofar as he was once promoted to the rank of General, but then demoted to the lowest rank as a border guard. Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© experienced many ups and downs in his life and career Furthermore, Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© earned a lot of respect as a devoted Confucian scholar and experienced statesman. Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© dedicated nearly all his life to his country and the welfare of its citizens. After his retirement, Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© lived the rest of his life in his hometown and gave a hand with the restoration of pagodas and gave lectures in Buddhism‚Äôs beliefs. When French colonists invaded Viet Nam in 1858, Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© was one of feudal intellectuals bravely fighting against the enemy‚Äôs deployment. Besides, he went unhesitatingly: ‚ÄúShould I be at my last gasp, I will fight tooth and nail for the country‚Äôs freedom and independence.‚Äù Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© died on 7 December 1858. At Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª©‚Äôs funeral came King T·ª± ƒê·ª©c as well as distinguished mourners and The King himself gave the late statesman parallel sentences as an offering ‚Äút·∫£ h·ªØu nghi vƒÉn nghi v√µ- t·ª≠ sinh danh t∆∞·ªõng, danh th·∫ßn‚Äù. They bear the meaning of complimenting Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª© on his great talent for not only literature but also martial arts. Many poems of Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Tr·ª©‚Äôs is on Vietnamese high school curriculum, namely ‚ÄúB√ÄI CA NG·∫§T NG∆Ø·ªûNG‚Äù and ‚ÄúN·ª¢ NAM NHI‚Äù.

Indeed,Buffy Sainte-Marie's Quiet Places Buffy was recorded at much the same time and place as Quiet Places and no label took it up until her last Vanguard recordings had been released. Despite Buffy commanding a high price tag upon completion, MCA did little to promote it. Very few music magazines ever bothered to review it and Buffy was out of print as early as 1978.See Marsh, Dave with Swenson, John (editors); The Rolling Stone Record Guide : Reviews and Ratings of Almost 10,000 Currently Available Rock, Pop, Soul, Country, Blues, Jazz, and Gospel Albums; It has never been reissued independently since then and was only rereleased in 2008 with Changing Woman and Sweet America.

Geography Bukov Vrh nad Visokim is a dispersed settlement in the northwestern part of the Polhov Gradec Hills. It consists of the isolated Dolinec, Golar, Kuzovec, Skobelj, and ≈†vint farms, as well as the hamlet of Podskalar (with the Bo≈°tar, Brnovi, and ≈†u≈°tar farms). The highest elevation in the settlement is Pasja ravan (literally, 'dog plateau', elevation ). Sovpat Creek, a tributary of the Poljane Sora River, borders the settlement to the northeast and is fed by several small creeks in the settlement. The name Sovpat is the Poljane dialect form of the word sopot 'stream with waterfalls'. Name The name Bukov Vrh nad Visokim literally means 'beech peak above Visoko'. Like similar names (e.g., Bukovo, Bukovica, Bukovec, etc.), it is derived from the Slovene adjective bukov, from the common noun bukev 'beech', referring to the local vegetation. History The area was settled between the 12th and early 14th centuries by ethnic Slovenians from Carinthia. During the Second World War there was an engagement between German forces and members of the Partisans' Cankar Brigade at the Skobelj farm, where there is a small memorial. In the 1970s, the Yugoslav People's Army reduced the elevation of Pasja ravan by about in order to install bunkers and launching sites for S-125 Neva antiaircraft missiles.

He has been called the ‚ÄúFather of Silicones‚Äù and is credited with the launch of the silicone industry in the 1930s. His most notable contributions include his creation of silicone from silicon compounds and his method of making fused silica, a high-quality glass later used in aeronautics, advanced telecommunications, and computer chips. His work led to the formation of Dow Corning, an alliance between the Dow Chemical Company and Corning Glass Works that was specifically created to produce silicone products. Life Early years and education James Franklin Hyde was born in Solvay, New York on March 11, 1903. He attended Solvay High School and graduated on June 25, 1919 at the age of 16. He was partly encouraged by one of his science teachers to enter into the field of science. After high school, Hyde attended Syracuse University, where he earned both his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees. Afterwards, he earned a Ph.D. in organic chemistry at the University of Illinois. He then completed his academic education at Harvard University, where he was granted a post-doctoral fellowship under Dr. James Bryant Conant. He also received an Honorary Doctor of Science degree from Syracuse University. Research In 1931, Hyde became the first organic chemist to accept a position at Corning Glass Works (now Corning Incorporated). He was hired to investigate the new plastics that challenged the glass industry. Hyde had studied Kipping and Ladenburg‚Äôs work in the field of organic silicon chemistry and sought to find a flexible, high temperature binder for the glass fibers that would allow for an increase in service temperature for insulating materials. He followed Kipping‚Äôs procedure for creating organic silicon compounds by using Grignard‚Äôs magnesium-containing reagent and eventually synthesized a fluid that hardened to a rubbery mass. This new composite was one of the first Class H insulators and made it possible for Corning to produce high temperature motors and generators. This silicone was used in ships and planes during World War II, as cable and wire insulation, in aeronautical equipment, and in window insulation. Future versions of this silicone would be used in breast implants and in prosthetic heart valves. In 1934, Hyde used a method called ‚Äúflame hydrolysis‚Äù to create fused silica, an impurity-free glass. This method involved heating silicon and oxygen by running silicon tetrachloride gas through an oxygen flame. The result was a fine, glassy powder of silicon dioxide, which could be pressed into various shapes. Hyde‚Äôs method proved to be a breakthrough in glass production. Fused silica was initially used in mirrors, telescopes, radar, and later in spacecraft windows and fiber optics. Corning researchers used this fused silica when they invented optical fiber in 1970, which provided faster transmission speeds than copper wires did. Fused silica has also made the miniaturization of computer chips possible, as it is used in high transmission microlithographic lenses. Decades later, Hyde remarked that ‚Äú[he was] surprised at some of the things [fused silica] has gone into, but [he was] not surprised at the versatility of such a beautiful and useful material.‚Äù He claims that his inspiration for developing his fused silica was the telescope that was being built at the Palomar Observatory in California. However, he was too late to influence this telescope project, which was built by Corning using Pyrex, a glass it developed in 1915. On August 27, 1934, Hyde filed a patent application with the United States Patent Office for ‚Äú[his] method of making a transparent article of silica.‚Äù This patent was granted to him on February 10, 1942. Hyde‚Äôs work led to the formation of the Dow Corning Corporation in 1943, a joint venture by Corning Glass Works and the Dow Chemical Company to produce silicone products. Dr. William Armistead, former vice chairman for technology at Corning Glass Works, not only recognizes Hyde as ‚Äúthe father of silicones,‚Äù but also calls him ‚Äúthe father of Dow Corning.‚Äù The Dow Corning Corporation now operates in more than 20 nations around the world, with $4.94 billion in revenue in 2007. In 1951, Hyde was appointed the position of senior research scientist for basic organosilicon chemistry at Dow Corning. He had previously held the position of manager of the Organic Chemistry Research Laboratory at Corning from 1938 until 1951. Later years In 1973, Hyde retired but continued to serve Dow Corning as a research consultant. J.F. Hyde's formulation for the periodic table of elements. In 1976, he published in the student magazine Chemistry an alternative periodic table of his own design, which allots a central position to the element silicon. Since 1992, the J. Franklin Hyde Scholarship in Science Education has been awarded annually by Dow Corning and the Dow Corning Foundation to outstanding students who plan to teach science at the secondary level. In 2000, Hyde was nominated by Corning Incorporated and inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. For the remainder of his days, Hyde lived alone on Marco Island, Florida. His three children visited him regularly. He is proud of his accomplishments during his career and says that ‚Äúit gives [him] a great satisfaction that [he] did something useful in life.‚Äù Dr. James Franklin Hyde died in his Florida home on October 11, 1999, at the age of 96, with over 100 patents held in his name while at Corning Incorporated. Personal life In 1930, James Franklin Hyde was married to his wife Hildegard. He has three children: James F. Hyde, Ann H. Hyde, and Sylvia Hyde Schuster. Hyde‚Äôs wife Hildegard died in 1991. He said to the New York Times: ‚ÄúWhen you lose someone close to you like that, you never really get over it.‚Äù Patents * Hyde, , \\"Method of making a transparent article of silica\\" Notes References *Goosey, Martin T.

Watkins (born June 20, 1971) is an American author, economist, political analyst, and social commentator. During his academic career, Boyce Watkins was a visiting scholar with the Barbara Jordan - Mickey Leland School Of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University. Boyce Watkins has been a former Visiting Fellow at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics and the Centre for European Economic Research (Mannheim, Germany). Watkins is a member, by donation, of the College Sports Research Institute at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He has authored several financial advice books, including Financial Lovemaking 101: Merging Assets with your Partner in Ways that Feel Good, Black American Money, as well as What if George Bush were a Black Man?; his work has also appeared in such publications as the Journal of Small Business Management and The Journal of Economics and Business. In addition to publishing scholarly articles on finance and investing, Watkins is an advocate for education, economic empowerment, and social justice, and has made regular appearances in various national media outlets, including CNN, Good Morning America, MSNBC, Fox News, BET, NPR, Essence Magazine, USA Today, Today, ESPN, The Tom Joyner Morning Show, and CBS Sports. He was also a frequent guest on The Wendy Williams Experience radio program, and remains a frequent contributor to theGrio and TheLoop21.com. Early life Watkins was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to a teen mother. His father left shortly after his birth and only spoke to his son three times. Watkins' mother, Robin Couch, married when Boyce was 3 years old to Larry Watkins, a young Vietnam veteran from Louisville. The family struggled for years but worked hard for economic advancement. Watkins' mother encouraged her children to be the best they could be at anything they did. Larry, who would become Watkins' adopted father, was a tough, stern head of the household who joined the local police force at the age of 30. Watkins struggled in school, earning very poor grades all throughout. His teachers placed him in special education and told him he was not smart enough to go to college. \\"When I look back on those years as a black boy in a racist state like Kentucky, I get angry,\\" says Watkins. \\"I almost lost the future that God had in store for me.\\" In high school, Watkins was captain of his track team. He also had a job working for Taco Bell, along with other fast food restaurants. Watkins' teenage years were tough. His father was a good provider, but very tough, leading him to feel abandoned and unloved. His uncle, 8 years his senior, was regularly sent to prison, which only added to his feelings of abandonment. \\"Those were tough years for me,\\" says Watkins. \\"I honestly think my mind has blocked them out.\\" Watkins received a small scholarship to the University of Kentucky, from a group called \\"Black Achievers\\", based in Louisville, which was just enough to pay his tuition. Early adulthood During his senior year in high school, Watkins met his first girlfriend. Six months after high school graduation, she gave birth to their first and only child. He was a freshman in college at the time, and the child was born during winter break. The pressure of fatherhood further motivated Watkins to work hard in school. It was during his first semester at the University of Kentucky that he earned straight As for the first time in his life. Watkins went on to win several honors in college, including Freshman of the Year, Sophomore of the Year, and numerous scholarships. He finished with a triple major in Finance, Economics, and Business Management. He was selected as The Wall Street Journal Outstanding Graduating Senior in Finance and went on to begin pursuing his PhD at Indiana University. Beginnings of his career in social activism Watkins left the PhD program soon afterwards, deciding to return to his alma mater, the University of Kentucky, in order to study mathematics and statistics, two subjects he'd struggled with in the past. It was during his time as a graduate student at the University of Kentucky that Watkins became more involved with political activism. The racism in the language used in his campus newspaper, The Kentucky Kernel, led Watkins to begin writing columns himself. In his work, he challenged the racially divisive foundations of his campus. Watkins also battled with the university president at the time, Charles Wethington III, referring to him as \\"Chuck\\" and claiming that he was racially insensitive and unqualified to be a campus president. Syracuse University After leaving the University of Kentucky, Watkins spent a year at the University of Rochester, then eventually transferred to Ohio State University to finish his PhD. Working under Ren√© M. Stulz, David Hirshleifer, and Andrew Karolyi, Watkins finished his PhD at Ohio State University. His first academic position was with Syracuse University. Career In 2004, Watkins completed his first book, Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about College‚ÄîA Guide for Minority Students. The book was a success and began his work in public scholarship. \\"I wrote this book for all the young kids like me who were told they can't go to college,\\" said Watkins. A few months later, Watkins created his second book, What if George Bush were a Black Man?, a satirical discussion of President George W. Bush and what he perceives as the presence of white privilege in America. Watkins explores the criminal justice system, the educational system, and the economic systems of America, using statistics and anecdotes to describe likely fates for President Bush and other privileged individuals if they were poor and Black. Watkins' next books were Financial Lovemaking 101: Merging Assets with Your Partner in Ways that Feel Good, The Parental 411: What Every Parent should Know about Their Child in College, and Quick and Dirty Secrets of College Success: A Professor Tells It All. Bill O'Reilly and Juan Williams Watkins has an ongoing feud with Bill O'Reilly from Fox News. Watkins referred to O'Reilly and Sean Hannity as \\"UnAmerican borderline Klansmen who graduated from the Rush Limbaugh School of Arrogant Self-righteousness\\". During one CNN episode, after O'Reilly made controversial statements about African Americans during his visit to Sylvia's Restaurant of Harlem, Watkins referred to Juan Williams as \\"Bill O'Reilly's happy little Negro\\", in reference to Williams' insistence that O'Reilly did nothing wrong. In response, Williams wrote a scathing piece about Watkins in TIME. O'Reilly spent a week on his show calling for Watkins to be fired from his post at Syracuse University. Watkins referred to O'Reilly, Hannity, and Limbaugh as \\"The Axis of Ignorance\\" for what Watkins believed were racist attacks against the Black community. Later in the spring of 2008, Watkins formed an online protest through his website YourBlackWorld.com. In response to Fox News criticism of Senator Barack Obama and Pastor Jeremiah Wright, Watkins asked his supporters to write to Bill O'Reilly's corporate sponsors and complain about O'Reilly's behavior. Watkins' protest led O'Reilly to call for Watkins to be fired and to seek interviews with the Chancellor of Syracuse University, Nancy Cantor. He also sent reporters to question Cantor and ask her why she had not challenged Watkins for his words. In his comments, O'Reilly claimed that Watkins had accused him of wanting to lynch Michelle Obama, the wife of then Senator Barack Obama, and that Watkins was \\"smearing the good name of Syracuse University by spreading these kinds of lies\\". O'Reilly had made the following remark about Michelle Obama and lynching on February 21, 2008: \\"I don't want to go on a lynching party against Michelle Obama unless there's evidence, hard facts, that say this is how the woman really feels. If that's how she really feels ‚Äî that America is a bad country or a flawed nation, whatever ‚Äî then that's legit.\\" He later apologized, saying, \\"I'm sorry if my statement offended anybody\\", on his February 22, 2008 program. Challenge to the NCAA Watkins is an advocate for the rights of college athletes. In his work as a faculty affiliate for the College Sport Research Institute at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Watkins has challenged the NCAA on its refusal to compensate college athletes, stating that the NCAA exploits Black families by using young men for their athletic ability and refusing to share the wealth with their families. In his work, Watkins has appeared on several national media outlets, including CNN, ESPN, Fox, and CBS Sports explaining why athletes should be compensated. He has also challenged the tax exempt status of the NCAA, stating that the United States Congress should step in and conduct an anti-trust investigation into the NCAA. In op-ed pieces opposite NCAA President Myles Brand, Watkins has argued that students' rights are being violated on a regular basis by the NCAA and that a fairer compensation model should be used by the league. He cites that the revenues from NCAA March Madness exceed that of the Super Bowl and the World Series combined. Watkins also cites the fact that many coaches are made into millionaires by a system designed to keep star athletes and their families in poverty. At the conference for the North American Society for the Sociology of Sport (NASSS), Watkins cited the work of sociologist Harry Edwards during the 1968 Olympics as a springboard for Black athlete activism. \\"Like hookers kept dazed on drugs, the Black athlete is kept ignorant by his coaches so they can continue to rob him blind,\\" said Watkins. \\"Coaches in college are given little incentive to increase graduation rates, and even choose the classes for the athletes. It's a sham.\\" Financial activism Through his position at Syracuse University and YourBlackWorld.com, Watkins also provides regular financial advice to a largely African American audience. He argues that African Americans should consider their financial independence to be part of their spiritual and social independence. He also argues that African Americans should find a way to \\"own the land on which you stand\\", in order to be truly liberated in America. BET and Lil Wayne Watkins has been highly critical of hip-hop, Black Entertainment Television and rap artist Lil Wayne. After reading the lyrics to Wayne's song, \\"We Be Steady Mobbin'\\", Watkins said that he was \\"ditching Lil Wayne completely\\" and that Wayne had \\"positioned himself as an enemy of the black community\\" who can be linked to \\"the holocaust occurring within the black community today\\". He has also said that Black Entertainment Television has an agenda similar to that of the Ku Klux Klan. Adidas and the \\"Slave Shoes\\" Watkins slammed the sportsgear firm Adidas for its JS Roundhouse Mid shoe created with a shackle design. In an op-ed, Watkins dubbed the design as \\"slave shoes\\". Before canceling the shoe, Adidas wrote a statement in support of the designer and the design, indicating: the shoe \\"is nothing more than the designer Jeremy Scott's outrageous and unique take on fashion and has nothing to do with slavery.\\" Civil Rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson agreed with Watkins, stating: \\"The attempt to commercialize and make popular more than 200 years of human degradation, where blacks were considered three-fifths human by our Constitution is offensive, appalling and insensitive\\". Russell Simmons and The War On Drugs Watkins joined hip- hop mogul Russell Simmons to co-author a letter urging President Barack Obama to put an end to Ronald Reagan's War on Drugs. The letter acquired more than 175 signatures from celebrities, activists, business and thought leaders, and scholars. Simmons and Watkins outlined specific programs the president could enforce to put an end to the War on Drugs, including supporting the Youth Prison Reduction through Opportunities, Mentoring, Intervention, Support, and Education (Youth PROMISE) Act; forming a panel to review requests for clemency that come to the Office of the Pardon Attorney; and increasing transitioning programs for released inmates. Following the release of the letter, President Obama declared an end of the War on Drugs with strategies to treat addictions and diverting non-violent drug offenders into treatment instead of prisons. Mountain Dew; Tyler, The Creator; and Lil Wayne Watkins criticized Mountain Dew for approving what he dubbed to be \\"the most racist commercial in history\\", created by Tyler, The Creator. He also slammed the beverage company for paying rapper Lil Wayne a lucrative endorsement deal following his derogatory lyrics about Civil Rights icon Emmett Till. As a result of a call for the ad to be pulled and calls to be made to Clear Channel by the Mamie Till Mobley Foundation as well as a petition created by other activists and spearheaded by Reena Walker, Mountain Dew was forced to pull the series of commercials created by Tyler, the Creator and pull the plug on Lil Wayne's lucrative endorsement deal. Watkins and Tyler, the Creator engaged in an exchange of Twitter messages, in which Watkins stated he had an \\"altered perspective\\" after listening to Tyler, the Creator's music. Media outlets ran with Watkins' statement, claiming he had recanted his initial stance. Watkins later clarified the nature of his Tweet in a YouTube video, stating he does not approve of the commercial. Controversies Watkins drew controversy on Twitter after condemning Kamala Harris for marrying a white man despite having attended an HBCU,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/kamala- harris-didnt-lie-about-listening-snoop-dogg/582982/ and later for making comments about singer Lizzo that were widely interpreted as fat- shaming.https://edition.cnn.com/2019/12/27/entertainment/lizzo-fat-shaming- doctor-trnd/index.html References External links * Category:African- American academics Category:Syracuse University faculty Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Writers from Louisville, Kentucky Category:University of Kentucky alumni Category:American social commentators Category:Academics from Kentucky ","title":"Boyce Watkins"},{"id":"20288748","text":"Steve Dildarian (born November 3, 1969) is an American former advertising copywriter who is the creator, writer, producer and voice of Tim in the HBO animated television series The Life & Times of Tim (2008‚Äì2012).

British Journal of Psychology, 98(2), 339-359. An experiment conducted in Britain supports kin selection The experiment is illustrated by diagrams below. The result shows that people are more willing to provide help to people with higher relatedness and occurs in both gender and various cultures. The result also show gender difference in kin selection which men are more affected by the cues of similar genetic based than women. Reciprocal Altruism Reciprocal altruism Reciprocal altruism is the idea that the incentive for an individual to help in the present is based on the expectation of the potential receipt in the future.Trivers, Robert (1971) The evolution of reciprocal altruism. Quarterly Review of Biology, 46, 35-56. Robert Trivers believes it to be advantageous for an organism to pay a cost to his or her own life for another non-related organism if the favor is repaid (only when the benefit of the sacrifice outweighs the cost). As Peter SingerSinger, Peter (1994). Ethics. Oxford: Oxford University. notes, ‚Äúreciprocity is found amongst all social mammals with long memories who live in stable communities and recognize each other as individuals.‚Äù Individuals should identify cheaters (those who do not reciprocate help) who lose the benefit of help from them in the future, as seen in blood-sharing in vampire bats.Wilkinson, G. S. (1984) ‚ÄòReciprocal Food Sharing in the Vampire Bat‚Äô, Nature, 308, 181-184. Trade in economic trades and businessLoch, C. H., & Wu, Y. (2007). \\"Behavioral Operations Management\\". Foundations and Trends in Technology, Information and Operations Management,1(3), 121-232. may underlie reciprocal altruism in which products given and received involve different exchanges.Kaplan, H., and Hill, K. (1985). Food Sharing among Ache Foragers: Tests of Explanatory Hypotheses. Current Anthropology, 26, 223‚Äì245. Economic trades follow the ‚ÄúI‚Äôll scratch your back if you scratch mine‚Äù principle. A pattern of frequent giving and receiving of help among workers boost both productivity and social standing. Reciprocal altruism Negative-state relief model The negative-state relief model of helpingFultz. J, Schaller.M, & Cialdini. R.B. (1988). Empathy, sadness and distress: Three related but distinct vicarious affective responses to anothers' suffering. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 14, 312- 315. states that people help because of egoism. Egoistic motives lead one to help others in bad circumstances in order to reduce personal distress experienced from knowing the situation of the people in need. Helping behavior happens only when the personal distress cannot be relieved by other actions. The model explains also people's avoidance behavior from people in need: this is another way of reducing distress. =Supporting studies= 1) Guilt feelings were induced to subjects by having participants accidentally ruin a student's thesis data or seeing the data being ruined. Some subjects experience positive events afterwards, e.g. being praised. Results show that subjects who experience negative guilt feelings are more motivated to help than those who had neutral emotion. However, once the negative mood was relieved by receiving praise, subjects no longer had high motivation in helping.Cialdini, R. B., Darby, B. L., Vincent, J. E. (1973). Transgression and altruism: a case of hedonism. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 9(6), 501-516. Negative State Relief Model 2) Schaller and Cialdini found that people who are anticipating positive events (listening to a comedy tape), will show low helping motivation since they are expecting their negative emotions to be lifted up by the upcoming stimulation. Empathy-altruism hypothesis Helping behavior may be initiated when we feel empathy for the person, that is, identifying with another person and feeling and understanding what that person is experiencing.Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., Akert. R.M. (1997). Social Psychology (2nd Ed.). The US: Addison-Ewsley Educational Publishers Inc.Gilovich, T., Keltner, D. & Nisbett, R.E. (2006) Social Psychology. New York: W. W. Norton. According to the Empathy-altruism hypothesis by Daniel Batson (1991),Batson, C.D., & Shaw, L.L. (1991). Evidence for altruism: Toward a pluralism of prosocial motives. Psychological Inquiry, 2,107-122. the decision of helping or not depends primarily on whether you feel empathy for the person and secondarily on the cost and rewards (social exchange concerns). It can be illustrated in the following diagram: The hypothesis was supported by some studies. For example, a study conducted by Fultz and his colleagues (1986)Fultz, J., Batson, C.D., Fortenbach, V.A., McCarthy, P.M., & Varney, L. (1986). Social evaluation and the empathy altruism hypothesis. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology,50,761-769. divided participants into a high-empathy group and a low-empathy group. They both had to listen to another student, Janet, who reported feeling lonely. The study found that high-empathy group (told to imagine vividly how Janet felt) volunteered to spend more time with Janet, whether or not their help is anonymous, which makes the social reward lower. It shows that if the person feels empathy, they will help without considering the cost and reward, and it complies with the empathy- altruism hypothesis. Responsibility ‚Äì prosocial value orientation A strong influence on helping is a feeling of and belief in one's responsibility to help, especially when combined with the belief that one is able to help other people. The responsibility to help can be the result of a situation focusing responsibility on a person, or it can be a characteristic of individuals (leading to helping when activated by others' need). Staub has described a \\"prosocial value orientation\\" that made helping more likely both when a person was in physical distress and psychological distress. Prosocial orientation was also negatively related to aggression in boys, and positively related to \\"constructive patriotism\\". The components of this orientation are a positive view of human beings, concern about others' welfare, and a feeling of and belief in one's responsibility for others' welfare. Social exchange theory According to the social-exchange theory, people help because they want to gain goods from the one being helped.Foa, U. G., & Foa, E. B. (1975). Resource theory of social exchange. Morrisontown, N.J.: General Learning Press. People calculate rewards and costs of helping others, and aim at maximizing the former and minimizing the latter, which is known as a ‚Äúminimax‚Äù strategy. Rewards are incentives, which can be materialistic goods, social rewards which can improve one's image and reputation (e.g. praise) or self- reward.Campbell, D. T. (1975). On the conflicts between biological and social evolution and between psychology and moral tradition. American Psychologist, 30, 1103‚Äì1126.Nowak, M. A., & Sigmund, K. (1998). Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring. Nature, 393, 573-576.Nowak, M. A., Page, K. M., & Sigmund, K. (2000). Fairness versus reason in the ultimatum game. Science, 289, 1773‚Äì1775.Gilovich, T., Keltner, D. & Nisbett, R.E. (2006). Social Psychology. New York: W. W. Norton. Rewards are either external or internal. External reward is things that obtained from others when helping them, for instance, friendship and gratitude. People are more likely to help those who are more attractive or important, whose approval is desired.Krebs, D. (1970). Altruism‚ÄîAn examination of the concept and a review of the literature. Psychological Bulletin, 72, 258-302.Unger, R. K. (1979). Whom does helping help? Paper presented at the Eastern Psychological Association convention, April. Internal reward is generated by oneself when helping, for example, sense of goodness and self-satisfaction. When seeing someone in distress, one would empathize the victim and are aroused and distressed. We may choose to help in order to reduce the arousal and distress.Piliavin, J. A., & Piliavin, I. M. (1973). The Good Samaritan: Why does he help? Unpublished manuscript, University of Wisconsin Preceding helping behavior, people consciously calculate the benefits and costs of helping and not helping, and they help when the overall benefit of helping outweigh the cost.Myers, D. G. (1999). Social psychology. (6th ed.). United States of America: McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Social Exchange Theory Implications Cultural differences A major cultural difference is the difference between collectivism and individualism. Collectivists attend more to the needs and goals of the group they belong to, and individualists focus on their own selves. With such contrast, collectivists would be more likely to help the ingroup members, but less frequent than individualists to help strangers.Triandis, H. C. (1991). Cross-cultural differences in assertiveness/competition vs. group loyalty/cooperation. In R. A. Hinde, & J. Groebel (Ed), Cooperation and prosocial behavior (pp. 78‚Äì88). New York: Cambridge University Press. Economic environment Helping is influenced by economic environment within the culture. In general, frequency of helping behavior is inversely related to the country economic status.Levine, R. V., Norenzayan, A., Philbrick, K. (2001) Cross-cultural differences in helping strangers. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 32(5), 543-560. Rural vs. urban area The context influences helping behaviors. While there is a myth that small towns are \\"safer\\" and \\"friendlier\\", it has yet to be proven. In a meta-analytical study by Nancy Steblay, she found out that either extreme, urban (300,000 people or more) or rural environments(5,000 people or less), are that worst places if you're looking for help.Steblay, N. M. (1987). Helping behavior in rural and urban environments: A meta-analysis. Psychology Bulletin, 102, 346-356. Choosing a role Edgar Henry Schein, former professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, assigns three different roles people follow when responding to offers of help. These generic helping roles are The Expert Resource Role, The Doctor Role, The Process Consultant Role. The Expert Resource Role is the most common of the three. It assumes the client, the person being helped, is seeking information or expert service that they cannot provide for themselves. For example, simple issues like asking for directions or more complex issues like an organization hiring a financial consultant will fall into this category. The Doctor Role can be confused with the Expert Role because they seem to overlap each other. This role includes the client asking for information and service but also demands a diagnosis and prescription. Doctors, counselors, coaches, and repair personnel fulfill this kind of role. Contrary to the expert role, the Doctor Role shifts more power to the helper who is responsible for the previously mentioned duties; diagnosing, prescribing, and administering the cure. Schein describes the Process Consultant Role where the helper focuses on the communication process from the very beginning. Before help can start, there needs to be an establishment of trust between the helper and the client. For example, in order for a tech consultant to be effective, he or she has to take a few minutes to discuss what the situation is, how often the problem occurs, what has been tried before, etc. before transitioning into the expert role or the doctor role.

It falls within the Canadian federal electoral district of Medicine Hat‚ÄîCardston‚ÄîWarner.  History  The first settler of the area was Thomas Rowell Leavitt, a Latter-day Saint from Utah Territory who came to Alberta fleeing a United States government crackdown on polygamy during a wave of late nineteenth century Latter-day Saint emigration to Canada and Mexico. The settlement's first name was Buffalo Flats, but it was subsequently changed to Leavitt in honour of the early Latter-day Saint settler.cardstoncounty.com Cardston was the first Latter-day Saint settlement in Canada, and Leavitt was founded by a like-minded Latter- day Saint. Thomas Rowell Leavitt was born in Hatley, Quebec, Canada in 1834. Early converts to Mormonism, his parents subsequently moved to Utah.The Leavitt family were Americans by descent, their ancestor Jeremiah Leavitt having been a farmer born at Exeter, New Hampshire. The family later removed to Hatley, Quebec, a few kilometres from the U.S. border, then subsequently to Utah. Their English immigrant ancestor was Puritan John Leavitt of Hingham, Massachusetts, founding deacon of Old Ship Church, the oldest church in America in continuous use and the only remaining seventeenth-century Puritan meeting house in New England. Dudley Leavitt, an early patriarch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was from the same family. Former United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt is also a descendant of these early Latter-day Saint Leavitts from Hatley. He had 26 children: 12 with his wife Ann Eliza; 9 with wife Antoinette; and 5 with Harriet Martha. Four children died in their infancy, leaving 22 children who grew to adulthood. Twenty of the 22 eventually chose to remain in Canada as citizens, and today there are many Leavitts in the region, descendants of the original pioneer.Once Upon a Wedding: Stories of Weddings in Western Canada, Nancy Millar, Bayeux Arts, 2000 Thomas Rowell 'Tom' Leavitt was a farmer who had previously served as constable, marshal and sheriff of Wellsville, Utah. To reach Canada, Leavitt endured a six-week, journey in early spring 1887.Conquerors of the West: Stalwart Mormon Pioneers, Vol. II, Florence C. Youngberg, National Society, Sons of Utah Pioneers, Agreka Books, 1998 He and his party reached their destination at Lee Creek, Alberta, on May 25. They had come in covered wagons‚Äîthe last recorded pioneer wagon train in the Old West. He had left his first wife Ann Eliza (Jenkins) behind at his Wellsville ranch, and Leavitt was accompanied on his trek by his third wife Harriet Martha (Dowdle), along with several of his children by his three wives. The first school met in the church building, completed July 10, 1896. Thomas Leavitt's son Alfred, born in Utah, followed his father to Alberta in 1897. He and his brothers helped dig the irrigation canals that Charles Ora Card, founder of Cardston, had promised the Canadian government in return for more land grants to Latter-day Saint settlers. Basking in the shadow of Chief Mountain and the Canadian Rockies range, the hamlet of Leavitt is located in a valley of rolling hills only kilometres from the U.S.-Canada border. Cattle ranching and agriculture make up most of the area's economy. The Latter-day Saint legacy still tinctures much of this area of Alberta. Much of the region's population is still heavily Latter-day Saint, which is typified by the large Cardston Alberta Temple in Cardston. The Hamlet of Leavitt's first post office opened in 1900 with Walter Glenn the first postmaster; the post office closed permanently in 1968. During those 68 years, three Leavitt family members acted as postmaster.Leavitt, Library and Archives Canada, www.collectionscanada.gc.ca The founder of Leavitt, former sheriff Tom Leavitt, died in 1891. The Leavitt Chapel, a meetinghouse for the Cardston Stake, was built in 1896, and remained in use until the 1950s. Much of the area around Leavitt is sparsely settled.

This memory addressing limitation and the later workarounds necessary to overcome it are functionally similar to the memory limits of the early 8088 IBM PC memory architecture (see Conventional memory). Similar situations have often arisen in the history of computing, when hardware intended to have up to a certain level of resources is designed to handle several times the maximum expected amount, which eventually becomes a severe restriction as Moore's law increases resources economically available. The original IBM PC was typically supplied with 64 KB of memory or less; it was designed to take a maximum of 640 KB, far more than it was thought would ever be needed. This rapidly became a restriction that had to be handled by complex DOS memory management. Similar successive restrictions in size have been imposed and overcome on hard drives. Unavailable memory The loss of usable memory caused by the PCI hole, when using memory-mapped I/O, is caused by using the same address space for both physical memory and to communicate with hardware devices. Thus, installed hardware devices need some of the address space in order to communicate with the processor and system software. As 32-bit hardware has a total of four gigabytes of addressable memory, some of the real physical memory of a 32-bit machine, when enough memory is installed, needs to be sacrificed by making it hidden so the devices have room to communicate. Which part of physical memory becomes replaced with the device communication space depends upon the machine, but it is usually anything above 2.5 to 3.5 GB. The amount of system memory that is hidden and unavailable varies widely with the actual mainboard and chipset, the BIOS, the amount of physical memory, the amount of video RAM installed on graphics cards, and the number and type of PCI cards installed in the system. More than a gigabyte of 32-bit system memory can be unavailable when four gigabytes of physical memory and multiple 3D cards with large amounts of video memory are installed; on some mainboards, the hole is always at least one gigabyte in size regardless of the installed expansion cards. Physical address extension A workaround first developed in the Pentium Pro, known as Physical Address Extension (PAE), allows certain 32-bit operating systems to access up to 36-bit memory addresses, even though individual programs are still limited to operating within 32 bits of address space. Provided there is enough memory installed, each program can have its own four-gigabyte addressing space, together utilizing up to 64 gigabytes of memory across all programs. But PAE alone is not enough to address the PCI hole issue, as memory addresses and I/O PCI addresses are still overlapping somewhere between the 3rd and 4th gigabyte. A PAE compatible operating system together with a PAE compatible CPU cannot do better than accessing memory from the 1st to the 3rd gigabyte, then from the 5th to the 64th gigabyte. The PCI hole is still there. On a 4GB host, and in the absence of one or another additional workaround, PAE does nothing for accessing the ~1GB memory overlapped by the PCI I/O. PAE was fully supported in Windows XP up to the Service Pack 1 (SP1) release, but then withdrawn for SP2; the only 32-bit versions of Microsoft Windows to fully support this are certain high-end server versions of Windows Server 2003 and earlier; as of 2014, it is mainly in use by 32-bit Linux distributions; Ubuntu has made it mandatory for its 32-bit version since 2013. Microsoft disabled the support in Windows XP SP2 and later operating systems because there were many compatibility problems with graphics card and other devices, which needed PAE-aware drivers, distinct from both standard 32-bit and later 64-bit drivers.Dansdata: What's with the 3Gb memory barrier? Many versions of MS Windows can activate what is still called PAE for the purpose of using the NX bit, but this no longer extends the address space. Filling the memory hole As stated earlier, in a 32-bit PAE-enabled and even in 64-bit systems, memory below and above the \\"memory hole\\" is available, but 512 MB to 1.5 GB of RAM is unavailable, around the 3rd gigabyte, because it uses there memory addresses required for devices. With the decreasing cost of memory this may not be a serious issue, but there are ways to regain access to the missing memory. Mapping devices to addresses above 4 GB The limitations of the 32-bit PCI hole can affect purely 64-bit operating systems as the system BIOS must cater for all operating systems which are supported by the hardware (16-, 32-, and 64-bit operating systems all run on the same hardware). The BIOS must be able to boot mapping all devices below four gigabytes, although a 64-bit system does not require this. Many BIOSes can be configured by the user to fill the memory hole by mapping devices high up in the 64-bit address space, so long as the devices, their drivers, and the chipset all support this. A machine configured this way cannot boot into a 16- or 32-bit operating system; if a machine is set up this way, the BIOS setup must be temporarily changed to boot into a 16- or 32-bit operating system, e.g. from a bootable CD or USB storage device. Mapping memory to addresses above 4 GB Another way to remove the PCI hole, which is only useful for 64-bit operating systems and those 32-bit systems that support the Physical Address Extension method described above, is to \\"remap\\" some or all of the memory between the two- and four-gigabyte limits to addresses above four gigabytes. This needs to be supported by the chipset of the computer and can usually be activated in the BIOS Setup. This remapping works on the level of physical addresses, unlike the higher-level remapping of virtual to physical addresses that happens inside the CPU core. Activating this for traditional 32-bit operating systems does more harm than good, as the remapped memory (often larger than the PCI hole itself) is unusable to such operating systems, even though e.g. Windows Vista will show such memory to physically exist on the \\"System Properties\\" page.

It was reviewed as an \\"Outstanding Academic Book\\" by Michael Perelman. Summary The book is divided into three sections. The following summary is based on the second edition (though some references are to the first). Wood's Marxist approach originates from Karl Marx's critique of political economy in his works Das Kapital and Grundrisse.1999, p. 35. In the capitalist form of society, human labor power is for sale in the market as one of many commodities.1999, p. 2. Goods and services, including those regarding the most basic necessities of life, are produced for profitable exchange. All the actors in a such system are driven by competition and profit-maximization. However, the study presents capitalists' appropriation of \\"workers' surplus labor without coercion\\"1999, p. 70. by using the market to set rates of compensation both for wages and for appropriation as the most distinctive and historically important feature of capitalism. Thus it argues that the origin of capitalism lies fundamentally in social property relations rather than in trade and commerce. Wood argues that past historians have tended to see capitalism as a natural and even inevitable human behaviour, which came into being when barriers to trade and commerce were removed: essentially, in their understanding, people were waiting for the opportunity to become capitalists. Wood argues rather that capitalism did not come about until a set of unique historical circumstances compelled people to. Part I, 'Histories of the Transition' In Part I, Wood surveys past work on the transition to capitalism. She sketches how Adam Smith, Max Weber, Fernand Braudel, and Henri Pirenne assumed that capitalism naturally arises from trade, commerce, and urbanisation once city-dwellers have accumulated enough primitive capital to be able to reinvest it in production. However, she also finds that even commentators who were critical of this account tend to argue that the transition to capitalism entailed farmers seizing new opportunities to switch from subsistence to commodity production as the constraints of feudalism were loosened. Examples include Karl Marx himself, Karl Polanyi, Paul Sweezy, Maurice Dobb, Rodney Hilton, and Perry Anderson. This suggests that capitalism is a natural and inevitable behaviour, waiting for its opportunity, rather than historically unusual and specific. Building particularly on the arguments made in the Brenner Debate and on the work of E. P. Thompson, Wood argues that 'we need a form of history that brings this specificity into sharp relief'.2002, p. 69. Part II, 'The Origin of Capitalism' In Part II, Wood argues that capitalism emerged in the unique conditions of late medieval and early modern English agrarian society, basing her argument firmly on Robert Brenner's ‚ÄòAgrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe‚Äô.Brenner, Robert (1976). ‚ÄòAgrarian Class Structure and Economic Development in Pre-Industrial Europe,‚Äô Past & Present, 70, February, pp. 30-75. She argues that commerce is not equivalent to capitalism and does not produce it because 'the dominant principle of trade everywhere was not surplus value derived from production but \\"profit on alienation\\", \\"buying cheap and selling dear\\" ':2002, p. 78. that is, although trade involves the seeking of profits, it does not in itself affect how goods are produced. Wood argues that polities which flourished from trade such as medieval Florence and the early-modern Dutch Republic that did not become capitalist are not examples of a 'failed transition', but rather examples of how trade and urbanisation has flourished widely in human history without capitalism developing. She likewise argues that various past societies, such as early modern France, had peasantries with ample opportunity to enter into commercial production, which, however, did not take this opportunity. Thus Wood concludes that capitalism must have arisen from changing imperatives in fundamental relations of production.Perelman, Oct. 1999 Wood sees these unique circumstances arising in late medieval and early-modern England (particularly the south-east). In the wake of the Norman Conquest, the English state was unusually centralised. This gave aristocrats relatively limited powers to extract wealth directly from their feudal underlings through political means (not least the threat of violence). England's centralisation also meant that an unusual number of English farmers were not peasants (with their own land and thus direct access to subsistence) but tenants (renting their land). These circumstances produced a market in leases. Landlords, lacking other ways to extract wealth, were incentivised to rent to those tenants who could pay the most, while tenants, lacking security of tenure, were incentivised to farm as productively as possible to be able to win leases in a competitive market. This led to a cascade of effects whereby successful tenant farmers became agrarian capitalists; unsuccessful ones became wage-labourers, required to sell their labour in order to live; and landlords promoted the privatisation and renting out of common land, not least through the enclosures. David McNally, \\"Ellen Meiksins Wood obituary\\" The Guardian. 'It was not merchants or manufacturers who drove the process that propelled the early development of capitalism. The transformation of social property relations was firmly rooted in the countryside, and the transformation of England's trade and industry was result more than cause of England's transition to capitalism'.2002, p. 129. Part III, 'Agrarian Capitalism and Beyond' In Part III, Wood sketches how industrial capitalism developed from its agrarian English origins. She argues that the end of subsistence farming produced a large population which needed both to sell its labour and to buy basic necessities of life, creating a mass consumer market quite different from the markets for luxury goods that characterised non-capitalist commerce. This mass market underpinned the development of mass production. Wood argues that England's rising productivity slowly but inevitably forced competing economies to enter capitalist modes of production: although the development of capitalism was a chance event, it set in motion a transition that would become global. She argues that English capitalism did not cause England's imperialism, noting that neighbouring non- capitalist economies like Spain and France also built overseas empires. She does find, however, that English capitalism produced a distinctive kind of imperialism. Rather than ruling purely through 'extra-economic' methods of exerting power (such as force), England exported its model of social property relations to its colonies, providing powerful economic imperatives for people to adopt capitalism. English imperialism also drew on the nascent capitalist ideology of thinkers such as Thomas More, Sir John Davies, John Locke, and William Petty to justify taking the land of peoples who were thought not to be making sufficiently productive use of it. Wood sketches the reliance of capitalism on the political structures of the nation-state (particularly its protection of private property), and emphasises that the humane and universalist ideas of the Enlightenment emerged in the still non-capitalist France of the eighteenth century, setting Enlightenment ideas in contrast to capitalist ideologies. Finally, she emphasises that if capitalism is a historically specific and unusual development, it is not inevitable or the only way that humans might organise themselves.

The play combines two legends, one related of the holy man Sh≈çk≈´ (concerning the identity of the harlot of Mura with the bodhisattva Fugen) and the other related of the monk Saigy≈ç (the admonishment of the harlot of Eguchi). Plot summary A travelling monk arrives by night at the port of Eguchi. Seeing a cairn, he enquires about its origin and is told that it commemorates the Lady of Eguchi, a former harlot who was considered to be a manifestation of the bodhisattva Fugen. (During a rainstorm, the 12th-century monk Saigy≈ç asked for shelter at her house, but was refused entry. He reproached her with an impromptu poem, to which she made an effective reply, hinging on a Buddhist interpretation of the words \\"a moment's refuge\\"; she then admitted him and engaged in a long conversation.) The travelling monk thoughtfully recites Saigy≈ç's poem to himself, and is overheard by a passing woman, who asks him to follow it with the harlot's reply. She tells the monk not to believe the gossip about her; when she vanishes they realise that she is, in fact, the ghost of the harlot of Eguchi. A villager then tells them the story of Sh≈çk≈´, who longed to worship the living Fugen, and was directed in a dream to seek the Lady of Eguchi.

They sing of the unhappiness of mortals ensnared in illusion and condemned to be reborn. In conclusion, they remind the monk that \\"all things are a moment's refuge\\"; the Lady reveals her identity as Fugen, and ascends into the clouds. References *Royall Tyler. Japanese N≈ç Dramas.

Telecast on CBS, the series presented stories previously published in True magazine. Articles from the magazine were adapted to television by Gene Roddenberry and other screenwriters. Jack Webb produced and hosted the thirty-three episodes during his stint as head of Warner Brothers Television through his Mark VII Limited Company. The series aired from September 30, 1962 until May 26, 1963, with repeats through September 1963. Program overview The show had a unique opening: A huge \\"True\\" sign, apparently five stories tall, darkened, was seen in deep shadows. Jack Webb announced, \\"This is True!\\" Strong symphonic music included timpani rhythms, followed by the majestic opening theme. The True sign became brightly lit as Webb walked alongside the illuminated sign in an off-stage direction. A classic quotation from such figures as Daniel Webster then appeared. In an overview of the 1962 television season, Time noted: :Jack (\\"dum-de-dum-dum\\") Webb is back. This time he is retelling stories from the files of True magazine. The first one was set on a hospital ship off Okinawa, where a doctor (played by William Conrad) operated on a marine who had a live and sensitive shell in his body capable of blowing a six-foot hole in a steel deck. It was a hell of a moment, but Webb sank it. \\"At 1830 hours exactly,\\" he intoned, \\"the operation began on a human bomb dead center in the circle of death.\\" He hosts the program in an echo-chambered voice, while he stands beside the word TRUE, spelled out in block letters 22 feet high, or roughly ten times as tall as Jack Webb.\\"The New Season,\\" Time, October 12, 1962 GE True aired at 9:30 p.m. Sundays, following the last season of the former ABC sitcom, The Real McCoys, starring Walter Brennan and Richard Crenna, renamed on the CBS schedule as The McCoys. GE True aired a half-hour later than a predecessor series, General Electric Theater, hosted by Ronald W. Reagan, which at had aired at 9 p.m. from 1953 to 1962. Several episodes were directed by William Conrad, Marshal Matt Dillon on radio's Gunsmoke and later the star of the CBS crime drama, Cannon. Like its preceding program, The McCoys, GE True faced opposition from the highly rated NBC western series, Bonanza. Reruns of the series were subsequently syndicated under the title True.

The replacement of the 900-series conventional, the W900 is produced as a Class 8 conventional-cab truck primarily for highway use. The \\"W\\" in its model designation denotes Worthington, one of the two founders of Kenworth. At its introduction, the W900 conventional was introduced alongside the K100 COE. As the Kenworth model line was expanded, the W900 became its flagship conventional, with its cab structure used across other model families; the model line competed against a wide variety of model lines through its production. In line with the Peterbilt 379 (from PACCAR sister division Peterbilt), the W900 gained a following among owner-operator drivers. The model line also became a popular basis for truck customization, with owners adding additional chrome trim, wheels, lighting, and paint. Introduced in 2018, the Kenworth W990 was developed to compliment the W900 line. The W900 is manufactured at Kenworth's main manufacturing facility in Renton, Washington.  Background  In 1956, Kenworth introduced the 900-series conventional-cab truck, replacing the 500-series introduced in 1939. As with its predecessor, the 900-series shared the chassis of the Kenworth cabover, replacing the \\"Bullnose\\" Kenworth COE with the Kenworth K100. As before, a side-opening \\"butterfly\\" hood was standard, but a forward tilting fiberglass hood became an option for the first time. In 1961, Kenworth introduced the W900 conventional as the replacement for the 900-series. As part of several major design changes, the cab was completely redesigned, raising the height of the cab roof and windows and mounting the two windshield panes together. To better allow for engine cooling, the radiator was widened slightly, with the tilting hood made standard. While the headlights remained fender-mounted, the housings were faired into the fenders.  Model overview  For 59 years, Kenworth produced three basic versions of the W900 model family. The \\"narrow-hood\\" W900 was produced from 1961 to 1966 and the \\"wide hood\\" W900A was produced from 1967 to 1982. From 1982 to 2020, Kenworth produced the W900B (later dropping the \\"B\\"). Alongside the standard W900B, an extended-hood W900L was introduced in 1989. The sloped-hood W900S was introduced in 1987; the W900S is similar to the T800, except for its set- forward front axle.  W900 (1961-1966)  In contrast to the 900-series and 500-series Kenworth conventionals, the cab introduced \\"bulkhead-style\\" doors (with full-length hinges). In another change, the roof panel was changed from metal to fiberglass. While functionally different, the W900 retained the wide- style vent windows, with door handles mounted below the windows.  W900A (1967-1982)  In 1967, the W900 underwent its first major change and was renamed the W900A. To accommodate larger diesel engines, the hood was widened several inches to further increase radiator size. For 1972, the doors of the W900 were changed, with the model adapting larger windows, narrower vent windows; for ease of use, the door handles were re-positioned to the bottom of the doors and changed from a lever-style to a pull-style configuration. In 1973, the Kenworth badging was changed, with a redesigned grille emblem and hood badging. In 1974, a 60-inch flattop double sleeper was introduced as a factory option. In 1976, Kenworth introduced the Aerodyne sleeper cab for the W900A. Distinguished by its twin skylight windows, Aerodyne was the first factory-produced sleeper cab with a raised roof. After the 1982 introduction of the W900B, the W900 continued production in Mexico (Kenmex), adopting the latter model's rectangular headlamps.  W900B (1982-present)  During 1982, Kenworth introduced the W900B as a replacement for the W900A. While largely distinguished by its introduction of rectangular headlamps (though round headlamps initially remained an option), the W900B underwent further modification. To further accommodate increased engine cooling, the hoodline was raised, requiring the cab to be mounted higher on the frame. Since the introduction of the W900B, Kenworth has introduced two variants of the W900. In 1987, the W900S was introduced, adopting the sloped hood of the T800. In 1990, the W900L was introduced as a longer version, extending the BBC from 120 to 130 inches. Initially produced as a limited edition (to commemorate the W900B model's appearance in Licence to Kill), the W900L went from becoming a limited edition to a full production vehicle. From the 1990s onward, the W900L would become one of the most popular vehicles sold by Kenworth. Since the introduction of the W900S and W900L, along with changes to the powertrain to comply with upgraded emissions standards, several functional changes have been made to the W900B. In late 1994, the Aerocab/Aerodyne2 became an option for the W900B and W900L; also shared with the T600B. The Aerocab featured a raised roof and a full-width curved windscreen (in one-piece or two-piece configurations); on standard-configuration day cabs, the two-piece flat windshield remains available. On day-cab configurations, the Aerocab roof design introduced an extended-BBC configuration. In 1998, the 86-inch Studio Sleeper was introduced as an option, easily one of the largest factory- produced sleeper cabs ever produced. In 2006, the curved windshield became available on the W900S for the first time. = 1998-2020 sleeper configurations = * 86 in Studio Sleeper (218.44 cm) * 72 in Aerocab Flattop (182.88 cm) * 62 in Aerocab Flattop (157.48 cm) * 38 in Aerocab Flattop Sleeper (91.44 cm) File:Kenworth W900 (33058753583).jpgPre-1967 W900 (updated doors) File:Kenworth W900A, J.Dixon Plant Hire (Ireland).jpg1972 W900A File:Kenworth W900 in pink and white (Garten Trucking, CT).jpg1973-1982 W900A daycab File:Haycock Petroleum Kenworth W900L tanker (2).jpgEarly 2000s W900B Aerocab low-roof sleeper File:Kenworth W900S concrete truck.jpgPre-2006 W900S File:Bakersfield, (CA) Truck Kenworth at Flying J Travel Plaza (4).jpgW900L with Aerodyne Studio Sleeper  Variants  Structurally, the W900 shares commonality with a wide variety of Kenworth trucks produced in North America through a wide variety of applications.  K100 (1961-2004)  In 1961, Kenworth introduced the K100 cabover model line alongside the W900 conventional (\\"K\\" standing for Kent, the first half of Kenworth). While using a different frame and cab, the K100 models shared similar build characteristics with the W900s and other models, such as free-fit bolted frames, and bulkhead doors with piano-style hinges. As length restriction regulations were liberalized in North America in the early 1980s, the demand for cabover-style semitractors fell sharply, with the K100E ending production in 2004. After its discontinuation in the North America, the K100 remained in production in Australia until 2011, when it was replaced by the K200. While structurally similar to the K100, the Kenworth K200 features a redesigned interior and exterior.  C500 (1972-present)  Introduced in 1972, the Kenworth C500 is marketed nearly exclusively in severe-service configurations. Sharing its cab with the W900, the C500 uses a model-specific chassis, offered with multiple axle configurations (including versions with twin steer axles).  T600 (1985-2007)  Introduced for 1985, the Kenworth T600 is the first aerodynamically-enhanced semitractor, with a sloped hood, skirted lower body, and bodywork that closely integrates the front fenders and bumper. Sharing the cab and frame of the W900, the T600 differs largely with its radically sloped hood, set-back front axle, and air cleaners set under the hood. Although marketed alongside the W900 for its entire production run, the T600 was not developed as its successor; during the development of the T600, Kenworth achieved over 20% better fuel economy (compared to the W900). Following the introduction of the T600, Kenworth would debut a wide variety of sloped-hood trucks based on the T600 and W900, including the T400 regional tractor, T800 heavy-duty truck (which currently remains in production), along with medium duty trucks (the T300, followed by the T170/T270/T370/T470). While featuring changes to its front bodywork, suspension, and frame, the 2008-2017 Kenworth T660, which replaced the T600, shares cab/sleeper commonality with its predecessor and the W900. Through the late 1980s and 1990s, as a response to the success of the Kenworth T600, other North American truck manufacturers would introduce aerodynamically enhanced semitractors of their own, with the Ford Aeromax, International 9400, and Peterbilt 377 conventionals entering production along with the Peterbilt 372 and Freightliner Argosy cabovers.

Each model line was produced with 50 VIT vehicles, with each named for a different U.S. state. One of the first Kenworth vehicles fitted with a stand- up Aerodyne sleeper cab (allowing for double beds and clothes closets), the interior was fitted with nearly every available option available on a Kenworth, including refrigerators and hot plates. While the 1976 VIT is a limited edition vehicle, the VIT name remains in use by Kenworth to denote its highest-trim interior configurations.  007 Limited Edition (1989)  In 1989, a W900B appeared in the James Bond movie Licence to Kill. To showcase its appearance, Kenworth produced a \\"007 Limited Edition\\" option package for the W900B. Adopting the same paint livery as the W900B from the movie, the option package was available for any version of the W900B, marking the introduction of the \\"Extended Hood\\" option. Along with the specific livery, the option package featured several distinctive features, including gold- plated Kenworth badging, and James Bond \\"007\\" emblems. The interior featured a number of electronics features, including a TV/VCR combination, cassette player, CD player (with CDs including soundtracks from James Bond movies), and an 8-speaker, 300-watt sound system. Coinciding with the 007 Limited Edition, the Extended Hood option was offered to all versions of the W900B, becoming the 130-inch BBC W900L.  ICON900 (2015)  On the 25th anniversary of the W900L a limited edition model was released: the ICON900. This model is available in limited production numbers and comes with nearly the entire catalog of chrome \\"brightwork\\" as well as unique badges to distinguish itself from the standard W900L.  Appearances in media  Through its half-century of production, the Kenworth W900 and its many variants have appeared numerous times on film and television. One of the most famous appearances of the model line is in the 1977 film Smokey and the Bandit (alongside the Pontiac Trans Am). Of the three W900As driven by Jerry Reed, one example is a 1973; two are from 1974. The W900L effectively made its debut in the 1989 James Bond film License to Kill; initially offered as a limited edition commemorating the film, the extended-length configuration became a full-scale production option. In television, the W900 was centrally featured in a number of appearances. Claude Akins appeared in a two-tone green 1974 W900A in the series Movin' On. The W900 appeared in the French educational television program C'est pas sorcier.

There is a possibility that Cleopatra could have been a daughter of a local noble from Jerusalem. She was born and raised in the city and could have been of Jewish or Edomite-Phoenician origins.

Ljubljana: Slovenska akademija znanosti in umetnosti, p. 67. The Slovene name is borrowed from the Middle High German prepositional phrase ze Erngruben, literally 'at Erngrub'. The German name is a compound of ern 'to plow (up)' or erde '(fertile) soil' + gruobe 'depression, basin' and may refer to a mammoth rib dug up at the site (now hanging in the church), to a robber's hideout in a cave, or to the small fertile valley where the settlement is located. For similar Slovene geographical names based on foreign-language prepositional phrases of location, compare Cmurek, Cven, Dragonja, Sostro, and Spuhlja. In the past the German name was Ehrengruben. History Crngrob was recorded in documents from the 13th century onward. Much of the history of the village is dominated by that of its church. During the Second World War, German forces attached the Partisan Selca Company above the village on 27 March 1942. Fifteen Partisans were killed in the attack.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1968.

The first mention of a church at this site dates to the late 13th century. In the 14th century it was expanded, and after 1410 a southern arcade was built. In the mid-15th century a third aisle was added and in 1551 the belfry was heightened and in 1661 its onion-shaped dome was built. Its characteristic neogothic columned porch was erected in 1858.Slovenian National Tourist Association site The church's artwork includes a painting of Holy Sunday from the workshop of Johannes of Ljubljana (ca. 1460), a Gothic painting of Saint Christopher on the south wall from 1464, a painting of Saint Christopher on the bell tower, and remnants of frescoes from the 14th and 15th centuries on the north wall of the nave. There are four 17th-century gilded altars where the nave meets the chancel; above the altar dedicated to Saint Martin there hangs a whale rib, referred to as the rib of a giantess in popular tradition. The main altar was created in 1652 by the Ljubljana sculptor Jurij Skarnos and was gilded by Jakob Jam≈°ek of ≈†kofja Loka. The forged railing in front of the main altar was created by the ≈†kofja Loka locksmith Gregor Jesenko. The Baroque organ, work by the organ builder Joannes Franciscus Janecheck, dates to 1743. The church was a popular pilgrimage destination in the past, and so there are many wayside shrines along the routes leading to the church. The Red Shrine stands along the road to ≈†kofja Loka. It has frescoes from the 16th century and is one of the oldest shrines in Slovenia. The Oman Chapel-Shrine near the woods contains an 18th- century carving by a peasant artist, and below the church there is another chapel-shrine from the 18th century that was painted by Anton Tu≈°ek.

It was built in 1853 by the North London Railway. Bow railway works was built by the North London Railway in 1853 on a site which also included a sizeable wagon repair shop, under the direction of William Adams the locomotive superintendent. At first it was used for the repair of locomotives purchased from outside contractors, but from 1860 it was enlarged to enable it to undertake locomotive construction. The first locomotive completed was 4-4-0T No. 43 which incorporated the Adams bogie, to improve high-speed stability. The last steam locomotive to be built at Bow was 4-4-0T No. 4 in 1906.Larkin (1992), p. 30 A new erecting shop was built in 1882 under Adams' successor J.C. Park, who continued producing 4-4-0 and 0-6-0 tank engines for the railway. At its height the workshops were employing 750 men. Between 1879 and 1901, thirty 0-6-0 tanks designed by J.C.Park were built, of which fourteen lasted until British Railways ownership, the last being taken out of service in 1958 some seventy years old. Merger and grouping In 1908 the North London Railway was merged with the London and North Western Railway, and thereafter the works reverted to locomotive repairs. The North London Railway line was included in the L.N.W.R. electrification scheme between 1914 and 1923. The L.N.W.R. was in turn grouped with other railways in North west England and Scotland to form the London Midland and Scottish Railway on 1 January 1923. Bow works was then the smallest of fifteen workshops owned by that company, but was one of the newest and best equipped. From 1927 it also became responsible for repairs to locomotives from the former London, Tilbury and Southend Railway following the closure of the repair facility at Plaistow. In the 1930s the works developed and manufactured the Hudd automatic train warning system for the L.T.S.R., which later led to a British Railways (BR) team from the national headquarters setting up in Bow to develop BR's standard Automatic Warning System. The workshop, was badly damaged during the blitz and the wagon workshop destroyed. In 1956 the workshop repaired diesel-electric locomotives for the nearby motive power depot at Devons Road (the first in the U.K. to become all- diesel). The works closed in 1960, and the workload was transferred to Derby Works.

Many of the classical practices were well documented at the time by Greek or Roman physicians, and some therapies have originated from Cyprus itself. Primitive medicine Medical practice in ancient Cyprus is believed to reflect general medical principles from Ancient Greece and the Middle East. Local doctors were commonly using frankincense, myrrh, olive oil, resins from trees, wormwood, bitter herbs in water, and mandrake. Trepanning of the skull was also in use (a technique used since 10000 BC.Paul Astrom. Hala Sultan Tekke vol 8;1983 This was thought to release the ‚Äòbad spirits‚Äô and was used in epilepsy, headaches and head injuries. They used a famous ‚Äòpoultice of figs‚Äô to cure boils and the local healers had a concept of cleaning, washing and disinfecting the water. Common diseases in Cyprus were those in every Mediterranean country, namely food poisoning, sun stroke, tuberculosis and polio. Drought affected the water supplies making the water poisonous. Other common diseases were leprosy, skin infections, boils, eye infections (due to dust and flies), fractures and injuries. Epidemics such as bubonic plague were common. Many believed that healing was possible by believing in God, and the healers used special rituals, charms and incantations. The sick were looked after in local sanctuaries, under the care of priests.Madga Ohnefalsch- Richter. Griechische Sitten und Gebrauche auf Cypern, Berlin 1913 The Myceneans (c1500 BC) believed that any god could cause a disease. Apollo and Artemis could shoot arrows to cause diseases, whereas other gods could cause ageing. They believed that Thymos was the life force present in all living organisms, Psyche was the soul, and the heart was where consciousness was located. They knew that the heart is a beating organ, and that the throat carried food to the stomach.Theodoros Loukaides, Medicine in Ancient Cyprus, Cyprus medical Journal 1953, vol VI, no3-4 Medicine was practiced by healers, who treated wounds in battle, and by the Physicians, who treated any other disease. Their position in the society was lower than nobility and higher than craftsmen. They used a variety of surgical instruments, as well as medicinal plants and ointments. Phoenicians (900‚Äì800 BC) The Phoenician goddess of pregnancy was Astarte (also called Astoreth), goddess of fertility, nutrition and gynaecology, identified with Aphrodite. Astarte was worshipped in Kition (present day Larnaca). She was married to the Middle Eastern god Baal who was also worshipped in Kition. Bronze snakes (medical symbols) were found near where their temple was believed to be. It is known that during the 5th century BC, the Phoenicians were making false teeth. Doctors were making the drugs themselves and had fixed charges for each drug.Marios Kyriazis, Medicine in Ancient Kition and Old Larnaca. Larnaca Municipality 2001 Several inscriptions referring to Apollo Amyklos, the god of healing, were found mainly near Kition. A doctor mentioned by name was Onasilaos. He was a military doctor living in Idalhion (present day Dali village). Together with his two brothers, probably male nurses, treated the injured in a battle against the MIDI. Originally the Cypriots were vegetarians consuming no meat at all, as it was forbidden to sacrifice living animals. With time, they began sacrificing living animals, believing in the concept of ‚Äòa soul for a soul‚Äô (psychi anti psychis), and burned the animal after the sacrifice. According to legend, during a sacrificial burning one day, a piece of flesh accidentally fell on the floor and the priest picked it up quickly and put it back on the altar, but he burned his fingers in the process. He put his fingers in his mouth instinctively to soothe the burn. He liked the taste of the juices and he then decided to eat the meat. He was punished for this, but others followed in his steps and eventually the Cypriots became meat eaters.Asclipiades the Cypriot, Archaia Kypros Eis Tas Ellinicas Pegas vol 3, Medicine Greeks (460‚Äì357 BC) The vaginal speculum was first used in ancient Greece and some contemporary specula were found in Cyprus. A pure gold otoscope, very similar to those commonly used in the 1930s was also found.Ar. Kouzi History of Medicine, Athens 1929 A known doctor of the period was Diagoras the Cypriot (3rd century BC). He was mentioned by Dioscorides with regards to opium use, also by Pliny,Plini Secundi: Naturalis Historiae ed Car. Mayhoff, Lipsiae, Teubneri and Erotianus. Diagoras was famous outside Cyprus. He was specifically interested in pharmacology and he devised the ‚ÄòGreat Collirio‚Äô used for burns, exophthalmos, keratitis, eye ache (ponommatos), and discharge from the eye. The Collirio was also used to cure headache, with the addition of opium into the mixture. In the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia there is a stone ring with the inscription 'Diagorou', and the head of the medusa. According to legend, Athena gave to Asclepius the blood from the medusa, believed to have healing properties. Material used by Greek physicians:Neoclis Kyriazis, Medicine in Cyprus (Iatriki en Kypro) Kypriaca Chronica 1923 1:177 * Honey, which is antibacterial. It works because it is hypertonic, so it draws water from the bacteria. Honey contains inhibine which is involved in a reaction producing hydrogen peroxide (antiseptic), and contains propolis with known antibacterial activity. * Fat used as antibacterial, also for making ointments * The white milk of figs, used as anticoagulant - to stop hemorrhage * Frankincense (Livani), is an antiseptic * Zinc (abundant in Cyprus) was heated to produce zinc carbonate and zinc hydro silicate called Cadmian Earth, and stirred with reed (kalami) to make \\"calamine\\" lotion. This, as today, is used for treating wounds, drying wet skin, ulcers and general skin antiseptic. * Vinegar, as acetic acid, is an antiseptic, also active against pseudomonas * Dung used as wound healer, as it contains anti-inflammatory enzymes * Myrrh was used on wounds, for enema, on burns. It is bacteriostatic against Gram positive bacteria * Theriac, contains opium and snake flesh, was used for many ailments including snake bites * Wine, kills Vibrio cholerae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Proteus, and Pseudomonas. It contains alcohol and anthocyanidins. It was used generously because its power is short-lived. * Rust from oxidized iron was used to cure wounds, and in water, against anaemia * Terminthos (trimithia) helped in urinary problems, against indigestion, and in hair loss * Kalamos (kalami) (arundo donax) its roots were used for pain and its green leaves as anti- inflammatory. The outside shell mixed with vinegar was used for alopecia * Fragrant plants (mint, lavender, bay leaves) were used as antiseptics * Melanthion (mavrokoccos) (nigella sativa) was used to improve the appetite and for stomach problems, as well as for neuralgias and pain, urinary problems and insect bites. Apollo Melanthios, also called Opaon Melanthios, was worshipped all over Cyprus * Salt (from the local salt lakes). PlinyPlini Secundi: Naturalis Historiae ed Car. Mayhoff, Lipsiae, Teubneri wrote: \\"the salt of Kitium is very good...\\" Salt was used for cleaning wounds and stopping hemorrhage, insect or snake bites, fungal infections. This was used both in antiquity and in contemporary popular medicine. Ancient Cypriot Doctors Apollodoros of Kition, recommended radish seeds in water against poisoning. He wrote 'Peri Myron Ke Stefanon' (On Perfumes and Wreaths) where he recommended rose wreaths for headaches. He also wrote 'Peri Thirion' (On Beasts). Pliny and Dioscorides wrote extensively about him, praising his abilities.Dioscorides Anazarbei de Materia Medica Berolini 1918 Synesis the Cypriot (4th century BC) mentioned by Aristotle,Aristotelis:Opera Omnia, Lipsiae 1884 must have been famous. He was also mentioned as Synesios. The most famous doctor of the time was Apollonios of Kition (1st century BC).Neoclis Kyriazis. Medicine in Cyprus, Kypriaka Chronica vol A, 1923 p76 He was known as the Cypriot Hippocrates and wrote many medical books. His most well known was ‚ÄòOn Joints‚Äô (Peri Arthron), comments on treatment of joint injuries, based on Hippocrates.Hippocratis: Opera Omnia ed Kuhn, vol XII, Lipsiae 1826 Zeno of Cyprus (361 AD) founded a medical school in Alexandria. His student was Oribasius. The Emperor Julian wrote: ‚Äò... you are not an ordinary doctor, but a teacher also‚Äô. He was very experienced both in the theory and practice of medicine.Neoclis Kyriazis Kypriaka Chronica p75 1923, March He wrote many books, none of which has survived. Other doctors were: Apollonides, Onasilaos, Oktaousios, Ktisias Knidios, Paion of Amathus, Leonidas Skythinou, Nouminios Solevs, Phedas Damassagorou Byzantines The influence of Byzantion in Cyprus lasted from 647 AD to 1191 AD. Byzantine medicine was based on common sense rather than scientific ideas. Byzantine physicians supported Christian philanthropy, with development of hospitals and organisations (nosokomeia, xenones), for the first time in medical history. They offered treatment to all patients regardless of social or economic position. During this period there was an increasing reliance on cures by Saints. Traditional medicine (iatrosofia) becomes established.Neoclis KyriazisTheurapeutics in Cyprus. Elephtheria, 13/26 March 1910 Examples of treatments are: santalon (a light stone) is used for mumps, boils and tonsillitis. They rubbed it on a wet clay pot (couza), and spread the resulting mud on the boil. For earache they used warm olive oil and for trachoma they washed the eyes with urine or sambuca.Iatrosoficon, Holy Monastery of Macheras, Nicosia 1924 The mammouthes (practical nurses) assisted during childbirth, and also used cupping (cazia) and venesection (vlotomes). A local proverb for those who react excessively to a small problem, is \\"apou poni vathkia vlootoma\\" (he who has pain, venesects deeply).Chronicles of Macheras A. Pavlides. Second Edition, Nicosia 1995 Also mentioned was a Byzantine trick: \\"In order to seduce a man put a few drops of menstrual blood in his coffee.\\"Andreas Georgiathis. Gastria- Patriki:Nicosia 1992 Lusignians (1192-1473) Doctors were allowed to practice only after permission from bishops and other more senior doctors.Kypros Chrisanthis. From the History of Cypriot Medicine, Nicosia 1983 Ignorance and malpractice where punished, sometimes by death. The Lusignians used affumications, herbs, astrology, venesections, cautery, purging, and pilgrimages to the saints. A surgeon was locally called 'surgentis', the hospital 'spitalli' and the midwives 'mammouthes', who also performed virginity examinations. A medical doctor was called ‚Äòdoctor of physic‚Äô as opposed to a surgeon. The chemist was called 'myropsios'. Mastre (Magistro) was a title given to doctors, as well as to chief musicians (hence ‚ÄòMaestro‚Äô), chief builders (hence ‚ÄòMaster‚Äô) and army officials. A physician known as Mastre Gky (c1300), was probably Dr Guido de Pagnolo, an Italian living in Cyprus and personal friend of Petrarch. King Pier I of France, sent Mastre Gky to Genova as an emissary to mediate and try to find a compromise on several political issues between the Genoese and Franks. He was successful and he was said to have achieved 'real and firm' cooperation. This indicates that some doctors had heavy political involvement in the government. Other doctors were Mastre Pier Vryonas, Mastre Gabriel Zintilis, and Mastre Synglitikos, all believed to be of Greek Cypriot origin. Curing saints were very in demand, particularly by the lower social classes. The higher classes paid for qualified doctors. For example, The historian Macheras says that St Mamas is 'miraculous all over the world, and if I was going to write about his cures, I wouldn't be able to do it while alive\\". Other saints were thought to cure fever, malaria, sciatica etc. Examples of epidemics:Neoclis Kyriazis Kypriaka Chronica 1931 Year H, vol 2 * 1348 Epidemic (plague?). \\"God sent a great death because we are sinners, half of the island died\\". * 1409 Great epidemic (‚ÄòMega Thanatico‚Äô) * 1470 Plague, lasted three years and killed 75% of the inhabitants. Venetians (1489-1570) Cyprus depended on the ‚ÄòConsiglio Maggiore di Venezia‚Äô. The government paid the salary of some doctors, whereas others were private. There were doctors, midwives and practical doctors, who were practicing venesection, cautery, purging, and sniffing. Two doctors are mentioned by name: Bulien de Nores from a baronial family, and Jane de Rames (1489‚Äì1571). The latter was born in Cyprus but also lived and practised in Padova. The local Cypriots requested a doctor from Venice and he was sent by the Venetian government. His salary was 300 ducats a year, quite high for a doctor. In general, the Christian doctors were better paid than the Jews. Turks (1571-1878) In Cyprus there were too many sick people due to the frequent malaria epidemics, and too few doctors. Qualified doctors were working well and paid well. In addition, doctors were selling drugs for extra income. The first doctor of that period was Aloise Cucci (1625). He was an Italian who lived in Cyprus, a well-informed and wise doctor. There were many others mentioned by name, both Cypriot and French. Examples are: Dr Dimanel and Dr Dende (c1705) were ‚ÄòDocteurs de Nation Fran√ßaise‚Äô. They were recorded in certificates in from the French embassy in Cyprus. Dr Guerin and Dr Donde (c1730) were surgeons who prepared a perfumed concoction to disinfect the house when somebody died. Xatzi Georgios X Liasi Chalepli 1742 was a Cypriot, born in Beirut, but lived and practiced in Larnaca. Dr Gerolamo Varlamo (Varlaam) (1770) had the qualification ‚ÄòDottore Veneto di Medicina‚Äô. From Venice he came to Cyprus through Corfu. He studied in Padova. Drs Giuseppe Zambelli and Francesco A Patriarca (1794), from Naples, were working in Famagusta and then in Larnaca. They had a written agreement to work together as partners in medicine and surgery, and to share the income for 10 years. Memorial plate Dr Foblant at St. Joseph's Convent in Larnaca Dr Kostandinos Valsamaki (Varsamas) (1779) He was a descendant of Balsamina Doukaina, Iakobos Gabras, Alexandros Tsaphas Argyros. was married to the daughter of Dr Vondiziano. He studied in Padova. His son Pavlos was also a doctor and was charging 8 piastres for a home visit, and 18 for a consultation with other doctors. Was the first community physician in 1837. Their descendants moved to Greece. Dr Oben (Aubin, 1817) a Frenchman. He was requesting to become ‚ÄòOfficier de Sant√© de la Nation Fran√ßaise‚Äô i.e. government doctor. It is recorded that he diagnosed the plague on a patient, who also had anthrax. Christoforo Castellani (1821) was an Italian, private physician to Kutchuk Mehmet, Governor of Cyprus. The French Dr Joseph Irene Foblant 1839 was said that he used to put a coin under the pillow of poor patients, so that they could buy food. Pavlos Pieridis Picozis (1815‚Äì1865), studied at the University of Edinburgh and was the personal physician to the governor of Cyprus. Dr Antonios Tsepis (1868) was a Greek doctor who settled in Larnaca. He was in charge of the quarantine 1883‚Äì1905. Dr Thrasyvoulos Ropas (1870) was also a military doctor. He was a very good physician, but it was said that he was an eccentric and a humorist. He was announcing the deaths of his patients for his own advertisement. Frederic Charles Heidenstam (1876), who was a Swede, came to Cyprus and became chief medical officer in 1882. Neoclis Kyriazis (1877), was a municipal doctor and historian. From the decade commencing in 1830 both Muslim and Christian citizens of Cyprus became increasingly aware of the need to control public health. An example is the fundraising in Larnaca in order to fund an institution to control disease outbreaks imported from shipping through the port. In 1835 the first Quarantine in Larnaca received bi-communal funding; however the Quarantine in Limassol did not open until 1845, and was a Christian-only initiative. Coincidental to the local efforts, the Ottoman Sultan ordered the establishment of port Quarantines throughout the Ottoman Empire. Nonetheless, there was, to all intents and purposes, no functioning state medical system in Cyprus under Ottoman rule. There are reports of a Turkish military hospital near the Paphos gate in Nicosia; the only other hospital facility recorded in this period was the House of the Nuns in Larnaca. This was founded in 1844 and provided free healthcare until its closure in 1922 (Reference 21). At the time, there were also plans to create the post of a municipal doctor. The major cities of Cyprus were full of prostitutes to cater for the needs of the newly arrived British soldiers. This led to an increase of sexually transmitted diseases. The municipalities used to keep a record and photographs of the prostitutes, asking them to have frequent medical examinations.  British (1879-1960)  The first few decades of British coincided with an era of medical and scientific advances throughout the empire. Cyprus benefited both indirectly and directly: the new colonial outpost provided jobs for British doctors and nurses, but the British also encouraged indigenous Cypriots to pursue medical careers. Thus saying, during this period even Cypriot medical staff were trained off-island. The first formal hospital was created in Larnaca in 1879 and the first doctor was Dr Heidenstam. His salary was ¬£50 a year. In 1881 the hospital had 113 inpatients and 3485 outpatients. This was housed in some small buildings in the centre of the town and was locally called ‚Äòta spitouthkia tous arostous‚Äô (the little houses of the sick).

Life Alphonse Lemerre's publisher's mark Alphonse Lemerre was the eighth child of his parents. In 1850, at age 12, he was an errand-boy in Saint-L√¥. In 1860, he moved to Paris and quickly rose to prominence, becoming the \\"Prince de l'√©dition\\" (Prince of Publishing) and made his publisher's mark famous, which had the Latin motto Fac et spera (\\"Agis et esp√®re\\" in French, \\"Do and Hope\\" in English). He opened a library at 23 passage Choiseul. His library occupied also other odd number addresses (23-33, 47). In 1865, he began to edit Parnassian poets in Louis-Xavier de Ricard's revue L'Art, which had ten issues between November 2, 1865, and January 6, 1866. The November issue had an article by Paul Verlaine about Baudelaire. In 1866, Lemerre published Le Parnasse contemporain, a collection of new poetry, in 18 weekly installments from 30 March to 30 June 1866, the collected installments published in October. Two other volumes of Le Paranasse Contemporain appeared in 1871 and 1876. He went on to publish numerous collections. Lemerre's publications include many of the chefs-d'≈ìuvre of 19th century French literature and history: Anatole France, Auguste Molinier, Louis Petit de Julleville; la Petite Biblioth√®que litt√©raire, la Biblioth√®que des curieux, la Biblioth√®que illustr√©e, la Biblioth√®que dramatique, la Petite collection pour la jeunesse, les po√®mes nationaux, des livres d'enseignement and other collections.

V. RamasamyA biographical sketch (, ) (17 September 1879 ‚Äì 24 December 1973), also known as Ramaswami, EVR, Thanthai Periyar, or Periyar, was a Dravidian social reformer and politician from India, who founded the Self-Respect Movement and Dravidar Kazhagam.Thakurta, Paranjoy Guha and Shankar Raghuraman (2004) A Time of Coalitions: Divided We Stand, Sage Publications. New Delhi, p. 230. He advocated for the rights of women and was considered ahead of his time as well as controversial. Throughout the Indian sub-continent today, women continue to be marginalized in various ethnic and religious groups. During the early part of the twentieth century there have been many agitations against British rule (external) and injustices committed amongst the people of the sub-continent (internal). With all this, women's rights have been left in the dark. Periyar stated that, \\"political reformers are agitating that the privilege of administering \\"India\\" should go to \\"Indians\\". Social reformers are agitating that communal divisions and differences should be done away with. But nobody takes notice of the great hardship suffered by one section of women. Intelligent people will agree that the creator has not endowed men and women with different faculties. There are, in both men and women, intellectuals, courageous people, as well as stupid and cowardly people. While this is the case, it is unfair and wicked on the part of the haughty male population to continue to denigrate and enslave the female population.Veeramani, K. (1992) Periyar on Women's Rights. Emerald Publishers: Madras, p. 27. Periyar has explained that it is extremely cruel on the part of the Hindu brethren to witness the gradual destruction suffered by one half of their society, without taking any action. This apart, men and women are both human beings. The difference in physical features will not change the human quality. The difference in intellect and physical strength which we find among men can be found among women also. Practice improves the position equally in both men and women. Just as there are foolish people, weaklings and people with bad qualities among men, among women also there are likely to be people belonging to these categories.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 55. Marriages With regards to marriage, Periyar has stated that it is one of the worst customs in India. He claimed that the marriage principle, briefly, involves the enslavement of a woman by her husband and nothing else. This enslavement is concealed under the cover of marriage rites to deceive the women concerned by giving the wedding the false name of a divine function.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 69. There have been numerous papers in South India reporting how husbands have killed their wives, suspecting immoral behavior. The husband's suspicion of his wife's character has often led to murders. Those who believe in the divine dispensation, according to Periyar, do not have the knowledge to ask themselves why marriages conducted according to religious rites and the approval of God end in this fashion. Periyar further states that the very idea that the only proper thing for women to do is to be slaves of domesticity, bear children and bring them up, is a faulty one. As long as these restrictions are imposed on women, we can be sure that women have to be subservient to men and depend on men for help. If women have to live on terms of equality with men, they must have the liberty, like men, to have the kind of education they like and also to do unhampered, any work suitable to their knowledge, ability and taste.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 72. Furthermore, Periyar objected to terms like \\"giving of a maid\\" and \\"given in marriage\\". They are, \\"Sanskrit terms\\" and treat woman as a thing. He advocated the substitution of the word for marriage taken from the Tirukkual \\"Valkai thunai\\" or \\"life partner\\". Expenses With marriage comes the expenses. Periyar stated that in our country, and particularly in Hindu society, a marriage is a function causing a lot of difficulties and waste to all people concerned. But those who conduct the marriage function and those who are getting married do not appear to notice the attendant difficulties because they think that social life necessitates wasteful expense and many difficulties and therefore they must necessarily face those inconveniences and hardships.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 17. Wedding feast, jewels, expensive clothes, procession, pandal, dance, music‚Äîmoney is spent on all these to satisfy the vanity of the organizers. Whatever may be the amount of money spent on the wedding and however pompous each of the items may be, the mirth and jollity associated with these are over in two or three days. In a week's time the prestige and honor connected with these are forgotten. But the wedding expenses leave many families crushed; for many poor families these expenses leave an enormous burden and the debts remain uncleared for a number of years.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, pp. 17 & 18. However, if the money intended for the wedding expense is not borrowed and belongs to either of the marriage parties, then that amount could be used by her to bring up her children and to educate them. Such a procedure would be highly beneficial to her.Keeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 19. Arranged marriages In South Asia we mostly hear of arranged marriages as part of custom, heritage, and religions. Periyar thought that the Aryan wedding methods were barbarous because of the Aryan religion and art: Vedas, Sastras, Puranas, and Epics belong to the barbaric age. He further stated that is the reason why their wedding methods involve the parents giving the girl, prostituting the girl children and some stranger carrying the girl away by force or stealth.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 21. Arranged marriages in general were meant to enable the couple to live together throughout life and derive happiness, satisfaction and a good reputation, even years after the sexual urge and sexual pleasure are forgotten.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 22. But, with the selfish manipulation of this pact, Periyar claimed that women find 'pleasure' in slavish marriage because they have been brought up by their parents without education, independence and self-respect and because they have been made to believe that marriage means subordination to males. The inclusion of such slavish women in the group of 'chaste' women is another lure to them, leading them to find pleasure in such marriages. Because a man is also married before he has understood the nature of life, its problems and its pleasures, he is satisfied with the slavish nature of the wife and the sexual pleasure she gives. If he finds any incompatibility, he adapts himself to his partner and the circumstances and puts up with his lot. Love marriages or Gandharva marriages Gandharva marriage is when two people fall in love at first sight culminating in a physical union. Gandharva marriages, claims Periyar, will suit only those who have no ideals in life. Such a wedding gives primacy to sexual union along and it is doubtful if it indicates an agreement between the couple for good life. Sexual compatibility alone does not ensure happy married life; the couple should be able to live together cheerfully. Suitability for life or living together can be determined only if the man and woman get used to the company of each other, and are satisfied with each other. Only then, they can enter into an agreement to live together. Periyar further states that Gandharva marriages can give pleasure only as long as there is lust and the ability to satisfy that lust. If there is no compatibility between the partners in other respects, such marriages end only in the enslavement of women. The lies of such women resemble the lives of bullocks which are tied to a cart, beaten up and made to labor endlessly until they die. Therefore, there is a proverb stating, \\"A deeply loving girl is unfit for family life; a suitable life partner is unfit for love.\\" Periyar believed that the agreement between partners to live together will constitute a better marriage than a love marriage. Self-respect marriages In a leading article of Viduthalai, Periyar states that a self-respect wedding is based on rationalism. Rationalism is based on the individual's courage. Some may have the courage to conduct it during the time which almanacs indicate as the time of the planet Rahu and that, particularly in the evening. Some others may have just enough daring to avoid the Brahmin priest and his mother tongue - the Sanskrit language.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 24. Some may feel nervous about not keeping the traditional lamp burning in broad daylight. Some others may have the rotten thought that conducting a wedding without 'mangala sutra' is disgraceful. Still, the self-respect weddings conducted during the past thirty years have some basic limits. They are: Brahmins and their mantras should be utterly avoided; meaningless rituals, piling mud pots, one on another, having the traditional lamp during day time, ritual smoke - all these should be avoided. Rationalism does not approve of these. Periyar then asks why can't the government pass an Act that legalizes weddings which avoid the above-mentioned superstitious practices. If all these details cannot be accommodated in the Act, the latter can legalize weddings which don't have Brahmin priests, the Sanskrit language and the so called holy fire.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 25. Thus, marriages styled as Self-Respect marriages carried a threefold significance: a) replacing the Purohit, b) inter-caste equality, c) man-woman equality. Periyar claimed to have performed Self-Respect marriages unofficially since 1925 and officially since 1928.Diehl, E.V. Ramasamy Naiker-Periyar, p. 32. Self-Respect marriages were legalized in 1967 by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Government.Diehl, E.V. Ramasamy Naiker-Periyar, pp. 32 & 33. Widow-remarriage On the remarriage of widows, Periyar states that among the atrocities perpetrated by the Hindu male population against women, here we have to consider the treatment meted out to widows alone. If a girl loses her husband, even before knowing anything of worldly pleasures, she is compelled to close her eyes to everything in the world and die broken-hearted. Even in Periyar's community at the time, there were widowed girls below the age of 13 years. Periyar stated how it is a touching sight to see the parents of those widowed children treating them like untouchables.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 30. He goes on to say that whatever may be the reason for the present state of the Hindu society, my firm belief that the low position given permanently to widows may prove to be the reason for the utter ruin of the Hindu religion and the Hindu society.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, pp. 30 & 31. If we try to find the reason for such conduct, we will have to conclude that they instinctively feel that women are slaves, subservient to men and that they must be kept under control. That is why these people treat women like animals. They seem to feel that giving freedom to women is equivalent to committing a very serious crime. The result of this attitude is that there is no independence or freedom to one half of the human race. This wicked enslavement of half of the human race is due to the fact that men are physically a little stronger than women. This principle applies to all spheres of life and the weaker are enslaved by the stronger. If slavery has to be abolished in society, the male arrogance and wickedness which lead to the enslavement of women must be abolished first. Only when this is achieved, the tender sprouts of freedom and equality will register growth.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 31. One of the reasons why Periyar hated Hinduism and the orthodoxy practiced in the name of Hinduism was the practice of child marriage. Many of the girl children who were married before they were ten or twelve years old became widows before they knew the meaning of the word. According to the 1921 All India Census the details of the child widows reported living in the country that time were as follows:Gopalakrishnan, Periyar: Father of the Tamil race, p. 30. *1 year baby widows - 497 *1 to 2 year child widows - 494 *2 to 3 year child widows - 1,257 *3 to 4 year child widows - 2,837 *4 to 5 year child widows - 6,707 *Total number of widows - 11,342 *5 to 10 year young widows - 85,037 *10 to 15 year young widows - 232,147 *15 to 20 year young widows - 396,172 *20 to 25 year young widows - 742,820 *25 to 30 year young widows - 1,163,720 *Total number of widows - 2,631,238Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 33. Periyar was deeply disturbed when he realized that among the widows in India, 11,892 were little children below 5 years and that young widows below 15 years numbering 232,147 were denied the pleasures of life.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, pp. 33 & 34. With regards to the re-marriage of widows, Periyar stated that it is the practice of our people to refer to such a wedding as \\"a widow's marriage\\". Such an expression is used only with reference to women and in connection with men. Just as this lady is marrying another husband after the death of the first husband, many men marry again after the death of the first wife. But the second marriage of a man is not referred to as \\"a widower's marriage\\", though that is the proper thing to do. Periyar himself was a widower. After becoming one, he took a second wife. He claimed that in the ancient days, both men and women in the country had this practice. There were numerous instances in sastras and puranas of women getting married again after the death of their first husband. Periyar further stated that this is not an unusual practice in the rest of the world though it might appear strange for us at the present time. Christian and Muslim women marry again after the death of the first husband. 90 percent of women in Muslim countries get married again soon after the death of the first husband. This may be unusual in certain sections of Indian societies. But it is a common practice in certain other sections of our society which are called very backward communities.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 39. Further, inter-caste marriages and remarriage of widows are on the increase in India. Brahmins oppose these because they are afraid that they cannot exploit the people any more in the name of sastras. For the same reason they oppose the Sharada Act which is necessary for social well-being.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 77. Child marriage In all the meetings of the non-Brahmins and the Self-Respectors, Periyar condemned child marriages and emphasized the need for educating all girl children and giving right to young widows to get married again. Periyar has been very much against child marriage and stated that it reflects the cruelty to which innocent girls were subjected by their well-meaning parents. Periyar asked that if these parents can be considered civilized in any sense of the term. There was no other leader other than Periyar who reacted against this practice of child marriage. Those who supported child marriage were strongly against Periyar's condemnation of this act. Take for example, the Sharada Act. Those who opposed this Act say that it was against the Sastras to conduct the marriage of a girl after she has attained puberty. They further say that those who conduct such marriages are committing a sin and therefore will go to hell.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 37. Chastity Periyar claimed that \\"household duties\\" have risen out of the foolishness of people and were not natural duties.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 56. He went on to say that it was our selfish greed which has multiplied our household work. Nobody need worry that without household work, the women will lose their \\"chastity\\". On chastity, Periyar went on to say that it is something that belongs to women and is not a pledge to men. Whatever, chastity is, it was something that belonged to individuals. In society, it was believed that if people lose their chastity, they will get divine punishment. Others are not going to get that punishment. Referring to the doctrines of institutionalized orthodox religions, he went on to say that men need not to worry themselves that women are committing a sin by not doing household work. Thus, let men realize that women are not slaves and that men are not their masters or guardians. Women should be allowed to develop the competence to protect themselves and their chastity and men need not be their watchdogs. He also believed that it was derogatory for men to play such a role. It was said by the orthodox that women will develop diseases if they lose their chastity. The disease that a woman gets affects the husbands also. If we educate the women, they will develop the capability to keep themselves and their husbands pure. Thus, Periyar stated in the Kudi Arasu for the society to think deeply about taking a decision and do the right thing for their sisters and girl children.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 41. Periyar kindled the thoughts of everybody by also ridiculing the use of the word chastity only with reference to women. (Periyar-Father of Tamil 32) He stated that character is essential for both men and women and that speaking of chastity only with reference to women degraded not merely women but men also. He extended this thought and said that in any sphere of activity, civilized society cannot think of one law for men and another for women. He also said that the way most men treated their women was far worse than the way the upper class people treated the lower class, the way in which rich men treated the poor and the way in which a master treated his slave.Gopalakrishnan, M.D. (1991) Periyar: Father of the Tamil race, Chennai. Emerald Publishers, p. 32. Education On education, Periyar stated that some foolish parents believe that if girls get educated, they will correspond with their secret lovers. That it is a very foolish and mischievous notion. No parent need be anxious about it. If a girl writes a letter, it will only be to a male. We can even now caution men not to read any love letter addressed to them by a woman and, even if they read it, not to reply to it. If men do not listen to this advice, they, as well as the girls who write them must be punished. It will be a hopelessly bad thing, if parents keep their girl children uneducated for this reason. At a speeched delivered by Periyar at the Prize Distribution function in the Municipal School for Girls at Karungal Palayam, Erode, he stated that girl children should be taught active and energetic exercises like running, high jump, long jump,and wrestling so that they may acquire the strength and courage of men. Their time and energy should not be wasted in light pastimes like Kummi (groups going in a circle, clapping their hands rhythmically) and in Kolatam (striking with sticks rhythmically). In ancient Tamil literature, poets have stressed the value of education for women. In a famous verse, a poet by the name of Naladiar stated that, \\"What gives beauty to a woman is not the hair style or the patter of her dress or the saffron on her face but only education\\".Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 63. In a verse of Eladhi it states, \\"Beauty does not lie in the style of wailing or in the charm of a blush but only in the combination of numbers and letters (education).\\"Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, pp. 63 & 64. In a 1960 issue of Viduthalai Periyar stated that \\"There should be a drastic revolution in the desires and ideals of Indian women. They should equip themselves to do all types of work that men are doing. They should have good domestic life without allowing nature's obstacles in their own lives. Therefore, there should be a welcome change in the minds of our women. The administrators also most pay special attention to the advancement of women\\".Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 45. Armed forces Periyar advocated for women to be given weapons to protect themselves in reply to a question put in the Central Legislature. He stated that we have no hope that the state governments will do anything in this sphere because most of the state ministers hold the orthodox belief that women are slavish creatures.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 42. Though here and there we find women also as ministers, they are old-fashioned traditionalists who will say, \\"We don't want any kind of freedom. We are perfectly happy with slavery\\". In Periyar's time he explained that \\"\\"Indian\\" women had no self- determination in any sphere of life like education property and marriage. They thought that modern civilization meant dressing themselves like British and American women and adorning themselves. Even our educated women do not entertain any thought that they must enter the police and army departments and learn to pilot airplanes like the women of Russia and Turkey. Just as modern education has made men cowards an book-worms, it has made our women decoratie dolls and weaklings\\". In a leading article written by Periyar in Viduthalai in 1946, he claimed that unless there is a drastic, fundamental and revolutionary change in our administrative machinery, it is impossible to make our women independent beings. Periyar goes on to explain that in our country also, there are thousands of women with the courage, competence and desire to work in the police department. Just as girls going to school was considered wonderful and cycle-riding by girls was considered funny, a few years ago, women on police duty may appear to be wonderful or strange for a few years. Then, in course of time, this will be considered natural. We need methods that will effect an astounding revolution in the world of women. Until we acquire those methods, we will be moving forward like a tortoise and writing and talking about Drowpath and Sita.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 44. Periyar, in a 1932 article of Kudi Arasu, explained that \\"women should develop physical strength like men. They must take exercise and get training in the use of weapons. They must acquire the ability to protect themselves when any sex-mad person tries to molest them. They should get the necessary training to join the armey when need arises and fight the enemy. This is the view of all civilized people. Women also wholeheartedly support this view. When the general view in the world is like this, who can accept the statement of some people that there is no use in giving higher education to women?\\" Birth control * \\"Others advocate birth-control, with a view of preserving the health of women and conserving family property; but we advocate it for the liberation of women.\\"Veeramani, [January 1981](2005) Collected Works of Periyar E.V.R., Third Edition, Chennai. The Periyar Self-Respect Propaganda Institution, p. 570. In the Kudi Arasu of 1932, Periyar explained the basic differences between the reasons given to us for contraception and the reasons given by others for this. We say that contraception is necessary for women to gain freedom. Others advocate contraception taking into consideration many problems like the health of women, the health and energy of the children, the poverty of the country and the maintenance of the family property. Many Westerners also support contraception for the same reasons. Our view is not based on these considerations. We recommend that women should stop delivering children altogether because conception stands in the way of women enjoying personal freedom. Further, begetting a number of children prevents men also from being free and independent. This truth will be clear if we listen to talk of men and women when their freedom is hampered. He went on to say how birth control does not aim at preventing the birth of children altogether, but aims only at limiting births. A man and his wife may have two children, or at the most, three children. This birth control policy is against bringing forth an unlimited number of children.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 47. While Periyar and the Self-Respect movement were advocating for birth control, Rajaji (C. Rajagopalachariar) very strongly opposed it. Others who opposed birth control was Thiru Adhithanar, the publisher of an extremely popular newspaper, Dina Thandhi at the time. In response to Rajaji's stand against birth control, Periyar explained that he was against this since he was of the Vedic Brahmin community that staunchly engrossed in the Manu Dharma. Thus, limiting births of overpopulation would limit diseases and death from many and therefore leave Brahmin priests without a job of doing ceremonies for the sick and funerals. In a 1959 article of Viduthalai he exclaimed that \\"If people like Rajaji discover new islands, make the forests habitable, do propaganda for the birth of more and more children and have farms for the upbringing of children, we may be in a position to understand them.\\"Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 48. During the late 1950s, 80 percent of the men and 90 percent of the women in Tamil Nadu were illiterate. Periyar argued in a 1959 article in Viduthalai that \\"in this situation, if birth control is not practiced and people are allowed to have any number of children, the result will be the multiplication of castes among the \\"Sudras\\", like washermen, barbers, pot-makers, kuravas or gypsies, hunters, fishermen, famers, toddy tappers, padayachies, pillars, cobblers, pariahs, and a thousand others and a limitless increase in population. The increase in population will force the 'Sudras' to preserve themselves from starvation by standing with folded hands before lazy fellows and calling them 'swami', 'master' and 'landlord'. What good result can we expect if birth control is not adopted?\\"Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, pp. 48 & 49. Previously in a 1933 article of the Kudi Arasu, Periyar, in his words, explained that \\"even a High Court Judge in India does not know the amount of trouble that a mother takes to bring up a child. If a husband is kind to his wife and shows concern for her health and happiness, he must adopt the contraceptive method. Otherwise, he must be one who could manage to see that in delivery and in the brining up of children, she does not have much trouble. Therefore, the proper thing to do now is to drastically cut the expenses mentioned above and spend money on the proper upbringing of children with the help of nurses.\\"Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, pp. 19 & 20. Property rights and divorce With regards to property rights for women, Periyar stated that there was no difference between men and women. He went on to say that like men, women should have the right to own property and enjoy its benefits. With regards to divorce or separations, he advocated that a woman can lie away from her husband if he is an undesirable person and if he has nay virulent disease. When a woman has to live apart from her husband in these circumstances, she is entitled to maintenance allowance and a claim on the husband's property. Even if a widow gets remarried, she must be given the right to claim a share of the first husband's property.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 50. On 4 February 1946, the Central Legislature passed an Act giving the right the Hindu married woman to get from her husband in certain circumstances a separate place to live in and a maintenance allowance. Periyar explained how that it was a useless Act. since it seems that the members of the Hindu Mahasabha and Sanadahnis agitated against the grant of even this right.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 57. Dowry On the Dowry system practiced widely throughout the Indian sub-continent not only by Hindus but Christians too, Periyar calls it a \\"serious disease that was spreading fast amongst Tamilians\\". He went on to state that the disease was also found in its virulent form among the Andhras and the Brahmins of Tamil Nadu. Periyar also argued that if a man with property worth one lakh has three daughters, he has to become a beggar by the time these daughters are married. In the name of dowry, the parents of the young men who marry the three daughters, squeeze the man's property out of him.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 65. In the 1959 issue of Viduthalai, Periyar stated that, \\"according to a new legislation, women have the right to a share of the parents' property. Therefore every girl will definitely get her legitimate share from the parents' wealth - if the parents are wealth. It is inhuamane on the part of the parents of a boy to dump on him a girl whom he does not like and to plan to such as much as they can from the property of the girl's father. There is basically no difference between selling education and love for money and selling one's chastity for money. 'Prostitute' is a germ of contempt for a woman; a boy should not be reduced by his avaricous parents to get the name, 'a prostituted boy' or 'a boy that has been sold'. A father-in-law who has means, however miserly he may be by nature, will not be indifferent when his daughter suffers out of poverty. Therefore, it is very shameful on the part of the bridegroom's parents to demand from the bride's father that at the time of the marriage he should gie jewels worth so many thousands along with so many thousand rupees as dowry and that he should provide the bridegroom with a house and a care. The fact that another party makes such demands at the time of his daughter's marriage does not justify any parent's demands at the time of his son's wedding. All people must realize that both demanding and giving dowry are wrong and they must boldly declare this when occasion arises.\\"Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, pp. 66 & 67. Periyar calls the dowry an evil and exploitative practice depriving tens of thousands of talented and beautiful young women with sound character remaining spinsters without any chance of getting married.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 67. Devadasis Among the atrocities the Tamil society committed against women was the practice of keeping some women attached to temples as Devadasis. Dr. Muthulakshmi proposed the resolution at the Madras Legislature that the Devadasi system should be abolished. The Government wanted comments on that from all important people. Periyar in his statement pointed out that the Devadasi system was a disgrace to Hindu religion. The fact that, in the name of a temple or a god, some women are kept as common property is an insult to all the women in the society. He also remarked that the prevalence of this system encouraged immorality among men and thus set the pattern for unprincipled life in many families. This was stoutly opposed in the Assembly by Satyamurthi Iyer, an orthodox Congress member, under the pretext of safeguarding the Hindu traditions. It should be said to the credit of Dr. Muthulakshmi and the leaders like Periyar that the proposal of the Doctor was accepted and a law was enacted against the Devadasi system. Periyar's example of the degradation of women in the Devadasi system is explained that \\"if a man's physical passion is aroused when his wife is not with him, he immediately goes to a prostitute. Rough stones are planted where cows and bufaloes graze to facilitate the animals to rub against the stones when they feel like it.Veeramani, K., Periyar on Women's Rights, p. 35. Likewise, Devadasis served in temples and in all villages rough stones planted on the borders and they say that these two (employing devadasis and the planting rough stones) are aamong the 32 dharmas mentioned in the sastras. When we consider why his kindness to the suffering and also the 32 dharmas are all bogus\\". Resolutions passed As the Self-Respect conference held in Chengalpattu, Tamil Nadu in 1929, the following were among the many resolutions passed with regards for women's rights: #Women should be given equal right along with men for the family property. #There should be no objection to employing women to any job for which they are qualified.Gopalakrishnan, Periyar: Father of the Tamil race, p. 31. #Schools, particularly schools, should try to employ only women teachers. At the conference held in Erode in 1930, the same resolutions were passed again reminding the delegates and others that the interest of women was still uppermost in Periyar's mind. M.R. Jayakar who presided over the Erode conference was greatly impressed by the progressive views of Periyar and other members. He was particularly happy that the movement included not merely non- Brahmin Hindus but Christians and Muslims too. He pointed out that the Self- Respect movement was more progressive than Congress. Furthermore, at the Virudhnagar conference the women members held a separate conference and passed some resolutions demanding that women should have the right to select their life partners without any consideration of religion or community and that weddings should not involve wasteful expenditure and elaborate ceremonies.

Electoral law Tuscany used the national Tatarella Law to elect its Council. Forty councillors are elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists; remaining seats and votes are grouped at regional level where a Hare quota is used, and then distributed to provincial party lists. Ten councillors are elected at-large using a general ticket: parties are grouped in alliances, and the alliance which receives a plurality of votes elects all its candidates, its leader becoming the President of Lombardy. If an alliance wins more than 60% of votes, only five candidates from the regional list will be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 45; if the winning alliance receives less than 50% of votes, special seats are added to the Council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition. Results 1999 European election marked a turning point in relations between Forza Italia and the Lega Nord. In fact, the assembly works in Parliament had highlighted a growing programmatic convergence between the two parties. And so, in view of the 2001 general election, Berlusconi and Umberto Bossi put aside the old, and even bloody quarrels, and formed a new coalition: the House of Freedoms, which found in the regional elections, also in Tuscany, its first test.

Facts Elizabeth Whiteley and her children sued the executors of Benjamin Whiteley's will (of 19 March 1874). The will contained a power to invest the fund on certain investments, including ‚Äúreal securities in England or Wales.‚Äù ¬£5000 of the trust money had been lost. ¬£3000 was invested in a mortgage at 5% return in the freehold of a ten-acre brick field near Pontefract, ‚Äúwith the engine-house, sheds, brick and pipe kilns, and buildings thereon, and all fixtures and fittings thereon.‚Äù ¬£2000 was invested on mortgages at 5% in four small freehold houses, including a shop, in Salford, Lancashire. The brickfield owners went bankrupt in October 1884 and the owner of the four houses filed for petition for liquidation. There was insufficient money to pay the trust fund. Judgments Chancery Court Bacon VC held in the Chancery Court that the brickfield investment was unauthorised, and the trustees were responsible for its failure. The trustees failed to exercise sufficient caution, but they had done so in the case of the houses. The trustees appealed. Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal upheld Bacon VC's decision, that the trustees were liable for repayment of the ¬£3000 invested in the brickfield. They held that a trustee must exercise the standard of care of an ordinary prudent businessman, applying any special knowledge he may have. Cotton LJ stated, Lindley LJ followed. Lopes LJ concurred. House of Lords Lord Halsbury LC affirmed the Court of Appeal. Lord Watson held that in administering and managing trust property (distinguished from the investment sphere), Lord Fitzgerald concurred.

She made her first appearance on 2 April 2008. She was introduced as the adoptive mother to Gennie Walker (Sian Reese- Williams). In 2013, Brenda was diagnosed with a brain tumour, one of the character's biggest storylines. Storylines Backstory Brenda and her husband Bernard adopted Genesis Pascoe (Sian Reese-Williams), known as Gennie, when she was a baby. They were traditional people and had a good relationship with Gennie. Once Bernard died, Gennie began looking for her birth family and began to move away from the strait-laced life she'd lived. By spring 2008, Gennie had tracked down her birth father and was involved in a serious accident upon her arrival in Emmerdale. 2008‚Äî Brenda first appeared when she visited Gennie in hospital. She was friendly with Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) only to recoil when she learned he was responsible for the accident. After Gennie recovered, Brenda went home. When Gennie got to know her biological father Shadrach Dingle (Andy Devine) and his family, Brenda was upset. When she saw Gennie involved in a noisy street protest, she asked Gennie to go home with her. She refused, and Brenda again left. Brenda returned in July 2008 and was concerned by the way Gennie had changed. Eager for Gennie to find employment, Brenda lent her some money - thinking it was for hair dressing materials - but Gennie spent it on a hot tub instead. When Gennie refused to go home with Brenda, she said she would stay until Gennie changed her mind. Soon, Gennie got a job at Eric Pollard's (Chris Chittell) factory, and Brenda got a job at the Post Office/Caf√© in the village, working for Bob Hope (Tony Audenshaw). Bob moved in with Jamie Hope (Alex Carter) and Terry Woods (Billy Hartman) and rent out his flat so Brenda rented it for her and Gennie. Brenda and Bob initially clashed when Brenda tried to remodel the caf√©, but Brenda soon developed feelings for Bob, and took a more active role in his personal life. When Bob realised what was happening, he decided to fix her up with Terry. Brenda was reluctant, but to convince Gennie that she had no feelings for Bob, she kissed Terry during the bonfire night celebrations. Brenda became more interested in Terry but also became insecure, as she'd only ever been with her late husband. Val Pollard (Charlie Hardwick) convinced her to go a diet, which she did - an all-cabbage diet. Her first date with Terry was ruined by her constant trips to the bathroom. Terry thought she thought he was fat, and Bob told him to try self-affirmation exercises. Terry stood in front of his bedroom mirror in nothing but his boxers, telling himself how sexy he was and how Brenda couldn't resist him. Unfortunately, Brenda walked in on him, and thought he was a pervert. Terry followed her to the Woolpack and they quarrelled, he belittled her for only being with her late husband. Brenda was furious. The next day, Bob told Brenda how long Terry had been alone, and Brenda decided to try to patch things up with him. For their next date, Val, Bob, and Betty Eagleton (Paula Tilbrook) convinced Brenda to wear a sexy dress and vamp Terry, but Terry was put off by her aggressiveness. He followed her home to apologise, and they began to kiss. Deciding to take their time, they spent the night in a room at the B&B.; Now that they were officially dating, Brenda became concerned that Terry's young son T.J. didn't like her, as he frequently interrupted them when they were trying to have alone time. Brenda tried bribing him but stopped when Terry opened TJ's lunch box one day and found it packed with sweets. Brenda, Bob and Terry decided to spend Christmas together with their children. Unfortunately soon after, Terry received a letter from TJ's grandmother and his ex, Jean, asking if TJ would like to visit her in Morocco. Brenda convinced Terry to go with TJ for a Christmas break but a few weeks later, Terry emailed, telling her that Jean had been in an accident and he and TJ were staying to look after her. Brenda was suspicious of Jean but tried to stay positive. She began trying to convince Gennie not to go on holiday and asked Gennie to let her tag along. Finally, Brenda booked her own room, and Gennie agreed to go on holiday with her. When Terry returned, Brenda had gone with friend Douglas Potts (Duncan Preston) to the Wylde family's party at Home Farm. Terry crashed the party and explained to Brenda, who was happy to have him back. Douglas and Brenda worked on a project for the children of the village. Known as Emmerdale Explorers and funded primarily by Natasha Wylde (Amanda Donohoe), they came up with various games and crafts. Douglas was annoyed by Terry's suggestions and felt shut out. Emmerdale Explorers was a success, but in March 2009, Natasha's young son Will was upset when she refused to let him go on an Explorers overnight campout. The next morning, Will was missing, and Natasha assumed he'd gone to Explorers and berated Douglas and Brenda. Although she later learned that Will had spent the night in the bushes at Home Farm, Douglas was angry over the way she had treated him, and he returned her donation. Brenda's co-worker, Bob, struggled to make ends meet, due to the credit crunch and Viv's fraud conviction. Although initially reluctant, Brenda persuaded him to sell her half of the business. Douglas, resentful of her relationship with Terry, and made Bob and Terry doubt Brenda's motives for wanting to buy into the business. Brenda was furious that Terry doubted her and Bob called off the deal. When she discovered that Doug was responsible, she poured a pint over his head and told him to mind his own business. Relations between Bob and Brenda further deteriorated after money was stolen from the cash and carry delivery guy. Before the theft, Brenda had chatted to the delivery man and he assumed that Bob and Brenda had planned to steal the money back. He told Bob he'd make sure he didn't get credit from anyone in the area and Bob blamed Brenda. She walked out angrily but returned after Bob apologised. Bob revealed exactly how bad things had become and was about to sell the building when Brenda told him she had the cash to pay off the debts in return for 50% of the business. Brenda had planned to sell her house and pay off the loan but no one was interested in buying her house, causing her to fall into arrears on the loan. Viv, now released from prison, heard her telling Bob and he urged her to tell Terry but she refused so Viv told Terry for her. Terry loaned Brenda his savings to give her some breathing space. While grateful to Terry for his support, she was furious to discover that Viv had told Terry about her financial problems. Angrily, she told Viv to either mind her own business or buy her out. Viv could not afford to buy her out so she agreed to leave Brenda alone. During the cafe fire Viv was trapped inside, and Terry went back inside the burning caf√© when it exploded. Later it was confirmed that Viv and Terry were dead. Brenda later starts a relationship with Bob and is given a granddaughter after Gennie gives birth to her and her fianc√© Nikhil Sharma's (Rik Makarem) baby, Molly. In early 2013, Brenda is diagnosed with a brain tumour after losing centration at the wheel of a car and almost running over rival Val. The doctors advise Brenda to have surgery, but she refuses, much to Gennie's anxiety. Brenda decides not to tell Bob, but confides in his friend Dan Spencer (Liam Fox), leading to Bob thinking that Brenda is having an affair with Dan, and the two men coming to blows outside the caf√©. Brenda reveals that she has a brain tumour, and Bob tells her he will stand by her no matter what. Brenda decides not to have surgery, but after constant nagging from Gennie to have it, Brenda agrees. Nikhil and Gennie bring the date of their wedding forward, which angers Brenda and she tells Gennie that she will not be attending. Brenda also decides not to have surgery to remove the cancer. This leaves Gennie heartbroken, and at the altar just as she is about to marry Nikhil, she has a change of heart, saying she does not want to get married without her mother there. Brenda does eventually attend, but collapses and suffers a seizure whilst there. She is rushed to hospital, but she is told she will be fine. Afterwards, Brenda tells Gennie that she will have surgery. Brenda goes to hospital to have her brain tumour removed, with Gennie, Bob, Nikhil and Dan waiting anxiously. The wait proves too much to Gennie, revealing to Nikhil that she wishes she never pushed Brenda to have surgery. Brenda survives the operation, but she has to wait a few weeks before she is told whether the cancer has fully been removed. In May, Brenda is told by the hospital that the cancer could be reoccurring, which unnerves Brenda. She undergoes chemotherapy in the hope that the tumour will not return, but is devastated when her hair starts falling out. She pleas with Gennie to shave all of her hair off, which leaves both Brenda and Gennie distraught. Brenda is reluctant to show Bob her head, but Bob reassures an worried Brenda that he will always love her, with or without hair, so she reveals her head, and the pair passionately kiss, showing Brenda that Bob really does love her. Brenda prepares for her surprise wedding to Bob but he and Dan appear and takes her on a picnic where a brass band appear and Bob proposes to her which she accepts. Later, Dan contacts a helicopter to take them to the wedding venue that Brenda set up and she proposes to Bob which he accepts then they get married in a hand fasting ceremony by Gennie. Days later, Brenda and Bob are at the Woolpack where the police, along with Debbie and Jai appear. They tell them, Chas and Nikhil that Gennie has died, hitting the quartet hard. They reveal that Gennie was in a car accident at the time, but really Chas' serial killer fianc√© Cameron Murray (Dominic Power) suffocated Gennie after her crash as she overheard him admitting to killing Carl King (Tom Lister) the previous year. Following this, Brenda becomes good friends with Kerry Wyatt (Laura Norton). In 2015, Bob's troublesome daughter Carly Hope (Gemma Atkinson) returns to the village having left her fianc√© and stays with Brenda and Bob. Brenda immediately clashes with Carly, who Brenda is convinced is taking Bob for a ride and trying to break up Bob and Brenda's marriage.

This concept evokes the idea of longer activity, with a higher retirement age and working practices adapted to the age of the employee. It also extends to the social engagement of the elderly in the collectivity. Two men practicing Tahtib, one of them lost his hair, indicating advanced age, on an ostraca from ancient Egypt, Louvre  Demographic changes  Europeans demography shifts towards an elder population with lower birth rates. This will have repercussions on the European economy as less and less active people will support the social costs of health-care and pension of those who stopped working. The EU-Commission has fixed 2 targets for 2010:http://www.euractiv.com/fr/europe-sociale/vieillissement-actif- travailleurs-emettent-reserves/article-164437 Euractiv.com # The Stockholm targets of 2001, which intend to reach 50% higher employment of elder people between 55 and 64. # The Barcelona targets of 2002, which intend to progressively augment of 5 years the age of retirement in order to prolong the professional life of elder people.  Theoretical background  The concept of active ageing was originally inspired by the work of Robert Havighurst on activity theory, according to which elders' well-being relies on them staying active in later life; from this point of view, staying active is key to successfully ageing.Silke van Dyk, Stephan Lessenich, Tina Denninger et Anna Richter (2014). The Many Meanings of ‚ÄúActive Ageing‚Äù. Confronting Public Discourse with Older People‚Äôs Stories, Recherches sociologiques et anthropologiques 44(1): 97-115  Current understandings  At the end of the 20th century organizations such as the OECD and the International Labour Organization used the concept to address the challenges faced by the labour market: lengthening of retirement, maintaining the elderly in employment, etc.Thibauld Moulaert, Sylvie Carbonnelle et Laurent Nisen (2014). Le vieillissement actif dans tous ses √©clats, Presses Universitaires de Louvain. In 2002 the World Health Organization (WHO) gave a new twist to the concept by emphasising the prevention of health problems.WHO (2002).

Sammon, David, et al. \\"Special issue on IS/IT Applications for the Support of Older People.\\" International journal of medical informatics 82.11 (2013): 1035-1036. The concept was then extended to elders being engaged in their communities (e.g. through volunteering) and their family. From this point of view an elder should optimize his or her health in order to benefit his or her own life as much as enrich the collectivity. Critics condemn the normativity of this model as \\"successfully\\" ageing in which elders have to stay active and be involved in activities recognized as beneficial without taking into account their heterogeneous life courses.Stephen Katz (2013).

He is best known as the co-founder of The Big Issue, a magazine that is edited by professional journalists and sold by street vendors who are homeless or vulnerably-housed. Bird sits as an independent Crossbencher member of the House of Lords. Early life Bird was born in a Notting Hill slum to a poor London Irish family. He became homeless at the age of five, resided in an orphanage between the ages of seven and ten, and was often excluded from school. He became a butcher's boy after leaving the orphanage, and supplemented his income by stealing. Between work, he spent several spells in prison during his teens and twenties where he learnt to read, write and the basics of printing. Bird attended Chelsea School of Art, but was homeless again by 1967, sleeping rough in Edinburgh while being sought by the police for petty offences. In the early 1970s, he started to build upon his prison education and set up a small-scale printing and publishing business in London. For two weeks in 1970, he worked as a dishwasher in the Houses of Parliament canteen, an institution he would later return to as a life peer. The Big Issue and work with the homeless In September 1991, Bird launched The Big Issue with Gordon Roddick, co-founder of The Body Shop. In November 1995, he launched The Big Issue Foundation to further support vendors of The Big Issue.The Big Issue History . Bigissue.com (7 September 2011). Retrieved 26 September 2011. He is currently on the Board of Directors for The Big Issue Group, which incorporates The Big Issue, Big Issue Invest (its social investment arm) and The Big Issue Foundation.

Bird is also the founder of the International Network of Street Papers, which now incorporates over 100 street papers, and is published in 34 countries in 24 languages. In 2001, with The Big Issue Group chairman, Nigel Kershaw OBE, Bird founded Big Issue Invest, a provider of finance for businesses, charities and NGOs with the aim of creating positive social change. It is the social investment arm of The Big Issue Group, and initially only dealt in loan finance. In 2009, Big Issue Invest launched a social investment fund, and has since invested more than ¬£30 million in hundreds of social enterprises making a positive impact in communities across the UK.

In May 2007, he unveiled his election manifesto for the 2008 poll, but in October of that year, Bird announced that he had decided not to stand and was instead going to launch a movement \\"to try and do what the CND did over the bomb, but over social injustice\\". In November 2016, Bird suggested that he had been asked to stand as the Conservative Party candidate in 2007 - in place of future Mayor and current Prime Minister, Boris Johnson - but turned the offer down. Bird was a Social Enterprise Ambassador, a scheme was run by Social Enterprise Coalition to promote awareness of social enterprise - a business model used to address a social or environmental needs.

I know this may destroy my reputation among middle-class liberals, but wearing the corsetry of liberalism means that every now and then you have to take it off.\\" He has since stated that he has \\"been hurt by the left, and helped by the left. Just like I've been helped by the right and hurt by the right.\\" Bird was nominated for life peerage by the House of Lords Appointments Commission in October 2015 to become a non-party-political \\"people's peer\\".

Tirelli was born in Gualtieri, a town in the Emilia Romagna region near the River Po. He was the oldest of four siblings and he spent his youth bottling wine with his father who was a wine and grains merchant. Tirelli initially wanted to become a teacher but the idea didn't last long. At the age of sixteen he discovered he had a love of clothing by frequenting the home of Luigi Bigi, a tailor who lived in the same town and who reproduced French fashion in Milan in the 1930s. In 1952, Giorgio Sarassi who, with Bigi's help, had made his fortune in the business of fabrics for high fashion, found Tirelli a job in Milan as a delivery boy and display designer for Marco, a fabric shop in Via Montenapoleone. Across the street was the boutique of Mirsa where Beppe Modenese, the future President of the National Chamber of Italian Fashion, worked at the time. Tirelli and Modenese decided to rent a place together in order \\"to survive because our pay was minimal,\\" as Tirelli recalled in his autobiography, Vestire i sogni. (Dressing Dreams) In 1955, at the age of 27 Tirelli was offered an apprenticeship by Pia Rame and Carlo Mezzadri, who had just purchased the theatre costume manufacturer Finzi. At Finzi Tirelli met Lila de Nobili, who was making the costumes for Maria Callas in Luchino Visconti's La Traviata, due to open at La Scala in Milan in 1955. He also met Piero Tosi, an Academy Awards-nominated costume designer who had worked with Visconti on Il Gattopardo and Death in Venice. Tirelli worked on La Traviata by making the costumes for the female chorus. At the end of the 1950s Tirelli moved to Rome to work in the Sartoria Safas for the sisters Emma and Gita Maggioni. He stayed there until 1964 when he started hiw own business. Over the following fifty years, Tirelli worked with some of the biggest costume designers, including Lila De Nobili, Piero Tosi, Pierluigi Pizzi, Luciano Damiani, Danilo Donati, Gabriella Pescucci, Vera Marzot, Gitt Magrini, Ezio Frigerio, Milena Canonero, Marcel Escoffier, Maurizio Millenotti, Carlo Diappi and Maurizio Monteverde. Tirelli's contribution proved to be essential in terms of philology of fashion, the recovery of age- old techniques, and the quest for authentic outfits. (He had a Collection of 15,000 items, dating from the seventeenth century to the days of Chanel and Dior). An ardent costume collector, Tirelli defined himself as \\"a fashion archeologist\\". He used to say that he did \\"an archeological expeditions\\" every time he bought a costume. Tirelli's costume collection was used for cinema and theater. In 1986, he donated 100 authentic outfits and 100 theatrical costumes to the Galleria del Costume of Palazzo Pitti in Florence. Since his death, his sartoria has been run by Dino Trappetti, Gabriella Pescucci and Giorgio D'Alberti.

It is generally installed in the thalweg, the deepest continuous line along a valley or watercourse, of a cultivated dry valley in order to control erosion. A study carried out on a grassed waterway during 8 years in Bavaria showed that it can lead to several other types of positive impacts, e.g. on biodiversity.Fiener P., Auerswald K. (2003). Concept and effects of a multi- purpose grassed waterway. Soil Use and Management 19, 65-72. Distinctions Confusion between \\"grassed waterway\\" and \\"vegetative filter strips\\" should be avoided. The latter are generally narrower (only a few metres wide) and rather installed along rivers as well as along or within cultivated fields. However, buffer strip can be a synonym, with shrubs and trees added to the plant component, as does a riparian zone.  Runoff and erosion mitigation  Grassed waterway in Velm, Belgium, after a thunderstorm Runoff generated on cropland during storms or long winter rains concentrates in the thalweg where it can lead to rill or gully erosion. Rills and gullies further concentrate runoff and speed up its transfer, which can worsen damage occurring downstream. This can result in a muddy flood. In this context, a grassed waterway allows increasing soil cohesion and roughness. It also prevents the formation of rills and gullies. Furthermore, it can slow down runoff and allow its re-infiltration during long winter rains. In contrast, its infiltration capacity is generally not sufficient to reinfiltrate runoff produced by heavy spring and summer storms. It can therefore be useful to combine it with extra measures, like the installation of earthen dams across the grassed waterway, in order to buffer runoff temporarily.Evrard, O., Vandaele, K., van Wesemael, B., Bielders, C.L, 2008.

Most of them came from the student association Veljesto, which was active at the University of Tartu.

The Manor of Walton was owned by the Ferrers family from the 14th century until they sold it in 1680 to Richard Taylor. In 1723, William Taylor (High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1727) replaced the old manor house with the present structure. Built in red brick, the house presents a three storey balustraded entrance front with seven bays and four full height pilasters. The stable block attached at the rear of the house is in a similar style. In 1773, the estate passed from the last of William Taylor's sisters to her heir, Edward W Disbrowe MP. Disbrowe's grandson, Edward Cromwell Disbrowe, was born at the house in 1790. On the death of writer Charlotte Anne Albinia Disbrowe in 1918, the estate passed to her heir, Lt Col Henry Edward Disbrowe-Wise, who married Katherine Mary Levett-Prinsep, the daughter of Thomas Levett-Prinsep of nearby Croxall Hall.

Professional career Rain or Shine Elasto Painters Mercado was originally drafted by the Alaska Aces as the fifth pick in the 2008 PBA draft. However, he was immediately traded to the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters, together with Eddie Laure for Joe Devance and the 2009 and 2010 second round picks of Alaska. With all the focus on Gabe Norwood, that year's first pick overall, and not much hype he scored a record 29 points in his rookie debut game, the highest since Asi Taulava scored 32 points for Mobiline in his debut. Since then, he slowly became one of the PBA's elite point guards. =PBA Fiesta Conference 2009= If not for a hamstring injury that sidelined him in a couple of games into their semifinal series against the Barangay Ginebra Kings, Rain or Shine would have gone farther in the Fiesta Conference. A member of the All-Rookie Team, Mercado finished second to teammate Gabe Norwood for Rookie of the Year honors. Mercado emerged as the team's top scorer with 13.5 points per game and his 4.5 assists per night did not only lead the team but was also number 6 overall among locals. The only glitch in his rookie season was his 2.9 turnovers per game which ranked seventh overall and led the rookies in that category. =Sophomore Season (Philippine Cup)= He has been the team's cornerstone as he always led the Painters to winning games. Against the Coca-Cola Tigers in a knockout game, he scored 28 points to lead them. But unfortunately they would end up short after losing to the Purefoods Tender Juicy Giants. =PBA Fiesta Conference 2010= He averaged 17.7 points in the eliminations then had a 45-point outburst against the B-Meg Derby Ace Llamados. In another knock out game against the Tigers, he delivered crucial plays, despite fouling out, in a come from behind win. Against the Llamados in Game 3, he almost recorded a triple double with 16 points 15 assists 9 rebounds. But, in Game 5 of the series, they lost to the Llamados. Meralco Bolts Before the start of the 2011 PBA Commissioner's Cup, he and Jay-R Reyes were among the eight players involved in the three-way trade between Meralco, Rain or Shine and Air21 in what was easily one of the biggest trades that happened in that season. Mercado, along with Paolo Bugia were shipped to the Bolts for Beau Belga. He was still able to perform the same way he did with the Elasto Painters. However, it was not enough for the Bolts to past the eliminations of the latter conference. GlobalPort Batang Pier Before the start of the 2013 PBA Commissioner's Cup, he along with Kelly Nabong, Jaypee Belencion and Yousif Aljamal were traded to GlobalPort Batang Pier for Rey Guevarra, Vic Manuel, Josh Vanlandingham and 2015 first round pick. San Miguel Beermen Before the start of the 2014 PBA Commissioner's Cup, Mercado was traded to San Miguel in exchange for Alex Cabagnot. At the start of 2014 PBA Governors' Cup, Mercado changed his jersey number from 0 to 7. Return to GlobalPort Before the 2014‚Äì15 PBA Philippine Cup trade deadline, just before the playoffs, Mercado was traded back to GlobalPort, together with San Miguel's 2018 and 2019 second round picks, in exchange for Cabagnot. Barako Bull Energy On January 8, 2015 Mercado was traded again by GlobalPort, this time to Barako Bull which gave up Denok Miranda and a 2016 second round pick. Barangay Ginebra San Miguel On May 4, 2015 before the start of 2015 PBA Governors' Cup Mercado was traded to Barangay Ginebra in exchange of Joseph Yeo. Mercado promised that he will do anything for Ginebra because he says he is in his best shape of his career. Mercado debuted for Barangay Ginebra on May 8, 2015 against the team that drafted him, the Alaska Aces, but his new team lost. Personal life Mercado is previously engaged to actress Denise Laurel. However, on October 20, 2016, a day after Ginebra won their first title after 8 years, Laurel announced through her Instagram account that they have ended their relationship.

He and his team of three other scientists are most known for having developed the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process in 1942. This process provided a more efficient method for petroleum refiners to obtain high-octane gasoline by through the conversion of crude oil. The team's revolutionary creation is explained in US Patent No. 2,451,804, A Method of and Apparatus for Contacting Solids and Gases, and eventually transformed the way petroleum was developed. Their invention was especially important in World War II, as refiners could finally provide enough fuel for the allies‚Äô fighter planes to battle against the Axis. For his significant contributions to the field of chemical engineering, Campbell was inducted in the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1999. Early life Donald L. Campbell was born in Clinton, Iowa on August 5, 1904. From an early age, he showed a great fascination towards invention and solving problems. He actively indulged himself in building and problem-solving experiments. At the age of 16, Campbell took part in a national essay contest, which was sponsored by the Department of War. Twelve million contestants participated to write on the advantages of joining the army. One of the judges was General John J. Pershing. Out of this pool, Campbell came in first place. The first line of his essay read: ‚ÄúAs Horace Greely once said, ‚ÄòYoung man, go West.‚Äô We now say, ‚ÄòYoung man, join the Army.‚Äô‚Äù He was awarded the prize May 4, 1920 in Washington DC. https://cdn.loc.gov/service/pnp/npcc/01500/01519v.jpg Later, he began his higher-level education at Iowa State University, where he majored in chemical engineering and came first in his class. Afterward, he earned his master‚Äôs degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He completed his education after attending Harvard Business School. Beginning of career His intelligence and interest in chemical engineering eventually led him to work for Exxon. He spent 41 years of his life there, 25 of which he spent in the Exxon Research and Engineering Company (ER&E;). There, he became part of a team of four chemical engineers. Together, the four developed a breakthrough invention called the cracking process. Eventually, as a result of their valuable contributions and efficient teamwork, the four inventors were dubbed the ‚Äúfour horsemen‚Äù by their colleagues. By the end of his career, Campbell owned 30 patents. Major invention In 1942, while working at ER&E;, the ‚Äúfour horsemen‚Äù developed a landmark creation in the field of chemical engineering known as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC). This crucial conversion process enables petroleum refineries to obtain gasoline, aviation fuel, and olefinic gases through the conversion of hydrocarbon fractions at high temperatures. Specifically, the system consists of using high temperatures to break down large molecules of hydrogen carbon into smaller ones. This method was patented as the ‚ÄúMethod of and Apparatus for Contacting solids and Gases Catalytic Cracking‚Äù number 2,451,804. Fortune magazine claimed that this invention is ‚Äúwhat many engineers consider the most revolutionary chemical- engineering achievement of the last 50 years.‚Äù In 1940, using the work of Campbell and his crew, M. W. Kellogg Company operated a pilot plant in the Exxon refinery located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Today, this technique is in wide-use and alone produces of gasoline per day, which is roughly half the world's demand. Significance in WWII During World War II, as the Allies were attempting to overpower the Axis in aerial warfare, the United States suffered a shortage of aviation fuel. At this time, the testing of this new system had been successful for three years. Consequently, FCC was used to increase the national output of aviation fuel by 6,000 percent, providing enough fuel for the war efforts. Many historians argue that the increase in the efficiency of acquiring petroleum contributed to the Allies‚Äô air victory. In addition, this process caused greater production of synthetic rubber for petroleum, therefore making the US independent of Southeast Asia's unstable source of rubber. Later years Aside from his work, Campbell participated in other academic activities. For example, he shared thoughts with a group of academics from several fields, including filmmaking and other fields in science. He focused much of his inventive potential into the bridge games he so loved. He was a husband to Elizabeth Duff Campbell, a father to a son named Michael Duff Campbell and a daughter named Mary Louise Macom, a grandfather to eight grandchildren, and a great-grandfather to nine great-grandchildren. In 1999, he was awarded the Ronald H.

It bears signs of occupation from two periods, the very early Neolithic and the Middle Bronze Age. The site was first excavated between 1986 and 1987 by Yosef Garfinkel of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and between 2002 and 2004 by Susan Cohen of Montana State University. The average of 4 radiocarbon dating results suggested inhabitation of the settlement around 8000 BC. During the Pre- Pottery Neolithic A the site was a small village composed of a few rounded structures. Typical flint finds included a high number of el-Khiam points which Garfinkel argued, along with the relatively early date could class Gesher as a Khiamian site. One outstanding discovery, unknown from any other Neolithic site of the period in the Near East, is a workshop for the production of basalt artifacts. The workshop produced basalt axes and various other tools which were then sent to other early Neolithic centers, such as Jericho and Netiv Hagdud. According to radiometric dates, Gesher is one of the earliest Neolithic sites in the Near East. During this period the first villages were established and the transition to agriculture occurred. A final excavation report on the Neolithic site was published in 2006. During the Middle Bronze Age IIA, Gesher served as a cemetery. Some 20 graves have been uncovered. These are shaft graves, dug into the local sediment, used for individual burials and never reopened. This facilitates the study of burial customs, including body position, the quantity of grave goods and their relation to the deceased. Bronze spearheads and axes (including three duck- bill axes) were found in four of the graves. A final excavation report on the Middle Bronze cemetery was published in 2007.

This is slightly different from traditional methods which synchronize the sender's with the receiver's clock. RBS allows nodes to synchronize their clocks to the resolution necessary for example for wireless sensor network applications. Rather than broadcasting a timestamp in a synchronization packet as in protocols such as Network Time Protocol, RBS allows the nodes receiving the synchronization packets to use the packet's time of arrival as a reference point for clock synchronization. Because most of the non-deterministic propagation time involved in transmitting a packet over a wireless channel lies between the construction of the packet and the sender's transmitter (e.g., sender's queue delay, MAC contention delay, etc.), by timestamping only at the receiver, RBS removes most delay uncertainty involved in typical time synchronization protocols. For single-hop networks, the RBS algorithm is very simple. First, a transmitter broadcasts some number M as reference broadcasts. Each receiver that receives these broadcasts exchanges the time that each reference broadcast was received locally with its neighbors. Nodes then calculate phase shifts relative to each other as the average of the difference of the timestamps of the node's local clocks for the M reference broadcasts. In multihop networks, time synchronization can be performed hop by hop between two nodes as long as the nodes on each link along the path have a common node whose reference broadcasts they can synchronize to.J.

Seasons Winter The cold weather commences early in November and comes to an end in the middle of March. The climate in the October and November is pleasant. The days are bright and warm and the sun is not too hot. As soon as the sun sets the temperature falls and the heat of the day yields place to a sharp bracing cold. The cold waves locally known Sheet-lahar brings in the sharpness in winter and drastically drops the temperature in Bihar disrupting lives of millions of poor people and also causes several deaths. The temperature in Winter all over Bihar varies from 0‚Äì10 ¬∞C. On 7 January 2013, in early morning, mercury dipped to a record low to -2 ¬∞C in Forbesganj, 0 ¬∞C in Gopalganj, 0.2 ¬∞C in Jehanabad, 0.7 ¬∞C in Vaishali, -1 ¬∞C in Patna, Muzaffarpur and other cities. December and January are the coldest months in Bihar. Summer The hot weather sets in March and lasts until the middle of June. The highest temperature is often registered in May which is the hottest month in the state. Like the rest of the northern India, Bihar also experiences dust-storms, thunder-storms and dust-raising winds during the hot season. Dust storms having a velocity of 48‚Äì64 km/hour are most frequent in May and with second maximum in April and June. The hot winds (loo) of Bihar plains blow during April and May with an average velocity of 8‚Äì16 km/hour. This hot winds greatly affects human comfort during this season. Monsoon variation in rainfall across India. The monsoon season in Bihar is usually becoming very unpredictable and erratic. In last one decade Bihar recorded 6 to 7 drought years. The last time Bihar truly had a wet year was in 2007. From 2009 till 2019 Bihar experienced erratic monsoons with least rainy days. The concern is growing because due to rapid industrialisation and cutting of trees led to serious climate change in the state. Begusarai district of Bihar is one of the most affected area due to climate change. Begusarai used to receive around 1200 to 1300 mm of annual rainfall annually with 1750 mm in 2007 but now it receives less than 500 to 600 mm due to which there's less rice cultivation and other crops which require high rainfall. This area of Bihar was known to grow varieties of rice but farmers are not willing to grow rice due to shortage of rain and irrigation. There's a concern about climate change that is serious and fatal because now people are experiencing shortage of groundwater. Soon after Mid June this the rainy season commences and continues till the end of September, the beginning of this season occurs when a storm from the Bay of Bengal passes over Bihar. The commencement of monsoon may be as early as the last week of May or as the first or second week of July. The rainy season begins in June. The rainiest months are July and August. The rains are the gifts of the south west monsoon. There are three distinct areas where rainfall exceeds 1800 mm. Two of them lie on northern and north-western wings of the state and the third lies in the Netarhat pat. The south-west monsoon normally withdraws from Bihar in the first week of October. Post Monsoon An important feature of the retreating monsoon season in Bihar is the invasion of tropical cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal at about 12¬∞ N latitude. Bihar is also influenced by the typhoons originating in the south China sea. The maximum frequency of the tropical cyclones in Bihar is during September‚ÄìNovember especially during the asterism called hathiya. These cyclones are essential for the maturing of paddy, and are required for the moistening of the soil for the cultivation of rabi crops.

It is an entirely land‚Äìlocked state, in a subtropical region of the temperate zone. Bihar lies between the humid West Bengal in the east and the sub humid Uttar Pradesh in the west, which provides it with a transitional position in respect of climate, economy and culture. It is bounded by Nepal in the north and by Jharkhand in the south. Bihar plain is divided into two unequal halves (North Bihar and South Bihar) by the river Ganges which flows through the middle from west to east. Bihar's land has average elevation above sea level of 173 feet. Political geography The state is divided into 9 divisions and 38 districts, for administrative purposes. which are listed below. Geology Bihar is in Indo-Gangetic plain so naturally fertile soil is one asset of the state. Thus Indo-Gangetic plain's soil is the backbone of agricultural and industrial development. The Indo-Gangetic plain in Bihar consists of a thick alluvial mantle of drift origin overlying in most part, the siwalik and older tertiary rocks. The soil is mainly little young loam rejuvenated every year by constant deposition of silt, clay and sand brought by streams but mainly by floods in Bihar This soil is deficient in phosphoric acid, nitrogen and humus, but potash and lime are usually present in sufficient quantity. The most common soil in Bihar is Gangetic alluvium of Indo-Gangetic plain region, Piedmont Swamp Soil which is found in northwestern part of West Champaran district and Terai Soil which is found in eastern part of Bihar along the border of Nepal.Soil of Bihar clay soil, sand soil and loamy soil are common in Bihar.other common soil in Bihar Natural resources Bihar is mainly a vast stretch of very fertile flat land. It is drained by the Ganges River, including northern tributaries of other river. The Bihar plain is divided into two unequal halves by the river Ganges which flows through the middle from west to east. Other Ganges tributaries are the Son, Budhi Gandak, Chandan, Orhani and Phalgu. The Himalayas begin at foothills a short distance inside Nepal but influence Bihar's landforms, climate, hydrology and culture. Central parts of Bihar have some small hills, for example the Rajgir hills. The Himalayan Mountains are to the north of Bihar, in Nepal. To the south is the Chota Nagpur plateau, which was part of Bihar until 2000 but now is part of a separate state called Jharkhand. 1.Forest Bihar has notified forest area of 6,764.14 km¬≤, which is 7.1 per cent of its geographical area. The sub Himalayan foothill of Someshwar and Dun ranges in Champaran district another belt of moist deciduous forests. These also consists of shrub, grass and reeds. Here the rainfall is above 1,600 mm and thus promotes luxuriant Sal forests in the favoured areas. The hot and dry summer gives the deciduous forests. The most important trees are Shorea Robusta (Sal), Shisham, Cedrela Toona, Khair, and Semal. This type of forests also occurs in Saharsa district and Purnia district. 2.Minerals Bihar is a producer of Steatite (945 tonnes), Pyrites (9,539 tonnes/year), Quartzite (14,865 tonnes/year), Crude Mica (53 tonnes/year), Limestone (4,78,000 tonnes/year).

Its first editor was Thomas Jones and the publication was funded by David Davies, 1st Baron Davies. The magazine was intended by Jones to provide a platform to discuss critically the changes in Welsh society of the time, while aiming for social progress. Its contributors and editorial team were drawn largely from Cardiff and South Wales. Although influential among the governing elite in Wales, it achieved sales of only 2,000, dropping markedly in the 1930s.G.

Larkin, QC was the Attorney General for Northern Ireland He was the first person to hold the office separately since its functions were assumed by the Attorney General for England and Wales in 1972. He was the first holder of the office not to be a politician sitting in either the Parliament of Northern Ireland, at Stormont, or the UK Parliament. Early life Larkin was born in Belfast and educated at St Mary's Christian Brothers' Grammar School and Queen's University Belfast, where he read law. He was subsequently called to the Bar of Northern Ireland and practised as a barrister. Career In the early 1980s he was involved in politics as a member of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, but ceased to be active as his legal career took off. In 1989, at the age of 25, Larkin was appointed as Reid Professor of Criminal Law, Criminology and Penal Law at Trinity College, Dublin. He returned to Northern Ireland in the 1990s to work at the Northern Ireland Bar, specialising in administrative law, civil liberties and human rights, competition and constitutional law, defamation and judicial review. On 20 November 2013 he recommended eliminating prosecutions, inquests or inquiries into events which preceded the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Certain politicians and policemen accused him of attempting to violate international law. On 25 November he received a letter from Jim Allister regarding Traditional Unionist Voice allegations against the BBC to which he replied three days later saying that it would not be appropriate for him to comment on that issue. On 10 June 2014 he attended hearing on the so-called on-the-run letters.  Resignation John Larkin stood down on 30th Jun 2020 as Attorney General and was Replaced by Brenda King the former First Legislative Counsel in the Executive Office.

It was held that Transco had \\"shown a complete and utter disregard for the public,\\" The court ruled that it was possible to prosecute for culpable homicide; However, it is possible to convict of culpable homicide only if the court could identify an individual or group of individuals being a directing mind in the company; therefore, the charges of culpable homicide were irrelevant and subsequently dismissed.

Projects Plaxton Pointer 1 bodied Dennis Dart SLF in Sheffield in May 2012 The Mobility Management project promotes closer operational co-operation and aims to provide a more coherent offer to passengers across South Yorkshire, e.g. by standardising fares for the different services. All new vehicles and some of the existing ones have the same ‚ÄòDoor-to-door‚Äô livery as part of the Travel South Yorkshire brand. SCT works with SYPTE to develop a package of transport related measures designed to assist the economic regeneration of the sub-region. One example of this is the South Yorkshire Wheels to Work project. Funding partners include Yorkshire Forward and Coalfields Regeneration Trust for employment opportunities where public transport doesn't exist at the right times or locations. SCT is an approved centre for the new EU Driver Certificate of Professional Competence. The qualification is a requirement for all new and existing PCV drivers. SCT also provides minibus training in the form of MiDAS (Minibus Drivers Awareness Scheme). This is a national scheme that has been in operation for over 10 years.

The magazine contained fiction, poetry, reviews and articles pertaining to Wales. The journal started as a quarterly publication (No. 1 (Summer 1937)-No. 11 (Winter 1939-1940), became a Wartime Broadsheeet (No. 1 (1941)), then moved to six-monthly publication (1943-1949). In 1958 it was restarted as a monthly publication with No. 32, ending with No. 47 in January 1960. It was edited throughout its existence by Keidrych Rhys, and published on his behalf by The Druid Press, Carmarthen, and printed by Western Mail & Echo Ltd, and latterly by the Tudor Press, London. The magazine was an important influence on Welsh literature.[BBC News  WALES  Hannan's Call to Order] Robert Graves, who became a close correspondent with Rhys and Lynette Roberts, held high hopes for this magazine, which he felt could be a \\"record- vehicle\\" for a new movement of tradition-minded, modern Celtic poets. In the Wales magazine, Rhys published articles, short stories, and poems by an array of predominantly Welsh writers and thinkers, such as Alun Lewis, Saunders Lewis, Dylan Thomas, Glyn Jones and Lynette Roberts. Early drafts of parts of Robert Graves's book on mythology and poetry, The White Goddess, were published there as three articles ('Dog', 'Roebuck' and 'Lapwing') between 1944 and 1945. The magazine was a conscious attempt to provide a platform for 'younger progressive Welsh writers' who felt that their contribution to British culture was marginalised, and represented the creation of \\"Anglo-Welsh literature\\" (Welsh writing in English) as a concept.Oxford Companion the Literature of Wales (1986), p. 622 The magazine is being digitised by the Welsh Journals Online project at the National Library of Wales.

They are multicellular and superficially resemble land plants because of stem-like and leaf-like structures. They are found in fresh water, particularly in limestone areas throughout the northern temperate zone, where they grow submerged, attached to the muddy bottom. They prefer less oxygenated and hard water and are not found in waters where mosquito larvae are present. They are covered with calcium carbonate deposits and are commonly known as stoneworts. Cyanobacteria have been found growing as epiphytes on the surfaces of Chara, where they may be involved in fixing nitrogen, which is important to plant nutrition. Light micrograph of unidentified cyanobacteria and other biofilm organisms growing as epiphytes on the surface of Chara species in a rice paddy in Louisiana, USA.  Structure  The branching system of Chara species is complex with branches derived from apical cells which cut off segments at the base to form nodal and internodal cells alternately.Round, F.E. 1965.The Biology of the algae. Ernest Arnold. The main axes bear whorls of branches in a superficial resemblance to Equisetum (a vascular plant).Bryant, J. 2007. The Stoneworts (Chlorophyta. Charales) in Guiry, M.D., John, D.M., Rindi, F. and McCarthy, T.K. 2007. New Survey of Clare Island. Volume 6: The Freshwater and Terrestrial Algae. Royal Irish Academy They are typically anchored to the littoral substrate by means of branching underground rhizoids. Chara plants are rough to the touch because of deposited calcium salts on the cell wall. The metabolic processes associated with this deposition often give Chara plants a distinctive and unpleasant smell of hydrogen sulfide. Morphology The plant body is a gametophyte. It consists of a main axis (differentiated into nodes and internodes), dimorphic branches (long branch of unlimited growth and short branches of limited growth), rhizoids (multicellular with oblique septa) and stipulodes (needle shaped structures at the base of secondary laterals).  Reproduction  Light micrograph of a whole-mount slide of an alt=Light micrograph of a whole-mount slide of an oogonium and antheridium of Chara Chara reproduces vegetatively and sexually. Vegetative reproduction takes place by tubers, amylum stars and secondary protonemata. The sex organs are a multicellular and jacketed globule or antheridium (male) and nucule or archegonium (female). The antheridia and archegonia may occur on separate plants (dioicy), together on the same plant (conjoined monoicy) or separately on the same plant (sejoined monoicy). After fertilization, the zygote develops into an oospore.  Species  Distribution Chara has a cosmopolitan distribution, from 69 degrees north in northern Norway to about 49 degrees south in Kerguelen Islands (Pal et al., 1962). About 27 species are found in India.Soni, N.K. Fundamentals of Botany Vol. 1, Tata McGraw-Hill Education, p72, There are about 40 species of Chara in Europe, where they are commonly found in the specific habitat-type designated as H3140 (hard oligo- mesotrophic waters with benthic vegetation of Chara spp h1) in the Natura 2000 plans of the European Union. Although this habitat is found all across Europe, it is threatened and to be protected and preserved. The Netherlands are home to 20 species of Chara, growing in lakes and ponds of the habitat-type H3140. The H3140 habitats in the Netherlands, are considered important in the overall preservation efforts and therefore also for the Chara species in general.H3140 - Hard oligo-mesotrophic waters with benthic vegetation of Chara spp h1. Denmark. Here, many former Chara habitats (H3140) have been polluted by either toxins or excessive amounts of nutrients (in particular phosphates and nitrogen), but a few large lakes and ponds remain.

Jonathon Green is often referred to as the English-speaking world's leading lexicographer of slang,See, for example, the author biography on Green's article Antisemitic insults: a lexicon published in Engage, and the introduction to another audio interview, \\"Jonathon Green ‚Äì 5th July 2007\\", published in The Generalist. and has even been described as \\"the most acclaimed British lexicographer since Johnson\\". Life and career Of Jewish origin,Nick Groom \\"'I could say it 1,000 ways and they'd probably all offend'\\", Times Higher Education Supplement, 9 June 2000 Green was educated at Bedford School (1961‚Äì1965) and Brasenose College, Oxford (1966‚Äì1969) where he read history. An author, freelance journalist, broadcaster and lecturer, Green's primary activity is the collection and analysis of slang. To this end, he has amassed a database, which ‚Äì according to Green ‚Äì holds around 135,000 slang words and phrases, underpinned by c. 650,000 citations (examples of usage). It covers English-language slang since the 16th century and offers the vocabularies of the UK, US, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the anglophone Caribbean. This database provides a resource for all his slang-related publications. For Green, slang is as much a part of the greater English language as any other of its sub-sets such as dialect or technicalities. But unlike those, it opts for an actively oppositional role. With a conscious acknowledgement of the counterculture of the 1960s (in which he played a part and of which he has written) he has termed slang the 'counter-language' and more recently 'the language that says \\"no\\"'.Introduction. Born at the margins it has remained there, even if the secrecy that lay at the heart of older slang cannot resist the information flow of the modern world. The sixties counterculture was the subject of his first oral history, Days in the Life: Voices from the English Underground 1961‚Äì1971 (1988), for which he \\"interviewed more than 100 of 'the main players', got 500,000 words on tape, [and] a 400,000-word manuscript\\"; the book emerged around half this length. The study All Dressed Up: The Sixties and the Counterculture (1998) was the source of litigation, from both former Beatle George Harrison and artist Caroline Coon, and was withdrawn for 12 months. In June 2000, Coon received damages of ¬£40,000, plus ¬£33,000 costs, from publisher Random House, for the false claims Green had made.Michael Smith \\"Sex-for-charity slur costs ¬£40,000\\", Daily Telegraph, 13 June 2000 Authority on slang The single- volume Chambers Slang Dictionary (Chambers Harrap) was first published in 1998; a second edition appeared in October 2008. Green's most substantial work in this field is Green's Dictionary of Slang: a three volume slang work which traces, via examples and citations drawn from the last five centuries, the history of the slang vocabulary from the earliest use of every term. It includes slang from across the English-speaking world. It was published in the UK in late November 2010 and in the US in March 2011. An e-book version has been released as part of the Oxford Digital Reference Shelf collection. Green's Dictionary of Slang was awarded the 2012 Dartmouth Medal ‚Äì an annual award from the Reference and User Services Association (RUSA) recognizing the most outstanding reference work of the year.

He started to play the piano at age of six. From 1968 he lived in Saint-Jean-de-Luz where he studied with Ada Labeque until he entered the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique de Paris: he completed his musical studies at the age of 17 winning a 1st Piano Prize (class of Yvonne Loriod) and a 1st Prize in Chamber Music (class of Genevi√®ve Joy). Subsequently, he attended the master- classes of eminent musicians such as Vlado Perlemuter, Nikita Magaloff, Rafael Da Silva, Charles Rosen, Gy√∂rgy Seb√∂k, Paul Badura-Skoda and Claude Helffer. Awarded a Fulbright Scholarship in 1979, he decided to perfect his skills in New York City studying at the Juilliard School with Jacob Lateiner and William Masselos: in the meanwhile, he obtained the 1st Prize at the Gina Bachauer Memorial Piano Competition at Juilliard. He also won several other International Piano Competitions (Maria Canals International Music Competition 2nd Prize in Barcelona, Marsala's 2nd Prize, Vercelli's 4th Prize, Epinal's 4th Prize...). A dazzling career starts with new international awards: Grand Prize of the Charles Cros Academy with the violinist Raphael Oleg for their recording of Schumann's Sonatas (1980), 3rd Prize and Special Prize of Contemporary Music at the Paloma O'Shea Santander International Piano Competition in Spain (1982), 1st Prize at the Ciudade do Porto International Piano Competition (1984). These successes led him to give recitals around the world: France, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, United States, Japan, Australia and South Africa. He performed regularly with various orchestras (Radio France New Philharmonic Orchestra, Spanish Radio Television Orchestra, Orchestre national du Capitole de Toulouse...). He was invited as a soloist by various foreign televisions and radios, and has also recorded for Radio France and French Television. The eclecticism of his tastes led him to become interested in a diverse and sometimes unexplored repertoire (Ricardo Vi√±es, Ernesto Nazareth, Guillaume Lekeu...) and his interest for the contemporary music made him participate in many first performances mainly with the Montpellier Philharmonic Orchestra and with several French contemporary musical ensembles such as 2E2M, GERM, Musique Oblique, and Contrechamps.

Early life Born in Broome, Western Australia, Walters was diagnosed with leukaemia at the age of 6, but overcame the cancer after spending a year in a Perth hospital in 2003. Career Australia director Baz Luhrmann had been searching for a young aboriginal boy to fill the role of \\"Nullah\\" for over 12 months when one of the film's casting directors saw Walters with his father at a Broome swimming pool in 2007; he also responded to an Australia-wide radio callout for auditions. He later received a letter from Luhrmann saying that he was \\"very, very interested\\" in him. Walters, who had never before left Western Australia, and a group of other boys who had auditioned for the role were flown to Sydney to attend acting workshops at Fox Studios Australia. He and his family went camping with Luhrmann at Broome's Eighty Mile Beach, which was when Walters decided to take the role and become involved in the film. When Walters joined the cast, he had never heard of the film's stars Nicole Kidman or Hugh Jackman. Walters had only ever seen a few films, but was nevertheless quoted by Luhrmann as having \\"natural cinematic chemistry\\". Though Kidman and Walters were shy upon their first meeting with each other, she said that they bonded on the set of the film and \\"I feel very protective of him... [and] if the film does really well he's going to need a lot of protection\\"; reportedly, Kidman and Luhrmann set up a trust fund for Walters to secure his future. Luhrmann, who also cast Walters in a Tourism Australia advertising campaign, claimed, \\"Our next leading man is about four-foot high, [with] long, sort of gold hair, and is an Aboriginal boy.\\" For his performance as Nullah, Walters won a Satellite Award for New Talent and received nominations for Best Young Actor at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards and Most Promising Performer at the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards. He also starred in the first (2012) season of the ABC3 series Bushwhacked!, but was replaced in the second (2014) season by Kamil Ellis.

This viewpoint describes feminism as the perpetuation of oppressive medieval conventions such as devotional chivalry and romanticized relationships, rather than as a movement towards liberation.Christa Hodapp, Men's Rights, Gender, and Social Media, Lexington Books (September 5, 2017) A study by Peter Wright concluded that gynocentrism is a form of female narcissism associated with traditional gender roles.Wright, P. 'Gynocentrism As A Narcissistic Pathology,' in New Male Studies: An International Journal, ISSN 1839-7816 ~ Vol 9, Issue 1, 2020, Pp. 24‚Äì49, 2020 Australian Institute Of Male Health And Studies. Religious studies professors Paul Nathanson and Katherine K. Young claim that feminist calls for equality or equity are a subterfuge for gynocentrism.Nathanson, Paul; Young, Katherine K. (2006), \\"Women's rights v. human rights: the case of entitlements\\", in Etymology The term gynocentrism is derived from ancient Greek, Œ≥œÖŒΩŒÆ and Œ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒøŒΩ. ŒìœÖŒΩŒÆ can be translated as woman or female, but also as wife. In ancient Greek compounds with Œ≥œÖŒΩŒÆ, the stem Œ≥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒπŒ∫- is normally used. This stem can be spotted in the genitive case Œ≥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒπŒ∫œåœÇ, and in the older form of the nominative case Œ≥œçŒΩŒ±ŒπŒæ. In ancient Greek, no compounds are known to exist with Œ≥œÖŒΩŒÆ that start with Œ≥œÖŒΩŒø- or Œ≥œÖŒΩœâ-. The ancient Greek word Œ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒøŒΩ can be translated as sharp point, sting (of bees and wasps), point of a spear and stationary point of a pair of compasses, with the meaning centre of a circle related to the latter. The meaning centre/middle point (of a circle) is preserved in the Latin word centrum, a loanword from ancient Greek. The English word centre is derived from the Latin centrum. The word Œ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒøŒΩ is derived from the verb Œ∫ŒµŒΩœÑŒµ·øñŒΩ, meaning to sting (of bees), to prick, to goad, and to spur. When trying to explain etymologically the term gynocentrism, it is important to consider the ancient Greek Œ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒøŒΩ, with the signification middle point/centre, and not the more obvious ancient Greek word Œ∫ŒµŒΩœÑœÅŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ (mirroring -centrism). Criticism Nathanson and Young state that ideologically, the overriding focus of gynocentrism is to prioritize females hierarchically, and as a result may be interpreted as misandry (hatred of and prejudice towards men). Feminist calls for equality or even equity are often, according to them, a subterfuge for gynocentrism. They define gynocentrism as a worldview based on the implicit or explicit belief that the world revolves around women, a cultural theme that they claim has become 'de rigueur' behind the scenes in law courts and government bureaucracies, resulting in systemic discrimination against men.Nathanson, Paul; Young, Katherine K. (2006), \\"Misandry v. equality\\", in They further state that gynocentrism is a form of essentialism ‚Äì as distinct from scholarship or political activity on behalf of women- to the extent that it focuses on the innate virtues of women and the innate vices of men.Nathanson, Paul; Young, Katherine K. (2006), \\"Misandry v. equality\\", in Some authors make discriminations between individual gynocentric acts and events, such as Mother's Day, and the more general concept of a gynocentric culture which refers to a larger collection of culture traits that have major significance in the way people's lives were lived.Wright, Peter (2014), \\"Introduction to gynocentrism\\", in Some post- modern feminists such as Nancy Fraser question the assumption of a stable concept of 'woman' which underlies all gynocentrism.La Caze, Marguerite (2006), \\"Splitting the difference: between Young and Fraser on identity politics\\", in Nathanson and Young make a comparable claim that gynocentrism is a form of essentialism as distinct from scholarship or political activity on behalf of women, to the extent that it focuses on the innate virtues of women. Nathanson and Young add that \\"This worldview is explicitly misandric too, because it not only ignores the needs and problems of men, but also attacks men.\\" Christina Hoff Sommers has argued that gynocentrism is anti- intellectual and holds an antagonistic view of traditional scientific and creative disciplines, dismissing many important discoveries and artistic works as masculine. Sommers also writes that the presumption of objectivity ascribed to many gynocentrist theories has stifled feminist discourse and interpretation.Hoff Sommers, Christina (1995), \\"Transforming the academy\\", in Feminist writer Lynda Burns emphasises that gynocentrism calls for a celebration of women's positive differences‚Äîof women's history, myths, arts and music‚Äîas opposed to an assimilationist model privileging similarity to men.La Caze, Marguerite (2006), \\"Splitting the difference: between Young and Fraser on identity politics\\", in However observed in practice, the preeminence of women associated with gynocentric narratives is often seen as absolute: interpersonally, culturally, historically, politically, or in broader social contexts such as popular entertainment. As such, it can shade into what Rosalind Coward called \\"womanism...a sort of popularized version of feminism which acclaims everything women do and disparages men\\".Coward, Rosalind (2000), \\"Introduction\\", in The Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW) community describes themselves as a backlash against the misandry of gynocentrism. Articles about MGTOW: * * * In contemporary society In a 2019 study of Trinidad society published in the Justice Policy Journal, researchers concluded that \\"gynocentrism pervades all aspects of the criminal justice system as well as society.\\"Wallace, W.

The account survives in five manuscripts from the period 1220-1375, including Codex Scardensis, and in five copies of these earlier manuscripts from the period 1600-1800; a summary survives in a manuscript from the 15th century. Of these manuscripts and copies, most are fragmentary or otherwise defective.Bell (1983:265). \\"Queen Hel\\" In Bartholomeus saga postola, Barthalomew is in his assigned apostolic territory of \\"India\\". The inhabitants there make sacrifices to an idol, and within the idol a devil hides who spiritually entraps men while appearing as if to cure their physical ills. Upon Bartholomew's arrival, he renders the devil impotent, demonstrating his own curative powers by curing the madness of the king's daughter. Bartholomew miraculously appears to the king while he is in his bedchamber, preaches to the king, and offers to expose the devils within the idols the following morning.Bell (1983:263‚Äì264). The next morning, when the pagans start making sacrifices, the devil within the idol says: > \\"Stop sacrificing to me, you wretches, lest you have it worse; I am bound > with fiery bonds by the angels of Jesus Christ, whom the Jews crucified, > thinking him to be a man and susceptible to death; but he made war on Hel > our queen and bound the very chieftain of Hell [or Hel, heliar hofƒëingia] > with fiery bonds, and he arose from death on the third day, and gave the > sign of his cross to his apostles and sent them into all corners of the > earth; and now one of them has come here, and that is who has bound me.\\"Bell > (1983:264). Queen Hel is not mentioned again in the work. Michael Bell says that while Hel \\"might at first appear to be identical with the well-known pagan goddess of the Norse underworld\\" as described in chapter 34 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, \\"in the combined light of the Old English and Old Norse versions of Nicodemus she casts quite a different a shadow\\", and that in Bartholomeus saga postola \\"she is clearly the queen of the Christian, not pagan, underworld\\".Bell (1983:264‚Äì265).

The manuscript has been assigned to the 3rd century, palaeographically, though an earlier date cannot be excluded. It contains some unusual orthographic features, which have been found nowhere else. It is possibly the only surviving manuscript of the Greek Diatessaron, unless Papyrus 25 is also a witness to that work. The text of the fragment was reconstructed by Kraeling and Welles. Dura Parchment 24 is currently housed at Yale University (P. Dura 24), New Haven catalogued there as Dura Parch. 10.  History of the manuscript  Dura-Europos church in Dura Europolis On March 5, 1933, during the excavations conducted by Clark Hopkins amongst the ruins of a Roman border-town, Dura-Europos, on the lower Euphrates, under the embankment which filled in the street inside the wall and also covered the Christian church and the Jewish synagogue, the parchment fragment now known as Dura Parchment 24 was found. Susan Hopkins was the first to recognize it as a portion of the Gospel.D. Plooij, A Fragment of Tatian's Diatessaron in Greek, The Expository Times, Vol. 46, No. 10, p. 471 (1935) \\"...in one of the baskets of finds from the embankment, behind (west of) Block L8 and not far from Tower 18\\". The fragment was examined by Carl H. Kraeling, who published its text in 1935, with an extensive discussion. Kraeling concluded that the fragment was a copy of Tatian's Diatessaron.Kraeling, Carl H., A Greek Fragment of Tatians's Diatessaron from Dura. Studies and Documents 3 (London, 1935) It was re-edited, with a minor corrections, by C. Bradford Welles in 1959.C. Badford Welles, and others, The Parchments and Papyri, volume 5, (New Haven, 1959), pp. 23-24 According to Plooij \\"There is no reasonable doubt that the fragment is really Tatian\\".Plooij, D., A Fragment of Tatian's Diatessaron in Greek, The Expository Times, Vol. 46, No. 10, p. 472 (1935) According to Parker, Taylor, and Goodacre it is another harmony of the four Gospels, different to Diatessaron, and much closer to the text of the Gospels.D. C. Parker, D. G. K Taylor and M. S. Goodacre, The Dura-Europos Gospel Harmony, in: D. G. K. Taylor, Studies in the Early Text of the Gospels and Acts, SBL Text-Critical Studies 1 (Atlanta, GA 1999), pp. 192-228. Jan Joosten criticised the methods employed by Taylor, Goodacre, and Parker, according to him, these methods would have eliminated many other Tatianic witnesses because of diversity and variability in these witnesses. Dura Parchment does not constitute evidence of non-Diatessaronic composition.Tatian's Diatessaron The manuscript was added to the list of the New Testament manuscripts by Kurt Aland in 1953.  Description  It is not, strictly speaking, a manuscript of the New Testament ‚Äî it contains only phrases from the text of the Gospels. On a single parchment leaf (10.5 cm by 9.5 cm), the following texts were copied: Matthew 27:56‚Äì57; Mark 15:40,42; Luke 23:49,50,51; John 19:38. Generally, it has been regarded as a fragment of Tatian's Diatessaron (Gospel harmony). Only one side of the leaf has been used, and may well have come from a scroll.D. C. Parker, D. G. K. Taylor, M. S. Goodacre, \\"The Dura-Europos Gospel Harmony,\\" in Studies in the Early Text of the Gospels and Acts, ed. D. G .K. Taylor, Birmingham: University of Birmingham Press, 1999, p. 192 ff. The text was written one column per page, 15 (or more) lines per page, 30‚Äì35 letters per line, in uncial letters. Parts of the leaf have decayed, resulting in some loss from the text ‚Äî approximately the first five to seven letters of each line. Additionally, some other letters are not legible. Classic nomina sacra abbreviations were employed by the scribe, with the typical linear superscript.See: The text is written in a good book-hand. There are three kinds of alpha: the older capital, the uncial, and the 3rd-century-cursive‚Äìtype. The letters tau and eta (in the word œÑŒ∑œÇ ‚Äî 'the') have unusual characters, and were written with ligatures. The letter mu is characterized by a deep saddle.Bruce M. Metzger, Manuscripts of the Greek Bible: An Introduction to Palaeography, Oxford University Press, Oxford 1981, p. 66. The text of the manuscript has some unusual orthographic features, which have been found nowhere else. For example, the letter upsilon (Œ•) appears at several points in the text, but not connected with it in any way that has yet been understood. (See text transcription below, with lower case upsilon ‚Äî œÖ.)  Text   Textual character of 0212  In Luke 23:49 it contains a unique reading: \\"the wives of those who had been his disciples\\". In Matthew 27:57, the city Arimathea, normally spelled ŒëœÅŒπŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ±ŒπŒ±, is spelled ŒïœÅŒπŒΩŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ±ŒπŒ± (Erinmathea).Bruce M. Metzger, The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission and Limitations, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977, p. 32. The text twice agrees with Codex Vaticanus and Bohairic against everything else (in line 1. added Œ±Œπ before Œ≥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒπŒ∫Œ∑œÇ; in line 9. Œ∫Œ±Œπ between Œ±Œ≥Œ±Œ∏ŒøœÇ and Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÇ is omitted).Kraeling, Carl H. A Greek Fragment of Tatians's Diatessaron from Dura.

The fragment has two agreements with Syriac Sinaitic. First Syriac Sinaitic shares with Codex Bezae the reading Œ∑ŒΩ Œ¥Œµ Œ∑ Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ± for Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∑ŒºŒµœÅŒ± Œ∑ŒΩ, and secondly it describes Arimathaea as \\"city of Judea\\" instead of \\"city of the Jews\\".Kraeling, Carl H. A Greek Fragment of Tatians's Diatessaron from Dura. Studies and Documents 3 (London, 1935), pp. 36-37 The last reading is supported by other Syriac authorities, by Old-Latin Codex Veronensis, Vulgate, and the Arabic Harmony, against the entire Greek tradition.William Lawrence Petersen, Tatian's Diatessaron: its creation, dissemination, significance, and history in scholarship, Brill: Leiden 1994, p. 201 The fragment does not agree with the Syriac reading Ramtha for Arimethaea. The text-type of this manuscript is no longer classifiable, because of the Diatessaric character of text (likewise Papyrus 25). Even so, Aland placed it in Category III.

Significance of the manuscript  The surviving leaf of the scroll or codex described here, was found in 1933, during excavations among the ruins of Dura- Europos, known to have been destroyed by Shapur I King of Persia in 256. This means the manuscript must have been written before 256 (known as a terminus ad quem). The time between Tatian's original composition and the production of this copy could not have been longer than 80 years (though it could have been shorter).Bruce M. Metzger, The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission and Limitations, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977, pp. 11-12. Before this find, the only copies of the Diatessaron known to modern scholarship were translations into languages other than Greek‚Äînotably Latin, Arabic, and Armenian. This fragment is potentially much more direct evidence that Tatian composed his Diatessaron with great diligence. \\"Probably he worked from four separate manuscripts, one for each of the Gospels, and, as he brought together phrases, now from this Gospel and now that, he would no doubt cross out those phrases in the manuscripts from which he was copying.\\" The fragment does not help in the discussion of a Greek or Syriac origin of the Diatessaron. Burkitt pointed two differences between its text of Luke 23:51 and the Old Syriac manuscripts of the Gospels (the kingdom of Heaven ] the kingdom of God), in agreement with the accepted Greek text.F. C. Burkitt, The Dura Fragment of Tatian, JTS 1935 XXXVI, pp. 255-259 Baumstark, on the other hand, identified several presumed Syriasms in the diction, as well as the unusual spelling of Arimathea, ŒïœÅŒπŒΩŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ±ŒπŒ±, in terms of Syriac origin.

It is expected to be completed in late 2021 and then the existing building will be demolished. History The hospital has its origins in a Victorian country residence known as ‚ÄúHeatherfield‚Äù built in 1876, possibly for the Farrar family (whose motto 'Ferre va Ferme' appears over the front door). It was in the ownership of the Ponsonby family between 1881 and 1891, when the Hon. Ashley Ponsonby, a Justice of the Peace and cousin of Sir Henry Ponsonby, Equerry to Queen Victoria, and his family had their country seat there.

Formed in 2002, they quickly forged their own variation on the UK rock sound of the time, influenced by the likes of Hundred Reasons, Hell Is For Heroes and more obscure bands such as Handsome and the Boston-based outfit Cave In. They also name early 1990s bands such as Soundgarden as influences. In mid-2002 the band released their debut five-track EP, Extended Play, through indie label Alpha9. Four of the five tracks, \\"Ladies and Gentlemen\\", \\"State of Me\\", \\"Take Me Through\\" and \\"Narcolepsy\\" would later be re-recorded for their first album, The Western Mechanism. The fifth track, titled \\"Retainer\\", remains the only track to be exclusive to the EP. Although the band were quick to distance themselves from their first recording it gained them a sizable local following and attracted the attention of London-based label Visible Noise, who signed them in early 2003. The album The Western Mechanism was released in 2005 to great critical praise. However, despite continued support for the band from the rock press in the U.K, Days of Worth remained somewhat of an obscurity, and were eventually dropped by Visible Noise. They disbanded shortly after. The band members were: Simon Ellis Griffiths (vocals), Alex Jarczok (guitar), Chris Gane (guitar), Kerry Lambert (bass) and Andy Green (drums). Lambert went on to join the indie rock band Fin, and Griffiths joined post-hardcore band Radio Alcatraz in late 2010.

Watt's steam engine. These pieces of necessity money eased the coinage shortage then current in France and their technical and aesthetic quality was much superiour to mediocre base metal issues produced by official sources. In March 1792, the Monnerons went bankrupt and Pierre fled. His brother Augustin took over the business, but a law of 3 May 1792 forbade the production of money by private concerns.

What demographics are to people, firmographics are to organizations. However, Webster (2005) suggested that the term \\"firmographics\\" is a combination of demographics and geographics. Commonly used firmographics include SIC, company size and location. The term \\"firmographics\\" is mostly used in relation to a first step of nested approach or segmentation funnel, which was introduced by Shapiro and Bonoma in 1984. Goals and purposes Firmographics variables allow firms to consider the features of organizational behavior in detail, for instance in a particular industry. It is helpful when there is no significant difference between operating variables, purchasing approach, situational factors and personal characteristics of customers. Geodemographic segmentation is a logical starting point because #The data are obtainable through secondary sources, government agencies, or demographic vendors; #It provides a quick snapshot of a market‚Äîan understanding of market structure and potential customer segments; and #Target populations can be sampled to represent characteristics of the entire market at a much lower cost than other forms of business segmentation. However, Webster (2005) believed that this approach misses a set of essential variables. Moreover, a differentiation between segmentation bases of nested approach is too complicated.–£—ç–±—Å—Ç–µ—Ä, –§—Ä–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∏–∫. –û—Å–Ω–æ–≤—ã –ø—Ä–æ–º—ã—à–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–∞—Ä–∫–µ—Ç–∏–Ω–≥–∞/–§—Ä–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∏–∫ –£—ç–±—Å—Ç–µ—Ä.-–ú.–ñ –ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π –î–æ–º –ì—Ä–µ–±–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞, 2055. - 416 —Å. Historical development The first attempts to segment industrial markets were made in 1934. J. Frederick described five factors that should be considered when defining a component market: industry, product use, company buying habits, channels of distribution, and geographic location. The term emporographics was coined by Banting in the early 1970s and refers to the equivalent of demographics in the context of industrial markets (Gross, A.C., Banting, P.M., Meredith, L.N., and Ford, I.D.: Business Marketing. Houghton Mifflin, Boston, MA, 1993). However, now the term ‚Äúfirmographics‚Äù is increasingly widely used. Yoram Wind and Richard Cardozo in 1974 advocate a two-stage approach to industrial segmentation that consists of macrosegments and microsegments. They explain that macrosegments consist of key organizational characteristics such as size of the buying firm, SIC category, geographic location, and usage factors, hence, mostly of firm demographics. In some cases, single-stage segmentation based primarily on business demographics is sufficient for identifying and targeting markets. More typical, however, is that a two-stage approach that will employ benefits and organizational psychographics and purchasing criteria will be needed to provide complete market profiles. Firmographics play crucial role in one of the most significant developments in business segmentation theory came in 1984 with the work of Bonoma and Shapiro who were the first to propose a truly multistep basis for segmenting business markets. They proposed the use of five general segmentation criteria which they arranged in a nested hierarchy. The set of segmentation bases captures from macro-level to micro-level, and firmographics belong to the macro approach and comprise from industry, company size, customer location. Benefits and pitfalls It is not recommended to base segmentation solely on emporographics in the long term unless they reflect clear differences in needs, benefits, and product use. This is because the increasing competitive pressures observable in most organizational markets will, sooner or later, erode any industry structures not based on customer needs. Firmographics may bear little direct relation to user needs or purchase requirements and benefits. Curran and Goodfellow suggest that descriptor-based approaches are popular, because they are convenient, clear cut, easy to implement, and they result in boundaries that are relatively stable over time. Nevertheless, they add, such approaches are also arbitrary and usually are based largely on managerial judgment and intuition. It is easy for empirically oriented academics to underestimate the importance and value of managerial intuition, especially when this is based on experience. The attraction of descriptor-based or firmographic approaches is understandable in the circumstances and can provide useful and important insights to the practical issues of engaging with customers. More accurately, such emporographic variables facilitate such logistical issues of supplier convenience as minimizing sales or distribution costs and, perhaps, prices but this is not the principal reason for emporographic analysis. But these approaches provide little understanding of underlying customer needs and so do not constitute a sufficient basis for segmentation in unfamiliar or competitively challenging markets. This point is demonstrated in product development processes where sophisticated segmentation will provide ample insight to evolving customer needs into the future, while emporographic approaches will struggle even to describe historic customer needs. Variables Industry Industry firmographics refer to the activities of the firm. At a very high level, organizations can be classified into business and government segments. Most business activities are naturally constrained to certain industries due to their core competencies or the demands of the customers. Only a few business activities are not. Therefore, industry type becomes a natural market segmentation variable for businesses. Government organizations can be segmented by their federal, state, county, regional, city, and municipality status.http://www.wiglafjournal.com/marketing/2013/01/what-are-firmographics The dominant business segmentation variables are those associated with an NAICS or SIC code. NAICS refers to the North American Industry Classification System adapted by the U.S. Census bureau in 1997. SIC refers to the older Standard Industrial Classification system that was established in 1937. Either NAICS or SIC can be used to identify firms by industry. While most businesses use the newer NAICSS, many still work with the older SIC and both systems can be used with most modern business research reports and tools. Location Location firmographics refers to where the business is located. As a segmentation variable, firms may be aggregated by city, metropolitan statistical area, state, region, country, or continent. Alternatively, firms may be targeted according to their distance from a central location, usually the location of the firm conducting the sales and marketing effort. Most business activities are naturally constrained to certain regions due to competitive pressures, legal restrictions, and cost constraints. Only a few business activities are not. As such, location becomes a natural market segmentation variable for businesses. The nature of the industry plays a role if the location is of big importance. Businesses in a certain industry can therefore be compared with each other on location. Customer size Customer size in Firmographics refers to the size of clients the company has. This can range from small- to mid-size companies or Fortune 500 clients. (Korten, 2012) The size of customers companies aim for may distinguish one company from another. The basis for measuring the different size of customers is depending on which product or service is being purchased. For example, you have customers that purchase high volume because of low-priced product or customers that purchase low volume because of high-priced product. Status and structure Status and structure firmographics can refer to the relation of one organization to another, or it can refer to the legal status of an organization. For instance, individual establishments (also known as firms by the above definition) may be categorized as being independent businesses, part of a larger parent company, or the headquarters of a parent company. Similarly, firms may be categorized as being a stand-alone entity, a franchisee of a franchising organization, a subsidiary of a larger organization, or the outlet of a larger organization. Alternatively, firms may be categorized as being a sole proprietorship, limited liability corporation, limited liability partnership, private corporation, or public shareholder- owned corporation. Other variables describing the status or structure of an organization are used as well. Performance Performance firmographics refer to the characteristics of a firm related to its business execution over time. The duration of a firm‚Äôs existence, rate of growth or decline, profits and losses, and changes in profits and losses can all be indicators of the likelihood of a firm to need a business product or service. Firms in the same industry of relatively similar size but undergoing different rates of growth or decline are likely to have very different demands for business services. As such, they can form meaningful segmentation variables. Companies carrying put segmentation of their customers choose performance metrics based on the information they would like to acquire. That is why there may be no performance variable, but a group of variables that can be referred to as ¬´performance¬ª, such as: #Annual revenue: There‚Äôs usually a clear correlation between how significant a company‚Äôs annual earnings are, and whether a buyer would have money in the budget to afford doing business with a company. #Executive title: Which titles are proven most likely to need your products and/or services? #Average sales cycle: How long does the average sale take to close? What is the official dividing line between prospects who want to make a well-informed buying decision and those who have no real intention of buying.

In Moscow she met and married the Chinese communist poet Xiao San. In 1939, after twelve years in Moscow, Xiao was ordered to the revolutionary base at Yan'an; Sandberg was allowed to accompany him. The conductor Herbert Sandberg was her brother. Only White Woman at Yan'an The First Red Army and the Chinese Communist Party headquarters had been in northern Shaanxi for four years. Xiao, a Hunanese and an old classmate of Mao Zedong's, took over the editorial department at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts. Under the exacting conditions of the Second Sino-Japanese War Sandberg here bore Xiao two sons. She was the base's only resident western female although the reporter and spy Agnes Smedley was a visitor. After five years Sandberg returned to Moscow, taking her sons with her.Lescot 2005, p.274 After the Japanese surrender, the Chinese Civil War resumed. In March 1947 the Communists evacuated Yan'an and the National Revolutionary Army occupied it. Only in March 1949, with the leadership ensconced in a western suburb of Beijing, did Xiao board a train for Moscow with a delegation of writers; he was headed to Stockholm for committee work on the Geneva Conventions but very much looked forward to seeing his wife and children however briefly after four years. Only Three Soviet Women in China Reunited, the Xiao family returned to China. The first five-year plan of the People's Republic brought large- scale modernization to the country, but collectivization resulted in famine; doubts raised among the aghast planners were met with the Hundred Flowers Campaign, the Anti-Rightist Movement and a plan for the years 1958-62 called the Great Leap Forward. In this climate even Xiao San, Mao's boyhood friend, dared not write any poetry; given his history the family could not long hope to avoid the regime's xenophobia, mounting even as Mao relinquished the State Chairmanship in 1959. Eva Sandberg had laid aside her Leica and begun making films of the People's Republic for use by the communist news agencies of Europe. In 1962 it emerged that her travels in China had aroused suspicion. She came under pressure either to take Chinese citizenship or to leave the country. When her friend Nadia left Zhang Bao and returned to the Soviet Union, Sandberg knew there were only two other such prominent Soviet women remaining: Elisabeth (Lisa) Kishkin (ÊùéËéé), wife of Li Lisan, a Lubianka survivor, and Grania (Ê†ºÊãâÂ®ò), the uneducated wife of Chen Changhao (ÈôàÊòåÊµ©), a veteran of the alternate Long March of Zhang Guotao (purged 1937). The simple Grania was put on trial, as a Revisionist and Capitalist roader. Chang promptly divorced her, losing his son Victor, and was the prosecution's witness. Sandberg and Kishkin spoke in her defense. The charge of spying menaced all three women but could not be made to stick. For a few years they imagined nothing worse might come to Grania than the penury to which she as a single, visible-minority mother was reduced, and which they tried to alleviate. However, in 1966 Liu, the official State Chair was outfoxed by his resurgent predecessor. The Cultural Revolution brought douzhenghui violence to bear against the three Soviet wives and the men who had married them. Each was charged with, and made to confess to, various crimes. The following year the three couples, including the divorced Grania and Zhang Bao, were formally arrested. Li died within days of his arrest, on June 22, 1967; the others were to spend years in a Beijing prison and then years in enforced rustification, a sort of internal exile.

The name is derived from the solidus. Its longevity of use anchored it in many expressions of the French language.  Roman antiquity  The solidus is a coin made of 4.5 g of gold, created by emperor Constantine to replace the aureus.  Early Middle Ages  Doing honour to its name, the new currency earns the reputation of unalterability, crossing almost unchanged the decline and fall of the Western Roman Empire, the great invasions and the creation of Germanic kingdoms throughout Europe; not only was it issued in the Byzantine empire until the 11th century under the name of nomisma, but the solidus was imitated by the barbarian kings, particularly the Merovingians, albeit most often in the form of a \\"third of a sou\\" (tremissis). Saint Louis worth 1 sou tournois 1791, 30 sols depicting Louis XVI The last \\"sou\\" : 1939, French five centimes (actual ‚åÄ: 19 mm) Facing a shortage of gold, a new \\"stabilization\\" (as devaluations are often called) is introduced by Charlemagne: from then on the solidus no longer represents 1/12th of the Roman gold pound but 1/20th of the Carolingian silver pound instead. The sou itself is divided into 12 denarii and one denarius is worth 10 asses. But for rare exceptions (saint Louis' \\"gros\\"), the denarius will in practice be the only ones in circulation.Charlemagne - The Middle Ages on themiddleages.net. Charlemagne's general principle of 12 denarii worth one sol and of twenty sols worth one pound is kept with many variants according to the alloy used and the dual metal gold:silver sometimes used for some issues. In fact, only members of the money changers corporation could find their way among the equivalences and the many currencies used in Europe at each period, and therefore were unavoidable for many commercial operations.  Late Middle Ages  The name evolves as does the rest of the language, from Latin to French. Solidus becomes soldus, then solt in the 11th century, then sol in the 12th century. In the 18th century (Ancien R√©gime) the spelling of sol is adapted to sou so as to be closer to the pronunciation that had previously become the norm for several centuries.  Abolition and Legacy  In 1795, the livre was officially replaced by the franc and the sou became obsolete as an official currency division. Nevertheless, the term \\"sou\\" survived as a slang term for 1/20 of a franc. Thus the large bronze 5-centime coin was called \\"sou\\" (for example in Balzac or Victor Hugo), the \\"pi√®ce de cent sous\\" (\\"hundred sous coin\\") meant five francs and was also called \\"√©cu\\" (as in Zola's Germinal). The last 5-centime coin, remote souvenir inherited from the \\"franc germinal\\", is removed from circulation in the 1940s, but the word \\"sou\\" keeps being used (except for the 1960 new franc's five-centime coin which was worth five old francs).  Sous outside France   Canada  In Canada, the word \\"sou\\" is used in everyday language and means the division of the Canadian dollar. The official term is \\"cent\\". The one cent coins have the vernacular name of \\"sou noir\\" (\\"black sou\\") and the 25 cents that of \\"thirty sous\\". \\"√âchanger quatre trente sous pour une piastre\\" (\\"to exchange four 30 sous for one piastre\\") therefore means changing something for an identical thing, as the \\"piastre\\" is the common name for the Canadian dollar. Current five Swiss centimes  Switzerland  In Switzerland, a hundred-sou coin is a five-Swiss-franc coin and a four-sou coin is a twenty-Swiss-centime coin. The word sou also remains in informal language in the terms \\"ten, twenty ... sous\\".  The sou in French expressions  Used for over a thousand years, the word \\"sou\\" is deeply rooted in the French language and expressions. Les sous, plural, is a synonym for money. ¬´ Se faire des sous ¬ª, to make money. * ¬´Une affaire de gros sous ¬ª is big money business. * ¬´ √ätre sans le sou ¬ª, ¬´ ne pas avoir sou vaillant ¬ª, ¬´ n'a pas un sou en poche ¬ª, ¬´ n'avoir ni sou ni maille ¬ª:A \\"maille\\" is half a denarius. \\"not having one penny\\", having no money at all. * About one who is always short of money or always asking for some, one says that ¬´ Il lui manque toujours 3 sous pour faire un franc ¬ª (\\"he always lacks 3 sous to make up to one franc\\"). Sometimes it is said \\"missing 19 sous to have one franc\\", with one franc worth 20 sous; U.S. version: \\"he always needs a penny to have a round dollar\\". * ¬´ Je te parie cent sous contre un franc ¬ª (\\"I bet you 100 sous (5 francs) for 1 franc\\"), meaning \\"I am sure about (whatever the topic is)\\". * ¬´ Un sou est un sou ¬ª, there is no small profit, equivalent to \\"a penny saved is a penny earned\\". * ¬´ Sou par sou ¬ª or ¬´ sou √† sou ¬ª, little by little. * ¬´ √ätre pr√®s de ses sous ¬ª (\\"to be near one's money\\"), to be avaricious/tight-fisted. * ¬´ On lui donnerait cent sous √† le voir ¬ª, \\"one would give him 100 sous upon sight\\", for someone whose appearance inspires pity. * ¬´ S'ennuyer ¬´ √† cent sous l'heure ¬ª or ¬´ √† cent sous de l'heure ¬ª, being very bored. * When something is worth ¬´ trois francs six sous ¬ª, it is very cheap. * ¬´ Un objet de quatre sous ¬ª (\\"a two-penny item\\") is of even lesser value, thus the \\"3 Groschen Opera from Brecht has become \\"l'Op√©ra de 4 sous\\". * When one ¬´ n'a pas deux sous de jugeote ¬ª, one \\"doesn't have an ounce of common sense\\". * A ¬´ machine √† sous ¬ª is a hole in the wall (an ATM‚Äîits slightly more formal name is \\"distributeur\\"). * ¬´ Le sou du franc ¬ª (\\"the penny off the pound\\"), a sweetener for a buyer. * ¬´ Pas ambigu/fier/modeste/courageux/... pour un sou ¬ª is \\"not at all ambiguous/proud/modest/courageous/...\\".

Note the steam dome, a typically German feature, and also the corrugated furnaces. A \\"Scotch\\" marine boiler (or simply Scotch boiler) is a design of steam boiler best known for its use on ships. Sectional diagram of a \\"wet back\\" boiler The general layout is that of a squat horizontal cylinder. One or more large cylindrical furnaces are in the lower part of the boiler shell. Above this are many small-diameter fire-tubes. Gases and smoke from the furnace pass to the back of the boiler, then return through the small tubes and up and out of the chimney. The ends of these multiple tubes are capped by a smokebox, outside the boiler shell. The Scotch boiler is a fire-tube boiler, in that hot flue gases pass through tubes set within a tank of water. As such, it is a descendant of the earlier Lancashire boiler, and like the Lancashire it uses multiple separate furnaces to give greater heating area for a given furnace capacity. It differs from the Lancashire in two aspects: many small- diameter tubes (typically diameter each) are used to increase the ratio of heating area to cross-section. Secondly, the overall length of the boiler is halved by folding the gas path back on itself.  Combustion chamber  Inside the combustion chamber, looking up at the tubeplate Mayflower, showing the stays supporting the combustion chambers The far end of the furnace is an enclosed box called the combustion chamber which extends upwards to link up with the firetubes. The front wall of the combustion chamber is supported against steam pressure by the tubes themselves. The rear face is stayed by rod stays through the rear shell of the boiler. Above the combustion chamber and tubes is an open steam collecting space. Larger long rod stays run the length of the boiler through this space, supporting the ends of the boiler shell. With multiple furnaces, there is a separate combustion chamber for each furnace. A few small boilers did connect them into one chamber, but this design is weaker. A more serious problem is the risk of reversing the draught, where exhaust from one furnace could blow back and out of the adjacent one, injuring the stokers working in front of it.  Origins  'Wilberforce' boiler in section The first recorded boiler of comparable form was used in a railway locomotive, Hackworth's 'Wilberforce' class of 1830. This had a long cylindrical boiler shell similar to his earlier return-flued 'Royal George' , but with the return flue replaced by a number of small firetubes, as had been demonstrated so effectively by Stephenson with his 'Rocket' a year earlier. The novel feature of an entirely internal combustion chamber was used. Unlike the later Scotch boiler though, this was self-supported by its own stays, rather than using stays through the walls of the boiler shell. This allowed the entire assembly of outer tubeplate, furnace tube, combustion chamber and firetubes to all be removed from the boiler shell as one unit, simplifying manufacture and maintenance. Although a valuable feature, this became impractical for larger diameter chambers that would require the support of the shell.  Variants   Number of furnaces  Typical practice for ships was to have two furnaces in each boiler. Smaller boilers might only have one, larger boilers commonly had three. The limitation in boiler size was the amount of work each stoker could do, firing one furnace per man. Larger ships (meaning anything above the smallest) would have many boilers. As with the Lancashire boiler, the furnace was often corrugated for strength. Various makers had their own particular ways of making these corrugations, leading to their classification for maintenance purposes under the broad titles of, Leeds, Morrison, Fox, Purves or Brown.  Wet back and dry back  Cross and longitudinal section of a four-furnace boiler The typical design is the \\"wet back\\", where the rear face of the combustion chamber is water-jacketed as a heating surface. The \\"dry back\\" variation has the rear of the combustion chamber as an open box, backed or surrounded by only a sheet-metal jacket.Malek, Power Boilers, p.244 This simplifies construction, but also loses much efficiency. It is used for only small boilers where capital cost outweighs fuel costs. Although the Scotch boiler is nowadays rarely the primary steam generator on a ship, small dry-back designs such as the Minipac are still encountered, for supporting secondary demands whilst alongside in port with the main boilers cold. One interesting variant of the dry-back design has been a patent for burning ash-prone fuels. Fire-tube boiler, with ash removal The rear of the combustion chamber is used as an access point for an ash separator, removing the ash before the small-diameter tubes.  Double-ended  The double-ended design places two boilers back-to-back, removing the rear wall of the boiler shell. The combustion chambers and firetubes remain separate. This design saves some structural weight, but it also makes the boiler longer and more difficult to install into a ship. For this reason they were not commonly used, although back-to-back arrangements of multiple single-ended boilers were common.  Inglis  The \\"Inglis\\" modification adds an extra combustion chamber where an additional single large flue returns from the rear to the front of the boiler. Flow through the multiple tubes is thus from front to back, and so the exhaust is at the rear. Multiple furnaces would share a single combustion chamber. The major advantage of the Inglis is the extra heating area it adds, for a comparable shell volume, of perhaps 20%. Surprisingly this is not from the additional combustion chamber, but from lengthening the narrow firetubes. These can now run the full length of the boiler shell, rather than just the rather shorter distance from the inner combustion chamber to the front tubeplate. Despite this advantage, it is rarely used.  Use in ships  Willamette Iron and Steel Works advertisement noting large Emergency Fleet Corporation boiler orders. The Scotch marine boiler achieved near-universal use throughout the heyday of steam propulsion, particularly for the most highly developed piston engines such as the triple-expansion compounds. It lasted from the end of the low-pressure haystack boilers in the mid-19th century through to the early 20th century and the advent of steam turbines with high-pressure water-tube boilers such as the Yarrow. Large or fast ships could require a great many boilers. The Titanic had 29 boilers: 24 double-ended and 5 smaller single- ended. The larger boilers were diameter and long, the smaller were in length. All had three corrugated Morrison furnaces of diameter, 159 furnaces in total, and a working pressure of .  Shipboard working examples  Numerous Scotch boilers are in use on ships as of 2011, and new boilers can be built to replace life-expired ones.

T. Joshi, Greenwood Press, 2006. p. 123 Plot The story opens with a quotation from a letter written by Lovecraft on 7-23-'34. By omitting the word \\"kitten\\" it is made to suggest something hideous. In the story, an author ‚Äî whose literary career has been in the shadow of H. P. Lovecraft and modeled after Lovecraft Circle member Frank Belknap Long \\\\- becomes involved in a mystery after a chance encounter with a missionary named Mortimer while traveling on an airplane. The missionary, traveling in disguise, is fleeing something he encountered while in Malaysia, and refers to the Chaucha. Later, while visiting a museum, the author comes across a reference to the Chaucha. The narrator realizes that the Chaucha are actually the Tcho-Tcho, which he had previously thought to be a fictional construct of Lovecraft. Slowly, the narrator becomes threatened by a being (possibly an avatar of Nyarlathotep) the Tcho-Tcho worship: a black, fish-like humanoid demon called the Shugoran (roughly \\"Questing Man\\") with an appendage that resembles a horn attached to its face. There are implications that the Tcho-Tcho have a practice of growing something within human bodies, a practice which results in the narrator's brush with a Malaysian on the airplane leaving a treacly smell on his clothing. Later, in a museum, the narrator smells the same treacly smell and is told that it is molasses - a pure culture used to grow things. The narrator's attempts to track down what has happened to Mortimer, after Mortimer goes missing during a hurricane. A disturbing clue turns up in his bedroom. The story ends with his frightened next door neighbor having seen a black face at her window, something like a man wearing a gas mask or a snorkel. The narrator wonders how long it will be until the thing comes for him.

Family and education Frederick Llewellyn- Jones was born at Bethesda, Caernarfonshire. He received his education at Friars School, Bangor and Bala College. He then attended University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. He obtained BA degrees from the Universities of Wales and London and the law degree LLB from London. Later in life he received the Honorary degree of Doctor of Political Science from the University of P√©cs in Hungary. In 1892 he married Elizabeth Roberts from Ruthin. They had three sons and two daughters.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Career Llewellyn-Jones was admitted as a solicitor in 1891. Over the years he was a member of a number of domestic and international organisations connected to the law, including the International Law Association from 1912‚Äì39, the Grotius Society of London from 1915‚Äì39, the American Society of International Law, other English and foreign Peace and International Law Societies, the Society of Comparative Legislation and Soci√©t√© de L√©gislation Compar√©e of Paris and the Medico-Legal Society of London, 1915‚Äì38. He took a particular interest in National Insurance and health matters. He was Chairman of Flintshire Insurance Committee, 1912‚Äì40; the President (1937‚Äì38) of the Association of Welsh Insurance Committees and President of the Federation of English, Scottish, and Welsh Insurance Committees, 1924‚Äì26, 1929‚Äì31, and 1934‚Äì37. He was appointed by the National Insurance Commissioners and Ministry of Health to be a member of successive Advisory Committees and of the Welsh Consultative Health Council. He also served as a member of the Central Council for Health Education, 1923‚Äì40. For many years he served as HM Coroner for Flintshire.The Times, 18.1.41 Politics In 1914 he was selected as the Liberal party prospective parliamentary candidate for Preston. However, by early 1918 he had relinquished that role and announced his intention to contest the University of Wales as a Labour candidate.\\"Labour Candidate For University.\\" Times [London, England] 12 Feb. 1918: 3. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 10 Feb. 2014. Llewellyn-Jones was elected Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Flintshire at the 1929 general election. However, in 1931 an economic crisis led to the formation of a National Government led by Labour Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. The government was initially supported by the Conservative and Liberal parties, and a rump of National Labour MPs. However the Liberals were increasingly divided over the existence of the National Government, particularly over the issue Free Trade. The official party led by Sir Herbert Samuel, although agreeing to go into the 1931 general election supporting the government became more and more worried about the government's stance on Free Trade and concerned about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition. However a group of Liberal MPs led by Sir John Simon who were concerned to ensure the National Government had a wide cross-party base, formed the Liberal National Party to more openly support MacDonald's administration. Llewellyn-Jones was one of 22 Liberal MPs who met in ‚Äòsecret conclave‚Äô on the evening of 5 October 1931. The meeting resolved to form itself into a body to give firm support to the prime minister as the head of a national government and for the purpose of fighting a general election. Sir John Simon wrote to the Prime Minister that night to give him the news and the decision was made to call the group Liberal Nationals.David Dutton, Liberal Schism: A History of the National Liberal Party; I B Tauris, 2008 p40 After that, Llewellyn-Jones sat in the House of Commons as a Liberal National. At the 1931 general election, when the official and Liberal National groups were still both supporting the government, Llewellyn-Jones was not opposed in Flintshire either by a Free Trade Liberal or Conservative candidate. However, there was opposition to his decision to associate with the Liberal Nationals within the Flintshire Liberal Association. At the meeting held to discuss the general election, Llewellyn-Jones threw down the gauntlet to the Association proclaiming that whether or not they adopted him he would stand anyway, secure in the knowledge that the Conservatives had already agreed not to put up a candidate in the seat. The atmosphere at the meeting was reported as ‚Äòstormy‚Äô by The Times but Llewellyn-Jones got the support of more than half those voting at the meeting.The Times, 15.10.31 An interesting detail from the election was the public support offered to Llewellyn-Jones by Henry Neville Gladstone, the only surviving son of the great Liberal statesman William Ewart Gladstone whose family home, Hawarden Castle, was located in the constituency.The Times, 26.10.31 On election day, Llewellyn-Jones found himself opposed only by the Labour Party candidate Miss F Edwards and he was returned to Parliament with the massive majority of 24, 247 votes.The Times, 29.10.31 Changing back and resignation While he gained election as a Liberal National with Conservative assent and joined the Liberal National group in the House of Commons, Llewellyn-Jones was not mere coalition lobby- fodder. In 1932 he resigned from the Liberal National group and re-took the Liberal whip. In November 1932 a vote of no confidence in him was passed by the Flintshire Conservatives,The Times, 8.11.32 for persistently voting against the government on fiscal matters, including the Ottawa Agreements.The Times, 3.12.32 In February 1934, Llewellyn-Jones issued a statement to the effect that he would not stand again at the next general election on the grounds of age and the need for new blood in the constituency.The Times, 16.2.34 Welsh education and culture Llewellyn-Jones was closely associated with Welsh life and in particular the promotion of education and culture. He was Chairman of the Holywell School Board 1898‚Äì1904, a member of Flintshire Joint Education Committee; a Member of the Court of Governors of the University Colleges of Wales, Aberystwyth and Bangor as well as serving as a member of the Welsh University Court and the Court of Governors of the National Library of Wales and of the Welsh National Museum. He also served as the President of the Welsh League of Nations Union in 1933 and in support of Welsh language and culture, he was a member of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion and of the Gorsedd of the National Eisteddfod of Wales.

Jean Honor√© Robert de Paul de Lamanon, known as Robert de Lamanon (6 December 1752, Salon-de-Provence ‚Äì 11 December 1787, Tutuila, Island of Maouna, Samoan Islands) was a French botanist, physicist, geologist and meteorologist. He joined several scientific expeditions and eventually died on one (the La Perouse expedition). Family He belonged to the lordly family of Lamanon, ennobled in 1572. His father was Jean Fran√ßois de Paul de Lamanon and Anne de Baldony (born in Aix-en-Provence). He had two sisters and an elder brother, Auguste Paul de Lamanon (1748‚Äì1820). Auguste was destined for the French Navy by his father, becoming a garde de la marine at Toulon, then an officer. Life Robert's brother Auguste left the Navy on his father's death to devote himself to the study of sciences and letters. Robert left holy orders and together they set out on a trip round Europe and the French provinces collecting plants, documents, manuscripts and objets d'art. They perfected their studies in Paris and there met the most famous scholars of the era : Laplace, Jussieu, d'Alembert, the Monge brothers, Volney, Malesherbes, and Condorcet, secretary of the Acad√©mie des sciences. Robert's paper on fossils found in the gypsum formation around Paris, Observations sur la Physique, contributed to practice of turning physical geography into geohistory. The practice was still novel at the time, Nicolas Desmarest (1725-1815) publishing his essay on recognizing prismatic basalt as old lava streams only three years before in 1774. Reported to be \\"energetic and full of lively curiosity,\\" on a trip from Paris to England, Robert ordered himself to be tied to the mainmast during a violent storm so that he could contemplate the spectacle.

A column of bay windows rises from the basement to the tenth floor; a classic style entrance is in the center of the front fa√ßade. The building originally had classical details on the upper floors, including a cornice and false balconies, that have been removed. Significance and History The Pasadena Apartments was constructed in 1902 from a design by Mortimer L. Smith. The building is an early example of upper-class, multi-unit housing, and is one of the earliest of these structures to be built with reinforced concrete. The building was constructed at a time when newly wealthy families associated with Detroit's industrial boom were appearing, yet financing requirements for private homes were substantial. These families often preferred to rent upscale apartments. The Pasadena is notable for its scale, design, and materials. The building is still used as apartment space, and is operated by MFG Detroit.

Its three chapters were absorbed by Alpha Omicron Pi.  History  At the end of the spring semester in 1895, six female students at Tufts University drew up plans for Alpha Delta Sigma. In October of the same year, the constitution and bylaws were drafted. Initiations were held on November 14 and December 9 (Start, p. 231). The badge was a \\"square pin of blue enamel displaying the letters\\". The official colors were blue and gold (Baird's 1898). This chapter became the Alpha chapter of Delta Sigma. Alpha Delta Sigma existed as a separate group from Delta Sigma, Alpha chapter. Baird's (1905) maintained a separate entry for ADS, with membership at 33. Delta Sigma, with Alpha, Beta, and Gamma chapters, are listed among the national sororities. Seventy seven women were members of the Alpha chapter (Baird's 1905, p. 314). Female students at Brown University created Delta Sigma in 1896. Martha Mitchell described the sorority as \\"formed as a local organization in 1896, and merged in 1901 with another local society, Alpha Delta Sigma at Tufts\\" (Encyclopedia Brunoniana). Baird's(1905)described this merger as \\"the outcome of ŒëŒîŒ£ (local at Tufts) and ŒîŒ£ at Brown\\". Thus, Brown's Delta Sigma is now the Beta chapter. The Maine chapter began as Phi Gamma in 1896. It joined Delta Sigma as the Gamma chapter in 1903. Five years later, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma were absorbed by Alpha Omicron Pi (Fernald, p. 24). Delta Sigma ceased to exist as a separate entity.  Insignia  The official colors were pale green and white. The flower was the violet (Phi Delta Theta, 1907). The badge was \\"a square of black enamel with concave sides outlined in gold, and displaying the letters 'ŒîŒ£' in gold. This square is encircled by a jeweled golden circle\\" (Baird's 1905).

The band Frankie Goes to Hollywood took their name from Peellaert's painting, titled Frank Sinatra, which featured the headline \\"Frankie Goes Hollywood\\". Biography Guy Peellaert's design for David Bowie's Diamond Dogs album Peellaert was born into an aristocratic family, but left home at an early age. He studied fine arts in Brussels, and became heavily influenced by American and British pop culture, film noir and pulp literature, before making his debut as a decorator for theaters and comic strip artist.\\"Guy Peellaert, The Michelangelo of Pop Art\\" His style was influenced by psychedelic art and Pop Art. He moved to Paris, where he worked variously in advertising, set design for the casino and the Crazy Horse nightclub, film and television. His comic strip, Les Aventures de Jodelle, was published in 1966 in the controversial French magazine Hara- Kiri.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/p/peellaert.htm The protagonist, Jodelle, was modelled after singer Sylvie Vartan. A year later in 1967 he makes his second pop art comic book Pravda, also prepublished in Hara Kiri. The main character of this book is based on Francoise Hardy. In 1973, he collaborated with British rock journalist Nik Cohn on the best-selling book Rock Dreams, which reportedly sold a million copies after it was published the following year. The book consisted of Peellaert's visual illustrations which celebrated and exaggerated the rebel heritage of pop music and, particularly, rock and roll, with commentary by Cohn. Many of the original artworks were bought by actor Jack Nicholson. After the success of Rock Dreams, Peellaert became perhaps best known for his rock album covers. He designed covers for The Rolling Stones (It's Only Rock 'n' Roll), David Bowie (Diamond Dogs), √âtienne Daho (Pour nos vies martiennes), Lio (Wandatta), and others. He painted in a very photorealistic style and often used pastel. The album cover of David Bowie's Diamond Dogs (1974) met with controversy. The cover art features Bowie as a striking half-man, half-dog grotesque. It was controversial as the full painting clearly showed the hybrid's genitalia. Very few copies of this original cover made their way into circulation at the time of the album's release. According to the record-collector publication Goldmine price guides, these albums have been among the most expensive record collectibles of all time, as high as thousands of US dollars for a single copy. The genitalia was quickly airbrushed out for the 1974 LP's gatefold sleeve, although the original artwork (and another rejected cover featuring Bowie in a cordobes hat holding onto a ravenous dog) was included in subsequent Rykodisc/EMI re- issues. Peellaert also designed film posters for films like Taxi Driver (by Martin Scorsese), Short Cuts (by Robert Altman), L'argent (by Robert Bresson), Paris, Texas and Wings of Desire (by Wim Wenders) He also designed programme titles for television shows on the French TV channel Antenne 2 in 1982. Peellaert and Cohn collaborated again on 20th-Century Dreams in 1999, with illustrations of political and world historical figures. His work has been exhibited internationally and magazines like Les Inrockuptibles, The Guardian and Vanity Fair have praised his work. He died at the age of 74 of cancer.

Alteration processes such as weathering can influence the physical character and chemical composition of matter near the surface, without affecting the bulk medium beneath. Increases in porosity can increase light refraction, diffuse reflection and scattering, resulting in a brightening of the material's surface. Besides the physical changes, chemical differences compared to the bulk medium may be involved. Because of increased gas‚Äìsolid interfaces which result, for example due to selective leaching processes during burial, surfaces of ancient ceramics can appear brighter than they originally were.

Faced with a flush of applications from local residents, a junior department was opened, and a one-acre plot of ground, \\"The Firs\\", at the corner of Campground and Rouwkoop Roads was purchased for ¬£1900. New school buildings were erected and teaching began there in September 1898. Two years later Mr Ramage bought a local property which had been named Canigou Estate after an imposing monastery located high in the Pyrenees. This became a school hostel. The school flourished and, by 1927, had an enrollment of 568 boys. The Preparatory School's first headmaster, Mr WH \\"Papa\\" Law (1930-1943) was a Yorkshireman who was previously head of the large Tembuland Teachers' Training College where Nelson Mandela once studied. He was followed by Mr JCR Enslin (1943-1966) who guided the school through its change of site in 1948. The next incumbent was Mr RD Holmes (1967-1972), who remained at the helm until his appointment to the inspectorate. He was succeeded by former staff member Mr DM Laidlaw (1972-1987), an ex-RAF pilot, whose innovations included a science room, a computer centre and a 'Magnet' class for extending the brighter senior pupils. Mr Bruce Lane (1987-1997), the fifth headmaster, oversaw the major renovations which were completed in 1994. He was headmaster in the centenary year of 1997.

The Foundation focuses primarily on three areas in which Stanton was unable to complete his philanthropic plans within his lifetime: (1) supporting the First Amendment and creating a more informed citizenry, particularly in regard to civic issues, (2) supporting policy research in international security, with special emphasis on nuclear security and (3) advancing canine welfare. The Stanton Foundation is primarily a \\"no unsolicited proposals\\" foundation, although it operates several open application programs as detailed on its website. History The Stanton Foundation is the creation of Frank Stanton, who served as president of CBS from 1946 through 1971, and, following his retirement from CBS, as chairman of the American Red Cross, chairman of the Harvard Kennedy School's Visiting Committee, trustee of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Stanford, California, Harvard Overseer, trustee of the Museum of Broadcasting, and chairman of the RAND Corporation. He died in December 2006 at the age of 98. Upon his death, he provided funding for the Stanton Foundation, a New York Foundation and successor to the previously unfunded Ruth and Frank Stanton Fund. The Stanton Foundation began grant-making activity in 2009. Its early grants included funding for the Stanton Nuclear Security Fellows and for strengthening Wikipedia's technology infrastructure. Activities/Mission The Stanton Foundation's mission is to complete Frank Stanton's philanthropic agenda. The areas it funds are three: Informed Citizens/First Amendment, Nuclear Security, and Canine Welfare. Informed Citizens/First Amendment =Informed Citizens= The Foundation's interests include classic and twenty-first century First Amendment issues and the larger challenge of the creation of a better informed citizenry. Major grants in this area include two technology grants to the Wikimedia Foundation to improve Wikipedia's ease of use ($890,000) and the development of the Visual Editor ($3.6 million), and a $1.2 million grant to improve the quality of public policy articles. A grant of $1.39 million was made to the Wiki Education Foundation, a Wikipedia spinoff. Numerous small grants are also made to innovative high school teachers in U.S. History and Civics. =First Amendment= Frank Stanton was generally praised for his \\"passionate and courageous commitment to a free press.\\" Major grants in this area include: a First Amendment professorship at Stanford Law School, the creation of First Amendment Fellowships at Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP), and, jointly with the Knight Foundation, at Yale Law School's Media freedom and Information Access Clinic. Nuclear Security Within the general area of international security, the Foundation has a very strong emphasis on nuclear security issues. It defines nuclear security as including nuclear terrorism, nuclear proliferation, nuclear weapons, nuclear force posture, and, as it relates to nuclear security, nuclear energy. Major grants in this area include two nuclear security professorships at Stanford, and one at MIT in the Political Science department, currently held by Frank Gavin. It also funds postdoctoral Stanton Nuclear Security Fellows six major research centers, including the Carnegie Endowment, Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, RAND, and Stanford. Canine Welfare The Foundation's support for canine health and welfare includes both research and traditional grant programs to promote the welfare of dogs and strengthen the human/dog bond. The Foundation is pragmatic in its orientation and strives to approach the question of, \\"What is good for the dog?\\" without preconception. The Foundation has several open application programs in this area. Major grants and programs include the Center for Shelter Dogs at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine, and a professorship in canine health and welfare at Ohio State College of Veterinary Medicine. The Foundation also funds post doctoral research fellows at Duke's Center for Canine Cognition and other research and academic institutions, both in the US and abroad. Its open application programs include support for the establishment of K9 units in local police departments, the creation of dog parks in Massachusetts communities, and acquisition of mobile adoption vans. Controversies In 2012, the Foundation provided funds for a paid Wikipedian in residence at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. This became controversial due to links between the Belfer Center and the Stanton Foundation (the directors of each are married) and ongoing concerns about conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia.

He is the former manager of the Galway senior hurling team. An effective centre-back, McIntyre enjoyed a relatively successful playing career at club level with Lorrha-Dorrha and at inter-county level with Tipperary. He was a member of the latter team for a number of seasons in the 1980s, when Tipperary were going through an uncharacteristic drought in terms of championship success. After his playing days ended McIntyre gained notoriety as a manager and coach at all levels. A successful stint as coach working alongside manager Billy McGrath of the Clarinbridge club team in Galway followed his first term as manager of the Offaly senior hurling team in the 1990s. McIntyre returned as Offaly manager almost a decade later before being appointed manager of the Galway senior hurling team in November 2008. Playing career Club McIntyre played his club hurling with his local team Lorrha-Dorrha and enjoyed some success during the 1980s. In 1984 he captured a north Tipperary divisional title in 1984. This victory paved the way for Lorrha-Dorrha to advance to the final of the county senior championship. Moycarkey-Borris provided the opposition on that occasion, however, McIntyre's side could not match them. A 2‚Äì8 to 0‚Äì9 score line resulted in defeat for the north Tipp club. In spite of this, Lorrha-Dorrha were named club of the year in 1984, the centenary year of the Gaelic Athletic Association. McIntyre added a second north Tipperary title to his collection in 1989. Inter-county McIntyre first came to prominence on the inter- county scene as a member of the Tipperary under-21 hurling team in the early 1980s. That year Tipp were hoping to capture a third All-Ireland under-21 title in-a-row. McIntyre was a key member of the team that claimed the Munster title following a 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì10 defeat of arch-rivals Cork. Tipperary later qualified for the All-Ireland final and McIntyre was once again named in the centre-back position on the team. Kilkenny provided the opposition, however, Tipp had too much for their near neighbours and fierce rivals. A final score of 2‚Äì16 to 1‚Äì10 meant that McIntyre had picked up an All-Ireland under-21 winners' medal. McIntyre subsequently joined the Tipperary senior inter-county team, making his championship debut in a Munster quarter-final against Clare in 1983. It was a n uncharacteristic lean period for Tipp. In his second season McIntyre lined out in his first Munster final. Cork provided the opposition and were going for a third provincial title in succession. Tipperary were hoping to win their first since 1971. With four minutes remaining Tipperary led by four points and the hoodoo looked set to end. Cork's Se√°nie O'Leary and Tony O'Sullivan had a different idea. Two quick goals clinched a 4‚Äì15 to 3‚Äì14 victory and McIntyre's side were defeated once again. In 1985 Tipperary and Cork went to battle in the Munster decider once again. On this occasion there was no nail-biting finish as Cork secured a 4‚Äì17 to 4‚Äì11 victory and McIntyre found himself on the losing side for the second time. By 1986 McIntyre was relegated to the substitutes' bench and was replaced at centre-back by Noel Sheehy. He came on as a replacement in Tipp's Munster semi-final defeat by Clare. This was his last game with Tipperary. Managerial career Clarinbridge In 2001 McIntyre was recruited to the Clarinbridge senior hurling team as coach. It was a successful year for the club, as Clarinbridge reached the final of the county senior championship. Reigning All-Ireland club champions Athenry provided the opposition and were the favourites going into the game. Former Galway star Darragh Coen scored a point from a disputed free deep into injury time to secure a deserved 0‚Äì18 to 2‚Äì11 victory for McIntyre's side. It was Calrinbridge's first county title. The club subsequently reached the Connacht club final. Four Roads of Roscommon provided the opposition, however, Clarinbridge were too strong and won the game by 2‚Äì18 to 1‚Äì6. McIntyre's side later defeated Ballygunner in the All- Ireland semi-final to set up a championship decider meeting with Birr. That game at Semple Stadium saw Birr take complete control and defeat Clarinbridge by 2‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì5. Offaly In late 1996 McIntyre became involved in inter- county management for the first time when he took charge of the Offaly senior team. His term in charge was not a successful one. After an average National League campaign Offaly subsequently had an unlucky Leinster semi-final defeat by Wexford. McIntyre's side lost that game by three points on a day when it took a fantastic save by Damien Fitzhenry to prevent Billy Dooley from scoring an equalising goal in injury-time. He was subsequently ousted as manager and replaced by fellow county-man Michael 'Babs' Keating. McIntyre was appointed Offaly manager for the second time on 15 November 2004. By this stage Offaly was no longer the hurling power that it was in the 1980s and 1990s. His first season on charge was far from successful. After a 6‚Äì28 to 0‚Äì15 thrashing by Kilkenny in the Leinster semi-final, McIntyre's side later crashed out of the championship in the All-Ireland qualifier group stage. By 2006 little had changed. After a defeat by Wexford in the Leinster semi-final, McIntyre's side later exited the championship in the All-Ireland qualifier group stage once again. 2007 saw the pattern continue with Offaly being defeated in the semi- final stage of the provincial championship. A defeat of Dublin in the qualifiers failed to save McIntyre's side from being dumped out of the championship. He resigned as manager shortly afterwards. Galway McIntyre was confirmed as manager of the Galway senior hurling team, in succession to Ger Loughnane, on 18 November 2008. There were high hopes for Galway as the team entered the Leinster championship for the first time. After a trouncing of Laois in the opening round, McIntyre's Galway faced three-in-a-row All- Ireland champions Kilkenny in the provincial semi-final. Galway went five points ahead but 'the Cats' clawed their way back to win by 2‚Äì20 to 3‚Äì13. Galway later defeated Clare and Cork before being surprisingly defeated by Waterford in an All-Ireland quarter-final. In May 2010, he guided Galway to win the 2010 National Hurling League with a 2‚Äì22 to 1‚Äì17 win against Cork at Semple Stadium. In September 2011 McIntyre resigned as manager after a very disappointing season.

The group's stated purpose is to \\"Practice random kindness and senseless acts of beauty\\", a phrase first coined by Anne Herbert. History The Kindness Offensive was formed in August 2008, when three of the four founding members (David Goodfellow, Benny Crane and James Hunter) asked members of the public in Hampstead what \\"random acts of kindness\\" they would like done for them. They received many requests from the public, and the group attempted to meet some of them by contacting companies and persuading them to donate the required goods for free, a technique developed by fourth founding member Robert Williams and referred to by the group as \\"phone whispering\\". TKO attracted press attention in October 2008 for giving away twenty-five tonnes of non-perishable foods to fourteen soup kitchens and drop-in centres across London England; the event came to be known as 'The Mountain of Food'. This event was the first of many large-scale events centred on distributing industrial quantities of goods in short periods of time to a wide variety of locations and causes; the most notable of these were The Vinspired Kindness Offensive (2008), The White Stuff Kindness Offensive, which was widely reported as a record-breaking event (2010), The Barclaycard Kindness Offensive (2011) the Hasbro Kindness Offensive (2013), and the Read Free! Kindness Offensive. The large scale 2014 XL Catlin Kindness Offensive event resulted in the events organiser and group co-founder David Goodfellow being awarded with a Points of Light, https://www.pointsoflight.gov.uk/winner-search- results/?first_name=david+&last;_name=Goodfellow&location;=&date;_won=&theme;=Points of Light award by the then UK Prime Minister David Cameron who ackoloeged that it generated \\"...a record-breaking Christmas toy donation\\". As well as large giveaways, TKO has also staged a series of pop-up events, including The Everyday Kindness Awards in 2009.

Competing in two Summer Olympics, he won two silver medals at Rome in 1960, earning them in the K-1 4 √ó 500 m and the K-2 1000 m events. Szente also won two silver medals at the ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships (K-1 4 √ó 500 m: 1966, K-4 1000 m: 1958). Biography Szente Andr√°s V was born on December 10, 1939, in Budapest, Hungary to Szente Erzsebet (Schmidt) and Szente Andr√°s IV. Andr√°s was one of four children with an older sister named Katalin and younger twin brothers named Istv√°n and J√≥zsef. His father owned his own hair salon and was a well-known hairstylist in Budapest with a client list that included some of the most famous opera and movie stars of the time. In his early teens Andr√°s took up the sport of kayaking, which is a national pastime for the Hungarian people. He quickly rose through the competitive ranks becoming first a national champion, then a European champion, world champion, and finally a two-time Olympian winning two silver medals in the 1960 Rome Olympics and placing fourth in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Andr√°s saw his sports career as a ticket to travel the world, traveling all throughout Europe with his teammates and visiting distant countries that the average Hungarian only dreamed of because travel was strictly limited during communist rule. In 1956, when Andr√°s was only in his late teens and in high school, he participated in the uprising when the Hungarian people revolted against their communist dictators. Many years later, after he had defected to California, Andr√°s would commemorate the anniversary of the ‚Äô56 uprising and would reflect back that many of his classmates that went out to protest that day never came home because they lost their lives. In 1969 Andr√°s defected communist Hungary, traveling to Germany where he worked with American aid workers until he was given permission to come to the United States. Upon arriving in America, Andr√°s quickly integrated into the large Hungarian-American community in Los Angeles, California, joining a youth dance group where he would meet his future wife, √Ågnes Zerinv√°ri. Andr√°s pursued √Ågnes for two years until they fell in love and were married on August 26, 1972. The two were adventurous from the outset, traveling across the United States with their Dalmatian and camper in tow, and later traveled extensively throughout the world. On February 23, 1981, √Ågnes and Andr√°s gave birth to twin boys, and would raise their young family in California. Andr√°s died on September 14, 2012, at the age of 72 while vacationing with √Ågnes in Florida.

It crosses the Dinaric Alps via the Vratnik pass ( above sea level) between Senj and Brinje and the Kapela Pass between Brinje and Modru≈°. Vratnik pass, currently a part of the D23 road, was already in use during Roman time as a salt road, and it became important for timber and other goods in the Middle Ages. However, the first well documented road built along the route was Via Josephina named after Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor who commissioned its construction in 1775. Latin inscriptions carved in rock along the original Via Josephina route completed in 1779 testify that the Emperor travelled through the Vratnik pass on horseback when he realized that the route between Senj, as a major fortress on Adriatic coast, and the hinterland was nearly impassable. Legend has it that this happened when he fell from his horse near Vratnik Pass. Even though the incident is impossible to verify, the town of Josipdol to the east of the mountain pass is named after the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1775, Joseph II indeed commissioned construction of the route, exactly long, from Vincenc Struppi, a military engineer, and the road, named after the Emperor, was completed in 1779. The original route comprised very steep sections and 20% inclines were not uncommon. There was even one climb at a 30% grade. Because of this the road was modified and extended by , in order to remove such steep sections. The first reconstruction was carried out as early as late 18th century, and another one between 1833 and 1845 managed by Field Marshal Josip Filip Vukasoviƒá and Josip Kajetan Kne≈æiƒá respectively. Subsequent modifications were not as significant. The road was paved in 1950, when the last minor modifications of the route were executed. The route was distinguished by mile markers along the route, an obelisk in Karlovac marking the beginning of the road and a specially built gate in Senj marking its end. Most remarkably the original road included a stone bridge across three spans in Tounj, which was expanded during the reconstruction of 1845 and now has two levels. The upper level was destroyed during World War II, but it was rebuilt in the 1950s.

In the context of the recent African origin of modern humans, the Southern Dispersal scenario (also the coastal migration or great coastal migration hypothesis) refers to the early migration along the southern coast of Asia, from the Arabian peninsula via Persia and India to Southeast Asia and Oceania Alternative names include the \\"southern coastal route\\"Metspalu et al 2006, Human Mitochondrial DNA and the Evolution of Homo sapiens. or \\"rapid coastal settlement\\"., with later descendants of those migrations eventually colonizing the rest of Eurasia (including Europe), the remainder of Oceania, and the Americas. The coastal route theory is primarily used to describe the initial peopling of West Asia, India, Southeast Asia, New Guinea, Australia, Near Oceania, and coastal East Asia beginning between roughly 70,000 and 50,000 years ago. It is linked with the presence and dispersal of mtDNA haplogroup M and haplogroup N, as well as the specific distribution patterns of Y-DNA haplogroup F , haplogroup C and haplogroup D, in these regions.Searching for traces of the Southern Dispersal , by Dr Marta Miraz√≥n Lahr, et al. The theory proposes that early modern humans, some of the bearers of mitochondrial haplogroup L3, arrived in the Arabian peninsula about 70,000-50,000 years ago, crossing from East Africa via the Bab-el-Mandeb straits. It has been estimated that from a population of 2,000 to 5,000 individuals in Africa, only a small group, possibly as few as 150 to 1,000 people, crossed the Red Sea. The group would have travelled along the coastal route around Arabia and Persia to India relatively rapidly, within a few thousand years. From India, they would have spread to Southeast Asia (\\"Sundaland\\") and Oceania (\\"Sahul\\").

Abstraction method The abstraction method in the CPSM development is the method used to compile the concrete source code for a given platform without compromising the abstract interfaces provided. The most commonly used abstraction methods in CPSM development are: conditional compilation and directory separation of sources. The first method consists in embedding preprocessor instructions in the source code to conditionally select the source subtree compatible with a given platform. The second method takes advantage of the filesystem organization to divide the source code in different folders, one for each incompatible platform. Thus delegating the selection problem to the build system. Some distributions like MSYS and Cygwin may help build the cross-platform code in a Unix-like environment even on Microsoft Windows. Both distributions provide a decent version of GNU Make that can direct the build process in a cross-platform fashion.

The brothers worked together for most of their careers and divided the various departments of filmmaking among them to produce movies.

After the Partition of India, Fatehchand U. Ramsay (F.U. Ramsay) along with his seven sons, moved to Mumbai and set up an electronics shop at Lamington Road. Soon, lured by the glamour of Hindi cinema, he got into show business with films such as Shaheed-e-Azam Bhagat Singh (1954), Rustam Sohrab (1963) and Ek Nanhi Munni Ladki Thi (1970). The films flopped and the Ramsays were reeling under huge debts when inspiration struck. In a scene in Ek Nanhi Munni Ladki Thi, Prithviraj Kapoor wears a devil's mask to carry out a robbery and terrifies Mumtaz. The film didn't work but the ‚Äúmonster‚Äù sequence did, encouraging the Ramsays to experiment with Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche (1971). The film was advertised in a half-hour, late-night show on radio which helped it get the ‚ÄúHouseful‚Äù board up when it was released. Its success sparked a trend of shoe- string budget movies that were wrapped up in a month with a crew of 15. Films The Ramsay Brothers have made more than 30 horror films in India, which epitomize the lower depths of 1980s Bollywood sleaze and gore, but which have secured their place in Hindi cinema's hall of fame as the pioneers of horror. / They are producers, directors and editors for many famous Hindi horror movies such as Guest House (1980 film), Veerana, Purana Mandir, Purani Haveli (film), Darwaza and Bandh Darwaza, and the TV series \\"Zee Horror Show\\". Their first film Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche proved a milestone for them and for Indian horror film industry. At a time when the average Hindi film took about a year and 50 lakhs to complete, Do Gaz Zameen Ke Neeche was shot in 40 days on a budget of Rs 3.5 lakhs. All the eight Ramsey brothers boarded buses with small-time actors, a sparse film crew, their wives and parents and drove to a government guesthouse in Mahabaleshwar that cost Rs 12 a room ‚Äì they took eight rooms. They didn't spend on sets because they shot on location. They didn't spend on costumes because these were picked out of actors‚Äô wardrobes. The cameras were all borrowed. All the departments for making the film was taken care of by the eight brothers. The film ran to full houses in the first week after its release. It made Rs 45 lakhs. Their 1980s horror films are generally considered as the combination of sex and supernaturals.

Career  In 1905, after graduation from Harvard, Chrostwaite was admitted to the Pennsylvania Bar and opened a law office in York County, where he dedicated his efforts as municipal solicitor for Hanover Borough. In this capacity, Chrostwaite became fascinated with community organization, municipal law, and the history of local governments. His passion for these subjects led him to visit borough governments across Pennsylvania, where he would often converse with citizens that lived under various styles of municipal government to gain a more comprehensive perspective of the Commonwealth. His personal enrichment also extended to his foreign travels, where Chrostwaite attempted to further develop his understanding of local governmental systems and their responsiveness to the citizens they serve. His extensive experiences were instrumental in establishing the Pennsylvania State Association of Boroughs. Chrostwaite was editor of the Municipal Law Reporter. Later he served as school administrator in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania State Association of Boroughs  In the early years, the Association advocated for health regulations to confront high incidences of disease, promoted infrastructure development which led to job creation and served a vital role in helping to shape state programs that were important to citizens. Chrostwaite retired as President of PSAB in 1957 at the age of 84. To memorialize his contributions, PSAB created the Chrostwaite Institute. He is also commemorated by the Thomas F.

He was responsible for over fifty patents obtained between the years 1902 to 1930. Kingsbury is most famous for his hydrodynamic thrust bearing which uses a thin film of oil to support weights of up to 220 tons. This bearing extended the service life of many types of machinery during the early 20th century. It was primarily outfitted on Navy ships during World War I and World War II. Personal life Albert Kingsbury was born in Morris, Illinois and graduated from Cuyahoga Falls High School, OH in 1880. Kingsbury would eventually father five daughters. In addition to his interest in tribology and bearings, Kingsbury enjoyed the world of arts, history, and letters. He devoted much time to the study of foreign languages. Kingsbury died in 1943, and was buried at the Quaker Cemetery, Spring Mills, Pennsylvania. Formal education In 1884, Kingsbury attended the University of Akron to study Scientific-Latin courses. He dropped out and worked as a machine apprentice in Cuyahoga Falls. Kingsbury credited this as an important experience that led him to advance his career in engineering. Kingsbury resumed his formal education at Ohio State University, but he again dropped out to work as a machinist with the Warner and Swasey Company in Cleveland. Kingsbury received his mechanical engineering degree from Cornell University in 1887. It was at Cornell that he met Professor Robert Henry Thurston. Professor Thurston was instrumental in shaping Kingsbury's interest in bearings and tribology. Working under Professor Thurston, Kingsbury conducted tests on bearing materials for the Pennsylvania Railroad. His craftsmanship, honed by his experience in machine shops, allowed Kingsbury to fit half- bushings to the journal by scraping. His hand fitting produced the small tolerances that promoted film lubrication. These bearings, when ran showed no measurable signs of wear, and was Kingsbury's prompt to the creation of the thrust bearings which now bear his name. Teaching career University of New Hampshire Kingsbury pursued a teaching position at the University of New Hampshire. Within two years, he was a professor of Mechanical Engineering courses at the university. His new position at the university allowed him to continue pursuing his interest in lubrication. During his time at the University of New Hampshire, he created an innovative test machine to measure friction in coarse pitch, lubricated screw threads at loads of up to 14,000 psi. The usefulness of this invention received mixed reviews from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). His research also covered fluid lubricated bearings, and he published a paper entitled \\"Experiments with an Air Lubricated Bearing\\". It was at this university that he envisioned the Kingsbury thrust bearing. Worcester Polytechnic Institute Kingsbury joined the Worcester Polytechnic Institute to continue pursuing his interest in lubrication. He secured expansions for laboratory facilities and funding to continue his tests on a centrally pivoted thrust bearing with the aid of his students. Invention of the Kingsbury thrust bearing Kingsbury's research at the University of New Hampshire led him to conceive an early Kingsbury bearing that consisted of several stationary arc segments facing a thrust collar on the rotating shaft. Each segment would have a boss on the side away from the thrust collar, allowing it to tilt and form an oil wedge that would carry the thrust. Kingsbury tested this new bearing with a modified version of his earlier screw thread testing machine. The bearing was successful with pressures of up to 4,000 psi at speeds of 285 rpm. This pressure exceeded that for common collar-type bearings by a factor of 80 to 100, thus proving the promise of the Kingsbury bearing. Westinghouse career Kingsbury joined the Westinghouse Electric Company in Pittsburgh as a general engineer. He used this as an opportunity to advance the development of his thrust bearings in an industrial setting. Unfortunately, the first test of his thrust bearing was a failure. His bearing overheated during the test and was discarded. This made the company skeptical of Kingsbury's invention, but Westinghouse's skepticism did not dent Kingsbury's enthusiasm. Kingsbury would later fund his own test that proved his bearings successful. Unfortunately Westinghouse decided to stick to more conventional ball bearings for their motors. Patenting of the Kingsbury thrust bearing Kingsbury tried to file for a U.S. patent during 1907. His initial application was rejected as a British patent had been granted in 1905 to A.G.M. Michell who had a similar concept. Kingsbury was able to demonstrate that his 1898 test at the University of New Hampshire predated Michell's work, so in 1910 Kingsbury was awarded US patent No. 947242 for the tilting pad thrust bearing. Success of the Kingsbury bearing Kingsbury would eventually run his own business with the Westinghouse Machine Co. building his bearings. This allowed him to actively pursue applications for his newly patented thrust bearing. His first chance came when the Pennsylvania Water and Power Co. gave him the opportunity to demonstrate his bearing on their power generator at the Susquehanna River. His first bearing was a failure as it was immediately destroyed by Hillson wiping. Fortunately for Kingsbury, the Pennsylvania Water and Power Co. gave him a second chance. His bearing succeeded this time, and worked flawlessly for the next 25 years. When it was inspected after 25 years, there was so little evidence of wear that it was calculated that the bearing would last 1,300 to 1,700 years. The same bearing is still operating smoothly today. By World War I, the Kingsbury thrust bearing was used extensively in the navy especially to transmit thrust from propeller shafts to ships' hulls (i.e., the propeller pushes water in one direction, and the Kingsbury thrust bearing, attached to the shaft and mounted to the ship, pushes the ship in the opposite direction). In 1921, the Kingsbury thrust bearing had become so popular that Westinghouse could no longer keep up with the demand, thus prompting Kingsbury to set up his own manufacturing plant. Later years Kingsbury continued to pursue his interest in bearings and tribology later in his life. One of his greatest achievements was his analysis of the effects of side leakage of lubricants from bearings. By recognizing the analogy in the equations for lubrication and those for electrical flow in a conductive fluid and variable depth, Kingsbury was able to make complicated predictions of slider load capacity well before the advent of computers. Legacy and awards Kingsbury received many accolades for his contributions to science and engineering. He was awarded the Gold Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1931; the Elliott Cresson Medal of the Franklin Institute; and honorary doctorates from the University of New Hampshire and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The Kingsbury Hall at the University of New Hampshire also pays homage to the great inventor. Albert Kingsbury was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

It has important applications in the areas of rendezvous, targeting, guidance, and preliminary orbit determination.E. R. Lancaster & R. C. Blanchard, A Unified Form of Lambert's Theorem, Goddard Space Flight Center, 1968 Suppose a body under the influence of a central gravitational force is observed to travel from point P1 on its conic trajectory, to a point P2 in a time T. The time of flight is related to other variables by Lambert's theorem, which states: :The transfer time of a body moving between two points on a conic trajectory is a function only of the sum of the distances of the two points from the origin of the force, the linear distance between the points, and the semimajor axis of the conic.James F. Jordon, The Application of Lambert's Theorem to the Solution of Interplanetary Transfer Problems, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 1964 Stated another way, Lambert's problem is the boundary value problem for the differential equation : \\\\ddot {\\\\bar r } = -\\\\mu \\\\cdot \\\\frac {\\\\hat r } {r^2}\\\\ \\\\ of the two-body problem when the mass of one body is infinitesimal; this subset of the two- body problem is known as the Kepler orbit.

The value A \\\\ is positive or negative depending on which of the points P_1 \\\\ and P_2 \\\\ that is furthest away from the point F_1 \\\\ . The geometrical problem to solve is to find all ellipses that go through the points P_1 \\\\ and P_2 \\\\ and have a focus at the point F_1 \\\\ The points F_1 \\\\ , P_1 \\\\ and P_2 \\\\ define a hyperbola going through the point F_1 \\\\ with foci at the points P_1 \\\\ and P_2 \\\\ .

The semi-major axis of this hyperbola is A \\\\ and the eccentricity E\\\\ is \\\\frac{d}{A}\\\\ . This hyperbola is illustrated in figure 2.

The radial and tangential velocity components can then be computed with the formulas (see the Kepler orbit article) : V_r = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac {\\\\mu}{p}} \\\\cdot e \\\\cdot \\\\sin \\\\theta \\\\ : V_t = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac {\\\\mu}{p}} \\\\cdot (1 + e \\\\cdot \\\\cos \\\\theta). The transfer times from P1 to P2 for other values of y are displayed in Figure 4. Practical applications The most typical use of this algorithm to solve Lambert's problem is certainly for the design of interplanetary missions. A spacecraft traveling from the Earth to for example Mars can in first approximation be considered to follow a heliocentric elliptic Kepler orbit from the position of the Earth at the time of launch to the position of Mars at the time of arrival. By comparing the initial and the final velocity vector of this heliocentric Kepler orbit with corresponding velocity vectors for the Earth and Mars a quite good estimate of the required launch energy and of the maneuvres needed for the capture at Mars can be obtained. This approach is often used in conjunction with the patched conic approximation. This is also a method for orbit determination. If two positions of a spacecraft at different times are known with good precision (for example by GPS fix) the complete orbit can be derived with this algorithm, i.e. an interpolation and an extrapolation of these two position fixes is obtained.

His father had also served as a councillor, alderman, Mayor and Lord Mayor of the City of Adelaide.W. B. Pitcher, Bonython, Sir John Lavington (1875 - 1960), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 7, Melbourne University Press, 1979, pp 341-342. Kym was the youngest of six children; he had one half-brother (John Langdon Bonython (1905‚Äì1992)), two half-sisters (Lady Betty Wilson and Ada Heath), a brother (Charles Warren BonythonWarren Bonython, Bright Sparcs) and a sister (Katherine Verco). War pilot He attended St Peter's College, Adelaide, and upon completion entered into accountancy on the recommendation of his older half-brother John. The Second World War interrupted this: in 1940 he began training as a pilot for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). Bonython served in the (then) Netherlands East Indies and New Guinea, experiencing several \\"death defying\\" near misses. He was in hospital in Darwin (with dengue fever) during the 1942 bombing Exert from \\\\- he had just evacuated and taken cover when the ward he had been in took a direct hit.

Bonython joined the RAAF in 1940 and was posted to No. 87 (PR) Squadron in 1944. In April, 1945, he carried out the longest photographic mission ever undertaken by this squadron, to Central Java. As a flight commander he showed outstanding fearlessness, and by his keenness and devotion to flying proved an inspiration to all other pilots of the squadron.\\" Discovering jazz When he returned from service he chose not to return to accounting, deciding on a very different career path. Initially he took up dairy farming on his father's Mount Pleasant property, where he introduced artificial breeding of cattle into Australia. In the 1950s his career changed to incorporate music, the arts, and motor racing. As a child Kym Bonython developed a passion for jazz, and this influenced a number of his later pursuits. At the age of 17, in 1937, he entered the media with an ABC radio jazz show. The show continued for 38 years, finishing in 1975. His involvement in the jazz scene also extended to making and selling music; in 1952 he became a member of a jazz band as drummer ‚Äì a skill he had learned as a child ‚Äì and he opened his first record store in Bowman's Arcade on King William Street in 1954. His passion for music also led him to create his own concert promotion company, Aztec Services, in the 1950s, and as a promoter he brought to Adelaide some of the greats of jazz, including Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. Later, at the urging of his children, he expanded his range to rock and roll, bringing the likes of Chuck Berry to Adelaide, and he was one of the key people responsible for negotiating the addition of Adelaide to The Beatles Australian tour 1964. Passion for art Along with music, Kym Bonython had a passion for art, and he began his collection in 1945. In 1961 he opened his first gallery, the Bonython Art Gallery in North Adelaide, (which later became the Bonython Meadmore gallery). His first major exhibition was British Art of the 1960s, where he exhibited the first painting of Francis Bacon shown in Australia. He subsequently moved to Sydney to open the Hungry Horse Gallery in Paddington in 1966. His time with his Sydney gallery ended in 1976, and he returned to Adelaide to buy back his original gallery, operating it until 1983. From 1988 Bonython managed a Sydney gallery once more, managing the BMG Fine Art for a short time. Kym Bonython's eye for contemporary art saw his galleries promote many Australian and international artists, including Sidney Nolan, Pro Hart and William Dobell, and he is widely acknowledged to have discovered and fostered the work of Brett Whiteley. Along with the art galleries and his personal collection (much of which was destroyed when the Ash Wednesday bushfires of 1983 engulfed his Mount Lofty property, \\"Eurilla\\"\\"Eurilla\\", Mount Lofty, ca. 1890 - the residence of Sir William Milne at Mount Lofty. Later the property of Sir Lavington Bonython, and later still, of Kym Bonython. 1905 1890), Bonython authored and published a number of art books. Behind the wheel Kym Bonython gained a reputation as a daredevil partially through another of his interests: motor racing. He raced Speedcars at the Rowley Park Speedway in the Adelaide suburb of Bowden, which he also owned the lease on and successfully promoted from 1954 to 1973. Bonython had some major crashes in Speedcars but also some success, winning the South Australian Championship in 1959‚Äì60. He competed at venues such as the Sydney Showground Speedway, Claremont Speedway in Perth and the Brisbane Exhibition Ground (Ekka). At one stage he was also the national hydroplane champion. His life in motor sports led to many accidents, the most serious being in 1956 when, racing to defend his Australian hydroplane title at Snowdens Beach, his boat crashed; the injuries that resulted led to Bonython spending the next 14 months on crutches. Amongst his achievements in motor sports was his work to bring Formula 1 to Adelaide in 1985, in which he has been described as a \\"catalyst\\" for the event (along with other prominent locals including then Premier of South Australia John Bannon and former F1 driver and 1983 24 Hours of Le Mans winner Vern Schuppan). His time in motor sports earned him the title of \\"the man with 99 lives\\" and, from Max Harris regarding Rowley Park, the \\"Cecil B. De Mille of Bowden\\". In 2007, he was one of 10 inaugural inductees into the Australian Speedway Hall of Fame. Bonython was also well known around Adelaide for travelling to various meetings or appointments on his yellow MV Agusta motorcycle. Bonython had a number of \\"near misses\\" on the bike which he claimed were the result of other road users being distracted by his famous racing helmet which had been painted with naked ladies by his friend and artist Louis James. Politics Bonython was also active in public life. He served on the Adelaide City Council, as had both his father and grandfather before him, and he was the chairman of the South Australian Jubilee 150 Board. Other boards of which he was a member included the Adelaide Festival of Arts, Musica Viva Australia and the Australia Council. Bonython was also one of Australia's leading monarchists, chairing the No Republic committee and serving as one of South Australia's delegates to the 1998 Constitutional Convention. Other causes to receive his active support included euthanasia and compulsory national service. Personal life In 1979 he wrote an autobiography: Ladies' Legs and Lemonade, Kym Bonython, Adelaide: Rigby, 1979. Kym was married twice and had five children: Chris and Robyn from the first marriage, Tim, Michael and Nicole from the second. On his return from Milne Bay after the war he married Jean Adore PaineItems of interest The Advertiser (Adelaide, SA) 25 November 1942 pg.3 - The engagement is announced of Miss Jean Paine, WAAAF, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W.

He died on 19 March 2011 at his home in North Adelaide, aged 90. He died during the running of the Clipsal 500 while an F-18 flew overhead, reflecting both his love of motor sports and his time as an RAAF pilot. He was survived by his wife, Julie, his five children, 15 grandchildren and seven great- grandchildren. Bonython was given a State Funeral, held on 29 March 2011 at St Peter's Cathedral. It was attended by many of the friends he made in speedway, including former long time Rowley Park track manager Alan Marks, Australian Sidecar champions Rick Munro and Len Bowes, Speedway City promoter Wendy Turner, Gillman Speedway promoter and former sidecar racer David Parker, flagman extraordinaire Glen Dix, and 15 time World Champion Ivan Mauger who got his first start in Australia in 1960 when Bonython signed the young Christchurch native to ride at Rowley Park.Kym Bonython Laid to Rest Publications * Modern Australian Painting & Sculpture: A Survey of Australian Art from 1950 to 1960, Rigby, Adelaide, 1960. * Modern Australian Painting 1960-70, Rigby, Adelaide, 1970. * Modern Australian Painting 1970-75, Rigby, Adelaide, 1976, Kym Bonython & Elwynn Lynn * Modern Australian Painting 1975-80, Rigby, Adelaide, 1980. * Modern Australian Painting 1950-75, Rigby, Adelaide, 1980. * Ladies' Legs and Lemonade, Adelaide: Rigby, 1979.

The game was played in the afternoon on Wednesday, July 23, at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington, D.C. and resulted in a 9‚Äì3 victory for the National League. Steve Carlton was the winning pitcher while Mel Stottlemyre was the losing pitcher. The game was originally scheduled for the evening of Tuesday, July 22, but heavy rains forced its postponement to the following afternoon. The 1969 contest remains the last All-Star Game to date to be played earlier than prime time in the Eastern United States. President Richard Nixon originally planned to attend the Tuesday night game and throw out the first ball, and then depart for the splashdown of Apollo 11 in the Pacific Ocean. But with the game's postponement until Wednesday afternoon, Nixon missed the game altogether and Vice President Spiro Agnew attended instead. Game summary After scoring in the first inning on an error, the National League made it 3‚Äì0 in the second inning against AL starter Mel Stottlemyre on a two-run homer by Reds' catcher Johnny Bench. Denny McLain was scheduled as the American League starter, but was late arriving to the stadium (via his own airplane) and pitched later in the game. Five more runs came across for the NL in the third inning, Blue Moon Odom of Oakland surrendering all. Willie McCovey's two-run homer and back-to-back doubles by F√©lix Mill√°n and pitcher Steve Carlton were the key blows. McCovey added another home run in the fourth, and was voted the game's most valuable player.

The bill was sponsored by Representative Joshua W. Alexander (D) of Missouri, who was Chairman of the House Merchant Marine Committee. The act signified the birth of the modern American merchant marine. Purpose The purpose of the US Shipping Board was to develop water transportation, operate the merchant ships owned by the government, and regulate the water carriers engaged in commerce under the flag of the United States as well as to enforce the La Follette Seamen's Act regulations and national defense. The Board consisted of 5 members and was empowered to #form one or more corporations for the purchase, leasing, and operation of merchant vessels with a maximum capital of $50 million, #to acquire vessels suitable for naval auxiliaries, #to regulate commerce on the Great Lakes and the high seas, including the fixing of rates, #to cancel or modify any agreement among carriers that were found to be unfair as between carriers and exporters, or which operated to the detriment of United States commerce, and #to sanction pooling agreements among shippers which were exempted from the operations of the Sherman Act. Passage and amendment The dispersing of the $50 million was to be overseen by the Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC). Senate Democrats managed to get the bill amended prior to passage that forbade the U.S. from purchasing ships from belligerent powers, \\"tremendously emasculating\\" the act according to Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo. Despite such criticism by hardliners, the act signified the birth of the modern American merchant marine. US Shipping Board During the war, the Board was headed by Edward N. Hurley while the EFC passed to the direction of Bethlehem Steel magnate Charles Schwab. The bill also stipulated that the shipping lines owned and operated by the Shipping Board should go out of business 5 years after the end of the European War and that all the Board's property, except vessels designed primarily as naval auxiliaries, should be sold. Many of the ships commissioned during the war were never fully completed, and many of the ships that were completed were either destroyed or auctioned off in the early 1920s. As of June 18, 1984, the duties of the US Shipping Board were reduced and currently apply only to domestic offshore ocean transport.

Life in Germany Dulon was descended from a Huguenot family. After completing his time in the gymnasium, and philosophical and theological studies at the University of Halle, he was ordained in Magdeburg in 1836. He accepted pastorates at Flossau, near Osterberg. Even at this time, he put himself in opposition to Church authorities, but in so mild a way that they could be lenient. In 1843, Dulon left the Prussian state Evangelical Church to become pastor for a German Reformed congregation in Magdeburg. His work as an agitator dates from this time. He worked together with the so-called Friends of the Light and the \\"Free Congregations,\\" though without adopting their dogmas. What attracted him to them was their common fight against the validity of the articles of faith in the Reformed Church and the Catholicizing tendencies in the uniting Evangelical Church. He was reprimanded, but this only seemed to encourage him. In 1848, a vote apparently excluded him from Bremen's Church of Our Lady (Liebfrauenkirche), where he had been preaching, but a majority of the congregation overturned the decision and installed him as pastor; and the Senate of Bremen, the city-state government and highest authority in the Bremen state church, intimidated by the upheavals of the time, dispensed with many of the initiation requirements only insisting on adherence to \\"the word of God.\\" In undertaking his examination, Dulon explained that the Bible and God's word were for him two very different things. In November 1849 he protected the leftist Arnold Ruge, granting him church asylum from an impending arrest, and organised a further hiding place at Hermann Allmers's, before finding refuge in Brighton. Followers streamed to him from all quarters and levels of society, and he moved to the front of the democratic movement. Democracy and revolution were to him the true Christianity. His sermons were characterized by their socialist content. He was strenuously opposed to the illiberal measures of the Friedrich Eichhorn, Prussian minister of cult and education. In 1850 he established the Bremen Tages-Chronik (Daily Chronicle), a social-democratic sheet - with Ruge contributing from abroad -, and Der Wecker. Ein Sonntagsblatt zur Bef√∂rderung des religi√∂sen Lebens (The Alarmist. A Sunday paper for promoting the religious life), a religious weekly. His string of victories became his fate. In 1851, his newspaper was forbidden in Prussia. The senate drew courage from the changing tenor of the times. In 1852, an intervention in Bremen was resolved upon by the German Confederation, and 10,000 troops stood on the outskirts of town. Dulon's days were numbered. Even in 1851, members of the Friends of the Light had complained to the senate, accusing him of denying essential articles of faith, mocking the gospel and open hostility to Christianity. The senate had referred the charges to theologians (Daniel Schenkel, Friedrich Wilhelm Carl Umbreit, and others) in Heidelberg who had confirmed the senate (though some thought deposing pastors was outside its jurisdiction) and declared Dulon unworthy of spiritual office in the Bremen Reformed state Church. Dulon was suspended, then dismissed and sentenced to six months in jail. He fled to Heligoland, which belonged to the United Kingdom at that time. Life in the United States In 1853 he emigrated with his numerous family to the United States,Carl Wittke, Refugees of Revolution: The German Forty-Eighters in America, Philadelphia: Univ. of Penn. Press, 1952, p. 129. where he supported himself by lecturing and teaching young people. He became the pastor of an independent congregation in New York City, and at the same time issued a series of ‚ÄúSabbath Leaves‚Äù in the interests of free religion. He started the first German-American school in the United States. In 1855, he bought the Feldner School in New York City, and later, from 1866 until his death, directed the Realschule in Rochester, New York. Future Civil War general Franz Sigel, a Badensian, taught in Dr. Dulon's New York schools, and subsequently married one of his daughters. At the end of his life, Dulon published a book, The German School in America.Wittke, p. 302. In the history of the Evangelical Church, there has hardly been another, except possibly Thomas M√ºnzer, who has put religion in the service of revolutionary socialism so much as Rudolf Dulon. Notes  References  * * External links *Carl Schurz, In Chapter XI of Volume One, Schurz describes a ruse concocted by Dulon. To divert the Prussian police pursuing Gottfried Kinkel, who had escaped from prison in Spandau with the aid of Schurz, Dulon described in a newspaper article how Kinkel had sailed from Bremen to London. In reality, Schurz and Kinkel were resting in Mecklenburg and still preparing to sail to England.

IELT varies not only from man to man, but from one time to the next for the same man and tends to decrease with age. Some medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) affect IELT. IELT is one factor used to diagnose and treat conditions such as premature ejaculation. IELT may be relevant in perceptions of sexual performance and actual satisfaction, which may also be dependent on many other factors. Studies Researchers have made conflicting discoveries about IELT. In a multinational study, the authors studied 491 men in the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, UK, and US. The men were in stable heterosexual relationships. Over a four-week period, couples recorded IELT data using a stopwatch and noted condom use. Median IELT was independent of condom use. Median IELT decreased with age (18‚Äì30: 6.5 minutes, 31‚Äì50: 5.4 minutes, above 51: 4.3 minutes). Median IELT for all participants was 5.4 minutes. Median IELT varied significantly by individual with 14% of men under 3:20 and 26% of men over 10:00. Potential problems include total sample size, small sample size per country, too few observations for each participant, and psychological effects of using a stopwatch. In 1991, scholars from the Kinsey Institute stated, \\"The truth is that the time between penetration and ejaculation varies not only from man to man, but from one time to the next for the same man.\\" They added that the appropriate length for sexual intercourse is the length of time it takes for both partners to be mutually satisfied, emphasizing that Kinsey \\"found that 75 percent of men ejaculated within two minutes of penetration at least half of the time.\\" In their book Human Sexual Response, Masters and Johnson published a variety of findings on sexual response and satisfaction based on direct observation and medical exams. Sexual satisfaction is independent of how long intercourse lasts. A man's response time varies with a woman's menstrual cycle; shorter IELTs occur nearest to ovulation.(Tullberg, 1999) Both partners' sexual experience also affects latency time. A 2008 survey of Canadian and American sex therapists stated that the average time for heterosexual intercourse (coitus) was 7 minutes and that 1 to 2 minutes was too short, 3 to 7 minutes was adequate and 7 to 13 minutes desirable, while 13 to 30 minutes was too long. Effect of substances Numerous chemical substances influence the IELT. Substances such as alcohol and opioids (e.g. heroin, morphine, oxycodone) depress the central nervous system, prolonging the IELT, while selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. dapoxetine) delay ejaculation by blocking a physiological process connected to ejaculatory inevitability, \\"the male point of no return\\". For that reason, SSRIs can be prescribed to treat premature ejaculation.

Maryvale Estate to the north east of Warwick was purchased by the government and subdivided into farms. A branch line to service the region was approved in 1908. Opened on 30 September 1911, the line branched from the Southern main line at Killarney Junction (now named Mill Hill) and stretched about 30 kilometres to Maryvale via Womina, Sladevale, Campbell‚Äôs Plains, Freestone, Clintonvale and Gladfield. The line was intended to be part of a via recta (Latin, \\"straight route\\") from Brisbane to Sydney. Prior to the completion of the New South Wales Government Railways North Coast Line in 1932, the only rail link from Brisbane to Sydney was via the break-of- gauge at Wallangarra on the state border, where the two states' railway systems met. The route from Brisbane to Wallangarra went west from Brisbane to Toowoomba then south to Wallangarra. The via recta was a putative short-cut south-west from Ipswich to Warwick, which would have shortened the distance from Brisbane to Sydney by between 92 km and 95 km. The via recta would have consisted of the Maryvale branch from Warwick, the Mount Edwards branch from Ipswich, through Spicers Gap (just south of Cunninghams Gap) through the Great Dividing Range. The Warwick Argus reported that the citizens of Toowoomba were unhappy at the prospect of the via recta being built, as interstate traffic would bypass their town. Trial surveys for the via recta line began as early as 1880, and the first sod on the Maryvale line was turned on 18 March 1910 by Premier of Queensland William Kidston. However, once the standard gauge line from NSW was extended north to South Brisbane in 1930, the rationale for the via recta disappeared and the project was abandoned. A daily mixed train began on the line and was later reduced to a thrice-weekly service. A rail motor service began in 1930 and linked with the Sydney Mail at Warwick. A 1932 timetable showed five rail motors and one mixed train per week running in each direction on the Maryvale line, with extra goods services during the wheat season. The line closed on 1 November 1960 after the Cunningham Highway was upgraded through Cunninghams Gap due to the increasing popularity of road transport.

This act in particular aided the Cape Fear River in North Carolina and the Mississippi River in Arkansas. Most importantly, however, it authorized the scraping of a shipping channel in the St. Clair River on the border of Michigan and Ontario, Canada, as well as including a provision to build a speed bump protruding several feet above the river bottom to slow the river's overall outflow. Since the St. Clair River formed the major northern part of the Great Lakes Waterway with Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River in the south, with its mouth forming the largest river delta in North America, the project was intended to be of great importance, both in terms of prestige and in improving overall trade with Canada. The Welland Canal between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, which allowed shipping traffic to bypass Niagara Falls, had been under construction since 1913, and the St. Clair project was seen as complementary to better connect Lake Erie with Lake Huron.

The service was discontinued by Time Inc. on April 30, 2012. Service details The website allowed users to order magazines of their choice; users could change which magazines they receive at any time, unlike conventional subscriptions. The membership service provided members the ability to manage their household's magazines from one online account. However, people who subscribed to magazines using Maghound did not receive premium content which publishers reserve for full subscribers, because sales to Maghound customers were reported as single-copy sales. Publishers received the addresses of Maghound users who buy their magazines, but they were not able to advertise to these customers. Membership pricing was tiered - three magazines for $4.95 a month, five titles for $7.95, seven titles for $9.95, and $1.00 additional per title for eight titles or more. Approximately 10 percent of magazine titles available through this service included a small premium fee. Membership was available in the U.S. only. On February 2, 2012, Time Inc. announced that Maghound will cease operations on April 30, 2012.

Cullen, circa 1913. Edgar Montgomery Cullen (1843 ‚Äì 1922) was an American lawyer, judge, and politician from the state of New York. Cullen is best remembered as the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals from 1904 to 1913. Biography Early years Edgar Montgomery Cullen was born December 4, 1843 in Brooklyn, Kings County, New York, the second son of Dr. Henry J. Cullen (1805‚Äì1874) and Elizabeth McCue. He attended the Kinderhook Academy and graduated from Columbia College in 1860.\\"Edgar M. Cullen, Jurist, Dies at 78,\\" New York Times, May 24, 1922. After leaving Columbia, Cullen enrolled at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, until his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the American Civil War. In 1861, he was commissioned a lieutenant in the First United States Infantry of the regular army, and in 1862 became colonel of the 96th New York Volunteer Infantry at the age of just 19. After his discharge from the Union Army, he resumed at first his engineering studies, but soon changed to the study of law, and was admitted to the bar in 1867. Legal career Cullen became active in Democratic Party politics and served from 1872 to 1875 as an Assistant District Attorney of Kings County. In 1876 he served as a top advisor on the staff of Governor Samuel J. Tilden. Cullen was elected as a justice of the New York Supreme Court in 1880. He was re-elected to a second 14-year term in 1894. In 1900, Culllen was one of the first three justices appointed under the amendment of 1899 to the Court of Appeals. After the resignation of Alton B. Parker to run for President of the United States in September 1904, Cullen was appointed by Governor Benjamin Barker Odell, Jr. as Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals. In November 1904, he was elected to a full 14-year term as Chief Judge, nominated as a fusion candidate by Republicans and Democrats. In 1913, he presided at the impeachment trial of Governor William Sulzer, and voted against conviction. Cullen retired from the bench at the end of 1913 when he reached the constitutional age limit of 70 years. Afterwards he resumed the practice of law when he joined the law firm Cullen & Dykman based out of 144 Montague Street, Brooklyn. Cullen was feted at the time of his retirement with a banquet in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, hosted by the Brooklyn Bar Association and attended by 450 of the most prominent figures in New York political and legal circles, including former Governor and sitting Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes.\\"High Honors Paid to Judge Cullen by Bench and Bar,\\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle, vol. 74, no. 3 (Jan. 4, 1914), pp. 1, 5. In his speech to the gathering, Cullen expressed pride in the legal profession and offered criticism of President Woodrow Wilson's call for judicial appeal to be \\"short, sharp, and decisive\\" so that government could more expeditiously function. Cullen responded: Death and legacy Edgar M. Cullen died on May 23, 1922 at his home at 144 Willow Street in Brooklyn following a serious \\"stroke of apoplexy,\\" from which he did not recover. He was 78 years old at the time of his death. Cullen's body was buried at the Green-Wood Cemetery in his native Brooklyn.

Formerly it was assigned to the 11th-century (Tregelles, Scrivener). It has marginalia, it was adapted for liturgical use.  Description  The codex contains a text of the four Gospels on 232 parchment leaves () with some lacunae (Matthew 1:1-2:2; 4:19-5:25; John 14:22-16:27). The text is written in one column per page, 22 lines per page (), in black ink, the initial letters in gold ink. The text is divided according to the (chapters), whose numbers are given at the margin, with their (titles of chapters) at the top of the pages. There is also another division according to the Ammonian Sections (in Matthew 355, in Mark 233), whose numbers are given at the margin, with references to the Eusebian Canons (partially). The references to the Eusebian Canons are incomplete. It contains tables of the (tables of contents) before each Gospel and subscriptions at the end of each Gospel.

Its first series of six 30-minute episodes premiered on 17 November 2008. After a planned second series was vetoed by BBC Three, Gatiss hinted at plans for a big-screen version, however this failed to materialise. Story Intended to be a prototype super soldier who will eventually replace Britain's volunteer Army, his creator, the brilliant scientist Dr Victor Blenkinsop discovers, to both his horror and distaste, that his new super weapon is not quite the awe-inspiring creation he expected. In fact, the clone is more likely to hug someone than shoot them. This modern-day Dr Frankenstein and his monster go on the run hoping to find the neurological trigger that will fix the clone and unlock his superhuman abilities. Unfortunately, they must also avoid Colonel Black and his crack team of security agents, whose mission is to find them and kill them. Episodes Series one (2008) { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:98%;\\" ! width=\\"20\\"# !! Title !! width=\\"240\\"Original airdate } Regular cast *Mark Gatiss - Colonel Black: The head of MI7: Britain's most Secret of Services. The Colonel is a blood thirsty nemesis who will stop at nothing to kill Victor and the clone. He is a man with limitless power and no conscience. He kills people simply because they can't find Blenkinsop or the clone. He shows no remorse after a false lead results in the death of two innocent people, a later mistake resulting in the death of an operative who had just provided him with vital information regarding the clone's whereabouts. *Fiona Glascott - Rose Bourne: The Irish owner and bartender of The Peanut, a small pub in the even smaller village of Bletherford. Rose is a beautiful but shy young redhead of 26 who has several extraordinary abilities: a photographic memory and savant level maths skills. She likens Victor's selfish sociopathical behaviour to her father. Upon meeting her, Victor realizes she could be the key to unlocking the clone's dormant abilities, resolving to acquire a little piece of her brain. *Oliver Maltman - Ian, Victor's assistant: Victor's loyal lab assistant. A modern Igor, Ian is in awe of his boss and is willing to do anything it takes to help him, including being a human guinea pig or being beaten by the Secret Intelligence Services. Like Victor, Ian lacks a social life, although it's due to his shyness rather than his arrogance; he was apparently to be married, but his fianc√© left him at the altar. *Stuart McLoughlin - Clone, AKA Albert: The first human clone and appears to be in his mid-twenties. Intended as a prototype super weapon, the clone emerges from his birthing tube more likely to hug someone than shoot them. The clone is an innocent to whom everything is new, from chocolate, to laughing and dancing. He is fascinated by everything, but is naive of basic social interaction; while he has memory engrams to allow him to function as a soldier, he can't seem to access them, although Ian speculates that they may activate eventually. *Jonathan Pryce - Dr. Victor Blenkinsop: A modern Dr. Frankenstein and the creator of the first human clone. A man who has mortgaged his entire life in the pursuit of a single goal: to take his place amongst the great names of science. Divorced three times, Victor is willing to sacrifice everything to achieve the glory he hungers for, something he can only do by fixing the clone and making him the super soldier he was designed to be.

He fought on the side of the North during the American Civil War, reaching the rank of Major. He is remembered today for several innovations in the opening, particularly the Hanham Variation of Philidor's Defense (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 Nd7). Military service, appearance Although a Mississippian, Hanham fought for the Union Army during the Civil War. He saw action at Fort Pickens and Baton Rouge, and was promoted to the rank of Major. After the war, he moved to Manhattan.James Moore Hanham A writer in the New York Times, describing the players in the Sixth American Chess Congress (1889), portrayed him as follows:Chess Note 5710 (quoting \\"The Chessboard Kings: Ways and Looks of 20 Great Players\\", New York Times, June 16, 1889, p. 8). > Major Hanham is a little, nervous man, who hates to sit still. He won his > title during the war of the rebellion. He was one of the dudes of the > tournament, and was always dressed in the latest style, with a carefully > polished silk hat and neatly trimmed beard. Chess career Hanham played in many American and international chess tournaments between 1884 and 1899.Gino Di Felice, Chess Results, 1747-1900, McFarland & Company, 2004, pp. 93, 98‚Äì99, 102‚Äì03, 110, 117, 128, 130‚Äì31, 137, 142‚Äì44, 152, 157, 163, 169, 174, 187, 196. . At American tournaments, he finished second to Eugene Delmar in the 8th and 9th championships of the Manhattan Chess Club, both held in 1885, and at an 1886 New York Chess Club tournament.Di Felice, pp. 98, 102. At Cincinnati 1888, the first United States Chess Association tournament, he tied for 2nd‚Äì3rd with 5.5/10, far behind winner Jackson Showalter.Di Felice, p. 110. He finished 3rd with 3/6 at Lexington 1891, the fourth United States Chess Association tournament, behind Showalter and William Pollock, who tied for first at 5/6.Di Felice, p. 128. He won two tournaments at Skaneateles, New York in 1891.Di Felice, p. 130. According to Chessmetrics, Hanham's best-ever performance was at Grove Spring 1898, where he scored 4.5/7 for the New York State team against the Pennsylvania team.Chessmetrics Player Profile: J. Moore HanhamDi Felice, p. 187. At international tournaments, Hanham performed respectably but not spectacularly, usually finishing in the bottom half. At London and Nottingham, both in 1886, he finished 12th out of 13 with a 3.5/12 score, and 8th out of 10 with a 2/9 score, respectively.Di Felice, p. 99. At the Sixth American Chess Congress at New York 1889, a double round robin that was one of the longest tournaments in history, Hanham scored 14/38, finishing 16th out of 20 players; Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first with 29 points, edging out Isidor Gunsberg (28.5).Di Felice, p. 117. At New York 1894, Hanham tied for 7th‚Äì9th with a 4/10 score; recently dethroned World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz won with 8.5/10.Di Felice, p. 152. One of Hanham's best results was at New York 1893, where he scored 7.5/13 (finishing 6th of 14 players), beat the young Harry Nelson Pillsbury, and finished half a point ahead of him. Emanuel Lasker, who would become World Champion the following year, won with a perfect score.Di Felice, p. 142. By Arpad Elo's calculation, Hanham's strength during his five-year peak was equivalent to an Elo rating of 2360.Arpad E. Elo, The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present, Arco Publishing, 1978, p. 192. . At the time of his death in 1923, Hanham was the oldest player of master rank in the United States. Opening innovations Hanham's name is best remembered today for the Hanham Variation of Philidor's Defense (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 Nd7).David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld, The Oxford Companion to Chess, Oxford University Press, 2nd ed. 1992, pp. 167, 476. . David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld note in The Oxford Companion to Chess that this line, which became a favorite of the great player and theoretician Aron Nimzowitsch, allows Black to maintain a defensive center and has become one of the main lines of Philidor's Defense.Hooper and Whyld, p. 167. Larry Kaufman writes that it is a \\"strategically rich variation\\" but is out of favor today because 4.Bc4! is awkward for Black, when 4...Ngf6? loses to 5.Ng5, 4...Be7? loses a pawn to 5.dxe5 Nxe5 (5...dxe5? 6.Qd5! wins) 6.Nxe5 dxe5 7.Qh5!, and 4...c6 (best) allows 5.0-0 Be7 6.dxe5 dxe5 (6...Nxe5? 7.Nxe5 dxe5 8.Qh5 wins a pawn) 6.Ng5! Bxg5 7.Qh5 Qe7 8.Qxg5, when White's bishop pair gives him a substantial advantage.Larry Kaufman, The Chess Advantage in Black and White, Random House Puzzles & Games, 2004, pp. 66, 69. . To avoid this line, today Black often tries to reach the Hanham by different move orders, such as 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 Nf6 4.Nc3 Nbd7, 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 e5 4.Nf3 Nbd7, or 1.e4 d6 2.d4 Nf6 3.Nc3 Nbd7 4.Nf3 e5.Kaufman, p. 65. Hooper and Whyld also credit Hanham with introducing a number of other opening lines, including the Grand Prix Attack against the Sicilian Defense (1.e4 c5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4), the Indian Opening (1.e4 e5 2.d3), and the Hanham Variation of the French Defense (1.e4 e6 2.d3), often referred to today as the King's Indian Attack.Hooper and Whyld, pp. 167, 468, 471, 478. Notable game In this game from the Sixth American Chess Congress (at New York in 1889), Hanham (playing Black) uses his eponymous variation to defeat Joseph Henry Blackburne, one of the world's leading players:Blackburne-Hanham, Sixth American Chess Congress, New York 1889 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 d6 3.Bc4 Be7 4.Nc3 c6 5.d4 Nd7 6.O-O Ngf6 7.Qe2 O-O 8.Be3 Qc7 reaching the typical setup of the Hanham Variation of Philidor's Defense. 9.Bb3 h6 10.Nh4 Nb6 11.Ng6 Re8 12.dxe5 dxe5 13.h3 Bd6 14.Rad1 Be6 15.Bxe6 Rxe6 16.Nh4 Nbd7 17.Nf5 Bf8 18.g4 Nh7 19.h4 Rg6 20.Kh1 Nc5 21.Rg1 Ne6 22.Rg3 Rd8 23.Rdg1 Nd4 24.Qf1 Nxc2 25.Bc1 Nd4 26.h5 Rf6 27.f4 exf4 28.Bxf4 Qa5 29.Qc1 Re6 30.Bd2 Qe5 31.Bf4 Qa5 32.Be3 Nb5 33.Bd2 Nxc3 34.Bxc3 Qa4 35.Re1 Rxe4 36.b3 Rxe1+ 37.Qxe1 Qxa2 38.g5 hxg5 39.h6 Qc2 40.Nd4 Qg6 41.Qe5 Qxh6+ 42.Kg2 Qd6 43.Qe2 Qd5+ 44.Kh3 Qh1+ 45.Kg4 Nf6+ 46.Kxg5 Rd5+ 47.Kf4 Bd6+ 0-1  References  External links * Category:American chess players Category:1840 births Category:1923 deaths Category:Chess theoreticians ","title":"James Hanham"},{"id":"20294171","text":"Khamlung is a village development committee in the Himalayas of Taplejung District in the Mechi Zone of north-eastern Nepal.

The technology was created by a company of the same name headquartered in San Mateo, California around 2005. Greenplum was acquired by EMC Corporation in July 2010. Starting in 2012, its database management system software became known as the Pivotal Greenplum Database sold through Pivotal Software. Pivotal open sourced the core engine and continued its development by the Greenplum Database open source community and Pivotal. Starting in 2020 Pivotal was acquired by VMware and VMware continued to sponsor the Greenplum Database open source community as well as commercialize the technology under the brand name VMware Tanzu Greenplum.  Company  Greenplum, the company, was founded in September 2003 by Scott Yara and Luke Lonergan. It was a merger of two smaller companies: Metapa (founded in August 2000 near Los Angeles) and Didera in Fairfax, Virginia. Investors included SoundView Ventures, Hudson Ventures and Royal Wulff Ventures. A total of in funding was announced at the merger. Greenplum, based in San Mateo, California, released its database management system software based on PostgreSQL in April 2005 calling it Bizgres. Rounds of venture capital of about each were invested in March 2006 and February 2007. In July 2006 a partnership with Sun Microsystems was announced. Sun, which had also acquired MySQL AB, participated in a round of investment in January 2009, led by Meritech Capital Partners. The Bizgres project included a few other members, and was supported through about 2008, when the product was just called \\"Greenplum\\" as well. The Sun Fire X4500 was a reference architecture and used by the majority of customers until a transition was made to Linux around that time. Greenplum was acquired by EMC Corporation in July 2010, becoming the foundation of EMC's big data software division. Although EMC did not disclose the value, it was estimated at . Greenplum's products at the time of acquisition were the Greenplum Database, Chorus (a management tool), and Data Science Labs. Greenplum had customers in vertical markets including eBay. It became part of Pivotal Software in 2012. A variant using Apache Hadoop to store data in the Hadoop file system called Hawq was announced in 2013. In 2015 the GreenplumDB and Hawq open source software projects were announced. Technology Pivotal's Greenplum database product uses massively parallel processing (MPP) techniques. Each computer cluster consists of a master node, standby master node, and segment nodes. All of the data resides on the segment nodes and the catalog information is stored in the master nodes. Segment nodes run one or more segments, which are modified PostgreSQL database instances and are assigned a content identifier. For each table the data is divided among the segment nodes based on the distribution column keys specified by the user in the data definition language. For each segment content identifier there is both a primary segment and mirror segment which are not running on the same physical host. When a query enters the master node, it is parsed, planned and dispatched to all of the segments to execute the query plan and either return the requested data or insert the result of the query into a database table. The Structured Query Language, version SQL:2003, is used to present queries to the system. Transaction semantics comply with constraints known as ACID. Competitors include other MPP database management systems provided by major vendors such as Teradata, Amazon Redshift, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba AnalyticDB and, in the past, IBM Netezza.} Additional competition comes from other smaller competitors, column-oriented databases such as HP Vertica, Exasol and data warehousing vendors with, non MPP architecture, such as Oracle Exadata, IBM DB2 and SAP HANA. Greenplum Version 5 In September 2017, Greenplum Database Version 5 was released.

He served a 6-year term as the director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and was appointed to be a special coordinator to respond to the health effects of the September 11 attacks. In this role, Howard advocated for rescue workers, introducing a program to provide screening, medical exams, and treatment for them. In 2009, Howard was again appointed as director of NIOSH and as World Trade Center Programs coordinator for HHS. In 2011, Howard became the Administrator of the World Trade Center Health Program. In 2016, he became the first person to be appointed to a third 6-year term as NIOSH director.

To this he added a Master of Public Health from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1982. In 1986, Dr. Howard earned a Juris Doctor from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and a Master of Laws in Administrative Law and Economic Regulation from The George Washington University in 1987. He also received a Master of Business Administration in Healthcare Management, from George Washington University, in 2016. In addition, Dr. Howard is a board-certified occupational physician and has written numerous papers on occupational health law and policy. Physician and professor Dr. Howard began his career in occupational health in 1979 as an internist at the UCLA School of Medicine pulmonary fellowship program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. His clinical work involved asbestos-exposed shipyard workers, and he published research findings related to workplace exposure and occupational lung disease. He served as a medical director and chief clinician at the Philip Mandelker AIDS Prevention Clinic. He also worked as an assistant professor of environmental and occupational medicine at the University of California, Irvine.

There he administered a staff of nearly 1,000 and all the state's occupational and public safety programs. Through his administration of the division, Howard bolstered his reputation in the field as a passionate and able leader. He received praise for successfully implementing a controversial statewide ergonomic standard. He served in this capacity for more than a decade. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Appointment Linda Rosenstock resigned in November 2000 as the director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The position was not filled until July 15, 2002, when Tommy Thompson, Health and Human Services Secretary placed John Howard in the post. The gap between Rosenstock and Howard was the longest between directors in the agency's 31-year history. The appointment was immediately praised by several organizations including the American Industrial Hygiene Association and AFL- CIO. A shift in focus Under Dr. Howard, NIOSH shifted its research efforts to focus on emerging technologies. Howard sought practical applications for the new research. This included an initiative called \\"research-to-practice\\" (r2p) to ensure that NIOSH's findings would turn into practices and products that would ultimately benefit workers. He directed research on mining, nanotechnology, job stress, and ergonomics. Howard summarized the adjustments the Institute needed to make: Howard expanded the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) instituted by his predecessor, Dr. Rosenstock, using it as a vehicle to work toward the Institute's updated aims. World Trade Center responders John Howard was appointed by President George W. Bush to be a special coordinator to handle the medical issues afflicting 9/11 rescue workers, specifically those at the World Trade Center site. Howard introduced the World Trade Center (WTC) Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program, which offered medical help and screening to emergency workers. With the enactment of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, Howard in 2011 became Administrator of the World Trade Center Health Program. Approach As a public health administrator, Howard was admired for his ability to collaborate effectively, even with adversarial parties. He was noted for the tone of \\"openness and cooperation\\" he set and for listening to and seeking input from all available stakeholders. Removal from NIOSH As Dr. Howard's 6-year term approached its close, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Julie Gerberding met with him to inform him that he would not be reappointed. His term ended on July 14, 2008, in a \\"controversial decision that brought criticism from safety and health stakeholders\\". He completed his term and began serving as a temporary senior advisor to the CDC director. NIOSH associate director Christine Branche, Ph.D., served as acting director in Dr. Howard's place. Reappointment at NIOSH On September 3, 2009, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced Howard's reappointment as director of NIOSH and World Trade Center Programs coordinator for HHS.

The City Council had planned demolishing its Bayfront Center arena and theater complex to USF and renting the land to USF, which would have used the land to build a conference center. They had second thoughts when Heller resigned. A rental agreement with an outside agency such as USF would have required a referendum. Other options included renovation and finding some other use for the land after demolition.City Council shelves USF, Bayfront Center deal His successor was Karen White, former dean of fine arts at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and a concert violinist, originally from Joplin, Missouri.

Campaign and election in 2006 Though party officials usually remain neutral in primaries, Heller was endorsed over Liz McCallum by several Pinellas Democrats in the contest to decide who would run to succeed Frank Farkas. These included County Commissioner Calvin Harris, State Representatives Charlie Justice and Frank Peterman, Jr. as well as St. Petersburg City Council members James Bennett, Rick Kriseman, and Rene Flowers, and School Board member Linda Lerner. County Commissioner Ken Welch remained neutral as he sat on the county canvassing board.\\"Heller gets party backing.\\" St. Petersburg Times. Online. June 15, 2006. Online. November 19, 2008. McCallum had narrowly lost to Farkas in the 2004 election, by less than 3,000 votes. Despite McCallum's strong showing in 2004, Heller was encouraged to run by colleague Betty Castor, a former president of USF and former Florida Secretary of Education. He came into the race at a time when McCallum had been running about a year. He had remained active in the community after stepping down as head of the St. Petersburg campus, with membership on the boards of directors of Bayfront Medical Center, the Community Foundation of Tampa Bay, Great Explorations museum, Florida International Museum and Pinellas Association of Retarded Children. He cited his education experience and ties to the community as important qualities. LaPeter, Leonora. \\"Crowded field seeks seat held by Farkas.\\" North Pinellas Times. page 12. St.Petersburg Times. Online. November 19, 2008. His community connections allowed Heller to quickly overcome his late start in fundraising, and swamp McCallum's campaign efforts. While she was taking a traditional door-to-door approach, he was able to raise money by making phone calls to acquaintances he had made over the previous 14 years.LaPeter, Leonora. \\"Late entrant piles up cash but straggles in face time.\\" St. Petersburg Times. page 3B. July 17, 2006. Online. November 19, 2008. The St. Petersburg Times endorsed Heller, citing his ability to solve problems through consensus building and his work to make USF St. Petersburg independent. It also praised his success at promoting a successful referendum to improve taxpayer funding of teacher's pay, and his leadership in saving Sunken Gardens.\\"Times recommends in the state house primaries.\\" Perspective, page 2. St. Petersburg Times. August 20, 2006. Online. November 19, 2008. A PAC, Pinellas Democrats PAC, endorsed a slate of candidates and ran an ad attacking Heller. In return, a graphic designer who had done work for the Heller campaign accused the PAC of violating contribution laws based on a $5000 contribution it had received, and lashed out against the wrongness of Democrats attacking fellow democrats. The PAC representatives countered that the $500 limit per individual contributor does not apply to PAC's.

St. Petersburg Times. September 6, 2008. Online. November 19, 2008. Similar in some ways, Heller and Cappelli differed in personality and their views on social issues. Cappelli was seen as taking an authoritarian approach, while Heller was more inclined to collaborate with others. Heller favored prosecuting crimes based on sexual orientation as hate crimes and supported same sex-unions. He said he would ban selling semi-automatic weapons, and advocated including contraceptive and safe sex information in sex education classes. Heller supported embryonic stem cell research and categorized himself as pro-choice. A local political analyst, Darryl Paulson, described their differences on social issues as irrelevant, with property insurance as the most important issue for voters. Heller said he would address cherry picking by auto and life insurance companies. Cappelli favored encouraging insurance companies to return to the Florida market by implementing a state catastrophe fund. Capelli was seen as appealing to the Republican base and received large contributions from individuals and from the Florida Republican Party, Heller's support was seen as going beyond the Democratic Party because of his long term civic activity and because he was seen as someone able to work across party lines.LaPeter, Leonora. \\"Candidates split on social issues.\\" St. Petersburg Times. 1B. September 30, 2006. Online. November 19, 2008. Heller again faced an attack campaign when Capielli approved a flier paid for by the Florida Republican party that described Heller as a \\"nutty professor.\\" The ad misrepresented Heller's support of the teacher's pay referendum, which was overwhelmingly supported by the voters, as a pro tax increase stance.Steinle, Diane. \\"Political ads: the nutty, naked truth.\\" Neighborhood Times. page 2. St. Petersburg Times. November 1, 2006. Online. November 19, 2008. Heller again received the St. Petersburg Times endorsement. While praising him for an \\"impressive\\" resume, they described Capiella as having \\"regressive views on gay rights, sex education, gun control and . . . school funding,\\" based on his responses to a questionnaire from the Christian Coalition. Once again, Heller's years with USF and his involvement with the community, and his ability to work with others were cited as essential qualities. Added to this was the position that his progressivism more closely reflected the interests and views of voters in District 52.\\"For a better Florida House.\\" page 16 A. The St. Petersburg Times. October 21, 2006. Online. November 19, 2008. Despite the attack campaign and a disadvantage in campaign contributions, Heller's popularity won him the election handily.

First term in the Florida Legislature In his freshman term, he was a member of the Agribusiness, Utilities and Telecommunications, and Post Secondary Education Committees as well as a member of the Schools and Learning Council. He was ranking Democrat on the Post Secondary Education Committee. He sponsored a number of bills. In June 2006, a Pinellas Park man had claimed to have been thrown out of a bar for not drinking, despite his assertions that he was acting as the designated driver for his group. Sen. Mike Fasano, who claims to be a non drinker, took umbrage with this and introduced in the Senate a bill to illegalize requiring bar patrons to drink.

There was an increase in the number of homeless people attacked by bored teenagers in Florida in 2006. In response, the Legislature acted to stiffen prison sentences for those who attack the homeless. Heller was one of four House sponsors of the bill.

Long and Darryl Rouson voted to support the use of school vouchers, which Florida Democrats have historically been opposed to, citing separation issues. Heller had originally been opposed, but says he was persuaded that it was an issue of quality education after meeting with the parents who were using vouchers to send their children to a private school.Matus, Ron. Voucher 'army' grows. St. Petersburg Times. May 20, 2008. Online. November 15, 2008.

They cited his ability to work across party lines and experience as an educator and former administrator with USF. They credited him with legislation that reduced the influence of the FCAT, working to ensure that autistic children would be able to receive health care coverage, and with the designated driver law. They believed he would be able to help prioritize educational programs in an era of reduced expenditures and increasing budgetary constraints.

It was composed in 1906 and has been paired with The Unanswered Question as part of \\"Two Contemplations\\" and with Hallowe'en and The Pond in \\"Three Outdoor Scenes\\". Composition The piece was first titled A Contemplation of Nothing Serious or Central Park in the Dark in \\"The Good Old Summer Time\\" (in comparison to A Contemplation of a Serious Matter or The Unanswered Perennial Question). Ives wrote detailed notes concerning the purpose and context of Central Park in the Dark: This piece was composed in 1906. The piece is scored for piccolo, flute, oboe, E (B) clarinet, bassoon, trumpet, trombone, percussion, two pianos and strings. Ives specifically suggests the two pianos be a player-piano and a grand piano. The orchestral groups are to be separated spatially from each other. Ives described the role of the instruments in a programmatic description of the piece: Characteristics Central Park in the Dark displays several characteristics that are typical of Ives's work. Ives layers orchestral textures on top of each other to create a polytonal atmosphere. Within this, Ives juxtaposes the different sections of the orchestras in contrasting and clashing pairings (i.e. the ambient, static strings against the syncopated ragtime pianos against a brass street band). These juxtapositions are a prevalent theme in the works of Ives, and can be seen most notably in The Unanswered Question, Three Places in New England, and the Symphony No. 4. Ives uses quotation in Central Park in the Dark, using common themes from popular tunes of the day in his piece. He quotes the popular tune Hello! Ma Baby within the ragtime pianos and the Washington Post March within the street band. Central Park in the Dark is clearly a programmatic work, as can be derived from Ives's own detailed narrative describing the piece. Ives's work often relies on programmatic/narrative themes, allowing him to provide guidance through his dense scores. Performance and recording The first documented performance of the piece was in New York on May 11, 1946, by the chamber orchestra students from Juilliard Graduate School conducted by Theodore Bloomfield. It was performed at an all-Ives concert at the McMillin Theatre at Columbia University as part of the Second Annual Festival of Contemporary America Music. Ives, in a letter for Elliott Carter remembered a different initial performance. In relation to programs to be printed for the concert Ives wrote: The piece was first recorded in 1951 by the Polymusic Chamber Orchestra, under the direction of Will Lorin by Polymusic and has since been recorded by many orchestral groups. Influence In \\"An Ives Celebration: Papers and Panels of the Charles Ives Centennial Festival Conference\\", Hans G. Helms discussed the \\"strange historical coincidence\\" between Ives's Central Park in the Dark and Karlheinz Stockhausen's Gruppen for three orchestras. He found that after a performance of Central Park in the Dark by the West German Radio Symphony Orchestra, Stockhausen came out with Gruppen, which had very similar musical qualities to the Ives piece, such as independent lines represented through individual players and dividing the orchestra spatially.Hitchcock, Wiley H., ed and Perlis, Vivian, ed. 1977.

It is located to the north of Tamor River in the mountainous area in the northwest of Taplejung District bordering Tibet, China. Lately the river flowing next to the village is gradually expanding towards the village posing a serious threat of submerging the village. Olangchung is surrounded by Lelep village to the east and Tibet to the north, Sankhuwasabha District to west and Mikkwakhola rural municipality to south. It was once a strategic place between Tibet, Nepal and Sikkim. Historically Tipta La the pass connecting the area with Tibet was an important trade route. In addition, Olangchung Gola was the trade hub for surrounding villages such as Yangma, Ghunsa, Khangbachey, Lungthung, Lelep. Gola means \\"market\\" in the local language. In fact, the name \\"Olangchung\\" came from a folklore involving a wolf and a trader. The Gorkha war between Nepal and Tibet was negotiated in this tiny village. The Chogyal of Sikkim, fearing incarceration by British India, went into hiding here, ready to escape into Tibet, though he was captured later. In late 2016, China built a road connection on their side to the border at Tiptala Bhanjyang (Tipta La). In June 2017, Chinese construction crew constructed a dirt track from the border to Olangchung Gola. The funding of was provided by local consumers‚Äô committee. There is no road to the village from the south. In 2019, the Chinese government allocated addition funding to upgrade the road. Olangchung Gola is the last village before crossing the Lumbasumba La pass to the west to the remote village of Thudam along the high Great Himalayan Trail system. There is one lodge for trekkers with camping space in Olangchung Gola. People The Walung people are the indigenous inhabitants of the region around Olangchung Gola.

He was the first studio drummer of Siouxsie and the Banshees. He joined the band in January 1977, he had attended their first live appearance at the 100 Club a few months earlier and had been impressed by their performance. Morris's first studio recording with the group was in November 1977 when they recorded their first John Peel session for BBC radio. Music journalist Kris Needs said : \\"Like as a rhythm machine for feet and guts Kenny Morris' drumming is unorthodox, primitive (in a tribal sense) and far removed from the clicking hi-hats of the fly-strength paradiddle merchants\\". He played mostly toms. He has been cited as a major influence by several drummers of the post-punk era including Stephen Morris of Joy Division, Kevin Haskins of Bauhaus, and Paul Ferguson of Killing Joke. During the recording of the band's debut single \\"Hong Kong Garden\\", producer Steve Lillywhite suggested him to not record all the drums at the same time. Morris did the bass drum and the snare drum first. Then he did the cymbals and the tom-toms later. Lillywhite also added echo on the drums, adding significant space to the entire recording. NME wrote that this Lillywhite's work with Morris \\"revolutionis[ed] the post-punk band's sound with an innovative approach to laying down the drums\\". Morris played on the albums The Scream in 1978 and Join Hands and left the band in September 1979. Life and career Kenny Morris was born from Irish parents. He attended St Ignatius' College in Enfield, where he became a friend of future collaborator and film director John Maybury. Morris then attended Barnet College in London.Frame, Pete.

It is the channel that is mostly, or fully, dedicated to the reproduction of the dialogue of an audiovisual program. The speaker(s) connected to the center channel are placed in the center of and behind the perforated projection screen, to give the effect that sounds from the center channel are coming from the screen. In many home surround sound units, the center channel is positioned above or below the video screen. In the post-production process of filmmaking and video production sound editing, dialogue can be mapped to other speakers when story action and direction require it, such as when the person talking is off- screen, but it is rare that there is vocal content that is completely absent from the center channel. In material without accompanying visuals (e.g. music), the center channel simply reproduces sound intended to come from immediately in front of the listener, which usually includes the lead vocals, which are rarely panned hard left or right. The center channel also anchors the sound field, eliminating phantom images such as those that plagued quadraphonic sound if the speakers were not precisely placed. The center channel eliminates the need of creating a phantom center with left and right stereo speakers. The center channel provides image stabling effects and is considered the most important channel for film production. History The need for a center speaker to locate screen-centered sounds has been recognised since the Bell labs experiments in stereo sound from the 1930s, and multi- channel cinema sound systems, starting with the first commercial stereophonic film (Fantasia-1941) have always included one. Post-war stereo sound in theaters initially came from separate magnetic film reproducers synchronised to the picture, but in the 1950s systems using magnetic stripes on the film itself came into use. Cinemascope used four such tracks (left, center, right and surround), and the subsequent Todd-AO 70mm system used six (left, left- center, center, right-center and right, plus a single surround channel). Unfortunately these magnetic systems were not only very expensive, but were also unreliable and so were little used, the industry preferring to stay with the tried, tested (and cheap) mono optical track. Dolby Stereo was introduced by Dolby Laboratories in 1975. It divided the existing soundtrack area of a 35mm film print into two, allowing a two-channel recording. Each of these two channels used Dolby A type noise reduction (later replaced by Dolby SR type). In addition a matrix, similar in principle to those used for the existing matrix-type quadraphonic systems, allowed the audio for left, center and right speakers, plus a single surround channel to be carried by the two tracks. Thus Dolby Stereo provided a similar stereo performance to that previously only available in the cinema by the magnetic tracks on 4-track Cinemascope or 6-track Todd-AO (70mm) formats, but at far lower cost. Dolby Pro Logic is the name used for the Dolby Stereo matrix when used in home theater systems. In recent years digital multi-channel sound systems, such as Dolby Digital and DTS, have become available which provide 6 or 8 discrete audio channels providing for not only the usual three screen speakers but also 2 or 4 groups of surround speakers and a sub-woofer. Center focus or dialog enhancement Many of the home theater units have a \\"center focus\\" or \\"dialog enhancement\\" option that provides options for the dialogue reproduction, as well as the overall content mapped to the center and front channels. Common setting include modes that map dialogue strictly to the center channel (to the best ability of the decoder), modes that emphasize vocals for clear dialogue--and modes that mix the center and front channels, mapping some vocals to the front channels, and some non-vocal audio content to the center channel. It may also simply raise the volume level of the center channel. DTS:X processing may include \\"Dialog Control\\", the ability to isolate and control dialog levels independent of other ambient noises. Rear/back center channel 6.1 channel surround systems such as Dolby Pro Logic IIx, Dolby Digital EX and DTS-ES use a single rear surround channel in addition to the traditional left and right surround channels.

She wrote a celebrated account of her travels in India, and two novels that sold well. She was also an accomplished amateur artist. Family ties Born in Westminster, Eden was the seventh daughter of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland, and his wife Eleanor Elliot. She was the great-great-great- aunt of Prime Minister Anthony Eden. In her late thirties, she and her sister Fanny travelled to India, where her brother George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland was in residence there as Governor-General from 1835 to 1842. She wrote accounts of her time in India, later collected in the volume Up The Country: Letters Written to Her Sister from the Upper Provinces of India (1867). While the emphasis of her Indian writings was on travel descriptions, local colour and details of the ceremonial and social functions that she attended, Eden also provided a perceptive record of the major political events that occurred during her brother's term of office. These included the total destruction of a British/Indian army during the retreat from Kabul in 1842; a disaster for which George Eden was held partly responsible. Fiction Eden wrote two successful novels: The Semi-Detached House (1859) and The Semi-Attached Couple (1860). The latter was written in 1829, but not published until 1860. Both have a comic touch that critics have compared with that of Jane Austen, who was Emily's favourite author.\\"Not new but fresh\\", Time Magazine, 23 June 1947. The first of the two has been described as \\"an accomplished study in the social contrasts of aristocratic style, bourgeois respectability and crass vulgarity.\\"John Sutherland: Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction (1988), quoted in XIX Century Fiction, Part I, A‚ÄìK (Jarndyce, Bloomsbury, 2019). Eden's letters were published by Violet Dickinson, a close friend of Virginia Woolf. They contain memorable comments on English public life, most famously her welcome for the new King William IV as \\"an immense improvement on the last unforgiving animal George IV ‚Äî this man at least wishes to make everybody happy.\\" Emily Eden's niece Eleanor Lena Eden also took to writing, mainly children's books under the pseudonym Lena. The structure of her 1867 novel Dumbleton Common, which has \\"Little Miss Patty\\" detailing gossip in a hamlet outside London, was inspired by Cranford.XIX Century Fiction, Part I, A‚ÄìK (Jarndyce, Bloomsbury, 2019). Lord Melbourne Emily Eden never married and was financially well enough off not to need to write, but did so out of passion. After the death of Caroline Lamb, mutual friends hoped she might marry Lord Melbourne, who had become a close friend, although she claimed to find him \\"bewildering\\" and to be shocked by his profanity. Melbourne's biographer Lord David Cecil remarks that it might have been an excellent thing if they had married, but \\"love is not the child of wisdom, and neither of them wanted to.\\"David Cecil, Lord Melbourne (Constable and Co., London, 1965). Personality Her letters explored London, the colonies, and the high seas. Prudence Hannay argues that armed with \\"strong feelings and a forthright outlook on life, acute powers of observation and a gift of beautifully translating into words the sense of the ridiculous\\", she devoted her life to writing.Prudence Hannay, \\"Emily Eden as a Letter-Writer,\\" History Today (1971) 21#7 pp 491-501. In a 2013 history of her brother's term as Governor General in India, Emily Eden is described as a \\"waspish but adoring\\" sister, whose diary was to become one of the most celebrated travel accounts of the period.

A. Wyke- Smith and illustrated by the Punch cartoonist George Morrow. It was originally published in Britain by Ernest Benn in September 1927, and later published in the U.S. in 1928 by Harper & Brothers. It is notable as an inspiration source for J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. Plot summary The Marvellous Land of Snergs is set on a fictional island somewhere on Earth, but difficult to reach. On the island is a colony of children (rescued from neglect by the redoubtable Miss Watkyns), the crew of the Flying Dutchman, and the Snergs, a race of short, thick-set, helpful people. Unfortunately Golithos, a reformed (but relapsing) ogre, and Mother Meldrum, a wicked witch, also live there. Also in the forest across the river there are tigers, brown bears, European dragons, ghouls, and unicorns. When Sylvia and Joe run away for a big adventure their lives are in deadly peril when they fall into the clutches of Golithos and Mother Meldrum. Gorbo the Snerg and Baldry the court jester come to the rescue. Snergs and Hobbits J. R. R. Tolkien, author of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, is known to have read The Marvellous Land of Snergs to his children. He said: \\"I should like to record my own love and my children's love of E. A. Wyke-Smith's Marvellous Land of Snergs, at any rate of the snerg-element of that tale, and of Gorbo the gem of dunderheads, jewel of a companion in an escapade.\\" The similarities between the races of snergs and hobbits have led to speculation that the book was a major inspiration. They are similar in their physical descriptions, their love of communal feasting, and their names, particularly Gorbo and Bilbo. In all the books there are also journeys through dangerous forests and caverns. Reviews The review in The Tolkien Collector notes the points of similarity with Peter Pan ‚Äì a remote island populated by disparate groups ‚Äì and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland ‚Äì a haphazard plot and fantastic creatures. It criticizes the inconsistencies in the island story and the stylistic flaws which come from an over-awareness of the child audience, but considers that \\"Wyke-Smith transcends such superficial, dreamlike stories by creating a true fairy story, along the lines that were later elucidated by Tolkien\\". David Bratman, reviewing for the Mythopoeic Society, calls the book a \\"long and discursive novel, lacking the clear-cut structure and tight plotting of The Hobbit,\\" but says it nonetheless is \\"an intriguing book that well deserves this resurrection from the dusty out-of-print shelves.\\" References External links * * Category:1927 British novels Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:Novels set on fictional islands ","title":"The Marvellous Land of Snergs"},{"id":"20294468","text":"Sikaicha is a village development committee in the Himalayas of Taplejung District in the Mechi Zone of north-eastern Nepal.

Formed during the seventh season of the German version of the international television talent show Popstars, Popstars ‚Äì Just 4 Girls, the original line-up consisted of singers Leonore Bartsch (Leo), Gabriella De Almeida Rinne (Gabby), Antonella Trapani (Anto), and Victoria Ulbrich (Vici). On 7 July 2010, it was announced that both Antonella and Victoria had left the group, to be replaced by new members, Selina Herrero and Ronja Hilbig.Queensberry ‚Äì Selina Herrero und Ronja Hilbig die neuen Bandmitglieder. Popstars-News.de, 14 September 2010 The band's debut album Volume I was released in December 2008 and reached gold status in Germany. It produced the two singles No Smoke and I Can't Stop Feeling, both becoming top thirty successes in the charts. In February 2008, Queensberry served as the opening act for the Pussycat Dolls's Doll Domination Tour in selected European countries. In November 2009, the second studio album On My Own was released. For the soundtrack of the film Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, Queensberry recorded The Song with The Chipettes in December 2009. History Formation on Popstars The Queensberry members were selected on the ProSieben channel's seventh installment of the Popstars series, entitled Popstars ‚Äì Just 4 Girls, which set about producing a four-piece girl group, following the initial success of previous all-female Popstars acts such as the No Angels (2000) and Monrose (2006). No stranger to Popstars, Leonore Bartsch, who originates from Cologne, had already taken part in the Monrose season and was the last contestant to leave before the finale. In June and July 2008, over 2,300 hopefuls turned up to open auditions in Dortmund, Dresden, Hamburg and Rust which required both singing and dancing experience. The judges consisted of dancer and choreographer Detlef Soost, Dutch singer Loona and German rapper Sido. Danish singer Kate Hall served as this season's vocal coach. After numerous elimination rounds, sixteen candidates flew to Sharm El Sheik, Egypt, where they intensified their training in singing, dancing, and fitness. In the end, twelve girls made it into the band house near Munich, of which six started work on the band's debut album. Beforehand, the top eight contestants, as Popstars: Just 4 Girls, released the single I Believe In X-Mas promoted with a music video. Leo, German-Brazilian Gabriella De Almeida Rinne, who originates from Berlin, and Victoria Ulbrich, all managed to make it into the Queensberry line-up prior to the season's live finale in Hilversum, Netherlands, with all of them having won special stage performances, even though Victoria had had to go into hiatus for four weeks due to her mother's sudden death. Fourth member, Swiss-born, German-Italian, Antonella, was not announced until 18 December, when the show was resumed, based on her having sold most of her version of the group's debut album Volume I (which had been released in three different versions, a week prior to the finale, and featuring one finalist each) and her winning a public televoting over fellow campaigners Patricia Ivanauskas and Katharina Kobert (KayKay). Ironically, although each of the Queensberry girls had already performed together with all of their future bandmates (varying from duets to quartets), at some point throughout the season, it had never happened that all four of them made up one working group together. However, a couple of times, three of the future band members were featured in one quartet, but then with either Leo or Antonella not being part of it.  2008/2009: Volume 1 and On My Own  Queensberry performing with the original line-up - from Left to Right: Gabriella De Almeida Rinne, Leonore Bartsch, Antonella Trapani & Victoria Ulbrich With the final members of the group in place, the quartet signed a recording contract with Warner Music Group sub- label Starwatch Music. In January 2009, the album Volume I was certified gold by the IFPI, and in February, the band released their first main single, a double A-single consisting of the ballad I Can't Stop Feeling and their promotional song No Smoke - a cover version of the 2008 record by Canadian Idol winner Eva Avila. The single has also been covered by Nicki French. The song reached a moderate number 23 on the German Singles Chart, the lowest- chart peak for any Popstars winner's debut single, while No Smoke made it to the top thirty in Switzerland based on downloads only. In February 2009, the band served as the official opening act of The Pussycat Dolls' Doll Domination Tour in selected European countries such as Austria, Germany and the Netherlands. In June the same year, a deluxe edition of Volume I was released featuring additional tracks (including the Too Young single) and remixes. On 6 May 2009, it was announced that the group was working on its second studio album. The track list included their previous summer song-single called Too Young, the second album's first single Hello (Turn Your Radio On) and one song, which was performed live by former Popstars - Just 4 Girls participant Patricia, called Scandalous. The album was released on 6 November 2009, with its promotional single Hello (Turn Your Radio On) released on 23 October 2009. This album was planned to be the band's first US-album. On 18 June 2010, the girls released two new songs as the soundtrack for the Hanni und Nanni movie, while their record contract with Warner Music in Germany was discontinued.  2010‚Äì2013: Line-up changes, Chapter 3 and disbandment  Queensberry; Pink Chocolate Tour (2011) On 7 July 2010, the group announced on its website that Anto and Vici had both departed from the group. Selina Herrero, a German- Spanish singer from Bad Kreuznach in Germany, who first hit the German single charts in 2008 with Don‚Äôt Be Shy and You Can‚Äôt Stop Me, and Ronja Hilbig, a singer from Hamburg, who had played the role of Nala in the German version of the musical The Lion King and had been a member of Die Lollipops, were brought in as new members. The first appearance of the new quartet was scheduled for 15 July 2010 on VIVA Live. The group made plans to shoot a reality show called A Day in the Life of Queensberry to be shown all over the USA. In October 2010, the group recorded its earlier single I Can't Stop Feeling in Spanish as Yo No Puedo Vivir Sin Ti. The song, written by Teemu Brunila and Kid Crazy, and adapted for Spanish by Jos√© Valdes, was first performed on VIVA Live. On 3 December 2010, Queensberry announced it would make a label change and release an album in 2011. During spring and summer of 2011, the group performed throughout Germany on their Pink Chocolate Tour. The girls guest star on the album of German rapper KittyKat, and featured on a single called No Time For Suckers In April 2012 it was announced that Selina Herrero left the band and went back to school. The remaining members released their third album, Chapter 3, as a trio on 22 June 2012. The first single of the album, Timeless, was released on 1 June 2012. Both album and single charted very low in the German Charts at 90 and 91 respectively. Despite failing at repeating their former successes, a music video for the second single Girl Like You was shot. The single was released on 31 August 2012 and became the first single of the group that failed to chart within the German Top 100. In August 2012, band member Leo had to drop out from several scheduled concerts of the band due to health issues. Therefore, De Almeida Rinne and Hilbig did several shows as a duo. In October 2012, Leo announced on her official website, that she has left the band.. leo4u.com. Retrieved 13 November 2012. The remaining two members then decided to put future plans for the band on hold to focus on solo projects. In summer 2013, however, it came into the open that they had decided not to perform any longer together.

The Institute lies at the heart of a thriving bio-medical-science campus in Liverpool and has integrated bioscience structures with internationally recognized expertise ranging from electrons to ecosystems. Its science serves several key societal themes including food security, health and welfare, diagnostics, biodiversity and conservation and biofuels. Career On 19 November 2008, whilst in his previous position as Professor of Rheumatology and Tissue Engineering at the University of Bristol where he was Head of School of Cellular and Molecular Medicine,http://www.bris.ac.uk/cellmolmed/ it was reported in the LancetLancet 2008 volume 372, pp2023-2030 that an artificially-grown organ had been successfully transplanted into a woman in Barcelona, Claudia Castillo, a breakthrough in which Hollander played a key role as the only stem cell scientist on the team. The team was led by Paolo Macchiarini who has been accused of research fraud. Subsequently the work has been criticised after several of the patients died and there have been calls for the paper to be retracted.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUfgvLN3vBg The transplant technique has been described as scientifically unfounded. In 2009, Biddy Baxter, the editor of the children's television programme Blue Peter published a selection of children's letters received by the Blue Peter team. Amongst them was a letter from Hollander who had written in 1973 that he knew how to save lives. He now says that he owes his career to Miss Baxter: \\"If her letter had shown any hint of ridicule or disbelief I might perhaps never have trained to become a medical scientist or been driven to achieve the impossible dream, and really make a difference to a human being's life.\\" Hollander grew up in North West London, one of six children. He was a pupil at Christ's College Finchley and from there went to The University of Bath where he read for a degree in Pharmacology and graduated with First Class Honours in 1987. He then moved to The University of Bristol where he undertook his doctoral research in the field of cartilage degradation in arthritis. He was awarded his PhD in 1990.Inflammation and joint damage in rhuematoid arthritis (1990). University of Bristol PhD thesis He then moved to Montreal, Canada where he was a postdoctoral scientist at McGill University for three years, again studying cartilage degradation in arthritis. In 1993 he was awarded a three-year Fellowship from The Arthritis Research Campaign (now Arthritis Research UK)http://www.arthritisresearchuk.org to be based in The University of Sheffield where he was appointed as lecturer. He was promoted to Reader in 1999 and he was then appointed to his Chair at The University of Bristol in 2000. In 2010, The Times newspaper ranking of Britain's 100 most important scientists included him at number 39 on the list.

Ogilvie Transportation Center (known more casually as the \\"North Western Station\\"); Milwaukee District North and West, North Central Service, SouthWest Service, BNSF Railway, and Heritage Corridor converge in Union Station (which is also the nexus of Amtrak); the Rock Island District arrives in the LaSalle Street Station; and the Metra Electric District arrives in Millennium Station (formerly Randolph Street Terminal). The Metra Electric District is Chicago's oldest continuing commuter train (1856), and shares the railway with the South Shore Line, operated by the Northwest Indiana Commuter Transit District (\\"NICTD\\"), which is a separate but analogous quasi-governmental entity, partially funded by the RTA. The South Shore Line is an interurban railroad that operates between Chicago and South Bend, Indiana. Like the Metra Electric District, it arrives and departs from Millennium Station. =Inter-city= Amtrak's Empire Builder departs Union Station. Amtrak owns and operates Union Station, the fourth-largest intercity passenger hub in the United States. The station is the focus of many of Amtrak's transcontinental routes. Unlike most of Amtrak's major stations, all trains calling at Union Station either originate or terminate there; passengers coming through Chicago must transfer to another train to reach their destination. It provides connections to Metra and the 'L.' Before Amtrak's takeover of passenger service in 1971, trains ran out of Central Station, Dearborn Station, LaSalle Street Station and Chicago and North Western Terminal as well as Union Station. =Chicago Express Loop= The Chicago Express Loop is a proposed high speed rapid transit line connecting the Loop to O'Hare airport. Tourist trolleys The City of Chicago offered free tourist trolleys that served the downtown area. The \\"trolleys\\" were actually buses painted to look like historical streetcars. They ran every 20 to 30 minutes and served areas popular with tourists that didn't have 'L' stations, such as the Museum Campus, Navy Pier, and the Magnificent Mile. The Free Trolley service was permanently discontinued in 2009. The free trolleys should not be confused with the private-sector Chicago Trolley Company, which offers guided tours and charge fares. They serve different routes but largely the same downtown area. Their vehicles are also buses rather than real trolleys. Chicago Public Transportation Statistics The average Chicago commuter spends 86 minutes every day traveling to and from work on public transit. Of public transit riders, 28.% ride for more than 2 hours every day. On average, commuters wait at stops or stations for 15 minutes; 21% of riders wait for over 20 minutes. The average trip is , while 28.% travel over in a single direction. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Taxis Chicago taxicabs are privately operated under a medallion license from the city. Chicago taxi regulations were revamped in a 2012 reform package backed by Mayor Rahm Emanuel; the package raised the \\"flag pull\\" initial hire charge by $1, mandated credit card readers and GPS, and placed new limits on fleet age. City and private initiatives have increased the proportion of hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles from less than one percent to over 74 percent of the city's cab fleet since 2008. By water Chicago waterways are used extensively for commercial shipping, passenger ferry service, and recreational boating. Navigable waterways within Chicago include Lake Michigan, the Chicago River, the Calumet River, and the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. In part, these waterways comprise the Chicago Area Waterway System, which forms the only inland link between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. This potential link was a major factor in the establishment of Chicago itself. Commercial shipping The Port of Chicago, once centered on the Chicago River but since moved to the Lake Calumet area, is responsible for Chicago's commercial shipping traffic. Passenger ferry service Water taxi in Chicago Passenger ferry service in Chicago is handled by commercial water taxis operating on defined routes on published schedules. Shoreline Sightseeing offers water taxi service along the Chicago River with stops at Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue, and Adams Street. They offer a separate route from Navy Pier to the Museum Campus. Wendella Boats operates the Chicago Water Taxi which offers scheduled service along the Chicago River with stops at Michigan Avenue, Clark Street, Madison Street (Ogilvie and Union train stations), Chicago Avenue, North Avenue, and Ping Tom Park in Chinatown. Recreational boating Recreational boat traffic in Chicago includes tour boats, sailboats, powerboats, electric boats, canoes, and kayaks. This traffic originates from numerous private and commercial marinas and slips, and the Chicago Park District operates a municipal harbor system for the seasonal storage of recreational watercraft in Lake Michigan. With accommodations for 6000 boats, it is the largest system of its kind in the nation. Boat rentals are available on both the Chicago River and within harbors on Lake Michigan. Cycling Cyclists commuting on the Kinzie cycle track in Chicago Chicago maintains a 290-mile network of bikeways - including shared use paths, cycle tracks, and bike lanes - for private, public, and commercial bicycle use. Bicycles are allowed to operate on all Chicago roadways, except limited access highways. A bicycle sharing system known as Divvy operates thousands of public bikes at 580 stations in Chicago, Evanston, and Oak Park. Pedicabs are available for hire at various locations and events around Chicago with high pedestrian traffic. Bicycles are available for rent at rental shops concentrated along the lakefront in the Loop and Near North Side community areas. Several delivery companies operate bicycle courier services mainly in the Loop area. Bicycles on transit Bicycles are permitted on CTA buses via front-mounted bicycle racks and onboard CTA trains weekdays excluding the rush-hours from 7-9 a.m. and 4-6 p.m. On weekends and holidays, bicycles are allowed on trains all day except for special events. Bicycles are allowed onboard Metra commuter rail service during off-peak and non-event times and in reverse peak directions during rush hours. Bicycles are only allowed on designated South Shore Line commuter rail service trains as part of a pilot program active during non-winter months. Bicycles are allowed on water taxis during off-peak and weekend hours.

Life Son of Mario Mordechai Pacifici and Gilda Borghi, Pacifici descended from an ancient Sephardic and religious Jewish family of Spanish origin and of rabbinical tradition settled in Tuscany (first in Leghorn, then in Florence) in the 16th century. After the \\"Liceo Classico\\" (Classical Studies High School) he attended the University of Florence, where he graduated summa cum laude in Classics (Lettere Classiche) in 1926, and in 1927 he was awarded by the Rabbinical College of Florence-- where he had studied under important scholars such as Elia Samuele Artom, Umberto Cassuto, Shemuel Zvi Margulies--the title of Chach√†m ha shal√®m (Senior Rabbi).

Chief Rabbi of the Genoa Jewish Community (Comunit√† Israelitica di Genova) from 1936 until deported by the Nazis in 1943. Even during the difficult war years, Pacifici never stopped his spiritual and teaching activity. He continued his rabbinical duties between 1942 and 1943 with the Jewish refugees of the Ferramonti di Tarsia internment camp, located in Cosenza in the region of Calabria. Unwilling to leave his Genoa Community and thus abandon his remaining members, Rav Pacifici was captured by deceit in 1943 by the Nazis and sent to Auschwitz, where he was killed with his wife Wanda Abenaim and many other members of the Pacifici family. The \\"Largo Riccardo Pacifici\\" square in the heart of Genoa was named after him in 1966. He was the grandfather of the past Rome Jewish Community President Riccardo Pacifici.

This includes schools competing in: * Division I-AA from 1978 through 2005 * Division I FCS since 2006 Teams in bold italics are now in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS); those in plain italics either play football in lower divisions or not at all. Teams followed by an asterisk (*) dropped football. Dates reflect when a team began play in I-AA/FCS, not when it became eligible for postseason play. As of the current 2020‚Äì21 season (delayed from its normal fall 2020 schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic), no school is transitioning from FCS to FBS. The most recent school to complete such a transition was Liberty, which began its FBS transition in 2017, was classified as an FBS independent in 2018, and became a full FBS member in 2019. Idaho downgraded its football team from FBS to FCS, and rejoined its all-sports home of the Big Sky Conference as a football member in July 2018. Also in July 2018, North Alabama started a transition from NCAA Division II, joining the ASUN Conference for non-football sports at that time, with the football team playing as an FCS independent in 2018 before joining the Big South Conference in 2019. Two teams joined the FCS ranks in 2020‚ÄîDixie State and Tarleton State. Both schools started transitions to Division I, with the football teams becoming FCS independents while all other sports joined the non-football Western Athletic Conference. Two teams have announced their future entry into the FCS‚ÄîAugustana and St. Thomas, incumbent on Augustana's approval from the NCAA to leave Division II.

He is an assistant professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, and formerly a fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows and visiting faculty member at Google. He is an adjunct assistant professor of computer science at Rice University. Using mathematical and computational approaches, he has studied evolution in a range of contexts, including that of networks through evolutionary graph theory and languages in the field of culturomics. He has published scientific articles in a variety of disciplines. Lieberman Aiden has won awards including the Lemelson‚ÄìMIT Student Prize and the American Physical Society's Award for Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Research in Biological Physics. In 2009, Lieberman Aiden was named as one of 35 top innovators under 35 by Technology Review and in 2011 he was one of the recipients of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers. Early life and education  Lieberman grew up in Brooklyn with three siblings. He began computer programming at the age of seven. His father, Aharon Lieberman, was a technology entrepreneur and owned a factory in New Jersey. As a child Lieberman Aiden spoke Hebrew and Hungarian, making English his third language. Lieberman Aiden studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at Princeton, and earned a master's degree in History at Yeshiva University. He proceeded to complete a joint PhD in mathematics and bioengineering at the Harvard‚ÄìMIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, where he was advised by Eric Lander and Martin Nowak. Research and career Lieberman Aiden contributed to the founding of evolutionary graph theory along with his PhD supervisor Martin Nowak. He has since been involved in researching the three dimensional structure of the human genome and the field of culturomics. The fractal globule model (left) of three-dimensional genome structure suggested by Lieberman Aiden and coworkers contrasted with an equilibrium model (right) 3D genome structure Lieberman Aiden was part of a team of scientists from the University of Massachusetts Medical School and MIT that first suggested human DNA folds into a fractal globule rather than an equilibrium globule. This finding explains how each cell's genome is able to be heavily compacted without forming a knot. Lieberman Aiden and coworkers invented a variant of chromosome conformation capture called \\"Hi-C\\" which produces a genome-wide measure of contact probabilities that point to a 3-dimensional genome structure. This technique combines existing chromosome capture methodology with next-generation sequencing, enabling an all-versus- all measure of chromatin contacts. In 2009 this work was published in the journal Science and was featured as a cover illustration. Following the publication, Lieberman Aiden was quoted as saying: In 2014, he served as a senior author on an article in Cell which described a refined method of Hi-C which his team used to describe the fundamental organization of DNA. Erez Lieberman Aiden lecturing on culturomics at Harvard University in 2011 Culturomics Lieberman Aiden was involved in the analysis of a corpus of around 5 million digitised books, applying data mining techniques to advance the new field of culturomics. Leiberman Aiden was involved in a project to digitise Anglo-Saxon texts in 2004, analysis of which provided supporting evidence for verb regularisation, a process whereby irregular verbs become increasingly regular over time. After the announcement of Google Books, Lieberman Aiden approached Google's Director of Research Peter Norvig and was permitted to statistically analyse their data. His work contributed to the Google Ngram Viewer, released in December 2010, which makes use of culturomics ideas to produce normalized historical trends for any sequence of letters. This project published a number of findings in the journal Science, including the changing dynamic of fame and instances of literary censorship during the Second World War. Awards and honors In 2008 Lieberman Aiden was awarded the Lemelson-MIT Student Prize for his work on the iShoe, meant to assist elderly people with balance problems and prevent falls that could cause injury.ScienceDaily (July 24, 2008). Balance problems? Step into the IShoe,Science Daily. The following year, the iShoe was listed as one of \\"20 New Biotech Breakthroughs that Will Change Medicine\\" by Popular Mechanics. A year later Lieberman Aiden was named as one of 35 top innovators under 35 (TR35) by MIT's Technology Review magazine.MIT (September 10, 2009).2009 Young Innovators under 35, Erez Lieberman-Aiden, 29, Harvard University/MIT., Technology Review. In 2010, the American Physical Society presented Lieberman Aiden with the Award for Outstanding Doctoral Thesis Research in Biological Physics for his thesis titled \\"Evolution and the emergence of structure\\". His doctoral dissertation was also awarded the Hertz Thesis Prize. Lieberman Aiden is also the recipient of an NIH Director's New Innovator Award and was named, along with 95 other American researchers, as a recipient of the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2011. Personal life Erez Lieberman married Aviva Presser in 2005; following the marriage both husband and wife appended to their surnames \\"Aiden\\", which means Eden in Hebrew and, in Gaelic, little fire. They have a son named Gabriel Galileo, a daughter called Maayan Amara and another boy called Judah Avraham. Outside of scientific interests, Lieberman Aiden participated in a modern art collaboration with Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick which was exhibited in galleries in the United States and Europe. Lieberman Aiden and his wife founded Bears Without Borders, a nonprofit organisation which distributes stuffed toys to the developing world.

Spon, 1871 pp. 41-44 One end of the faulted cable is connected through a pair of resistors to the voltage source. Also a null detector is connected. The other end of the cable is shorted. The bridge is brought to balance by changing the values of RB1 and RB2, which is achieved when: \\\\frac{R_x}{R_g + R_y} = \\\\frac{R_{B1}}{R_{B2}} which is equivalent to: R_x = (R_g + R_y) \\\\cdot \\\\frac{R_{B1}}{R_{B2}} The value of resistance Rx is proportional the length Lx, thus the location of the fault can be calculated: L_x = 2 \\\\cdot L \\\\cdot \\\\frac{R_{B1}}{R_{B1}+R_{B2}} where L is the total length of the cable under test - a value proportional to Rg. The method assumes a single fault exists, of low resistance compared with the undamaged cable insulation resistance, and that the cable conductors have uniform resistance per unit length. Varley loop The similar Varley loop uses fixed resistors for RB1 and RB2, and inserts a variable resistor in the faulted leg. Test sets for cable testing can be connected for either bridge technique. If the fault resistance is high, the sensitivity of the Murray bridge is reduced and the Varley loop may be more suitable.

Ltd. with intention of serving on their Yokohama to New York route. The ship remained in service between Japan and United States for two years before being requisitioned by the Japanese Army. She was bombed and damaged during her first Army mission and subsequently torpedoed and sunk by a Dutch submarine in December 1941. Design and construction The ship was launched in 1939 and was notable for being the most advanced freighter of its time. It was commissioned by the Imperial Japanese Army to transport troops in World War II and was part of the Japanese Invasion of Malaya on 8 December 1941. Operational history Imperial Japanese Army Along with its sister ship and Sakura Maru, she was carrying around 5,000 troops during the landings at Kota Bharu. Awazisan Maru was bombed by a Lockheed Hudson aircraft of No. 1 Squadron RAAF, set afire and was abandoned to drift. It is believed that the freighter sunk or was subsequently torpedoed by the Dutch submarine K XII. The invasion of Malaya preceded the attack on Pearl Harbor by an hour and a half, making it the first Japanese campaign of World War II, likely making Awazisan Maru the very first casualty in the war. Awazisan Maru now lies in of water off the coast of Pantai Sabak in Kota Bharu and is fast becoming a popular diving destination due to its remarkable history. It is more popularly known amongst local divers as the Japanese Invasion Wreck.

Like his more famous contemporaries Michael Faraday and Joseph Henry, Page began his career as an astute natural philosopher who developed innovative work with natural phenomena through direct observation and experimenting. Toward the later part of their careers, the science of the day had moved on to a more mathematical emphasis in which these scientists did not participate. Through his exploratory experiments and distinctive inventions, Page developed a deep understanding of electromagnetism. He applied this understanding in the service of the US Patent Office, in support of other inventors, and in pursuing his own ill-fated dream of electromagnetic locomotion. His work had a lasting impact on telegraphy and in the practice and politics of patenting scientific innovation, challenging the rising scientific elitism that maintained 'the scientific do not patent'.Post, 1976a, p. 139 Family life Charles Grafton Page was born to Captain Jere Lee Page and Lucy Lang Page on January 25, 1812 in Salem, Massachusetts. Having eight siblings, four of each gender, he was the only one of five sons to pursue a career into mature adulthood. One of his brothers died in infancy. Brother George died from typhoid at age sixteen, brother Jery perished on a sea expedition to the Caribbean at age twenty-five, and Henry, afflicted by poliomyelitis, was not able to support himself. In writing to Charles Grafton during his final voyage, Jery expressed the family‚Äôs hope for his success: \\"You are the only classical Page in our book.\\"Post, (1976a). Quote p. 8. Page's curiosity about electricity was evident from childhood. At age nine, he climbed on top of his parents' house with a fire-shovel in an attempt to catch electricity during a thunderstorm. At age ten, he built an electrostatic machine that he used to shock his friends.(Lane), (1869). At sixteen, Page developed the \\"portable electrophorus,\\" which served as the foundation for his first published article in the American Journal of Science (Page, 1834). Other early interests, including botany, entomology (Page, 1836b), and floriculture, contributed to his scientific training and later avocations.Post, (1976a), p. 144-145. After graduating from medical school, Page continued to reside in his parents' Salem home and opened a small medical practice. In a well-stocked lab that he set up there, he experimented with electricity, demonstrated effects that no one had observed before, and improvised original apparatus that amplified these effects.(Lane) (1869), p. 3; Cavicchi, (2008), p. 893. When his father retired from a successful career as a sea captain in trade with East India, Page joined his family in relocating to rural Virginia outside Washington DC.Post,(1976a), p. 7 Page married Priscilla Sewall Webster in 1844. Priscilla was the younger sister of the wife of a Washington physician, Harvey Lindsly, who was among Page's colleagues. One son died in infancy. The couple brought up three sons and two daughters.(Lane) (1869), p. 17;Post,(1976a). p. 137,160. Their oldest daughter, Emelyn or Emmie, died less than a year before Page's own death.Post,(1976a), p. 63-5; 177 Their youngest son, Harvey Lindsly Page (1859‚Äì1934), was named for his uncle. He was a famous American architect and inventor, of San Antonio, Texas. http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpa75 Career Page pursued undergraduate studies at Harvard College from 1828‚Äì1832, studying chemistry under Professor John White Webster. A classmate at Salem Latin School who also attended college and medical school with him, Henry Wheatland described Page as popular, fun-loving, athletic, a fine singer and \\"a loved companion\\". Page participated in organizing a college chemical club where he demonstrated electricity and other phenomena. After receiving an M.D. from Harvard Medical School in 1836, he practiced medicine and gave public lectures on chemistry in Salem.(Lane) (1869), p. 2-3. When Page moved to northern Virginia in 1838, he continued his experimental research and set up a medical practice which he sustained for several years.Post,(1976a), p. 44 Page served as a patent examiner in the United States Patent Office in Washington, D.C. for two periods: 1842-1852 and 1861-1868. He became senior patent examiner during his first term. During the years intervening, he took up a business as a patent agent or solicitor to help other inventors secure patents, established and edited the short-lived The American Polytechnic Journal, and pursued his own interests in electromagnetism, floriculture and other areas.(Lane) (1869), p. 1-2; Post (1976a), p. 46, 142-145. As a patent agent, Page handled up to 50 successful patents a year, including patents for Eben Norton Horsford, Walter Hunt and others.Post, 1976a, p. 159. Page's 1861 return to the Patent Agency as an examiner occurred in the wake of numerous dismissals of patent office employees under the new Administration of Abraham Lincoln.Post, 1976a, p. 163-163. Page figured as a key witness in the Morse v. O'Reilly telegraph lawsuit of 1848.Post,(1976a), p. 71-72. However, when Morse sought an extension of his patent on telegraph apparatus twelve years later, Page refuted Morse's role as inventor and was perhaps influential in the extensions' denial.Post, 1976a, p. 164-170. From 1844-1849, Page was Professor of Chemistry and [Pharmacy] in the Medical Department at Columbian College in Washington, D.C.(Lane) (1869), p. 1. (now George Washington University). He held other public roles such as that of advising the choice of stone to be used in constructing the Smithsonian Institution and the Washington Monument to the committees in charge of these projects.Post,(1976a), p. 12. Throughout his life, Page published more than one-hundred articles over the course of three distinct periods: the late 1830s, the mid-1840s, and the early 1850s. The first period (1837‚Äì1840) was especially crucial in developing his analytic skills. Over 40 of his articles appeared in the American Journal of Science edited by Benjamin Silliman; some of these were reprinted at the time in William Sturgeon‚Äôs Annals of Electricity, Magnetism, and Chemistry printed in Great Britain. The Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Papers (1800‚Äì1863 volume) records many of Page's papers, however this listing is incomplete, as is that provided in (Post, 1976a, p. 207-213). Scientific accomplishments While still a medical student at Harvard, Page conducted a ground-breaking experiment which demonstrated the presence of electricity in an arrangement of a spiral conductor that no one had tried before. His experiment was a response to a short paper by Joseph Henry, announcing that a strong electric shock was obtained from a ribbon strip of copper, spiralled up between fabric insulation, at the moment when battery current stopped running in this conductor.Henry, 1835. These strong shocks manifested the electrical property of self-inductance which Faraday had identified in researches published prior to Henry's,Faraday, 1835. building on his own landmark discovery of electromagnetic induction.Faraday, 1831. Page seemed to be unaware of Faraday's analysis.Cavicchi, 2008, p. 893. Page's innovation was to construct a spiral conductor having cups filled with mercury as electrical connectors that were placed at various positions along its length. He then connected one terminal from an electrochemical battery to the inner cup of the spiral, and put the other battery terminal into some other cup of the spiral. The direct battery current flowed through the spiral, from cup to cup. He held a metal wand in each hand, and put these wands into the same two cups as where the battery terminals went ‚Äî or any other pair of cups. When an assistant removed one of the battery terminals, stopping the current from going in the spiral, Page received a shock. He reported stronger shocks when his hands covered more of the spiral's length than where direct battery current went. He even felt shocks from parts of the spiral where no direct battery current passed. He used acupuncture needles, pierced into his fingers, to amplify his sense of shock.Page, 1836a, 1837a; Cavicchi, 2005, 2008. Side view of Page‚Äôs 1837 spiral, showing connector cups spaced across its length.Page, 1837a, p. 131. While Page advocated the use of this shocking device as a medical treatment, an early form of electrotherapy,Page, 1836a, 1837a; Cavicchi, 2005, 2008. his own interest lay in its heightening of electrical tension, or voltage above that of the low voltage battery input, and in its other electrical behaviors. Page went on to improve the instrument, giving it the name 'Dynamic Multiplier'.Page, 1837b. In order for Page's instrument to produce the shock, the battery current had to be stopped. In order to experience another shock, the battery had to be started again, and then stopped. Page invented the first interrupters, to provide a repeatable means of connecting and disconnecting the circuit. In these devices, electrical flow is started and stopped as a rocking or rotary motion lifts electrical contacts out of a mercury pool. An electric motor effect is responsible for the continued operation of the switch.Page, 1837a, 1837b; Cavicchi, 2005. Crucial to Page's research with the spiral conductor was his capacity to explore and question the unknown, where the physical effects were enigmatic and the 'received theories'Page, 1837a, 139 inadequate. Page did not provide an explanation for what he found, yet he extended and amplified the apparatus and its unexpected behaviors. A recent reconstruction of Page's experiment corroborates the central role of ambiguity in his work, finding: Page's publication about his spiral instrument was well received in the American science community and in England, putting him into the upper ranks of American science at the time.Fleming, 1892; Post, 1976a. British experimenter William Sturgeon reprinted Page's article in his journal Annals of Electricity. Sturgeon provided an analysis of the electromagnetic effect involved;Sturgeon, 1837. Page drew on and expanded Sturgeon's analysis in his own later work. Sturgeon devised coils that were adaptations of Page's instrument, where battery current flowed through one, inner, segment of a coil, and electrical shock was taken from the entire length of a coil.Cavicchi, 2006. Through the input from Sturgeon, as well as his own continuing researches, Page developed coil instruments that were the foundation for the eventual induction coil.Cavicchi, 2006. These instruments had two wires. One wire, termed the primary, carried battery current; a shock was taken across the ends of the other much longer wire, termed the secondary (see transformer). The primary wire was wound concentrically over an iron core; the secondary was wound over that. Page developed a deep understanding of the underlying behaviors.Page, 1838a, 1838b, 1838c In Page's published account of his coil, he termed it and its contact breaker the 'Compound Electro-Magnet and Electrotome'.Page, 1839, p. 253. Page's patent model for this coil is on display at the National Museum of American History. Charles Grafton Page's double helix coil, as marketed in 1848 for $8.00 by Boston instrument maker Daniel Davis Jr.Davis, 1848, Fig. 183, p. 37 In a subsequent experiment with a spiral conductor, Page mounted it rigidly between the poles of a suspended horseshoe magnet. When current stopped flowing in the spiral, a tone could be heard from the magnet, which Page termed 'galvanic music'.Page, 1837c. Thirty years later, Alexander Graham Bell cited Page's galvanic music as an important precedent for his development of telephony.Bell, 1876-1877. An astute observer and exploratory experimenter, Page invented many other electromagnetic devices. Some of these involved the electromagnetic motor effect in original ways. Many prototypes devised by Page were turned into products manufactured and marketed by Boston instrument-maker Daniel Davis, Jr., the first American to specialize in magnetic philosophical instruments.Davis, (1838), (1842). While consulting with Samuel F.B. Morse and Alfred Lewis Vail on the development of [telegraph] apparatus and techniques, Page contributed to the adoption of suspended wires using a ground return, designed a signal receiver magnet and tested a magneto as a source to substitute for the battery.[Post,(1976a), p. 66-68.] During the 1840s, Page developed what he termed the Axial Engine. This instrument used an electromagnetic solenoid coil to draw an iron rod into its hollow interior. The rod's displacement opened a switch that stopped current from flowing in the coil; then being unattracted, the rod reverted out of the coil, and this cycle repeated again. The resulting reciprocating motion of the rod back and forth, into and out of the coil, was converted to rotary motion by the mechanism. After demonstrating uses of this engine to run saws and pumps, Page successfully petitioned the U.S. Senate for funds to produce an electromagnetic locomotive, based on this design.Post,1972; 1976a, p. 81-82. With these funds plus personal resources that took him into debt, Page built and tested the first full-sized electromagnetic locomotive, preceded only by the 1842 battery-powered model-sized Galvani of Scottish inventor Robert Davidson. Along the way, Page constructed a series of motors, revisions of the axial engine having different dimensions and mechanical features, which he tested thoroughly. The motor operated on large electrochemical cells, acid batteries having as electrodes zinc and costly platinum, with fragile clay diaphragms between the cells. Page's 1850 American Association for the Advancement of Science presentation about his progress impressed Joseph Henry, Benjamin Silliman and other leading scientists.Post 1972; 1976a, p. 91-93. Charles Grafton Page's electromagnetic locomotive.Page, 1854, American Polytechnic Journal, 257 On April 29, 1851, Page boosted its motors from 8 to 20 HP power. Page conducted a full test, intending to run the 21,000 pound locomotive from Washington DC to Baltimore and back with passengers on board, but problems immediately arose. High voltage sparks, resulting from the effect Page had investigated with the spiral conductor, broke through the insulation of the electrical coils, resulting in short circuits. Many of the battery's fragile clay dividers cracked on starting up; others broke down during operation. Page and his mechanic Ari Davis struggled to make repairs and keep the locomotive running. With some periods of steady running, the nearly silent engine traveled to Bladensburg, Maryland, at a top speed of . Page reversed direction there, for what was an arduous, calamity-laced return to the National Capitol.Post 1972; 1976a, p. 96-99. The failures of Page's electromagnetic locomotive test run were cautionary to other inventors who eventually found other means than batteries to produce electrically driven locomotion. Before Page began his attempt, work such as that of James Prescott Joule had generated a general consensus among scientists that \\"the battery powered motor was a hopelessly impractical device\\".Post, 1976a, p. 83 Page had disregarded those findings. He himself never gave up believing in the practical potential of his design.Post 1972; 1976a, p. 99-103. Unmasking pseudoscience Comfortable himself in public performance as a popular lecturer and singer, being skilled in ventriloquism as well,Page, (1853a), p. 24. Page was astute in detecting the misuse of performative acts in defrauding a gullible public. One class of fraudulent schemes prevalent at the time involved communications with spirits by means of rapping sounds, the motion of a table, or other such signs produced in the vicinity of the perpetrator- medium. The sounds and motions were attributed to occult forces and forms of electricity. The Fox sisters, of Rochester New York, made these claims notorious by exhibiting in public and private settings, while collecting money from their audiences. Investigating some of these performers in person, Page produced a book that exposes various means of deception they employed (Page, 1853a). He described his analysis of these techniques during a sitting with the Fox sisters. Each time a critical observer peered under the table around which the sisters were seated, the spirit rapping ceased; whenever the observer sat upright, the sounds recommenced.Page, (1853a), p. 37. Page asked to have the spirit sounds displayed elsewhere than via the table. One sister climbed into a wardrobe closet. Page identified where her long dress (concealing a stick or other apparatus) contacted the wardrobe. Through his expert knowledge of ventriloquism, Page detected how this performer was misdirecting the viewer's attention away from the actual source of the sound while building expectations to suppose the sound came from elsewhere than the source. However the trick was \\"poorly done\\" and the girl could not control it so as to produce any spirit communication.Page, (1853a), p. 43-42. Going on to reveal other fraudulent practices, Page addressed the relationship at work between performer and audience by which both functioned as perpetrators: Page's efforts to expose these frauds at their human roots stems in part from his keen concern for furthering the public understanding of science and their proficient use of its findings and benefits.Post,(1976a), p. 131. In this undertaking, Page allied with contemporary Michael FaradayFaraday,1855, p.54. and other scientists throughout history who have sought to debunk the unscrupulous applications of pseudoscience upon a willing and gullible public. Controversy and impact from politics, war, and patents As with the challenge to spiritualism described above, Page's scientific undertakings brought him into public arenas where politics and controversy held sway. Eloquent, combative, keen-minded and persistent, Page made his commitments known. Increasingly, Page's self-chosen and sometimes self-serving commitments diverged from the norms of behavior sanctioned by society and the elitism of the emerging professionalist trend in science. The resulting tarnish to Page's reputation impacted him during his lifetime and contributed to the longstanding historical neglect of his scientific work and personal story, thereby reducing general understanding of the complexity of the American experience in science.Post, 1976a; Cavicchi, 2008 A tension early to arise in his career as patent examiner was that of the conflict of interest between the privileged information he had regarding applicants' patents, and his private consulting with particular inventors on the side. Following his appearance in the 1848 Morse v O'Reilly lawsuit over the telegraph, Page took a more careful stance in his role as patent examiner. Thereafter, he refrained from transmitting such privileged information to rival patent applicants.Post,(1976a), p. 72. However, the well-paid public post of patent examiner put the occupants continually under scrutiny by politicians, scientists, and aspiring inventors. Both Congress and the executive branch exerted control and influence over policy and practices in the patent office.Post, 1976a, p. 47. In the early years of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, a patent examiner was expected to be highly trained, knowledgeable in all the sciences, informed on current and past technology. Page was an exemplar of this ideal. As Page continued in the job, the number of patents submitted to the agency increased sharply, while the number of patents granted was the same or less, and the number of patent examiners was unchanged.Post, 1976a, p.55-59; Cooper, 1991, p. 32-38. Inventors seeking patents, becoming incensed about decisions made against them, coalesced into a lobby with a voice projected through the journal Scientific American. This lobby advocated \\"liberalization\\" ‚Äî more leniency in the granting of patents, giving the inventor the \\"benefit of the doubt\\"‚Äî and argued against the scientific research being sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution under Joseph Henry.Post, 1976a, p. 110-126. Henry took a hard line, decrying inventors' \\"futile attempts to innovate and improve\\".Post, 1976a, p. 129. The elite professionalized science that Henry was building up through the Smithsonian and other organizations treated as low status the having or seeking of a patent; patents were not considered a contribution to science. While Page set out to show that gaining patents was genuine scientific work, he fell out of favor with the scientific establishment. His friendship with Henry petered out, and Page was no longer held in high regard as part of elite science.Post, 1976a, p. 130-141 Page shifted in his position on the granting of patents. As an examiner of patents, he was scrupulous and fair. Through his own experience as an inventor and association with other inventors, he allied with their concerns. On his resignation from the patent agency, Page used the journal he founded and edited as a forum to critique and even lambast the agency and policies which he had upheld for 10 years prior. Following the example of Samuel Morse, who developed the telegraph to commercial viability through assistance from federal government funds, Page sought a similar level of support for his electromagnetically powered locomotive. He found a political ally in Thomas Hart Benton, senator from Missouri. Benton's passionate rhetoric on behalf of Page's vision was instrumental in securing unanimous support for a Senate allocation of $20,000 to fund Page's project through the Department of Navy.Post,(1976a), p. 84-87. By the end of that year (1849), Page reported to the Navy that he was collaborating on the project with a mechanic, Ari Davis, the brother of Daniel Davis Jr., but had nothing yet to show. In print, inventor Thomas Davenport (inventor) challenged the expenditure of public funds on Page's project, claiming that motors he had already invented and built were equal to the task. Page defused that objection by publishing a statement about his unique device.Post,1976a, p. 89-90; Schiffer, 2008, p. 155-174. More troubles ensued for the project. Running low on cash, Page asked for more. Speaking in the Senate in the summer of 1850, Benton presented Page's attainment of a force an order of magnitude greater than what the same battery had output under his initial trials. Benton upped the stakes by requesting funds for Page to develop an electromagnetically powered ship of war. This second petition met with serious opposition in the Senate. Senator Henry Stuart Foote countered that Page had not proved substantial progress or benefits from his work. Senator Jefferson Finis Davis objected to the appropriation of government funds to one inventor, while other inventors such as Thomas Davenport went unsupported. Both the US Senate and House nixed any further funds for Page's project. In order to prepare the locomotive for its 1851 trial run, Page went over $6000 into debt.Post, 1972; 1976a, p.94-97; Schiffer, 2008, p. 155-174. In the wake of the failed public test of this locomotive, Page faced a critical press. Gaining no assistance from the world of finance, he emerged from the debacle in \\"desperate straights, financially and emotionally\\".Post, 1976a, p. 100. The American Civil War wreaked a further devastating impact on Page's scientific work and legacy. In 1863, Union soldiers stationed in the area of Page's home, broke into his laboratory as a random, unprovoked act of violence. His equipment, inventions and laboratory notebooks were destroyed.Post, 1976a, p. 164 Some other inventions by Page which he had donated to the Smithsonian Institution were destroyed by a fire there in 1865.Post, 1976a, p. 69 As a result of these destructive events, very few of Page's handmade devices exist today.Pantalony et al, 2005, p. 157-159; Cavicchi, 2006. With little remaining of his experimental work and notes, Page's many contributions have slipped from the view of most historians. Suffering debt, terminal illness and isolation from the mainstream scientific community by his last years, Page contrived one final effort to secure credit and status for his achievements. In 1867, he petitioned the United States Congress for a retrospective patent on his inventions of the late 1830s: the spiral conductor, the circuit breakers, the double helical coil.Page, 1867a. The granting of such a patent transgressed such policies as that an invention in widespread public use for decades can not be patented, and that an employee of the Patent office can not hold a patent. Page circumvented these policies by appealing to nationalism. To support his argument, he published anonymously a lengthy, closely researched yet self-promoting book titled The American Claim to the Induction Coil and its electrostatic Developments (1867b).Page, 1867; Post, 1976b, p. 12821-1283. By the 1860s, the induction coil was becoming a prominent instrument of physics research. Instrument-makers in America, Great Britain and the European continent contributed in developing the construction and operation of induction coils.Cavicchi, 1999; 2006 Premiere among these instrument makers was Heinrich Daniel Ruhmkorff, who in 1864 received from Emperor Napoleon III the prestigious Volta Prize along with a 50,000 franc award for his 'invention' of the induction coil. Page maintained that the devices he developed in the 1830s were not markedly different from the induction coil and that other American inventors had filled in with improvements that were better than anything made by Ruhmkorff ‚Äî and alleging that Ruhmkorff had plagiarized the coil of another American instrument-maker, Edward Samuel Ritchie.(Page), 1867b; Post, 1976b, 1283. A special act passed by the U.S. House and Senate, and signed by President Andrew Johnson authorized what was later dubbed \\"The Page Patent\\". Page died a few weeks later, in May 1868. Instead of dying with him, the Page patent went on to play a major role in the politics and economics of the telegraph industry. Page's lawyer and heirs successfully argued that the patent covered the mechanisms involved in \\"all known forms of telegraphy\\".Post, 1976b, p. 1284. An interest in the patent was sold to the Western Union Co; together Western Union and the Page heirs reaped lucrative benefits. Page's patent secured a life 'in style' for his widow and heirs. Although he was no longer living, it figured as yet another violation, on his part, of the behavior code under the emerging professionalization of science of the day, under which science was to be conducted for its own sake, without accruing apparent political or financial gain.Post, 1976b, p. 1285-1286.

As per inscriptions in the temple, the temple was built by king of Chera dynasty Legend 250px There is a song-poem(Poombarai Velan) by Aruna giri nathar who lived during the 15th century. It was this Murugan who has saved Arunagiri nathar from a devil by taking the form of a child (Kulanthai). Hence the main deity of this temple is called ‚ÄòKuzhanthai Velappar‚Äô History The idol of the Muruga in Poombarai, was created and consecrated by sage Bogar, one of aaseevaham's (Ancient Tamil Culture) eighteen great siddhas out of an amalgam of nine poisons or navapashanam. The legend also holds that, the sculptor had to work very rapidly to complete its features, but that he spent so much time in creating the face, he did not have time to bestow but a rough grace upon the rest of the body, thus explaining the contrast between the artistic perfection of the face and the slightly less accomplished work upon the body. A shrine to Bhogar exists in the southwestern corridor of the temple, which, by legend, is said to be connected by a tunnel to a cave in the heart of the hill, where Bhogar continues to meditate and maintain his vigil, with eight idols of Muruga. The deity, after centuries of worship, fell into neglect and was suffered to be engulfed by the forest. One night, Perumal a king of the Chera Dynastys, who controlled the area between the second and fifth centuries A.D., wandered from his hunting party and was forced to take refuge at the foot of the hill. It so befell, that the Murugan, appeared to him in a dream, and ordered him to restore the idol to its former state. The king commenced a search for the idol, and finding it, constructed the temple that now houses it, and re-instituted its worship. Architecture The idol of the deity is said to be made of an amalgam of nine poisonous substances which forms an eternal medicine when mixed in a certain ratio. It is placed upon a pedestal of stone, with an archway framing it and represents the god Kuzhanthai Velappar in the form he assumed at Poombarai - that of a very young recluse, shorn of his locks and all his finery. The temple is built in a typical South India temple architectural style. There is no tower. The sanctum sanctorum faces towards the east direction. The main idol, Kulandai Velappan is present in the standing posture in the sanctum sanctorum. His mount (vahanam) peacock is found near the Bali peetham and flag staff facing towards the main shrine. There is a sub-shrine where the metal Utsava idols of Ganesha and Subramanya with his consorts are placed. It is found near the sanctum sanctorum. The wall around the main shrine has Nataraja and Dattatreya as the Koshta idols. It is very rare to find Nataraja and Dattatreya in the form of carvings as the Koshta idols. Moreover, it is also rare to find the carving or idol of Dattatreya. The temple also houses many sub-shrines of various deities such as Shiva Linga, Ganesha, Navagraha, Bhairava, Idumban, Dakshinamurti and Nagas. The sanctum of the temple is of early Chera architecture Religious practices One of the main traditions of the temple, is the tonsuring of devotees, who vow to discard their hair in imitation of the Lord of Poombarai. Another is the anointing of the head of the presiding deity's idol with sandalwood paste, at night, prior to the temple being closed for the day. The paste, upon being allowed to stay overnight, is said to acquire medicinal properties, and is much sought after and distributed to devotees, as rakkƒÅla chanda·πáam. Festivals and religious practises Every year Poombarai celebrates Ther Thiruvizha (car festival) for Lord Muruga. It falls on Kettai nakshatra which comes after Thai Poosam. Normally it comes in Thai or Maasi month. Religious importance There is a song-poem(Poombarai Velan) by Aruna giri nathar who lived during the 15th century while visited this temple this god has saved Arunagiri nathar from one devil by acted as a Baby(Kulanthai), The peoples is trusting because of this incident only Poombarai Murugan has called as Kuzhanthai Velappar Also some of others trusting this idol is made up of Dasaphasanam which is Ten different herbals. And this abhishegam cures more diseases like cancer and sugar etc. By scientifically more 'Siddhar' lived around western-gates so this Temple location also Middle of western-gates only so we can confirm the stories of Bhogar idols Notes References * * External links *Official website of Arulmigu Dandayudhapani Swami Devasthanam, Palani *Temple legends Category:Hindu temples in Dindigul district Category:Murugan temples in Tamil Nadu Category:Kaumaram ","title":"Kuzhanthai Velappar Temple (Poombarai, Kodaikanal Murugan Temple)"},{"id":"20294878","text":"Avraham \\"Avi\\" Yehezkel (, born 10 June 1958) is a former Israeli politician who served as a member of the Knesset for the Labor Party between 1992 and 2003, and again briefly in 2006.

Synopsis Thirteen- year-old Jiro finds himself caught up in the political events of late eighteenth century Osaka, Japan when he accompanies his father, Hanji, to deliver a puppet to the Hanaza theater. Yoshida, the owner and master puppeteer, offers to take the boy on as an apprentice. To Jiro‚Äôs chagrin, his mother, Isako, does not take Yoshida‚Äôs offer seriously. Determined not to be a burden on his family during the current famine, Jiro runs away to the theater, where he becomes an apprentice. He begins his career by opening curtains and memorizing scripts and eventually graduates to a role as a ‚Äúfoot operator.‚Äù Along the way, he is helped by an older boy, Yoshida‚Äôs son, Kinshi, who does not seem able to please his father. Worried about his father, who is said to be ill, Jiro briefly returns home to discover that Isako has taken his father to recuperate at a relative‚Äôs farm in Kyoto. When Jiro again returns home on New Year‚Äôs Day, he discovers that his mother is near starvation, and when he returns to the Hanaza he realizes he forgot to pray. One evening, Saburo, the mysterious bandit who steals from the rich to help the poor, leaves a notice on the door of the theater demanding a special performance of the current play, ‚ÄúThe Thief of the Tokaido.‚Äù Jiro later finds the sword that Saburo used for the performance day special in the second floor of the storage room, a shed-like room with walls lined with puppets which is off limits. He asks Okada for advice on whether to give the sword to Kinshi as an opportunity to talk to Saburo, who was believed to be Yoshida. Okada later tells Jiro that he is Saburo. Isako and Okada eventually agree to exchange the boys - Jiro to remain with Okada and the theatre, while Kinshi will stay with Isako on the farm - and live a happy life.

Trait versus state  Generally, work engagement is conceptualized as a relatively stable phenomenon. This can be explained by the presence of specific job and organizational characteristics.Macey, W.H., & Schneider, B. (2008). The meaning of employee engagement.

Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 15(3), 209‚Äì222. https://doi.org/10.1037/a0019408 is an alternative instrument for the assessment of work engagement. It consists of two dimensions: exhaustion-vigor and cynicism-dedication.Sinval, J., Queir√≥s, C., Pasian, S. R., & Mar√¥co, J. (2019). Transcultural adaptation of the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI) for Brazil and Portugal. Frontiers in Psychology, 10, 1‚Äì28. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00338 The recently operationalized construct of drive was proposed as the key differentiating individual difference dimension of work engagement and has shown promising psychometric results. Measured on the basis of 13 facets and three aspects (passion, effort, ideation), drive is argued to predict future motivation and engagement levels better than measuring these attributes directly at any point in time, in any given context.  Main drivers  Research has identified two key sets of variables that drive work engagement: *Job resources: Work engagement is found to be positively associated with job resources such as social support from co-workers and from one's superior, performance feedback, coaching, job control, task variety, opportunities for learning and development, and training facilities. These resources are helpful in reducing the impact of job demands on strain, but they are also useful in the achievement of work goals, and they stimulate learning, personal growth and development. One consistent finding is that the motivational potential of job resources is particularly salient in the face of high job demands.Bakker, A.B. & Demerouti, E. (2008). Towards a model of work engagement. Career Development International, 13, 209-223 :Example: In a longitudinal study among 2555 Finnish dentists, researchers found that job resources lead to work engagement, which in turn had an influence on the level of personal initiative and consequently on work- unit innovativeness.Hakanen, J.J., Perhoniemia, R., and Toppinen-Tannera (2008). Positive gain spirals at work: From job resources to work engagement, personal initiative and work-unit innovativeness. Journal of Vocational Behavior, 73, 1, 78-91 :Example: In a study that aimed to examine job resources, work engagement and Finnish dairy farmers‚Äô preferences concerning methods to enhance overall well-being while working on farms. The results indicate that the family, working with cattle, healthy farm animals, a reasonable workload, and a sustainable farm economy have the capacity to create positive impacts on well-being among dairy farmers. Well-being on farms is a part of sustainable food production. *Personal resources: personal resources, such as optimism, self-efficacy and resilience are functional in controlling the environment and exerting impact on it in a successful way. Furthermore, engaged employees have several personal characteristics that differentiate them from less engaged employees. Five factor model is useful for examining the dispositional source of work engagement. As a higher order factor work engagement was related to big five factors. Examples are extraversion, conscientiousness and emotional stability. Psychological capital also seems to be related to work engagement. :Example: Xanthopoulou, Bakker, Demerouti, and Schaufeli (2007) studied Dutch technicians' work engagement in relation to three personal resources (self-efficacy, organizational-based self-esteem, and optimism).Xanthopoulou, D., Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E., & Schaufeli, W.B. (2007). The role of personal resources in the job demands- resources model. International Journal of Stress Management, 14, 121-141 Results indicated that these resources were related to work engagement. For an overall model of work engagement, see Bakker & Demerouti (2008). The work motivation model includes 5 elements of individual motivators: money, myself, membership of a team, mastery, and mission. The approach is similar to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.  Performance  Engagement is related to better performance. For instance, engaged contact workers from hotels and restaurants produce better service quality as perceived by their customers;Salanova, M., Agut, S., & Peir√≥, J.M. (2005). Linking organizational resources and Work engagement to employee performance and customer loyalty: The mediating role of service climate. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90, 1217-1227 the more engaged university students feel the higher their next year's Grade Point Average;Salanova, M., Bres√≥, E. & Schaufeli, W.B. (2005).

(2008). Working in the sky: A dairy study among flight attendants. Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 13, 345-356 and the more engaged restaurant workers, the higher the financial turnover of the shift.Xanthopoulou, D., Bakker, A.B., Demerouti, E. & Schaufeli, W.B.

Work engagement as a mediator between employee attitudes and outcomes. International Journal of Human Resource Management, 24, 2799-2823. Salanova, Agut and Peir√≥ (2005) found a positive relationship between organization resources, work engagement and performance among employees, working in Spanish restaurants and hotels.Salanova, M., Agut, S. & Peri√≥, J.M. (2005). Linking organizational resources and work engagement to employee performance and customer loyalty: The mediation of service climeate. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90, 1217-1227. There are several possible reasons why engaged employees show higher performance than non-engaged employees:Bakker, A.B. (2009). Building engagement in the workplace. In R. J. Burke & C.L. Cooper (Eds.), The peak performing organization (pp. 50-72). Oxon, UK: Routledge * They often experience positive emotions; * They experience better health; * They create their own job and personal resources; * They transfer their engagement to others (cross-over).  Downside  There is also a possibility of becoming 'over-engaged'. For example, it can distort the work-life balance when employees take work home.Geurts, S.A.E., & Demerouti, E. (2003).

Background Bred by Leslie Combs II, Triple Bend was sold at the 1969 Keeneland summer yearling sales for $100,000 to Vancouver industrialist Frank McMahon, the owner of Majestic Prince who won that year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. Unfortunately, soon after McMahon purchased Triple Bend, while on a farm he became caught in a fence and his struggles left him partially paralyzed and his euthanasia became a possibility. Nursed back to health, Triple Bend raced once as a juvenile in 1970. Racing career Under trainer Vance Longden, in 1971 his best results races was a win in the Contra Costa Stakes plus four second-place finishes in other stakes races. A rapidly improving horse at age four, in 1972 Triple Bend ran second to Unconscious in the Strub Stakes then beat him in winning California's richest and most prestigious race, the Santa Anita Handicap.http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1085903/index.htm Sports Illustrated article on Triple Bend winning the 1972 Santa Anita Handicap Triple Bend dead heated with Autobiography for first in the San Fernando Stakes and in winning the Los Angeles Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack, set a world record time of 119.80 for seven furlongs.

The company was established in the Rhondda in 1897 and has six department stores in South Wales, South West England and the Midlands. The company also owns the Vale Resort in the Vale of Glamorgan and the adjacent Hensol Castle, a conference and wedding venue. History James Henry Leeke established Leekes as a blacksmith in Tonypandy in the Rhondda Valley, Wales in 1897. He operated a smithy for sharpening tools at the rear of the family home, a small terraced house in Clydach Vale, and then opened a small ironmongery business in the front room. The Leekes business survived the following two decades intact and James' son Llewellyn took over the business from his father in 1933 at the age of 22. In 1948 Llewellyn bought a larger shop in Dunraven Street, Tonypandy; at this time the ironmonger and builders merchant was operated almost entirely by the family. In the late 1960s, Llewellyn‚Äôs son Gerald joined the business full-time, extended the range at Dunraven Street and added kitchen and bathrooms displays, taking over the shop next door for an additional showroom. In 1965 the company turnover had reached ¬£38,000 and the former goods station in Trealaw, Rhondda was acquired for expansion, combining the retail premises and builders yard with some car parking. Leekes bought another Rhondda site in Talbot Green near Llantrisant and opened a store in 1977, described as a \\"DIY superstore\\". In 2007 the eldest son of Llewellyn, David Leeke, wrote an account of the development of the Welsh business from the boom in the coal industry, through the Depression and two World Wars to the 21st century.Leeke, David (2007). An Iron Monger's Tale. Llandysul: Gomer Press. . In 2009 Leekes bought out Midlands-based Cole's Home Furnishing, adding three stores in England: at Bilston near Wolverhampton, Bedworth near Coventry, and Fenton in Stoke-on-Trent. The Coventry store was sold in 2018. Leekes bought Park Furnishers (Bristol) Limited in 2016, a family-run business with a furniture store in Bedminster, Bristol. Operations Leekes remains a family business with many family members from the fourth generation. There are department stores in Wales at Cross Hands and Llantrisant, and a builders' merchant at Tonypandy. Stores in England are at Bilston, Hereford and Melksham (Wiltshire), together with showrooms for conservatories and windows at Thornbury (Gloucestershire) and Swindon. In addition, the Park Furnishers store in Bedminster continues to trade under its own name. Each Leekes department store is divided into the following departments: Cabinet Furniture, Upholstery, Bedroom Furniture, Kitchen Furniture, Sound and Vision, Kitchen Appliances, Kitchen and Tableware, Home Accessories, Gifts, Fitted Bathrooms, Bathroom Accessories, Fitted Kitchens, Conservatories, Interior Design Studio, Fire Studio, Fitness Equipment & Leisure, DIY, Garden Living, Building Centre, Fitted Carpets, Decorating and Home Textiles. Structure The business was restructured in 2005 as a group of companies. Each of the trading companies, including the retailer Leekes Limited, is a wholly owned subsidiary of J.H. Leeke and Sons Limited. The Vale Resort In 1994, Leekes Retail and Leisure Group took ownership of a golf club in Hensol in the Vale of Glamorgan. This marked the start of diversification of the business into the leisure industry. The company then built and developed The Vale Resort, trading since 1999 as Vale of Glamorgan Hotel Limited. The site has a four-star hotel, a leisure club, Wales' largest spa and two championship golf courses set in over of parkland. Hensol Castle In 2003, the company purchased the Hensol Castle estate that adjoins the Vale resort.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/3142182.stm The estate includes a 17th-century stately home, an historically important mid-18th century landscaped park, a lake and serpentine pond.

Naturalism is a movement in European drama and theatre that developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It refers to theatre that attempts to create an illusion of reality through a range of dramatic and theatrical strategies. Interest in naturalism especially flourished with the French playwrights of the time, but the most successful example is Strindberg's play Miss Julie, which was written with the intention to abide by both his own particular version of naturalism, and also the version described by the French novelist and literary theoretician, √âmile Zola.Madsen, Borge Gedso. Strindberg‚Äôs Naturalistic Theatre. Russell & Russell.1962. Zola's term for naturalism is la nouvelle formule. The three primary principles of naturalism (faire vrai, faire grand and faire simple) are first, that the play should be realistic, and the result of a careful study of human behaviour and psychology. The characters should be flesh and blood; their motivations and actions should be grounded in their heredity and environment. The presentation of a naturalistic play, in terms of the setting and performances, should be realistic and not flamboyant or theatrical. The single setting of Miss Julie, for example, is a kitchen. Second, the conflicts in the play should be issues of meaningful, life-altering significance ‚Äî not small or petty. And third, the play should be simple ‚Äî not cluttered with complicated sub-plots or lengthy expositions.Madsen, Borge Gedso. Strindberg‚Äôs Naturalistic Theatre. Russell & Russell.1962. Darwinian understandings pervade naturalistic plays, especially in the determining role of the environment on character, and as motivation for behavior. Naturalism emphasizes everyday speech forms, plausibility in the writing, (no ghosts, spirits or gods intervening in the human action), a choice of subjects that are contemporary and reasonable (no exotic, otherworldly or fantastic locales, nor historical or mythic time-periods); an extension of the social range of characters portrayed (not only the aristocrats of classical drama, to include bourgeois and working-class protagonists) and social conflicts; and a style of acting that attempts to recreate the impression of reality. Naturalism was first advocated explicitly by √âmile Zola in his 1880 essay entitled Naturalism on the Stage.  Influences  Naturalistic writers were influenced by the theory of evolution of Charles Darwin.Williams (1976, 217). They believed that one's heredity and social environment determine one's character. Whereas realism seeks only to describe subjects as they really are, naturalism also attempts to determine \\"scientifically\\" the underlying forces (i.e. the environment or heredity) influencing the actions of its subjects. Naturalistic works are opposed to romanticism, in which subjects may receive highly symbolic, idealistic, or even supernatural treatment. They often include uncouth or sordid subject matter; for example, √âmile Zola's works had a frankness about sexuality along with a pervasive pessimism. Naturalistic works exposed the dark harshness of life, including poverty, racism, sex, prejudice, disease, prostitution, and filth. As a result, Naturalistic writers were frequently criticized for being too blunt.

Ungar for studying hyperbolic geometry in analogy to the way vector spaces are used in Euclidean geometry.Abraham A. Ungar (2005), \\"Analytic Hyperbolic Geometry: Mathematical Foundations and Applications\\", Published by World Scientific, , Ungar introduced the concept of gyrovectors that have addition based on gyrogroups instead of vectors which have addition based on groups. Ungar developed his concept as a tool for the formulation of special relativity as an alternative to the use of Lorentz transformations to represent compositions of velocities (also called boosts - \\"boosts\\" are aspects of relative velocities, and should not be conflated with \\"translations\\"). This is achieved by introducing \\"gyro operators\\"; two 3d velocity vectors are used to construct an operator, which acts on another 3d velocity.  Name  Gyrogroups are weakly associative grouplike structures. Ungar proposed the term gyrogroup for what he called a gyrocommutative-gyrogroup, with the term gyrogroup being reserved for the non-gyrocommutative case, in analogy with groups vs. abelian groups. Gyrogroups are a type of Bol loop. Gyrocommutative gyrogroups are equivalent to K-loopsHubert Kiechle (2002), \\"Theory of K-loops\\",Published by Springer,, although defined differently. The terms Bruck loopLarissa Sbitneva (2001), Nonassociative Geometry of Special Relativity, International Journal of Theoretical Physics, Springer, Vol.40, No.1 / Jan 2001 and dyadic symsetJ lawson Y Lim (2004), Means on dyadic symmetrie sets and polar decompositions, Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universit√§t Hamburg, Springer, Vol.74, No.1 / Dec 2004 are also in use. Mathematics of gyrovector spaces Gyrogroups =Axioms= A groupoid (G, \\\\oplus) is a gyrogroup if its binary operation satisfies the following axioms: #In G there is at least one element 0 called a left identity with 0\\\\oplusa = a for all a ‚àà G. #For each a ‚àà G there is an element \\\\ominusa in G called a left inverse of a with \\\\ominusa\\\\oplusa = 0. #For any a, b, c in G there exists a unique element gyr[a, b]c in G such that the binary operation obeys the left gyroassociative law: a\\\\oplus(b\\\\oplusc) = (a\\\\oplusb)\\\\oplusgyr[a, b]c #The map gyr[a, b]:G ‚Üí G given by c ‚Üí gyr[a, b]c is an automorphism of the groupoid (G, \\\\oplus). That is gyr[a, b] is a member of Aut(G, \\\\oplus) and the automorphism gyr[a, b] of G is called the gyroautomorphism of G generated by a, b in G. The operation gyr:G √ó G ‚Üí Aut(G, \\\\oplus) is called the gyrator of G. #The gyroautomorphism gyr[a, b] has the left loop property gyr[a, b] = gyr[a\\\\oplusb, b] The first pair of axioms are like the group axioms. The last pair present the gyrator axioms and the middle axiom links the two pairs. Since a gyrogroup has inverses and an identity it qualifies as a quasigroup and a loop. Gyrogroups are a generalization of groups. Every group is an example of a gyrogroup with gyr defined as the identity map. An example of a finite gyrogroup is given in. =Identities= Some identities which hold in any gyrogroup (G,\\\\oplus): #\\\\mathrm{gyr}[\\\\mathbf{u},\\\\mathbf{v}]\\\\mathbf{w}=\\\\ominus(\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\oplus (\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\oplus (\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{w})) (gyration) #\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\oplus (\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{w}) = (\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{v})\\\\oplus \\\\mathrm{gyr}[\\\\mathbf{u},\\\\mathbf{v}]\\\\mathbf{w} (left associativity) #(\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{v}) \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{w} = \\\\mathbf{u} \\\\oplus (\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\oplus \\\\mathrm{gyr}[\\\\mathbf{v},\\\\mathbf{u}]\\\\mathbf{w}) (right associativity) More identities given on page 50 of Analytic hyperbolic geometry and Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity, Abraham A. Ungar, World Scientific, 2008, . =Gyrocommutativity= A gyrogroup (G,\\\\oplus) is gyrocommutative if its binary operation obeys the gyrocommutative law: a \\\\oplus b = gyr[a, b](b \\\\oplus a). For relativistic velocity addition, this formula showing the role of rotation relating a+b and b+a was published in 1914 by Ludwik SilbersteinLudwik Silberstein, The theory of relativity, Macmillan, 1914Page 214, Chapter 5, Symplectic matrices: first order systems and special relativity, Mark Kauderer, World Scientific, 1994, =Coaddition= In every gyrogroup, a second operation can be defined called coaddition: a\\\\boxplus b = a\\\\oplus gyr[a,\\\\ominusb]b for all a, b ‚àà G. Coaddition is commutative if the gyrogroup addition is gyrocommutative. Beltrami‚ÄìKlein disc/ball model and Einstein addition Relativistic velocities can be considered as points in the Beltrami‚ÄìKlein model of hyperbolic geometry and so vector addition in the Beltrami‚ÄìKlein model can be given by the velocity addition formula. In order for the formula to generalize to vector addition in hyperbolic space of dimensions greater than 3, the formula must be written in a form that avoids use of the cross product in favour of the dot product. In the general case, the Einstein velocity addition of two velocities \\\\mathbf{u} and \\\\mathbf{v} is given in coordinate-independent form as: :\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\oplus_E \\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v}}{c^2}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{u}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma_\\\\mathbf{u}}\\\\mathbf{v}+\\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_\\\\mathbf{u}}{1+\\\\gamma_\\\\mathbf{u}}(\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v})\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} where \\\\gamma_\\\\mathbf{u} is the gamma factor given by the equation \\\\gamma_\\\\mathbf{u}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{u}^2}{c^2}}}. Using coordinates this becomes: :\\\\begin{pmatrix}w_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ w_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ w_3\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}=\\\\frac{1}{1+\\\\frac{u_1v_1+u_2v_2+u_3v_3}{c^2}}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left[1+\\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_\\\\mathbf{u}}{1+\\\\gamma_\\\\mathbf{u}}(u_1v_1+u_2v_2+u_3v_3)\\\\right]\\\\begin{pmatrix}u_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ u_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ u_3\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma_\\\\mathbf{u}}\\\\begin{pmatrix}v_1\\\\\\\\\\\\ v_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ v_3\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} where \\\\gamma_\\\\mathbf{u}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{u_1^2+u_2^2+u_3^2}{c^2}}}. Einstein velocity addition is commutative and associative only when \\\\mathbf{u} and \\\\mathbf{v} are parallel.

Thomas precession has an interpretation in hyperbolic geometry as the negative hyperbolic triangle defect. =Lorentz transformation composition= If the 3 √ó 3 matrix form of the rotation applied to 3-coordinates is given by gyr[u,v], then the 4 √ó 4 matrix rotation applied to 4-coordinates is given by: : \\\\mathrm{Gyr}[\\\\mathbf{u},\\\\mathbf{v}]= \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\mathrm{gyr}[\\\\mathbf{u},\\\\mathbf{v}] \\\\end{pmatrix} . The composition of two Lorentz boosts B(u) and B(v) of velocities u and v is given by:Ungar, A. A: The relativistic velocity composition paradox and the Thomas rotation. Found. Phys. 19, 1385‚Äì1396 (1989) :B(\\\\mathbf{u})B(\\\\mathbf{v})=B(\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\oplus\\\\mathbf{v})\\\\mathrm{Gyr}[\\\\mathbf{u},\\\\mathbf{v}]=\\\\mathrm{Gyr}[\\\\mathbf{u},\\\\mathbf{v}]B(\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\oplus\\\\mathbf{u}) This fact that either B(u\\\\oplusv) or B(v\\\\oplusu) can be used depending whether you write the rotation before or after explains the velocity composition paradox. The composition of two Lorentz transformations L(u,U) and L(v,V) which include rotations U and V is given by:eq. (55), Thomas rotation and the parametrization of the Lorentz transformation group, AA Ungar ‚Äì Foundations of Physics Letters, 1988 :L(\\\\mathbf{u},U)L(\\\\mathbf{v},V)=L(\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\oplus U\\\\mathbf{v}, \\\\mathrm{gyr}[\\\\mathbf{u},U\\\\mathbf{v}]UV) In the above, a boost can be represented as a 4 √ó 4 matrix. The boost matrix B(v) means the boost B that uses the components of v, i.e. v1, v2, v3 in the entries of the matrix, or rather the components of v/c in the representation that is used in the section Lorentz transformation#Matrix forms. The matrix entries depend on the components of the 3-velocity v, and that's what the notation B(v) means. It could be argued that the entries depend on the components of the 4-velocity because 3 of the entries of the 4-velocity are the same as the entries of the 3-velocity, but the usefulness of parameterizing the boost by 3-velocity is that the resultant boost you get from the composition of two boosts uses the components of the 3-velocity composition u\\\\oplusv in the 4 √ó 4 matrix B(u\\\\oplusv). But the resultant boost also needs to be multiplied by a rotation matrix because boost composition (i.e. the multiplication of two 4 √ó 4 matrices) results not in a pure boost but a boost and a rotation, i.e. a 4 √ó 4 matrix that corresponds to the rotation Gyr[u,v] to get B(u)B(v) = B(u\\\\oplusv)Gyr[u,v] = Gyr[u,v]B(v\\\\oplusu). =Einstein gyrovector spaces= Let s be any positive constant, let (V,+,.) be any real inner product space and let Vs={v ‚àà V :vs, \\\\oplus, \\\\otimes) is an Einstein gyrogroup (Vs, \\\\oplus) with scalar multiplication given by r\\\\otimesv = s tanh(r tanh‚àí1(v/s))v/v where r is any real number, v ‚àà Vs, v ‚â† 0 and r \\\\otimes 0 = 0 with the notation v \\\\otimes r = r \\\\otimes v. Einstein scalar multiplication does not distribute over Einstein addition except when the gyrovectors are colinear (monodistributivity), but it has other properties of vector spaces: For any positive integer n and for all real numbers r,r1,r2 and v ‚àà Vs': {  -  n \\\\otimes v = v \\\\oplus ... \\\\oplus v  n terms'' -  (r1 + r2) \\\\otimes v = r1 \\\\otimes v \\\\oplus r2 \\\\otimes v  Scalar distributive law -  (r1r2) \\\\otimes v = r1 \\\\otimes (r2 \\\\otimes v)  Scalar associative law -  r \\\\otimes(r1 \\\\otimes a \\\\oplus r2 \\\\otimes a) = r \\\\otimes(r1 \\\\otimes a) \\\\oplus r \\\\otimes(r2 \\\\otimes a)  Monodistributive law } Poincar√© disc/ball model and M√∂bius addition The M√∂bius transformation of the open unit disc in the complex plane is given by the polar decomposition :z\\\\to {e^{i\\\\theta}}{\\\\frac{a+z}{1+a\\\\bar{z}}} which can be written as e^{i\\\\theta} {(a\\\\oplus_M {z})} which defines the M√∂bius addition {a\\\\oplus_M {z}}= \\\\frac{a+z}{1+a\\\\bar{z}}. To generalize this to higher dimensions the complex numbers are considered as vectors in the plane \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathrm{R}}^2, and M√∂bius addition is rewritten in vector form as: :\\\\mathbf{u} \\\\oplus_M \\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\frac{(1+\\\\frac{2}{s^2}\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v}+\\\\frac{1}{s^2}\\\\mathbf{v}^2)\\\\mathbf{u}+(1-\\\\frac{1}{s^2}\\\\mathbf{u}^2)\\\\mathbf{v}}{1+\\\\frac{2}{s^2}\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{v}+\\\\frac{1}{s^4}\\\\mathbf{u}^2\\\\mathbf{v}^2} This gives the vector addition of points in the Poincar√© ball model of hyperbolic geometry where s=1 for the complex unit disc now becomes any s>0. M√∂bius gyrovector spaces Let s be any positive constant, let (V,+,.) be any real inner product space and let Vs={v ‚àà V :vs, \\\\oplus, \\\\otimes) is a M√∂bius gyrogroup (Vs, \\\\oplus) with scalar multiplication given by r \\\\otimesv = s tanh(r tanh‚àí1(v/s))v/v where r is any real number, v ‚àà Vs, v ‚â† 0 and r \\\\otimes 0 = 0 with the notation v \\\\otimes r = r \\\\otimes v. M√∂bius scalar multiplication coincides with Einstein scalar multiplication (see section above) and this stems from M√∂bius addition and Einstein addition coinciding for vectors that are parallel. Proper velocity space model and proper velocity addition A proper velocity space model of hyperbolic geometry is given by proper velocities with vector addition given by the proper velocity addition formula:Thomas Precession: Its Underlying Gyrogroup Axioms and Their Use in Hyperbolic Geometry and Relativistic Physics, Abraham A.

This formula provides a model that uses a whole space compared to other models of hyperbolic geometry which use discs or half-planes. A proper velocity gyrovector space is a real inner product space V, with the proper velocity gyrogroup addition \\\\oplus_U and with scalar multiplication defined by r \\\\otimesv = s sinh(r sinh‚àí1(v/s))v/v where r is any real number, v ‚àà V, v ‚â† 0 and r \\\\otimes 0 = 0 with the notation v \\\\otimes r = r \\\\otimes v. Isomorphisms A gyrovector space isomorphism preserves gyrogroup addition and scalar multiplication and the inner product. The three gyrovector spaces M√∂bius, Einstein and Proper Velocity are isomorphic. If M, E and U are M√∂bius, Einstein and Proper Velocity gyrovector spaces respectively with elements vm, ve and vu then the isomorphisms are given by: {   E\\\\rightarrowU by \\\\gamma_{\\\\mathbf{v}_e} \\\\mathbf{v}_e -  U\\\\rightarrowE by \\\\beta_{\\\\mathbf{v}_u} \\\\mathbf{v}_u -  E\\\\rightarrowM by \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\otimes_E \\\\mathbf{v}_e -  M\\\\rightarrowE by 2 \\\\otimes_M \\\\mathbf{v}_m -  M\\\\rightarrowU by 2 {{{\\\\gamma}^{2}}_{\\\\mathbf{v}_m}} \\\\mathbf{v}_m -  U\\\\rightarrowM by \\\\frac{\\\\beta_{\\\\mathbf{v}_u}}{1+\\\\beta_{\\\\mathbf{v}_u}}\\\\mathbf{v}_u } From this table the relation between \\\\oplus_E and \\\\oplus_M is given by the equations: \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\oplus_E\\\\mathbf{v}=2\\\\otimes\\\\left({\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\oplus_M\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{v}}\\\\right) \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\oplus_M\\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\otimes\\\\left({2\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\oplus_E 2\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{v}}\\\\right) This is related to the connection between M√∂bius transformations and Lorentz transformations. Gyrotrigonometry Gyrotrigonometry is the use of gyroconcepts to study hyperbolic triangles. Hyperbolic trigonometry as usually studied uses the hyperbolic functions cosh, sinh etc., and this contrasts with spherical trigonometry which uses the Euclidean trigonometric functions cos, sin, but with spherical triangle identities instead of ordinary plane triangle identities. Gyrotrigonometry takes the approach of using the ordinary trigonometric functions but in conjunction with gyrotriangle identities. =Triangle centers= The study of triangle centers traditionally is concerned with Euclidean geometry, but triangle centers can also be studied in hyperbolic geometry. Using gyrotrigonometry, expressions for trigonometric barycentric coordinates can be calculated that have the same form for both euclidean and hyperbolic geometry. In order for the expressions to coincide, the expressions must not encapsulate the specification of the anglesum being 180 degrees.Hyperbolic Barycentric Coordinates, Abraham A.

This is the coaddition to the gyrogroup operation. Gyroparallelogram addition is commutative. The gyroparallelogram law is similar to the parallelogram law in that a gyroparallelogram is a hyperbolic quadrilateral the two gyrodiagonals of which intersect at their gyromidpoints, just as a parallelogram is a Euclidean quadrilateral the two diagonals of which intersect at their midpoints.Abraham A.

The minimally invasive endodontic techniques of vital pulp therapy (VPT) are based on improved understanding of the capacity of pulp (nerve) tissues to heal and regenerate plus the availability of advanced endodontic materials. During the caries removal, this results in a carious or mechanical pulp exposure (bleeding) from the cavity. During pulpotomy, the inflamed/diseased pulp tissue is removed from the coronal pulp chamber of the tooth leaving healthy pulp tissue which is dressed with a long-term clinically-successful medicament that maintains the survival of the pulp and promotes repair. There are various types of medicament placed above the vital pulp such as Buckley‚Äôs Solution of formocresol, ferric sulfate, calcium hydroxide or MTA. MTA is a more recent material used for pulpotomies with a high rate of success, better than formocresol or ferric sulfate. It is also recommended to be the preferred pulpotomy agent in the future. After the coronal pulp chamber is filled, the tooth is restored with a filling material that seals the tooth from microleakage, such as a stainless steel crown which is the most effective long-term restoration. However, if there is sufficient remaining supporting tooth structure, other filling materials such as amalgam or composite resin can provide a functional alternative when the primary tooth has a life span of two years or less. The medium- to long-term treatment outcomes of pulpotomy in symptomatic permanent teeth with caries, especially in young people, indicate that pulpotomy can be a potential alternative to root canal therapy (RCT). Diagram of pulpotomy.There is another term, which is also related to vital pulp therapy, which is apexogenesis. Apexogenesis is a treatment in preserving vital pulp tissue in the apical part of a root canal to allow the completion in formation of the root apex. This clinical procedure is essentially a deep pulpotomy, aimed to preserve the pulp in immature teeth that have deep pulpal inflammation. Examples include teeth with carious exposures and trauma in which treatment of the exposed pulp is delayed and it becomes necessary to extend farther into the canal to reach healthy tissue.  Objectives   In primary tooth  After the pulpotomy treatment, the radicular pulp should remain asymptomatic without any adverse clinical signs or symptoms such as sensitivity, pain, or swelling. From the radiographs, there should be absence of postoperative evidence of pathologic root resorption. There should be absence of clinical signs of infection and inflammation and no harm to the succedaneous tooth. However, radiographs play a very important role, to check if pulpotomy can be done on the primary tooth. For example, the aspects we considered are the extension of caries in the primary tooth, and the development of the succedaneous permanent tooth. The radiograph shows a primary tooth with succedaneous permanent teeth. Radiographs are needed to determine if pulpotomy can be carried out.  In mature permanent tooth  The tooth should be asymptomatic. There should be no clinical signs and symptoms. From the radiographs, there should be absence of postoperative evidence of pathology.  In immature tooth  Pulpotomy allows the continuation of root formation, leading to tooth end closure, preservation and maintenance of pulp vitality, stronger root structure and greater structural integrity. Indications Primary teeth Primary/deciduous (baby) teeth in children have relatively large pulp spaces. Caries do not have to develop significantly before they reach the pulp chamber. When the soft tissue in the pulp chamber is infected (has bacteria in it) or affected (is inflamed), it can be removed by a dentist or dental therapist under local anaesthetic. If the soft tissue in the canals is still healthy enough, a special medicated filling can be put into the chamber in an attempt to keep the remaining pulp (in the canals) alive. The process of removing the pulp from the chamber is the actual \\"pulpotomy\\", though the word is often used for the entire process including placement of the medication. There are many medicaments that can be used to fill the pulp chamber including zinc-oxide eugenol as well as mineral trioxide aggregate. There are two types of pulpotomy techniques depending the extent of caries in a tooth and the symptoms it presents. A vital pulpotomy or a non-vital pulpotomy can be carried out. However, recent research shows that non-vital pulpotomies are rarely indicated due to their low success rates and it is therefore sometimes better to extract the tooth. Afterwards the tooth is restored with a regular filling, either composite or amalgam, or a stainless steel crown. Due to the process of a pulpotomy causing the tooth to become slightly brittle, a stainless steel crown is normally indicated as the preferred choice of definitive restoration. A pulpotomy can be done to both permanent and primary teeth.  Types   Primary teeth  The indication of this pulpotomy procedure is when pulp exposure occurs during caries removal in a primary tooth with a normal pulp or reversible pulpitis or after a traumatic pulp exposure. Then, the coronal tissue is amputated, and the remaining radicular tissue is judged to be vital without suppuration, pus, necrosis, or excessive bleeding which cannot be controlled by a moist cotton pellet (with saline) after several minutes, and there are no radiographic signs of infection or pathologic resorption. Pulpotomy therapy can be classified according to the following treatment objectives: devitalization (mummification, cauterization), preservation (minimal devitalization, noninductive), or regeneration (inductive, reparative). = Devitalization = Multiple visits with application of formocresol in pulpotomy is used to fix the radicular pulp completely to reduce pulp infection. The radicular pulp was theoretically sterilized and devitalized, thereby reducing infection and internal resorption. Another form of nonchemical devitalization emerged: electrosurgical pulpotomy. Electrocautery releases heat that denatures pulp and reduces bacterial contamination. Experimentally, electrosurgery has been shown to reduce pathologic root resorption and periapical pathology, and a series of pulpal effects including acute and chronic inflammation, swelling and diffuse necrosis. It is reported that this method has high success rate in pulpotomies. However, this method may prove to be more diagnosis and technique sensitive, and it may not be suitable if apical root resorption has occurred. = Preservation = Zinc oxide-eugenol (ZOE) was the first agent to used for preservation. In recent years, glutaraldehyde has been proposed as an alternative to formocresol based on: its superior fixative properties, and low toxicity. A nonaldehyde chemical, ferric sulfate, has received some attention recently as a pulpotomy agent. It minimizes the chances for inflammation and internal resorption. This category of pulp therapy is still in flux, although major changes in the future are not likely. = Regeneration = The ideal pulpotomy treatment should leave the radicular pulp alive and healthy In this case, the tooth should be filled with noxious restorative materials within, thereby diminishing the chances of internal resorption, as well as formation of reparative dentin.Calcium hydroxide was the first agent used in pulpotomies that demonstrated any capacity to induce regeneration of dentin. However, the success rate is not that high. Recent advances in the field of bone and dentin formation have opened exciting new vistas for pulp therapy, which is a factor called bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). It has bone inductive properties, that can predictably induce bone for use in the fields of orthopedic, oral, and periodontal surgery. Most importantly for dentistry, these osteogenic proteins hold promise for pulp therapy.  Young permanent teeth  = Partial Pulpotomy for Carious Exposures = Partial pulpotomy is also indicated in young permanent teeth with pulp exposure due to caries, provided that the bleeding can be controlled within several minutes. It is a procedure in which the inflamed pulp tissue beneath an exposure is removed to a depth of 1 to 3mm or deeper to reach the level of healthy pulp tissue. Pulpal bleeding can be controlled by irrigation of sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine. The site is then covered with a pulpal medicament, calcium hydroxide or MTA, followed by a final restoration that provides a complete seal to prevent any leakage and bacterial contamination following the restoration. After the procedure, the remaining pulp should remain vital and the patient should be free of any adverse clinical signs or symptoms such as sensitivity, pain or swelling. Immature teeth should continue its normal development and apexogenesis. = Partial Pulpotomy for Traumatic Exposures = Tooth crown fractures are one of the most common dental injuries and the pulp is exposed in approximately 25% of all crown fractures. Maintaining vitality of the pulp tissue in an immature tooth is important to allow continued growth of the tooth. Partial pulpotomy due to a traumatic exposure is also known as Cvek Pulpotomy. The procedure involves removal of 1 to 3mm of inflamed pulp tissue beneath an exposure to reach the level of healthy pulp tissue. The surface of the remaining pulp is then irrigated with bacteriocidal irrigants such as sodium hypochlorite or chlorhexidine until bleeding has ceased. The site is then covered with a pulpal medicament, either calcium hydroxide or MTA. The remaining cavity is then restored with a material that provides a complete seal to prevent any leakage and bacterial contamination following the restoration. The remaining pulp tissue should continue to be vital after partial pulpotomy and teeth with immature roots should show continued normal development and apexogenesis. There should be no signs of pain, swelling, or sensitivity after the procedure. Cvek at al reported that partial pulpotomies after a traumatic exposure had a success rate of 96%.  Medicaments  Pulpotomy is a vital pulp therapy, medicaments that can promote healing and preserve the vitality of the tooth should be placed after removal of the inflamed pulp. In primary teeth medicaments such as formocresol, mineral trioxide aggregate, zinc oxide eugenol and calcium hydroxide can be used in pulpotomy. Formocresol use has been questioned due to toxicity concerns. Ferric sulphate, sodium hypochlorite or a local anaesthetic solution containing a vasoconstrictor agent can be used to arrest any bleeding from the pulp prior to the placement of medicament. Calcium enriched mixtures have been used in permanent molar teeth with irreversible pulpitis showing positive outcomes.  Ferric Sulphate  Ferric sulphate is used to arrest pulpal bleeding by forming a sealing membrane through the agglutination of the blood proteins with ferric and sulfate ions. This metal-protein clot at the surface of the pulp may act as a barrier to external irritants. The physiological clot formation is thought to be able to minimise inflammation and internal resorption compared to calcium hydroxide. Most importantly, ferric sulphate causes minimal devitalization and subsequent preservation of the pulp tissue. Ferric sulphate has been shown to have close to a 100% clinical success compared to formocresol (77%) with 1-year follow-up.  Formocresol  Formocresol has been used in pulpotomy procedures of the primary teeth since 80 years. Formocresol is both a bactericidal and devitalizing agent. It kills bacteria and converts the pulp tissue into inert compounds. This action fastens the vital pulp, maintaining them inert and conserves the primary tooth until it falls off physiologically. However, formaldehyde, a primary component in formocresol has raised concerns regarding its safe of use. Formaldehyde is a hazardous substance and has perceived the need to reevaluate the use of formocresol.  Zinc Oxide-eugenol (ZOE)  After pulpal bleeding is arrested, a suitable base such as zinc oxide-eugenol is placed to seal the tooth from microleakage. ZOE is a nontoxic material for pulpal cells and possess antimicrobial as well as anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, it also has local anesthetic or soothing effect on the dental pulp.  Calcium Hydroxide  Calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 is conventionally used as a pulpotomy agent of the permanent teeth but with less long term success. Calcium hydroxide is a highly alkaline (pH 12) material that has bactericidal effect and has the potential to enhance reparative dentin (dentin bridge) formation. However, it also leads to superficial necrosis of the pulp tissue in contact with the medication and has been shown to be toxic to cells in tissue culture. Therefore, in spite being a popular vital pulp therapy material, its use as a pulpotomy agent remains controversial.  Mineral Trioxide Aggregate (MTA)  MTA is a more recent material that constitutes of tricalcium silicate, dicalcium silicate, tricalcium aluminate, tetracalcium aluminoferrite, bismuth oxide and calcium sulphate. MTA is known to have excellent physical characteristics, biocompatibility and has the ability to stimulate cytokine release from pulpal fibroblast, which can stimulate hard tissue formation. It has better structural integrity and forms a thicker, more localized dentinal bridge. MTA results in a more predictable dentin bridge formation and pulpal health. MTA has a high rate of success and has been shown to perform equal or better than formocresol or ferric sulfate. However, the cost, availability and difficulty in handling this material remains its current drawback. Alternative Pulpotomy Techniques  Electro-surgery pulpotomy  Electro-surgical pulpotomy is a method of cutting and coagulating soft tissues by means of high frequency radio waves. It can control bleeding without chemical coagulation and is antibacterial. Electrosurgical pulpotomy has a success rate of 70 to 94%. However, it is considered as a sensitive technique.  Laser pulpotomy  The carbon dioxide laser emits an infrared beam that has an affinity for water, and is capable of producing well-localized cautery to soft tissue. Tissue is removed by ablation through conversion of the laser beam to heat. The carbon dioxide laser appears to be a promising alternative for pulpotomy therapy.  Clinical Significance  Conserving the vitality of pulp tissues appears to be a less painful alternative to root canal treatment (RCT) for younger patients. The high success rate reported for pulpotomy suggests that this procedure offers hope as an alternative to root canal treatment in teeth with a diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis.

While La Ruta Moskitia seems to have stopped functioning 2012-2014, in late 2014 the alliance requested a grant from the United Nations in order to restart its activities.  Accomplishments, awards, and recognition  The Rio Biosphere Reserve, which lies in the heart of La Moskitia, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The La Ruta Moskitia Ecotourism Alliance is in its third year of operations. Within this time through its operations, products, and services the Alliance has already injected more than $350,000 USD into the local communities, created 250 jobs, and supports 1500 immediate family members in the Reserve. Awards and recognition of The La Ruta Moskitia Ecotourism Alliance includes the World Travel and Tourism Council's Tourism for Tomorrow \\"Investor in People\\" award in 2008, the Virgin Holidays Responsible Tourism Award \\"Best Park or Protected Area\\" in 2007, and the Conde Nast Traveler's coveted Green List in 2006. These international rewards were presented to acknowledge the Alliance's quality products, as well as identify its aid towards poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation. In addition, to the awards mentioned above La Ruta Moskitia was recognized as one of National Geographic Adventures \\"Best Adventure Travel Companies on Earth.\\" Finally, several publications have recommended La Ruta Moskitia such as Moon Handbook for Honduras, Lonely Planet and Outside Magazine.M.

This act became the precedent for \\"disability insurance\\" across the country and the precursor to broad-coverage health insurance. President Woodrow Wilson signed H.R. 15316 into law on September 7, 1916. The Federal Employees' Compensation Commission was the original administrator of the FECA. However, the Commission did not exist at the time the FECA went into effect and claims accumulated for more than six months while members were selected and sworn into office. The Federal Employees' Compensation Commission officially began its duties on March 14, 1917. The Commission was abolished on May 16, 1946 by President Harry S. Truman as part of the Reorganization Act of 1939. Its duties were transferred to the Federal Security Agency on July 16, 1946. The Act is now administered by the U.S. Department of Labor.

It lies by the source of the River Tame, high amongst the Pennines above the village of Delph, northeast of Oldham, north-northwest of Uppermill and Shaw and Crompton. It has a population of around 500. Historically a part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Denshaw and its surroundings have provided archaeological evidence of Stone and Bronze Age activity in the area. The name Denshaw is of Old Norse derivation, and the oldest part of the village is an ancient hamlet.. Built up around the junction of five major roads, until the 20th century, Denshaw consisted mainly of smallholdings and a few public houses such as the Junction Inn, originally built as a coaching house for travellers. Denshaw is noted for its annual Whit Friday brass band contest. History There is evidence of Stone Age activity around Denshaw; in 2004 Saddleworth Archaeological Trust objected to the construction of a wind farm on a site on Denshaw Moor which had produced more than 200 Mesolithic artefacts. Human activity in Denshaw continued in the Bronze Age, as demonstrated by the discovery of a palstave on Wall Green in 1932, when a trench was being dug for a water pipe, and some tools from Denshaw Moor, on the site of the proposed wind farm, which include a ceremonial flint dagger. A Roman road may also cross the site. The name Denshaw is derived from Old Norse, suggesting a settlement may have existed there during the period of the Danelaw. Denshaw Fold, the oldest part of the village, is an isolated hamlet of ancient origin. Many of the traditional stone dwellings are listed buildings and are descendants of the cluster of houses first built in the locality during the 16th century. Around 1795, the Junction Inn at Denshaw was erected. It served as a posting house on the Ripponden-to-Oldham turnpike road (opened in 1798) for the changing of horses and the provision of refreshments.Daly, J. D. (N.D.). p. 63. Dowry Reservoir, pictured here in 1967, was built in the late 19th century at the height of the Second Industrial Revolution. Denshaw did not experience the same rate of urbanisation and industrialisation as its surrounding settlements during the Industrial Revolution, and it did not become a mill town or a centre of the local cotton mill boom as did nearby Rochdale, Milnrow and Oldham. However, Denshaw Vale was a calico printing factory which was \\"an important concern that employed a workforce of 150\\" during the 19th century.. Furthermore, Denshaw was chosen as the site of a reservoir which local mills were to contribute monies and thereby use;Daly, J. D. (N.D.). p. 74. In 1828, Rackenden Deign Reservoir was built by Denshaw to provide for 24 watermills.Daly, J. D. (N.D.). p. 79. In 1818 an Oddfellows Lodge was erected in the village. In 1887, Denshaw was documented having a population of 1,279. In 2003, energy company E.ON UK proposed the installation of seven wind turbines at Denshaw. This was met with opposition from the local and wider communities, culminating in the Saddleworth Moors Action Group, who were joined by environmentalist David Bellamy. The council received over 1,000 letters objecting to the proposed wind farm, and although initially accepted by the former Liberal Democrat local authority, the application was rejected by Labour-controlled Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council on 1 March 2006. On 23 May 2007, Denshaw's post office (which doubled-up as the village's only shop) was the centre of a robbery. The \\"tiny premises\\" had been under threat of closure owing to Post Office's modernisation plans and has since closed. Saddleworth Moor, seen from The Rams Head Inn On 17 April 2008, local, national and international media reported on Denshaw's entry on Wikipedia which had been vandalised with spoof information. The entry \\"attracted unwelcome notoriety after it was targeted\\" by editors, although the offending material was removed after initial reports were published. The story featured on the BBC's North West Tonight, a regional news programme, and later picked up by news services as far away as Pakistan. Governance Lying within the ancient county boundaries of Yorkshire since a very early time, during the Middle Ages, Denshaw lay within the Saddleworth chapelry of the ancient parish of Rochdale. Like the other Yorkshire areas of the ancient parish, it was in the wapentake of Agbrigg in Yorkshire, with the Lancashire areas of the ancient parish being in Salfordshire.Youngs, F. A. (1991). page 600, under the entry for Saddleworth. The Byrons (including Romantic poet George Gordon Byron) were prominent land owners in Denshaw.Daly, J. D. (N.D.). p. 72. Denshaw was created an ecclesiastical parish in 1864, out of the former Friarmere parochial chapelry. It was in the deanery of Ashton-under-Lyne from 1864 to 1872. It then became part of Rochdale deanery until 1881 when it again became part of Ashton-under-Lyne. In 1929, it transferred to Oldham deanery.Youngs, F. A. (1991). p. 535. It is currently in Saddleworth Deanery, part of the Archdeanery of Rochdale, in the Anglican Diocese of Manchester. From 1894 to 1900, Denshaw lay within Saddleworth Rural District, a local government district in the administrative County of York, West Riding. In 1900, Denshaw was merged into Saddleworth Urban District, where it stayed until 1974. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Saddleworth Urban District was abolished, and Denshaw has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, within Greater Manchester.HMSO. Local Government Act 1972. 1972 c.70. Denshaw lies within the Saddleworth North electoral ward. Since 1997, Denshaw has formed part of the parliamentary constituency of Oldham East and Saddleworth, and is represented in the House of Commons by Debbie Abrahams, a member of the Labour Party. Between 1983 and 1997 it was in the Littleborough and Saddleworth constituency. Geography At (53.5921¬∞, ‚àí2.0385¬∞) and north-northwest of London, Denshaw stands about above sea level, northeast of Manchester city centre, on elevated Pennine ground by the River Tame, which flows southwesterly from its source near the Dowry and New Year's Bridge reservoirs. The land-use of Denshaw, which centres on a road junction, is predominantly residential, the outlying land being a mixture of permanent grassland and heath. Denshaw lies amongst the South Pennines, and is topographically characterised by hilly, upland terrain. Denshaw is not contiguous with any other settlement and for purposes of the Office for National Statistics, does not form part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area. Denshaw experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. There are a number of small named-localities in and around Denshaw, including Denshaw Fold, Cherry Clough, Junction, Old Tame, Slackcote, Grains Bar and Woodbrow. Landmarks Denshaw's war memorial is situated in the village churchyard. Christ Church is Denshaw's parish church. It is part of the Church of England and lies within the Anglican Diocese of Manchester. A Grade II listed building since 19 June 1967, Christ Church dates from 1863, the year before Denshaw became an ecclesiastical parish. It was built by Henry Gartside, a resident of Denshaw. Denshaw War Memorial lies within the churchyard. It was erected by public subscription \\"in honour of the men who fell and served\\" in the First and Second World Wars. The monument has Rolls of Honour containing the 32 names of those from Denshaw who fought and died in these wars. Transport Denshaw lies south of the M62 motorway, at a road junction where the A640, A672 and A6052 roads intersect. There are no rail services in Denshaw. Following closure of the Oldham Loop Line, the nearest railway station to Denshaw is located at Greenfield. Two bus routes serve Denshaw. One is the daily 407 service between Denshaw and Oldham via Pennine Meadows and Moorside run by Stotts and operating hourly during the daytime. The other is the 354, running from Denshaw to Ashton-under-Lyne via Delph, Uppermill, Mossley and Stalybridge. It is operated by First Greater Manchester and runs every two hours Monday‚ÄìSaturday daytime. There are no evening journeys on either service, they are replaced by a Local Link demand responsive transport service instead. In its guise as the 562 route, it carried on to Halifax in West Yorkshire. This was withdrawn in April 2006. At one point, the first and last journeys of the 354 were extended to Rochdale, when the service was worked by Bu-Val Buses earlier on in the 21st century. Culture and community Since 1993, Denshaw has held an annual brass band contest. Denshaw is noted for its annual brass band contest, held on every Whit Friday. The Denshaw Whit Friday Band Contest was established in 1993 and in its first year attracted 25 bands. Denshaw has a primary school named Christ Church Primary. It is a denominational school with the Church of England, linked with Denshaw's parish church. Denshaw village hall is the home of an amateur dramatic group and hosts various village activities; the hall was awarded a grant of ¬£10,000 by the Awards for All scheme, a small grants scheme run by the National Lottery. Denshaw is referred to in Barclay James Harvest's 1993 song Ballad of Denshaw Mill. Public services Home Office policing in Denshaw is provided by the Greater Manchester Police. The force's \\"(Q) Division\\" have their headquarters for policing the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham at central Oldham; Denshaw's nearest police station is at Uppermill. Public transport is co-ordinated by Transport for Greater Manchester. Statutory emergency fire and rescue service is provided by the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service. There are no hospitals in Denshaw, the nearest being the Royal Oldham Hospital, in neighbouring Oldham. Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust is the local NHS Trust. The North West Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport to and from Denshaw. Other forms of health care are provided for locally by several small clinics and surgeries in and around Saddleworth.

Weyman, first published in 1894. Often described as his best work,Tellers of Tales by Roger Lancelyn Green, 1946, Edmund Ward (p. 175 of the 1964 reprint) - Green quotes Conan Doyle and Stevenson. it was also the most commercially successful, going through 34 reprints, the last in 1962. As with other Weyman novels, it takes place during the French religious wars of the early 17th century. Since it contains a real historical event, the Day of the Dupes, the timing is the autumn of 1630 when Cardinal Richelieu (the 'Red Robe') was Chief Minister for Louis XIII. Under his guidance, the French state was supporting Protestants in Germany as part of the 30 Years War while suppressing domestic Protestants or Huguenots in South-West France. The plot features one of Weyman's more interesting characters, Gil de Berault, a gambler and notorious dueller living in Paris who sometimes acts as hired muscle for the Cardinal. He fights one duel too many and is given the choice between execution or helping the Cardinal capture a key Huguenot rebel. He picks the second option and ultimately achieves his objectives but in the process meets a good woman. The novel was well received by contemporary historical novelists. Conan Doyle wrote that Under the Red Robe had \\"the most dramatic opening of any historical novel I know\\" and Siegfried Sassoon described his excitement as a schoolboy on first reading a copy. It was adapted for the stage at the Haymarket Theatre in 1896, also playing on Broadway and first filmed in 1923 as a silent movie.Under the Red Robe (1923) at the Internet Movie Database A second version was made in 1937, the British swashbuckler Under the Red Robe directed by Victor Sj√∂str√∂m and featuring Conrad Veidt as Gil de Berault, Raymond Massey as the Cardinal and French actress Annabella as the romantic interest.

The designation \\"pUC\\" is derived from the classical \\"p\\" prefix (denoting \\"plasmid\\") and the abbreviation for the University of California, where early work on the plasmid series had been conducted. It is a circular double stranded DNA and has 2686 base pairs.pUC19 description & restriction map pUC19 is one of the most widely used vector molecules as the recombinants, or the cells into which foreign DNA has been introduced, can be easily distinguished from the non-recombinants based on color differences of colonies on growth media. pUC18 is similar to pUC19, but the MCS region is reversed.  Components  Notably, it has an N-terminal fragment of Œ≤-galactosidase (lacZ) gene of E. coli. The multiple cloning site (MCS) region is split into codons 6-7 of the lacZ gene, providing for many restriction endonucleases restriction sites. In addition to Œ≤-galactosidase, pUC19 also encodes for an ampicillin resistance gene (ampR), via a Œ≤-lactamase enzyme that functions by degrading ampicillin and reducing its toxicity to the host. The ori site, or origin of replication, is derived from the plasmid pMB1. pUC19 is small but has a high copy number. The high copy number is a result of the lack of the rop gene and a single point mutation in the ori of pMB1. The lacZ gene codes for Œ≤-galactosidase. The recognition sites for HindIII, SphI, PstI, SalI, XbaI, BamHI, SmaI, KpnI, SacI and EcoRI restriction enzymes have been derived from the vector M13mp19.  Function  This plasmid is introduced into a bacterial cell by a process called \\"transformation\\", where it can multiply and express itself. However, due to the presence of MCS and several restriction sites, a foreign piece of DNA of choice can be introduced into it by inserting it into place in MCS region. The cells which have taken up the plasmid can be differentiated from cells which have not taken up the plasmid by growing it on media with ampicillin. Only the cells with the plasmid containing the ampicillin resistance (ampR) gene will survive. Furthermore, the transformed cells containing the plasmid with the gene of interest can be distinguished from cells with the plasmid but without the gene of interest, just by looking at the color of the colony they make on agar media supplemented with IPTG and X-gal. Recombinants are white, whereas non-recombinants are blue.  Mechanism  A schematic representation of the molecular mechanism involved for screening recombinant cells The lac Z fragment, whose synthesis can be induced by IPTG, is capable of intra-allelic complementation with a defective form of Œ≤-galactosidase enzyme encoded by host chromosome (mutation lacZDM15 in E. coli JM109, DH5Œ± and XL1-Blue strains). In the presence of IPTG in growth medium, bacteria synthesise both fragments of the enzyme. Both the fragments can together hydrolyse X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- beta-D-galactopyranoside) and form blue colonies when grown on media where it is supplemented. Insertion of foreign DNA into the MCS located within the lac Z gene causes insertional inactivation of this gene at the N-terminal fragment of beta-galactosidase and abolishes intra- allelic complementation. Thus bacteria carrying recombinant plasmids in the MCS cannot hydrolyse X-gal, giving rise to white colonies, which can be distinguished on culture media from non-recombinant cells, which are blue. Therefore, the media used should contain ampicillin, IPTG, and X-gal.  Use in research  Due to its extensive use as a cloning vector in research and industry, pUC19 is frequently used in research as a model plasmid. For example, biophysical studies on its naturally supercoiled state have determined its radius of gyration to be 65.6 nm and its Stokes radius to be 43.6 nm.

It served as a fortification for defence and is one of Munich's three remaining gothic town gates (the other two being the Isartor and the Karlstor). Location The gate seen from Sendlinger-Tor-Platz Sendlinger Tor (located at Sendlinger Str 49) lies at the southern end of Sendlingerstrasse, the north-south thoroughfare through Munich's old town. Sendlinger Tor thus separates the old city from the Isar suburb. Sendlinger Tor is at an altitude of above sea level. History Colourful Bustle in Front of Sendlinger Tor in Munich (1840) Sendlinger Tor, 1918 As part of the great urban expansion by Ludwig the Bavarian (from 1285 to 1337), a second city wall with four town gates was built, of which Sendlinger Tor was one. In 1318, Sendlinger Tor was first mentioned as a starting point for the road to Italy, but probably existed earlier. Originally, there was only the distinctive central tower gate (typical of the Munich city gates of the time). In 1420 that was supplemented by the two flanking towers, which were required to terminate the end of the outer city wall properly. In 1808 the central tower was demolished. In 1860 a restoration of the two remaining Medieval flanking towers and the wall with three arches took place. In 1906, these original three arches were replaced by the one large single arch. In the Second World War, the gate was barely damaged. It was refurbished in the 1980s. On the Sendlinger Tor, a remnant of the old city wall can still be seen, which previously went up the Herzog- Wilhelm-Str.

Among other reasons, it arises when the petition of concern procedure is invoked.  Background  Upon taking their seats members of the Northern Ireland Assembly are required to designate themselves as either \\"unionist\\", \\"nationalist\\" or \\"other\\". Members may change their designation of identity only if they become a member of a (different) political party or they cease to be a member of any political party. The election of the Speaker, appointment of the Minister of Justice, any changes to the standing orders and the adoption of certain money bills must all occur with cross-community support. This was originally set out in the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Petition of concern Votes in the assembly do not ordinarily require cross-community support. However, if a \\"petition of concern\\" is raised successfully about proposed legislation or executive action, the speaker must call a cross-community vote. For a petition to be raised successfully, at least 30 of the 90 members must sign the petition. In a cross-community vote, the majority of unionists' and the majority of nationalists' votes are each required to pass a motion put to the assembly. , petitions of concern have been tabled 159 times since 1998; they have been used to block same-sex marriage, abortion law reform and even censure of politicians. Section 42 of the 1998 Act declares that However Standing Order 28 on Petitions of Concern does not mention this committee and () no such committee has been established. Arising from the St Andrews Agreement, an \\"Assembly and Executive Review Committee\\" was set up. Among its Terms of Reference, the Committee was to consider \\"provisions for voting on an Ad Hoc Committee on Conformity with Equality Requirements prior to the vote on a Petition of Concern.\\" It also \\"considered the possibilities of restricting Petition of Concern to certain key areas, changing the 30 MLA threshold, and alternatives to Petitions of Concern (e.g. a weighted majority vote). There was no consensus on any of the issues.\\".  Procedure  According to the standing orders of the assembly, \\"after the signing of the Roll a Member may enter in the Roll a designation of identity, being Nationalist, Unionist or Other.

Both nations are members of the European Union and NATO and, together with Luxembourg, form the Low Countries and the Benelux economic union. Relations Relations were established after Belgium became independent from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1839. Both nations are great allies with cultural similarities and close cooperation between both governments. The language spoken in Belgium is known as Dutch/Flemish (Nederlands/Vlaams), and is the most-spoken language in both countries. Approximately 35,000 Belgian nationals live in the Netherlands, while there are around 111,000 Dutch nationals in Belgium. Thanks to their shared history and the Dutch language, the Netherlands and Belgium have strong cultural ties. In 1980, the two countries set up the Dutch Language Union to encourage greater cooperation in the field of Dutch language and literature. The Union offers services including language tools like dictionaries and a language advice service, education in and about Dutch, literature and reading skills, and activities promoting the Dutch language in Europe and the rest of the world. The Union also works to showcase the two countries‚Äô shared cultural heritage.

It was painted in 1882 by Friedrich Perlberg. The factory was located at Maillingerstra√üe 33. The newly built, in the years 1922/23, administration building was sold to the Deutsche Reichsbahn. The composer Carl Orff, was born in 1895 in the Maillingerstra√üe 16 and lived there until October 1939. From 1924 on, the Gr√ºnsfelder brothers owned a wholesale metal shop at Maillingerstra√üe 23, the former bell foundry of Ulrich Kortler (1846-1928). They emigrated to the United States during the course of Aryanization in Munich. Former areas belonging to Maillingerstra√üe were renamed in 1965/67 to Helmholtzstra√üe (the Munich ATEGE camp II in the Maillingerstra√üe 73 became Helmholtzstra√üe 15), other areas were added to the newly established Marsstra√üe. From 1890, the street leading from Marsstra√üe was first called Haslangstra√üe, named after the Bavarian field marshal, then from 1947, Baudrexelstra√üe, named after the master builder Josef Baudrexel (1861-1943). The State salary office located here held the house number 2. Which after the integration into the new building of the State Office of Criminal Investigation became Maillingerstra√üe 11. In 1995, the Consulate General of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was shortly housed in Maillingerstra√üe 32.  Cartography  In the Munich map of the 4th edition of Meyers Konversations-Lexikon (1888), the Maillingerstra√üe is partially depicted. The area of today's even house numbers, 2 to 24, appears to be built on. The Munich map of the 14th edition of the Brockhaus Konversations-Lexikon (1891) shows the entire Maillingerstra√üe, further developed and including the locomotive factory and the infantry barracks.  Transportion history  From 21 October, 1876, the first line of Munich's horse tram from Promenade Square to later named \\"Burgfrieden-Maillingerstra√üe\\" in the Nymphenburger Stra√üe, ended here, and was the precursor of the electric tram.  Today's transportation connections  Near the Maillingerstra√üe, located on the Nymphenburger Stra√üe is the underground station Maillingerstra√üe, for the U1 / U7 lines of the Munich subway, which opened on 8 May, 1983.

Mar Y Cel or, more correctly, Mar i Cel (Catalan: \\"Sea and Sky\\") is an open space preserve conserved by the Land Trust for Santa Barbara County, in Santa Barbara County, California, USA. Located in the Santa Ynez Mountains foothills above Montecito, Mar Y Cel is a estate. It includes the notable \\"Tea Gardens\\", as well as the West Fork of Cold Springs Trail, a well used hiking trail. Early history Henry E. Bothin (pronounced, \\"bo-THEEN\\") (d. 1923), of Ohio, came to San Francisco where he built an empire, starting with a spice and coffee factory in 1875, and then gaining large commercial real estate holdings. He was president of Judson Manufacturing Company. Around 1916, Bothin and his second wife, the heiress Ellen \\"Nellie\\" Chabot Bothin (1865-1965), added the Mar Y Cel property, commonly referred to as the \\"Tea Gardens\\", to their Montecito estate home, Piranhurst, which was nearing completion. Ellen's deceased father, Antoine \\"Anthony\\" Chabot, had been notable for his Bay Area water systems, and had been a colleague of Bothin's. Upon Mar Y Cel, the Bothins built stone aqueducts, water works, arches, and statues. The water projects included scalloped bowls that rested on columns, allowing water to spill from one into the other. After completion, 35 gardeners maintained the area. Other construction included a 200-seat amphitheater, as well as the \\"Tea House\\", built as an open-air piazza, surrounded by four walls. In 1918, Ellen was honored with a gladiolus named in her behalf, the Mrs. H. E. Bothin. Following the June 29, 1925, magnitude 6.3, Santa Barbara earthquake, three of the Tea House walls were damaged. Subsequently, atmospheric painter and landscape designer Lockwood de Forest, Jr. (1850-1932), added red brick garden planters to the property, while the water garden system was remodeled, costing one million dollars. After Ellen's death, Edward F. Brown purchased a portion of Piranhurst from the family heirs, that led to the \\"Tea Gardens\\" property becoming a separate parcel which the Bothin family sold to Mr. Shirley Carter Burden (1908-1989), fine arts photographer, writer, and great-great-grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt. Burden later resold it to the current owners. Later history In September 2000, Cima del Mundo LLC, an environmental investment group, offered to donate a conservation easement on a portion of Mar Y Cel: the northern . This eliminated the possibility of future residential development while ensuring the protection of both wildlife habitat and the property's scenic beauty. In addition, the company granted a easement to the Land Trust ensuring that a portion of the Cold Spring Trail is open for public use. On November 13, 2008, the Montecito Tea Fire ignited the historic \\"Tea House\\" structure, above Mountain Drive. Over the course of several days, the fire spread and burned , destroyed over 200 homes, and injured 13 people. References External links * Archives.si.edu: Photos of \\"Mrs. H.E.

F. (October 2005). \\"Piscivorous Behavior of a Temperate Cone Snail, Conus californicus\\". Biological Bulletin 209: 146‚Äì153. full text. The range of this species is from the Farallon Islands near San Francisco to Bahia Magdalena, in Baja California, Mexico. This cone is found in both rocky and sandy areas, in the intertidal zone, and subtidally down to 30 meters depth. Shell description This shell is distinguished by its grayish-brown color and thick periostracum. It is round-shouldered with the aperture broader at the base. The spire is flat-sided, and the height of the shell ranges from 25‚Äì40 mm.McLean, James H., 1978 Marine Shells of Southern California, Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County Museum, Science Series 24, 51‚Äì52. Feeding habits The California cone hunts and eats marine worms, fish, and other mollusks. It is also a scavenger.

Early years and education John Brownlee was born in Casper, Wyoming on January 31, 1965. His father, Les Brownlee, was an infantry officer assigned to the 101st Airborne Division. Brownlee's father began the first of two tours in Vietnam when John was only 6 months old. His mother, Nancy Long Hoyler, was an elementary school teacher who later worked with the Fairfax County, Virginia Head Start program. He has one sister, Tracy Brownlee Carney of Falls Church, Virginia. Brownlee is married to former television news anchor and reporter, Lee Ann Necessary. They have two daughters. Brownlee graduated from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia in 1987 and received a B.S. degree in Business Administration and Accounting. In 1994, Brownlee graduated from the William & Mary School of Law in Williamsburg, Virginia. He served as a judicial law clerk for U.S. District Judge Sam Wilson in Roanoke, Virginia from 1994 to 1996. From 1997 to 2001, Brownlee served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia in Washington, DC. Military service Brownlee was awarded an Army ROTC scholarship and graduated a Distinguished Military Graduate from Washington and Lee University. He was commissioned as an Infantry lieutenant and graduated from the Army's Airborne and Ranger programs. He served four years on active duty in the Infantry. Brownlee attended The JAG School at the University of Virginia and entered U.S. Army JAG Corps. He received an honorable discharge in 2007 at the rank of Major. United States Attorney President George W. Bush, on the recommendation of U.S. Senators John Warner and George Allen, nominated Brownlee to be the United States Attorney for the Western District of Virginia in 2001. Brownlee was sworn in as U.S. Attorney on August 30, 2001 and unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate on October 11, 2001. Investigation of Purdue Pharma In May 2007, after a five-year investigation, the pharmaceutical company Purdue Pharma, LP was convicted of illegally misbranding their pain medication OxyContin. OxyContin is a Schedule II prescription pain relief medication, classified as having the highest potential for abuse of legally available drugs. Purdue and the three executives admitted that Purdue fraudulently marketed OxyContin by falsely claiming that OxyContin was less addictive, less subject to abuse, and less likely to cause withdrawal symptoms than other pain medications when there was no medical research to support these claims and without Food and Drug Administration approval of these claims. The company and executives paid over $634 million in fines, and the executives were placed on 3 years probation and ordered to perform 400 hours of community service. While the settlement was one of the largest financial penalties ever imposed on a drug company, under pressure from Purdue lawyer Rudy Giuliani Brownlee agreed to modify the prosecution so that Purdue Pharma's holding company, Purdue Frederick, would plead to a single misbranding charge so that Purdue Pharma would not have a criminal conviction on their name, which would prevent them from doing business with the U.S. Government. Brownlee also gave Purdue Pharma immunity from further prosecution up to and for future offenses after this plea deal, continuing until 2007. As the company continued selling Oxycontin without restriction after their conviction, The New York Times claimed that \\"Purdue suffered a crushing defeat in May at the hands of Brownlee when the company and three top executives pleaded guilty to criminal charges.\\" Despite this outcome, on July 31, 2007 Mr. Brownlee testified before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee regarding his investigation of Purdue and its executives.\\"Testimony of John L.

This fine young United States Attorney committed several years of his life to this case and did something nobody else has done: put an end to this OxyContin abuse, which is an absolute national problem.\\" Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) stated that Brownlee's work \\"will have a major impact on corporate conduct in our country.\\" National security investigation In March 2007, after a six-year investigation, ITT Corporation, the 12th largest supplier of sophisticated defense systems to the United States military, pleaded guilty to violating the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). ITT was convicted of illegally transferring classified and controlled night vision technology to foreign countries, including China, and agreed to pay $100 million in penalties. Brownlee was the first federal prosecutor to convict a major defense contractor of violating the ITAR. ITT Corporation admitted that between March 2001 and August 2001, ITT Corporation exported defense related technical data to Singapore, the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom without having first obtained a license or written authorization from the U.S. Department of State. The technical data included information about a laser counter measure known as a \\"light interference filter\\" for military night vision goggle systems. The investigation and prosecution of ITT Corporation created important industry reaction. Global Watch, a web based Newsletter of the International Import- Export Institute called the convictions \\"record breaking\\" and \\"precedent setting\\" and claimed that Brownlee's work would have a \\"significant long-term impact on the trade compliance community worldwide.\\" The Wall Street Journal wrote that Brownlee's \\"ITT case is bound to send shivers through the U.S. defense industry, which increasingly views international trade as vital for long-term growth.\\" Use of the Violence Against Women Act On October 12, 1996, Brent Simmons drove from Florida to Harrisonburg, Virginia, and brutally murdered his ex-girlfriend Ann Olson and her boyfriend Keith O'Connell after stalking and harassing both victims for months. Simmons was prosecuted by state authorities for both murders in 1998, but the jury was unable to agree on a verdict and a mistrial was declared. Several months later, the local prosecutor allowed Simmons to enter into a plea agreement to the murders in exchange for a 20-year term of imprisonment. Simmons was scheduled to be released from prison at the age of 41. In 2003, the newly elected Commonwealth Attorney in Harrisonburg, Ms. Marsha Garst, asked Brownlee to review the case. Garst hoped that federal authorities could do something to keep Simmons from being released. After careful study, Brownlee developed a novel legal theory by using the Violence Against Women's Act, which had been enacted only 13 days prior to the murders, and federal firearms charges. In 2005, Brownlee charged Simmons with two counts of using a firearm during the commission of the violent crime of interstate stalking, made criminal by the 1996 Violence Against Women Act. After a 2-week trial in February 2005, the jury convicted Simmons of the two murders but was unable to reach a unanimous decision on the death penalty. Simmons was immediately sentenced by the trial court to life in prison without the possibility of parole.Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police. \\"Brownlee, Whitmore receive Outstanding Contribution to Law Enforcement Awards.\\" August 13, 2008. http://www.vachiefs.org/news/item/brownlee_whitmore_receive_outstanding_contribution_to_law_enforcement_award/ First federal death penalty verdict in Western District of Virginia In 2007, Brownlee and Assistant U.S. Attorney Tony Giorno prosecuted a federal inmate for committing a violent prison murder.

Frank Cassell= On November 2, 2006, a federal Grand Jury charged 20 defendants for their roles in a racketeering conspiracy that included the distribution of illegal drugs, theft of drugs and firearms under the custody of the Henry County Sheriff's Office, money laundering, and obstruction of justice. Thirteen of the twenty defendants were current or former employees of the Henry County, Virginia Sheriff's Office. Eighteen of the defendants, including the sheriff, were convicted of felony offenses, and two were placed on pre-trial diversion. According to the indictment, since 1998, sworn officers, employees, and associates of the Henry County Sheriff's Office engaged in a continuous scheme to steal narcotics, firearms, and other contraband from the seized evidence property room. The defendants took cocaine, crack cocaine, marijuana, and firearms, and then sold the stolen drugs and guns back into the community. The Grand Jury also has alleged that several of the defendants stole seized firearms and other contraband for their own personal use. Sheriff Frank Cassell was convicted of making false statements to agents of the FBI. Specifically, Sheriff Cassell had been told of various illegal activities involving Henry County Sheriff's Deputies including the distribution of two kilograms of cocaine, embezzlement, and the use of steroids by several high- ranking members of the Henry County Sheriff's Office. Cassell covered up these illegal activities in several ways; by not pursuing investigations and by agreeing to pass on any law enforcement information to the offending parties so they could avoid apprehension, by making false statements to federal investigators and by attempting to aid former Sergeant James Alden Vaught in a money laundering scheme to disguise the source of money represented to have been derived from the distribution of cocaine. Specifically, Cassell acknowledged that he attempted to help Vaught give $10,000 of known drug proceeds the appearance of legitimacy by cosigning for a loan for Vaught. Cassell then counseled Vaught to deposit small amounts of cash into a checking account to pay off the loan. In addition, Cassell agreed with Vaught never to mention the existence of the money derived from illegal drug distribution and then lied to investigators, saying he knew nothing about Vaught's illegal drug activities. =United States v. Carl B. Hutcherson= In May 2005, Carl B. Hutcherson, the Mayor of Lynchburg, Virginia, was convicted of defrauding two social security disability recipients and a charitable organization, making false statements to bank officials and federal investigators and obstruction of justice. The evidence at trial indicated that Mr. Hutcherson and Hutcherson Funeral Home, Inc. became mired in financial difficulties, and, among other things, failed to make required tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service in an amount in excess of $100,000, failed to maintain balances in banking accounts, failed to make required payments to the City of Lynchburg, Virginia, and failed to meet other financial obligations. In response to his financial problems, Mr. Hutcherson committed a series of criminal acts in an effort to obtain money. Specifically, Mr. Hutcherson, as the representative payee for two Social Security disability recipients for whom Mr. Hutcherson managed their financial affairs, used their Social Security benefits for his own personal use. Mr. Hutcherson used the victims' money and made cash payments to himself, purchased a television for himself, purchased a stereo for himself, purchased a mattress for another person, made a payment to an associate and purchased life insurance policies payable on the demise of Victim One with the beneficiary being Carl Hutcherson. Also, Mr. Hutcherson, after being confronted with evidence that he stole money from his charity, provided false information to officials of the Bank of the James, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the federal Grand Jury. Dismissal during U.S. attorneys controversy Brownlee was included on the list of the second set of U.S. attorneys who were to be controversially fired in 2006.

The content which the utility serves is mostly restricted to Indian boundaries and is offered in 4 regional languages. The content includes thematic maps related to disasters, agriculture, water resources, land cover and also processed satellite data of ISRO. Bhuvan is known for its association with various sections of Government of India to enable the use of Geospatial technology. Bhuvan has since its inception enabled Indian government to host public geospatial data as Information layers for visualisation and public consumption. Examples of the types of geospatial layers include Toll Information System for National Highways Authority of India , Islands information System for MHA, Cultural heritage sites for Ministry of culture etc. The information for the platform is obtained from the government of India sources or through Crowdsourcing.  Overview  ISRO launched the beta version of its web-based GIS tool, Bhuvan, on August 12, 2009. Bhuvan offers detailed imagery of Indian locations compared to other Virtual Globe Software, with spatial resolutions ranging up to 1 metre. At present 177 cities High resolution datasets are available, while the other part of the country is covered by 2.5m resolution imagery. The images available do not include any military installations in India, due to security concerns. The National Remote Sensing Agency played an important role in the development of this product. ISRO has used data provided by satellites including Resourcesat-1, Cartosat-1 and Cartosat-2 to get the best possible imagery of India.  Criticism  Since the launch of Bhuvan, users have experienced various difficulties. One problem is that the Bhuvan site has, at various times, been either inaccessible or very slow (due to less band width and servers). Users are required to register before they can use the product, and downloads of plug- ins up to 11 MB in size are needed for the application to work. Furthermore, the plugin only works on Windows, and only Internet Explorer is supported. However now Bhuvan is improving and does not require Login to visualize the maps. Users need to register only when they wish to download satellite data (up to 25m resolution LISS-III data) and products (like NDVI, OHC datasets, Cartosat Digital Elevation Model etc.) To overcome the Plugin restrictions and platform-dependency for 3D -visualization, Bhuvan has come with a WebGL based open-source virtual globe. It only requires WebGL enabled browsers. It renders layers unevenly and sometimes images are completely blocked. Bhuvan promises images from a perceived altitude of 10 metres, but technical analysts dispute the results. If many locations of same name exist, Bhuvan is supposed to give multiple results so that users can choose the intended location, but Bhuvan sometimes fails to return multiple results. Since the initial, buggy beta release, a more stable version has been released, with which users have reported fewer problems. A discussion forum has also been started for users experiencing difficulties.

From 7, New Burlington Street, London 1884 The arms of Enrique Doetsch Henry Doetsch, 1866 Henry Doetsch (31 January 1839 - 25 May 1894) was a German born industrialist who lived in London. He was born Heinrich Moritz Doetsch the 31 January 1839 at the \\"Burghof\\", the 17th century manor of his family in K√§rlich (M√ºlheim-K√§rlich, Wei√üenthurm, Rheinland). Because of a lung weakness, Henry (Enrique) Doetsch went (after a short time in Liverpool) as a young man of 23 years to Sevilla in Spain, where he entered with the help of his cousin, Moritz Willmar-Doetsch from Frankfurt/Main, as volunteer a British company. A few years later he was founder of the ¬ªFirma Sundheim y Doetsch¬´ in Huelva (1865) with his compagnon Guillermo Sundheim (1840 - 1903). In 1873 Doetsch was the director of the Rio Tinto Company Limited, (RTCL), (Minas de R√≠o Tinto), in London and Huelva. Together with Hugh Matheson, chairman of the Rio Tinto Company, and Guillermo (Wilhelm) Sundheim he built up a railway line in Andalucia: The ¬ªCompa√±√≠a del Ferrocarril de Zafra a Huelva¬´. Doetsch held a patent in Canada for an extraction process to remove copper from its ores, registered in September 1879, so he was involved in mining and production of copper in R√≠o Tinto by the so-called ¬ªDoetsch process¬´. But the use of Teladas poisoned the air and many residents became ill or died. Henry Doetsch fell out with Hugh Matheson on the issue of supply of the Miners (Sundheim had left the RTCL in 1876). During an uprising of the miners in 1888 more than 100 civilians were killed by Spanish soldiers. Doetsch left Spain in autumn 1884, after he had invited his old friend ¬ªFred¬´ Burnaby to spend a month at Huelva. A few weeks later Burnaby gave up all his engagements, and fared forth for the Soudan. The three times offered title of a ¬ªMarqu√©s de R√≠o Tinto¬´ by the Spanish King Alfonso XII refused Enrique Doetsch. He was awarded the grand cross of the Orden de Isabel la Cat√≥lica. For many summertimes, Doetsch has been a traveling companion of the Infanta Maria de la Paz and the Infanta Eulalia of Spain. Henry Doetsch was succeeded at the Rio Tinto Group by his nephew Carlos Doetsch (1870 - 1951), who married in 1902 Justita Sundheim de la Cueva, daughter of Guillermo Sundheim and Justa de la Cueva y Camporedondo. The couple with the children Mercedes and Jorge lived in Huelva and Madrid. In London Henry Doetsch lived as a respected financier at 7 New Burlington Street. A generous host and notorious bachelor, Doetsch opened his home and Art Gallery to an interested audience. Still in Spain Henry Doetsch started to collect pictures by old masters. Staying in contact with Bernard Berenson, masterpieces by great painters were gathered in the collection: Titian, Veronese, Guido Reni, Dolci, Lorenzo Lotto, Palma Vecchio, Pontormo, Bronzino, Andrea del Sarto, van Dyck, Rubens, Breughel, Rembrandt, Frans Hals, Wouwerman, Clouet and Holbein. Some of the paintings came from important galleries: Orl√©ans-Galliera, Palazzo Vendramin (Henri Duc de Bordeaux), The Collection King Charles I, Pinacotece Lochis, or from privat collections as those of the Duke of Roxburghe, the Marquis of Donegall or Conte Alborghetti. Doetsch's evenings at New Burlington Street were famous: Among his guests the Prince of Wales (Edward VII), Lord Rosebery and his friend Colonel Burnaby. Doetsch was a lover of black Havana cigars; he died of pneumonia on 25 May 1894 in London. After Doetsch's death in 1894, on 22nd, 24th and 25 June 1895, his pictures of Old Masters were auctioned by Christie's (Messrs. Christie, Manson and Woods), at their offices and sale rooms at 8 King Street, St. James's Square, and the sale appears to have been an enormous success. Some fine examples of paintings are now owned by H. M. the Queen and the House of Hesse at Kronberg. Henry Doetsch's career appears to have mirrored that of his countryman, Ludwig Mond, but Dr. Mond is remembered through the company that bears his name (Brunner-Mond) and the Mond Room at the National Gallery in London; Doetsch is largely forgotten.

It was first published in 2003 by Clarion Books. Plot summary The Moon rises and shines through a girl's bedroom window. It then shines on a silent street, corn and wheat fields, and autumn trees. A young girl and her cat play a game by its light, a pilot flies a plane using its light. The Moon sets in the daylight as the young girl and her cat say goodnight. Reception Shawn Brommer in his review for School Library Journal said \\"Fletcher's poetic prose makes use of gentle tempo and internal rhyme. Imaginative metaphors add to the text; as the Moon sets, it sprinkles \\"silver coins like a careless millionaire.\\" Careful use of second-person narrative draws readers into the text. Kiesler's luminous oil paintings portray the luscious Moon glow, and a refrained use of brush stroke captures the mystery of nighttime when the familiar world becomes exotic, dazzling, and alive with nocturnal life. Warm hues evoke homey, autumn scenes.\\" Terry Day in her review for Library Media Connection described it as a beautifully written and illustrated book. Publishers Weekly said that \\"Fletcher's lyrical, child- friendly images will linger in readers' minds. With a gentle nod to Margaret Wise Brown, the child's morning is the moon's setting Ca sleepy head winking/ falling/slow motion/ onto its pillow\\"), and the book ends appropriately with the girl bidding, \\"Good night, harvest moon.\\"\\" Kirkus Reviews said \\"Fletcher tracks that moon's nocturnal path in language rich in metaphor: \\"With silent slippers / it climbs the night stairs,\\" \\"staining earth and sky with a ghostly glow,\\" lighting up a child's bedroom, the wings of a small plane, moonflowers, and, ranging further afield, harbor waves and the shells of turtle hatchlings on a beach. Using creamy brushwork and subtly muted colors, Kiesler depicts each landscape, each night creature from Luna moths to a sleepless child and her cat, as well as the great moon sweeping across star-flecked skies, from varied but never vertiginous angles.\\" Notes External links *Ralph Fletcher's website *Kate Kiesler's website Category:American picture books Category:2003 children's books Category:Picture books by Ralph Fletcher Category:Moon in fiction Category:Books about cats Category:Children's poetry ","title":"Hello, Harvest Moon"},{"id":"20296427","text":"Randy Spendlove is an American record producer, songwriter, Grammy Awardhttps://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/randy-spendlove winner, and music executive.

Personal life Born in Tucson, O'Dunne was the son Judge Edmund F. Dunne, who was Chief Justice of the Arizona Territory at the time. His mother Josephine Cecelia Warner, though originally from Mississippi herself, was part of an old Virginia family. In 1894 he graduated from St. Mary's College (now Belmont Abbey) in North Carolina. Two years later he would receive an M.A. from St. Mary's as well. It was during this time that Eugene legally changed his last name to the ancestral family name of O'Dunne, while at the same time dropping his middle name of Antonio. This was done as to further emphasize his Irish heritage. He practiced law with his father in Jacksonville, Florida at the firm of Dunne and O'Dunne. He later went on to receive a law degree in 1900 from the University of Maryland.American Bar Association Journal 1970, Volume 56, pp 650-655 In 1904, Judge O‚ÄôDunne was married to the great grandniece of John Quincy Adams. He and his spouse owned a home in Baltimore and a summer residence in Blue Ridge Summit, located in Pennsylvania. The couple had six children together: Mrs. E. Gettings Merryman, Eugene O'Dunne Jr., Mrs. John P Winand, Samillon O'Dunne, Hamilton O‚ÄôDunneReport of the Maryland State Bar Association Mid-Winter Meeting; January 23, 1960, pp 18-20 and David O'Dunne. Eugene's wife suffered from paralysis and died on August 30, 1935. Years after her death, O'Dunne would later remarry to Mrs. Helen Keep in 1950. Eugene O'Dunne is also the older brother of noted Santa Fe society columnist and author Brian Boru Dunne (1877‚Äì1962), who wrote for The Santa Fe New Mexican for most of the first half of the 20th century. He died in 1959 in Ogunquit, Maine at a home belonging to his second wife. O'Dunne was interred in the New Cathedral Cemetery in Baltimore City, Maryland.http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gsr&GSln;=O%27Dunne&GSiman;=1&GScid;=640847& His father is buried there as well.  Beliefs  O'Dunne was raised as a Roman Catholic. Despite the racism existing in Maryland, Judge O‚ÄôDunne ruled against segregation. He sought justice and enforced the law equally for Caucasians and African Americans. Pearson vs. Murray provided an example of this because he ruled against school segregation. O'Dunne favored neither the rich nor the poor, and applied the law equally among all individuals.  Career  Throughout his judicial career, the community had favored O'Dunne for his respectful point of view regarding the rights of each person. After serving many years on the supreme bench of Baltimore, he retired from the bench in Baltimore at the mandatory age of 70. Although retired, O‚ÄôDunne was said to have remained active in legal affairs. O‚ÄôDunne's career as a judge on the Supreme Bench of Baltimore was filled with many ups and downs. There were times in his career that he felt as though he was being ‚Äòmuzzled‚Äô, and was never permitted to fully express his opinions. During his time spent as a judge on the Supreme Bench of Baltimore he was considered a fearless and fair leader in the judicial system. He was both respected and feared by the citizens of Baltimore and the members of the legal community alike. During his forty-five years as a judge he helped clean up many aspects of the legal system including, but not limited to; fixing the penal establishment, abolishing the ancient Black Hand of the Justices of the Peace, reorganizing the state's legal business, and attacking on the old fee system. His most well-known court decision was made in the case of The University of Maryland v. Donald G. Murray, where he ruled in the favor of Donald G. Murray and started the movement that ended the discrimination against African-Americans applying to law schools in Maryland. He also was responsible for the desegregation of golf courses in the city of Baltimore; as long as the member dues were paid color was not to be a factor of who was allowed. He was known for his harsh sentences on minor criminal offences, such as robbery, but was not as harsh on those individuals that back talked and police, later being accused of disturbing the peace. He constantly fought corrupt members of the police department, lazy judges, and the press just to name a few. O'Dunne's main goal was to keep the streets safe and free of any criminal behavior regardless of its degree of offence, but would become highly irritated with those police officers that tried to wrongfully accuse a man of a crime. After his retirement in 1945 at the age of seventy, he still continued to actively follow the legal issues of the city. One noted incident he took great interest in was the escape of Maryland State Penitentiary inmate, Joseph Holmes. When he received word that Holmes had escaped most would have expected him to believe along the lines that, \\"justice must prevail\\", since he had spent many years as a Supreme Bench justice with that mentality. Instead he shocked the public with a quote from Shakespeare's Othello, \\"I do perceive here a divided duty‚Ä¶\\" and continued to look at the prisoners escape as not a bad, but a good thing. Eugene O'Dunne spent twenty years of his life as a judge for the city of Baltimore in hopes of ridding the city of crime. During that time he made many friends and just as many enemies, but those who were a part of the legal system during O‚ÄôDunne's years as a judge for the city of the Baltimore would all agree he was most certainly the most memorable judge of his time.\\"University of Maryland v.

He also taught criminal law and medical jurisprudence at the University of Maryland, Johns Hopkins and the University of Baltimore. In retirement O'Dunne practiced law with one of his sons and worked as a public relations counsel for the local liquor industry.http://www.msa.md.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/012400/012496/html/12496bio.htmlReport of the Maryland State Bar Association Mid-Winter Meeting; January 23, 1960, pp 18-20 References  Category:American judges Category:Lawyers from Tucson, Arizona Category:1875 births Category:1959 deaths Category:Belmont Abbey College alumni Category:University of Maryland, College Park alumni ","title":"Eugene O'Dunne"},{"id":"20296463","text":"Wachusett Reef as \\"Wachusett Bank\\" on 1904 map of Antarctica Historic Antarctic map of 1912 with \\"Wachusett Untiefe\\" Captain Lambert of the ship Wachusett reported that on June 4, 1899 he passed over a reef which appeared to be of coral formation in approximately latitude .

Stapleton made his first appearance for the team during the 2007 Waterford Crystal Cup and has become a regular player over the last few seasons. During that time he has won two All-Ireland winners' medals and six Munster winners' medals. At club level Stapleton is a three-time North Tipperary medalist with Borris-Ileigh. He had the honour of captaining the side to victory over Nenagh √âire √ìg in the 2017 decider. Playing career Club Stapleton plays his club hurling with the Borris-Ileigh club and has enjoyed some success. After enjoying little success at underage levels, he graduated onto the senior team where he won North Tipperary county titles in 2005, 2007 and 2017. On 24/09/2017, Stapleton guided his club to their first Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship decider since 1988 having defeated Drom-Inch in the semi final. His side were subsequently defeated in the decider by Thurles Sarsfields. On 3 November 2019, Borris-Ileigh won their first Tipperary Championship since 1986 with a 1-15 to 1-12 win over Kiladangan in the final. Munster honours followed on 24 November 2019, when Stapleton and his Borris-Ileigh teammates, against the odds, defeated Ballygunner to claim the club' s second Munster Club title and first since 1986. Minor & under-21 Stapleton first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Tipperary minor hurling team in 2003. He collected a Munster winners' medal that year following a 2-12 to 0-16 defeat of Cork. Stapleton's side, however, were later defeated by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Three years later in 2006 Stapleton was a key fixture on the Tipperary under-21 hurling team. He was in his final year on the team when he secured a Munster winners' medal in that grade following a 3-11 to 0-13 defeat of Cork. Tipp were later qualified for the All-Ireland final against Kilkenny. After a thrilling 2-14 apiece draw, both sides met for a replay which Kilkenny narrowly won by 1-11 to 0-11. Senior Stapleton made his senior competitive debut for Tipperary against Waterford in the pre-season Waterford Crystal Cup in 2006. He made his National Hurling League debut against Limerick in 2008, coming on as a substitute. He remained a fringe player for the next few years, coming on as a blood substitute in the All-Ireland semi-final defeat by Waterford in 2008 to make his Championship debut. In 2009 Stapleton was included on Tipperary's championship starting fifteen for the very first time against Cork. He won his first Munster medal that year as Tipp defeated Waterford by 4-14 to 2-16. After a six-week lay-off and a facile semi-final win over Limerick, a game which saw Stapleton pick up the man of the match award, Tipp qualified for an All-Ireland final meeting with Kilkenny. For much of the match it looked as if Tipp would pull off a shock and deny 'the Cats' a record-equaling four-in-a- row. Two quick goals in the space of a minute, one from a penalty by Henry Shefflin, sealed a 2-22 to 0-23 victory and defeat for Tipperary. Following the completion of the championship Stapleton was nominated for the All Star Team and Opel Gaelic Players' Association Team of the Year. Stapleton remained as Tipperary's first-choice right corner-back once again in 2010. After surrendering their Munster title to Cork, Tipperray regrouped in the qualifiers and reached a second successive All-Ireland decider. Kilkenny, a team chasing a fifth successive championship, provided the opposition and a great game was expected. Tipperary got off to a great start which was bolstered by an early Lar Corbett goal. He subsequently completed a hat-trick of goals and Tipperary had a fourth by Noel McGrath to deny Kilkenny's drive- for-five and secure a remarkable and convincing 4-17 to 1-18 victory. It was Stapleton's first All-Ireland winners' medal. Tipperary returned as provincial kingpins once again in 2011. A 7-19 to 0-19 trouncing of Waterford in the southern decider gave Stapleton a second Munster medal. For the third successive year, Tipperary faced off against Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final, however, on this occasion Kilkenny were slight underdogs going up against the new champions. Kilkenny started quickly and never surrendered the lead in the 2-17 to 1-16 victory. In 2012 Stapleton lost his place on Tipperary's starting fifteen. On 22 November 2016, Stapleton announced his retirement from inter-county hurling. In a statement he said \\" Following ten wonderful years playing senior hurling for Tipperary since first being called up by Babs Keating in 2006, which had until then been a lifelong dream, I wish to announce my retirement from the inter-county scene, I wish to thank my family, especially my parents Patricia and John, for all the positivity and advice through the years and also to my partner Jozette and close friends for supporting me always, particularly when I had injury setbacks. I owe a huge gratitude of thanks to the Principal and my fellow staff members of Col√°iste Mhuire Co-Ed Secondary School, Thurles, who facilitated me in any way they could during my time with the county.\\" Honours Team ;Borris-Ileigh *Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship (1): 2019 *Tipperary Senior Hurling Championship (1): 2019 *North Tipperary Senior Club Hurling Championship (3): 2005, 2007, 2017 ;Tipperary *All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (2): 2010, 2016 *Munster Senior Hurling Championship (6): 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016 *National Hurling League (1): 2008 *Waterford Crystal Cup (2): 2007, 2014 *Munster Under-21 Hurling Championship (1): 2006 *Munster Minor Hurling Championship (1): 2003 ;Individual *GAA GPA All Stars Awards Nomination (3): 2009, 2010, 2014 References Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Borris-Ileigh hurlers Category:Tipperary inter-county hurlers Category:All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners ","title":"Paddy Stapleton"},{"id":"20296505","text":"Biggleswade Rugby Club is a rugby union team from Bedfordshire.

SAROPS has three main components: The Graphical User Interface (GUI), the Environmental Data Server (EDS) and the Simulator (SIM). Using the Commercial Joint Mapping Tool Kit's (C/JMTK) government licensing of the Geographic Information System (GIS) SAROPS can be used in both a coastal and oceanic environment. Built into the simulator is the ability to access global and regional wind and current data sets making SAROPS the most comprehensive and powerful tool available for maritime SAR planners.User manual for USCG SAROPS. (2006). (1.0.0 ed.): Northrop Grumman Mission Systems Historical search planning tools Prior to SAROPS, SAR controllers in the U.S. Coast Guard used the Computer Assisted Search Planning (CASP) and Joint Automated Work Sheets (JAWS), which used dated search planning techniques and algorithms. More specifically, CASP was based on old computing technology and JAWS was taken directly from pen and pencil techniques for shorter durations of drift in coastal environments. Environmental data consisted of low-resolution (1-degree latitude/longitude grid) wind and current information that was applied every 12 hours. For most areas, CASP used monthly-averaged current values while JAWS used one wind and current value during the SAR case.Turner, C., Lewandowski, S., Lester, D., Mack, E., Howlett, M., Spaulding, E., Comerma, M.

Retrieved on 18 Nov 2008 from http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg9/rdc/default.asp?page=latest.asp&rn;=off Neither system was capable of accessing timely high-resolution wind nor current model output, which was a significant disadvantage since one of the main components that determine the accuracy of the drift solution is the presence of precise and accurate wind and current information for the given area of interest.U.S. Coast Guard Addendum to the United States National SAR Supplement. (2006). Retrieved 23 January 2008 from http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-o/g-opr/manuals/manuals.htm. Motivation for the development of SAROPS  The U.S. Coast Guard uses a systematic approach for search and rescue operations. There are five SAR stages for any case: Awareness, Initial Actions, Planning, Operations and Conclusions. Upon becoming aware of a case from a \\"MAYDAY\\" call or other form of communication, SAR controllers work to gather data about the case and more often than not, there are many uncertainties in the initial report. The controller, then, must develop a search area based upon the information, estimate resource availability and capability, promulgate the search plan and deploy the resources. While the assets are conducting a search, the controller begins the process again by gathering additional information, developing a subsequent search, deploying resources and evaluating previous searches. This process continues until the survivors are found and rescued or proper authorities suspend the SAR case. Consequently, there is a need for a tool that is fast, simple, minimizes data entry, minimizes potential for error, can access high- resolution environmental data, and create search action plans that maximize the probability of success. Furthermore, the National Search and Rescue Plan of the United States (2007), challenges search and rescue communities in the following passage: > Recognizing the critical importance of reduced response time in successful > rescue and similar efforts, a continual focus will be maintained on > developing and implementing means to reduce the time required for: a. > Receiving alerts and information associated with distress situations; > b.

If this is not motivation enough, a USCG rotary-wing aircraft costs $9‚Äì14K per hour and a USCG cutter costs $3‚Äì15K per hour to operate.COAST GUARD REIMBURSABLE STANDARD RATES. (2008). COMMANDANT INSTRUCTION 7310.1L. Retrieved 18 November 2008 from http://www.uscg.mil/directives/listing_ci.asp?id=7000-7999 Reducing the time an aircraft is airborne or a cutter is in a search area can considerably reduce taxpayer costs as well as save lives and property. The U.S. Coast Guard contracted Northrop Grumman Corporation, Applied Science Associates (ASA), and Metron Inc., to develop a comprehensive system that included the latest graphical divergence parameters, Leeway divergence parameters, and Monte Carlo methods to improve the probability of success of search cases. SAROPS meets and exceeds these expectations by minimize planning and response time frames. SAROPS components SAROPS is made up of the Graphical User Interface (GUI), the Environmental Data Server (EDS) and the Simulator (SIM). Graphical User Interface (GUI) The Graphical User Interface uses the Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) Geographic Information System (ArcGIS) and has been altered to include U.S. Coast Guard specific applications such as the SAR Tools Extension and SAROPS Extension. The applications have a wizard-based interface and work within the ArcGIS layered environment. Vector and raster charts are available for display as well as search plans, search patterns, search area environmental data, and probability maps. Finally, the GUI provides reports on all search operations. Environmental Data Server (EDS) The Environmental Data Server (EDS) collects and stores environmental information for use within SAROPS. Local SAROPS servers around the United States request environmental information from the EDS based upon the area of interest. Different environmental products are cataloged on the server ranging from observational systems to modeling products. Observations include sea surface temperature, air temperature, visibility, wave height, global/region tides and currents to name a few. High-resolution model output from operational forecast models like the hybrid coordinate ocean model (HYCOM) and Global NRL Coastal Ocean (NCOM) provide temporally and spatially varying wind and current information. Lastly, the EDS is capable of providing objective analysis tools and aggregation. The list of available products is always changing as researchers in the Navy, local universities and research centers continually improve the accuracy and reliability of products and make them available on a consistent basis. SAROPS Simulator (SIM) =Definitions= * Probability of Containment (POC): The likelihood of the search object being contained within the boundaries of some area. It is possible to achieve 100% POC by making the area larger and larger until all possible locations are covered. * Probability of Detection (POD): The likelihood of detecting an object or recognizing the search object. Different aircraft, environmental conditions and search object types can give a different probability of detection. Generally, the probability of detection decreases with increasing distance from the search object. * Probability of Success (POS): The likelihood that a search object will be found. POS depends upon the POC and the POD. POS = POC x POD Soza & Company, Ltd. (1996). The Theory of Search: A Simplified Explanation: U.S. Coast Guard. Contract Number: DTCG23-95-D-HMS026. Retrieved on 2010-07-18 from http://cgauxsurfaceops.us/documents/TheTheoryofSearch.pdf =Simulator Wizard= The simulator wizard makes use of multiple pages of scenario descriptions that are entered by the user in order to compute the possible distress positions and times, subsequent search object drift trajectories, and the effect of completed searches on the search object probabilities. The simulator captures uncertainty in positions, time environmental inputs and leeway parameters. Upon receiving all of the information pertinent to the case, the simulator, using Markov's Monte Carlo method, simulates the drift of up to 10,000 particles for each scenario. For every 20 minutes of drift, the simulator accounts for changes in water current, wind leeway and leeway divergence. The simulator displays the results as a probability density map that can be animated over the drift duration. Figure 1 depicts this type of map. The ensemble trajectory model, random walk and random flight model governing equations are fully explained in Breivik and Allen (2008) and Spaulding, et al. (2005) that is located within O'Donnell, et al. (2005).Breivik, O., Allen, A. (2008). An Operational Search and Rescue Model for the Norwegian Sea and the North Sea.

Retrieved 23 January 2008 from http://www.rdc.uscg.gov In short, the goal of the simulator is to maximize the probability of success. =Optimal Planning Wizard= The optimal planning wizard takes the probability map information as well as another set of user inputs such as the type of resources, on scene conditions and sweep width values to develop search areas that maximize the POS. The search areas can be adjusted by the SAR controller to further maximize POS. Armed with the best possible fit given available resources, the SAR controller can then transmit the search pattern to the search assets. If the search object is not found on the first search, the optimal planning wizard will account for previous unsuccessful searches when recommending subsequent searches. Applications outside of search and rescue SAROPS may be expanded to include other applications outside of search and rescue. These applications may include but are not limited to the projection of fisheries stocks and oil spill projections. Real world use SAROPS was utilized in the response to the Deepwater Horizon explosion and assisted in the ultimate recovery of 115 persons.http://www.deepwaterinvestigation.com/go/doc/3043/621903/ References  External links  * Software for SAR patterns in GPX - Navigational Algorithms Manual Category:Emergency services in the United States Category:United States Coast Guard Category:Disaster management tools ","title":"Search and Rescue Optimal Planning System"},{"id":"20296665","text":"Donald C. Johnson (born 1949) is an American career diplomat who served as U.S. Ambassador to three countries; Equatorial Guinea, Cape Verde and Mongolia. Early life and education Johnson grew up in Mexico. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Lewis & Clark College and his J.D. from Lewis & Clark Law School. He earned a Master of Public Administration from the University of Oklahoma in 1975. He received his LL.M in corporation law from the George Washington University Law School.  Career  Johnson entered the United States Foreign Service in 1974. His first post was as Third Secretary in Guatemala. Other overseas postings have been in Moscow, Taipei, Beijing, Madrid, and Tegucigalpa. Domestic assignments include service as a Desk Officer at the State Department and service on the National Security Council at the White House. Career highlights include earthquake relief in Guatemala; liaison with human rights groups in the former Soviet Union; ; negotiation of drug control and status of forces agreements in Honduras. Before becoming U.S. Ambassador to Mongolia (1993‚Äì1996), Johnson had traveled to Ulaanbaatar before the U.S. had established diplomatic relations. He was also instrumental in concluding numerous trade and scientific agreements during his tenure. From 1996 to 1997 he was Head of Mission in Moldova for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Between 1997 and 1999 he was one of three members of the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning during the Northern Ireland peace process. While serving on the Commission, he led the team that carried out the very first voluntary decommissioning of paramilitary weapons in Northern Ireland, which saw the destruction of submachine guns, handguns, ammunition and improvised explosives. From 2002 to 2005 he served as U.S. Ambassador to Cape Verde. During his service, Cape Verde was one of the first 16 countries to qualify for the Millennium Challenge Account, and prior to the completion of his Cape Verde assignment, Cape Verde signed a $110 million Compact with the Millennium Challenge Corporation to fund major infrastructure and water improvements. In addition, Cape Verde became only the sixth country in Africa to achieve Category 1 status for its civil aviation, and in July 2005, Cape Verde‚Äôs airline began direct flights to the U.S. From the fall of 2005 until June 2006, Ambassador Johnson worked in the U.S. Mission to the Organization of American States, leading the U.S. team in the negotiations for a Social Charter of the Americas.

Additionally, further 468 exotic species have been recorded as adventitious or naturalized in more recent times. Geobotanically, the Italian flora is shared between the Circumboreal Region and Mediterranean Region. According to the index compiled by the Italian Ministry for the Environment in 2001, 274 vascular plant species were protected. Goeological map of Italy  Geography Italy consists of a 1,000 km (620 miles) long peninsula extending out into the central Mediterranean, together with a number of islands to the south and west. The Apennines run north-south through the peninsula connecting the Alps in the north to Etna and the Peloritani mountains in Sicily in the south. The geology is diverse. Northern Italy is dominated by the Alps and an extensive valley of the Po river which is extensively agricultural and industrialised. Central Italy includes the regions of Tuscany, Umbria, Marche and Lazio. It is dominated by the Apennines, from which a few major rivers flow. There are few natural plains. A process of land reclamation has replaced the coastal swamps and marshes with agricultural land. Southern Italy includes the regions of Abruzzo, Molise, Apulia, Basilicata and Campania. Agriculture and industry are less developed. The main islands are Sicily, Sardinia and the Aeolian Islands. Each region has a distinct flora. Ecoregions An ecoregion is an ecologically and geographically defined area with characteristic natural communities and species. Different ecoregions are distinguished by different vegetation features. In Italy Carlo Blasi et al. identified and mapped two divisions (Temperate and Mediterranean), 13 provinces, 33 sections and approximately 80 subsections. Each unit has an alphanumeric code that indicates its hierarchical level and a full name that indicates its geographic location and main diagnostic factor.Carlo Blasi, Giulia Capotorti, Daniela Smiraglia, Domenico Guida, Laura Zavattero, Barbara Mollo, Raffaella Frondoni, and Riccardo Copiz A thematic contribution to the National Biodiversity Strategy - The ecoregions of Italy The Temperate Division includes the Alps, the Po Plain, and most of the Apennines. It accounts for 64% of Italy. This area is characterized by almost absent summer aridity and by marked differences between summer and winter temperatures. The natural vegetation mainly consists of forests, with broad-leaved deciduous plants (Quercus, Fagus and Carpinus species). The Mediterranean Division includes the southern Apennines, the Tyrrhenian and Ionian coasts, the southern Adriatic coast and the Islands. It accounts for almost 36% of the Italian territory. This area is characterized by summer aridity, with precipitations concentrated in autumn and winter. The natural vegetation mainly consists of mixed woods of evergreen and deciduous species, shrublands and Mediterranean maquis. The floral composition The native vegetation of Italy reflects the diversity of the physical environment: the differences in geology, the differences of altitude above sea level and the diversity of the climate between the continental and the peninsular Italy, that give rise to various phytoclimatic areas. The peninsula and islands are dominated by the characteristics of the Mediterranean climate, with mild and rainy winters and very warm and dry summers. On the contrary, the north of Italy has lower temperatures in winter and a more uniform distribution of rainfall during the summer. The species of plants present in Italy belong to the flora of the continental Europe or to the Mediterranean flora. In some cases Western species can be distinguished (e.g. the hornbeam, limited to Western Europe) and eastern species (e.g. the oriental hornbeam, present in Eastern Europe). The last Ice Age, the W√ºrm Glaciation, in the Alps ended about 12,000 years ago, and one can still recognize its influence on vegetation, in particular by means of glacial relict species. A well known example is the Etna birch (Betula aetniensis), driven in Sicily at a time when the climate was much colder. Broadly there are three different vegetational zones of forests or bushes in Italy: 1\\\\. evergreen vegetation: maquis shrubland (Italian: macchia mediterranea) with densely growing plants and shrubs that always have leaves on. This flora is typical of the dry mediterranean climate, especially along the coast and in the islands. The most common plants are olives (Olea europaea), agrumes (Citrus species), maritime pines (Pinus pinaster), cork oaks (Quercus suber), holm oak, carrubo (Ceratonia siliqua), myrtles (Myrtus communis), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), sage, junipers (Juniperus communis, tree heath and bay laurel (Laurus nobilis).(Mediterranean South) 2\\\\. broad-leaved vegetation (oaks, beeches, chestnuts): it is typical of the mountain region with a humid climate (Apennines and Prealps). Temperate. The most common plants are Castanea sativa, Fagus sylvatica, the relicts Pinus mugo and Pinus nigra var. italica, Sorbus chamaemespilus, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, and Vaccinium vitis-idaea. There are also a high number of endemic species increasing at higher elevations. Alpine species include Gentiana nivalis, Androsace alpina, Polygala chamaebuxus, Saxifraga oppositifolia and Carlina acaulis. 3\\\\. coniferous vegetation (larches, pines, firs): it is an evergreen vegetation typical of the Alps and of a few high Apennines areas. Temperate. The most common plants present in this phytoclimatic area are Picea abies, Abies alba, Larix decidua, Pinus sylvestris, Pinus nigra, Pinus cembra and Pinus mugo. In the Po Basin can be found mixed forests that include mixed deciduous oak/hornbeam forests (Quercus robur, Quercus cerris, Carpinus betulus, Ulmus minor, Fraxinus ornus) and Riparian forest, as well as flood-plain vegetation of the Po Basin (Fraxinus oxycarpa, Salix alba, Alnus glutinosa, Ulmus minor, Populus alba, Populus nigra, Quercus robur). There are also plant associations almost treeless: grasslands, pastures, deserts. In the mountains, gradually, the forest turns in mountain pastures, scattered in various shrubs (e.g. pinus mugo, rhododendrons, junipers) and dotted with small colorful flowers. Higher up are the montane grasslands and even areas similar to a desert because they have no or almost no vegetation (rocks, glaciers). Species richness in Southern Europe Italy has around 6,711 (6,759) species of vascular plants (Conti et al., 2005 An inventory of vascular plants endemic to Italy), preceded only by the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands with around 7,500 vascular plant taxa (species and subspecies) (Castroviejo 2010 Flora Iberica). In Greece, the number of species is around 5,700 (Strid and Tan, 1997 Flora Hellenica) and in France, there are 4,630 species (Walter and Gillett, 1998 1997 IUCN red list of threatened plants). Per unit area Greece is the country with the highest concentration of native plant species. Endemic species Italy has 1371 endemic species and subspecies (18.9% of the total vascular flora).Lorenzo Peruzzi. Fabio Conti and Fabrizio Bartolucci An inventory of vascular plants endemic to Italy Threats Habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation are the most significant threats to plant species that occur in Italy. Also changing water flow patterns and over-extraction, increasing droughts due to climate change, pollution and the introduction of alien species threaten the flora. Other threats come from farming (as a result of agricultural expansion and intensification), urbanization and tourism.Italy‚Äôs biodiversity at risk IUCN The cultivation of plants that give textile fibers (Cannabis sativa, Linum usitatissimum), the cultivation of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), cereals, potatoes, orchards, vineyards and olive groves have almost replaced the natural vegetation. The actions of man since Roman times have resulted in the destruction of most of the lowland forests and hills, the expansion of pastures, and the extinction of many species and in the introduction of exotic species which are then naturalized. For example, the Indian fig opuntia (Opuntia ficus-indica), is now common in the warmer parts of the Southern Italy. Also, the invasive false Acacia (Robinia) is widely spread. Conservation Italy is a signatory to the Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats and the Habitats Directive both affording protection to the fauna and flora of Italy.

For several years, Gandy was the lead male model for Italian designers Dolce & Gabbana who featured him in their advertising campaigns and fashion shows. In an industry dominated by skinny models, Gandy's muscular build caused some menswear fashion designers to change standards. The increase in his popularity and name recognition resulted in a broad portfolio of magazine covers, editorial photo shoots, interviews and industry awards. He has gone on to participate in fashion-related and personal projects such as writing a blog for British Vogue, writing car reviews for British GQ, mobile app development and charity work.  Modelling career   Background  Gandy was born in Billericay, Essex. In his youth, Gandy wanted to be a veterinarian, but his grades were not high enough to meet the needed standards for that line of study. So, while studying multimedia computing, he went to work for Auto Express, delivering the latest Porsches and Jaguars to the track for testing. In 2001, while studying marketing at the University of Gloucestershire, Gandy's flatmate entered him (without his knowledge) into a modelling competition on ITV‚Äôs This Morning hosted by Richard and Judy. The 21-year-old Gandy won the competition, and the prize included a contract with Select Model Management in London. The following year, he left university a few modules shy of receiving his honours degree in order to pursue modeling full time. David Gandy for GQ Japan by Arnaldo Anaya-Lucca (2009)  Work  During the early years of his career, Gandy modelled for a variety of companies, including Shiatzy Chen, 7 for all Mankind, Zara, Marks & Spencer, Gant U.S.A., Hugo Boss, Russell & Bromley, H&M;, Carolina Herrera, Massimo Dutti and others. In 2006, he became the face of Dolce & Gabbana, annually starring in their apparel campaigns and fashion shows through 2011, working with female supermodels such as Gemma Ward, Scarlett Johansson, and Naomi Campbell as well as with male models including Noah Mills, Tony Ward, and Adam Senn. Gandy is best known for the 2007 advertising campaign for Dolce & Gabbana's fragrance \\"Light Blue\\" with Marija Vujovic (shot by photographer Mario Testino), which had 11 million online hits and included a 50-foot billboard of Gandy displayed in Times Square. He modelled for Dolce & Gabbana's 2008 calendar, shot by photographer Mariano Vivanco. Gandy returned as the face of the second \\"Light Blue\\" fragrance campaign for 2010, but this time with Anna Jagodzinska. He also made a short promotional film for W Hotels with Helena Christensen called \\"Away We Stay\\". In 2011, the fashion house published David Gandy by Dolce & Gabbana, a 280-page photographic coffee table book of images chronicling their years of collaboration. That same year, Gandy shot four magazine covers and five fashion editorial photoshoots. In 2012, he was featured on 16 magazine covers, appeared on 18 fashion editorials, and modelled for Banana Republic, Lucky Brand Jeans, El Palacio de Hierro, and Marks & Spencer. In addition, Gandy was named the brand ambassador for Johnnie Walker Blue Label. In 2013, Dolce & Gabbana released the third version of the \\"Light Blue\\" fragrance campaign, also featuring Gandy. Once again, Mario Testino filmed the adverts and commercial on location in the island of Capri, southern Italy, but this time with the Italian model Bianca Balti in the female role. Bionda Castana, a British shoe label, released a fashion film featuring Gandy called \\"David Gandy's Goodnight.\\" In it, he seduces several women who discover later that he has stolen their shoes. On 26 September, Gandy and Jaguar released a short film called \\"Escapism\\", which featured Gandy driving models such as the C-Type, the E-Type, the XKSS, and the new F-Type. In November, Marks & Spencer launched their 2013 Christmas advertising campaign, \\"Magic & Sparkle\\"; the fairy-tale-themed commercial featured Rosie Huntington-Whiteley with Helena Bonham Carter and Gandy.  Other endeavours   Fashion projects  2012 Olympics - British Models In May 2010, Gandy spoke at the University of Oxford Union as part of a panel that included photographer Tony McGee, Victoria & Albert Museum senior curator Claire Wilcox, fashion consultant Frances Card and Dolly Jones, the editor of British Vogue. He released the \\"David Gandy Men's Style Guide\\" mobile app in 2010 which offered style and clothing advice to men and which ultimately hit Top 3 in the Lifestyle market. In September 2011, Gandy was named the spokesman for the Martini‚Äôs \\"Luck Is An Attitude\\" campaign, launching their model-search competition on the Spanish Steps of Rome, which were opened specifically for the event. He was appointed to serve on the British Fashion Council's Committee to launch \\"London Collections: Men\\" as part of London Fashion Week 2012. During the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony, Gandy was the only male to walk the Union Jack-shaped catwalk featuring British fashions, alongside models Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Jourdan Dunn, Lily Donaldson, Georgia May Jagger, Karen Elson and Stella Tennant. For the occasion, he wore a gold bespoke suit by British designer Paul Smith.

Writing and other pursuits  David Gandy and Yasmin Le Bon - 2013 Mille MigliaSince February 2011, Gandy has regularly written a blog for British Vogue where he discusses his career, fashion/style, cars, antiques and life in London. He is also an official car reviewer for British GQ. In October 2011, London's Evening Standard invited Gandy to be guest writer/editor of their Men's Issue. His body has inspired fitness-industry interviews, exercise videos as well as his own fitness app which was released in December 2012. After receiving his racing license in 2012, Gandy was invited to be one of the drivers in the 2013 Mille Miglia (\\"1,000 Mile\\") race in Italy. Each year, the three-day event passes through nearly 200 Italian towns from Brescia to Rome and back, recreating the original races which took place between 1927 and 1957. He and his co-driver, Yasmin Le Bon, were part of \\"Team Jaguar\\", driving a 1950 XK120. Early in the race, Gandy and Le Bon were \\"pushed off the road by a competitor\\" which caused body damage to the fender and side of the vintage car. They re-entered the race, ultimately finishing in 158th place out of 415 cars. On 12 September 2013, The Daily Telegraph launched a new men's lifestyle section called \\"Telegraph Men\\". They announced that Gandy would be a contributing columnist.

It deals with a diverse set of political issues, including UN peacekeeping and peaceful uses of outer space. However, the issues of decolonization and the Middle East take up most of its time.  Mandate  When it was first created, the Fourth Committee was solely responsible for trusteeship- and decolonization-related matters. However, after independence was granted to all the United Nations trust territories and the subsequent dismantling of the trusteeship system, the Committee's workload decreased. Consequently, the Fourth Committee was merged with the Special Political Committee, which had been created as a seventh main committee to deal with certain political issues. The Fourth Committee deals with: decolonization-related items, the effects of atomic radiation, questions relating to information, a comprehensive review of the question of peacekeeping operations, review of special political missions, United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East, the report of the Special Committee on Israeli Practices and international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space.  Working Methods  The Fourth Committee meets every year from late September to mid- November, but also convenes briefly in the spring to adopt any resolutions and decisions relating to peacekeeping passed by the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. All 193 member states of the UN can attend its meetings. Unlike most other United Nations bodies, there is no general debate at the beginning of the Committee's work. The Committee also allows for petitioners, i.e. civil society representatives and other stakeholders, to address it on decolonization issues. Finally, the Committee usually adopts about 30-35 draft resolutions and several draft decisions annually, usually by consensus.  Reporting Bodies  The following bodies report through the Fourth Committee to the General Assembly: * Committee on Information * Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) * Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations (C-34) * Special Committee on Decolonization (C-24) * Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and other Arabs of the Occupied Territories * United Nations Relief and Works Agency for State of Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) * United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR)  Current state  In its 75th Session, the Committee will focus on: * Maintenance of international peace and security ** Effects of atomic radiation ** International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space ** United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ** Report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied Territories ** Comprehensive review of the whole question of peacekeeping operations in all their aspects ** Comprehensive review of special political missions ** Questions relating to information ** Information from Non-Self-Governing Territories transmitted under Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations ** Economic and other activities which affect the interests of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories ** Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples by the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations ** Offers by Member States of study and training facilities for inhabitants of Non-Self-Governing Territories ** Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples Bureau The following make up the bureau of the Fourth Committee for the 75th Session of the General Assembly: {  !

As a teenager, he continued to sing in the St. Peter Claver Church choir and performed in local school functions. When highly successful groups emerged on the scene, Da'Ville became inspired to create a group of his own.

He is the father of former driver David Reutimann. Reutimann was inducted into the Northeast Dirt Modified Hall of Fame in 1997 and the Eastern Motorsport Press Association Hall of Fame in 2006. Reutimann began working on race cars at age 13 despite his mother's protests. Primarily a Short track racer, he made one NASCAR start on November 11, 1962 in Tampa, Florida at Golden Gate Speedway. He started 18th and finished 10th in the event, which was considered part of the 1963 season. He was given the nickname \\"Buzzie\\" at birth after several nurses noticed he made buzzing sounds as an infant. He drove the number #00, and so did his son David in the Sprint Cup Series. In 1972 Reutimann won the dirt modified track championship at the Orange County Fair Speedway in Middletown, New York. That same year he captured the win at the prestigious Eastern States 200. Now in his seventies, Reutimann continues to race and win to this day. He competes weekly at East Bay Raceway Park in Tampa, Florida.

Quest provides factual, lifestyle, entertainment programmes and other imported material, as well as coverage of football. The channel is operated by Discovery, Inc.. History Launch In October 2008, Discovery announced that they would launch a channel on Freeview in early 2009, but without using the \\"Discovery\\" name. A placeholder appeared on Freeview channel 47 on 5 January 2009 and Tiscali TV channel 109 on 14 May 2009. Although the channel planned to launch on 14 May 2009 at 10am, after broadcasting a promo loop on the planned launch morning, at 10am the channel returned to displaying a \\"Coming soon\\" message. The Quest website displayed a message reading: \\"Regrettably we have made the decision to postpone the launch of Quest. Due to a number of commercial factors we have had to make this difficult decision. We did not make this decision lightly and we are working towards launching Quest in the near future. We would like to apologise wholeheartedly to any of you that have been looking forward to this launch.\\" In August 2009, Discovery Networks announced that it planned to launch the channel on 30 September 2009. At the same time the channel moved to channel 38. Quest launched on Sky, on 1 October 2009, after acquiring an EPG slot from Information TV 2. Quest +1 launched on Sky, replacing DMAX +1.5 on 2 November 2009. Quest launched on Virgin Media on 25 March 2010 on channel 179. Quest moved to channel 12 on Freeview, a space previously occupied by Dave, due to its owner Discovery, Inc. acquiring Good Food, Home and Really from the UKTV network (which owns Dave) as part of a deal with BBC Studios. Quest HD is available on Swisscom TV (IPTV) in Switzerland since November 2019 Notable features It is notable for cropping the top and bottom from 4:3 programming in order to make it 16:9. Furthermore, if the channel is viewed with a receiver set to 4:3, the sides are cropped from the image (including cutting the channel logo in half) meaning only the very centre of the original picture is viewable. Full-time On 15 October 2010, Quest began broadcasting a 24-hour schedule on all platforms except Freeview. On 30 June 2011, Gems TV acquired a 24-hour Freeview stream, ending their timeshare with Quest, allowing Quest to begin broadcasting for 24 hours a day on Freeview as well. Quest +1 on Freeview At the beginning of March 2014, Quest +1 appeared on Freeview channel 57. On 27 May 2014, Quest moved on Freeview to channel 37 and Quest +1 moved to channel 38. On 15 March 2017 it moved to channel 92 due to the launch of sister channel Quest Red, and later channel 76 following closures. Quest +1 and Quest Red +1 received changes in 2019 as Quest Red +1 moved to 72 while Quest +1 increased broadcast hours to 24 hour rather than 7pm to 7am. Sports coverage On 21 July 2014, Quest announced that they would be broadcasting live football in the form of the 2014 Schalke 04 Cup - a pre-season tournament featuring the likes of Newcastle United F.C. and West Ham United F.C. Five months later the channel broadcast live coverage of the Dubai Challenge Cup. Speedway highlights are also shown on Quest. Since 2016, Quest has showed coverage of the British Superbike Championship live, free-to- air. Originally, it was to avoid a clash with other events being shown on Eurosport's normal broadcast channels, but subsequently the event has regularly been shown on the channel either live or by highlights. In late 2016, Quest broadcast live coverage and highlights of the new Home Series International Snooker Series, Quest broadcast afternoon sessions live of the English, Scottish and Northern Irish Opens with evening coverage exclusively on Eurosport and highlights. Both Eurosport & Quest cover the final sessions of each tournament live. The coverage is presented by Andy Goldstein or Colin Murray alongside Jimmy White, Neal Foulds & Ronnie O'Sullivan with commentary by the usual Eurosport commentators Joe Johnson, Neal Foulds, Dave Hendon & Philip Studd. Since 5 January 2019, Quest has shown live coverage and highlights of the BDO World Darts Championship, BDO World Trophy and the World Masters. Quest shares coverage with sister channel Eurosport. Quest also shows parts of the 24 Hours of Le Mans each year along with its sister channels Eurosport 1 and Eurosport 2 and also broadcasts highlights of the MotoGP World Championship along with Moto2 and Moto3 beginning from 2019. =English Football League (EFL)= Kicking-off from the 2018‚Äì19 season, the four-year deal will see Quest provide 90 minutes of extensive match highlights of the English Championship, League One and League Two, hosted by Colin Murray, in primetime at 9pm every Saturday night. As a result, the channel announced a HD version would launch in July 2018. It launched on 21 July 2018 on Virgin Media channel 217 but was removed on 24 July 2018. It officially launched on 2 August 2018 on Virgin Media, on 3 August on Freesat and Sky, and on 14 August on Freeview. The EFL said in its news release on 4 May 2018 that \\"the partnership between the EFL and Quest will guarantee accessible high quality, free-to-air coverage for football fans across the country\\". When the first show was broadcast on 4 August 2018, viewers experienced frequent breakup of picture and the screen aspect was reduced to the obsolete 4:3 ratio. Numerous complaints were made and DigitalSpy ran a feature on the impact of the \\"technical difficulties\\". Quest claimed that \\"some\\" viewers experienced problems but the DigitalSpy investigation strongly suggests that everyone was impacted. Quest added that they were working to resolve the issue. Sky channel moves On 17 October 2013, Quest moved from 154 to 167 on Sky, while TLC +1 moved from 195 to 154, and Quest +1 moved from 167 to 195. On 16 July 2015, Quest moved from 167 to 144 on Sky, switching places with sister channel DMAX. Quest and Quest Red removed their encryption and began broadcasting free-to-air on satellite in June 2017, and were added to the Freesat guide early in July. As part of Sky's major EPG reshuffle on 1 May 2018, Quest +1 moved from channel 195 to 244 (due to Quest not moving from channel 144).

She saw service in the later stages of World War II and was decommissioned postwar. She then was transferred to the United States Coast Guard and was in commission as the Coast Guard cutter USCGC Barataria (WAVP-381), later WHEC-381 from 1949 to 1969, serving in the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War during her lengthy Coast Guard career. Construction, commissioning, and shakedown USS Barataria (AVP-33) is launched on 2 October 1943 at Lake Washington Shipyard, Houghton, Washington.Barataria was laid down on 19 April 1943 at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard. She was launched on 2 October 1943, sponsored by Mrs. L. J. Stetcher, and commissioned at her builder's yard on 13 August 1944 with Commander Garrett S. Coleman in command. After having spent the remainder of August 1944 in outfitting, loading supplies, and testing and calibrating equipment, Barataria conducted training in tending seaplanes under the auspices of Fleet Air Wing (FAW) 6 at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island at Oak Harbor, Washington. Concluding that training in early September 1944, the ship spent 10 September 1944 through 10 October 1944 in gunnery exercises, casualty drills, sonar training, a speed run, combat information center exercises, and in more seaplane tending operations. Upon completion of the shakedown, she returned to the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton, Washington, for post-shakedown availability and alterations. United States Navy service World War II service =Voyage to the Western Pacific= Early in November 1944, Barataria stood out of Bremerton, bound for San Francisco, California, where she took on stores, aircraft maintenance spares, aviation gasoline, and supplies and embarked 39 officers as passengers. She then stood out of San Francisco Bay, bound for Hawaii. Reaching Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 28 November 1944, she got underway again on 30 November 1944 and proceeded independently to Eniwetok, which she reached on 7 December 1944. After embarking passengers, Barataria continued again independently to Ulithi Atoll, where she arrived on 12 December 1944, and later fueled from the tanker Octorance. =The Philippines campaign= Departing from Ulithi as escort and lead ship of a five-ship convoy, Barataria reached the Philippines on 22 December 1944. She spent the remainder of December 1944 and the first few days of January 1945 anchored off Leyte in the San Juanico Strait tending Patrol Bomber Squadron 25 (VPB-25), consisting of 15 Martin PBM-3D Mariner flying boats, whose mission was to conduct daylight searches north and east of Luzon. Shifting to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 5 January 1945, Barataria got underway on 6 January 1945 as a screen for the seaplane tender USS Currituck (AV-7) and rendezvoused with Task Force 79 carrying the San Fabian assault forces. Two aircraft rescue boats (ARBs) had been assigned to Barataria, but one of these began taking on water and had to be abandoned and sunk on 8 January 1945. When several kamikaze suicide planes attacked the convoy later that day, Baratarias gunners claimed a \\"sure assist\\" for downing one. On the morning of 9 January 1945, Barataria, joined by Currituck, left the convoy and proceeded to eastern Lingayen Gulf, where Barataria planted seaplane moorings, anchors, and buoys in the shallow waters south of Aringay Point. That afternoon, the planes of Patrol Bomber Squadron 20 (VPB-20) arrived and moored, and Baritaria carried out routine fueling operations for the remainder of the day. On the morning of 10 January 1945, Barataria surveyed the waters off the town of Damortis, south of Aringay Point, and found them free of swells. This information prompted her to move to that area, where she anchored shortly after noon. As the patrol bombers of Patrol Bomber Squadron 17 (VPB-17) arrived that afternoon, one plane sank after a rough landing. Barataria rescued the crew and salvaged some gear. When Japanese mortar fire began falling around the ship at 16:23 hours, Barataria slipped her anchor chain and retired out of range. Meanwhile, one of her 5-inch (127 mm) guns fired nine rounds at the Japanese positions, silencing the mortar fire. After that, Baritaria returned to the anchorage. For the rest of January 1945, Barataria tended the Consolidated PBY-5A Catalinas of Patrol Bomber Squadron 71 (VPB-71) as they carried out nighttime \\"Black Cat\\" strikes against shore installations and shipping along the coast of China and conducted antisubmarine patrol missions. Based first at Cabalitan Bay and then at Sual Bay in southwestern Lingayen GuIf, she shared these seaplane tender duties with Currituck until Currituck departed on 27 January 1945. Barataria then spent from February 1945 to the first two weeks of March 1945 at Cabalitan Bay, establishing a seaplane ramp on the south shore of Cabalitan Island and continuing to tend the Catalinas of VPB-71 as they carried out night reconnaissance and attack missions. The PBM-3D Mariners of Patrol Bomber Squadron 28 (VPB-28) relieved VPB-71 on 28 February 1945 and continued the nocturnal missions begun by the PBYs. Transferring the seaplane tending duties for VPB-28 to the seaplane tender on 13 March 1945, Barataria stood out of Lingayen Gulf, bound via Subic Bay for Sangley Point, Luzon, and moored there on the morning of 18 March 1945. While at Sangley Point, Barataria serviced the planes of VPB 25, previously tended by the seaplane tender . The highlight of her service there began when she got underway at 11:16 hours on 26 March 1945 to rescue a VPB-28 plane downed in the South China Sea about off the coast of Luzon. Guided by search planes, Barataria arrived on the scene at 22:15 hours, lowered her motor whaleboat, and brought the plane crew on board while preparing to fuel the plane for a morning take off attempt or, that failing, to rig a tow. However, neither plan came to fruition. Instead, the destroyer , which ship arrived on the scene shortly after midnight to escort Barataria, sank the plane with gunfire after all classified gear had been removed from it. Barataria then returned to Sangley Point where she spent the remainder of March 1945. Underway again on 2 April 1945, Barataria headed for Mangarin Bay, Mindoro, to refuel and to replenish her supply of aviation gasoline, before proceeding to Cebu, where she anchored on 4 April 1944. Shifting to a berth off the city of Opon at Mactan Island on 5 April 1945, she there assumed the duties of station tender, Cebu. She surveyed Mactan Island for the establishment of a seaplane ramp and beach facilities, and laid out take off and landing areas in the waters offshore. She also established liaison with the United States Army Air Forces units ashore on both Mactan Island and Cebu. Meanwhile, the United States Army proceeded with the occupation of Cebu. With some isolated exceptions, the fighting centered on an area adjacent to Cebu City, with the \\"evident strong point being a high point, about three miles (5 km) north of the city\\"Quote is from Dictionary of American Naval Fightings Ships (see http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/b2/barataria-ii.htm) entry and is unattributed. identified as \\"Hill 25.\\" Army Artillery Control contacted Barataria on 11 April 1945 and asked her to \\"fire on any available targets.\\" Directed by Army spotters, Barataria expended 100 5-inch (127-mm) rounds over the course of two hours early on 11 April 1945 and shelled Hill 25 again on 12 April 1945, this time sending 75 5-inch (127-mm) rounds into the Japanese position. The Army spotters pronounced her firing \\"excellent\\". However, the action was not all one-sided for, at 05:40 hours on 14 April 1945, Barataria came under fire from Japanese 40- and 90-millimeter guns on Cebu Beach, directly opposite Mactan Island. Going to general quarters, she got underway and slipped her anchor cable, standing out of the north channel at 05:49 hours to lie to north of Mactan Island. She returned to her original anchorage later that morning, before moving to a berth in the southern part of Cebu Bay. Relieved by the seaplane tender on 21 April 1945, Barataria sailed for and anchored off Puerto Princessa, Palawan, on 22 April 1945. She then escorted the seaplane tender to Tawi Tawi on 24/25 April 1945, before proceeding on to Guiuan Harbor, Samar, late on the afternoon of 26 April 1945. After taking on board supplies there and fueling at San Pedro Bay, Barataria sailed for Mindoro and anchored in Mangarin Bay on the evening of 3 May 1945. Pushing on toward Lingayen Gulf, Barataria transferred aviation supplies to USS Tangier on 5 May 1945 before she relieved the seaplane tender on station at noon on 8 May 1945. In so doing, Barataria assumed charge of six planes from VPB-28 engaged in Lingayen Bay-based air-sea rescue operations. For the remainder of May 1945 and all of June 1945, she tended the PBM-5D Mariners of VPB-28 as they carried out \\"Dumbo\\" missions covering the Army's Fifth Air Force bombing strikes on Formosa. During May 1945, she also serviced the Royal Australian Air Force 76th Wing Detachments PBY Catalinas as an \\"intermediary landing point\\" in their minelaying operations off the China coast. Early in June 1945, Barataria provided air-sea rescue coverage for the movement of Marine Air Group 14 from Clark Field, Luzon, to Okinawa. Underway for Puerto Princessa on 8 July 1945, Barataria briefly tended planes of VPB-25, on standby for antisubmarine patrols, before she continued on via Manila, where she took on cargo bound for Puerto Princessa. She conducted tending operations at Puerto Princessa from 15/23 July 1944 before proceeding via Samar to Leyte. She next provided services for VPB-28 as it flew antisubmarine patrols out of Manila Bay, covering the waters adjacent to northern Luzon, for the remainder of World War II. =Honors and awards= Barataria earned one battle star for her World War II operations. Post-World War II With the end of the fighting on 15 August 1945 came new orders. Barataria cleared Subic Bay on 30 August 1945 bound for Okinawa. and arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, on 3 September 1945 after weathering a typhoon en route. After voyage repairs there, she shifted to Chimu Bay to tend the planes of VPB-17 and VPB-20 as they conducted passenger and mail flights. On 16 September 1945, another typhoon prompted Barataria to get underway to ride out the storm, getting all flyable planes aloft and off the rough seas. Baritaria clocked winds up to and seas up to 40 feet (12.2 m) high before she returned to port on 17 September 1945. Underway for the coast of China on 24 September 1945, Barataria reached Shanghai on 27 September 1945 and, for the remainder of September, tended the planes of VPB-17, which were flying mail and passengers in and out of Shanghai. Barataria later performed seaplane tending operations out of Jinsen (now Incheon), Korea. Decommissioning After completing her duties at Jinsen, Barataria returned to the United States for inactivation. She reached Seattle, Washington, on 29 December 1945. Decommissioned and placed in reserve on 24 July 1946, Barataria was laid up at Alameda, California. United States Coast Guard service thumb200pxleftUSCGC Barataria (WAVP-381), later WHEC-381, sometime prior to the United States Coast Guards 1967 adoption of the \\"racing stripe\\" markings on its ships. Barnegat-class ships were very reliable and seaworthy and had good habitability, and the United States Coast Guard viewed them as ideal for ocean station duty, in which they would perform weather reporting and search and rescue tasks, once they were modified by having a balloon shelter added aft and having oceanographic equipment, an oceanographic winch, and a hydrographic winch installed. After World War II, the Navy transferred 18 of the ships to the Coast Guard, in which they were known as the Casco-class cutters. After she been inactive for more than two years, the U.S. Navy loaned Barataria to the Coast Guard on 17 September 1948. After undergoing conversion for use as a weather-reporting ship, she was commissioned into Coast Guard service as USCGC Barataria (WAVP-381) on 10 January 1949. North Atlantic service 1949-1967 Barataria was stationed at Portland, Maine, on 1 August 1949, and it would remain her home port until January 1968. Her primary duty was to serve on ocean stations to gather meteorological data. While on duty in one of these stations, she was required to patrol a 210-square-mile (544-square-kilometer) area for three weeks at a time, leaving the area only when physically relieved by another Coast Guard cutter or in the case of a dire emergency. While on station, she acted as an aircraft check point at the point of no return, a relay point for messages from ships and aircraft, as a source of the latest weather information for passing aircraft, as a floating oceanographic laboratory, and as a search-and- rescue ship for downed aircraft and vessels in distress, and she engaged in law enforcement operations. Barataria patrolled the America's Cup Race at Newport, Rhode Island, in September 1962. When the Cuban Missile Crisis began in October 1962, Barataria was conducting an ocean station patrol on Ocean Station Echo in the shipping lanes east of Cuba. Barataria made contact with a Soviet freighter transporting a cargo of ballistic missiles and was ordered to shadow the freighter and await the arrival of a U.S. Navy warship which would conduct a boarding of the Soviet ship. Barataria remained at battle stations, Condition 2, and repeatedly attempted to establish communications with the Soviet ship. All attempts failed. A U.S. Navy destroyer based at Norfolk, Virginia, arrived and the Navy crew boarded the Soviet vessel. Barataria won the Commander Eastern Area Gunnery Excellence Award in 1963 and the Military Readiness Award in 1965. On 1 May 1966 she was reclassified as a high endurance cutter and redesignated WHEC-381. On 26 September 1966 her period on loan to the Coast Guard ended when she was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register and transferred permanently to the Coast Guard. Vietnam War service 1967-1968 On 1 April 1967, Barataria departed Portland, Maine, and moved to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. There she joined four other Casco-class Coast Guard cutters - , , and in forming Coast Guard Squadron Three. All five cutters were former Barnegat-class ships. Gresham became flagship of the squadron, which was designated Task Unit 70.8.6. Captain John E. Day, commander of the squadron, hoisted his pennant aboard Gresham upon activation of the squadron at Pearl Harbor on 24 April 1967. Coast Guard Squadron Three was tasked to operate in conjunction with U.S. Navy forces in Operation Market Time, the interdiction of North Vietnamese coastal arms and munitions traffic along the coastline of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The squadrons other Vietnam War duties included naval gun fire support for ground forces, resupplying Coast Guard and Navy patrol boats and search-and-rescue operations. The cutters departed Pearl Harbor on 26 April 1967 and reported to Commander, United States Seventh Fleet, for Market Time duty on 4 May 1967. They were joined by Navy radar picket destroyer escorts (DERs) of Escort Squadrons 5 and 7. USCGC Barataria (WHEC-381, ex-WAVP-381), entering San Francisco Bay in January 1968 as she returns from her Vietnam War service. The ten Market Time ships arrived at Subic Bay in the Philippines on 10 May 1967. The five Coast Guard cutters and five Navy destroyer escorts continuously manned four Market Time stations off Vietnam, while only Navy warships served on two Taiwan patrol stations. One ship rotated duty as the station ship in Hong Kong. During her Vietnam War tour, Barataria was underway 83 percent of the time and cruised over without a major mechanical or electrical failure. Keeping a close watch on all moving craft in her surveillance area, Barataria detected, inspected, or boarded nearly 1,000 steel-hulled vessels traversing her area, any one of which could have been a trawler trying to sneak supplies to the enemy. Barataria was called upon many times to use her main battery against enemy troops ashore who were engaged with allied forces; United States Army spotter planes reported all of Baratarias rounds on target, never once falling out of the target area. On one gunfire support mission, Barataria scored three direct hits on point targets which had been spotted by aircraft. Pacific service 1968-1969 Barataria returned to the United States on 12 January 1968 and was reassigned to San Francisco, California, which was her home port for the remainder of her Coast Guard career. She was used for law enforcement and search and rescue duties in the Pacific Ocean. On 24 March 1968, Barataria sustained an engine-room explosion off Unimak Island in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. From 21 May 1969 to 27 May 1969, Barataria rescued the crew of and stood by the Peruvian merchant ship Yavari southwest of San Francisco. Yavari sank before a salvage tug could arrive. Decommissioning and disposal The Coast Guard decommissioned Barataria on 29 August 1969. She was sold for scrapping in October 1970 to N.W. Kennedy Ltd. of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

The Georgia State University Library has two primary locations, Library North and Library South. In addition to hundreds of thousands of pieces of print media, the library also has online databases for electronic articles, as well as an electronic catalog for looking up media within the library‚Äôs many floors. The media found in the library includes novels, journals, newspapers, government documents, archives, DVDs, CDs, video tapes, audio cassette tapes, and periodicals. The University Library is located in the middle of Georgia State's main campus near Gilmer St. and Courtland St.  Collections  The library features over 1.5 million volumes which consist of 28,000 electronic journals, 2,800 periodicals over 820,000 government documents along with general texts. The Georgia State University Library includes 400 computer stations, 55 group study rooms, a quiet study room, and Saxbys Coffee Shop. The library is free and open to all Georgia State University Students, and costs $50 a year for the general public. The library also allows access to the GALILEO network which connects students to a much larger network of journals, periodicals, magazines, etc. through a system of online sources.  History  The Georgia State University Library, was established in 1948 as a branch of the University of Georgia Library. In 1951, the library purchased over 2,000 volumes from James Walter Mason. The original library staff only had three trained employees. After seven years of expansion, the library found a home in the second floor of Sparks Hall in 1955. The Sparks Hall facility contained a reading area and over 150,000 books. In comparison, the modern facility has its own building and is made up of multiple floors, and has more than ten times as much media as the Sparks Hall location had. The present Assembly Hall (registration) area on the second floor of Sparks Hall became the library's home in 1955. The library traces its origins to a number of books that Dr. George Sparks donated from his personal collection to the Georgia Tech Evening School of Commerce in downtown Atlanta. Additional donations followed and included the commerce library of Professor Wayne S. Kell and a collection of city reports owned by former mayor James S. Key. The library soon required a building of its own to house its burgeoning collections. The first phase of construction resulted in a two-story building, which was completed in 1966. Three additional floors were added to the new library building during the second phase of construction in 1968. The building was completed in 1969, and the surrounding plaza was eventually landscaped.  Special Collections and Archives  The Georgia State University Library also contains the Special Collections and Archives Department which collects and preserves rare historical materials in designated special subject areas. These are open to view by students and the public, but cannot be checked out. Unique records and artifacts in the trust of the Special Collections Department & Archives, Georgia State University Library, may be loaned for the purpose of exhibits to educational and cultural institutions.  Carl and Gretchen Patton Children's Collection  Carl Patton, once the president of Georgia State, and his wife Gretchen donated a large collection of children's books to the Library's existing children's section on the fourth floor of library north in 2003. The collection consists of about 13,000 titles. \\"The Pattons‚Äô gift represented an initial step toward raising $20 million to transform the main library into a 21st-century learning command central ‚Äî a place where students routinely gather to conduct research, work on group projects, receive tutoring, study and socialize.\\"  References  External links * Category:Georgia State University ","title":"Georgia State University Library"},{"id":"20297308","text":"The Motilon, or Bari, are an indigenous people who live in the Catatumbo River basin in Norte de Santander Department in Colombia in South America. They are descendants of the Tairona culture concentrated in northeastern Colombia and western Venezuela. Name Although the Bari and Yukpa peoples are commonly referred to as \\"Motilones,\\" this is not how they refer to themselves. \\"Motilones\\" means \\"shaved heads\\" in Spanish, and is how Spanish-speaking Colombians and Venezuelans refer to them. History In the 16th century, Alonso de Ojeda of Spain sailed to South Caribbean coasts and reached the Maracaibo Basin. The Spaniards believed that the area's frequent lightning strikes turned stone into gold, and so they began settling the region extensively. The Motilones fought the Spaniards back from their territory, defeating five royal expeditions sent to pacify the Indians. It was the Spaniards who first named the Bar√≠ \\"Motilones,\\" or \\"people of the short hair.\\" In 1530 Ambrosius Ehinger, commissioned by German banker family (Welser of Augsburg), looted a large amount of gold from the Kalina people on the western coast of South America, and attempted to transport the gold over the Bobal√≠ Mountains. Motilones ambushed and destroyed the expedition, and the gold was lost, never to be found again. In the 20th century, oil was discovered in Motilon territory, and as oil companies moved in, their land has been subjected to oil drilling from 1913‚Äì1926 and from 1996‚Äì2001. The first peaceful contact that was made with the Bari was by Roberto Lizarralde in 1960. Lizarralde conducted research among the Bari for 44 years and his research was carried on by his son, Manuel Lizarralde. The focus of their research has been on the ethnobotany of the Bari, who possess a vast knowledge of the biodiversity in Amazonia and use 80% of the plants around them. They have been the subject of the French ethnologist Robert Jaulin. The missionary Bruce Olson relates in his book, Bruchko, that he began living with the Bari in 1962, and he says that he became the \\"blood brother\\" of a chieftain's son. According to Olson, he is part of what he refers to as the \\"Motilone Miracle\\", which involves indigenously run schools, literacy programs, medical clinics, as well as an effort of the Motilone Bari to introduce Christianity to surrounding tribes.Olson, Bruce. Bruchko. Published by Charisma House, a Strang Company (2006) Since the initial contact in 1650, Bari land has been reduced to 7% of its original mass and the Bari have shifted their production to the gardening of cash crops in order to acquire Western goods which are becoming increasingly integrated into their culture. Economy The Motilon people's chief economic activity is the growing of Theobroma cacao, the plant from which chocolate is made. They export the cacao and use the proceeds to help maintain their network of schools, community centers, and health clinics, all started after large numbers of the Motilones (notably the chieftain, \\"Bobby\\") converted to Christianity, which resulted in a significant cultural shift. Language The Motilon speak the Bar√≠ language, part of the Chibchan language family. Beliefs Current estimates are that 70% of the Motilone people are Christians.http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php?rop3=106823&rog3;=VE ‚Äì Joshua project population estimates See also *Bruchko *Bruce Olson References Bibliography * Bruchko ‚Äì updated edition of the 1973 autobiography by Bruce Olson (link points to Amazon.com) * Bruchko and the Motilone Miracle ‚Äì 2006 sequel to Bruchko by Bruce Olson and James L.

Born in Groningen, Alting studied in his hometown and graduated in law. He left on 18 October 1750 for the East Indies on board the De Middelburg as an onderkoopman (underbuyer/undermerchant) for the Dutch East India Company (VOC). He spent the rest of his life in the Indies. In 1754 he became koopman (buyer/merchant) and in 1759 First Secretary to the government. In 1763 he became Counsellor-extraordinary (Buitengewoon Raad) and in 1772 full Counsellor (Raad ordinaris). In 1777, he became First Counsellor (Eerste Raad) was named Director-General. From March 1780 he was acting Governor- General, because of the sickness of his predecessor, Reynier de Klerck. Following the death of De Klerck, on 1 September 1780, he was chosen by the Dutch Council of the Indies as provisional Governor-General. He carried on this function for seventeen years. De Klerck had wanted to bring the use of Dutch into the educational system, but Alting revoked this in 1786, so that Malay and Portuguese were once again used. Alting's term of office was marked by a steep decline of the Dutch East India Company and its power in the Indies. Three months after he took up post, the Netherlands went to war with Great Britain (in the 1780‚Äì1784 Fourth Anglo-Dutch War) and a great part of the territory of Dutch East India Company was occupied by the British. The government in Batavia (Jakarta) did not, on the whole, offer much resistance. Following the 1784 Peace of Paris, Britain obtained the right to unhindered trade in the East Indies. The Dutch had to cede Negapatam in India to the British. The image of the Dutch in the eyes of the local rulers was thoroughly shattered. From the Netherlands, three Commissioners-General were sent to work with Alting to reorganise. On the way there, one of them died and Alting managed to get his son-in-law Johannes Siberg to take his place. The Alting- Siberg duo dominated the Commission and, from the reports of one of the other Commissioners, it seems they worked very hard in their own interests. The Commission cost a lot of money but brought no improvement. In 1795, it became known in Batavia that their homeland (in the meantime having become the Batavian Republic) was once again at war with Great Britain. On 17 February 1797, Willem Arnold Alting resigned as Governor-General and Commissioner- General and handed the post over to Pieter Gerardus van Overstraten. Alting remained as an ordinary citizen, without official position, living on his estate at Kampong Melajoe near Batavia. He died there on 7 June 1800.

Williams was also director of Chinese affairs at the U.S. State Department during the Tiananmen crisis.  Career  Richard L. Williams was born in Chicago, IL in 1929. As a child on the radio program Quiz Kids, he was \\"regarded by many as the best all around kid the Quiz Kids ever turned up,\\"Ruth Duskin Feldman, Whatever Happened to the Quiz Kids, p. 169, Chicago Review Press, 1982 with particular emphasis on math and geography questions. From 1940 to 1945 in 38 cities across the United States, he and three others performed at bond rallies raising $120 million in support of the war effort;Martin Gardner, Quiz Kids, the Radio Program with the Smartest Children in America, 1940‚Äì1953, p.193, McFarland & Company Inc., 2013 the group was featured on prominent radio shows of the day such as Jack Benny and Fred Allen, and was received by luminaries from Eleanor Roosevelt in the White House to Walt Disney in his studio. Williams served in the United States Army, 1953 ‚Äì 1955, detailed to the National Security Agency in its early days. He joined the Foreign Service in 1956. From 1965 to 1967 he was detailed to the White House correspondence staff. From 1968 to 1972 he was a political officer at the Consulate General of the United States, Hong Kong. Between 1972 and 1975 he served as an international relations officer for the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. He was a country officer for Fiji and Papua New Guinea at the Department of State from 1975 to 1977; and then a student at the National War College from 1977 to 1978. In addition he was Deputy Director of the Office of Micronesian Status Negotiations (1978‚Äì1979), Consul General in Guangzhou (Canton) (1979‚Äì1981) (recounted in his 2005 memoir At the Dawn of the New China ), and Deputy Consul General in Hong Kong (1981‚Äì1985). Williams was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to be the first U.S. Ambassador to the Mongolian People's Republic (MPR) on May 8, 1988. Bilateral relations with MPR had only been established a year earlier, in January 1987. Given the infrastructure challenges in Ulaanbaatar at the time, the State Department decided to accredit an Ambassador stationed in Washington. Instead of co- accrediting an ambassador from a usually larger neighboring country, as was standard practice when the State Department did not have the resources to establish a proper embassy in a particular country, the State Department decided to base Williams in Washington in order to avoid giving the Mongolians the impression that it considered them an adjunct of either Moscow or Beijing. During this period Williams also served as Country Director of the Department of State's Office of Chinese and Mongolian Affairs, first through three years of warm Sino-American relations during which he spearheaded successful negotiations on such matters as the launching of US commercial satellites from Chinese sites.Ruan Hong, The Diplomat from China, p. 494, Foreign Languages Press, Beijing, 2007 Then during the particularly tense period following the events of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he provided daily briefings and policy recommendations to Secretary of State James Baker, and through the Secretary to President George H.W. Bush, while meanwhile heading a 300-person task force charged with locating and assisting Americans caught in China when the protests turned violent. For seven years following his 1994 retirement from the Foreign Service, Williams taught graduate level China-related courses at Columbia and New York Universities.  Education  Williams graduated from the University of Chicago (A.B., 1948), Purdue University (B.S., 1951), and Harvard University (M.B.A., 1953).  Personal  Williams married Jane Xuezhen Khuo on March 25, 1961. They reside in Menlo Park, CA. He has a son, Marc Williams, a daughter, Maria Williams Cypher, and three grandchildren.

He was the crew chief for Kurt Busch's 2004 NASCAR Nextel Cup Series' championships.http://www.autoweek.com/article/20130830/NASCAR01/130839972 Fennig has collected 40 Cup wins as crew chief. Biography Fennig raced asphalt and dirt cars in Wisconsin starting in 1970. He raced as a driver until joining the NASCAR Winston Cup Series in 1984 for DiGard Motorsports. Fennig moved to the American Speed Association (ASA) in 1985 for Mark Martin. In their two seasons together in ASA, the duo had 9 wins, 13 pole positions, and the 1986 championship. Fennig returned to the Winston Cup Series as the crew chief for Bobby Allison at Stavola Brothers Racing in 1987. Earlier, Fennig had owned a car that Allison raced in Wisconsin and Michigan on Saturday nights. Allison won two races during their two years together, including the 1988 Daytona 500. The following season, he was paired with fellow Wisconsin racer Dick Trickle, who won the 1989 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year award. Fennig continued to work with then-team owner Bobby Allison until Fennig left the team in October 1996 to join Roush Racing to become Martin's crew chief. Martin/Fennig had 4 wins in 1997, 24 Top 10s, and 3 poles to finish third in the points. Martin finished second in 1998 points with seven victories. They remained together for three more wins, until in they did not win in the 2001 NASCAR season. Jack Roush moved Fennig to the No. 97 crew to be the crew chief for young Kurt Busch in 2002, and Ben Leslie became the crew chief for Mark Martin. The swap was a success as Busch won the NASCAR Nextel Cup Series title in 2004. It was the first year of the Chase for the Cup. Busch dedicated his title to Fennig. Fennig was named the Sporting News crew chief of the year. He continued in that role until 2006. He started out the season as Jamie McMurray's crew chief, and he became the head of Roush Racing Busch Series effort. Fennig became the crew chief for David Ragan after Ragan replaced Martin in the #6 car in 2007, and he remained in that role for 2008. For the 2013 season, Fennig replaced Chad Norris as crew chief for Carl Edwards. The pair won in their second race together, at Phoenix International Raceway. Roush talked about Fennig in 2004: \\"Jimmy Fennig is an unsung hero at Roush Racing. He doesn't do things that create a personal image away from the driver or away from the sponsor or away from the team. He's the trooper that's back there doing everything that he can everyday.\\" Fennig retired after the 2014 season.

It was founded in 2007 by James Watt and Martin Dickie, who together own 46% of the company.  Products  BrewDog produce various types of ales and lagers. For the 12 months to 7 September 2019, Punk IPA was the best selling craft beer in the UK.  History  IPA BrewDog was founded in Fraserburgh in 2007 by James Watt and Martin Dickie. In 2009, BrewDog purchased their first bar, in nearby Aberdeen. At the end of 2018, the company, and its franchisees, operated 78 bars worldwide. In 2011, BrewDog was described as \\"one of the prime movers\\" behind the campaign which changed the law in 2011 to allow new beer measures in Britain. 2011 also saw the company offered crowdfunding shares totalling ¬£2 million, the equivalent of 8% of the capital of the company. The shares were sold at ¬£23.75 and accompanied several benefits such as discounts in their bars and online purchase of their beers, and the opportunity to attend their annual shareholders meeting. The main brewing moved from Fraserburgh to nearby Ellon in 2012. In 2014, the company ended operations in Fraserburgh. In March 2015, BrewDog was awarded ¬£1.5m in Regional Selective Assistance. That same month, the company announced plans to increase its workforce by 130 employees. In February 2016, BrewDog open- sourced its beer recipes to the public, making them a form of Free Beer. Private equity firm, TSG Consumer Partners acquired a 22% stake in the company for approximately ¬£213 million in April 2017. In February 2018, BrewDog announced that it plans to build a $30 million production brewery and tap room on an greenfield site in the Metroplex complex at Murarrie, in Brisbane, Australia. In November 2019, the company announced that it would be expanding its footprint in the United States with a new distillery. In December 2019 BrewDog opened its first bar in Ireland, at the Capital Dock development in the upmarket Grand Canal Dock area of Dublin. Camden In January 2020, BrewDog opened its first alcohol-free bar in London. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it shifted its distillery production towards making free hand sanitizer for local hospitals and charities.  Controversies  BrewDog's provocative marketing has been a key aspect of its business, and has gained them substantial international coverage. In 2008, BrewDog was challenged by UK drinks industry watchdog, the Portman Group. BrewDog denied these allegations and countered that Portman was impeding the development of smaller brewing companies. In December 2008, after an 8-month long dispute and a preliminary adjudication, which had ruled against the company, BrewDog were cleared of all breaches of the Code of Practice and were permitted to continue marketing their brands without making any changes to the packaging. In protest to their targeting, BrewDog introduced \\"Speedball\\", saying \\"...we thought we would give them something worth banning us for...\\". Speedball was promptly banned by Portman before being renamed as \\"Dogma\\". BrewDog has produced progressively stronger beers and has laid claim to the title 'strongest beer ever brewed' on more than one occasion. Squirrel container of BrewDog's The End of History beer (55% ABV) In 2009, its \\"Tokyo*\\" brew caused controversy when UK watchdog the Portman Group criticised the availability of a beer of that strength in 330 ml bottles with traditional crown caps. Also in 2009, BrewDog launched a beer called \\"Tactical Nuclear Penguin\\", with 32% alcohol, which was claimed to be the strongest beer ever made. In 2010, BrewDog announced \\"Sink The Bismarck\\", an apparent 41% ABV to reclaim the World's Strongest Beer title from Schorschbr√§u, who had produced a 40% ABV version of their Schorschbock. Also in 2010, BrewDog produced a 55% ABV freeze-distilled beer called \\"The End of History\\", with the bottles packaged in small stuffed animals, priced at ¬£500 and ¬£700 each. Only 12 bottles were produced; 11 for retail sale, with the other one going to Internet video blog BeerTapTV. BrewDog claimed that this set new records not only for alcoholic strength in a beer, but also for price. Advocates for Animals called the gimmick 'perverse'. The title \\"strongest beer of the world\\" then fell back to Mr Tscheuschner from the Schorschbr√§u brewery in Germany, whose Schorschbock 57 boasts an ABV of 57.5%. The title for world's strongest beer has since changed again though, allegedly to Brewmeister's \\"Snake Venom\\" at a reputed 67.5%, although independent testing has yet to be published to confirm the ABV. In 2014 Portman claimed BrewDog to be in breach of their Code of Practice ‚Äúfor encouraging both anti- social behaviour and rapid drinking‚Äù through the labelling of the Dead Pony Club IPA, which they claimed placed ‚Äúundue emphasis on the strength and intoxicating effect of the alcohol in the product.‚Äù In March 2017, BrewDog threatened legal action against an independent pub based in Birmingham, England called \\"Lone Wolf\\", a trademark owned by BrewDog. A day later, after the story was reported in The Guardian, BrewDog director James Watt confirmed via Twitter that the company had no issue allowing the bar to use the name \\"Lone Wolf\\", despite it having already rebranded as \\"The Wolf\\". However, Brewdog released a statement at a later date saying \\"Hands up, we made a mistake in how we acted\\", blaming 'trigger happy lawyers' as the source of blame. The next day, further controversy arose over an alleged previous threat of legal action from BrewDog against a bar calling itself \\"Draft Punk\\". BrewDog's Watt later released a blog statement citing the allegation as inaccurate, calling it an example of \\"opportunistic lies combined with inaccurate journalism\\", noting that BrewDog does also own the 'Punk' trademark for beer. In May 2019, BrewDog was accused of stealing marketing concepts from a public relations firm named Manifest London, and from job applicants using fake interviews and other deceptive practices.  TV series James Watt and Martin Dickie also had a show in 2013 on American television network Esquire Network that lasted three seasons. After the channel ceased operations, BrewDog decided to launch BrewDog Network, which features a selection of original content.  Awards  BrewDog won the 2008 Prince's Scottish Youth Business Trust Young Entrepreneur of the Year award. Paradox Grain won a Gold Medal at the 2008 World Beer Cup in the Wood and Barrel-aged Strong Beer Category. BrewDog won the Tenon Entrepreneur of the Year Award for demonstrating exceptional vision and leadership at the 2008 National Business Awards for Scotland. The Physics won World's Best Strong Pale Ale (Sub Category Winner) and Rip Tide won World's Best Imperial Stout (Style Trophy Winner) at the 2007 World Beer Awards, an annual competition organised by Beers of the World magazine. Hardcore IPA won Gold at the 2010 World Beer Cup in the Imperial IPA category. In 2012, BrewDog revealed that Diageo had threatened to withdraw funding from BII Scotland's annual awards if BrewDog was named winner of the Best Bar Operator award. Diageo later apologised to BrewDog for what they called a \\"serious misjudgement by Diageo staff\\". In 2018, it achieved a 2-star accreditation from Best Companies. In 2019, it achieved the lower 1-star accreditation, with a BCI score of 666.2.

The tournament will be divided in two stages. In the first one, called Ta√ßa Fernando Carvalho (Fernando Carvalho Cup, in reference to former Internacional chairman, winner of the 2006 Copa Libertadores and FIFA Club World Cup), teams from one group will play in single round-robin format against clubs of the other group. Top four teams in each group advance to quarterfinals. In home-and-away system, winners qualify to semifinals and then, to the finals. Later, in Ta√ßa F√°bio Koff (F√°bio Koff Cup, in reference to former Gr√™mio chairman, winner of the 1983 Intercontinental Cup, 1983 and 1995 Copa Libertadores), teams in the same group will play each other once. Again, top four teams will play quarterfinals, winners play semifinals and then finals. If the same club wins both stages, they will be declared champions. Otherwise, a final will be disputed in home-and-away system.  Background  On January 15, just one week before its debut in the championship, a bus carrying all Brasil squad crashed in the 150th kilometer of the BR-392 road, in the city of Cangu√ßu, southern Rio Grande do Sul. The team was heading back to Pelotas after beating Santa Cruz 2‚Äì1 in a friendly match played in Vale do Sol, near Santa Cruz do Sul. The bus plunged off a 130-foot ravine after the driver lost its control when approaching a turn. The accident caused the death of three members of the team: goalkeeper trainer Giovani Guimar√£es, defender R√©gis Gouveia and striker Claudio Milar. Milar is considered to be one of the most notable players in the history of the club, scoring 110 goals in approximately 200 caps. Several other players sustained injuries. Among the injured was Copa Libertadores 1995 winner and 1996 Olympic bronze-medalist Danrlei. After the disaster, several clubs offered to loan players for free in order to help Brasil to play in the tournament. Also, companies as Multisom and Banrisul signed special sponsorship deals to provide financial support. On January 19, club managers and the Rio Grande do Sul Football Federation decided that Brasil should skip their first 5 matches, debuting on February 3 against Santa Cruz.

From an essentially fully public system based on the Social Security Act 1938, reforms have introduced market and health insurance elements primarily since the 1980s, creating a mixed public- private system for delivering healthcare. *The Accident Compensation Corporation covers the costs of treatment for cases deemed 'accidents', including medical misadventure, for all people legally in New Zealand (including tourists). The costs are recovered via levies on employers, employees, petrol and vehicle registration, and contributions from the general tax pool. *The relatively extensive and high-quality system of public hospitals treats citizens or permanent residents free of charge and is managed by district health boards. However, costly or difficult operations often require long waiting list delays unless the treatment is medically urgent. Because of this, a secondary market of health insurance organisations exists which fund operations and treatments for their members privately. Southern Cross Health Insurance, a non-profit organisation, is the largest of these at about 60% of the health insurance market and covering almost a quarter of all New Zealanders in 2007, even operating its own chain of hospitals. *Primary care (non-specialist doctors / family doctors) and medications on the list of the New Zealand government agency PHARMAC require co-payments, but are subsidised, especially for patients with community health services cards or high user health cards. *Emergency services are primarily provided by St John New Zealand charity (as well as Wellington Free Ambulance in the Wellington Region), supported with a mix of private (donated) and public (subsidy) funds. *New Zealand has one of the highest nurse turnover rates. Not all nurses leave the profession but rather continuously switch organisations. Not all the impact of nurses leaving is negative, but when it is it can cause reduced continuity of care, disruption of services, and a drop and overall productivity. In 2012, New Zealand spent 8.7% of GDP on health care, or US$3,929 per capita. Of that, approximately 77% was government expenditure. In a 2010 study, New Zealand was shown to have the lowest level of medication use in 14 developed countries (i.e. used least medicines overall), and also spent the lowest amount on healthcare amongst the same list of countries, with US$2510 ($3460) per capita, compared to the United States at US$7290.  History of health care  Until well after European contact MƒÅori used natural medicines and spiritual healing. Among the European colonists, professional medical care was expensive and most people diagnosed themselves or sought alternative treatment. In the mid 19th century New Zealand's first public hospitals created by Governor George Grey and were available for those who could not afford a private doctor. The Public Health Act 1872 introduced local authority health boards. These were funded primarily by the local ratepayers and subsidised by the national government. There was still a large reliance on private charity to make up any shortfall. From 1909 poorer districts were given disproportionately more funding from the national government. In 1938, the Social Security Act from the First Labour Government attempted to provide government funded healthcare to all. A free health system, with hospital and other health services universally available to all New Zealanders was the vision behind the Social Security Act 1938. This was never fully realised due to ongoing disputes between the medical profession and the Government. Health services evolved as a dual system of public and private health care subsidised through a series of arrangements known as the General Medical Service (GMS) benefits established in 1941. This remained largely unchanged until the late 1970s. From 1984 to 1993 the Labour then National governments introduced major changes designed to get area health boards (later Crown health enterprises) to imitate market forces. User charges were introduced for prescriptions in February 1985 but broader controversial policies introduced by the Fourth National Government between 1991 and 1993 effectively ended largely free provision of primary healthcare, such services being targeted on the basis of income while Community Service Cards (introduced on 1 February 1992) provided additional support.Community Service Cards Authored by Steve Maharey, former Minister of Social Development New Zealand Parliamentary Debates, 19 September 1985, pg 6,971Healthcare Public hospital charges of $50 for overnight stays were briefly implemented but was later abandoned as the 1993 election approached. New Zealand has had numerous public health campaigns and initiatives. Children were given free milk between 1937 and 1967 but these were abolished due to budgetary constraints, fluoride is added most drinking water in the country and there have been many anti-drinking (from the 1870s) and anti-smoking campaigns (from the 1960s). Structure The Ministry of Health is responsible for the oversight and funding of the twenty district health boards (DHBs). These are responsible for organising healthcare in the district and meeting the standards set by the Ministry of Health. Twenty-one DHBs came into being on 1 January 2001 with Southland and Otago DHBs merging into Southern DHB on 1 May 2010. The boards for each district health board are elected in elections held every three years, with the exception of one of the eight board members, who is appointed by the Ministry of Health. The DHBs oversee the forty-six primary health organisations established throughout the country. These were first set up in July 2002, with a mandate to focus on the health of communities. Originally there were 81 of these, but this has been reduced down to 46 in 2008. They are funded by DHBs, and are required to be entirely non-profit, democratic bodies that are responsive to their communities' needs. Almost all New Zealanders are enrolled in a PHO, as there are financial incentives for the patients to become enrolled. The Northern Region DHBs also use shared services provided by the Northern DHB Support Agency and HealthAlliance. These services deliver region-wide health initiatives and shared IT services and logistics. The Canterbury District Health Board has been successful in redesigning services to reduce hospital use. Some of this transformation was precipitated by the 2011 Christchurch earthquake when several healthcare buildings were damaged or destroyed. It now has lower rates of acute medical admissions, low average lengths of stay, fewer readmissions in acute care, fewer cancelled planned admissions and more conditions treated out of hospital. Public vs. private payment Hospital and specialist care in New Zealand is totally covered by the government if the patient is referred by a general or family practitioner and this is funded from government expenditure (approx. 77%). Private payment by individuals also plays an important role in the overall system although the cost of these payments are comparatively minor. Those earning less than certain amounts, depending on the number of dependents in their household, can qualify for a Community Services Card (CSC). This reduces the cost of after-hours doctors' visits, and prescription fees, as well as the cost of visits to a person's regular doctor. Injuries which occur as a result of \\"accidents\\", ranging from minor to major physical but including psychological trauma from sexual abuse are generally covered by the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). This may include coverage for doctors visits and lump-sum payments.  Waiting lists  In New Zealand's public health system it is typical for medical appointments, particularly surgeries to have a waiting list. District Health Boards are typical judged in the media and by government in part based on the length of these lists. In 2016, it was inferred that many people required surgery but were not put on the official list. Research projected that of all the people who had been told they needed surgery less than half were on the official list. However, the main concern noted by heath industry observers was the overall increase in waiting time, about 304 days. Telehealth In 2018 the Northern Region district health boards, Northland, Waitemata, Auckland and Counties Manukau developed a telehealth system with a unified video, audio, content sharing and chat platform provided by Zoom Video Communications which is intended to lead to a more integrated health system in the Northern Region. This should enable real-time consultations between clinicians in hospital, primary care and the community, and between patients and their care providers.  Healthcare organisations  The list of well-known Healthcare organisations in New Zealand are:http://www.hcha.org.nz/find-a- provider/region/auckland ‚Äì Geneva Healthcare ‚Äì Counties Manukau Homecare Trust ‚Äì Healthcare of New Zealand Holdings Ltd ‚Äì Healthvision ‚Äì Life Plus Ltd ‚Äì Healthcare NZ ‚Äì Royal District Nursing Service New Zealand Abortion Abortion is legal upon request in New Zealand. According to figures released by Statistics New Zealand, the number of abortions rose from 8.5 per 1,000 women aged 15‚Äí44 years in 1980 to 14 per 1,000 women in 1990. By 2000, this figure had risen to 18.7 per 1,000 women aged 15‚Äí44 years but has since declined to 13.5 per 1,000 women as of 2018. Medications The Pharmaceutical Management Agency of New Zealand (PHARMAC) was set up in 1993 to decide which medications the government will subsidise. In general, PHARMAC will select an effective and safe medication from a class of drugs, and negotiate with the drug manufacturer to obtain the best price. There are approximately 2,000 drugs listed on the national schedule that are either fully or partially subsidised. In a sample of 13 developed countries New Zealand was thirteenth in its population weighted usage of medication in 14 classes in 2009 and also in 2013. The drugs studied were selected on the basis that the conditions treated had high incidence, prevalence and/or mortality, caused significant long-term morbidity and incurred high levels of expenditure and significant developments in prevention or treatment had been made in the last 10 years. The study noted considerable difficulties in cross border comparison of medication use. Sildenafil was reclassified in New Zealand in 2014 so it could be bought over the counter from a pharmacist. It is thought that this reduced sales over the Internet and was safer as men could be referred for medical advice if appropriate. Emergency service Most emergency and non-urgent ambulance transportation is carried out by the charitable organisation St John New Zealand. In Wairarapa and the Wellington Region ambulance services are provided by the Wellington Free Ambulance organisation.

Importance Changing yarn weight or needle size can have a significant impact on the finished project, so standardized systems have been spread about, as well as conversion systems for regional standards (especially needle sizes). Yarn weight is important in achieving the correct gauge or tension for a particular project and can help with yarn substitution. The Craft Yarn Council of America has developed a system that seeks to standardize the labeled weights of yarn.The CYC weight system can be found at http://www.craftyarncouncil.com/weight.html Most yarns state their weight on the ball band but some may not, only giving the composition. Some brands use a standardized numbering system that uses seven ranges of relative thickness of yarn. However there are methods for individuals to gauge weight for themselves. Wrap method One way of determining the weight of an unknown yarn is to use the wrapping method. This convenient method is also used to calculate the amount of yarn needed for a project. By this method it is possible to check yarn for sale with a simple pencil and ruler without unwinding the skein, simply slipping the pencil under approximately an inch of the threads and holding a ruler against them. Wrap the yarn around a large needle or a ruler. Make sure the yarn lies flat. Push the yarn together so there are no gaps between wraps. Smooth it out so it is neither too loose nor too tight. Measure the number of wraps per inch (2.5 cm). For better accuracy, measure the wraps at the center of your yarn sample. The number of wraps will act as a gauge to assess the thickness of unmarked yarn; for example 12 wraps per inch is 12 WPI, and is used to calculate how much yarn is required for various articles,Wraps per inch with tables so that 12 WPI is equivalent to 8 ply (worsted weight, medium weight) yarn. Swatch methods A more hands-on method, there is the Test swatch and the Gauge swatch. Knitting a Test swatch requires at its simplest, knitting the yarn into a small, roughly 4 in (10 cm) square textile of even stitches.The Principles of Knitting By June Hiatt, Simon & Schuster. p.457 Comparing this with recommended needle sizes, yarn, and the knitter's own signature tension, allows for adjustments to all of these things. For example, changing needle size is one way to bring the test swatch nearer to an accurate measurement in yarn weight. The Gauge swatch goes further. Not only is it a tool for checking whether yarn conforms to a desired dimension, but it is usually produced with some of the complexities of the intended project (i.e. multiple colours, varied stitches, edgings) making it a much larger test piece. This larger sample is then \\"dressed\\" meaning washed, ironed, and subjected to other processes expected of the finished item. It is especially used for items that require a lot of work and time, to avoid dimensional mistakes in the long run.

Kelly recalled of the events: \\"On the Friday I signed for Blackpool, within 24 hours I had travelled from London to Bramall Lane and was playing against Sheffield United. We got beaten 2‚Äì1 ‚Äì and we desperately needed the points too ‚Äì but meeting my new colleagues in the dressing room and having my first experience of Blackpool's polished style of play helped to make it an otherwise unforgettable day.\\" He scored his first goal for the club later that season, on 26 February 1955 in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to West Lancashire rivals Preston North End. The following summer he toured with a Football Association XI, playing against Bermuda on 12 May 1955. In October 1955 he had a transfer request turned down, and another request in January 1956 was also turned down. In 1958 he won another representative honour when he played for the FA XI against the Army. In the 1959‚Äì60 season he became Blackpool's club captain. He then gained his coaching certificate at Lilleshall. In May 1961, after 244 league and cup games for Blackpool, Kelly emigrated to Australia, where he joined South Coast United in New South Wales. He was voted Player of the Year by three newspapers in Sydney at the end of 1961: the Sydney Morning Herald, the Illawarra Mercury and the Sydney Daily Telegraph. He then became player-coach of South Coast United and went on to coach the Australian national team, as well as the New South Wales Federation. In the 1964‚Äì65 season he won the Sydney First Grade League competition with South Coast United. He was offered a new contract but chose instead to go back to England in 1965. He returned to the Fylde coast playing non-League football in the Lancashire Combination with Fleetwood in the 1966‚Äì67 season. In the summer of 1968 he returned to Australia for a second spell. After football In 1965 Kelly established an insurance broker company, Jim Kelly & Co. Ltd, in Blackpool. The company still bears his name. Kelly died on 10 August 2003, aged 71.

The site was home of the main branch of the Vancouver Public Library from 1957 to 1995.History of the Vancouver Public Library (750 Burrard Street section) In December 1996, Canada's first (and ultimately only) Virgin Megastore opened on the lower level; Virgin eventually decided to exit the Canadian market and sold the location to HMV in September 2005. In late 2011, HMV Canada, now separately owned by Hilco UK, announced plans to close the Burrard location in January 2012 as part of a corporate refocusing towards smaller locations. HMV closed at this location on January 23, 2012. The southeast corner of the building was also the first Planet Hollywood in Vancouver opened on March 16, 1997. The main entrance was on 969 Robson Street. It was closed in October 1999 after bankruptcy. The upper levels were taken over in fall 1997 as studios for the newly launched independent TV station VTV. The station later became part of the CTV Television Network (now owned by Bell Media), and the site now serves as Bell Media's west coast headquarters. The site selection, and much of the VTV format, had been inspired by Toronto station City and the iconic downtown studios that were at the time synonymous with the station. Incidentally, CTV would later acquire the Toronto building in question (but not City TV). The Globe and Mail, which was co-owned with CTV from 2001 to 2010, later moved its Vancouver offices into part of CTV's space; its offices remain in the building despite no longer sharing common ownership with CTV. Later, radio stations 94.5 Virgin Radio, 103.5 QMFM, TSN Radio 1040 and TSN Radio 1410 (now BNN Bloomberg Radio 1410), all co-owned with CTV since 2007, also moved into the building. In the early 2010s, CTV reduced its space so that its offices are no longer directly accessible from Burrard Street; though it remains in the same building, it now uses the address 969 Robson Street. Besides Bell Media and the Globe, current occupants include a flagship Victoria's Secret / Pink store, as well as a Clearly Contacts retail store.

There is also a chat box in the sidebar to allow meta communication. First launched in November 2008, the software was acquired by Google in December 2009 and released as open source later that month. Further development is coordinated by the Etherpad Foundation.  Features and implementation  Anyone can create a new collaborative document, known as a \\"pad\\". Each pad has its own URL, and anyone who knows this URL can edit the pad and participate in the associated chats. Password-protected pads are also possible. Each participant is identified by a color and a name. The software auto-saves the document at regular, short intervals, but participants can permanently save specific versions (checkpoints) at any time. Merging of changes is handled by operational transform. A \\"time slider\\" feature allows anyone to explore the history of the pad. The document can be downloaded in plain text, HTML, Open Document, Microsoft Word, or PDF format. Automated markup of JavaScript code was made available shortly after the launch. Etherpad itself is implemented in JavaScript, on top of the AppJet platform, with the real-time functionality achieved through Comet streaming. At the time of its launch, Etherpad was the first web application of its kind to achieve true real-time performance, a feat previously only achieved by desktop applications such as SubEthaEdit (for Mac), Gobby, or MoonEdit (both cross-platform). Existing collaborative web editors at the time could only achieve near-real-time performance. The client- side text editor in Etherpad and its Etherpad Lite fork is implemented using Appjet's in-browser text editor, written in JavaScript.  Launch  Etherpad was launched on November 19, 2008 by David Greenspan, Aaron Iba, and J.D. Zamfirescu (the latter two being former Google employees). They were later joined by former Googler Daniel Clemens and designer David Cole. The original website was \`etherpad.com\`. Etherpad was covered by Slashdot on November 21, 2008, resulting in server slowdown and downtime. This led the developers to temporarily revert the tool to closed beta, not allowing new pads to be created (but providing full and unrestricted access to the existing ones), while the server infrastructure was being improved. After the rewrite of the software was completed, the new version went live on 29 January 2009, and on February 3, the site became again open to all.  Acquisition  When Google Wave was announced, the Etherpad team wrote on their blog comparing the two platforms and stating that the minimalist and targeted Etherpad interface could be an advantage in some use cases. Still, on 4 December 2009, Etherpad announced on its blog that it had been acquired by Google for integration into Google Wave. Existing Etherpad users would receive invites for Google Wave. On 31 March 2010, Etherpad announced that creation of new pads would be allowed until April 14 (pad creation was still allowed as of April 18, though) and existing pads could still be accessed and used until May 14. Options for download/export were available. The Etherpad service terminated on May 14.  Open-source  Google released the source code for Etherpad under the Apache License version 2.0 on December 17, 2009. Subsequently, Google asked the Etherpad code maintainers to remove JSMin from its code tree due to a clause in its license stating, \\"The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil,\\" which is not compatible with the open source licenses allowed on Google Code. After the release of the software as open source, a number of people have set up Etherpad servers, as clones of the original website. Soon after, users and programmers of Etherpad, after an initial meeting in the #etherpad channel on freenode, created the Etherpad Foundation to coordinate further development. Their website maintains a list of a growing number of sites that run the Etherpad software.  Etherpad Lite  Etherpad Lite is an almost complete rewrite of the original Etherpad software, based on different technical foundations and written by different authors. While the original Etherpad is written in Java and Scala and has quite demanding system requirements, Etherpad Lite is written in server-side JavaScript using node.js. The original realtime synchronization library (called Easysync) remains the same. Etherpad Lite has some distinctive features which are not available in the original version: * An HTTP API which allows the user to interact with the pad contents, and with user and group management * A jQuery plugin exists which helps embedding the collaborative editor in other sites * Clients for PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Java, Objective-C and Perl which interface with the API. * More than 50 plugins, among them email_notifications, invite_via_email, offline_edit, fileupload, tables or rtc for video calls based on WebRTC. Etherpad Lite offers a number of export formats, including LaTeX, but not Markdown. Etherpad Lite supports many natural languages. Localization is achieved collaboratively through translatewiki.net.

He was lieutenant-general of the King's Armies. In 1726, de Valli√®re became Director-General of the Battalions and Schools of the Artillery. Valli√®re was a member of the Acad√©mie de Marine. After his death, his seat went to Chabert-Cogolin. Through the Royal Ordonnance of 7 October 1732, Valli√®re endeavoured to reorganize and standardize the King's artillery. He significantly improved the method used for founding cannons, superseding the technique developed by Jean-Jacques Keller. He thus developed the de Valli√®re system,A Dictionary of Military History and the Art of War By Andr√© Corvisier, p.837 which set the standard for French artillery until the advent of the Gribeauval system. De Valli√®re system Whereas numerous formats and designs had been in place in the French army, de Valli√®re standardized the French sizes in artillery pieces, by allowing only for the production of 24 (Canon de 24), 12, 8 and 4 pound guns (the weight is the weight of the cannonballs), mortars of 12 and 8 French inches, and stone-throwing mortars of 15 French inches. The French pound weighing 1.097 English pounds, the French guns fired slightly heavier balls (13.164 pounds) than their English equivalent 12-pounder.History.navy.mil The French inch was 2.707 cm, slightly longer than the English inch of 2.54 cm.Chartrand, p.2 The de Valli√®re system used core drilling of the bore of cannons founded in one piece of bronze, a method developed at that time by Jean Maritz, which allowed for much higher precision of the bore shape and surface, and therefore higher shooting efficiency. The de Valliere guns were also highly decorative and contained numerous designs and inscriptions. Barrel The back part occasionally included an inscription showing the weight of the cannonball (for example a \\"4\\" for a 4-pounder), followed by a Latin inscription \\"Nec pluribus impar,\\" meaning that the King is \\"No unequal match for many,\\" i.e. \\"None his equal.\\" This was followed by the royal crest of the Bourbon dynasty. The location and date of manufacture were inscribed (in the example \\"Strasbourg, 1745\\") at the bottom of the gun, and finally the name and title of the founder (in the example \\"Fondu par Jean Maritz, Commissaire des Fontes\\").Springfield Armory The breech was decorated with an animal face showing the rating of the gun (in the example the lion head for a 24-pounder). Breech design The guns had cascabel designs which allowed to easily recognize their rating: a 4-pounder would have a \\"Face in a sunburst\\", an 8-pounder a \\"Monkey head\\", a 12-pounder a \\"Rooster head\\", a 16-pounder a \\"Medusa head\\", and a 24-pounder a \\"Bacchus head\\" or a \\"Lion head\\". Operational activity The de Valliere guns proved rather good in siege warfare, but were less satisfactory in a war of movement. This was especially visible during the War of the Austrian Succession (1747‚Äì1748), and during the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763) where mobility was a key factor and lighter guns were clearly in need. The lack of howitzers was another issue.Napoleon's Guns, 1792-1815 by Ren√© Chartrand, Ray Hutchins, p.2 Numerous de Valliere guns were used in the American War of Independence, especially the smaller field guns. The guns were shipped from France, and the field carriages provided for in the US. These guns played an important role in such battles as the Battle of Saratoga, and the Siege of Yorktown. George Washington wrote about the guns in a letter to General Heath on 2 May 1777: Obsolescence Jean-Florent de Valli√®re had a son, Joseph Florent de Valli√®re (1717‚Äì1776), who became Commander of the Battalions and Schools of the Artillery in 1747, who persisted in implementing his father's system. From 1763, Gribeauval, as Inspector General of the French Artillery, and second in rank to de Valli√®re, started efforts to introduce the more modern system that would give France one of the strongest artilleries for the following century.Napoleon's Guns, 1792-1815 by Ren√© Chartrand, Ray Hutchins, p.6 Notes References * Chartrand, Ren√© 2003 Napoleon's guns 1792-1815 (2) Osprey Publishing * Valliere system Category:1667 births Category:1759 deaths Category:French generals Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences ","title":"Florent-Jean de Valli√®re"},{"id":"20298018","text":"Jean-Fran√ßois Mayet (born 30 January 1940 in Vatan, Indre) is a member of the Senate of France, representing the Indre department.

Renovation The stadium was supposed to properly renovated by the early 2010. This caused a temporary relocation of FK Olimpik to the Grbavica Stadium. The renovation included covering of the present west stand, and building three totally new covered stands. The seating capacity was supposed to be raised to 9,000 and the ground surface was supposed to be covered in artificial grass.

Career Early life Davis was born at Sarson Street, now part of Amport, near Andover, Hampshire. According to Hortus Veitchii, he \\"inherited from his father a taste for Natural History and outdoor pursuits, which later took the form of a love of gardening\\". At 12 years old, he left school and started work in the gardens of the Marquess of Winchester at Amport House; the house had been rebuilt in 1857, and the gardens were being re- modelled. He then moved to Wilton Park Gardens, at Beaconsfield where he stayed for four years, rising to the rank of departmental foreman. His travels then took him to work for Mr. C. Ryder at Slade, Kent followed by a spell at the gardens of Mr. T. W. Evans at Allestree Hall, Derby, before, in 1870, he joined James Veitch & Sons at Chelsea, London. James Veitch & Sons At Chelsea, he worked under John Dominy in the \\"New Plant Department\\" and eventually became foreman in charge of the Nepenthes and fine foliage plants. In 1873, following the departures of George Downton and A. R. Endres, Harry Veitch was looking for a plant collector to travel to South America to locate and collect a quantity of the orchid, Masdevallia veitchiana, which had been introduced to England in 1867, following its discovery by Richard Pearce but was still scarce. Veitch selected Davis, and on 2 August 1873 he departed for South America. He remained in South America for three years, during which time he crossed the Andean Cordilleras in Peru, Colombia and Bolivia at least twenty times, at elevations of up to and, like his predecessor Gustav Wallis he traversed the continent, travelling the entire length of the Amazon River. During his trip, he was successful not only in collecting M. veitchiana but several other species of the genus, including the graceful violet-blue M. ionocharis (which he found in the Andean valley of Sandia, in the province of Carabaya, Peru, at elevation) and the golden-yellow M. davisii (the Incas' Qoriwaqanki or \\"golden waqanki\\"), which Davis discovered in the vicinity of Cusco, Peru. He sent flowers to Heinrich Reichenbach for identification; in The Gardeners' Chronicle, Reichenbach described this new species as \\"M. davisii\\", saying: > \\"This is a beautiful thing, much like M. harryana and veitchiana.... The > other parts of the flower are yellowish, white and of the deepest splendid > orange inside; so that it would appear to give a most welcome contrast in a > group of the scarlet and vermillion and white Masdevallias. It was > discovered by a, most probably new collector, Mr. W. Davis... I have a very > good opinion of this collector, who was introduced to me by a set of new > dried Orchids; so I thought it my duty to attach the name of such a > promising collector to such a welcome Masdevallia.\\" Near Arequipa in Peru, he also discovered a new species of tuberous begonia, Begonia davisii, which was also named after him. B. davisii was later used in the early days of breeding Begonia √ó tuberhybrida cultivars by John Seden in the Veitch Nurseries at Coombe Wood. Return to England On his return to England in 1877, Davis was selected to conduct a botanical analysis of herbage on the experimental plots at Rothamsted. He returned to Chelsea on the termination of this engagement and re-commenced employment for Veitch Nurseries, working in the plant propagation department. He became a specialist in this field, and wrote for the Exchange & Mart for many years under the pseudonyms of Charles Benett (using his mother's maiden name) and Curiosus. Later life Davis continued to work for James Veitch & Sons until the dissolution of the business in 1914, after which he became secretary to the Geological Society and then the Royal Geographical Society. He also acted as secretary to a philanthropic society managed by American women in London. Following a paralytic stroke which led to failing eyesight, Davis spent the last ten years of his life in retirement, in the care of his eldest daughter, in Fulham. He died on 18 November 1930, and his obituary in the Journal of Botany praised his contribution to botany: \\"with his passing the world of orchidology bids farewell to one of the last reminders of an elegant and exciting period in orchid discovery and cultivation\\".

It was discovered by Captain W.D. Burnham of the American ship Pactolus on November 6, 1885. The bank has been proposed as a possible location for Elizabeth Island, a phantom island reported by Sir Francis Drake in October 1578. However, subsequent surveys have been unable to locate the bank, which may itself be a phantom. Discovery Burnham reported to the US Hydrographic Office that 'while running before a gale off Cape Horn in command of the American ship Pactolus at 4 o'clock in the morning of 6 November 1885, the wind lulled and the sea fell, and noticing very highly discoloured water, he hove the ship to and sounded three times, obtaining each time from 67 to 70 fms. Black sand and small rocks'. He then 'ran South for 30 miles before the water, which all the time was very thick and yellow, resumed its natural colour'. He reports 'the line of demarcation was very distinct'. USHO 1938; quoted in Riesenberg p65-66 Burnham gives the position of the soundings as . He states that an English ship from San Francisco to Liverpool reported discoloured water in the same location at the same time. Riesenberg p65-66 Marine historian Felix Riesenberg notes that earlier mariners had observed large icebergs stationary in the area, suggesting they had grounded on the bank; these have typically been 200 ft or more in height, with a corresponding depth of 800 to 1,400 ft below the surface;Riesenberg p207 others could have been several miles in length and up to 1000 ft high, while a berg sighted by a Captain CC Dixon in 1860 was L-shaped, 50 miles long on one leg, and 30 miles on the other.Riesenberg p208 These bergs have been observed stationary for up to a month in the vicinity of the bank, and are thought to be responsible for the loss of several ships that have run into them, or been trapped.Riesenberg p207-8 Significance Felix Riesenberg, who served under Burnham, postulated that Pactolus Bank was the sunken location of Elizabeth Island, discovered by Sir Francis Drake's ship the Golden Hinde in 1578. Leaving the Magellan Strait, Drake's ship was driven far to the west and south, before clawing its way back towards land. On 22 October the ship anchored off an island which Drake, according to Riesenberg, named \\"Elizabeth Island,\\" where wood and water was collected and seals and penguins captured for food, along with \\"herbs of great virtue.\\" According to Drake's Portuguese pilot, Nu√±o Da Silva, their position at the anchorage was 57¬∞S. However, no island has been confirmed at that latitude, although a sinking volcanic island may have been sighted in that vicinity by the Danish ship Lutterfeld in December 1876 or 1877. Historian Mateo Martinic consider however Sars Bank, 350 km south of Diego Ram√≠rez Islands, as the best fit for Elizabeth Island. Fate The USS Bear (AG-29) investigated the area in March 1940, but her log does not mention any soundings or results. The investigated the area in 1956 and found no indication of a shoal. The importance of these attempts is extremely limited, mainly due to the severe weather these ships had to operate in. So Pactolus Bank may itself be a phantom island. In 2008, Dutchman Hylke Tromp, after some years of research, published a comprehensive report, containing all known facts and myths regarding the Pactolus Bank.

Elected Senator from the Rh√¥ne on 24 September 1995, he was the right's official candidate in the municipal elections in 2001 in Lyon, incumbent Mayor Raymond Barre having refused to run for re-election. Arriving behind the right-wing dissident list supported by Charles Millon in his sector, the 5th arrondissement of Lyon, he decided to withdraw in favor of Jean-Michel Dubernard, who established an alliance with Charles Millon.

There are more forms of the Czech language used in Moravia than in the rest of the Czech Republic. The main four groups of dialects are the Bohemian-Moravian group, the Central Moravian group, the Eastern Moravian group and the Lach (Silesian) group (which is also spoken in Czech Silesia). While the forms are generally viewed as regional variants of Czech, some Moravians (108,469 in the 2011 Census) claim them to be one separate Moravian language. Southeastern Moravian dialects form a dialect continuum with the closely related Slovak language, and are thus sometimes viewed as dialects of Slovak rather than Czech. Until the 19th century, the language used in Slavic-speaking areas of Moravia was referred to as ‚ÄúMoravian‚Äù or as ‚ÄúCzech‚Äù. When regular censuses started in Austria-Hungary in 1880, the choice of main-communication languages in the forms prescribed in Cisleithania did not include Czech language but included the single item Bohemian‚ÄìMoravian‚ÄìSlovak (the others being German, Polish, Rusyn, Slovene, Serbo-Croatian, Italian, Romanian and Hungarian). Respondents who chose Bohemian‚ÄìMoravian‚ÄìSlovak as their main communicating language were counted in the Austrian censuses as Czechs. On the occasion of 2011 Census of the Czech Republic, several Moravian organizations (political party Moravan√© and Moravian National Community amongst others) led a campaign to promote the Moravian ethnicity and language. The Czech Statistical Office assured the Moravan√© party that filling in ‚ÄúMoravian‚Äù as language would not be treated as ticking off ‚ÄúCzech‚Äù, because forms were processed by a computer and superseding Czech for Moravian was technically virtually impossible. According to the results of the census, there was a total number of 108,469 native speakers of Moravian in 2011. Of them, 62,908 consider Moravian to be their only native language, and 45,561 are native speakers of both Moravian and Czech.  Dialects  While the former regional dialects of Bohemia have merged into one interdialect, Common Czech (with some small exceptions in borderlands), the territory of Moravia is still linguistically diversified. This may be due to absence of a single Moravian cultural and political centre (analogous to Prague in Bohemia) for most of the history,BL√ÅHA, Ond≈ôej. Moravsk√Ω jazykov√Ω separatismus: zdroje, c√≠le, slovansk√Ω kontext. In Studia Moravica. Acta Universitatis Palackianae Olomucensis Facultas Philosophica - Moravica. Olomouc : UP v Olomouci, 2005. ISSN 1801-7061. Svazek III. as well as the fact that both of its major cities‚ÄîBrno and Olomouc‚Äîused to be predominantly inhabited by a German-speaking population. The most common classification distinguishes three major groups of Moravian dialects: Central Moravian (Hanakian), Eastern Moravian (Moravian-Slovak) and Silesian (Lach). Some typical phonological differences between the Moravian dialects are shown below on the sentence ‚ÄòPut the flour from the mill in the cart‚Äô: {border=\\"0\\" -  Central Moravian:  D√© m√≥ku ze ml√©na na voz√©k. -  Eastern Moravian:  Daj m√∫ku ze m≈Ç√Ωna na voz√≠k. -  Lach:  Daj muku ze m≈Çyna na vozik. -  -  (Standard Czech:  Dej mouku ze ml√Ωna na voz√≠k.) } Central Moravian An inscription on the fa√ßade of Prostƒõjov castle showing a poem written in Hanakian dialect Central Moravian dialects, or Hanakian dialects (Hanak dialects, Han√° dialects, ), are spoken in the central part of Moravia around Znojmo, T≈ôeb√≠ƒç, Brno, Olomouc, P≈ôerov, Z√°b≈ôeh and ≈†umperk. While the Central Moravian group traditionally contained many dialects native to specific microregions, today's spoken language across Central Moravia is moving towards a unified \\"Common Hanakian dialect\\" (). Features of this group include * A prevalence of the vowels e and √© in place of i/y (ryba > reba, ≈æivot > ≈æevot), √≠/√Ω (ml√Ωn > ml√©n), and ej (nedƒõlej > nedƒõl√©). * O and √≥ in place of u and ou, respectively (ruka > roka, mouka > m√≥ka). By extension, the third person plural ending of verbs which would be -√≠ in standard Czech, and -ej(√≠) or -ou in Common Czech, is -ij√≥, or sometimes just -√≥ in Central Moravian (pros√≠/prosej(√≠) > prosij√≥, hraj√≠/hrajou > hrajij√≥/hraj√≥). The instrumental ending -√≠ is also replaced by -√≥ (s na≈°√≠ koƒçkou > s na≈°√≥ koƒçk√≥). * The ending -a instead of -e for feminine nouns and possessive adjectives is retained, as in Slovak (e.g. na≈°a slepica for Standard Czech na≈°e slepice). * The verb ‚Äúto be‚Äù has the 1st person singular present tense form su rather than jsem. * In contrast to Common Czech, the -l on past tense verbs is always retained (nesl and never nes). The dialects spoken in and around Brno have seen a lot of lexical influence from Hantec slang, a jargon incorporating many German and Yiddish loanwords into the local Central Moravian dialect. Although by the 21st century the slang had greatly declined in use, some vocabulary from Hantec is still used commonly in everyday speech, for example ≈°alina instead of tramvaj for ‚Äútram‚Äù, from German elektrische Linie. The Hanakian dialect has a literary presence. Writers who have written in Hanakian dialect include Alois and Vil√©m Mr≈°t√≠k, Ond≈ôej P≈ôikryl and Jakub Obrovsk√Ω. Written Hanakian dialect often distinguishes between \\"wide\\" or \\"open\\" √™ and √¥ (as in r√™ba, r√¥ka), and \\"closed\\" e and o, to reflect dialects which pronounce these two sounds differently. = Smr≈• kmot≈ôiƒçka (example text) = Czech translation: Eastern Moravian A mural at Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ railway station with two lines of poetry written in an Eastern Moravian dialect A document describing the ethnic composition of Moravia in 1878, along with the Moravian dialects. This writing identifies the Wallachian dialect as a transitional dialect between Czech and Slovak, while the inhabitants of Moravian Slovakia are described as Slovaks. Eastern Moravian dialects are transitional dialects between Czech and Slovak. They are spoken in the strip of land extending from B≈ôeclav to Hodon√≠n, Kyjov, Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ, Zl√≠n and Vset√≠n. The Eastern group contains two dialects of specific interest, the Moravian Wallachian dialect () and the Moravian-Slovak dialect (). Features of Eastern Moravian dialects include: * The distinction between soft l and hard ≈Ç (pronounced [w]) is usually retained (hlava, dƒõlat = h≈Çava, dƒõ≈Çat). By extension, the final -l in past tense verbs is often rendered -u. * aj sometimes retained instead of ej (vejce = vajco, dej = daj). * In contrast to Common Czech, -√Ω- always prevails over -ej- (dobr√Ω, str√Ωc and never dobrej, strejc). * Infinitives end in -≈• rather than -t, as in Slovak (b√Ωt = b√Ω≈•) * The Moravian-Slovak dialect shares several other features with Slovak, including the use of the long ƒ∫ and ≈ï (hloubka = hƒ∫bka, hrnout = oh≈ï≈àat). * Wallachian dialects preserve the present transgressive, which is usually considered archaic in standard Czech aside from in a few arbitrary phrases. Lachian dialects Lachian dialects (Lach dialects, ), spoken in north-eastern Moravia and the adjacent regions of Silesia around Opava, Ostrava, Fr√Ωdek-M√≠stek and Fren≈°t√°t pod Radho≈°tƒõm, are transitional dialects sharing more features of Polish. Defining phonological features include loss of distinction between long and short vowels, a feature colloquially known as ‚Äúkr√°tk√Ω zob√°k‚Äù in Czech (‚Äúshort beak‚Äù), stress shifted to the penultimate syllable of the word, as in Polish, rather than the first syllable, alveolar consonants d, t and n often shifted to their palatal counterparts, and a distinction between ‚Äúhard‚Äù (post-alveolar or retroflex) ≈°, ≈æ, ƒç and ‚Äúsoft‚Äù (alveolo-palatal) ≈õ, ≈∫, ƒá, as in Polish. Silesian dialects also contain many German loanwords unfamiliar to other Czech dialects. The Lachian dialects are closely related to the Cieszyn Silesian dialect, spoken in the area around Karvin√°, ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n and T≈ôinec as well as on the Polish side of the border. Bohemian-Moravian dialects Bohemian-Moravian dialects, or South-eastern Bohemian dialects, spoken in the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands in western Moravia around Daƒçice, Jihlava and ≈Ωƒè√°r nad S√°zavou are a transitional group between dialects of Bohemia and Moravia, sharing some features in common with Common Czech and others more in common with Central Moravian.  Linguistic features  Phonology Moravian dialects preserve numerous archaic phonological features that are no longer used in contemporary Czech, but can still be found in many other Slavic languages.

For instance, Moravian dialects apply a uniform pattern to the 3rd person plural ending of class IV -it verbs, and class III -et verbs, which in standard Czech traditionally varied in an unintuitive fashion: {  - ! Standard Czech (infinitive) !! Han√° dialect !! Moravian-Slovak dialect !! meaning -  pros√≠ (inf. prosit)  prosij√≥  prosij√∫  they beg -  trp√≠ (inf. trpƒõt)  trpij√≥, trpƒõj√≥  trpij√∫, trpƒõj√∫  they suffer -  s√°zej√≠ (inf. s√°zet)  s√°zij√≥, s√°zej√≥  s√°zij√∫, s√°zej√∫  they sow } Moravian dialects also occasionally use prepositions in a different fashion to Standard and Common Czech, usually mirroring usage in Slovak (e.g. nƒõco k j√≠dlu > nƒõco na j√≠dlo for \\"something to eat\\", ) or Polish (e.g. pojƒè ke mnƒõ > choƒè do mƒõ, for \\"come to me\\", ).  Standardisation  Since the end of the 20th century, the private association Moravian Language Institute (√östav jazyka moravsk√©ho), founded by waiter and amateur linguist Jan Kozohorsk√Ω, has made attempts to standardise a literary Moravian language. The movement has been criticised by linguistics professors at Masaryk University in Brno as controversial and with strong political undertones.

Primarily used for mountain stream trout fishing, tenkara is one of the most popular methods of angling among fresh-water mountain anglers in Japan. Tenkara was largely unknown outside Japan until 2009, when the company Tenkara USA, founded by Daniel Galhardo introduced and popularized tenkara outside Japan.Kelleher, Kevin C. M.D. & Ishimura, Misako (2011). Tenkara - Radically Simple, Ultralight Fly Fishing. Lyons Press. Although there are similarities between tenkara and traditional Western-style fly fishing, the two techniques developed independently of each other, with tenkara being purely Japanese in origin. Origins Tenkara fishing originated in Japan at least 200 years ago. The first western reference to tenkara fly-fishing was in 1878 in a book called \\"Diary of climbing Mt. Tateyama\\" written by Ernest Mason Satow, a linguist and British diplomat during the early modernization of Japan.Dr. Hisao Ishigaki, presentation to Catskills Fly Fishing Center and Museum, May 2009 Tenkara fly-fishing originated with professional fishermen in the mountain streams of Japan who found it an effective method of catching the local fish, yamame, iwana and amago. Originally the rod was simply a bamboo/cane rod, which was cut and treated, but unlike contemporary western bamboo rods, they were not \\"manufactured\\" (i.e. split and glued back together). Unlike in the western fly-fishing tradition where anglers used heavy wooden rods, in Japan anglers always used bamboo, which is readily available and very light. Because of its light weight, Japanese anglers were able to use very long bamboo rods and reach as far as needed without the need to develop reels for the short rods developed in the west. Equipment Tenkara fishing can be seen as a streamlined counterpart to western fly- fishing. The equipment is designed to direct focus to the actual fishing and catching of the fish, not to cause a major preoccupation with the equipment. Only a rod, tenkara line and fly are necessary for tenkara fishing (no reel is used). The appeal of tenkara is its elegant simplicity. There are also other advantages of using the long tenkara rods when fishing in mountain streams, primarily the lightness of the line and delicate presentation. A long rod allows for precise placement of the fly on small pools and allows for holding the fly in place on the other side of a current. The other main advantage of using the long tenkara rod is precise control for manipulation of the fly. Rod: A very long and flexible rod (usually telescopic) is used in tenkara fishing. The rods normally range from long. 3.6 m (12 ft) is common. These rods were originally made of bamboo, but are nowadays made with carbon fibre and/or fibre glass. They also have a handle similar to fly-fishing rods that can be made of wood (the more prized rods) or cork. Line: As in fly-fishing, it is the tenkara line that propels the weightless fly forward. In tenkara, the traditional and most commonly used line is a tapered furled line (twisted monofilament), of the same length or slightly shorter than the rod. The main advantage of furled lines is the delicate presentation and ease of casting. Alternatively, a tenkara \\"level\\" line can be used. Level lines are specially formulated fluorocarbon adjusted to the desired length. They are easier to cast against the wind. The traditional tenkara line has a loop of braided line at its thicker end. This braided line is used to tie the tenkara line directly to the tip of the rod by using a cow hitch (aka: girth hitch) knot. The line at the rod's tip needs to have a stopper knot, which will hold the cow hitch in place. It is a very secure method to attach the line. Tippet: This is the same as a regular fly-fishing tippet, and is used to connect the fly to the line (which is too thick to tie directly to the fly). Usually between 30 cm to 1 metre of tippet is added to the end of the line. This is typically referred to in Japanese as \\"hea\\" (for hair). Fly: Artificial flies are used in tenkara fly-fishing. These are tied with thread, feathers and sometimes fur as in western fly-fishing. Traditionally a special reverse hackle wet-fly is used. In Japan it is known as \\"kebari\\". These traditional Japanese flies differ from most Western flies, in that the hackle is tied facing forward. See traditional tenkara flies here My Best Streams by Yoshikazu Fujioka.

History The current church was raised on the foundation of a church built in 1613-15, dedicated to Saint Paraschiva and commissioned by the vornic Ioan Ursu BƒÉrboi. In 1669 this church became a monastery under the authority of Vatopedi monastery on Mount Athos. The church was seriously damaged in 1821 and demolished in 1829. Between 1841 and 1843, the logofƒÉt Dimitrie Sturdza and his family members, with financial assistance from Vatopedi and the efforts of Metropolitan Grigore Irinopoleos, had the current church built on the site of the old one. The architect Andrei Caridi was assisted by the Greek master builders Atanasie and Gheorghe. Biserica BƒÉrboi, crestinortodox.ro The resulting church resembles certain Athonite buildings in form and dimension, Biserici ≈üi mƒÉnƒÉstiri , Ia»ôi City Hall and is the city's only church in the shape of a Greek cross. Biserica BƒÉrboi, Ia»ôi City Hall Tourist Promotion Bureau The church was shaken by the 1977 earthquake, and from 1980‚Äì88, the exterior was restored and the interior paintings and furnishings cleaned. Metropolitan Teoctist ArƒÉpa≈üu began this project, and on 27 November 1988, by then Patriarch of All Romania, he re-consecrated the church. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Monuments. Lista Monumentelor Istorice 2004: Jude≈£ul Ia≈üi Today, in addition to hosting religious services, the church is the headquarters of the local branch of the Romanian Orthodox Women's Society and of the Romanian Orthodox Brotherhood; the latter undertakes philanthropic and cultural activities. Art exhibitions, awards ceremonies, book signings and similar activities take place on the premises. Moreover, every Lazarus Saturday since 1990, thousands of pilgrims have gathered at the church, carrying icons of Christ and making their way toward the Metropolitan Cathedral. Style The church is rectangular in plan and made of valuable stone blocks alternating with rows of brick. To the east, north and south, there are small semicircular apses beneath the top of the walls, flanked by pilasters that rest on bases. The wide central dome, with Neo-Gothic and Romanesque elements, sits above a square base, and is surrounded by four much smaller domes with octagonal bases. The main entrance features an imposing portal held up by eight Doric columns. Above this is a classical facade that also features Doric columns. The church's spacious Byzantine interior is composed of three naves: a central one and two lateral ones, divided by columns of Carrara marble topped by Corinthian capitals. Looking inside, a harmony of arches can be observed: each pair of columns is linked by two or even four arches in perfect symmetry. The iconostasis is carved from wood and gilt. The walls are covered in paintings of saints (including military ones), Biblical scenes, the Madonna and Child and the Four Evangelists. An inscribed tablet records various phases in the church's history. Inside is the crypt of the noble Sturdza family (which includes the grave of Prince Ioan Sturdza), bathed in candlelight, next to that the poet Alecu Russo. The BƒÉrboi Church is also where writer Ion CreangƒÉ served as deacon and lived in the parish house from 1863-65. The bell tower, built in 1726-33 by masons from Padua, has four levels; clocks rest in the uppermost one (uniquely for the city) and bells in the middle two. The lowest level has an exterior of quality stone, well worked and preserved; the other levels have a plaster exterior. It is through the lowest level that one enters the church grounds; the gate is made of decorated cast iron. The tower once contained the library of the writer Costache Conachi. The 19th-century parish house is based on traditional Moldavian monastic houses. It has two floors and a simple plan, with rooms arranged symmetrically about a central hallway. Starting in 1834, it housed Moldavia's first girls' school, founded by Mihail Sturdza.

AAAHC has been granted \\"deemed status\\" to certify ambulatory surgery centers for Medicare by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In 2009, the AAAHC added the Medical home to the types of organizations that it accredits. It offers on-site surveys for organizations seeking Medical Home accreditation or certification.Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care. Medical Home Accreditation . Accessed 2010 March 30. The AAAHC survey model is one of cooperation and education. It is unique in offering accreditation surveys that are conducted by professionals who are actively involved in ambulatory care and have first-hand understanding of the specific issues facing the facilities they survey. Surveyors assess how an organization meets prevailing Standards and share their knowledge and experience with others to help ambulatory service providers maintain high standards. AAAHC is one of three organizations that accredits office-based surgery practices, the others being the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities.Preventing errors in the outpatient setting: A tale of three states. Lapetina, Elizabeth M. and Armstrong, Elizabeth M. 2002. Health Affairs 1(4):26-39. In 2010, the organization extended its accreditation services internationally, beginning with Costa Rica. The program has since expanded to Peru and further expansion is planned. AAAHC announced the launch of a new accreditation program for hospitals in 2012, which will focus on small hospitals and will be offered through a new entity established by AAAHC, the Accreditation Association for Hospitals/Health Systems Inc. (AAHHS). AAAHC continuously reviews its standards and revises current standards and adds new standards as required by the constantly changing health care arena. Each year in August there is a public comment period where these revisions and additions are presented for review and comment by interested parties.

AAAHC surveyors are volunteers: physicians, dentists, podiatrists, pharmacists, nurses and administrators who are actively involved with ambulatory health care. AAAHC offers a three-year term of accreditation. An organization may also receive a deferral or denial of accreditation if compliance is not met. Institute for Quality Improvement In 1999, the AAAHC founded its non- profit subsidiary, the AAAHC Institute for Quality Improvement (AAAHC Institute) to offer performance measurement opportunities and related quality improvement/educational programs to ambulatory health care organizations. The AAAHC Institute has conducted and published more than 70 studies.

When rejected for military service, the sole prototype was converted into an airliner and, known as the Akatsuki-go (ÊöÅÂè∑ ‚Äì \\"Dawn\\"), was operated by Manchukuo National Airways.Taylor 1989, 694 Development and design Kenichi Mitsumara's design was inspired by the Douglas DC-2 that Nakajima was building at the time under licence; a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane powered by twin engines. Construction was of metal throughout, and the main units of the tailwheel undercarriage retracted into the engine nacelles. The bomb load was carried in an internal bay. The prototype LB-2 was completed in March 1936.Mikesh and Abe 1990, p.235. It was considered for production, along with the Mitsubishi G1M, but eventually both were rejected in favour of the Mitsubishi Ka-15, which would be produced as the G3M. Adapted for civil use, the LB-2 prototype's bomb bay was replaced with a fuel tank and a cabin for six passengers was fitted, with the bombardier's position in the nose converted to store luggage. Operational history The converted LB-2, now named Akatsuki-go, was delivered to Manchukuo National Airways in 1937, with it (and two Heinkel He 116s) intended to operate a service to the Soviet Union over the Tian Shan mountains. The outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the undeclared Soviet‚ÄìJapanese Border Wars which culminated in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol stopped these plans, however, and the Akatsuki-go was scrapped at Shenyang in 1941.

This formation is the most fossiliferous portion of the Triassic Marayes Group, and is also the youngest unit of the group, overlying the El Carrizal Formation. An unconformity at the top of the Quebrada del Barro Formation separates it from the Cretaceous-age Los Riscos Formation of the El Gigante Group.Gardini et al., 2009, p.554 Part of the formation may be made into a provincial park following the discovery of the fossils of Ingentia, a giant sauropodomorph dinosaur which helped elucidate the early evolution of sauropods.  Sedimentology  Late Triassic (220 Ma) The Quebrada del Barro Formation formed within a rift basin during a period of renewed fracturing. It encompasses of red sandstones, fine conglomerates, and diamictites. Early hypotheses on the depositional environment proposed that the sediments formed in an alluvial fan or braided river system, while a newer proposal outlines how four different facies within the formation can be used to reconstruct a meandering semiarid floodplain deposited by mudflows and discharging in heterolithic terminal splays.  Fossil content  The fauna of Quebrada del Barro is similar to that of the neighboring Los Colorados Formation which is considered to be from the Norian stage of the Late Triassic.Weishampel, David B; et al. (2004). \\"Dinosaur distribution (Late Triassic, South America).\\" In: Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm√≥lska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 527‚Äì528. . Both formations preserve fossils from groups such as sauropodomorph dinosaurs, cynodonts, and testudinatans. However, Quebrada del Barro is more abundant in sphenodontians (Sphenotitan), tritheledontid cynodonts, and coelophysoid dinosaurs (Lucianovenator), while sauropodomorphs are somewhat less common and aetosaurs are completely absent, in contrast to the Los Colorados Formation. Sphenodontians and cynodonts are also abundant in microfossil assemblages. In addition, the Quebrada del Barro Formation preserves some of the only pterosaur and Dromomeron specimens known from Triassic strata in Argentina. Although the sphenodontian and cynodont-dominated fauna of Quebrada del Barro is akin to that of the Faxinal del Sotorno assemblage of the Brazilian Caturrita Formation, the fauna of the Faxinal del Sotorno assemblage is otherwise indicative of an older part of the Triassic than the Quebrada del Barro Formation.

An enlarged Panther Model 100, the 120 had a reputation for being less reliable with a tendency for rapid clutch wear, problematical roller bearings and heavy oil consumption. As competitors produced modern designs, Panther ran into trouble obtaining supplies of Burman gearboxes and Lucas Magdynos, so production ceased in 1966 and the company was wound up. Development The Panther sloper engine designed by Granville Bradshaw remained unchanged for 25 years and the 650 cc 'heavyweight' had many of the Model 100 components. The increased capacity was achieved by boring out the Model 100 cylinder by 1 mm and increasing the stroke by 6 mm. As well as increased low speed torque this improved acceleration and top end cruising speed. This put additional strain on the main bearings and crankcases, leading to reliability problems. The 120 also suffered with lubrication problems from the large sump cast into the front of the engine. Oil was pumped to the top of the sloper engine but return was erratic and oil consumption very heavy. The main shaft was redesigned with larger ball journal main bearings, A smaller exhaust valve combined with a larger Amal monobloc carburettor gave the Model 120 28 bhp at 4500 rpm, an increase of 4 bhp over the Model 100. Motorcycle sidecars were popular at the end of the 1950s, so the Model 120 was provided with a purpose built sidecar chassis, connected by a three point mounting which provided minimal alignment problems. The sidecar wheel was interchangeable with the motorcycle wheels and had swinging arm suspension with an Armstrong shock absorber. A trailer with a towbar was also provided as an option. The end By 1962 Phelon & Moore were in financial trouble and went into receivership. The Model 120 stayed in production for as long as the supply of spare parts lasted, but they finally ran out in 1966 and the company folded. It wasn't quite the end for the big Panther, however, as they were cheap and economical and continued to sell for another year after production ended. Panther Model 120's are still being maintained and used regularly to this day by enthusiasts.

Gameplay It is played with two-sided (black and white) chips, also called discs, on a board. The player can choose between black or white chips. Games are either player versus computer or player versus player. The goal is to end the game with as many chips showing your color as possible. To do this, players must sandwich their opponents' chip(s) between a piece of their own color already on the board, and the piece being played. The game has four skill levels when playing the computer, as well as a hidden fifth level if you beat the computer on level four. There is supposedly a slot machine game that is revealed when pressing Select + A at the main menu screen (the word slot will appear atop the screen and the game is said to start after you complete a two player game), but some users have reported that nothing happens after the word \\"slot\\" shows up.

History A church has been located on this site as early as the 11th century when the Normans built a small, rectangular chapel. It is not known if this was the result of a rebuild of a previous church. A church on this site has been recorded in documents since 1213. The current St Nicolas's Church dates from the early 13th century, and the spire was constructed between 1446 and 1475. The Norman building was demolished in the 14th century when a new nave, both aisles and the chancel arch were constructed. In the 17th century, almost the whole of the south aisle was re-built, the chancel was re-roofed and the low pitched roof that covered the nave from the 15th century was replaced by a much steeper version. Both north aisle and south aisle were given four separate, high pitched roofs set side-by-side. A parish was assigned to the church in 1846. The church was restored in 1863 by Ewan Christian and again in 1871 by W. J. Hopkins. It is a Grade I listed building. In 1898 the church started a mission in Cotteridge which later became St Agnes' Church, Cotteridge. The Revd W. V. Awdry, author of The Railway Series including Thomas the Tank Engine was a curate from 1940 to 1946. The church stands next to the historic buildings of Saracen's Head, recently restored and named Saint Nicolas Place.

During his tenure at the newspaper, he consistently championed traditionalism and decried modernism. Of the latter, he once wrote, \\"It will someday prove a kind of Victorian 'dud,' with a difference, obviously, but a 'dud' just the same.\\" In addition to his work as a critic, he penned the inscription above the statue of Abraham Lincoln in the Lincoln Memorial: \\"In this temple, as in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever.\\"  Early life  Cortissoz was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Francisco Emmanuel Cortissoz, an Englishman of Spanish descent, and Julia da Costa Mauri, from Martinique. He trained as an architect, spending six years working at the firm of McKim, Mead, and White, starting at the age of 16, before joining the staff of the Commercial Advertiser. In 1891, he joined the staff of the New York Tribune, writing on culture, and eventually became the art editor. He had been interested in art as a young child, but never formally studied or practiced it, instead having skill with words, thus leading to career as an art critic, in his own words, \\"by spontaneous combustion\\". However, the hectic life of a journalist and the pressure of trying to establish the Tribune as a cultural leader led to a mental breakdown, or neurasthenia as he was diagnosed. Although he soon recovered after a trip around Cape Horn, he suffered from anxiety and psychosomatic ailments for the remainder of his life.  Work as a critic  As a critic, Cortissoz saw his role to be one who fosters an appreciation of art in the common man, and not just paintings. He wrote extensively about jewelry, rare book designs, architecture, furniture, and interior design. He considered art as a whole to be central to society's well-being. He also frequently remarked that beauty could be found anywhere. Cortissoz was so influential that his praise was eagerly sought by artists, and the organizers of the landmark 1913 Armory Show were worried about what he might think. Cortissoz argued against modernism on both technical and cultural grounds. He found abstract art to be ugly and rejected modernism's idea that the work did not have to represent reality. In 1923, he drew a comparison between the surge of prominent European modernists arriving on American shores with the hot button issue of immigration, coining the derisive term \\"Ellis Island art\\" in an attempt to denigrate the newcomers' rising status in the art world. (The term did not catch on.) He also detested modernists' tendency to be dismissive of the past and of those who disliked their work. This attitude, Cortissoz felt, would cause people to associate art with the irrational and bizarre and thus lose interest. Over the years, Cortissoz criticized in this manner Cubism, German Expressionism, Dada, Surrealism, and abstract expressionism. He felt artists attached to these movements, such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, and Piet Mondrian were egotists. In 1927, he wrote, \\"Sooner or later these silly egotists will go to the scrap heap. But in the meantime they are ruining the younger generation.\\" He did, however, have praise for American modernists who used traditional techniques, such as Arthur B. Davies, Guy P√®ne du Bois, and Georgia O'Keeffe.  Personal life  In 1897, Cortissoz married Ellen MacKay Hutchinson, a literary editor at the Tribune. She died in August 1933, and the couple had no children. Cortissoz died of a heart ailment in Manhattan.

It is a single, unified platform which offers the ability to do business directly with consumers (B2C), with businesses (B2B), indirectly through channel partners (indirect business models), or all of these simultaneously. WebSphere Commerce is a customizable, scalable and high availability solution built on the Java - Java EE platform using open standards, such as XML, and Web services. Formerly a product of IBM, the product was sold to HCL Technologies in July 2019. WebSphere Commerce is sometimes referred to as WCS, however this abbreviation was originally used as a reference to the platform when it was named WebSphere Commerce Suite. Use of the abbreviation continued with users and solution implementers after the platform was renamed to WebSphere Commerce with the announcement of WebSphere Commerce V5.4. Versions 1\\\\. The first version of the platform was introduced in 1996,IBM Archives 1996, IBM. Accessed on 2010-06-10. during the emergence of e-commerce with a product called Net.Commerce (V1.0 and subsequently V2.0, V3.1, and V3.2) that was first deployed to sell event ticket and merchandise for the 1996 Olympic Games. In 2001 Net.Commerce was renamed to WebSphere Commerce Suite, releasing versions V4.1 and V5.1. In 2002 WebSphere Commerce V5.4 was released, followed by V5.5 in 2003, V5.6 in 2004 and V5.6.1 in 2005.

The new species was discovered by University of Otago and University of Adelaide scientists comparing the foot bones of 500-year-old, 100-year-old and modern specimens of penguins. They were initially believed to have all belonged to the yellow-eyed penguin (Megadyptes antipodes), a species that has been threatened since human settlement. However, the 500-year-old subfossil bones yielded different DNA. According to lead researcher Sanne Boessenkool, Waitaha penguins \\"were around 10% smaller than the yellow-eyed penguin. The two species are very closely related, but we can't say if they had a yellow crown.\\" \\"Our findings demonstrate that yellow-eyed penguins on mainland New Zealand are not a declining remnant of a previous abundant population, but came from the subantarctic relatively recently and replaced the extinct Waitaha penguin,\\" said team member Dr Jeremy Austin, deputy director of the Australasian Centre for Ancient DNA. As the local MƒÅori people have no record of this different species, it is estimated to have perished between c. 1300 and 1500, soon after Polynesian settlers arrived in New Zealand. While it is currently unclear precisely how the species became extinct, Boessenkool says they were probably eaten by the settlers. \\"The fact we find these bones in archaeological sites, villages or settlements, suggests hunting played a role. The birds were an easy target, easy to take and there were never very many of them.\\" After their extinction, their range was occupied by yellow-eyed penguins, previously most abundant in the subantarctic islands further south. The decrease in sea lion populations after human settlement may also have eased their expansion. Another coauthor, Dr Phil Seddon, said \\"these unexpected results highlight ... the dynamic nature of ecosystem change, where the loss of one species may open up opportunities for the expansion of another.\\" The report was published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Early life and family  The daughter of activist John Hippolite, Katene is of Ngati Koata, Ngati Kuia, Ngati Toa and Kai Tahu descent. She grew up in Nelson and was educated at Waimea College and Church College of New Zealand. A lawyer, she spent six years as managing solicitor at Te Ratonga Ture / MƒÅori Legal Services. Katene is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Member of Parliament  Prior to the 2008 general election, Katene initially missed out on the MƒÅori Party candidacy for Te Tai Tonga to Monte Ohia. However she became the candidate following Ohia's death.Rahui Katene to stand for MƒÅori Party in Te Tai Tonga She defeated incumbent Labour MP Mahara Okeroa with an election night majority of 684.Election results 2008 In 2009 her Te RƒÅ o Matariki Bill/Matariki Day Bill, which would have made Matariki a public holiday, was drawn from the member's ballot.

Since leaving Parliament Katene has remained active in the MƒÅori Party and was briefly in the media spotlight for failing to remove her designation as an MP from social media, a revelation discovered after she appeared in new articles criticising her replacement, Rino Tirikatene who she argued was not listening to the electorate. In early 2013 Katene put her hat in the ring to replace retiring co-leader Tariana Turia who had announced she would step down before the 2014 General election. However, Marama Fox was subsequently chosen as Turia's replacement following the general election.

J. Gordon Coogler (December 3, 1865 ‚Äì September 9, 1901), or John Brown Gordon Coogler, was a self-taught American poet who achieved notoriety during his lifetime as a prolific producer of bad verse. Essayist H.L. Mencken is credited with assuring Coogler's lasting fame as a poetaster by mocking him as an example of the supposedly poor state of arts and letters in the American South. Life Coogler was born in South Carolina and never left the state. He opened a job printing shop advertising \\"Poems Written While You Wait.\\" Although his verses attracted ridicule, he sought to promote his business by distributing self-published booklets of original poems. According to his obituary in the Columbia State newspaper, Coogler published five thousand short collections of original verse during his lifetime, besides two versions of his book-length collection titled Purely Original Verse.Bryan Giemza, \\"J. Gordon Coogler,\\" in Southern Writers: A New Biographical Dictionary, edited by Joseph M. Flora, Amber Vogel, and Bryan Albin Giemza (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 2006): p. 79. Coogler's verse attracted mocking attention from prominent American magazines, including Puck and Munsey's Magazine. Coogler once complained in verse about what he considered the unfairness of literary critics: > Oh you critics! ‚Äî If an author errs in a single line, That line you'll > surely quote, And will give it as a sample fair Of all he ever wrote. Legacy Nearly two decades after Coogler's death, H.L. Mencken selected the following brief poem as the motto of his 1920 essay \\"The Sahara of the Bozart‚Äù: > Alas! for the South, her books have grown fewer‚Äî She never was much given to > literature. Mencken went on to mock Southern literature by crowning Coogler as \\"the last bard of Dixie.\\" From the 1890s into the 20th century, newspapers quoted that unintentionally humorous couplet, often from memory and in garbled form. Little else about Coogler was remembered besides the one couplet and his identity as a southerner.Edmund Pearson, \\"The Tribe of Gifted Hopkins,\\" in Queer Books (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, Doran & Co., 1928): 77. In the late 20th century conservative political commentator Emmett Tyrrell invented the annual J. Gordon Coogler Award as a booby prize for the \\"worst book of the year.\\" The announcement of the prize has appeared annually in conservative organs including Human Events and The American Spectator.See e.g. R. Emmett Tyrell, Jr., \\"Coogler: Worst in the Business,\\" American Spectator 35 (1) (Jan./Feb 2002): p. 22. According to literary critic Bryan Giemza, other \\"mock-serious Coogler societies\\" have granted awards for bad writing. Legacy in South Carolina Coogler's reputation has been less negative in his home state, where some have expressed appreciation for his naive verse. Purely Original Verse was reprinted in 1974 by Vogue Press of Columbia, South Carolina. The town of Blythewood, South Carolina held a \\"Coogler Festival\\" in the poet's honor in November 1983. In 1985, Irene LaBorde Neuffer published Coogler Revisited, a book devoted to the poet. The personal papers of J. Gordon Coogler are housed at the University of South Carolina.

The act was signed on March 18, 1869, and was mainly supported by the Republican Party, notably Senator John Sherman. Background Prior to the Civil War, the U.S. operated on a gold standard in practice. Bank notes were legal tender issued by state banks which could be exchanged for an amount of gold at any bank. Both gold and bank notes circulated as mediums of exchange. On February 25, 1862, the U.S. passed the First Legal Tender Act to help finance the Civil War. The act changed the economy to a fiduciary standard based on a fiat currency called United States Notes, or more popularly, greenbacks. Unlike bank notes, greenbacks were not backed by any metallic standard and functioned as a \\"loan without interest.\\"Mitchell, Wesley Clair. A History of the Greenbacks. Chicago: The University of Chicago press, 1903. p. 404. Greenbacks were issued as an immediate, short-term relief for the country's growing demand for currency. The issuance of greenbacks and the sale of government bonds to finance the war were led by the Secretary of the Treasury at the time, Salmon P. Chase.Geisst, Charles R. Wall Street: a History. New York: Oxford University Press, 1997. Until 1879, gold, bank notes, and greenbacks were used as mediums of exchange and had free floating exchange rates. Under a gold standard, paper notes are convertible into preset, fixed quantities of gold. After the Civil War, there was debate over whether to keep the greenback standard or to revert to the gold standard. During the Civil War, the nation experienced a strong period of inflation. The price level in the U.S. almost doubled between 1861 and 1865, with harmful implications on the exchange rate. Inflation increased the exchange rate with England, making the price of British pounds more expensive. There was concern that if the pre-war gold standard was put in place during this inflationary period, people would cash out their U.S. currency for gold to buy British goods. The flow of gold out of the country would slow the economy and lead to unemployment.Walton, Gary M, and Hugh Rockoff. History of the American Economy. 11th ed. Mason, Ohio: Thomson/South-Western, 2010. Some Republicans pushed for a gold standard early on. They believed that creditors who supported the war should be paid back in gold, the way they were expected to be paid back. The Republicans also believed that the government should not be in charge of managing currency and that the gold standard did not allow government to intervene in the economy. It was thought by all that the gold standard would also be a good move from an international perspective, since the U.S. would appear stable, and its system would be compatible with its major trading partner, England, who also operated on a gold standard. Consequences Over time, the price level and exchange rate began to fall. Congress decided on a severe monetary contraction to lower the price level so they could reinstate the gold standard during the Contraction Act of 1866 before easing the policy in 1868. The passing of the Public Credit Act of 1869 was the first definitive piece of legislation that moved the U.S. toward reinstating a gold standard. However, the act included no explicit dates, people, or actions intended to pay back the bondholders in gold. The U.S. did not officially operate on the gold standard again until the Resumption Act of 1875. See also *Contraction Act of 1866 *John Sherman *Gold Standard *Salmon P.

His best-known singles, \\"Don't Belong\\" and \\"Wasted\\", were included on Tiesto's in Search of Sunrise-series in 2007 and 2008. Career Early life And Duguid was born in G√ºtersloh, Germany on 16 November 1982. He moved to England before relocating to Scotland around 1990, where he has lived since. He started producing around age 14, after experimenting with keyboards and pianos for several years since he was 10. He released his first single \\"Hypocrisy\\" on Black Hole Recordings in 2006 and reached 5th place in the Dutch Dance Charts. His next single, Don't Belong, was received and featured on In Search of Sunrise 6: Ibiza. In October 2007, before \\"Wasted\\" was created, Andy was asked by Black Hole to create an album so it would be released a year later. Rising Beginnings After being asked to create an album, Duguid released his single \\"\\"Wasted\\" in 2008 which was included on In Search of Sunrise 7: Asia. The song became an opening track with Banyan Tree's Feel The Sunrise. In October 2008, Duguid released his first studio album Believe, which features long-time friend Iris Morrison (Leah) also known as Alanah, Mr. Sam and his friend Solarstone, Esmaye, who is also part of Black Hole's repertoire, Donna & Anthony, I-Fan, and Julie Thompson, whom he is currently helping to produce her first album to be released on Black Hole after her return to the dance scene with Ti√´sto's \\"Somewhere Inside\\" which had also appeared on in Search of Sunrise 6: Ibiza. It also included Duguid's remix once it was released as a single on Magik Muzik. After the release of Duguid's album and the time of the his brother's death, he confirmed that he wrote White Sands together with his brother which is the last track on Duguid's album. Speaking to Vh1 India, Duguid said, \\"This track means so much. You can lose pictures or videos of your loved ones but this is something that will be around forever and it makes me very proud of my brother.\\" In December 2008, he joined Radio Volum as part of their program on Saturday nights from 10:00 to 12:00. During the first 45 minutes, Duguid opens his set followed 15 minutes of \\"Chance\\" in which Andy lets unsigned artists show some of their own tunes and their mixing abilities. From 11:00 to 11:30 he plays a selected number of classic anthems from the electronic dance music scene. The last 30 minutes of the program include his closing set which is similar to the opening. The radio show is now syndicated to a number of stations worldwide, including Dance Paradise Brazil, to a listenership of over two million people. In October 2013, Duguid told Vh1 India that After Dark Music was put on hold to be restructured and would be fully up and running by the Christmas season. Dedication to Olivia Downie The track \\"7even\\" featuring vocals from Jaren Cerf was released on 14 October 2013, and is the fifth single off of Duguid's second album On the Edge. On his Facebook page, Duguid explained that the song and music video are based on the story of Olivia Downie, a young girl who died after a long battle with neuroblastoma, an aggressive form of cancer. Her story made national headlines while her parents raised funds for her treatment. When the song became available for download on digital music stores, Andy announced that he would donate all of the royalties he earned off of the track to cancer research in Olivia's name.

It is a Grade I listed building. History The lords of the manor in the 14th century were the Stanshaw family and one of them began the building of the wooden manor house. In the 15th a new stone building was constructed incorporating some of the fbric from the earlier building. In the 16th century Little Sodbury Manor was the home of Sir John Walsh who employed William Tyndale as chaplain and tutor to his grandchildren in 1522-3; by tradition he began his translation of the Bible in his bedroom here. In 1556 the house was damaged by an electrical storm, which killed Sir John Walsh's son Maurice and his family. In 1608 it was sold to Thomas Stephens whose son demolished the southern gatehouse and some of the outbuildings. He also installed a new staircase and continued the remodelling of the interior. Robert Packer of Donnington Castle bought Little Sodbury Manor in 1728, following further storm damage in 1703 after which the house was remodelled. It then passed down through absentee landlords and by the 19th century had fallen into disrepair. The Duke of Beaufort inherited the house in 1910 and sold it to Lord Hugh Grosvenor and in 1919 Baron de Tuyll. They employed the architect Sir Harold Brakspear for restoration. Architecture The stone building has Cotswold stone slates on the roof. The Great Hall, cross passage and porch remain from the 15th and 16th century building. The kitchen and south west wing are from the 16th century. To the north is the two-storey, five-bay wing from the 17th century. The hall roof is supported by original timbers resting on corbels carved as shield-bearing angels, with four tiers of carved windbraces. The hall screen is original but the timber framing above this was added to create separate rooms. The grounds include a grassed terrace with hedges and stone walls and a tudor bowling green. There are extensive grassed areas, planeted with trees including Scots pine, birch, copper hazel, blue cedar and handkerchief trees, surrounding the house. Little can now be seen of the ponds in the north-west corner of the garden.

He was most recently to be heard on 4fm, having presented shows on RT√â 2fm for much of his career until 2005 and then a show on Galway Bay FM. O'Callaghan is an outspoken supporter of suicide and depression-related topics, having had previous personal experience of these throughout his adult life. He has written books dealing with such topics, and was a supporter of the Irish suicide charity Console Suicide charity Ireland before its closure, representing them in D√°il √âireann debates on at least one occasion. O'Callaghan is a qualified clinical psychotherapist. In 2010, O'Callaghan spoke out against cocaine use following the death of Gerry Ryan, a former colleague and friend. He acknowledged that he had known of Ryan's cocaine use for 16 years and received criticism and intimidation after speaking about this in public. Career Radio O'Callaghan started with small pirates such as Radio Dublin. He then was a presenter on \\"superpirate\\" Radio Nova in the early 1980s, followed by Sunshine Radio (briefly), later Energy 103FM and Q102 (briefly). He spent a few years on UK radio, after his spell with Sunshine Radio in 1983, starting with offshore pirate Radio Caroline. After Q102, O'Callaghan joined legal Irish radio with Millennium Radio and then in 1989 he moved to the newly relaunched \\"2fm\\" ‚Äì an attempt by RT√â to steal some of the thunder of the recently departed Superpirates. He then presented the very popular \\"Gareth O'Callaghan in the afternoon\\" show which was similar in theme, tone and content to The Steve Wright in the afternoon show on BBC Radio 1 of the late '80s and early '90s.This show was a huge success gaining O'Callaghan widespread popularity all over Ireland by offering a brand and style of commercial radio that was more reminiscent of Radio Nova in Dublin at the very height of its popularity. O'Callaghan left RT√â 2fm's afternoon show, having previously presented the breakfast show on the station (replacing Ian Dempsey). His afternoon slot is now occupied by Rick O'Shea's eponymously named show. After leaving 2fm, O'Callaghan took some time out from radio to pursue a career in psychology before being named presenter of the breakfast show on Galway Bay FM. On 27 February 2009 Gareth launched Ireland's newest commercial independent Quasi-national radio station 4fm where he was the morning show host before moving to the afternoon slot.Veterans back on the airwaves as 4FM launches Irish Examiner, February 28, 2009. Before Gay Byrne's retirement from The Gay Byrne Show in 1998, he was helped a bit by O'Callaghan but O'Callaghan left him after getting fed up and went to RT√â 2fm instead. Des Cahill had to help Byrne after that. Writing O'Callaghan has been writing since 1995. To date, he is the author of six best-selling works ‚Äì five novels and a memoir. He has contributed two stories to the New Island Open Door series, entitled Joe's Wedding and Stray Dog. New Island publishes literary fiction, poetry, drama, biography, politics and social affairs. O'Callaghan wrote A Day Called Hope: A Journey Beyond Depression about his own personal experience of severe depression. The book detailed how, as soon as left his radio job each day, he would retreat to his bed, sometimes with thoughts of suicide. It became one of the biggest-selling books in Ireland in 2003, and continues to sell in huge numbers. It has been published in 15 countries, and translated into 10 languages. O'Callaghan is also a regular contributor to many of the national newspapers in Ireland, having written regularly for The Irish Times, the Sunday Independent and the Evening Herald. He is currently writing a sequel to A Day Called Hope, and is also said to be working on a new novel. Personal life He lives in Cork, dividing his time between Dublin and London. He has three daughters called Kerri O'Callaghan, Katie O'Callaghan and Aibh√≠n O'Callaghan. Health In March 2018, O'Callaghan announced to listeners of Neil Prendeville's Cork's Red FM show that he had developed Parkinson's disease (PD). He said: \\"I was tripping. I was dropping things in work. When you drop a cup of coffee literally out of your hand and it scalds your foot and people look at you and think 'what's wrong with him?' I fell out of the bath one morning and I didn't understand why I fell out. I have noticed changes in you have to stop and choose words. It is not that your speech changes the way you transport the words it happens in a different way. When I was diagnosed I was told I have had this for a couple of years which in a way was a relief to me. There were times over the last few years where I thought I was going mad. I couldn't figure out what it was.\\" O'Callaghan mentioned that, prior to his diagnosis, he had read a Daily Mail article in which DJ David Jensen spoke of his experience of Parkinson's. O'Callaghan retired from radio in August 2018 after being diagnosed with the neurodegenerative illness multiple system atrophy (MSA), an incurable and even more rare disease (less than 3,500 people were at the time thought to be enduring the condition in the whole of Ireland and the UK). In an online post, he wrote \\"It is a rare disease, very progressive and sadly incurable. I thought I might have been able to continue working as normal for another few months but, unfortunately, the pace and the painful decline of this awful thing has really taken us by surprise.\\" References  External links * Gareth O'Callaghan at 4fm Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:20th-century Irish people Category:21st- century Irish people Category:4fm presenters Category:Galway Bay FM presenters Category:Irish non-fiction writers Category:Irish novelists Category:RT√â 2fm presenters Category:RT√â Radio 1 presenters Category:RT√â television presenters Category:Irish male novelists Category:People with Parkinson's disease ","title":"Gareth O'Callaghan"},{"id":"20299034","text":"Multichannel News is a magazine and website published by Future US that covers multichannel television and communications providers, such as cable operators, satellite television firms and telephone companies, as well as emerging Internet video and communication services.

Dawkins (born July 29, 1950) is an American politician and attorney from Minnesota. Dawkins is a former member of the Minnesota House of Representatives from Saint Paul. Running as a Democrat, Dawkins was first elected in 1986 to represent District 65A, and was reelected every two years until opting not to seek reelection in 2002. In 1993, he ran an unsuccessful campaign for mayor of Saint Paul against Norm Coleman. He married Ellen Anderson, a Minnesota state senator from St. Paul, in 1995; they divorced in 2018. He was the Green Party of Minnesota nominee for Minnesota Attorney General in the 2014 election, earning 1.5% of the vote and restoring the party's minor-party status.  Biography  Originally from Chicago, Dawkins came to Minnesota in the late 1960s to attend the Hamline University School of Law in St. Paul. During law school, he moved to Philadelphia to work with homeless youth, but intended to return to Minnesota. In 1978, he established a neighborhood law practice in Saint Paul's Frogtown neighborhood and set a personal goal of gaining election to the Legislature within 10 years. Before joining the Legislature, Dawkins said it was important to him that he get to know the neighborhood and its residents' concerns, so he volunteered for a number of community organizations and the Minnesota Democratic‚ÄìFarmer‚ÄìLabor Party. First elected to the House in a November 1987 special election, Dawkins filled the District 65A seat vacated by former Speaker of the House Fred Norton (DFL-St. Paul) upon Norton's appointment to the state Court of Appeals. After leaving the legislature in 2003, Dawkins led the department of Neighborhood Housing and Property Improvement for the city of Saint Paul for several years. In 2006, he began working as an attorney at the law firm of Mansfield, Tanick, and Cohen. In June 2014 Dawkins announced that he would run for Minnesota Attorney General under the Green Party banner. If Dawkins had won 5 percent of the vote, it would have elevated the Minnesota Green Party to the major-party status it once held in Minnesota. Minnesota House of Representatives Dawkins served on several House committees during his time in the Minnesota House, including those governing capital investment, family and civil law, energy and regulated industries, environment and natural resources, financial institutions and insurance, housing, jobs and economic development, and taxes. He also sponsored youth works legislation to provide college tuition to students volunteering in communities, much like the AmeriCorps program; the Great Northern Corridor economic development project; and a homeownership program for urban and low-income residents. Dawkins also sponsored several measures in an effort to raise awareness of drug crimes and prostitution problems in Frogtown and to study racial bias in the state court system. Positions Money in Politics As a DFL State Legislator for 15 years, Dawkins saw firsthand how money dictated what got done in government: > I had enough seniority as a democrat to be the tax chair in the Minnesota > Legislature but I was told 'Dawkins you'll never be the tax chair 'cause you > pissed off the real-estate industry, you pissed off the bankers, and you > tried to do the tax stuff the right way for the little guys and they‚Äôre not > going to let you be the tax chair'. I was told that I'm not going to be the > tax chair unless I can get these big lobbyists to support me to be the tax > chair. Minnesota's no different than Washington; big money runs our country > on every level these days. > Who gets to run, who gets elected, what gets enacted, who gets served by > what gets enacted is all ruled by big money these days. I would get the > million dollars once in a while for a little housing program or start a > youth program ... but when you're talking about the hundreds of millions of > dollars that's at play all the time in politics; if the insurance companies > don't like your bill then it ain't gonna move, if you don't write something > in so that they come out o.k. the bankers and the finance industries and the > lenders will put a stop to it, it's up and down the line. Sulfide/Copper Nickel Mining Dawkins is strongly opposed to the Polymet Mining Corporation and Twin Metals Minnesota LLC proposed sulfide/copper- nickel mines in northern Minnesota. Because of the threat of acid mine drainage to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and the short term nature of the jobs these mines will create, Dawkins had this to say: > I don't think we need to do any sort of sulfide mining, period ... the whole > thing is about profit for foreign investors, and to then argue there's a few > jobs in the mining industry, well, compare that to the amount of jobs we'd > get if we keep doing renewables and sustainables. Until we have that debate, > I'm totally against. Ranked Choice Voting Dawkins supported the instant-runoff voting (ranked choice voting) ballot initiative early on in the city of Saint Paul. With his Minnesota Attorney General campaign, Dawkins is endorsing the idea of a statewide adoption of ranked choice voting.

The free energy surface along the chosen coordinate is referred to as the potential of mean force (PMF). If the system of interest is in a solvent, then the PMF also incorporates the solvent effects. General description The PMF can be obtained in Monte Carlo or Molecular Dynamics simulations which examine how a system's energy changes as a function of some specific reaction coordinate parameter. For example, it may examine how the system's energy changes as a function of the distance between two residues, or as a protein is pulled through a lipid bilayer. It can be a geometrical coordinate or a more general energetic (solvent) coordinate. Often PMF simulations are used in conjunction with umbrella sampling, because typically the PMF simulation will fail to adequately sample the system space as it proceeds.A. R. Leach, Molecular Modelling: Principles and Applications, 2001, Mathematical description The Potential of Mean Force of a system with N particles is by construction the potential that gives the average force over all the configurations of all the n+1...N particles acting on a particle j at any fixed configuration keeping fixed a set of particles 1...n ::- abla_jw^{(n)} \\\\, = \\\\, \\\\frac {\\\\int e^{-\\\\beta V} (- abla_j V)d q_{n+1}\\\\dots dq_N } {\\\\int e^{-\\\\beta V} d q_{n+1}\\\\dots dq_N} ,~ j =1,2,\\\\dots,n Above, - abla_jw^{(n)} is the averaged force, i.e. \\"mean force\\" on particle j. And w^{(n)} is the so-called potential of mean force. For n=2 , w^{(2)}(r) is the average work needed to bring the two particles from infinite separation to a distance r . It is also related to the radial distribution function of the system, g(r) , by:See Chandler, section 7.3 :: g(r) = e^{-\\\\beta w^{(2)}(r)}  Application  The potential of mean force w^{(2)} is usually applied in the Boltzmann inversion method as a first guess for the effective pair interaction potential that ought to reproduce the correct radial distribution function in a mesoscopic simulation. Lemkul et al. have used steered molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the potential of mean force to assess the stability of Alzheimer's amyloid protofibrils. Gosai et al. have also used umbrella sampling simulations to show that potential of mean force decreases between thrombin and its aptamer (a protein-ligand complex) under the effect of electrical fields.

He played 21 league games before he was transferred to top-flight Blackpool in March 1959. He went on to make 145 appearances for the club, before he was signed by Stanley Matthews for Port Vale in September 1967. He was allowed to spend summer 1968 in Canada with Vancouver Royals, who were then coached by Ferenc Pusk√°s. He returned to help Vale to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1969‚Äì70, and was also named as the club's Player of the Year. He later served as player-manager of Northwich Victoria in 1971‚Äì72. Playing career Tranmere Rovers John Green was born and grew up near to Warrington, like his lifelong friend Roger Hunt; both played as amateurs for Stockton Heath before becoming professional footballers. Green began his professional career with Tranmere Rovers, signing in February 1958, with the club in the Third Division North. At the end of the 1957‚Äì58 season the Third Division North and South were dissolved and replaced by the Third Division and the Fourth Division.

Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887‚Äì1992, Breedon Books Sport, p. 296 In 1961‚Äì62, Green made nine league appearances. He also scored his first goals for the club. The first came on 14 April 1962, in a 3‚Äì2 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday. A second followed seven days later, this time in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Manchester City at Bloomfield Road. Green also made two appearances for the club in the League Cup: firstly in their third-round tie at Workington on 5 November, his strike being the only goal of the game; and secondly in their semi-final second leg game at home to Norwich City on 16 April 1962, which proved to be their elimination match.Calley, Roy (1992).

Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887‚Äì1992, Breedon Books Sport, p. 306 For 1966‚Äì67, Green's final season with the club, the midfielder became one of two Greens in the team, after the arrival of Tony Green, a Scot, from Newcastle United. The Englishman made fifteen league appearances, a third of which occurred under new manager Stan Mortensen. Green's final appearance for the club took place in the penultimate league game of the season, a 3‚Äì1 defeat at home to West Bromwich Albion on 6 May 1967. After maintaining a First Division status during Green's eight seasons with the club, Blackpool were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the campaign.Calley, Roy (1992). Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887‚Äì1992, Breedon Books Sport, p. 308 Green had played a total of 145 league and cup games for Blackpool, scoring a total of 11 goals in all competitions. Port Vale In September 1967, Green was signed for Fourth Division Port Vale by Stanley Matthews, who Green had admired from childhood and alongside whom he had played towards the end of Matthews' playing career with Blackpool. He made a 'superb' start to his Vale career, and was seen as one of the club's most skilful players. However, he soon lost his first team place, and made just eleven appearances in 1967‚Äì68. Green then spent May to October 1968 with Vancouver Royals. Although Green was originally recruited by Bobby Robson, by the time he joined Vancouver Royals, Robson had been replaced as coach by Ferenc Pusk√°s, who made Green captain for his season with the Canadian club. While there he notched 4 goals in 25 matches as the Royals struggled in the North American Soccer League, and finished bottom of the Pacific Division. Returning to Vale Park for the rest of the 1968‚Äì69 campaign, he found himself working under a new manager in Gordon Lee. Green struggled with his fitness but played twelve games, finding himself on the scoresheet in home wins against Newport County and Chester. He then helped the club to win promotion in 1969‚Äì70, and was an ever-present with 46 league and six cup appearances. He was given the club's Player of the Year award for his contribution to the campaign. He said that \\"It came as a complete surprise, all the lads were sure it would be John James\\". However, he could not translate this success over to the 1970‚Äì71 Third Division campaign, and new signings Brian Horton and Tony Lacey established themselves in the first eleven. He was not offered a new contract at the end of the season. Green had played a total of 98 league and cup games for Port Vale, scoring a total of 9 goals in all competitions. Later career Green rounded off his career in professional football as player-manager of Northern Premier League side Northwich Victoria for the latter part of the 1971‚Äì72 season.

History Al Hinshaw signed on WIFM-FM in Elkin in 1949, and added an AM station several years later. Both stations had difficulties but they survived. James Childress bought the stations in 1954. WIFM-AM was a daytime-only station, but the FM station aired programming at night. The AM and FM stations aired the same programming (the AM went off the air at night) until FCC rules prohibited this more than a few hours a day. By this time, enough people had FM radios that separate programming became possible. In the mid-70s, Leon Reece's \\"Good Morning Show\\" and \\"Open Mike\\" aired on both stations. The AM aired pop/rock music. In the early 80s the FM studio moved and the AM station took over the former FM studio. WIFM-AM later became WJOS (for Jonesville, where the station moved) and its format was Southern gospel from the late 80s until 1995. John Wishon was station manager and morning host most of those years.

This can be caused by official or claimant error or neglect, or simply because the provisional payments were based on out of date information. This article is solely about overpayment, not about details of the tax system as a whole. Since the implementation of the Tax Credit Act 2002 (TCA 2002) TCA 2002 HMRC consider overpaid tax credit in the same light as unpaid income tax, and can use the full extent of their powers to pursue recovery (aka repayment) Records for each completed year (all awards up to date and closed) show that one third of all tax credit claims have been overpaid.PO report page 5Official HMRC Tax Credit Statistics section In fact 1/3 are also underpaid, and only 1/3 paid correctly on average. {  border=\\"1\\" - !

Customer Error Applicants delaying informing HMRC of changes of circumstances (CoC's) such as children leaving a household, ending employment, or splitting from a partner. This also includes applicants giving incorrect information on making/updating claims, or failing to respond in a timely manner to deadlines in the Tax Credit process. Annualised taxation calculations Because entitlement to tax credits depends on the level of income received for the tax year it is being paid, the true award cannot be finalised until the end of that year, as such all payments are ‚Äòprovisional‚Äô until an end of year calculation. The result is that an overpayment can be discovered at the end (or even during) an award. Inflexibility of the system HMRC did not anticipate claimants' incomes and circumstances would vary so much ‚Äòin year‚Äô. The system operates retroactively, so delays allowing for changes to process mean overpayment can occur even if changes are reported timely. The resulting numerous and confusing paperwork amendments to claims caused additional problems. The Tax Credit Office initially took the decision not to require or act on notifications of circumstance changes ‚Äòin year‚Äô anyway, and instead save this information until the end of the year to factor into a single entitlement recalculation. This meant overpayments built up even where claimants notified HMRC of all changes of circumstance (CoC's) Provisional payments made between the end of one claim and the processing of another assumed income was predictable and stable. In practice, income details used could be two years out of date and were not even being supplied by the claimant on which to base any current payments. The result was awards were not even properly started for that year and may already have been overpaid. Calculations and deductions HMRC told claimants to apply deductions before declaring their income if they had had a child in the previous year, reducing the gross figure of the claimant's income and therefore increased their entitlement to a higher level of award. In reality, this actually caused an overpayment because it transpired that this calculation only worked when it was assumed that the claimant would not be going back to work in the following year. HMRC's lack of experience with the TC client base Because HMRC as a whole, and the staff in general, were used to dealing with higher income earners, they had no understanding of the importance of reliable and secure awards, nor the empathy or experience to deal reasonably with frustrated, confused claimants who had variable circumstances and little previous experience of taxation. Take up of Tax Credit was far higher than expected and staff were working under pressure with fixed deadlines, little training, backlogs, confused claimants and inadequate facilities. Untrained and private sector staff were answering claimant's calls, and callers were not advised of this. Annulled awards These types of overpayment bills are called 'annulled awards' because the Tax Credit Office have said the claimant didn't return the end of year declaration within the time limit. This automatically 'wipes out' their entitlement to all the payments they already received for that tax year. Wrong Capacity this is when a claim is terminated because HMRC believe the couple / single status of the adults on the award was wrong. Rather than the status being changed, the claim is automatically cancelled and all payments already made are ruled as overpaid. No replacement claim is calculated in the ‚Äòright‚Äô capacity unless the claimant invokes the dispute process and is able to successful argue for a Notional Entitlement assessment. The I.T infrastructure The computerised system on which processing, recording and calculating claimants awards was based was flawed. ‚ÄòGlitches‚Äô in the systems mean records are lost or not logged, records were not kept of all communications to the Tax Credit Office, award notices that claimants are supposed to check are not posted or received, and the dual level system means that call operative give out the wrong information regarding claims because they cannot see all case information.Treasury committee report The company responsible EDS were later sued by HMRC Computer Weekly  Fraud and error  To be overpaid is not an accusation or suspicion of fraud or neglect, and there doesn't have to have been an error for an overpayment to have occurred. > \\"An element of overpayment to claimants was an inherent part of the design > of the tax credits system\\" Quote from the Public Accounts Committee's chairman Edward Leigh Public Accounts Committee statement Unhelpfully HMRC combine the figures for fraud and error when publicly releasing the information and do not separate out which is claimant error and which is official error.Error and Fraud Statistics  Dispute process  Some claimants are initially confused when informed of an overpayment, and believe that HMRC are trying to reclaim money the claimant didn't receive. This is because during the course of an award claimants are sent award notices stating the current rate of payments, so when an overpayment is declared claimants don't understand that those award notices are now ‚Äòwrong‚Äô. If the circumstances used to calculate an overpayment are correct, then there is no denying the amount paid was wrong, but responsibility, and therefore who should have to foot the bill, can be contested. Terminology causes confusion here as accepted language would be to Appeal, but because Tax Credits is enshrined in tax law, and in that Appeal has a specific meaning, it is not possible to Appeal against the recovery of an overpayment. (As that would be to insist the circumstances used for the final calculation were wrong) instead, in cases where responsibility for the cause of the overpayment is contested, the correct terminology is to dispute recovery of the overpayment. It is possible to dispute informally, but there is a set structure and route through the process. HMRC's Code of Practice 26 (COP 26) COP 26 sets out the basics of why and how claimants can dispute recovery of an overpayment but does not go into detail. Several agencies offer support and guidance in disputing including the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) CAB Overpayment of tax credits guide and the Tax Credit CasualtiesTCC How to Dispute  Contentious issues  There have been many criticisms of the delivery of tax credits and the handling of overpayment disputes PO reportLITRG articlethe Times TCC article Criticisms have centred on: ‚Ä¢ That the dispute process is not independently adjudicated. ‚Ä¢ The number of HMRC errors claimants are expected to spot. ‚Ä¢ The level of understanding of tax law HMRC assumed claimants would have. ‚Ä¢ HMRC's lack of clear information regarding how to dispute. ‚Ä¢ The poor administration and training of staff. ‚Ä¢ The automatic renewal process that automatically starts a new claim when a claimant provides closing details for the previous year's claim, whether they want a new claim or not. ‚Ä¢ That there is no opt out of the system, if a claimant still qualifies but doesn't want to claim HMRC have to list ‚Äòhousehold break up‚Äô on the claim to invalidate it. ‚Ä¢ That the computer system was rolled out with so many flaws in it. ‚Ä¢ That the increase income disregard from ¬£2,500 to ¬£25,000 was not retroactively backdated and is not the safety net it was supposed to be LITRG to report? ‚Ä¢ HMRC adjusting awards after finalisation, often going back several years, which instantly ‚Äòcreates‚Äô overpayments. ‚Ä¢ The flawed assumptions about how claimants lived that left the system inflexible and unrealistic. ‚Ä¢ The low rate of successful disputes.NAO report ‚Ä¢ Implementation of the Civil Partnerships bill and decisions regarding claimants deemed to be Living Together As Husband And Wife (LTAHAW) have seen them get criticised for dictating lifestyle politics forum posts ‚Ä¢ The annualised calculation system - HMRC traditionally are used to dealing with high income earners and corporations who ‚Äòbalance‚Äô their tax accounts on a yearly basis and have the savings and income to be able to do this.TCC How it Happened  References  1) Section 28 of TCA 2002 2) PO report page 5 3) Official HMRC Tax Credit Statistics section 4) Treasury committee I.T report page 17 5) Computer Weekly 6) Public Accounts Committee statement 7) Error and Fraud Statistics 8) COP 26 9) CAB Overpayment of tax credits guide 10) TCC How to Dispute 11) PO Report 12) LITRG article 13) The Times TCC article 14) LITRG to report? 15) NAO report section 2, page R10, table 11 and 12 16) Forum posts 17) TCC How it Happened  External links  * Tax Credit Casualties * The Parliamentary Ombudsman * Adjudicator's Office * Low Income Tax Reform Group Category:Taxation in the United Kingdom Category:Tax credits ","title":"Tax credit overpayment"},{"id":"20299110","text":"1891 and authorized by the Funding Act of 1870 The Funding Act of 1870 (41st Congress, Sess. 2, ch. 256, , enacted July 14, 1870) was an Act of Congress to re-fund the national debt.

It contains four species, two endemic to Australia. Overview They are evergreen trees or shrubs from southern hemisphere of gondwanan origin, native to the temperate rainforests. The trees will reach approximately 100 feet (30 m) tall. They have dark to medium green lanceolate lauroid leaves with serrated edges. The leaves have a strong sarsaparilla odor when crushed. The lumber is used in cabinetry and a tonic is made from the bark of some species, Doryphora aromatica and Doryphora sassafras, which also have insect-repelling properties. The flowers are white star-shaped. The blooms cover the tree at canopy level in the rainforest. They are cloud forest plants and need partial shade to full sun with a moist well-drained soil mix. The plants must kept moist at all times. The winter temperature must not fall below 50 ¬∞F (10 ¬∞C). Doryphora are propagated by birds that eat the berries. The seed are very small and germinate in 80‚Äì100 days at 70 ¬∞F (21 ¬∞C). This genus originated in the Antarctic flora, and shares plant species with South America, New Caledonia, Tasmania and Australia, in habitats of cloud forest and temperate rainforest. It was in the Cretaceous that angiosperm flora colonized New Zealand and New Caledonia, from South America, along the Antarctic margin of Gondwana, with species as Nothofagus and Proteaceae. They are yet umbr√≥fila plants in forest or rainforest in place like New Caledonia. The genus includes plants with vicariant species that fulfil the same ecological role in other areas. The role of Nothofagus and Podocarpaceae was occupied by the Taxus and various oaks in other places. Species *Doryphora aromatica (Bailey) L.S.Sm. (northeast Queensland) *Doryphora sassafras Endl.

At that time its railway network, which comprised 800 kilometres of track, went over to the Prussian state.  Construction phases and routes   The Kreuzbahn  The concept of the Kreuzbahn arose from the desire of Ernest Augustus, King of Hanover, to avoid having a central railway station in Hanover. The routes therefore ran into the district of Lehrte in the form of a cross (hence Kreuzbahn = cross railway) and, as a result, Lehrte developed into an important railway hub. The government of the Kingdom of Hanover had initially taken over the construction of state railways, because no private sponsors could be found for the first railway lines that were planned. These were the routes: * Hanover via Lehrte to Peine on the border with the Duchy of Brunswick * Lehrte to Celle * Lehrte to Hildesheim The first line, a 16 kilometre stretch from Hanover via Misburg to Lehrte, was opened on 22 October 1843. Its extension towards Brunswick followed on 1 December 1843 as far as the state border at Peine; there on 19 May 1844 it was joined to the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway that owned almost a third of the now 60 kilometre long connexion between the two residenz cities. On 15 October 1845 the Lehrte‚ÄìCelle line followed and on 12 June 1846 the Lehrte‚ÄìHildesheim line was finally completed. From the Kreuzbahn the following additional lines were built under the direction of the Royal Hanoverian Railway which was founded on 13 March 1843: The Celle‚ÄìHarburg line via Uelzen and L√ºneburg was opened on 1 May 1847 and on 15 October 1847 the Hannover‚ÄìMinden line followed with its connexion to the main line operated by the Cologne‚ÄìMinden Railway Company.  Bremen Railway  Timetable for the railway service from Bremen to Hanover from 1854 Against the wishes of Prussia the line to Bremen, which was jointly funded with the state of Bremen, was not constructed directly from Minden, but from Hanoverian Wunstorf. On 12 December 1847 the Wunstorf‚ÄìBremen section was opened. As a result of the political events of 1848/49 (March revolutions), further expansion of the railway network in the Kingdom of Hanover was delayed.  Hanoverian Southern Railway  * 1 May 1853: Hannover‚ÄìAlfeld * 15 September 1853: Nordstemmen‚ÄìHildesheim link * 31 July 1854: Alfeld‚ÄìKreiensen‚ÄìG√∂ttingen extension * 8 May 1856: G√∂ttingen‚ÄìHanoverian M√ºnden (including the Dransfelder Rampe) * 23 September 1856: Hanoverian M√ºnden‚ÄìKassel  Hanoverian Western Railway  The project, jointly agreed with Prussia, for a railway from L√∂hne to the Cologne-Minden Railway Company network via Osnabr√ºck to Emden did not come to fruition until there had been protracted discussions about the course of the line and its connexion to the Dutch railway network. In the end they agreed upon the present-day route from von L√∂hne via Osnabr√ºck to Prussian Rheine, that at the same time provided a junction at M√ºnster to the Royal Westphalian Railway Company (K√∂niglich-Westf√§lische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) and from there a link via Salzbergen to Leer and Emden. The link to the Dutch railway network was achieved from Hanoverian Salzbergen through Bentheim to Oldenzaal. On 24 November 1854 the first section, Emden‚ÄìPapenburg, was completed. * 21. November 1855: L√∂hne‚ÄìOsnabr√ºck opened * 19./20. Juni 1856: Entire route via Rheine to Emden completed * 18. November 1865: Salzbergen‚ÄìOldenzaal  Bremen‚ÄìBremerhaven railway  On 23 January 1862 the extension of the Bremen line to Geestem√ºnde/Weserm√ºnde (today Bremerhaven) was effected, again in conjunction with the city of Bremen.  Elbe train ferry  On 15 March 1864 after lengthy negotiations the line along the river Elbe from L√ºneburg to Hohnstorf was finally built and, at the same time the Lauenburg-Hohnstorf Elbe Ferry Company was formed and they established a ferry to connect with the Berlin-Hamburg Railway Company's Lauenburg‚ÄìB√ºchen line on the other side of the Elbe.  Harz  The Vienenburg‚ÄìGoslar railway was also owned by the Hanoverian State Railways, although it was operated by the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway. The G√∂ttingen‚ÄìArenshausen and Northeim‚ÄìEllrich lines were not completed until after the transfer of the Hanoverian State Railways to Prussia after the War of 1866.  Transfer of the state railway to Prussia  On 15 December 1866 the Royal Hanoverian State Railways was merged into the Prussian state railways and renamed as the Prussian railway division of Hanover.

Medipart, Inc., 976 F.2d 700 (Fed. Cir. 1992), is a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in which the court appeared to overrule or drastically limit many years of U.S. Supreme Court precedent affirming the patent exhaustion doctrine, for example in Bauer & Cie. v. O'Donnell.. Drawing of patented device in Mallinckrodt case Factual background According to the opinions in the case, the plaintiff Mallinckrodt owned a patent on a device for dispensing a radioactive mist used in taking diagnostic lung X-rays, and for trapping the mist after use. Mallinckrodt sold the device to hospitals for about $40 or $50. Hospital personnel would load the device with a suitable radioactive fluid to perform a diagnostic procedure on a patient, use the device, and then discard it. Mallinckrodt labeled the devices it sold with the notice \\"Single use only.\\" Because the device itself cost approximately $10 to make but was sold for four or five times that, most of the purchase price that hospitals paid Mallinckrodt apparently represented the value of the patent (or the patented technology). This fact apparently led the defendant Medipart to go into the recycling business, in which Mallinckrodt itself had no direct interest (it chose to sell only new devices). For a $20 recycling fee, Medipart would clean one of the devices for a hospital, replace some parts, subject the device to gamma radiation to kill germs, and return it to the hospital for reuse. The district court and court of appeals opinions do not support the claim that a health or safety problem existed. However, Mallinckrodt asserted to the court that \\"potential adverse consequences, such as infectious disease transmission\\" provided the reason for its imposing the restriction against reuse. Litigation and rulings Since Medipart and hospitals dealing with it were defying Mallinckrodt's \\"Single use only\\" label and adversely affecting its business, Mallinckrodt sued the recycler for patent infringement. Medipart then moved to dismiss the patent infringement claim because of the exhaustion doctrine; the district court agreed and granted summary judgment. Mallinckrodt appealed and the Federal Circuit reversed. It held that, despite the breadth of the language of the Supreme Court's decisions on exhaustion, the apparently absolute rule against post-sale restrictions on patentees' customers should apply only to price-fixes and tie-ins. In cases not involving price-fixes or tie-ins, such as this one, patentees were free to limit their customer's use of products as long as the restrictions did not so greatly hinder competition as to amount to an antitrust violation. The reasoning of the Mallinckrodt court proceeds along the following lines: * Most or many of the Supreme Court's line of exhaustion doctrine cases involved price-fixing or tie-ins. * Therefore, they could have been decided on the legal theory that price-fixes and tie-ins are illegal per se. * Any sweeping language by the Supreme Court about property rights, and about post-sale restrictions on customers' use of patented products not being patent infringement, is mere obiter dictum that may properly be disregarded in cases not involving price-fixes or tie-ins. The ruling in Mallinckrodt had two principal prongs, both of which figured in subsequent Federal Circuit decisions. First, the main holding was that patent owners could sell patented goods with a restrictive notice and thereby restrict the disposition of the goods by the purchasers, with the sole exception of price-fixing and tie-in restrictions.. Thus, the Mallinckrodt court had said that, \\"[u]nless the condition violates some other law or policy (in the patent field, notably the misuse or antitrust law),\\" patentees enjoyed freedom of contract to impose post-sale restrictions on customers under a rule of reason. \\"The appropriate criterion\\" for determining the limits of this freedom to impose restrictions, according to the Federal Circuit, \\"is whether [the patentee's or licensor's] restriction is reasonably within the patent grant, or whether the patentee has ventured beyond the patent grant and into behavior having an anticompetitive effect not justifiable under the rule of reason.\\"Mallinckrodt, 976 F.2d at 708. The second prong concerned patent misuse. According to the court, the legal tests for post-sale restrictions and for misuse were alike, outside the tie-in and price fixing area: \\"To sustain a misuse defense involving a licensing arrangement not held to have been per se anticompetitive by the Supreme Court, a factual determination must reveal that the overall effect of the license tends to restrain competition unlawfully in an appropriately defined relevant market.\\"Mallinckrodt, 976 F.2d at 706 (quoting Windsurfing Int'l, Inc. v. AMF, Inc., 782 F.2d 995, 1001-02 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). Other Federal Circuit decisions have followed the ruling of the Mallinckrodt misuse prong.See, e.g., U.S. Philips Corp. v. International Trade Com'n, 424 F.3d 1179, 1185 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (\\"If the particular licensing arrangement in question is not one of those specific practices that has been held to constitute per se misuse, it will be analyzed under the rule of reason. We have held that under the rule of reason, a practice is impermissible only if its effect is to restrain competition in a relevant market.\\") (citations omitted); Impact Until the Federal Circuit's Mallinckrodt decision, an unbroken line of Supreme Court and lower court precedents held that the patentee's patent right over a product that the patentee sold (or that a licensee authorised to make a sale sold) ended at the point of sale.See opinion of US Supreme Court in (\\"The longstanding doctrine of patent exhaustion provides that the initial authorized sale of a patented item terminates all patent rights to that item.\\"). The Court's opinion summarizes 19th and 20th Century case law. Accordingly, a customer did not commit patent infringement by disobeying a notice, contract, or other \\"remote control\\" limitation that the patentee sought to impose on the use of goods that it had sold to the customer. The Supreme Court's rationale in exhaustion doctrine cases was that the purchasers acquired an unlimited property right in the patented products, and that it was inconsistent with that property right for the patentee to control how the purchasers used or disposed of the products once they had become the property of the purchasers. The legal reasoning in all of these decisions begins with that principle, and the rest of the analysis consists of applying it to the particular facts. Until the 2008 Supreme Court decision in the Quanta case, however, the Federal Circuit's Mallinckrodt decision superseded the earlier line of exhaustion cases. It has been observed that under the doctrine of the Mallinckrodt case, a patentee may sell its patented product with a legally effective notice prohibiting purchasers from engaging in any of the following conduct:See . * Prohibiting repair of patented products and parts replacement (for example, the seller labels the device: \\"Licensed for use only until element B wears out\\") * Prohibiting modification or enhancement of patented devices (for example, the manufacturer places a notice on the machine stating \\"Machine licensed for use only as is, without modification\\") * Charging different prices in different niche markets and preventing arbitrage from one market to another (for example, selling semiconductor chips labeled \\"For use only in microwave oven market\\") * Permitting resale only in specified channel of distribution The Federal Circuit's Mallinckrodt doctrine has not avoided criticism as allegedly stating legal rules that contradict Supreme Court decisions. Thus in 2007, the United States Solicitor General filed an amicus curiae brief in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.,128 S. Ct. 2109 (2008). stating, as to the first prong, \\"The test adopted by the Federal Circuit in Mallinckrodt thus reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the role and scope of the patent- exhaustion doctrine. ... The court of appeals' approach cannot be reconciled with those [Supreme Court] precedents,\\"Brief for United States as amicus curiae in Quanta, at 23; see also id. at 6 (\\"In recent years, the first-sale doctrine has evolved in the Federal Circuit in a manner that is at odds with this Court's precedents.\\"); id. at 22 (\\"The Federal Circuit misreads Univis as standing only for the proposition that restrictions that have been found to be unlawful restraints on trade in the patent context, such as \\"price-fixing or tying\\" arrangements, cannot be enforced in a patent-infringement suit.\\"). and more generally that the Federal Circuit's Quanta opinion based on Mallinckrodt \\"rests on the same erroneous understanding of patent exhaustion that infuses the Federal Circuit's approach to this area of the law.\\"Id. at 30. The effect of Mallinckrodt may have been restricted by the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., which broadly reaffirmed the exhaustion doctrine without mentioning Mallinckrodt. It is too early to state, however, what the impact of Quanta on the Mallinckrodt doctrine will be. Continued viability questioned In April 2015, the Federal Circuit sua sponte called for briefing and amicus curiae participation in an en banc consideration of whether Mallinckrodt should be overruled in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in the Quanta case. The court ordered: > In light of Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 553 U.S. 617 > (2008), should this court overrule Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc., 976 > F.2d 700 (Fed. Cir. 1992), to the extent it ruled that a sale of a patented > article, when the sale is made under a restriction that is otherwise lawful > and within the scope of the patent grant, does not give rise to patent > exhaustion? The oral argument took place on Oct. 2, 2015. The Federal Circuit then re-affirmed Mallinckrodt but on December 2, 2016, the Supreme Court granted certiorari.Impression Prods. v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc., 2016 U.S. LEXIS 7275. The case was argued in 2017 and was decided in June 2017; the Supreme Court emphatically rejected enforcement of post-sale patent rights, thereby disapproving the decision in Mallinckrodt..

This Hindu Personal Law or modern Hindu law is an extension of the Anglo-Hindu Law developed during the British colonial period in India, which is in turn related to the less well-defined tradition of Classical Hindu Law. The time frame of this period of Hindu law begins with the formal independence of India from Great Britain on August 14, 1947, and extends up until the present. While modern Hindu law is heralded for its inherent respect for religious doctrines, many still complain that discrimination (especially with the historical tradition of the caste system) still pervades the legal system. Though efforts to modernize and increase the legal rights of the marginalized have been made (most notably with the passage of the Hindu Code Bills and the establishment of notable legal precedents), the modern legal situation is, like all legal systems across the world, far from perfect.  History and Context  With the formal independence of India from Great Britain on August 15, 1947, India acquired a new constitution as well as a complex legal system. While a Western influence is apparent in this system, it is not an exact replication. The Indian legal system has characteristics of common law, but is codified and thus is actually more similar to civil law in nature. The modern Hindu legal system is applied to strictly personal law, including issues of marriage, inheritance and adoption, whereas India's secular legal system is applied to issues of criminal law and civil law. India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru and the then law minister Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar worked to unify the newly independent India by proposing the reformation and codification of Hindu personal law. Nehru's efforts led to contentious debates over the so-called Hindu Code Bill, which he offered in the Indian parliament, as a way to fix still unclear elements of the Anglo-Hindu law. The Hindu Code Bill was initially and continues to be very controversial within and outside of the Hindu community. Criticism of the document is based on the belief that the laws in the Hindu Code bill should apply to all citizens regardless of religious affiliation.Bannigan, John (1952, December 3). The Hindu Code Bill. Far Eastern Survey: American Institute of Pacific Relations, XX1, Retrieved October 22, 2008, Though a small minority suggested some kind of return to classical Hindu law, the real debate was over how to appropriate the Anglo- Hindu law. Nehru completed codification and partial reform, but overall the legal system only slightly changed. In the end, a series of four major pieces of personal law legislation were passed in 1955-56 and these laws form the first point of reference for modern Hindu law: Hindu Marriage Act (1955), Hindu Succession Act (1956), Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act (1956), and Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act (1956). Though these legislative moves purported to resolve still unclear parts of the Anglo-Hindu law, the case law and interpretive tradition of British judges and Indian judges in the British employ remained and remains crucial to the application of modern Hindu law.  Application of Modern Hindu Law  As stated by Article 44 of the Indian Constitution, India is a secular state that strives towards legal uniformity. Many argue that the commitment of the Indian government towards this gradual uniformity of the legal system threatens the minority religious groups that utilize the plurality of the law to maintain traditions and implement their religious laws. While modern Indian Law claims to make strides towards secularism, it is undeniable that its foundations rise from the Hindu legal tradition and continues to maintain religious legal acceptance by recognizing the personal and family laws of the Islamic, Christian, Jewish, and Hindu religions. Before discussing the modern application and sources of Hindu law it is important to outline whom these laws govern. In the case of Hindu personal and family laws, as outlined by the Acts of Parliament discussed below, those that are followers the Hindu religion, as well as those who are not Christian, Jewish or Muslim, are held accountable to these laws.Nagpal, Ramesh C. Modern Hindu Law. Allahabad: Manav Law House, 1983. Therefore, it is assumed that all Indians who are not Muslim, Jewish or Christian are Hindu, disregarding personal religious laws of followers of Buddhist, Jain, Sikh and other religions, creating controversy within these communities. The Indian legal system does recognize Muslim, Jewish and Christian family courts as well as secular family courts.  Sources of Modern Hindu Law  Sources of Classical Hindu law arose from the religious texts of the Dharma≈õƒÅstra, as well as sadachar or customs, and commentaries or digests that translated and interpreted the laws. Since British colonialism, India has codified several aspects of the Hindu tradition into the Indian legal system as well as adopted common and civil legal procedures.  Legislation  Legislation, as created and implemented by the Indian government, is the strongest source of law in all Indian courts. In the case of two conflicting sources, legislation holds the highest jurisdiction. While it is not a traditional source of law for the Hindu legal system, it is the latest and most legitimate form. During colonialism, the British codified several aspects of the Hindu legal tradition into the Indian legal system, with the assumption that all Indians were Hindus. Thus upon gaining independence, many of the same laws that governed the country during colonialism were maintained as such, making the Indian Constitution and legal system heavily laden with Hindu legal traditions at its foundation.Menski, Werner. Comparative Law in a Global Context : The Legal Systems of Asia and Africa. New York: Cambridge UP, 2006.  Case Law  India is based on the British common legal system, thus the courts rely heavily on stare decisis, or precedent, when deciding cases. Any case decision made by a higher court is a source of law to all of the lower courts, in the prospect that the laws will be applied in a similar manner. The Hindu family courts are expected to follow laws handed down from previous cases. Modern Hindu law relies on the interpretation of judges and their ability to decipher mitigating factors within each legal situation. This is reflective of the ancient Hindu legal tradition of working out problems on a case specific basis in finding justice in each specific instance.  Notable Legal Precedents and Legislation As is the case with many global legal systems that rely on precedents as a source of law, certain cases stand out that have shaped the Indian legal system into what it is today. Not only do they provide the foundation for future legal cases but they also make a statement about the state of the country and what direction it wants to lead. One such case came about during the efforts of modernization reforms in India. Known as the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (1971), the law allowed Indian women to legally obtain abortions. Thus this law made not only a religious statement, as India was trying to become more secular, but also made a statement of equality as it expanded the rights women had. Another Act that most came to be was Early in December 2008, the marriage between a Hindu and a Christian was deemed invalid under the Hindu Marriage Act (1955) as the Act provides for only Hindu couples to enter into a wedlock, the Supreme Court has ruled.http://in.news.yahoo.com/48/20081206/804/tnl-hindu-christian-wedlock- invalid-unde.html Allegedly, Raj had misinformed his wife about his social status and she filed for divorce. He claimed that the Hindu Marriage Act does not preclude a Hindu from marrying a person of another faith. Dismissing the Christian husband‚Äôs appeal, the apex court upheld the High Courts‚Äôs view that the marriage not valid under the Hindu Marriage Act, specifically pointing to the fact that Section 5 of the Act makes it clear that a marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus if the conditions in the said Section were fulfilled.  Hindu Code Bills  Following independence, the postcolonial government led by Jawaharlal Nehru completed the codification and reform of Hindu personal law, a process that had been begun by the British. According to the British policy of noninterference, reform of personal law should have arisen from a demand from the Hindu community. This was not the case, as there was significant opposition from various Hindu politicians, organizations, and devotees who saw themselves unjustly singled out as the sole religious community whose laws were to be reformed.Rina Williams. Postcolonial Politics and Personal Laws. Oxford University Press: New Delhi. 2006. Pg. 18 However, the administration saw such codification as necessary in order to unify the Hindu community, which ideally would be a first step towards unifying the nation.Rina Williams. Postcolonial Politics and Personal Laws. Oxford University Press: New Delhi. 2006. Pg. 107 They succeeded in passing four Hindu Code Bills, including Hindu Marriage Act (1955), Hindu Succession Act (1956), Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act (1956), and Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act (1956).Rina Williams. Postcolonial Politics and Personal Laws. Oxford University Press: New Delhi. 2006. Pg. 106 Nehru and his supporters insisted that the Hindu community, which comprised 80% of the Indian population, first needed to be united before any actions were taken to unify the rest of India. Therefore, the codification of Hindu personal law became a symbolic beginning on the road to establishing the Indian national identity. Nehru also felt that because he was Hindu, it was his prerogative to codify specifically Hindu law, as opposed to Muslim or Jewish law.Rina Williams. Postcolonial Politics and Personal Laws. Oxford University Press: New Delhi. 2006. Pg. 119 Those in Parliament who supported the Bills also saw them as a vital move towards the modernization of Hindu society, as they would clearly delineate secular laws from religious law. Many also heralded the Bill‚Äôs opportunity to implement greater rights for women, establishing that such rights were necessary for India‚Äôs development.Rina Williams. Postcolonial Politics and Personal Laws. Oxford University Press: New Delhi. 2006. Pg. 108 The Hindu Code Bills are still controversial among some communities, including women's, nationalist, and religious groups. At the time of their creation, many portrayed them as a serious deviation from Hindu legal precedent. However, now many, including Nivedita Menon, argue that it is \\"misleading...to claim that Hindu personal law was reformed [in the 1950s]. It was merely codified, and even that was in the face of stiff resistance from Congress leaders.\\" Rina Williams. Postcolonial Politics and Personal Laws. Oxford University Press: New Delhi. 2006. Pg. 114  Administration and Practice  There are no religious courts in India, as it is a secular nation. Rather religious personal laws are adjudicated by the state on a case by case basis. Courts The court system of India is essentially divided into three tiers, the Supreme Court of India at the apex of the hierarchy for the entire country, twenty-one High Courts at the top of the hierarchy in each State, and subsequent district courts that govern family, criminal and civil laws within the states. The High Courts have jurisdiction over a state, a union territory or a group of states and union territories. District courts are the courts of first resort. It is within the district courts that Hindu law and other religious laws are administered. State judges apply Hindu law on a case by case basis. Judges The judges that preside over the district courts in India are state bureaucrats, not religious priests or scholars. Thus it is possible for a Hindu judge to preside over a divorce case between a Muslim couple or for a Christian judge to preside over a case involving a Hindu family. With no formal education on the religious laws of the state, judges may not be well versed in the laws they are to adjudicate. They rely heavily on case precedent and scholarly works to guide them through the cases.http://www.upiasia.com/Human_Rights/2008/10/13/indian_judges_must_clean_up_their_courts/2363/  Lawyers Lawyers in India are trained in general law schools and receive no formal and specific training on Hindu law, Muslim law, or any other personal religious laws. All lawyers are however required to take courses regarding personal law. These larger courses touch on the variety of personal laws that exist in India, including Hindu Law.

It is a tall tree with green foliage and contrasting white flowers which occur in Autumn and Winter. Taxonomy Doryphora sassafras was first described by Austrian naturalist Stephan Endlicher in 1837. Its generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek dory- \\"spear\\" and pherein \\"to carry\\", and refers to the anthers in the flower, while its specific epithet is taken from its similar odour to the North American Laurel (Sassafras albidum). It is a member of the small family Atherospermataceae along with several other Australian rainforest trees including southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum). Common names include Canary Sassafras, Yellow Sassafras, Golden Sassafras, Golden Deal or simply Sassafras. Description Doryphora sassafras can grow to a height of 25‚Äì35 m (80‚Äì110 ft).Floyd, Alexander G. 1990: Australian Rainforests in New South Wales, Volume 1. Surrey Beatty & Sons Pty Ltd, Chipping Norton, NSW. It is a straight-trunked tree generally with a small crown, its grey-brown trunk reaching a diameter of 1.2 m (4 ft). Oppositely arranged on the stem, the green leaves are elliptic to lanceolate or ovate, usually 7‚Äì10 cm (3‚Äì4 in) long, 2‚Äì4 cm wide, margins are shallowly to deeply toothed, glabrous and glossy, with a pleasant 'sassafras' scent when crushed. They have a prominent midrib and veins on the paler underside. The small white flowers occur in groups of three on short axillary stalks from May to July, and are followed by dark brown hairy fruit which are ripe from February to August. The flowering display can be showy with flowers massed on branches. contrasting against the darker foliage.

Completed just five years before his death, this picture, like many of his works, forms a meditation both on his own mortality and on the transience of life. The painting is set on a sea shore and shows in the foreground an aged man with his back turned to the viewer, walking towards two adults and two children on a hilltop overlooking a harbour.Vaughan, 297 The figures are echoed by five ships shown in the harbour, each at a different distance from the shore, an allegorical reference to the different stages of human life, to the end of a journey, to the closeness of death. The figures have been identified as Friedrich and his family. The aged man is the artist himself, the small boy is his young son Gustav Adolf, the young girl is his daughter Agnes Adelheid, the older girl is his daughter Emma, and the man in the top hat is his nephew Johann Heinrich.B√∂rsch-Supan (1973), p. 629-30 Although many of Friedrich's paintings were set in imagined landscapes, The Stages of Life is recognisably located at Utkiek, near Friedrich's birthplace of Greifswald in today's northeastern Germany. Description The painting depicts a Baltic Sea port in the dusk. On the sea three sailing ships returning home can be seen; the large ship in the middle has already begun to draw in its sails. Two smaller sailboats have almost reached land. The one on the right heads directly for the group of five people on the bank, who by their clothes are recognizable as townspeople. In their midst sits a boy who holds up a Swedish pennant, while the girl beside him reaches for it. To their right sits a woman who leans toward both children with her right hand raised. These five figures correspond to the five ships visible in the harbour beyond. The three groupings of figures (one aged man, two adults, and two children) echo the positioning of the ships at various distances from the shore as allegorical of the stages of life, and closeness to death. The central ship is thought to represent the mother, while further inshore, two small boats‚Äîreferences to the two children‚Äîhave only just begun their voyage and still remain in shallow, clear water. To the horizon, the farthest ship disappears into the setting horizon, symbolizing the aged man's voyage from this life into the unknown.100 Meisterwerke. \\"Die Lebensstufen von Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840).\\" In: TV H√∂ren und Sehen, 29 2011, p. 130 Alternatively, other critics have interpreted the two ships in the distance as the mother and father sailing off to live their lives and gain experience and wisdom as parents, and the large ship closest to the shore as the old man - one who has lived a full life, built up many experiences and is finally pulling into the harbor at the end of life.Charles Rosen: Caspar David Friedrich and the Language of Landscape. The group forms a semicircle: the children are on its farthest point; to their left and right are a younger man and the young woman. On the extreme left an older man stands looking straight ahead, outside the circle. The women and children are dressed for summer, while the old man wears a coat and a fur hat. The bow of the big ship in the middle is exactly aligned with the two children. Swedish pennant Detail of center section, showing children with the Swedish flag. Friedrich's home town of Greifswald belonged to the Duchy of Pomerania until 1630, when the area passed to Sweden as Swedish Pomerania. In 1815 it became part of Prussian Province of Pomerania. The painting shows Friedrich's younger daughter Agnes Adelheid and his son Gustav Adolf holding a Swedish pennant 20 years after the cession of Greifswald to Prussia.For this reason, earlier art historians believed the painting to have dated from at least before 1815 The view encompasses the peninsula in front of the Baltic Sea, beyond which lies Sweden. Friedrich christened his son Gustav Adolf, after the Swedish king Gustav Adolf IV. The Swedish writer Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom wrote of the painter, Title In keeping with the Romantic ideals of the time, Friedrich intended his paintings to function purely in visual terms, and thus he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that the relatively literal title The Stages of Life was not given by the artist himself, but that the work was instead renamed during a revival of interest in the artist in the late 19th or early 20th century.\\"Caspar David Friedrich inventing Romanticism\\". designboom.com.

Since 2005, many international organizations have expressed concern over the rise in acts of piracy. Piracy impeded the delivery of shipments and increased shipping expenses, costing an estimated $6.6 to $6.9 billion a year in global trade according to Oceans Beyond Piracy (OBP). According to the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), a veritable industry of profiteers also arose around the piracy. Insurance companies significantly increased their profits from the pirate attacks as insurance companies hiked premium rates in response. Combined Task Force 150, a multinational coalition task force, took on the role of fighting the piracy by establishing a Maritime Security Patrol Area (MSPA) within the Gulf of Aden and Socotra Passage. According to the International Maritime Bureau, pirate attacks had by October 2012 dropped to a six-year low, with only one ship attacked in the third quarter compared to thirty-six during the same period in 2011. By December 2013, the US Office of Naval Intelligence reported that only 9 vessels had been attacked during the year by pirates, with zero successful hijackings. Control Risks attributed this 90% decline in pirate activity from the corresponding period in 2012 to the adoption of better management practices by vessel owners and crews, armed private security on board ships, a significant naval presence, and the development of onshore security forces.

The album has been recompiled and expanded three additional times, with various tracks from these sessions added and deleted. The tracks from the Modern Jazz Quartet plus Lou Donaldson consisted of John Lewis on piano, Percy Heath on bass, Kenny Clarke on drums, Milt Jackson on vibraphone, and Lou Donaldson on alto saxophone. The tracks with the Thelonious Monk Quintet were Thelonious Monk on piano, John Simmons on bass, Shadow Wilson on drums, and Milt Jackson on vibraphone‚Äîwith Kenny \\"Pancho\\" Hagood singing on the tracks \\"All the Things You Are\\" and \\"I Should Care\\".

Reception The Penguin Guide to Jazz described the tracks with Monk as \\"classics, rising to their greatest height with the riveting version of \\"I Mean You\\".\\" The AllMusic reviewer wrote that \\"Jackson's inventive playing throughout both dates makes this an important CD in his considerable discography, so it should be a part of any bop fan's collection.\\" Track listings Milt Jackson, Wizard of the Vibes (Blue Note LP 5011, 10\\", 1952) Side 1: #\\"Tahiti\\" #\\"Lillie\\" #\\"Criss-Cross\\" #\\"Willow Weep for Me\\" Side 2: #\\"What's New?\\" #\\"Bags' Groove\\" #\\"On the Scene\\" #\\"Eronel\\" Tracks A3, A4, B4 recorded July 23, 1951.

This was the first of his two consecutive titles. Eddie MacDonald finished second in the championship behind Truex by 34 points. Brett Moffitt, driving the No. 44 car for Andy Santerre, finished third in the championship. The 2009 NASCAR Camping World East Series was the 23rd season of the Camping World East Series, a touring series sanctioned by NASCAR. Matt Kobyluck entered the season as the defending drivers' champion. Ryan Truex won the championship, 34 points in front of Eddie MacDonald. This was the last season for the East Series with the Camping World title sponsorship. Because Camping World decided to be the title sponsor for the NASCAR Truck Series starting in 2009, they did not renew their title sponsorship of NASCAR's East and West Series after their contract for that ended at the end of the 2009 season. (So, they sponsored all three series for that year only.) K&N; Filters became the new title sponsor for the East and West Series starting in 2010. Schedule The schedule was announced on December 24, 2008 with eleven races at ten different tracks. The series lost three tracks from last year's schedule (Stafford Motor Speedway, Music City Motorplex and Mansfield Motorsports Park) but gains one new track for this season (Tri-County Motor Speedway). The Tennessee State Fairgrounds was initially on the schedule but changes in management of the track at the track (new management decided to eliminate NASCAR sanction) resulted in the loss of the event. For the fourth year in a row, the regular season began at Greenville-Pickens Speedway on April 11. The series made its first appearance at Tri-County Motor Speedway two weeks later on April 25 before heading to Iowa for the series' third appearance at Iowa Speedway. The Iowa race was a combination East/West race where drivers from both series will compete against each other. Drivers are awarded points based on their finishing position against drivers in their series. (i.e. Highest finishing driver in the East gets first place points and the highest finishing driver in the West gets first place points) Traditional stops at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Thompson International Speedway, Adirondack International Speedway, and Lime Rock Park fill up the bulk of the summer schedule before the regular season finale at Dover International Speedway on September 25. On March 16, 2009, NASCAR announced that Speed Channel would broadcast each race as part of a one-hour special that would air on Thursdays at 3 p.m. ET. The 2009 season Toyota All-Star Showdown was held on January 30, 2010, and was televised on Speed Channel. {  style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" - !Date !Race !Distance !Venue !TV Air Date1 -  April 11  NASCAR Home Tracks 150 Presented by Kevin Whitaker Chevrolet  150 Laps  Greenville-Pickens Speedway  April 16 -  April 25  NASCAR Camping World Series East-Tri-County 150  150 Laps  Tri-County Motor Speedway  May 7 -  May 17  Long John Silver's 200  200 Laps  Iowa Speedway  May 28 -  May 30  South Boston 150  150 Laps  South Boston Speedway  June 4 -  June 6  Tioga Downs Casino 125  125 Miles  Watkins Glen International  June 11 -  June 26  Heluva Good!

Performances like Saturday night at historic Greenville Pickens Speedway certainly don‚Äôt hurt his cause, as Ickler led nearly every lap from start to finish in winning the season-opening NASCAR Home Tracks 150 presented by Kevin Whitaker Chevrolet at Greenville-Pickens Speedway on April 11. Ickler recorded his fourth career NASCAR Camping World Series East victory and seventh NASCAR Camping World Series victory overall. Veteran Jody Lavender scored a career-best second- place finish, while Eddie MacDonald finished third. Josh Richards and Brett Moffitt, both making their first career NASCAR starts, rounded out the top five. Ickler qualified second behind pole position winner Moffitt. A multi-car accident in Turn 1 on the start of the race caused a lengthy red flag before the end of the first lap. NASCAR decided to reset the lineup of the field with the exception of those cars involved in the accident and do a complete restart of the event. Several cars came into the pits to repair damage and would have to start at the rear of the field since they were considered to have pitted before the initial green flag. On the second attempt at the start, Ickler got the jump on Moffitt and quickly began to pull away from the field. MacDonald, restarting on the outside of the front row, briefly took the lead by a nose on two restarts. Each time however, Ickler erased the lead and pulled out to a commanding lead. Ickler led four times for 146 laps. In addition, the victory gave Ickler a secured spot in the postseason NASCAR Toyota All-Star Showdown - a spot reserved for winners of the NASCAR Camping World Series events in 2009. =Results= {  style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" - !colspan=9Official Results - !Finish !Start !Car # !Driver !Hometown !Car !Laps !Reason Out - 1 2 15 Brian Ickler San Diego, Calif.

The 17-year-old Grass Valley, Calif., driver passed Austin Dillon on a back-and-forth battle following a green-white-checkered finish to Saturday night‚Äôs Tri-County 150 to earn his first career NASCAR Camping World Series East victory. DiBenedetto, a Joe Gibbs Racing development driver, and Dillon, a Richard Childress Racing development driver, swapped the lead six times over the second half of the race. The event was stretched to 165 laps due to a pair of late cautions. DiBenedetto led four times for 75 laps, while Dillon led three times for 15 laps. On the final restart, Dillon got the jump from the second spot to take the lead. DiBenedetto, however, was able to nose underneath as they came to the white flag and took the lead going into Turn 1 of the final lap. Rookie Alan Tardiff earned his first Coors Light Pole Award earlier in the day and brought home his best finish with a third-place run. Jody Lavender took over the points lead with a fourth-place finish, while Patrick Long rounded out the top five. =Results= {  style=\\"font-size: 90%;\\" - !colspan=9Official Results - !Finish !Start !Car # !Driver !Team !Laps !Points/Bonus Points !Reason Out - 1 3 18 Matt DiBenedetto Toyota 165 190/10  - 2 4 3 Austin Dillon Chevrolet 165 175/5  - 3 1 38 Alan Tardiff * Chevrolet 165 170/5  - 4 10 88 Jody Lavender Chevrolet 165 160  - 5 9 03 Patrick Long Chevrolet 165 155  - 6 2 9 Trevor Bayne Chevrolet 165 150  - 7 7 4 Dakoda Armstrong * Chevrolet 165 146  - 8 16 7 Ryan Duff Chevrolet 165 142  - 9 15 39 Dustin Delaney Chevrolet 165 138  - 10 6 40 Matt Kobyluck Chevrolet 165 139/5  - 11 22 17 Jason Patison Chevrolet 165 130  - 12 8 71 Eddie MacDonald Chevrolet 165 127  - 13 19 52 Kyle Fowler Chevrolet 165 124  - 14 21 37 Alex Kennedy Chevrolet 165 121  - 15 13 35 Steve Park Chevrolet 165 118  - 16 20 00 Ryan Truex * Toyota 165 115  - 17 14 29 Ryan Gifford Chevrolet 165 112  - 18 11 63 John Salemi Chevrolet 165 109  - 19 24 12 Antonio P√©rez Dodge 164 106  - 20 23 61 Dominick Casola * Chevrolet 164 103  - 21 12 72 Jason Cochran * Chevrolet 164 100  - 22 17 16 Jonathan Smith Chevrolet 163 97  - 23 5 44 Brett Moffitt * Chevrolet 162 94  - 24 26 94 Kristin Bumbera * Dodge 162 91  - 25 25 10 Matt Kurzejewski * Dodge 147 88 Accident - 26 18 23 Jarit Johnson * Chevrolet 130 85 Engine } =Race Statistics= Fastest Qualifier: A.Tardiff *, , 16.562 seconds Time of Race: 1 hour 8 minutes 43 seconds Margin of Victory: .340 seconds Average Speed: Lead changes: 8 among 4 drivers Cautions: 8 for 43 laps Lap Leaders: A.
