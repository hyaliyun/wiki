Skevikare, or Skevikarna, was a Swedish Radical Pietist Christian community founded in ca. 1722 by the \\"Eriksson brothers\\", two Swedish Army officers. After initial prosecution by the Lutheran Orthodox authorities, they went on exile in Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands during 11 years. In 1745 they were allowed to return to Sweden, where they established the community on the island Värmdön in the Stockholm archipelago outside of Stockholm. After having been accepted by the authorities, they received many visitors, including two of Sweden's kings, showing them the respect they were denied for so many years. After Pietism was accepted as a legitimate expression of Lutheranism by the state church authorities, the Skevikare community eventually disestablished around 1830. The literature produced by the community remains preserved by the Royal Library in Stockholm. ==History== Their history is one of the most intriguing of the Radical Pietistic movement in Scandinavia. It started about 1720 with the \\"Eriksson brothers\\" among the Swedish population of west Finland. These two former officers in the Swedish Army preached the Pietist spirituality, why they were soon brought before court, having denied some of the doctrines of the Lutheran Church of Sweden. After a seven-year-long trial they arrived in Stockholm in 1733 to be officially exiled. But instead of awaiting the final decision, they asked for permission to leave the country immediately together with their 60 followers, which was accepted. ===Exile=== View over Altona (1850). They first left for Copenhagen, Denmark, but were not welcomed. So, a sailing ship was bought, and the whole community went aboard. At that time their movement had grown to about 90 persons, some coming over from Sweden and Finland, others joining in Denmark. Then for several years, they had to stay on the ship, sailing up and down the coasts of Denmark and Norway, very seldom allowed to anchor at any harbour. At one time they were being shot at from a town. Another time a woman needed to go ashore to get help to give birth to her child, which she was denied. At winter, they had to anchor outside a desolate coast and dig caves on the shore for the elderly to live in, because of the coldness aboard the ship. Finally, they came to Altona (then belonging to Denmark), a town where many Pietists and Mennonites were living, and could settle there. But not for long. They were too radical even for Altona, and had to leave, not finding a resting place anywhere. So they went to the Netherlands, and had about the same story there. ===The Skevik period=== View from Värmdö (1865), oil painting by King Karl XV (1826–1872). After 11 years of exile hardships living as strangers and pilgrims, they were allowed to return to Sweden in 1745. A wealthy salesman who admired them bought them a farm on the Värmdö island outside of Stockholm. At this farm, called \\"Skevik\\", from which they got their name, they finally settled, and stayed there for the rest of their lives. From there they secretly distributed a lot of Pietistic and mystic literature, keeping in contact with other likeminded Christians all over Northern Europe. During this time they had many visitors, among them even two of Sweden's kings, showing them the respect they were denied for so many years. With the end of the Skevikare community around 1830, the Radical Pietistic movement in Sweden ceased.While there were still some inhabitants left at the Skevik community, a French writer said this of them: \\"We will here make some mention of a sect called Skevikare, established at Wermdoeum, a little island near Stockholm. These people are the remains of those sectaries who, induced by the scruples of a timorous conscience, separated themselves from the Swedish church in 1738.\\" (should be 1728). \\"When they first withdrew themselves from the established religion, they appeared to despise the public mode of worship, the sacraments, and still more, the priests; by which they necessarily drew upon themselves great persecutions, and were even banished the kingdom; but obtained permission in 1746 to reside in Wermdoeum, where they bought some lands called Skevik, from which they are generally named Skevikare. Many of their doctrines are whimsical, but their conduct is virtuous.\\" – Travels through Denmark and Sweden. To which is prefixed, A journal of a voyage down the Elbe from Dresden to Hamburg, Pierre Marie Louis de Boisgelin de Kerdu, 1810. ==Practices== By the locals they were known also as the \\"Främlingarna\\", (\\"Strangers\\"), which they also called themselves, and were described as \\"hermites\\" wearing hodden coats and having long, loose hanging hair spread over their shoulders. When members of their community had died, they usually came to one of Stockholm's graveyards at night, leaving the body on the ground inside the church area's outer wall. Then the priest would bury the corpse the next day. This practice lead to the people of Stockholm beginning to tell ghost stories about that place at nights. ==Legacy== Church of Saint John in Stockholm. There is also a large cave-like formation on Värmdö island, where the Skevikarna used to gather for prayer and meditation. This cave was used in a scene in Ingmar Bergman's movie The Seventh Seal (1957). After the movement's demise, the farm was handed over to the local authorities, and the memory of the Skevikarna faded away. However, about half a century later, a newly arrived priest to the island was handed an old handwritten journal by a parishioner. When the priest sat down at home later in the evening, to read the book, he found that the Skevikarna had recorded their exile story, and he later made it into a small booklet.Gustaf Janzon, \\"Bidrag till Skevikarnes historia\\" (1866) Much of their handwritten literature is preserved at the Royal Library in Stockholm and in Uppsala. ==See also== * Radical Pietism * Ephrata Community ==References== * Alfred Kämpe, \\"Främlingarna på Skevik\\" (1924) Skevikarna Category:1733 in Christianity Category:1745 in Christianity Category:History of Lutheranism in Sweden Category:18th-century Lutheranism ","title":"Skevikarna"},{"id":"19280378","text":"Machadoia is a genus of moths in the family Erebidae.

The screenplay was written by cult erotic horror specialist Jean Rollin, based on the novel Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman by Emmanuelle Arsan. The filming location was Venezuela. Although hardcore scenes were filmed to make this remake of the original 1974 version more edgy, they were not used in any known available cuts except for the French VHS version, which is 10 minutes longer. ==Plot== Emmanuelle lives in Bangkok with her husband Jean, who is several years older. She likes him because he's taught her much sexually, and he likes her because she is very eager to learn. Although both have had extramarital affairs, they tolerate it as they are content with their arrangement. A young woman named Marie-Ange comes to the house to visit with Emmanuelle, and she wants more than talk from her, but Emmanuelle herself is magnetically drawn to an older man named Bee, and one day he invites her to join him \\"in the jungle,\\" to which she does. ==Release== It was released in July 1988 in France, but due to its dwindling popularity (despite the name) and the rise of more conventional hard-core pornography available for home viewing, the film made very little money and was never released worldwide except briefly in Spain and Germany. ==Cast== *Natalie Uher as Emmanuelle *Jean-René Gossart as Professor Simon *Thomas Obermuller as Benton *Gustavo Rodríguez as Tony Harrison *Haydée Balza as Rita *Hassan Guerrar as Carlos *Luis Carlos Mendes as Morales *Tamira as Uma ==References* Category:French films Category:1988 films Category:1980s erotic drama films Category:1980s pornographic films Category:Films shot in Venezuela Category:Films set in Venezuela Category:Emmanuelle Category:French erotic drama films Category:1988 drama films ","title":"Emmanuelle 6"},{"id":"19280454","text":"Magnoptera is a genus of moths in the subfamily Arctiinae.

She was first elected in 2004 as Mayor of Galveston, Texas to succeed Roger Quiroga. She was the third female mayor of Galveston. ==Education and politics== The eldest child of Arthur William and Lyda Kempner Quinn, she attended The Hockaday School in Dallas. She lived in New York City during the early years of her marriage from 1956 to 1972. She attended the University of Texas at Austin and pledged Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, concluding her formal education at Columbia University. Elected to the Galveston City Council in 1998, she served her three-term limit. In 2004 she was elected Mayor of Galveston. Thomas proceeded to serve three terms as mayor, and stepped down in 2010 after reaching her a city-imposed term-limit. ==Hurricane Rita== On September 20, 2005, during Hurricane Rita, Thomas declared a state of emergency and ordered an evacuation effective 6 PM the following day. When added to the panicked flight from Houston, this exacerbated the congestion in the area. She was however praised for her caution, receiving the 2007 National Blueprint Best Practices Award from the National Council on Readiness & Preparedness. ==Hurricane Ike== On August 4, 2008, when Tropical Storm Edouard came ashore, Thomas limited her statements to a warning. When Hurricane Ike approached Galveston, on September 10 at noon Thomas said that although she did not expect to be ordering an evacuation, she asked for a voluntary evacuation of the western part of the island. At 5 PM this hardened to a mandatory order and she suggested voluntary evacuation for the rest of the island. Thomas ordered the full evacuation 9:30 AM on September 11, in a news conference with Galveston County Judge Jim Yarbrough. She told the media at the time that she had wanted to avoid an evacuation order. ==Death== Thomas died on April 19, 2017 at the age of 80 from uterine cancer. She had previously treated successfully for colorectal cancer in 1998. She was the mother of four children (one of whom predeceased her) and the grandmother of two. ==References *Evacuation worked, but created a highway horror O'Driscoll, Patrick; Richard Wolf and Rick Hampson (9/26/2005 7:47 PM).

It was designed by architect Lawrence Fournier as a home for himself and his family. It blends early Prairie School-style elements with American Craftsman architecture. It was also one of the first houses built in North Minneapolis. The Fournier House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995 for having local significance in the theme of architecture/engineering. It was nominated for representing the emergence of Prairie School style within the more established Arts and Crafts movement. ==Setting== In 1908 Lawrence Fournier and his wife Mary purchased a lot in what is now the Cleveland neighborhood in North Minneapolis. The Fourniers' selection of a North Minneapolis lot reveals the increasing appeal of this area of the city to new residents. Minneapolis real estate developers had begun to promote the area's bucolic setting and its easy access to new streetcar lines. As the automobile became more popular and dependable after World War I, development increased at an even more rapid rate. The Cleveland neighborhood was unusually slow to develop, however, and the Fournier House was set in a rural atmosphere until a post-World War II building boom filled in many of the neighborhood's remaining lots. ==Design== Fournier was an architect at the famous firm of Purcell & Elmslie. It became the second-most-commissioned firm of the Prairie School, after Frank Lloyd Wright. However, Fournier's work on the home two years prior to joining the firm shows the influence he had on William Gray Purcell and George Grant Elmslie. Steeped in knowledge of architectural styles, Fournier created a unique concept for the home. Mary Fournier was an artist and also influenced its design. The house the couple built exemplified the common ground between the Craftsman and Prairie Schools. For most of the exterior detailing, Fournier selected the Craftsman style, with its broad, sloping roof pierced by shed dormers. He also created wide, unenclosed eaves, exposed rafter tails, and exposed roof beams supported by knee braces. With a Craftsman sense of economy, he eliminated the vestibule. Instead a sheltered partial-width front porch was built. Fournier used the Craftsman device of an elevated dining room window grouping with space under the windows for closets. Prairie School traits appear within the Craftsman context, creating a mingling of the two styles. For example, a formal Prairie pedestal urn is given an informal Craftsman covering of rustic fieldstones. A Prairie-style band rides the perimeter of the foundation but fails to create much of a horizontal accent on a compact bungalow form. A more successful stylistic blend is found in a Craftsman window box given a Prairie flair as it wraps around a comer-set casement window group. In his choice of materials, Fournier demonstrated concern for a smooth transition between the house and its setting. This concern for landscape was shared by both Prairie and Craftsman designers. The strong fieldstone foundation and rough cast stucco are more in keeping with the Craftsman School. However Fournier included sidewalks of smooth, rose- colored concrete—a trait of the Prairie School. While at Purcell and Elmslie, Fournier served as the firm's expert in the latest domestic engineering gadgetry of the period. He used this knowledge in his own home, designing a central vacuum cleaner, laundry chute, galley kitchen, and rainwater filtration system. ==Influence== The number of Prairie details in the Fournier house reflects the growing prominence of the Prairie School in 1910. Many of the Prairie elements Fournier experimented with in designing his own home appear with increasing frequency in the subsequent work of Purcell and Elmslie. ==History== Lawrence and Mary Fournier lived in the house until 1917, when Lawrence was transferred to Purcell and Elmslie's Chicago office. From 1917 to 1961 the house remained within a single family. Since 1961 there have been several owners. In 1995 the Fournier House was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its expression of high-style house architecture. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Hennepin County, Minnesota ==References== Category:1910 establishments in Minnesota Category:American Craftsman architecture in Minnesota Category:Houses completed in 1910 Category:Houses in Minneapolis Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Minneapolis Category:Prairie School architecture in Minnesota ","title":"Lawrence A. and Mary Fournier House"},{"id":"19280464","text":"Mahensia is a genus of moths in the subfamily Arctiinae.

A contract is legally enforceable because it meets the requirements and approval of the law. A contract typically involves the exchange of goods, service, money, or promise of any of those. \\"Breach of contract\\", means that the law will have to award the injured party either the access to legal remedies such as damages or cancellation. In the Anglo-American common law, formation of a contract generally requires an offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual intent to be bound. Each party must be those who are binding by the contract. Although most oral contracts are binding, some types of contracts may require formalities such as being in writing or by deed.In England, contracts of employment must be in writing (Employment Rights Act 1996), and contracts for the sale of land, and most leases, must be completed by deed (Law of Property Act 1925). In the civil law tradition, contract law is a branch of the law of obligations.This category of \\"obligations\\" is essentially a fusion of contract and tort, and while cases such as Junior Books Ltd v Veitchi Co Ltd promoted this idea, it has fallen out of favour in English legal circles. Each country recognised by private international law has its own national system of law to govern contracts. Although systems of contract law might have similarities, they may contain significant differences. Accordingly, many contracts contain a choice of law clause and a jurisdiction clause. These provisions set the laws of the country which will govern the contract, and the country or other forum in which disputes will be resolved, respectively. Failing express agreement on such matters in the contract itself, countries have rules to determine the law governing the contract and the jurisdiction for disputes. For example, European Member States apply Article 4 of the Rome I Regulation to decide the law governing the contract, and the Brussels I Regulation to decide jurisdiction. ==Formation== At common law, the elements of a contract are; offer, acceptance, intention to create legal relations, consideration, and legality of both form and content. Not all agreements are necessarily contractual, as the parties generally must be deemed to have an intention to be legally bound. A so-called gentlemen's agreement is one which is not intended to be legally enforceable, and \\"binding in honour only\\".Rose & Frank Co. v JR Crompton & Bros Ltd. [1923] 2 K.B. 261, 273 (Bailhache J). Westlaw.Appleson v Littlewoods 1939 & Jones v Vernons Pools 1938.Case summaries ===Offer and acceptance=== In order for a contract to be formed, the parties must reach mutual assent (also called a meeting of the minds). This is typically reached through offer and an acceptance which does not vary the offer's terms, which is known as the \\"mirror image rule\\". An offer is a definite statement of the offeror's willingness to be bound should certain conditions be met. If a purported acceptance does vary the terms of an offer, it is not an acceptance but a counteroffer and, therefore, simultaneously a rejection of the original offer. The Uniform Commercial Code disposes of the mirror image rule in §2-207, although the UCC only governs transactions in goods in the USA. As a court cannot read minds, the intent of the parties is interpreted objectively from the perspective of a reasonable person,DiMatteo L. (1997). The Counterpoise of Contracts: The Reasonable Person Standard and the Subjectivity of Judgment. South Carolina Law Review. as determined in the early English case of Smith v Hughes [1871]. It is important to note that where an offer specifies a particular mode of acceptance, only an acceptance communicated via that method will be valid.. Contracts may be bilateral or unilateral. A bilateral contract is an agreement in which each of the parties to the contract makes a promisepromise legal definition of promise. promise synonyms by the Free Online Law Dictionary or set of promises to each other. For example, in a contract for the sale of a home, the buyer promises to pay the seller $200,000 in exchange for the seller's promise to deliver title to the property. These common contracts take place in the daily flow of commerce transactions, and in cases with sophisticated or expensive precedent requirements, which are requirements that must be met for the contract to be fulfilled. Less common are unilateral contracts in which one party makes a promise, but the other side does not promise anything. In these cases, those accepting the offer are not required to communicate their acceptance to the offeror. In a reward contract, for example, a person who has lost a dog could promise a reward if the dog is found, through publication or orally. The payment could be additionally conditioned on the dog being returned alive. Those who learn of the reward are not required to search for the dog, but if someone finds the dog and delivers it, the promisor is required to pay. In the similar case of advertisements of deals or bargains, a general rule is that these are not contractual offers but merely an \\"invitation to treat\\" (or bargain), but the applicability of this rule is disputed and contains various exceptions.Feinman JM, Brill SR. (2006). Is an Advertisement an Offer? Why it is, and Why it Matters. Hastings Law Journal. The High Court of Australia stated that the term unilateral contract is \\"unscientific and misleading\\".Wilmot et al, 2009, Contract Law, Third Edition, Oxford University Press, page 34 In certain circumstances, an implied contract may be created. A contract is implied in fact if the circumstances imply that parties have reached an agreement even though they have not done so expressly. For example, John Smith, a former lawyer may implicitly enter a contract by visiting a doctor and being examined; if the patient refuses to pay after being examined, the patient has breached a contract implied in fact. A contract which is implied in law is also called a quasi-contract, because it is not in fact a contract; rather, it is a means for the courts to remedy situations in which one party would be unjustly enriched were he or she not required to compensate the other. Quantum meruit claims are an example. ===Invitation to treat=== Where something is advertised in a newspaper or on a poster, the advertisement will not normally constitute an offer but will instead be an invitation to treat, an indication that one or both parties are prepared to negotiate a deal.Partridge v Crittenden [1968] 1 WLR 1204Harris v Nickerson (1873) LR8QB 286Household Fire Insurance v Grant 1879 The Carbolic Smoke Ball offer An exception arises if the advertisement makes a unilateral promise, such as the offer of a reward, as in the famous case of Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co,. decided in nineteenth-century England. The company, a pharmaceutical manufacturer, advertised a smoke ball that would, if sniffed \\"three times daily for two weeks\\", prevent users from catching the 'flu. If the smoke ball failed to prevent 'flu, the company promised that they would pay the user £100, adding that they had \\"deposited £1,000 in the Alliance Bank to show our sincerity in the matter\\". When Mrs Carlill sued for the money, the company argued the advert should not be taken as a serious, legally binding offer; instead it was a \\"mere puff\\"; but the Court of Appeal held that it would appear to a reasonable man that Carbolic had made a serious offer, and determined that the reward was a contractual promise. Although an invitation to treat cannot be accepted, it should not be ignored, for it may nevertheless affect the offer. For instance, where an offer is made in response to an invitation to treat, the offer may incorporate the terms of the invitation to treat (unless the offer expressly incorporates different terms). If, as in the Boots case,Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v. Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd , 1953, 1 Q.B. 401 the offer is made by an action without any negotiations (such as presenting goods to a cashier), the offer will be presumed to be on the terms of the invitation to treat. Auctions are governed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979 (as amended), where section 57(2) provides: “A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion by the fall of the hammer, or in other customary manner. Until the announcement is made any bidder may retract his bid.\\" Electronic contracts Entry into contracts online has become common. Many jurisdictions have passed e-signature laws that have made the electronic contract and signature as legally valid as a paper contract. In India, E-contracts are governed by the Indian Contract Act (1872), according to which certain conditions need to be fulfilled while formulating a valid contact. Certain sections in information Technology Act (2000) also provide for validity of online contract. In some U.S. states, email exchanges have become binding contracts. New York courts in 2016 held that the principles of real estate contracts to apply equally to electronic communications and electronic signatures, so long as “its contents and subscription meet all requirements of the governing statute” and pursuant to the Electronic Signatures and Records Act (ESRA). ===Intention to be legally bound=== In commercial agreements it is presumed that parties intend to be legally bound unless the parties expressly state the opposite as in a heads of agreement document. For example, in Rose & Frank Co v JR Crompton & Bros Ltd, an agreement between two business parties was not enforced because an \\"honour clause\\" in the document stated \\"this is not a commercial or legal agreement, but is only a statement of the intention of the parties\\". In contrast, domestic and social agreements such as those between children and parents are typically unenforceable on the basis of public policy. For example, in the English case Balfour v. Balfour a husband agreed to give his wife £30 a month while he was away from home, but the court refused to enforce the agreement when the husband stopped paying. In contrast, in Merritt v Merritt the court enforced an agreement between an estranged couple because the circumstances suggested their agreement was intended to have legal consequences. ===Consideration=== A concept of English common law, consideration is required for simple contracts but not for special contracts (contracts by deed). The court in Currie v Misa Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 893 declared consideration to be a “Right, Interest, Profit, Benefit, or Forbearance, Detriment, Loss, Responsibility”. Thus, consideration is a promise of something of value given by a promissor in exchange for something of value given by a promisee; and typically the thing of value is goods, money, or an act. Forbearance to act, such as an adult promising to refrain from smoking, is enforceable only if one is thereby surrendering a legal right.Wade v Simeon (1846) 2 CB 548White v Bluett (1853) 2 WR 75Bronaugh R. (1976). Agreement, Mistake, and Objectivity in the Bargain Theory of Conflict. William & Mary Law Review. In Dunlop v. Selfridge Lord Dunedin adopted Pollack's metaphor of purchase and sale to explain consideration. He called consideration 'the price for which the promise of the other is bought'. In colonial times, the concept of consideration was exported to many common law countries, but it is unknown in Scotland and in civil law jurisdictions.Scots lawyer Harvey McGregor's \\"Contract Code\\", a Law Commission-sponsored proposal to both unite and codify English and Scots Law, proposed the abolition of consideration. Roman law-based systemse.g. In Germany, § 311 BGB neither require nor recognise consideration, and some commentators have suggested that consideration be abandoned, and estoppel be used to replace it as a basis for contracts.e.g. P.S. Atiyah, 'Consideration: A Restatement' in Essays on Contract (1986) p.195, Oxford University Press However, legislation, rather than judicial development, has been touted as the only way to remove this entrenched common law doctrine. Lord Justice Denning famously stated that \\"The doctrine of consideration is too firmly fixed to be overthrown by a side- wind.\\". In the United States, the emphasis has shifted to the process of bargaining as exemplified by Hamer v. Sidway (1891). Courts will typically not weigh the \\"adequacy\\" of consideration provided the consideration is determined to be \\"sufficient\\", with sufficiency defined as meeting the test of law, whereas \\"adequacy\\" is the subjective fairness or equivalence. For instance, agreeing to sell a car for a penny may constitute a binding contractChappell & Co Ltd v. Nestle Co Ltd [1959] 2 All ER 701 in which the wrappers from three chocolate bars was held to be part of the consideration for the sale and purchase of a musical recording. (although if the transaction is an attempt to avoid tax, it will be treated by the tax authority as though a market price had been paid). Parties may do this for tax purposes, attempting to disguise gift transactions as contracts. This is known as the peppercorn rule, but in some jurisdictions, the penny may constitute legally insufficient nominal consideration. An exception to the rule of adequacy is money, whereby a debt must always be paid in full for \\"accord and satisfaction\\".\\"Pinnel’s Case\\" (1602) 5 Co Rep 117a\\"Jorden v Money\\" (1854) 5 HLC 185\\"Williams v Roffey Bros and Nicholls (Contractors) Ltd {1990} 1 All ER 512.\\" However, consideration must be given as part of entering the contract, not prior as in past consideration. For example, in the early English case of Eastwood v. Kenyon [1840], the guardian of a young girl took out a loan to educate her. After she was married, her husband promised to pay the debt but the loan was determined to be past consideration. The insufficiency of past consideration is related to the pre-existing duty rule. In the early English case of Stilk v. Myrick [1809], a captain promised to divide the wages of two deserters among the remaining crew if they agreed to sail home short-handed; however, this promise was found unenforceable as the crew were already contracted to sail the ship. The pre-existing duty rule also extends to general legal duties; for example, a promise to refrain from committing a tort or crime is not sufficient.Collins v. Godefroy (1831) 1 B. & Ad. 950. ==Capacity== Sometimes the capacity of either natural or artificial persons to either enforce contracts, or have contracts enforced against them is restricted. For instance, very small children may not be held to bargains they have made, on the assumption that they lack the maturity to understand what they are doing; errant employees or directors may be prevented from contracting for their company, because they have acted ultra vires (beyond their power). Another example might be people who are mentally incapacitated, either by disability or drunkenness.see for a discussion of the position in English law, the article on Capacity in English law Each contractual party must be a \\"competent person\\" having legal capacity. The parties may be natural persons (\\"individuals\\") or juristic persons (\\"corporations\\"). An agreement is formed when an \\"offer\\" is accepted. The parties must have an intention to be legally bound; and to be valid, the agreement must have both proper \\"form\\" and a lawful object. In England (and in jurisdictions using English contract principles), the parties must also exchange \\"consideration\\" to create a \\"mutuality of obligation,\\" as in Simpkins v Pays.Elements of a Contract - Contracts In the United States, persons under 18 are typically minor and their contracts are considered voidable; however, if the minor voids the contract, benefits received by the minor must be returned. The minor can enforce breaches of contract by an adult while the adult's enforcement may be more limited under the bargain principle. Promissory estoppel or unjust enrichment may be available, but generally are not. ==Formalities and writing requirements for some contracts== A contract is often evidenced in writing or by deed, the general rule is that a person who signs a contractual document will be bound by the terms in that document, this rule is referred to as the rule in L'Estrange v Graucob.L'Estrange v Graucob [1934] 2 KB 394. This rule is approved by the High Court of Australia in Toll(FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd.. But a valid contract may (with some exceptions) be made orally or even by conduct.for instance, bidding in auctions, or acting in response to a unilateral offer Remedies for breach of contract include damages (monetary compensation for loss). and, for serious breaches only, repudiation (i.e. cancellation).as in Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd and The Mihalis Angelos The equitable remedy of specific performance, enforceable through an injunction, may be available if damages are insufficient. Typically, contracts are oral or written, but written contracts have typically been preferred in common law legal systems;Michida S. (1992) Contract Societies: Japan and the United States Contrasted. Pacific Rim Law & Policy Journal. in 1677 England passed the Statute of Frauds which influenced similar statute of frauds laws in the United States and other countries such as Australia.In Australia, the Sales of Goods Act applies. In general, the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in the United States requires a written contract for tangible product sales in excess of $500, and real estate contracts are required to be written. If the contract is not required by law to be written, an oral contract is valid and therefore legally binding.Trans-Lex.org: international principle The United Kingdom has since replaced the original Statute of Frauds, but written contracts are still required for various circumstances such as land (through the Law of Property Act 1925). An oral contract may also be called a parol contract or a verbal contract, with \\"verbal\\" meaning \\"spoken\\" rather than \\"in words\\", an established usage in British English with regards to contracts and agreements, and common although somewhat deprecated as \\"loose\\" in American English. If a contract is in a written form, and somebody signs it, then the signer is typically bound by its terms regardless of whether they have actually read it provided the document is contractual in nature.Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co [1951] 1 KB 805 However, affirmative defenses such as duress or unconscionability may enable the signer to avoid the obligation. Further, reasonable notice of a contract's terms must be given to the other party prior to their entry into the contract... An unwritten, unspoken contract, also known as \\"a contract implied by the acts of the parties\\", which can be either an implied-in-fact contract or implied-in-law contract, may also be legally binding. Implied-in-fact contracts are real contracts under which the parties receive the \\"benefit of the bargain\\".. However, contracts implied in law are also known as quasi-contracts, and the remedy is quantum meruit, the fair market value of goods or services rendered. ==Contract terms: construction and interpretation== A contractual term is \\"an[y] provision forming part of a contract\\".Martin, E [ed] & Law, J [ed], Oxford Dictionary of Law, ed6 (2006, London:OUP). Each term gives rise to a contractual obligation, breach of which can give rise to litigation. Not all terms are stated expressly and some terms carry less legal weight as they are peripheral to the objectives of the contract. ===Uncertainty, incompleteness and severance=== If the terms of the contract are uncertain or incomplete, the parties cannot have reached an agreement in the eyes of the law.Fry v. Barnes (1953) 2 D.L.R. 817 (B.C.S.C) An agreement to agree does not constitute a contract, and an inability to agree on key issues, which may include such things as price or safety, may cause the entire contract to fail. However, a court will attempt to give effect to commercial contracts where possible, by construing a reasonable construction of the contract.Hillas and Co. Ltd. v. Arcos Ltd. (1932) 147 LT 503 In New South Wales, even if there is uncertainty or incompleteness in a contract, the contract may still be binding on the parties if there is a sufficiently certain and complete clause requiring the parties to undergo arbitration, negotiation or mediation.See Aiton Australia Pty Ltd v Transfield Pty Ltd (1999) 153 FLR 236 Thompson Reuters Courts may also look to external standards, which are either mentioned explicitly in the contract. or implied by common practice in a certain field.Three Rivers Trading Co., Ltd. v. Gwinear & District Farmers, Ltd. (1967) 111 Sol. J. 831 In addition, the court may also imply a term; if price is excluded, the court may imply a reasonable price, with the exception of land, and second-hand goods, which are unique. If there are uncertain or incomplete clauses in the contract, and all options in resolving its true meaning have failed, it may be possible to sever and void just those affected clauses if the contract includes a severability clause. The test of whether a clause is severable is an objective test—whether a reasonable person would see the contract standing even without the clauses. Typically, non-severable contracts only require the substantial performance of a promise rather than the whole or complete performance of a promise to warrant payment. However, express clauses may be included in a non-severable contract to explicitly require the full performance of an obligation.\\"Cutter v Powell\\" (1795) 101 ER 573 ===Classification of terms=== Contractual terms are classified differently depending upon the context or jurisdiction. Terms establish conditions precedent. English (but not necessarily non-English) common law distinguishes between important conditions and warranties, with a breach of a condition by one party allowing the other to repudiate and be discharged while a warranty allows for remedies and damages but not complete discharge.Gillies P. (1988). Concise Contract Law, p. 105. Federation Press.. Whether or not a term is a condition is determined in part by the parties' intent.Koffman L, MacDonald E. (2007). The Law of Contract. Oxford University Press. In a less technical sense, however, a condition is a generic term and a warranty is a promise. Not all language in the contract is determined to be a contractual term. Representations, which are often precontractual, are typically less strictly enforced than terms, and material misrepresentations historically was a cause of action for the tort of deceit. Warranties were enforced regardless of materiality; in modern United States law the distinction is less clear but warranties may be enforced more strictly. Statements of opinion may be viewed as \\"mere puff\\". In specific circumstances these terms are used differently. For example, in English insurance law, violation of a \\"condition precedent\\" by an insured is a complete defense against the payment of claims. In general insurance law, a warranty is a promise that must be complied with.Burling JM. (2011). Research Handbook on International Insurance Law and Regulation. Edward Elgar Publishing. In product transactions, warranties promise that the product will continue to function for a certain period of time. In the United Kingdom the courts determine whether a term is a condition or warranty; for example, an actress' obligation to perform the opening night of a theatrical production is a condition,Poussard v Spiers and Pond (1876) 1 QBD 410 but a singer's obligation to rehearse may be a warranty.Bettini v Gye (1876) 1 QBD 183 Statute may also declare a term or nature of term to be a condition or warranty; for example the Sale of Goods Act 1979 s15AAs added by the Sale of Goods Act 1994 s4(1). provides that terms as to title, description, quality and sample are generally conditions. The United Kingdom has also contrived the concept of an \\"intermediate term\\" (also called innominate), first established in Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [1962]. ===Representations versus warranties=== Statements of fact in a contract or in obtaining the contract are considered to be either warranties or representations. Traditionally, warranties are factual promises which are enforced through a contract legal action, regardless of materiality, intent, or reliance. Representations are traditionally precontractual statements that allow for a tort-based action (such as the tort of deceit) if the misrepresentation is negligent or fraudulent;Primack MA. (2009). Representations, Warranties and Covenants: Back to the Basics in Contracts. National Law Review. historically, a tort was the only action available, but by 1778, breach of warranty became a separate legal contractual action. In U.S. law, the distinction between the two is somewhat unclear; warranties are viewed as primarily contract-based legal action while negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations are tort-based, but there is a confusing mix of case law in the United States.West GD, Lewis WB. (2009). Contracting to Avoid Extra- Contractual Liability—Can Your Contractual Deal Ever Really Be the \\"Entire\\" Deal? The Business Lawyer. In modern English law, sellers often avoid using the term 'represents' in order to avoid claims under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, while in America 'warrants and represents' is relatively common.Ferara LN, Philips J, Runnicles J. (2007). Some Differences in Law and Practice Between U.K. and U.S. Stock Purchase Agreements. Jones Day Publications. Some modern commentators suggest avoiding the words and substituting 'state' or 'agree', and some model forms do not use the words; however, others disagree.Telman J. (2012). Representations and Warranties. ContractsProf Blog. Statements in a contract may not be upheld if the court finds that the statements are subjective or promotional puffery. English courts may weigh the emphasis or relative knowledge in determining whether a statement is enforceable as part of the contract. In the English case of Bannerman v WhiteBannerman v White [1861 EngR 713]; (1861) 10 CBNS 844, Court of Common Pleas (United Kingdom). the court upheld a rejection by a buyer of hops which had been treated with sulphur since the buyer explicitly expressed the importance of this requirement. The relative knowledge of the parties may also be a factor, as in English case of Bissett v WilkinsonBissett v Wilkinson [1927] AC 177. where the court did not find misrepresentation when a seller said that farmland being sold would carry 2000 sheep if worked by one team; the buyer was considered sufficiently knowledgeable to accept or reject the seller's opinion. ===Standard terms and contracts of adhesion=== Standard form contracts contain \\"boilerplate\\", which is a set of \\"one size fits all\\" contract provisions. However, the term may also narrowly refer to conditions at the end of the contract which specify the governing law provision, venue, assignment and delegation, waiver of jury trial, notice, and escape clauses (\\"get-out clauses\\") such as force majeure. Restrictive provisions in contracts where the consumer has little negotiating power (\\"contracts of adhesion\\") attract consumer protection scrutiny. ===Implied terms=== A term may either be express or implied. An express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document. Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract. Terms implied in fact Terms may be implied due to the factual circumstances or conduct of the parties. In the case of BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings, the UK Privy Council, on appeal from Australia, proposed a five- stage test to determine situations where the facts of a case may imply terms. The classic tests have been the \\"business efficacy test\\" and the \\"officious bystander test\\". Under the \\"business efficacy test\\" first proposed in The Moorcock [1889], the minimum terms necessary to give business efficacy to the contract will be implied. Under the officious bystander test (named in Southern Foundries (1926) Ltd v Shirlaw [1940] but actually originating in Reigate v. Union Manufacturing Co (Ramsbottom) Ltd [1918]), a term can only be implied in fact if an \\"officious bystander\\" listening to the contract negotiations suggested that the term be included the parties would promptly agree. The difference between these tests is questionable. Terms implied in law Statutes or judicial rulings may create implied contractual terms, particularly in standardized relationships such as employment or shipping contracts. The Uniform Commercial Code of the United States also imposes an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in performance and enforcement of contracts covered by the Code. In addition, Australia, Israel and India imply a similar good faith term through laws. In England, some contracts (insurance and partnerships) require utmost good faith, while others may require good faith (employment contracts and agency). Most English contracts do not need any good faith, provided that the law is met. There is, however, an overarching concept of \\"legitimate expectation\\". Most countries have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices. In the United States, prominent examples include, in the case of products, an implied warranty of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, and in the case of homes an implied warranty of habitability. In the United Kingdom, implied terms may be created by: * Statute, such as the Sale of Goods Act 1979, the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and the Hague-Visby Rules; * Common Law, such as The Moorcock,The Moorcock (1889) 14 PD 64. which introduced the \\"business efficacy\\" test; * Previous Dealings, as in Spurling v Bradshaw.. * Custom, as in Hutton v Warren.Hutton v Warren [1836] M&W; 466. Terms implied by custom A term may be implied on the basis of custom or usage in a particular market or context. In the Australian case of Con-Stan Industries of Australia Pty Ltd v Norwich Winterthur (Aust) Limited,. the requirements for a term to be implied by custom were set out. For a term to be implied by custom it needs to be \\"so well known and acquiesced in that everyone making a contract in that situation can reasonably be presumed to have imported that term into the contract\\". ==Third parties== The common law doctrine of privity of contract provides that only those who are party to a contract may sue or be sued on it.Dunlop v Selfridge' [1915] AC 79 House of Lords (UK).Beswick v Beswick [1968] AC 58 House of Lords (UK). The leading case of Tweddle v Atkinson [1861] Tweddle v Atkinson [1861] 121 ER 762 immediately showed that the doctrine had the effect of defying the intent of the parties. In maritime law, the cases of Scruttons v Midland Silicones [1962] Scruttons v Midland Silicones [1962] AC 446 House of Lords (UK). and N.Z. Shipping v Satterthwaite [1975]. established how third parties could gain the protection of limitation clauses within a bill of lading. Some common law exceptions such as agency, assignment and negligence allowed some circumvention of privity rules,Adler v Dickson [1955] QB 158 but the unpopularLord Denning declared that the doctrine had been abolished by 1925 property legislation, but he was overruled by the House of Lords. doctrine remained intact until it was amended by the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 which provides:The 1999 Act does not cover contracts for the carriage of goods by sea, which are instead subject to the Hague-Visby Rules > A person who is not a party to a contract (a “third party”) may in his own > right enforce a contract if: (a) the contract expressly provides that he > may, or (b) the contract purports to confer a benefit on him. ==Performance== Performance varies according to the particular circumstances. While a contract is being performed, it is called an executory contract, and when it is completed it is an executed contract. In some cases there may be substantial performance but not complete performance, which allows the performing party to be partially compensated. Research in business and management has also paid attention to the influence of contracts on relationship development and performance. ==Defenses== Vitiating factors constituting defences to purported contract formation include: * Mistake (such as non est factum) * Incapacity, including mental incompetence and infancy/minority * Duress * Undue influence * Unconscionability * Misrepresentation or fraud * Frustration of purpose Such defenses operate to determine whether a purported contract is either (1) void or (2) voidable. Void contracts cannot be ratified by either party. Voidable contracts can be ratified. ===Misrepresentation=== Misrepresentation means a false statement of fact made by one party to another party and has the effect of inducing that party into the contract. For example, under certain circumstances, false statements or promises made by a seller of goods regarding the quality or nature of the product that the seller has may constitute misrepresentation. A finding of misrepresentation allows for a remedy of rescission and sometimes damages depending on the type of misrepresentation. In a court of law, to prove misrepresentation and/or fraud, there must be evidence that shows a claim was made, said claim was false, the party making the claim knew the claim was false, and that party's intention was for a transaction to occur based upon the false claim. There are two types of misrepresentation: fraud in the factum and fraud in inducement. Fraud in the factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract. If the party did not know that they were entering into a contract, there is no meeting of the minds, and the contract is void. Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable. Assume two people, Party A and Party B, enter into a contract. Then, it is later determined that Party A did not fully understand the facts and information described within the contract. If Party B used this lack of understanding against Party A to enter into the contract, Party A has the right to void the contract. The foundational principle of “caveat emptor,” which means “let the buyer beware,” applies to all American transactions. In Laidlaw v. Organ, the Supreme Court decided that the buyer did not have to inform the seller of information the buyer knew could affect the price of the product. According to Gordon v Selico [1986] it is possible to misrepresent either by words or conduct. Generally, statements of opinion or intention are not statements of fact in the context of misrepresentation. If one party claims specialist knowledge on the topic discussed, then it is more likely for the courts to hold a statement of opinion by that party as a statement of fact.Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon [1976] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 305 It is a fallacy that an opinion cannot be a statement of fact. If a statement is the honest expression of an opinion honestly entertained, it cannot be said that it involves any fraudulent misrepresentations of fact.. For an innocent misrepresentation, the judge takes into account the likelihood a party would rely on the false claim and how significant the false claim was. Remedies for misrepresentation. Rescission is the principal remedy and damages are also available if a tort is established. In order to obtain relief, there must be a positive misrepresentation of law and also, the person to whom the representation was made must have been misled by and relied on this misrepresentation:Public Trustee v Taylor.. Contract law does not delineate any clear boundary as to what is considered an acceptable false claim or what is unacceptable. Therefore, the question is what types of false claims (or deceptions) will be significant enough to void a contract based on said deception. Advertisements utilizing \\"puffing,\\" or the practice of exaggerating certain things, fall under this question of possible false claims. ===Mistake=== A mistake is an incorrect understanding by one or more parties to a contract and may be used as grounds to invalidate the agreement. Common law has identified three types of mistake in contract: common mistake, mutual mistake, and unilateral mistake. *Common mistake occurs when both parties hold the same mistaken belief of the facts. This is demonstrated in the case of Bell v. Lever Brothers Ltd.,Bell v. Lever Brothers Ltd. [1931] ALL E.R. Rep. 1, [1932] A.C. 161 which established that common mistake can only void a contract if the mistake of the subject-matter was sufficiently fundamental to render its identity different from what was contracted, making the performance of the contract impossible.see also . In Great Peace Shipping Ltd v Tsavliris Salvage (International) Ltd, the court held that the common law will grant relief against common mistake, if the test in Bell v. Lever Bros Ltd is made out.. If one party has knowledge and the other does not, and the party with the knowledge promises or guarantees the existence of the subject matter, that party will be in breach if the subject matter does not exist.. *Mutual mistake occurs when both parties of a contract are mistaken as to the terms. Each believes they are contracting to something different. Courts usually try to uphold such mistakes if a reasonable interpretation of the terms can be found. However, a contract based on a mutual mistake in judgment does not cause the contract to be voidable by the party that is adversely affected. See Raffles v Wichelhaus.Raffles v Wichelhaus (1864) 2 Hurl. & C. 906. *Unilateral mistake occurs when only one party to a contract is mistaken as to the terms or subject-matter. The courts will uphold such a contract unless it was determined that the non-mistaken party was aware of the mistake and tried to take advantage of the mistake.Smith v. Hughes [1871].. It is also possible for a contract to be void if there was a mistake in the identity of the contracting party. An example is in Lewis v Avery. where Lord Denning MR held that the contract can only be voided if the plaintiff can show that, at the time of agreement, the plaintiff believed the other party's identity was of vital importance. A mere mistaken belief as to the credibility of the other party is not sufficient. ===Duress and undue influence=== Duress has been defined as a \\"threat of harm made to compel a person to do something against his or her will or judgment; esp., a wrongful threat made by one person to compel a manifestation of seeming assent by another person to a transaction without real volition.\\"Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004) An example is in Barton v Armstrong [1976] in a person was threatened with death if they did not sign the contract. An innocent party wishing to set aside a contract for duress to the person only needs to prove that the threat was made and that it was a reason for entry into the contract; the burden of proof then shifts to the other party to prove that the threat had no effect in causing the party to enter into the contract. There can also be duress to goods and sometimes, 'economic duress'. Undue influence is an equitable doctrine that involves one person taking advantage of a position of power over another person through a special relationship such as between parent and child or solicitor and client. As an equitable doctrine, the court has discretion. When no special relationship exists, the question is whether there was a relationship of such trust and confidence that it should give rise to such a presumption..See also .Odorizzi v. Bloomfield Sch. Dist., 246 Cal. App. 2d 123 (Cal. App. 2d Dist. 1966) ===Unconscionable dealing=== In Australian law, a contract can be set aside due to unconscionable dealing..see also . Firstly, the claimant must show that they were under a special disability, the test for this being that they were unable to act in their best interest. Secondly, the claimant must show that the defendant took advantage of this special disability. ===Illegal contracts=== If based on an illegal purpose or contrary to public policy, a contract is void. In the 1996 Canadian case of Royal Bank of Canada v. NewellRoyal Bank of Canada v. Newell 147 D.L.R (4th) 268 (N.C.S.A.). 1996 case and 1997 appeal. a woman forged her husband's signature, and her husband agreed to assume \\"all liability and responsibility\\" for the forged checks. However, the agreement was unenforceable as it was intended to \\"stifle a criminal prosecution\\", and the bank was forced to return the payments made by the husband. In the U.S., one unusual type of unenforceable contract is a personal employment contract to work as a spy or secret agent. This is because the very secrecy of the contract is a condition of the contract (in order to maintain plausible deniability). If the spy subsequently sues the government on the contract over issues like salary or benefits, then the spy has breached the contract by revealing its existence. It is thus unenforceable on that ground, as well as the public policy of maintaining national security (since a disgruntled agent might try to reveal all the government's secrets during his/her lawsuit).Tenet v. Doe, . Other types of unenforceable employment contracts include contracts agreeing to work for less than minimum wage and forfeiting the right to workman's compensation in cases where workman's compensation is due. ===Remedies for defendant on defenses=== Setting aside the contract There can be four different ways in which contracts can be set aside. A contract may be deemed 'void', 'voidable', 'unenforceable' or 'ineffective'. Voidness implies that a contract never came into existence. Voidability implies that one or both parties may declare a contract ineffective at their wish. Kill fees are paid by magazine publishers to authors when their articles are submitted on time but are subsequently not used for publication. When this occurs, the magazine cannot claim copyright for the \\"killed\\" assignment. Unenforceability implies that neither party may have recourse to a court for a remedy. Ineffectiveness implies that the contract terminates by order of a court where a public body has failed to satisfy public procurement law. To rescind is to set aside or unmake a contract. ==DisputesProcedure=== In many countries, in order to obtain damages for breach of contract or to obtain specific performance or other equitable relief, the aggrieved injured party may file a civil (non-criminal) lawsuit in court. In England and Wales, a contract may be enforced by use of a claim, or in urgent cases by applying for an interim injunction to prevent a breach. Likewise, in the United States, an aggrieved party may apply for injunctive relief to prevent a threatened breach of contract, where such breach would result in irreparable harm that could not be adequately remedied by money damages. Arbitration If the contract contains a valid arbitration clause then, prior to filing a lawsuit, the aggrieved party must submit an arbitration claim in accordance with the procedures set forth in the clause. Many contracts provide that all disputes arising thereunder will be resolved by arbitration, rather than litigated in courts. Arbitration judgments may generally be enforced in the same manner as ordinary court judgments, and are recognized and enforceable internationally under the New York Convention, which has 156 parties. However, in New York Convention states, arbitral decisions are generally immune unless there is a showing that the arbitrator's decision was irrational or tainted by fraud. Some arbitration clauses are not enforceable, and in other cases arbitration may not be sufficient to resolve a legal dispute. For example, disputes regarding validity of registered IP rights may need to be resolved by a public body within the national registration system. For matters of significant public interest that go beyond the narrow interests of the parties to the agreement, such as claims that a party violated a contract by engaging in illegal anti- competitive conduct or committed civil rights violations, a court might find that the parties may litigate some or all of their claims even before completing a contractually agreed arbitration process.See, e.g., =United States= In the United States, thirty-five states (notably not including New York)New York Civil Procedure Law and Rules § 7501, et seq. and the District of Columbia have adopted the Uniform Arbitration Act to facilitate the enforcement of arbitrated judgments. Customer claims against securities brokers and dealers are almost always resolved pursuant to contractual arbitration clauses because securities dealers are required under the terms of their membership in self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (formerly the NASD) or NYSE to arbitrate disputes with their customers. The firms then began including arbitration agreements in their customer agreements, requiring their customers to arbitrate disputes. Choice of law When a contract dispute arises between parties that are in different jurisdictions, law that is applicable to a contract is dependent on the conflict of laws analysis by the court where the breach of contract action is filed. In the absence of a choice of law clause, the court will normally apply either the law of the forum or the law of the jurisdiction that has the strongest connection to the subject matter of the contract. A choice of law clause allows the parties to agree in advance that their contract will be interpreted under the laws of a specific jurisdiction. Within the United States, choice of law clauses are generally enforceable, although exceptions based upon public policy may at times apply. Within the European Union, even when the parties have negotiated a choice of law clause, conflict of law issues may be governed by the Rome I Regulation. Choice of forum Many contracts contain a forum selection clause setting out where disputes in relation to the contract should be litigated. The clause may be general, requiring that any case arising from the contract be filed within a specific state or country, or it may require that a case be filed in a specific court. For example, a choice of forum clause may require that a case be filed in the U.S. State of California, or it may require more specifically that the case be filed in the Superior Court for Los Angeles County. A choice of law or venue is not necessarily binding upon a court. Based upon an analysis of the laws, rules of procedure and public policy of the state and court in which the case was filed, a court that is identified by the clause may find that it should not exercise jurisdiction, or a court in a different jurisdiction or venue may find that the litigation may proceed despite the clause. As part of that analysis, a court may examine whether the clause conforms with the formal requirements of the jurisdiction in which the case was filed (in some jurisdictions a choice of forum or choice of venue clause only limits the parties if the word \\"exclusive\\" is explicitly included in the clause). Some jurisdictions will not accept an action that has no connection to the court that was chosen, and others will not enforce a choice of venue clause when they consider themselves to be a more convenient forum for the litigation.See, e.g., Some contracts are governed by multilateral instruments that require a non-chosen court to dismiss cases and require the recognition of judgments made by courts having jurisdiction based on a choice of court clause. For example, the Brussels regime instruments (31 European states) and the Hague Choice of Court Agreements Convention (European Union, Mexico, Montenegro, Singapore), as well as several instruments related to a specific area of law, may require courts to enforce and recognize choice of law clauses and foreign judgments. ===Remedies=== In the United Kingdom, breach of contract is defined in the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 as: [i] non-performance, [ ii] poor performance, [iii] part-performance, or [iv] performance which is substantially different from what was reasonably expected. Innocent parties may repudiate (cancel) the contract only for a major breach (breach of condition),Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd [1962] 1 All ER 474; see also .The Mihailis Angelos [1971] 1 QB 164 but they may always recover compensatory damages, provided that the breach has caused foreseeable loss. It was not possible to sue the Crown in the UK for breach of contract before 1948. However, it was appreciated that contractors might be reluctant to deal on such a basis and claims were entertained under a petition of right that needed to be endorsed by the Home Secretary and Attorney-General. S.1 Crown Proceedings Act 1947 opened the Crown to ordinary contractual claims through the courts as for any other person. Damages There are several different types of damages. *Compensatory damages, which are given to the party injured by the breach of contract. With compensatory damages, there are two heads of loss, consequential damage and direct damage. In theory, compensatory damages are designed to put the injured party in his or her rightful position, usually through an award of expectation damages. *Liquidated damages are an estimate of loss agreed to in the contract, so that the court avoids calculating compensatory damages and the parties have greater certainty. Liquidated damages clauses may be called \\"penalty clauses\\" in ordinary language, but the law distinguishes between liquidated damages (legitimate) and penalties (invalid). A test for determining which category a clause falls into was established by the English House of Lords in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v New Garage & Motor Co Ltd. *Nominal damages consist of a small cash amount where the court concludes that the defendant is in breach but the plaintiff has suffered no quantifiable pecuniary loss, and may be sought to obtain a legal record of who was at fault. *Punitive or exemplary damages are used to punish the party at fault; but even though such damages are not intended primarily to compensate, nevertheless the claimant (and not the state) receives the award. Exemplary damages are not recognised nor permitted in some jurisdictions. In the UK, exemplary damages are not available for breach of contract, but are possible after fraud. Although vitiating factors (such as misrepresentation, mistake, undue influence and duress) relate to contracts, they are not contractual actions, and so, in a roundabout way, a claimant in contract may be able to get exemplary damages. Compensatory damages compensate the plaintiff for actual losses suffered as accurately as possible. They may be \\"expectation damages\\", \\"reliance damages\\" or \\"restitutionary damages\\". Expectation damages are awarded to put the party in as good of a position as the party would have been in had the contract been performed as promised.. Reliance damages are usually awarded where no reasonably reliable estimate of expectation loss can be arrived at or at the option of the plaintiff. Reliance losses cover expense suffered in reliance to the promise. Examples where reliance damages have been awarded because profits are too speculative include the Australian case of McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission which concerned a contract for the rights to salvage a ship. In Anglia Television Ltd v. Reed[1972] 1 QB 60 the English Court of Appeal awarded the plaintiff expenditures incurred prior to the contract in preparation of performance. After a breach has occurred, the innocent party has a duty to mitigate loss by taking any reasonable steps. Failure to mitigate means that damages may be reduced or even denied altogether.The UCC states, \\"Consequential damages... include any loss... which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.\\" UCC 2-715.In English law the chief authority on mitigation is British Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co v Underground Electric Railway Co of London[1912] AC 673, see especially 689 per Lord Haldane. However, Professor Michael Furmston M.P. Furmston, Cheshire, Fifoot & Furmston's Law of Contract, 15th edn (OUP: Oxford, 2007) p.779. has argued that \\"it is wrong to express (the mitigation) rule by stating that the plaintiff is under a duty to mitigate his loss\\",M.P. Furmston, Cheshire, Fifoot & Furmston's Law of Contract, 15th edn (OUP: Oxford, 2007) p.779 n.130. citing Sotiros Shipping Inc v Sameiet, The Solholt.Sotiros Shipping Inc v Sameiet, The Solholt [1983] 1 Lloyd's Rep 605. If a party provides notice that the contract will not be completed, an anticipatory breach occurs. Damages may be general or consequential. General damages are those damages which naturally flow from a breach of contract. Consequential damages are those damages which, although not naturally flowing from a breach, are naturally supposed by both parties at the time of contract formation. An example would be when someone rents a car to get to a business meeting, but when that person arrives to pick up the car, it is not there. General damages would be the cost of renting a different car. Consequential damages would be the lost business if that person was unable to get to the meeting, if both parties knew the reason the party was renting the car. However, there is still a duty to mitigate the losses. The fact that the car was not there does not give the party a right to not attempt to rent another car. To recover damages, a claimant must show that the breach of contract caused foreseeable loss.See also Alexander v Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd (1987) 9 NSWLR 310. Hadley v Baxendale established that the test of foreseeability is both objective or subjective. In other words, is it foreseeable to the objective bystander, or to the contracting parties, who may have special knowledge? On the facts of this case, where a miller lost production because a carrier delayed taking broken mill parts for repair, the court held that no damages were payable since the loss was foreseeable neither by the \\"reasonable man\\" nor by the carrier, both of whom would have expected the miller to have a spare part in store. Specific performance There may be circumstances in which it would be unjust to permit the defaulting party simply to buy out the injured party with damages. For example, where an art collector purchases a rare painting and the vendor refuses to deliver, the collector's damages would be equal to the sum paid. The court may make an order of what is called \\"specific performance\\", requiring that the contract be performed. In some circumstances a court will order a party to perform his or her promise (an order of \\"specific performance\\") or issue an order, known as an \\"injunction\\", that a party refrain from doing something that would breach the contract. A specific performance is obtainable for the breach of a contract to sell land or real estate on such grounds that the property has a unique value. In the United States by way of the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, specific performance in personal service contracts is only legal \\"as punishment for a crime whereof the criminal shall be dully convicted.\\" Both an order for specific performance and an injunction are discretionary remedies, originating for the most part in equity. Neither is available as of right and in most jurisdictions and most circumstances a court will not normally order specific performance. A contract for the sale of real property is a notable exception. In most jurisdictions, the sale of real property is enforceable by specific performance. Even in this case the defenses to an action in equity (such as laches, the bona fide purchaser rule, or unclean hands) may act as a bar to specific performance. Related to orders for specific performance, an injunction may be requested when the contract prohibits a certain action. Action for injunction would prohibit the person from performing the act specified in the contract. ==History== Whilst early rules of trade and barter have existed since ancient times, modern laws of contract in the West are traceable from the industrial revolution (1750 onwards), when increasing numbers worked in factories for a cash wage. In particular, the growing strength of the British economy and the adaptability and flexibility of the English common law led to a swift development of English contract law. Colonies within the British empire (including the USA and the Dominions) would adopt the law of the mother country. In the 20th century, the growth of export trade led to countries adopting international conventions, such as the Hague-Visby Rules and the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods,Willmott, L, Christensen, S, Butler, D, & Dixon, B 2009 Contract Law, Third Edition, Oxford University Press, North Melbourne to promote uniform regulations. Bill of sale of a male slave and a building in Shuruppak, Sumerian tablet, circa 2600 BC Contract law is based on the principle expressed in the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda, ( \\"agreements must be kept\\").Hans Wehberg, Pacta Sunt Servanda, The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 53, No. 4 (Oct., 1959), p.775.; Trans-Lex.org Principle of Sanctity of contracts The common law of contract originated with the now-defuct writ of assumpsit, which was originally a tort action based on reliance.Atiyah PS. (1986) Medical Malpractice and Contract/Tort Boundary. Law and Contemporary Problems. Contract law falls within the general law of obligations, along with tort, unjust enrichment, and restitution.However, a movement in the 1990s to replace the separate teaching of contract and tort with a unified law of \\"obligations\\" has met with little success. Jurisdictions vary in their principles of freedom of contract. In common law jurisdictions such as England and the United States, a high degree of freedom is the norm. For example, in American law, it was determined in the 1901 case of Hurley v. Eddingfield that a physician was permitted to deny treatment to a patient despite the lack of other available medical assistance and the patient's subsequent death.Blake V. (2012). When Is a Patient-Physician Relationship Established?. Virtual Mentor. This is in contrast to the civil law, which typically applies certain overarching principles to disputes arising out of contract, as in the French Civil Code. Other legal systems such as Islamic law, socialist legal systems, and customary law have their own variations. However, in both the European union and the United States, the need to prevent discrimination has eroded the full extent of freedom of contract. Legislation governing equality, equal pay, racial discrimination, disability discrimination and so on, has imposed limits of the full freedom of contract. For example, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 restricted private racial discrimination against African-Americans.Douglas D. (2002). Contract Rights and Civil Rights. Michigan Law Review. In the early 20th century, the United States underwent the \\"Lochner era\\", in which the Supreme Court of the United States struck down economic regulations on the basis of freedom of contract and the Due Process Clause; these decisions were eventually overturned, and the Supreme Court established a deference to legislative statutes and regulations that restrict freedom of contract.Bernstein DE. (2008). Freedom of Contract. George Mason Law & Economics Research Paper No. 08-51. The US Constitution contains a Contract Clause, but this has been interpreted as only restricting the retroactive impairment of contracts. ==Commercial use== Contracts are widely used in commercial law, and form the legal foundation for transactions across the world. Common examples include contracts for the sale of services and goods (both wholesale and retail), construction contracts, contracts of carriage, software licenses, employment contracts, insurance policies, sale or lease of land, and various other uses. Although the European Union is fundamentally an economic community with a range of trade rules, there is no overarching \\"EU Law of Contract\\". In 1993, Harvey McGregor, a British barrister and academic, produced a \\"Contract Code\\" under the auspices of the English and Scottish Law Commissions, which was a proposal to both unify and codify the contract laws of England and Scotland. This document was offered as a possible \\"Contract Code for Europe\\", but tensions between English and German jurists meant that this proposal has so far come to naught.... indeed the Code was neither published nor adopted by the UK, instead being privately published by an Italian University ==Contract theory== Contract theory is the body of legal theory that addresses normative and conceptual questions in contract law. One of the most important questions asked in contract theory is why contracts are enforced. One prominent answer to this question focuses on the economic benefits of enforcing bargains. Another approach, associated with Charles Fried, maintains that the purpose of contract law is to enforce promises. This theory is developed in Fried's book, Contract as Promise. Other approaches to contract theory are found in the writings of legal realists and critical legal studies theorists. More generally, writers have propounded Marxist and feminist interpretations of contract. Attempts at overarching understandings of the purpose and nature of contract as a phenomenon have been made, notably relational contract theory originally developed by U.S. contracts scholars Ian Roderick Macneil and Stewart Macaulay, building at least in part on the contract theory work of U.S. scholar Lon L. Fuller, while U.S. scholars have been at the forefront of developing economic theories of contract focussing on questions of transaction cost and so-called 'efficient breach' theory. Another dimension of the theoretical debate in contract is its place within, and relationship to a wider law of obligations. Obligations have traditionally been divided into contracts, which are voluntarily undertaken and owed to a specific person or persons, and obligations in tort which are based on the wrongful infliction of harm to certain protected interests, primarily imposed by the law, and typically owed to a wider class of persons. Recently it has been accepted that there is a third category, restitutionary obligations, based on the unjust enrichment of the defendant at the plaintiff's expense. Contractual liability, reflecting the constitutive function of contract, is generally for failing to make things better (by not rendering the expected performance), liability in tort is generally for action (as opposed to omission) making things worse, and liability in restitution is for unjustly taking or retaining the benefit of the plaintiff's money or work.Beatson, Anson's Law of Contract (1998) 27th ed. OUP, p.21 The common law describes the circumstances under which the law will recognise the existence of rights, privilege or power arising out of a promise. ==Gallery== File:Chinese Slave trade.jpgA contract from the Tang dynasty that records the purchase of a 15-year-old slave for six bolts of plain silk and five Chinese coins File:Heiratsbrief Gottfried Werner von Zimmern Apollonia von Henneberg 1521 img02.jpgGerman marriage contract, 1521 between and Apollonia von Henneberg-Römhild File:Insurance Contact 2.jpgThomas Boylston to Thomas Jefferson, May 1786, Maritime Insurance Premiums File:Insurance contract.jpgFire insurance contract of 1796 ==See also== *Arbitration clause *Bill of sale *Conflict of contract laws *Contract awarding *Contract farming *Contract management *Contract of sale *Contract theory (economics) *Contracting *Contractual clauses (category) *Design by contract *Document automation *Electronic signature *Employment contract *Estoppel *Ethical implications in contracts *Force majeure *Further assurances *Gentlemen's agreement *Good faith *Implicit contract *Indenture *Information asymmetry *Invitation to treat *Legal remedy *Letters of assist *Meet-or-release contract *Memorandum of understanding *Negotiation *Option contract *Order (business) *Peppercorn (legal) *Perfect tender rule *Principal–agent problem *Quasi-contract *Restitution *Smart contract *Social contract *Specification (technical standard) *Standard form contract *Stipulation *Tortious interference *Unjust enrichment *Voidable contract ===By country=== *Australian contract law *Sharia *Law of obligations (Bulgaria) *English contract law *German contract law *Indian contract law *South African contract law *United States contract law ==NotesReferences== *Ewan McKendrick, Contract Law - Text, Cases and Materials (2005) Oxford University Press *P.S.

Her father, Leopold, Chief Rabbi, and noted Talmudist, was deported by the Nazis from Yugoslavia before the outbreak of World War II. Unfortunately, more than thirty members of her family were not so lucky and disappeared in the concentration camps. She graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Lyon, just before the outbreak of war. In Belgrade in 1941, she witnessed the city's bombardments by the Nazis. Eva was interned with her mother and her younger brother in the Vallegrande concentration camp on the Croatian island of Korčula under the administration of Italy. This camp was not as terrible the Nazi camps. She was allowed to assist her sick mother with her brother in the Split hospital, where they received permission to be transferred to Bologna. There, in 1943, Fischer was hidden with her family under the surname Venturi. She remembered that period of her life when good Italians tried to help them. At that time Wanda Varotti, Massimo Massei and many other members of the “Partito d’Azione” gave tremendous help to her. At the end of the war Fischer chose Rome as her adopted city. She became a member of a group of artists on Via Margutta, and became close friends with most of them. She met Pablo Picasso at the home of Luchino Visconti and they talked extensively. He pushed her to continue and to progress in the mysterious light of boats and Southern architectures. She moved to Paris, where she lived for a long time in Saint Germain des Près. In Madrid, Fischer’s paintings – finally exhibited in museums – were at the centre of debates between the Margutta artist and the Spanish painters, who were still fighting against Franco’s politics. In the 1960s, Fischer was in London, where she exhibited at the Lefevre Gallery, where the Italian painter Modigliani had been allowed to show his last one man exhibition. In 1992 Italian composer Ennio Morricone composed music for one of her exhibitions.Ennio Morricone A Eva Fischer, Pittore (Forum Studios, 1992) ==NotesReferences== *Cambridge Scientific Abstracts Artbibliographies Modern (Published by Clio Press, 1996) *Paintings by Eva Fischer (Published by Lefevre Gallery, 1960) *Recupero, J.

The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government revenues have grown. An agreement for the years 1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to $228 million for capital development, government operations, and special programs. Since 1992, funding has been extended one year at a time. The Commonwealth received funding of $11 million for infrastructure, for FY96/97 through FY02/03, with an equal local match. == Tourism == A rapidly growing chief source of income is the tourist industry, which now employs around half of the workforce. Chinese and Korean tourists predominate. The agricultural sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches and small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. == Textile industry == Garment production was an industry back then with employment of 12,000 mostly Chinese workers and shipments of $1 billion to the United States in 1998 under duty and quota exemptions. This production is extremely controversial because goods produced in the North Marianas can be labelled \\"Made in the U.S.A.\\", although not all American labor laws apply to the commonwealth leading to what critics charge as \\"sweatshop conditions\\" for imported, mostly Asian, workers. Among other companies, the teen clothing store Abercrombie & Fitch has produced some of their clothing in the Northern Marianas and sold them for high prices. The garment industry is changing, though, and many of the garment factories are closing due to the lifting of WTO trade restrictions on Chinese imports. The industry was initially established in the Commonwealth because some U.S. labor and immigration laws do not apply within the CNMI—for example, the CNMI's minimum wage rate of $6.05 per hour (for most employment positions) is lower than the federal rate, which applies to most other areas of the United States. Additionally, the CNMI retains local control over customs and immigration enforcement, unlike in Guam. In the late 1990s a number of large American textile companies such as Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Sears were criticized for having manufactured clothes in sweatshop conditions in Saipan. In March 2000, a number of defendants, settled a class action suit brought by Saipanese garment workers, which had alleged mistreatment. As part of the settlement, which involved no admission of wrongdoing, Tommy Hilfiger and other companies agreed to independent oversight of their manufacturing in Saipan, a term refused by other defendants such as Lane Bryant and J.C. Penney. In 2004 — and in response to a long and expensive class action lawsuit brought by garment workers against various clothing manufacturers — a Garment Oversight Board, aimed at protecting workers' rights, was created. These actions have reportedly resulted in improved conditions since the turn of the 21st century. == Statistics  GDP === GDP: purchasing power parity – $524 million (1996 est.) note: GDP numbers reflect US spending GDP – real growth rate: NA% GDP – per capita: purchasing power parity – $9,300 (1996 est.)

It aims to explain how economies work and how economic agents interact. == Description of economics == Economics can be described as all of the following: * Academic discipline - body of knowledge given to, or received by, a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialize in. * Field of science - widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are many economics-related scientific journals. ** Social science - field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society. == Branches of economics == * Macroeconomics - branch of economics dealing with the performance, structure, behavior, and decision-making of an economy as a whole, rather than individual markets. * Microeconomics - branch of economics that studies the behavior of individuals and firms in making decisions regarding the allocation of limited resources. ===Subdisciplines of economics=== * Attention economics * Behavioral economics * Bioeconomics * Classical economics * Comparative economic systems * Contract theory * Development economics * Ecological economics * Econometrics * Economic geography * Economic history * Economic sociology * Education economics * Energy economics * Engineering economics * Entrepreneurial economics * Environmental economics * Feminist economics * Financial economics * Georgism * Green economics * Health economics * Industrial organization * Information economics * International economics * Institutional economics * Islamic economics * Labor economics * Law and economics * Managerial economics * Mathematical economics * Monetary economics * Public finance * Public economics * Real estate economics * Regional science * Resource economics * Socialist economics * Welfare economics ===Methodologies or approaches=== * Behavioural economics * Classical economics * Computational economics * Ecological economics * Econometrics * Evolutionary economics * Experimental economics * Praxeology (used by the Austrian School) * Social psychology ===Multidisciplinary fields involving economics=== * Bioeconomics * Constitutional economics * Econophysics * Neuroeconomics * Political economy * Socioeconomics * Thermoeconomics * Transport economics ==Types of economies== Economy -

American Fisheries Society: Bethesda, MD (USA). . IX, 526 + cd-rom pp. page(s): 127 ==Description== This nudibranch grows to about long and feeds on sponges of the genus Dysidea. They are typically large animals, often reaching 50–80 mm. The background colour is dark blue, almost black in some Atlantic specimens, while in the Mediterranean the oldest specimens are usually discoloured, becoming pale blue, somewhat violet. The colouration changes with growth. The smallest animals () have the edge of the mantle with an irregular width and white colour, except for a yellowish band in the middle of the back, looking similar to Felimare gasconi or Felimare orsinii. They also have blackish, rounded spots scattered along the inner side of the edge. At the edge is already yellow in front of the rhinophores and behind the gill, there are still white areas between these areas and the mid-lateral. Between the edge of the mantle becomes totally yellow. The yellow colouration of the dorsum develops from three more or less discontinuous lines that end in the branchial orifice, without forming a circle around it, with only the middle line extending behind the gill. At the head the two lateral lines completely surround the rhinophore orifices of the adults but do not form a closed ring in the youngest ones; in all cases they tend to extend ahead of the rhinophores. In the Azorean specimens there are no orange continuous lines on the back, only spots; slightly aligned or irregularly distributed. In all cases, the Azores animals have a spotted design, those from the Canary Islands have lines and spots, while those from Madeira have the intermediate situation. As the size of the animals increases, the dorsal lines become fragmented, increasing in number and a greater number of yellow spots appear between them, sometimes forming irregular circles. The edge of the mantle is also pigmented, so in large animals the yellow pigment can form on the back a cloud of yellow spots, leaving only remnants of the original lines on the branchial sheath and in front of and behind the rhinophores, although these may also disappear. On the side of the foot there is a more or less intense yellow line and numerous spots and circles whose number increases with the size of the animal. The smaller animals present a simple line, under which there is already at 15 mm a second dashed line of elongated spots. In the anterior part of the foot there is a yellow or orange line. The rhinophores are uniformly coloured, dark blue in the Atlantic and violet blue in the Mediterranean. The gills are dark blue with a yellow rachis. In Mediterranean animals, the external aspect of this spine usually has two convergent lines at the apex, while in the Atlantic it is uniform. The largest number of gills observed was 12 in animals greater than ; frequently in large animals the apex of the gills is bifurcated and even branched. At the usual size of adults of other species, , Felimare picta already has 7 gill leaves. This species presents defensive glandular formations at the edge of the mantle; the most developed are located at the level of the rhinophores and in the lateral and posterior gill areas, although they are found all along the edge of the mantle, except for the middle area of the body. In animals of there are 4-5 glands on the sides of the rhinophores and 6-7 behind the gill, there are also some white spots in the middle of the edge that have a similar appearance. In the specimens, between 5 and 12 mantle glands can be counted on the sides of the rhinophores and from 7 to 24 in the gill area.Debelius, H. & Kuiter, R.H. (2007) Nudibranchs of the world.

Area fans, such as the late Wild Bill Hagy, are known for their passion and reverence for historical sports figures who played in the city or were born there. Among other sports, Baltimore is also known for horse racing. The Preakness Stakes is a 1-3/16 mile (1.91 km) American Grade I stakes race for three-year-old thoroughbred horses, held on the third Saturday in May each year at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. The Preakness Stakes has been termed \\"The Run for the Black-Eyed Susans\\" because a blanket of Black-eyed Susans (Rudbeckia hirta, the state flower of Maryland) is traditionally placed around the winner's neck. The Preakness is the second leg in American thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown series and almost always attracts the Kentucky Derby winner, and some of the other horses that ran in the Derby. ==Major league professional teams== *Baltimore Orioles – Major League Baseball (since 1954) **Three time World Series champions, the 1966 World Series, the 1970 World Series and the 1983 World Series *Baltimore Ravens – National Football League (since 1996) **Two time Super Bowl champions, Super Bowl XXXV (2000) and Super Bowl XLVII (2012) ==Other professional teams== *Baltimore Blast – Major Arena Soccer League (since 1992) *Baltimore Burn – United States Women's Football League (inactive) *Baltimore Nighthawks – Independent Women's Football League (since 2008) *Baltimore Ride – United Women's Lacrosse League (since 2016) Baltimore Bohemians, a USL PDL soccer franchise founded in 2011, finished second in the Mid-Atlantic division in 2013, clinching a playoff berth in their second season. The Bohemians also secured a U.S. Open Cup berth and led the entire 62-team PDL in scoring with 42 league goals. They went on hiatus as of the 2017 season. In 2018, FC Baltimore began play in the National Premier Soccer League out of the Community College of Baltimore County's Essex Stadium. The team won the Mid- Atlantic Conference in its inaugural season, including the largest home victory of the year with a 13–0 win over Legacy 76, and reached the 2018 NPSL National Playoffs as a wildcard team. In 2019, they finished second in the NPSL Mid-Atlantic Division and fell to eventual league champions New York Cosmos B in the Northeast Region Final. Baltimore Blast, a franchise of the Major Arena Soccer League, has been playing at the 1st Mariner Arena since 1992. Originally known as Baltimore Spirit, the team changed its name in 1998. The current name was previously used by another indoor soccer team that played in Baltimore from 1980 to 1992, winning a MISL title in 1984. Since joining the MISL in 2001, the Baltimore Blast have won nine league championships: 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2017 and 2018. The Blast joined the MASL in 2014 upon closure of the MISL. Baltimore has two women's American football teams: the Baltimore Burn (founded 2001) and the Baltimore Nighthawks (founded 2007).

This is seen as a good luck charm for the game to come. When the national anthem is played at an Orioles or Ravens game, the word \\"oh\\" is emphasized in the line \\"oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave\\" by the crowd to show allegiance to the Orioles, using their nickname, the O's. Some national onlookers regard this custom as disrespectful to the nation's anthem. Nicknames are widely used in Baltimore to refer to certain sports figures or moments. Several Orioles players of the modern era have earned themselves nicknames which have quickly become traditional, such as Chris Davis receiving the nickname \\"Crush Davis\\" following his record-setting 2013 season and Nelson Cruz, whose last named is chanted in an elongated fashion whenever he makes a big play at home. The 2012 postseason game between the Ravens and the Broncos has picked up several nicknames, such as the \\"Mile High Miracle\\", the \\"F-bomb\\", and the \\"Rocky Mountain Rainbow\\", each referring particularly to Joe Flacco's pass to Jacoby Jones for a Baltimore touchdown which led to a victory, eventually leading the Ravens to win Super Bowl XLVII. When the Orioles are thrown into situations where they succeed spectacularly, especially when overcoming an adversarial situation, it is known by the Baltimore community as \\"Orioles Magic\\". This term was popularized by the local station WFBR when announcers reacted to Doug DeCinces' walk-off home run over the Detroit Tigers in 1979 by shouting \\"it might get out of here\\", followed by an eruption of fan cheering at Memorial Stadium. Eating Esskay hot dogs and drinking National Bohemian beer at Baltimore sporting events, particularly at Orioles games, has become a long-lasting tradition. National Bohemian is commonly referred to as \\"Natty Boh\\" by venues and Baltimoreans, however no longer served at Oriole Park itself after a marketing dispute involving usage of the Orioles color likeness on cans initiated by owner Peter Angelos. The term \\"Birdland\\" is commonly used to refer to the Baltimore area's fanbase for both the Ravens and the Orioles. MASN, the Orioles' broadcasting network, is commonly accredited with popularizing this term thanks to their promos. The song Seven Nation Army was popularized in Baltimore as the Ravens' official pump-up song. Seven Nation Army was first played at the Ravens opening game of 2011 against the Steelers, and has been played at every home game since. It can often be heard at Orioles games as well. ==See also== *Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum *Sports in Maryland ==References== ","title":"Sports in Baltimore"},{"id":"19280627","text":"The John Lohmar House is a historic house in the Near North neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States.

He was the 14th prime minister of Canada from 1963 to 1968, as the head of two back-to-back Liberal minority governments following elections in 1963 and 1965. During Pearson's time as prime minister, his Liberal minority governments introduced universal health care, the Canada Student Loan Program, the Canada Pension Plan, the Order of Canada, and the Maple Leaf flag. His Liberal government also unified Canada's armed forces. Pearson convened the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, and he kept Canada out of the Vietnam War. In 1967, his government passed Bill C-168, which de facto abolished capital punishment in Canada by restricting it to a few capital offences for which it was never used, and which themselves were abolished in 1976. With these accomplishments, together with his groundbreaking work at the United Nations and in international diplomacy, which included his role in ending the Suez Crisis, Pearson is generally considered among the most influential Canadians of the 20th century and is ranked among the greatest Canadian prime ministers.MacDonald, L.

Accessed 27 May 2017 ==Early life, family, and education== A memorial plaque on the location of his birthplace Pearson was born in Newtonbrook in the township of York, Ontario (now a part of Toronto), the son of Annie Sarah (née Bowles) and Edwin Arthur Pearson, a Methodist (later United Church of Canada) minister. He was the brother of Vaughan Whitier Pearson and Marmaduke Pearson. Lester Pearson's father moved the young family north of Toronto to Aurora, Ontario, where he was the minister at Aurora Methodist Church on Yonge Street. Lester grew up in Aurora and attended the public school on Church Street. The family lived in the Methodist manse at the corner of Spruce and Catherine Streets. The home still exists but is in private hands. Pearson was a member of the Aurora Rugby team. Pearson graduated from Hamilton Collegiate Institute in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1913 at the age of 16. Later that same year, after spending three months at his uncle's emu farm in Australia,Yasuda, Anita \\"Lester Pearson\\"; Weigl;2015. he entered Victoria College at the University of Toronto, where he lived in residence in Gate House and shared a room with his brother Duke. He was later elected to the Pi Gamma Mu social sciences honour society's chapter at the University of Toronto for his outstanding scholastic performance in history and psychology. Just as Northrop Frye and his storied student Margaret Atwood would, along with other luminaries - such as Norman Jewison and E. J. Pratt - Pearson participated in the sophomore theatrical tradition of The Bob Comedy Revue.O'Grady, Conner \\"Despite cuts and critics, Bob carries on\\"; the newspaper; University of Toronto; 18 December 2013. After Victoria College, Pearson won a scholarship to study at St John's College, Oxford, from 1921 to 1923. ===Sporting interests=== At the University of Toronto, Pearson became a noted athlete, excelling in rugby union and also playing basketball. He later also played for the Oxford University Ice Hockey Club while on a scholarship at the University of Oxford, a team that won the first Spengler Cup in 1923. Pearson also excelled in baseball and lacrosse as a youth. His baseball talents as an infielder were strong enough for a summer of semi-pro play with the Guelph Maple Leafs of the Ontario Intercounty Baseball League. Pearson toured North America with a combined Oxford and Cambridge Universities lacrosse team in 1923. After he joined the University of Toronto History Department as an instructor, he helped to coach the U of T's football and hockey teams. He played golf and tennis to high standards as an adult.English (1989–1992), Volume I ==First World War== Salonika During World War I, Pearson volunteered for service as a medical orderly with the University of Toronto Hospital Unit. In 1915, he entered overseas service with the Canadian Army Medical Corps as a stretcher-bearer with the rank of private, and was subsequently promoted to corporal. During this period of service, he spent nearly two years in Southern Europe, being shipped to Egypt and thereafter served on the Salonika Front. He also served alongside the Serbian Army as a medical orderly. On 2 August 1917, Pearson was commissioned a temporary lieutenant. He transferred to the Royal Flying Corps that year, since the Royal Canadian Air Force did not exist at that time, where he served as a flying officer until being sent home with injuries from two accidents. Pearson learned to fly at an air training school in Hendon, England. He survived an airplane crash during his first flight.Lester B. Pearson at The Canadian EncyclopediaLester Bowles Pearson at Library and Archives CanadaLester Bowles Pearson (1897-1972), Canada and the First World War at Library and Archives Canada In 1918, Pearson was hit by a bus in London during a citywide blackout and he was sent home to recuperate, but then he was discharged from the service. It was as a pilot that he received the nickname of \\"Mike\\", given to him by a flight instructor who felt that \\"Lester\\" was too mild a name for an airman. Thereafter, Pearson would use the name \\"Lester\\" on official documents and in public life, but was always addressed as \\"Mike\\" by friends and family. ==Immediate post-war years== After the war, he returned to school, receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto in 1919. He was able to complete his degree after one more term, under a ruling in force at the time, since he had served in the military during the war. He then spent a year working in Hamilton, Ontario and Chicago, in the meat-packing industry, which he did not enjoy. ===Oxford=== Upon receiving a scholarship from the Massey Foundation, he studied for two years at St John's College at the University of Oxford, where he received a B.A. degree with Second-Class honours in modern history in 1923, and the M.A. in 1925. After Oxford, he returned to Canada and taught history at the University of Toronto. ==Marriage, family== In 1925, he married Maryon Moody, from Winnipeg, who had been one of his students at the University of Toronto. Together, they had one son, Geoffrey, and one daughter, Patricia. Although Maryon was initially a highly critical woman with an occasionally short temper during the first two decades of marriage, she supported her husband in all his political endeavors. ==Diplomat, public servant== John Ross McLean, Vincent Massey and Georges Vanier, Canada House, London Ice hockey in Europe; Oxford University vs. Switzerland, 1922. Future Canadian Prime Minister Lester Pearson is at right front. His nickname from the Swiss was \\"Herr Zig-Zag\\". In 1927, after scoring the top marks on the Canadian foreign service entry exam, he then embarked on a career in the Department of External Affairs. Prime Minister R. B. Bennett was a noted talent spotter. He took note of, and encouraged, the young Lester Pearson in the early 1930s, and appointed Pearson to significant roles on two major government inquiries: the 1931 Royal Commission on Grain Futures, and the 1934 Royal Commission on Price Spreads. Bennett saw that Pearson was recognized with an OBE after he shone in that work, arranged a bonus of $1,800, and invited him to a London conference. Pearson was assigned to the High Commission of Canada to the United Kingdom in 1935, and he served there during World War II from 1939 through 1942 as the second-in-command at Canada House, where he coordinated military supply and refugee problems, serving under High Commissioner Vincent Massey. In his book (published as \\"Mike: The Memoirs of the Rt. Hon. Lester B. Pearson, Volume One: 1897-1948\\"), Pearson reveals that during 1940 he was hired by Sir William Stephenson—the enigmatic WWII spymaster known as \\"Intrepid\\"—to serve as a \\"King's Messenger\\" or courier conveying secret documents to Europe. (Ref. A Man Called Intrepid—The Secret War, by William Stevenson (1976). Pearson returned to Ottawa for a few months, where he was an assistant under secretary from 1941 through 1942.EncyclopediaCanadiana (1972) In June 1942 he was posted to the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C., as a ministerial counsellor. He served as second- in-command for nearly two years. Promoted minister plenipotentiary in 1944, he became the second Canadian Ambassador to the United States on 1 January 1945. He remained in this position through September 1946. Pearson had an important part in founding both the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.EncyclopediaCanadiana (1972). \\"He attended many international conferences and was active in the U.N. from its inception.\\" and \\"He signed the North Atlantic Treaty for Canada in 1949 and represented his country at subsequent NATO Council meetings, acting as the chairman in 1951–52.\\" Pearson nearly became the first Secretary-General of the United Nations in 1946, but he was vetoed by the Soviet Union. He was also the leading candidate for Secretary-General in the 1953 selection, when the British conducted a vigorous campaign on his behalf. He placed first with 10 out of 11 votes in the Security Council, but the lone negative vote was another Soviet veto. The Security Council instead settled on Dag Hammarskjöld of Sweden; all UN Secretaries-General would come from neutral countries for the rest of the Cold War. The Canadian Prime Minister, Mackenzie King, tried to recruit Pearson into his government as the war wound down. Pearson felt honoured by King's approach, but he resisted at the time, due to his personal dislike of King's poor personal style and political methods.Hutchison (1964) Pearson did not make the move into politics until a few years later, after King had announced his retirement as the Prime Minister of Canada. ==Early political career== Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent (far left) and Pearson (far right) welcome UK Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill and Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden at Rockcliffe Airport, Ottawa, on 29 June 1954. In 1948, before his retirement, Prime Minister King appointed Pearson Secretary of State for External Affairs (foreign minister) in the Liberal government. Shortly afterward, Pearson won a seat in the House of Commons, for the federal riding of Algoma East in Northern Ontario. Pearson then served as Secretary of State for External Affairs for Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, until the defeat of the St. Laurent government in 1957. ==Nobel Peace Prize== Lester B. Pearson quote on the Peacekeeping Monument In 1957, for his role in resolving the Suez Crisis through the United Nations, Pearson was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The selection committee argued that Pearson had \\"saved the world\\", but critics accused him of betraying the motherland and Canada's ties with the UK. Pearson and UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld are considered the fathers of the modern concept of peacekeeping. Together, they were able to organize the United Nations Emergency Force by way of a five-day fly-around in early November 1956. His Nobel medal is on permanent display in the front lobby of the Lester B. Pearson Building, the headquarters of Global Affairs Canada in Ottawa. ==Party leadership== Pearson presiding at a plenary session of the founding conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in 1945. St. Laurent was defeated by the Progressive Conservatives under John Diefenbaker in the election of 1957. After just a few months as Leader of the Opposition, St. Laurent retired, and he endorsed Pearson as his successor. Pearson was elected leader of the Liberal Party at its leadership convention of 1958, defeating his chief rival, former cabinet minister Paul Martin, Sr. At his first parliamentary session as Opposition Leader, Pearson asked Diefenbaker to give power back to the Liberals without an election, because of a recent economic downturn. This strategy backfired when Diefenbaker showed a classified Liberal document saying that the economy would face a downturn in that year. This contrasted heavily with the Liberals' campaign promises of 1957. Consequently, Pearson's party was routed in the federal election of 1958. The Liberals lost more than half their seats, while Diefenbaker's Conservatives won the largest majority ever seen in Canada to that point (208 of 265 seats). Furthermore, the election cost the Liberals their stronghold in Quebec. This province had voted largely Liberal in federal elections since the Conscription Crisis of 1917, but Quebec had no favourite son leader, as it had had since 1948. Pearson convened a significant \\"Thinkers' Conference\\" at Kingston, Ontario in 1960. This event developed many of the ideas later implemented when he became the Prime Minister. In the federal election of 1962, the Liberals, led by Pearson, and the surprise election of 30 Social Credit MP's, deprived the Tories of their majority. As a consequence, Diefenbaker now had to preside over a minority government. Not long after the election, Pearson capitalized on the Conservatives' indecision on accepting American nuclear warheads on Canadian BOMARC missiles. Defence Minister Douglas Harkness resigned from Cabinet on 4 February 1963, because of Diefenbaker's opposition to accepting the warheads. On the next day, the government lost two nonconfidence motions on the issue, forcing a national election. In that election, the Liberals took 129 seats to the Tories' 95. Despite winning 41 percent of the vote, the Liberals came up five seats short of a majority largely because of winning just three seats on the Prairies. With the support of six Social Credit MPs from Quebec, Pearson was able to guarantee stable government to the Governor-General, and Diefenbaker resigned, allowing Pearson to form a minority government. He was sworn in as the Prime Minister on 22 April 1963. Even though the support the Social Credit MPs was soon withdrawn, Pearson was able to maintain government with the support of the New Democratic Party. ==Prime Minister (1963–1968)== Statue on Parliament Hill grounds Pearson, and three of his cabinet ministers who later became Prime Ministers. From left to right, Pierre Trudeau, John Turner, Jean Chrétien, and Pearson. Pearson campaigned during the election promising \\"60 Days of Decision\\" and supported the Bomarc surface-to-air missile program. Pearson never had a majority in the House of Commons, but he brought in many of Canada's major updated social programs, including universal health care, the Canada Pension Plan, and Canada Student Loans, and he instituted a new national flag, the Maple Leaf flag. He also instituted the 40-hour work week, two weeks vacation time, and a new minimum wage. On 15 January 1964, Pearson became the first Canadian Prime Minister to make an official state visit to France. Pearson signed the Canada–United States Automotive Agreement (or Auto Pact) in January 1965, and unemployment fell to its lowest rate in over a decade. While in office, Pearson declined U.S. requests to send Canadian combat troops into the Vietnam War. Pearson spoke at Temple University in Philadelphia on 2 April 1965, while visiting the United States and reportedly voiced his support for a pause in the American bombing of North Vietnam, so that a diplomatic solution to the crisis may unfold. To President Lyndon B. Johnson, this criticism of American foreign policy on American soil was an intolerable sin. Before Pearson had finished his speech, he was summoned to Camp David, Maryland, to meet with Johnson the next day. Johnson, who was notorious for his personal touch in politics, reportedly grabbed Pearson by the lapels and shouted, \\"Don't you come into my living room and piss on my rug.\\" A book review of Text of his Philadelphia speech, however, showed that Pearson in fact supported President Johnson's policy in Vietnam, even stating \\"The government and great majority of people of my country have supported wholeheartedly the US peacekeeping and peacemaking policies in Vietnam.\\" Pearson later recounted that the meeting was acrimonious, but insisted the two parted cordially. After this incident, L.B.J. and Pearson did have further contacts, including two more meetings together, both times in Canada as the United States relied on Canada's raw materials and resources to fuel and sustain its efforts in the Vietnam War. Also . Pearson also started a number of Royal Commissions, including the Royal Commission on the Status of Women and the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism. These suggested changes that helped create legal equality for women, and brought official bilingualism into being. After Pearson's term in office, French was made an official language, and the Canadian government provided services in both English and French. Pearson himself had hoped that he would be the last unilingual Prime Minister of Canada and fluency in both English and French became an unofficial requirement for candidates for Prime Minister after Pearson left office. Pearson's government endured significant controversy in Canada's military services throughout the mid-1960s, following the tabling of the White Paper on Defence in March 1964. This document laid out a plan to merge the Royal Canadian Navy, the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the Canadian Army to form a single service called the Canadian Forces. Military unification took effect on 1 February 1968, when The Canadian Forces Reorganization Act received Royal Assent. Pearson has been credited with instituting the world's first race-free immigration system. Credit for who created the policy, however, is disputed, and likely should be shared with John Diefenbaker. Diefenbaker's government in 1962 introduced a new race-free policy; however, under the 1962 policy, Americans were still given an advantage. It was in 1967 that Pearson introduced a discrimination-free points-based system which encouraged immigration to Canada, a forerunner of the system still in place today. Pearson also oversaw Canada's centennial celebrations in 1967 before retiring. The Canadian news agency, The Canadian Press, named him \\"Newsmaker of the Year\\" that year, citing his leadership during the centennial celebrations, which brought the Centennial Flame to Parliament Hill. Also in 1967, the President of France, Charles de Gaulle, made a visit to Quebec. During that visit, de Gaulle was a staunch advocate of Quebec separatism, even going so far as to say that his procession in Montreal reminded him of his return to Paris after it was freed from the Nazis during the Second World War. President de Gaulle also gave his \\"Vive le Québec libre\\" speech during the visit. Given Canada's efforts in aiding France during both world wars, Pearson was enraged. He rebuked de Gaulle in a speech the following day, remarking that \\"Canadians do not need to be liberated\\" and made it clear that de Gaulle was no longer welcome in Canada. ==Supreme Court appointments== Pearson chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the Supreme Court of Canada by the Governor General: * Robert Taschereau (as Chief Justice, 22 April 1963 – 1 September 1967; appointed a Puisne Justice under Prime Minister King, 9 February 1940) * Wishart Flett Spence (30 May 1963 – 29 December 1978) * John Robert Cartwright (as Chief Justice, 1 September 1967 – 23 March 1970; appointed a Puisne Justice under Prime Minister St. Laurent, 22 December 1949) * Louis-Philippe Pigeon (21 September 1967 – 8 February 1980) ==Retirement== Pearson's gravestone in Wakefield, Quebec After his 14 December 1967 announcement that he was retiring from politics, a leadership convention was held. Pearson's successor was Pierre Trudeau, whom Pearson had recruited and made justice minister in his cabinet. Two other cabinet ministers Pearson had recruited, John Turner and Jean Chrétien, served as prime ministers following Trudeau's retirement. From 1968 to 1969, Pearson served as chairman of the Commission on International Development (the Pearson Commission), which was sponsored by the World Bank. Immediately following his retirement, he lectured in history and political science at Carleton University while writing his memoirs. From 1970 to 1972, he was the first chairman of the Board of Governors of the International Development Research Centre. From 1969 until his death in 1972, he was chancellor of Carleton University in Ottawa. ==Illness and death== In 1970, Pearson underwent a surgery to have his right eye removed in order to remove a tumor in that area. Pearson had planned at the time to write a three-volume set of memoirs, and had published Volume One by 1972. He had finished but a few chapters of Volume Two when, in November 1972, it was reported that he was admitted to the hospital for further unspecified treatment, but the prognosis was poor. He tried to write at this juncture the story of his prime ministerial career, but his condition, which was already precarious, deteriorated rapidly by Christmas Eve. On 27 December 1972, it was announced that the cancer had spread to the liver and Pearson had lapsed into a coma. He died at 11:40 pm ET on 27 December 1972 in his Ottawa home. Pearson is buried at MacLaren Cemetery in Wakefield, Quebec (just north of Gatineau), next to his close External Affairs colleagues H. H. Wrong and Norman Robertson. ==Honours and awards== 115x30px115x30px 115x30px115x30px115x30px 115x30px115x30px115x30px {  - style=\\"background:silver;\\" align=\\"center\\" Ribbon  Description  Notes - 80px  Order of Merit (OM)  * 1971 - 80px  Companion of the Order of Canada (CC)  * Awarded on 28 June 1968. - centre  Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE)  * During the brief revival of Imperial Honours during the premiership of the Right Honourable Richard Bedford Bennett between 1931 and 1935. - - x25px  1914–15 Star  * As a member of the Canadian Armed Forces - x25px  British War Medal  * As a member of the Canadian Armed Forces - 80px  Victory Medal (United Kingdom)  * As a member of the Canadian Armed Forces - x25px  Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal  * 1953 * As a member of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and an elected Member of the House of Commons of Canada, the then Honourable Lester B.

Its purpose was probably entirely to conquer the Canaries, and to eventually be fully incorporated into the Crown of Castile when complete. ==First contact by Europeans== Apart from earlier contact by Romans, one of the first known Europeans to have encountered the Canaries was the Genoan navigator Lancelotto Malocello. He arrived on the island of Lanzarote, (which was probably named after him), in 1312 and stayed for almost two decades until he was expelled during a revolt by the native Guanche under the leadership of their king Zonzamas. ==Conquest== The conquest of the Canaries was started in 1402 by French-Norman explorer Jean de Béthencourt. He had set sail from France one year earlier with a small army. He started the conquest in a rather friendly way by taking over the island of Lanzarote with the help of the locals. They would soon also take Fuerteventura and El Hierro. Their present king Guadarfia was the grandson of Zonzamas, who was king when Lancelotto Malocello had visited the island earlier. When Béthencourt left the island for reinforcements from Castile, unrest broke out because of fighting between Norman officer Gadifer de la Salle and Berthin, in which the natives had been involved. However, Béthencourt managed to calm the situation when he returned, and the Guanche leader was baptized on February 27, 1404, thus surrendering to the Europeans. Subsequently, Jean de Béthencourt was proclaimed king of the Canaries by Pope Innocent VII, even though he recognized the Castilians as overlords. The remaining islands, La Gomera, Gran Canaria, Tenerife and La Palma, were gradually conquered over the course of a century or so. The native kings of Tenerife surrender to Javier Alonso Fernández de Lugo, July 25, 1496. Jean de Béthencourt was, after his death, succeeded by his nephew Maciot de Béthencourt, who turned out to be a tyrant. He established Teguise as the new capital. The Portuguese had been competing with the Castilians for the islands. The Castilians suspected that Maciot would sell the islands to them, which he did in 1448. Neither the natives nor the Castilians approved, and this led to a revolt which lasted until 1459 when the Portuguese were forced to leave. Portugal formally recognised Castile as the ruler of the Canary Islands in 1479 as part of the Treaty of Alcáçovas. The military governor Alonso Fernández de Lugo finally conquered the islands of La Palma (in 1492–1493) and Tenerife (in 1494–1496) for the Crown of Castile, thus completing the conquest of the island group. ==Sources== * * * Category:States and territories established in 1402 Category:15th-century establishments in Castile Category:History of the Canary Islands Category:Invasions by the Normans ","title":"Kingdom of the Canary Islands"},{"id":"19280679","text":"The Pilar Bayona Piano Competition was a piano competition held in Zaragoza in memory of pianist Pilar Bayona (1897-1979).

It is a mainline Christian denomination divided into nine provinces. The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church is Michael Bruce Curry, the first African-American bishop to serve in that position. the Episcopal Church had 1,798,042 baptized members, of whom 1,637,945 were in the United States. it was the nation's 14th largest denomination. Note: The number of members given here is the total number of baptized members in 2012 (cf. Baptized Members by Province and Diocese 2002–2013). Pew Research estimated that 1.2 percent of the adult population in the United States, or 3 million people, self-identify as mainline Episcopalians. The church was organized after the American Revolution, when it became separate from the Church of England, whose clergy are required to swear allegiance to the British monarch as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. The Episcopal Church describes itself as \\"Protestant, yet Catholic\\". The Episcopal Church claims apostolic succession, tracing its bishops back to the apostles via holy orders. The Book of Common Prayer, a collection of traditional rites, blessings, liturgies, and prayers used throughout the Anglican Communion, is central to Episcopal worship. The Episcopal Church was active in the Social Gospel movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1960s and 1970s, the church has pursued a decidedly more liberal course. It has opposed the death penalty and supported the civil rights movement and affirmative action. The church calls for the full legal equality of LGBT people. In 2015, the church's 78th triennial General Convention passed resolutions allowing the blessing of same- sex marriages and approved two official liturgies to bless such unions. ==Names== Flag of the Episcopal Church \\"The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America\\" (PECUSA) and \\"The Episcopal Church\\" (TEC) are both official names specified in the church's constitution. The latter is much more commonly used. In other languages, an equivalent is used. For example, in Spanish, the church is called La Iglesia Episcopal Protestante de los Estados Unidos de América or La Iglesia Episcopal. and in French L'Église protestante épiscopale des États-Unis d'Amérique or L'Église épiscopale. Until 1964, \\"The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America\\" was the only official name in use. In the 19th century, High Church members advocated changing the name, which they felt did not acknowledge the church's Catholic heritage. They were opposed by the church's evangelical wing, which felt that the \\"Protestant Episcopal\\" label accurately reflected the Reformed character of Anglicanism. After 1877, alternative names were regularly proposed and rejected by the General Convention. One proposed alternative was \\"the American Catholic Church\\". By the 1960s, opposition to dropping the word \\"Protestant\\" had largely subsided. In a 1964 General Convention compromise, priests and lay delegates suggested adding a preamble to the church's constitution, recognizing \\"The Episcopal Church\\" as a lawful alternate designation while still retaining the earlier name. The 66th General Convention voted in 1979 to use the name \\"The Episcopal Church\\" in the Oath of Conformity of the Declaration for Ordination. The evolution of the name can be seen in the church's Book of Common Prayer. In the 1928 BCP, the title page read, \\"According to the use of The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America\\", whereas on the title page of the 1979 BCP it states, \\"'According to the use of The Episcopal Church\\". The Episcopal Church in the United States of America (ECUSA) has never been an official name of the church but is an alternative commonly seen in English. Since several other churches in the Anglican Communion also use the name \\"Episcopal\\", including Scotland and the Philippines, some, for example Anglicans Online, add the phrase \\"in the United States of America\\". The full legal name of the national church corporate body is the \\"Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America\\", which was incorporated by the legislature of New York and established in 1821. The membership of the corporation \\"shall be considered as comprehending all persons who are members of the Church\\". This should not be confused with the name of the church itself, as it is a distinct body relating to church governance. ==HistoryColonial era=== St. Luke's Church, built during the 17th century near Smithfield, Virginia - the oldest Anglican church-building to have survived largely intact in North America. The Episcopal Church has its origins in the Church of England in the American colonies, and it stresses continuity with the early universal Western Church and claims to maintain apostolic succession (though the Catholic and Orthodox churches do not recognize this claim). The first parish was founded in Jamestown, Virginia in 1607, under the charter of the Virginia Company of London. The tower of Jamestown Church ( 1639–43) is one of the oldest surviving Anglican church structures in the United States. The Jamestown church building itself is a modern reconstruction. Although no American Anglican bishops existed in the colonial era, the Church of England had an official status in several colonies, which meant that local governments paid tax money to local parishes, and the parishes handled some civic functions. The Church of England was designated the established church in Virginia in 1609, in New York in 1693, in Maryland in 1702, in South Carolina in 1706, in North Carolina in 1730, and in Georgia in 1758. From 1635 the vestries and the clergy came loosely under the diocesan authority of the Bishop of London. After 1702, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) began missionary activity throughout the colonies. On the eve of Revolution about 400 independent congregations were reported throughout the colonies. Bruton Parish Church in Colonial Williamsburg, established in 1674. The current building was completed in 1715. ===Revolutionary era=== Embracing the symbols of the British presence in the American colonies, such as the monarchy, the episcopate, and even the language of the Book of Common Prayer, the Church of England almost drove itself to extinction during the upheaval of the American Revolution. More than any other denomination, the War of Independence internally divided both clergy and laity of the Church of England in America, and opinions covered a wide spectrum of political views: patriots, conciliators, and loyalists. While many Patriots were suspicious of Loyalism in the church, about three-quarters of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were nominally Anglican laymen, including Thomas Jefferson, William Paca, and George Wythe. It was often assumed that persons considered \\"High Church\\" were Loyalists, whereas persons considered \\"Low Church\\" were Patriots: assumptions with possibly dangerous implications for the time. Old North Church in Boston. Inspired by the work of Christopher Wren, it was completed in 1723. Of the approximately three hundred clergy in the Church of England in America between 1776 and 1783, over 80 percent in New England, New York, and New Jersey were loyalists. This is in contrast to the less than 23 percent loyalist clergy in the four southern colonies. Many Church of England clergy remained loyalists as they took their two ordination oaths very seriously. Anglican clergy were obliged to swear allegiance to the king as well as to pray for the king, the royal family, and the British Parliament. In general, loyalist clergy stayed by their oaths and prayed for the king or else suspended services. By the end of 1776, some Anglican churches were closing. Anglican priests held services in private homes or lay readers who were not bound by the oaths held morning and evening prayer. During 1775 and 1776, the Continental Congress had issued decrees ordering churches to fast and pray on behalf of the patriots. Starting July 4, 1776, Congress and several states passed laws making prayers for the king and British Parliament acts of treason. The patriot clergy in the South were quick to find reasons to transfer their oaths to the American cause and prayed for the success of the Revolution. One precedent was the transfer of oaths during the Glorious Revolution in England. Most of the patriot clergy in the South were able to keep their churches open and services continued. ===Early Republic era=== In the wake of the Revolution, American Episcopalians faced the task of preserving a hierarchical church structure in a society infused with republican values. Trinity Church in Swedesboro, New Jersey. Originally serving a Church of Sweden congregation, it became an Episcopal church in 1786, when this building was completed. When the clergy of Connecticut elected Samuel Seabury as their bishop in 1783, he sought consecration in England. The Oath of Supremacy prevented Seabury's consecration in England, so he went to Scotland; the non-juring bishops of the Scottish Episcopal Church consecrated him in Aberdeen on November 14, 1784, making him, in the words of scholar Arthur Carl Piepkorn, \\"the first Anglican bishop appointed to minister outside the British Isles\\". On August 3, 1785, the first ordinations on American soil took place at Christ Church in Middletown, Connecticut. By 1786, the church had succeeded in translating episcopacy to America and in revising the Book of Common Prayer to reflect American political realities. Later, through the efforts of Bishop Philander Chase (1775–1852) of Ohio, Americans successfully sought material assistance from England for the purpose of training Episcopal clergy. The development of the Protestant Episcopal Church provides an example of how Americans in the early republic maintained important cultural ties with England. In 1787, two priests – William White of Pennsylvania and Samuel Provoost of New York – were consecrated as bishops by the archbishop of Canterbury, the archbishop of York, and the bishop of Bath and Wells, the legal obstacles having been removed by the passage through Parliament of the Consecration of Bishops Abroad Act 1786. Thus there are two branches of Apostolic succession for the American bishops: through the non- juring bishops of Scotland who consecrated Samuel Seabury and through the English church who consecrated William White and Samuel Provoost. All bishops in the American Church are ordained by at least three bishops. One can trace the succession of each back to Seabury, White and Provoost. (See Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church.) In 1789, representative clergy from nine dioceses met in Philadelphia to ratify the church's initial constitution. The Episcopal Church was formally separated from the Church of England in 1789 so that clergy would not be required to accept the supremacy of the British monarch. A revised version of the Book of Common Prayer was written for the new church that same year. The fourth bishop of the Episcopal Church was James Madison, the first bishop of Virginia. Madison was consecrated in 1790 by the Archbishop of Canterbury and two other Church of England bishops. This third American bishop consecrated within the English line of succession occurred because of continuing unease within the Church of England over Seabury's non- juring Scottish orders. The Episcopal Church thus became the first Anglican Province outside the British Isles. On 17 September 1792, at the triennial general convention (synod) of the Episcopal Church at Trinity Church on Wall Street, in New York City, Thomas John Claggett was elected the first bishop of Maryland. He was the first bishop of the Episcopal Church ordained and consecrated in America and the fifth Bishop consecrated for the Episcopal Church in the United States. ===Nineteenth century=== St. John's Episcopal Church, built in 1816 in Washington, D.C., is known as the \\"Church of the Presidents\\" for the many presidents who have worshiped there. In 1856 the first society for African Americans in the Episcopal Church was founded by James Theodore Holly. Named The Protestant Episcopal Society for Promoting The Extension of The Church Among Colored People, the society argued that blacks should be allowed to participate in seminaries and diocesan conventions. The group lost its focus when Holly emigrated to Haiti, but other groups followed after the Civil War. The current Union of Black Episcopalians traces its history to the society. Holly went on to found the Anglican Church in Haiti, where he became the first African-American bishop on November 8, 1874. As Bishop of Haiti, Holly was the first African American to attend the Lambeth Conference. However, he was consecrated by the American Church Missionary Society, an Evangelical Episcopal branch of the Church. Episcopal missions chartered by African-Americans in this era were chartered as a Colored Episcopal Mission. All other missions (white) were chartered as an Organized Episcopal Mission. Many historically Black parishes are still in existence to date. St. John's Episcopal Church in Montgomery, Alabama, established in 1834. The church building was completed in 1855. The Secession Convention of Southern Churches was held here in 1861. When the American Civil War began in 1861, Episcopalians in the South formed the Protestant Episcopal Church in the Confederate States of America. However, in the North the separation was never officially recognized. By May 16, 1866, the southern dioceses had rejoined the national church. By the middle of the 19th century, evangelical Episcopalians disturbed by High Church Tractarianism, while continuing to work in interdenominational agencies, formed their own voluntary societies, and eventually, in 1874, a faction objecting to the revival of ritual practices established the Reformed Episcopal Church. Samuel David Ferguson was the first black bishop consecrated by the Episcopal Church, the first to practice in the U.S. and the first black person to sit in the House of Bishops. Bishop Ferguson was consecrated on June 24, 1885, with the then-Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church acting as a consecrator. During the Gilded Age, highly prominent laity such as banker J. P. Morgan, industrialist Henry Ford, and art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner played a central role in shaping a distinctive upper class Episcopalian ethos, especially with regard to preserving the arts and history. These philanthropists propelled the Episcopal Church into a quasi-national position of importance while at the same time giving the church a central role in the cultural transformation of the country. Another mark of influence is the fact that more than a quarter of all presidents of the United States have been Episcopalians (see religious affiliations of Presidents of the United States). It was during this period that the Book of Common Prayer was revised, first in 1892 and later in 1928. ===Era of change (1958–1970s)=== At the 1958 general convention, a coalition of liberal church members succeeded in passing a resolution recognizing \\"the natural dignity and value of every man, of whatever color or race, as created in the image of God\\". It called on Episcopalians \\"to work together, in charity and forbearance, towards the establishment ... of full opportunities in fields such as education, housing, employment and public accommodations\\". In response, the Episcopal Society for Cultural and Racial Unity (ESCRU) was founded in December 1959 in order to eliminate racial, ethnic and class barriers within the Episcopal Church. Opposition from southern church leaders prevented the Episcopal Church from taking a strong stand on civil rights prior to 1963. One prominent opponent of the movement was Charles C.J. Carpenter, the Bishop of Alabama. By 1963, many church leaders felt more comfortable speaking out in support of racial equality. That year, Presiding Bishop Arthur Lichtenberger wrote a pastoral letter urging Christians to work \\"across lines of racial separation, in a common struggle for justice\\", and the House of Bishops endorsed civil rights legislation. In 1967, Lichtenberger's successor, John Hines led the Episcopal Church to implement the General Convention Special Program (GCSP). The program was designed to redirect nine million dollars over a three-year period (a quarter of the church's operating budget at the time) to fund special grants for community organizations and grassroots efforts facilitating black empowerment in America's urban ghettos. The effectiveness of the GCSP was limited due to the reluctance of conservative bishops in southern dioceses, who objected to the awarding of grants to groups perceived as radical. The GCSP also drew opposition from the recently formed Foundation for Christian Theology, a conservative organization opposed to \\"involv[ing] the Church in the social, political, and economic activities of our times\\". The tension between liberal and conservative constituencies in the church erupted during the Special General Convention of 1969. The convention was disrupted by black militants who demanded that the Episcopal Church hear their concerns. When white deputies objected to allowing the militants a hearing, African-American deputies walked out of the convention. The Special General Convention also witnessed protests of the Vietnam War. During this time period, African-American clergy organized the Union of Black Episcopalians to achieve full inclusion of African Americans at all levels of the Episcopal Church. The liberal policies of Presiding Bishop Hines and the general conventions of 1967 and 1969 led to a conservative reaction. Facing declining membership and a one million dollar budget cut, the Special Program became an easy target for conservatives, who succeeded in drastically reducing the financial support for the program in 1970. It was finally ended in 1973 with little protest. A year later, Hines was succeeded by John M. Allin, the Bishop of Mississippi and a conservative. The first women were admitted as delegates to the church's general convention in 1970. In 1975, Vaughan Booker, who confessed to the murder of his wife and was sentenced to life in prison, was ordained to the diaconate in Graterford State Prison's chapel in Pennsylvania, after having repented of his sins, becoming a symbol of redemption and atonement. ===Recent history=== In recent decades, the Episcopal Church, like other mainline churches, has experienced a decline in membership as well as internal controversy over women's ordination and the place of homosexuals in the church. The 1976 General Convention also passed a resolution calling for an end to apartheid in South Africa and in 1985 called for \\"dioceses, institutions, and agencies\\" to create equal opportunity employment and affirmative action policies to address any potential \\"racial inequities\\" in clergy placement. Because of these and other controversial issues including abortion, individual members and clergy can and do frequently disagree with the stated position of the church's leadership. In January 2016, the Anglican Primates Meeting at Canterbury decided that in response to the \\"distance\\" caused by what it called \\"unilateral action on matters of doctrine without catholic unity\\", \\"for a period of three years, The Episcopal Church [would neither] represent [the Communion] on ecumenical and interfaith bodies… [nor] take part in decision making on any issues pertaining to doctrine or polity.\\" Revised prayer book In 1976, the General Convention adopted a new prayer book, which was a substantial revision and modernization of the previous 1928 edition. It incorporated many principles of the Roman Catholic Church's liturgical movement, which had been discussed at Vatican II. This version was adopted as the official prayer book in 1979 after an initial three-year trial use. Several conservative parishes, however, continued to use the 1928 version. Ordination of women On July 29, 1974, a group of women known as the Philadelphia Eleven were irregularly ordained as priests in the Episcopal Church by bishops Daniel Corrigan, Robert L. DeWitt, and Edward R. Welles, assisted by Antonio Ramos. On September 7, 1975, four more women (the \\"Washington Four\\") were irregularly ordained by retired bishop George W. Barrett. In the wake of the controversy over the ordination of the Philadelphia Eleven, the General Convention permitted the ordination of women in 1976 and recognized the ordinations of the 15 forerunners. The first women were canonically ordained to the priesthood in 1977. The first woman to become a bishop, Barbara Harris, was consecrated on February 11, 1989. At the same time, there was still tolerance for those dioceses who opposed women's ordination. In 1994, the General Convention affirmed that there was value in the theological position that women should not be ordained. In 1997, however, the General Convention then determined that \\"the canons regarding the ordination, licensing, and deployment of women are mandatory\\" and required noncompliant dioceses to issue status reports on their progress towards full compliance.The Archives of the Episcopal Church, Acts of Convention: Resolution #1997-A053, Implement Mandatory Rights of Women Clergy under Canon Law. Retrieved 2008-10-31. In 2006, the General Convention elected Katharine Jefferts Schori as Presiding Bishop. She is the first and, currently, the only woman to become a primate in the Anglican Communion. Schori's election was controversial in the wider Anglican Communion because not all of the communion recognizes the ordination of women. At the time of the formation of the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA), three U.S. dioceses did not ordain women as priests or bishops: San Joaquin, Quincy, and Fort Worth. Following the departures of their conservative majorities, all three dioceses now ordain women. With the October 16, 2010, ordination of Margaret Lee, in the Peoria- based Diocese of Quincy, Illinois, women have been ordained as priests in all 110 dioceses of the Episcopal Church in the United States. Affirmation of LGBT people The Episcopal Church affirmed at the 1976 General Convention that homosexuals are \\"children of God\\" who deserve acceptance and pastoral care from the church and equal protection under the law. The first openly gay person ordained as a priest was Ellen Barrett in 1977. Despite such an affirmation of gay rights, the General Convention affirmed in 1991 that \\"physical sexual expression\\" is only appropriate within the monogamous lifelong \\"union of husband and wife\\". Gene Robinson in 2013 The church elected its first openly gay bishop, Gene Robinson, in June 2003. News of Robinson's election caused a crisis in both the American church and the wider Anglican Communion. In October 2003, Anglican primates (the heads of the Anglican Communion's 38 member churches) convened an emergency meeting. The meeting's final communiqué included the warning that if Robinson's consecration proceeded, it would \\"tear the fabric of the communion at its deepest level\\". The news of his ordination caused such an outrage that during the ceremony, at which his long-time partner was present, Robinson was forced to wear a bullet- proof vest beneath his vestments, and he also received numerous death threats following his installation as bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New Hampshire. In 2009, the General Convention charged the Standing Commission on Liturgy and Music to develop theological and liturgical resources for same-sex blessings and report back to the General Convention in 2012. It also gave bishops an option to provide \\"generous pastoral support\\", especially where civil authorities have legalized same-gender marriage, civil unions, or domestic partnerships. On July 14, 2009, the Episcopal Church's House of Bishops voted that \\"any ordained ministry\\" is open to gay men and lesbians. The New York Times said the move was \\"likely to send shockwaves through the Anglican Communion\\". This vote ended a moratorium on ordaining gay bishops passed in 2006 and passed in spite of Archbishop Rowan Williams's personal call at the start of the convention that, \\"I hope and pray that there won't be decisions in the coming days that will push us further apart.\\" On July 10, 2012, the Episcopal Church approved an official liturgy for the blessing of same-sex relationships. This liturgy was not a marriage rite, but the blessing included an exchange of vows and the couple's agreement to enter into a lifelong committed relationship. On June 29, 2015, at the 78th General Convention of the Episcopal Church, a resolution removing the definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman was passed by the House of Bishops with 129 in favor, 26 against, and 5 abstaining. The current Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, expressed \\"deep concern\\" over the ruling. In 2016, Anglican leaders temporarily suspended the Episcopal Church from key positions in their global fellowship in response to the church changing its canons on marriage. Transgender people have also joined the priesthood in the Episcopal Church. The Rev. Cameron Partridge, who transitioned in 2001 and was ordained in 2005 was the first openly transgender priest to preach at the Washington National Cathedral.  Separations from the church  Diocese of South Carolina left the Episcopal Church in 2012, eventually becoming a diocese of the Anglican Church in North America Following the ordination of Bp. Gene Robinson in 2003, some members of a number of congregations left the Episcopal Church. For example, in Cleveland, Ohio, four parishes \\"with about 1,300 active members, decided to leave the U.S. church and the local diocese because of 'divergent understandings of the authority of scripture and traditional Christian teaching.'\\" Four dioceses also voted to leave the church; Pittsburgh, Quincy, Fort Worth, and San Joaquin. The stated reasons included those expressed by the Pittsburgh diocese, which complained that the church had been \\"hijacked\\" by liberal bishops. A few years later, in 2012, the Diocese of South Carolina voted to withdraw. The Episcopal Church did not acknowledge any of the purported diocesan withdrawals, stating that under canon law an Episcopal diocese cannot withdraw itself from the larger Episcopal Church. In a \\"pastoral letter\\" to the South Carolina diocese, Presiding Bishop Schori wrote that \\"While some leaders have expressed a desire to leave The Episcopal Church, the Diocese has not left. It cannot, by its own action. The alteration, dissolution, or departure of a diocese of The Episcopal Church requires the consent of General Convention, which has not been consulted.\\"Episcopal News Service (November 15, 2012). \\"Presiding Bishop's Pastoral Letter to Episcopalians in South Carolina\\". She further wrote that the South Carolina diocese \\"continues to be a constituent part of The Episcopal Church, even if a number of its leaders have departed. If it becomes fully evident that those former leaders have, indeed, fully severed their ties with The Episcopal Church, new leaders will be elected and installed by action of a Diocesan Convention recognized by the wider Episcopal Church, in accordance with our Constitution and Canons.\\" Many departing members joined the Continuing Anglican movement or advocated Anglican realignment, claiming alignment with overseas Anglican provinces including the Anglican Province of the Southern Cone of America and the Church of Nigeria. Some former members formed the Anglican Church in North America which, as of 2017, claimed over 1,000 congregations and 134,000 members. Episcopal Church leaders, particularly former Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori, responded by taking a firm stance against the separatists. Litigation between the church and departing dioceses and parishes cost all parties tens of millions of dollars; one estimate has the Episcopal Church spending over $42 million and separatists roughly $18 million, for a total of over $60 million in court costs. Litigation has largely centered around church properties. Episcopal leadership asserts that, as a hierarchical church, they retain ownership of parish property when parishioners leave. Departing groups, in contrast, assert that they should be able to retain ownership of individual church facilities and diocesan property. Church property disputes In a letter to the House of Bishops during summer 2009, Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori instructed local dioceses not to sell parish property to departing groups. She stated: \\"We do not make settlements that encourage religious bodies who seek to replace The Episcopal Church\\". Before Schori took this stand, prior bishops had treated parish property disputes as internal diocesan matters that are \\"not subject to the review or oversight of the presiding bishop\\". One example was when then-Presiding Bishop Frank Griswold told the Diocese of Western Louisiana on May 11, 2006, that the national church involved itself in parish property disputes only upon invitation of the local bishop and diocesan standing committees. Schori's letter stated that her firm stance was the consensus of the Council of Advice and expressed hope that \\"those who have departed can gain clarity about their own identity\\". After the South Carolina diocese voted to withdraw, it sued the national Episcopal Church to retain control over its property. The departing diocese initially won, but mostly lost on appeal to the South Carolina Supreme Court. Seven parishes affiliated with the departing group were allowed to keep their property. All other church and diocesan property in the lawsuit remained with the Episcopal Church and its affiliated local diocese. The name \\"Episcopal Diocese of South Carolina\\" and related names and marks were initially claimed by the departing group. In 2019, a federal court ruled that they legally belonged to the Episcopal Church and its South Carolina affiliates. ==Membership== Shreveport, Louisiana , the Episcopal Church reported 1,835,931 baptized members. The majority of members are in the United States, where the Church has 1,676,349 members. Outside of the U.S. the Church has 159,582. Total average Sunday attendance (ASA) for 2018 was 562,529 (533,206 in the U.S. and 29,323 outside the U.S.), a decrease of 24.7% percent from 2008. According to a report by ARIS/Barna in 2001, 3.5 million Americans self–identified as Episcopalians, highlighting \\"a gap between those who are affiliated with the church (on membership rolls), versus those who self- identify [as Episcopalians]\\". Church Pension Group also cited having 3.5 million adherents in 2002. More recently, in 2014, Pew Research found that approximately 1.2 percent of 245 million U.S adults, around 3 million people, self–identified as mainline Episcopalian/Anglican. According to data collected in 2000, the District of Columbia, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Virginia have the highest rates of adherents per capita, and states along the East Coast generally have a higher number of adherents per capita than in other parts of the country. New York was the state with the largest total number of adherents, over 200,000. In 2013, the Episcopal Diocese of Haiti was the largest single diocese, with 84,301 baptized members, which constitute slightly over half of the church's foreign membership. According to the latest statistics U.S. membership dropped 2.7 percent from a reported 1,866,758 members in 2013 to 1,745,156 in 2016, a loss of 121,602 persons. Attendance took an even steeper hit, with the average number of Sunday worshipers dropping from 623,691 in 2013 to 570,454 in 2016, a decline of 53,237 persons in the pews, down 8.5 percent. Congregations dropped to 6,473. The Episcopal Church experienced notable growth in the first half of the 20th century, but like many mainline churches, it has had a decline in membership in more recent decades. Membership grew from 1.1 million members in 1925 to a peak of over 3.4 million members in the mid-1960s. Between 1970 and 1990, membership declined from about 3.2 million to about 2.4 million. Once changes in how membership is counted are taken into consideration, the Episcopal Church's membership numbers were broadly flat throughout the 1990s, with a slight growth in the first years of the 21st century. A loss of 115,000 members was reported for the years 2003–05. Some theories about the decline in membership include a failure to sufficiently reach beyond ethnic barriers in an increasingly diverse society, and the low fertility rates prevailing among the predominant ethnic groups traditionally belonging to the church. In 1965, there were 880,000 children in Episcopal Sunday School programs. By 2001, the number had declined to 297,000. ==Influence== In the twentieth century, Episcopalians tended to be wealthier and more educated (having more graduate and postgraduate degrees per capita) than most other religious groups in the United States,Irving Lewis Allen, \\"WASP—From Sociological Concept to Epithet,\\" Ethnicity, 1975 154+ and were disproportionately represented in the upper reaches of American business, law, and politics. According to Pew Research Center Episcopal Church \\"has often been seen as the religious institution most closely associated with the American establishment, producing many of the nation’s most important leaders in politics and business.\\" And about a quarter of the presidents (11) were members of the Episcopal Church. In the 1970s, a Fortune magazine study found one-in-five of the country's largest businesses and one-in-three of its largest banks was run by an Episcopalian. Numbers of the most wealthy and affluent American families such as the Vanderbilts, Astors, Whitneys, Morgans and Harrimans are Episcopalians. The Episcopal Church also has the highest number of graduate and post-graduate degrees per capita (56%) of any other Christian denomination in the United States, as well as the most high-income earners. According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Episcopalians ranked as the third wealthiest religious group in the United States, with 35% of Episcopalians living in households with incomes of at least $100,000. In recent years, the church has become much more economically and racially diverse through evangelism, and has attracted many Hispanic immigrants who are often working-class. ==Structure== The Episcopal Church is governed according to episcopal polity with its own system of canon law. This means that the church is organized into dioceses led by bishops in consultation with representative bodies. It is a unitary body, in that the power of the General Convention is not limited by the individual dioceses. The church has, however, a highly decentralized structure and characteristics of a confederation. ===Parishes and dioceses=== At the local level, there are 6,447 Episcopal congregations, each of which elects a vestry or bishop's committee. Subject to the approval of its diocesan bishop, the vestry of each parish elects a priest, called the rector, who has spiritual jurisdiction in the parish and selects assistant clergy, both deacons and priests. (There is a difference between vestry and clergy elections – clergy are ordained members usually selected from outside the parish, whereas any member in good standing of a parish is eligible to serve on the vestry.) The diocesan bishop, however, appoints the clergy for all missions and may choose to do so for non-self- supporting parishes. The middle judicatory consists of a diocese headed by a bishop who is assisted by a standing committee. The bishop and standing committee are elected by the diocesan convention whose members are selected by the congregations. The election of a bishop requires the consent of a majority of standing committees and diocesan bishops. Conventions meet annually to consider legislation (such as revisions to the diocesan constitution and canons) and speak for the diocese. Dioceses are organized into nine provinces. Each province has a synod and a mission budget, but it has no authority over its member dioceses. There are 110 dioceses in the United States, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Haiti, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Venezuela and the Virgin Islands. The Convocation of Episcopal Churches in Europe and the Navajoland Area Mission are jurisdictions similar to a diocese. The Presiding Bishop is one of three Anglican primates who together exercise metropolitan jurisdiction over the Episcopal Church of Cuba, which is an extraprovincial diocese in the Anglican Communion. ===National church=== The Washington National Cathedral is the seat of the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church as well as the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington.The Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul in the City and Diocese of Washington, located in Washington, D.C., is operated under the more familiar name of Washington National Cathedral. The highest legislative body of the Episcopal Church is the triennial General Convention, consisting of the House of Deputies and the House of Bishops. All active (whether diocesan, coadjutor, suffragan, or assistant) and retired bishops make up the over 300 members of the House of Bishops. Diocesan conventions elect over 800 representatives (each diocese elects four laity and four clergy) to the House of Deputies. The House of Deputies elects a president and vice-president to preside at meetings. General Convention enacts two types of legislation. The first type is the rules by which the church is governed as contained in the Constitution and Canons; the second type are broad guidelines on church policy called resolutions. Either house may propose legislation. The House of Deputies only meets as a full body once every three years; however, the House of Bishops meets regularly throughout the triennium between conventions. The real work of General Convention is done by interim bodies, the most powerful being the Executive Council, which oversees the work of the national church during the triennium. The council has 40 members; 20 are directly elected by the General Convention, 18 are elected by the nine provinces, and the Presiding Bishop and President of the House of Deputies are ex officio members. Other interim bodies include a number of standing commissions which study and draft policy proposals for consideration and report back to General Convention. Each standing commission consists of three bishops, three priests or deacons, and six laypersons. Bishops are appointed by the Presiding Bishop while the other clergy and laypersons are appointed by the president of the House of Deputies. The Presiding Bishop is elected from and by the House of Bishops and confirmed by the House of Deputies for a nine-year term. The Presiding Bishop is the chief pastor and primate of the Episcopal Church and is charged with providing leadership in the development of the Church's program as well as speaking on behalf of the Church.The Episcopal Church (2009), Constitution and Canons, Title I Canon 2. The Presiding Bishop does not possess a territorial see; since the 1970s, however, the Presiding Bishop has enjoyed extraordinary jurisdiction (metropolitical authority) and has authority to visit dioceses for sacramental and preaching ministry, for consulting bishops, and for related purposes. The Presiding Bishop chairs the House of Bishops as well as the Executive Council of the General Convention. In addition, the Presiding Bishop directs the Episcopal Church Center, the national administrative headquarters of the denomination. Located at 815 Second Avenue, New York City, New York, the center is often referred to by Episcopalians simply as \\"815\\". A system of ecclesiastical courts is provided for under Title IV of the canons of General Convention. These courts are empowered to discipline and depose deacons, priests, and bishops. ==Worship and liturgy== St. Mary's Episcopal Cathedral, Memphis, Tennessee, in 2002 Rood screen and chancel ceiling at the Anglo-Catholic Church of the Good Shepherd (Rosemont, Pennsylvania) Worship according to the Book of Common Prayer (BCP) is central to the Episcopal Church's identity and its main source of unity. The current edition of the BCP was published in 1979 and is similar to other Anglican prayer books in use around the world. It contains most of the worship services (or liturgies) used in the Episcopal Church. The Episcopal Church has a sacramental understanding of worship. The Episcopal catechism defines a sacrament as \\"an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given to us\\". Episcopalians believe that sacraments are material things that God uses to act in human lives. The BCP identifies Baptism and the Eucharist as the \\"two great sacraments of the Gospel\\". Confirmation, ordination, holy matrimony, reconciliation of a penitent, and unction are identified as \\"sacramental rites\\". Private confession of sin is available in the Episcopal Church, though it is not as commonly practiced as in the Roman Catholic Church. This is in part due to the general confession provided for in Episcopal services. The prayer book specifies that the Eucharist or Holy Communion is \\"the principal act of Christian worship on the Lord's Day\\". The service has two parts. The first is centered on Bible readings and preaching. At each service, four scripture passages are read from the Old Testament and the New Testament. The readings are organized in a three-year cycle during which much of the Bible will have been read in church. The second part of the service is centered on the Eucharist. The Episcopal Church teaches the real presence doctrine—that the bread and wine truly become the body and blood of Christ. However, it does not define how this happens, which allows for different views to coexist within the church. Generally, Episcopal churches have retained features such as the altar rail, the inclusion or exclusion of which does not elicit much controversy, but usually celebrate in the versus populum orientation. High altar of an Anglo-Catholic church ad orientem style Often a congregation or a particular service will be referred to as Low Church or High Church. In theory: * High Church, especially the very high Anglo-Catholic movement, is ritually inclined towards the use of incense, formal hymns, and a higher degree of ceremony such as ad orientem in relation to the priest and altar. In addition to clergy vesting in albs, stoles, and chasubles, the lay assistants may also be vested in cassock and surplice. The sung Eucharist tends to be emphasized in High Church congregations, with Anglo-Catholic congregations and celebrants using sung services almost exclusively. Marian devotion is sometimes seen in the Anglo- Catholic and some High Church parishes. * Low Church is simpler and may incorporate other elements such as informal praise and worship music. \\"Low\\" parishes tend towards a more \\"traditional Protestant\\" outlook with its emphasis of Biblical revelation over symbolism. A few \\"low\\" parishes even subscribe to traditional Evangelical theology (see Evangelical Anglicanism). The spoken Eucharist tends to be emphasized in Low Church congregations. Altar rails may be omitted in this type. * Broad Church indicates a middle ground. These parishes are the most common within The Episcopal Church. However, unlike the Anglican Church in England, most Episcopal \\"broad church\\" parishes make use of a liturgy that includes eucharistic vestments, chant, and a high view of the sacraments, even if the liturgy is not as solemn or lacks some of the other accoutrements typical of Anglo-Catholic parishes. Unlike many Roman Catholic churches, the altar rail has usually been retained and communion is usually served kneeling at the altar rail similar to a Tridentine Mass, because the Episcopal Church teaches, through its Book of Common Prayer, a theologically high view of the church and its sacraments, even if not all parishes carry this out liturgically. The Book of Common Prayer also provides the Daily Offices of Morning and Evening Prayer. The daily offices can be said by lay people at home. The veneration of saints in the Episcopal Church is a continuation of an ancient tradition from the early church which honors important people of the Christian faith. The usage of the term \\"saint\\" is similar to Roman Catholic and Orthodox traditions. There are explicit references in the 1979 Book of Common Prayer to invoking the aid of the prophets, patriarchs, saints, martyrs and the Virgin Mary as in an optional prayer in the committal at a funeral, p. 504\\\\. In general Anglicans pray with the saints in their fellowship, not to them, although their intercessions may be requested. Those inclined to the Anglo-Catholic traditions may explicitly invoke saints as intercessors in prayer. The 1979 edition contains a provision for the use of \\"traditional\\" (Elizabethan) language under various circumstances not directly provided for in the book, and the Anglican Service Book was produced accordingly, as \\"a traditional language adaptation of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer together with the Psalter or Psalms of David and Additional Devotions\\". ==Belief and practice== The episcopal consecration of the 8th bishop of Northern Indiana in 2016 by the laying on of hands The center of Episcopal teaching is the life and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Doctrine of the Episcopal Church is found in the Canon of Holy Scripture as understood in the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds and in the sacramental rites, the Ordinal and Catechism of the Book of Common Prayer. Some of these teachings include: * Jesus Christ is fully human and fully God. He died and was resurrected from the dead. * Jesus provides the way of eternal life for those who believe. * God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ), and God the Holy Spirit, are one God, and are called the Holy Trinity (\\"three and yet one\\"). * The Old and New Testaments of the Bible were written by people \\"under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit\\". The Apocrypha are additional books that are used in Christian worship, but not for the formation of doctrine. * The two great and necessary sacraments are Holy Baptism and Holy Eucharist. * Other sacramental rites are confirmation, ordination, marriage, reconciliation of a penitent, and unction. * Belief in heaven, hell, and Jesus' return in glory. * Emphasis on living out the Great Commandment to love God and neighbor fully.Joseph Buchanan Bernardin, An Introduction to the Episcopal Church (2008) p. 63 The full catechism is included in the Book of Common Prayer and is posted on the Episcopal website. In practice, not all Episcopalians hold all of these beliefs, but ordained clergy are required to \\"solemnly engage to conform\\" to this doctrine. The Episcopal Church follows the via media or \\"middle way\\" between Protestant and Roman Catholic doctrine and practices: that is both Catholic and Reformed. Although many Episcopalians identify with this concept, those whose convictions lean toward either evangelical Anglicanism or Anglo-Catholicism may not. A broad spectrum of theological views is represented within the Episcopal Church. Some Episcopal members or theologians hold evangelical positions, affirming the authority of scripture over all. The Episcopal Church website glossary defines the sources of authority as a balance between scripture, tradition, and reason. These three are characterized as a \\"three-legged stool\\" which will topple if any one overbalances the other. It also notesAuthority, Sources of (in Anglicanism) on the Episcopal Church site, accessed on April 19, 2007, which in turn credits Church Publishing Incorporated, New York, NY, from An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, A User Friendly Reference for Episcopalians, Don S. Armentrout and Robert Boak Slocum, editors. This balance of scripture, tradition and reason is traced to the work of Richard Hooker, a 16th-century apologist. In Hooker's model, scripture is the primary means of arriving at doctrine and things stated plainly in scripture are accepted as true. Issues that are ambiguous are determined by tradition, which is checked by reason.Anglican Listening on the Episcopal Church site goes into detail on how scripture, tradition, and reason work to \\"uphold and critique each other in a dynamic way\\". Noting the role of personal experience in Christian life, some Episcopalians have advocated following the example of the Wesleyan Quadrilateral of Methodist theology by thinking in terms of a \\"Fourth Leg\\" of \\"experience\\". This understanding is highly dependent on the work of Friedrich Schleiermacher. A public example of this struggle between different Christian positions in the church has been the 2003 consecration of Gene Robinson, an openly gay man living with a long-term partner. The acceptance/rejection of his consecration is motivated by different views on the understanding of scripture.As stated in section 2.16 of To Set Our Hope On Christ (PDF), because \\"the biblical writers [...] write at different times and in different circumstances, they do not always agree with one another. [...] For example, it is helpful to know that when Ezra (chapter 10) commands the men of Israel to divorce their wives, it is because they had married foreign wives, who are seen to be a danger to Israel in exile. But there is another belief about foreign wives in the Book of Ruth, probably written at about the same time. [...] Today, in some situations, it may be faithful to follow Ezra, while in most situations it is faithful to follow Ruth.\\" This struggle has some members concerned that the church may not continue its relationship with the larger Anglican Church. Others, however, view this pluralism as an asset, allowing a place for both sides to balance each other. Comedian and Episcopalian Robin Williams once described the Episcopal faith (and, in a performance in London, specifically the Church of England) as \\"Catholic Lite – same rituals, half the guilt\\".Robin Williams: Live on Broadway ===Social positions=== Economic issues In 1991, the church's general convention recommended parity in pay and benefits between clergy and lay employees in equivalent positions.General Convention Resolution 1991-D066 Support a Policy of Pay Equity in the Church and Society Several times between 1979 and 2003, the convention expressed concern over affordable housing and supported work to provide affordable housing.General Convention Resolution 2003-D040 Reaffirm Commitment to Provide Affordable Housing for the Poor In 1982 and 1997, the convention reaffirmed the church's commitment to eradicating poverty and malnutrition, and challenged parishes to increase ministries to the poor.General Convention Resolution 1997-D030 Challenge Congregations to Establish Direct Ministries to the Poor The convention urged the church in 1997 and 2000 to promote living wages for all.General Convention Resolution 1997-D082 Urge Church-wide Promotion of the Living WageGeneral Convention Resolution 2000-A081 Urge Bishops and Diocesan Leaders to Support the National Implementation of a Just Wage In 2003, the convention urged U.S. legislators to raise the national minimum wage, and to establish a living wage with health benefits as the national standard.General Convention Resolution 2003-A130 Support the Establishment of a Living WageGeneral Convention Resolution 2003-C030 Urge Legislation to Raise the Federal Minimum Wage Marriage of same-sex couples At its 2015 triennial general convention, the church adopted \\"canonical and liturgical changes to provide marriage equality for Episcopalians\\". The canonical change eliminated \\"language defining marriage as between a man and a woman\\". The \\"two new marriage rites\\" contain language that allows \\"them to be used by same-sex or opposite-sex couples\\". The blessing of same-sex relationships is not uniform throughout the Episcopal Church. Following the 2015 general convention, bishops were able to determine whether churches and priests within their dioceses were permitted to use the new liturgies. Bishops who did not permit their use were to connect same-sex couples to a diocese where the liturgies were allowed. However, following the 2018 general convention, resolution B012 was amended to \\"make provision for all couples asking to be married in this church to have access to these liturgies\\". This effectively granted all churches and clergy, with or without the support of their bishop, the ability to perform same-sex marriages. The church also opposes any state or federal constitutional amendments designed to prohibit the marriages of same-sex couples.\\"Religious Groups' Official Positions on Same-Sex Marriage\\". Pew Research Center. December 7, 2012. Accessed October 28, 2014.  Ordination of LGBT identified individuals  Openly gay, lesbian, and transgender individuals are eligible to be ordained. The Episcopal Church has a nondiscrimination policy that prohibits discrimination on the basis of \\"gender identity and expression\\". Racial equality In 1861, John Henry Hopkins' wrote a pamphlet entitled, A Scriptural, Ecclesiastical, and Historical View of Slavery, attempting to justify slavery from the New Testament: the pamphlet gives a clear insight into the Episcopal Church's involvement in slavery. Bishop Hopkins' Letter on Slavery Ripped Up and his Misuse of the Sacred Scriptures Exposed, written by G.W. Hyer in 1863, opposed the points mentioned in Hopkins' pamphlet and revealed a startling divide in the Episcopal Church over the issue of slavery.G.W. Hyer, Bishop Hopkins' Letter on Slavery Ripped up and His Misuse of the Sacred Scriptures Exposed by a Clergyman of the Protestant Episcopal Church (New York: John F. Trow, 1863). In 1991, the General Convention declared \\"the practice of racism is sin,\\" and in 2006, a unanimous House of Bishops endorsed Resolution A123 apologizing for complicity in the institution of slavery, and silence over \\"Jim Crow\\" laws, segregation, and racial discrimination. In 2018, following the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Presiding Bishop Michael B. Curry said that \\"the stain of bigotry has once again covered our land\\" and called on Episcopalians to choose \\"organized love intent on creating God's beloved community on Earth\\" rather than hate. Abortion  The church is totally opposed to the use of abortion as a means of birth control or family planning, but considers it a woman's right to receive one.\\"Religious Groups' Official Positions on Abortion\\". Pew Research Center. January 16, 2013. Accessed October 28, 2014. The Church opposes any legislation which would prevent women from obtaining abortions or information about abortions. The Episcopal Church says that abortions \\"should be used only in extreme situations\\". Euthanasia The Episcopal Church disapproves of assisted suicide and other forms of euthanasia, but does teach that it is permissible to withdraw medical treatment, such as artificial nutrition and hydration, when the burden of such treatment outweighs its benefits to an individual.\\"Religious Groups' Views on End-of-Life Issues\\". Pew Research Center. November 21, 2013. Accessed October 28, 2014. ==Agencies and programs== The Society for the Increase of the Ministry (SIM) is the only organization raising funds on a national basis for Episcopal seminarian support. SIM's founding purpose in 1857 – \\"to find suitable persons for the Episcopal ministry and aid them in acquiring a thorough education\\". SIM has awarded scholarships to qualified full-time seminary students. Episcopal Relief & Development is the international relief and development agency of the Episcopal Church of the United States. It helps to rebuild after disasters and aims to empower people by offering lasting solutions that fight poverty, hunger and disease. Episcopal Relief and Development programs focus on alleviating hunger, improving food supply, creating economic opportunities, strengthening communities, promoting health, fighting disease, responding to disasters, and rebuilding communities. There are about 60 trust funds administered by the Episcopal Church which offer scholarships to young people affiliated with the church. Qualifying considerations often relate to historical missionary work of the church among American Indians and African-Americans, as well as work in China and other foreign missions. There are special programs for both American Indians and African-Americans interested in training for the ministry. There are two historical societies of American Episcopalianism: Historical Society of the Episcopal Church or National Episcopal Historians and Archivists (NEHA). Church Publishing Incorporated (Church Publishing Inc., CPI) began as the Church Hymnal Corporation in 1918, dedicated initially to publishing a single work, The Hymnal 1918, which still remains in print. It is the official publisher for the General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States. Imprints include Church Publishing, Morehouse Publishing (independently founded in 1884) and Seabury Books (the \\"trade\\" imprint). ==Ecumenical relations== Like the other churches of the Anglican Communion, the Episcopal Church has entered into full communion with the Old Catholic Churches of the Union of Utrecht, the Philippine Independent Church, and the Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Malabar. The Episcopal Church is also in a relationship of full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Northern and Southern Provinces of the Moravian Church in America. The Episcopal Church entered into a full communion agreement with the Church of Sweden at its General Convention in Salt Lake City on June 28, 2015. The Episcopal Church maintains ecumenical dialogues with the United Methodist Church and the Moravian Church in America, and participates in pan-Anglican dialogues with the Oriental Orthodox Churches, the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, and the Roman Catholic Church. In 2006 a relation of interim Eucharistic sharing was inaugurated with the United Methodist Church, a step that may ultimately lead to full communion. Historically Anglican churches have had strong ecumenical ties with the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the Episcopal Church particularly with the Russian Orthodox Church, but relations in more recent years have been strained by the ordination of women and the ordination of Gene Robinson to the episcopate. A former relation of full communion with the Polish National Catholic Church (once a part of the Union of Utrecht) was broken off by the PNCC in 1976 over the ordination of women. The Episcopal Church was a founding member of the Consultation on Church Union and participates in its successor, Churches Uniting in Christ. The Episcopal Church is a founding member of the National Council of Churches, the World Council of Churches, and the new Christian Churches Together in the USA. Dioceses and parishes are frequently members of local ecumenical councils as well. ==See also== * Christianity in the United States * Episcopal Youth Community * Historical List of bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America * List of colleges and seminaries affiliated with the Episcopal Church * List of Episcopal bishops of the United States * List of the Episcopal cathedrals of the United States * Protestantism in the United States ==ReferencesSources=== : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : ==Further reading== * Anglican & Episcopal History—The Journal of the Historical Society of the Episcopal Church (articles, church reviews, and book reviews). * Articles on leading Episcopalians, both lay (e.g., George Washington, Franklin D.

Both parents came from musical families: Martha's father was an Army bugler and cornet player, and Richard's grandparents were church and barn-dance musicians whose descendants include Noel Paul Stookey of the folk trio Peter, Paul & Mary. Stookey spent his early childhood in the Basque village of Banca. He attended French American International School and Lowell High School in San Francisco and Lycée Hoche in Versailles, France. He began violin study at age 5 with Anna Teksler in San Francisco, continuing with Malgorzata Rouger at the École Normale de Musique de Paris, and with Daniel Kobialka of the San Francisco Symphony. As a student, he played violin and viola with the San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra and sang in the chorus of Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra. He studied music theory with Donald Galfond and took his first composition lessons from Tom Constanten of the Grateful Dead at the San Francisco Community Music Center. He attended the Cleveland Institute of Music, San Francisco City College, the University of California, Berkeley (B.A. 1992), George Benjamin's composition seminars for the Royal College of Music, and Duke University (Ph.D 2003), where he was a Mary Duke Biddle Fellow and won the Klenz Prize for Composition in his first year of graduate study. Stookey's principal composition teachers were Peter Scott Lewis, Donald Erb, Andrew Imbrie, Cindy Cox, Stephen Jaffe, and Scott Lindroth. ==Orchestral music== Stookey was first commissioned by the San Francisco Symphony at age 17. He has held composer residencies with the Hallé Orchestra, during the music directorship of Kent Nagano, and with the North Carolina Symphony from 2000-2003, a partnership that resulted in over 60 performances of eight works, including Out of the Everywhere (2003) for large orchestra. In 2006, the San Francisco Symphony commissioned, premiered and recorded The Composer is Dead (2006), a guide to the orchestra with text by Lemony Snicket. He has narrated performances of The Composer is Dead, in English as well as Spanish. He also co-authored the Spanish and French translations of Lemony Snicket's text for The Composer is Dead. In 2010, the NDR Sinfonieorchester and Christoph Eschenbach premiered Stookey's Mahlerwerk (2010) at the final concert of the centennial \\"Mahler in Hamburg\\" Festival. Stookey has a long-standing musical relationship with the San Francisco Symphony and was one of the original curators of SoundBox, for which he created YTTE (2016), his third commissioned work for the orchestra. Other orchestral works include the song cycles Zipperz (2008) and Into the Bright Lights (2009) as well as several shorter works: Big Bang (2000), Wide as Skies (2003) and GO (2012). ==Vocal and theatrical music== Stookey's earliest published composition was a contribution to the Basque-language hymnal, Meza Abestiak, a gift for the Benedictine monastery of Lazkao, where the composer lived and worked in 1990. For thy sweet love (1993) for chamber chorus and organ and other early works were published by PRB Productions before being acquired by G. Schirmer/AMP in 2015. In 2008, Manoel Felciano, Eisa Davis, and the Oakland Symphony conducted by Michael Morgan premiered Zipperz (2008) for two pop singers and orchestra, with texts by Dan Harder. In 2009, Frederica von Stade launched her farewell tour with Stookey's Into the Bright Lights (2009) for mezzo-soprano and orchestra, a setting of von Stade's own reflections on singing and aging. Zheng Cao, in her final concert appearances, substituted for von Stade in the work's U.S. premiere. Stookey created the score for John Doyle's 2010 production of Bertolt Brecht's Caucasian Chalk Circle at the American Conservatory Theater (A.C.T.) in San Francisco. His monodrama Ivonne (2012) for soprano and chamber ensemble, with texts by Jerre Dye, was commissioned by Opera Memphis as part of the Ghosts of Crosstown project and featured on Opera America's 2015 national showcase at Wolf Trap. ==Chamber music== Himself a violinist and violist, Stookey has continued to write chamber music throughout his career. Strings Magazine profiled him in 2009 as one of the \\"Next Generation of String Composers.\\" The Lindsay Quartet featured Stookey's String Quartet No. 1 (1998), dedicated to them, on their 40th anniversary tour of North America in 2004. String Quartet No. 2 – Musée Mécanique (2002) was commissioned and recorded by the Ciompi Quartet. String Quartet No. 3 – The Mezzanine (2012), inspired by Nicholson Baker's eponymous book, was commissioned by Kronos Quartet and featured at the 2015 Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music, where Stookey and Kronos were in residence together. Additional chamber works include Piano Trio No. 1 (2009) for The Lee Trio, Fling (2005) for flute and string trio (commissioned by the Left Coast Chamber Ensemble), Above the Thomas Gate (2001) for piano trio (commissioned by the Mallarmé Chamber Players), Tame Me (1995) for piano and prepared piano (commissioned by the Hallé Concerts Society), and Sonatina for Sam (1992) (see Alt, pop, dance, and Junk). Where Every Verse is Filled with Grief (2009) for solo violin, an arrangement of the second movement of Alfred Schnittke's Concerto for Choir, was commissioned by Kunst-Stoff for choreography by Yannis Adoniou. ==Alt, pop, dance, and junk== Stookey has worked often in San Francisco's experimental music scene and his work uses influences outside of classical boundaries.<> Among his early collaborators was the crossover cellist Sam Bass (of the bands Deadweight, Loop!Station and Les Claypool's Fearless Flying Frog Brigade) for whom Stookey wrote both his \\"opus 1\\" Sonatina for Sam (1992) and the song Hard Up (2011). Stookey composed and recorded the string introduction to the song Soothsayer (2007) on The Mars Volta's album The Bedlam in Goliath. In the same year, he created Junkestra (2007) for an orchestra of instruments he built from objects scavenged from the city dump, and has performed on the musical saw in this work. That work was performed in vacant warehouses and public squares before being taken up by the San Francisco Symphony and other classical presenters. Its 2010 release on Innova Recordings includes Junkestra Dance Mix (2010), also by Stookey. His composition Mahlerwerk (2011) reorders hundreds of fragments of Mahler symphonies. The work is dedicated to composer Alfred Schnittke, who coined the term polystylist to describe composers who freely combine disparate elements. Nobody Suffers Like We Do (2009), a drinking song inspired by the sounds of a convenience-store cash register, with words by Daniel Handler, was commissioned and recorded by the Harvard Din & Tonics in commemoration of their 30th anniversary season. ==Residencies, teaching, publication== During his residencies with the Hallé Orchestra and North Carolina Symphony, Stookey taught at the University of Sheffield and the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill respectively. As composer-in-residence with NPR-affiliate WUNC-FM in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, he created and hosted The Composers-in-Context Series, which included both live and broadcast performances of works by living composers in the context of their musical influences. Stookey has also been composer-in-residence at the New Hampshire Music Festival, the Walden School, the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music, and the Eastern Sierra Symphony. A retrospective of his output, commemorating his years in North Carolina, was presented by the School of Music of the University of North Carolina, Greensboro. Stookey sometimes plays the musical saw in Junkestra (2007) and the OOVE (a unique electroacoustic instrument by Oliver DiCicco) in YTTE (2016). Stookey's music is published under exclusive contract by G. Schirmer/A.M.P. (Music Sales Group) of New York and London. Some works are distributed in print by Hal Leonard Corporation. ==Recordings== {  - !Album !Role !Librettist !Soloist(s) !Ensemble/Band !Conductor !Label !Release year - Music for Strings (1992-2002) composer  Bonnie Thron, Brian Reagin, Rebekah Binford North Carolina Symphony, Ciompi Quartet William Henry Curry Albany 2005 - San Francisco Premieres composer (Fling)   Left Coast Chamber Ensemble  Chamber Music Partnership 2005 - The Bedlam in Goliath contributor (Soothsayer)  Omar Rodríguez-López, Cedric Bixler-Zavala The Mars Volta Edwin Outwater Universal/Motown 2008 - The Composer is Dead composer Lemony Snicket Lemony Snicket San Francisco Symphony Edwin Outwater Harper Collins 2009 - The Pursuit of Snappiness composer (Nobody Suffers Like We Do) Daniel Handler  Harvard Din & Tonics  Harvard Din & Tonics 2010 - Junkestra composer  David Weiss San Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra percussion section Benjamin Shwartz Innova Recordings 2010 - O Compositor està Morto composer Lemony Snicket, trans.

It is found on the coasts of the eastern Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean Sea ==Description== Porcellana platycheles is a small species of crab which may attain a length of . This species is a very small and hairy crab which has wide, flattened front claws and two long antennae. It is greenish-brown on its back while the belly is off white. It has a small abdomen which it is tucks under its carapace. The last pair of legs are highly reduced and are normally hidden making the crab appear to have only three pairs of walking legs. The body is flattened too and the legs end in sharp claws which the crabs use to grip onto the underside of the rocks they live below. Although the porcelain crabs are called crabs they are in fact more closely related to lobsters and squat lobsters, a relationship hinted at by their long antennae. ==Distribution== Porcellana platycheles is distributed from Norway to the Canary Islands and throughout the Mediterranean. In Britain it is widely distributed around all coastlines from Shetland to Scilly. ==Habitat and biology== Porcellana platycheles are found beneath rocks and boulders on rocky coasts. It is mainly found where there is mud and gravel in the mid to lower intertidal zones but is occasionally found as low as the shallow subtidal zone. It is a filter-feeding crab, using specially adapted hairs on its mouthparts to filter plankton from the water and it feeds on carrion and other organic debris. This crab needs a habitat with organic matter and has a preference for more sheltered shores, particularly where there has been material deposited among the rocks. ==References== Category:Porcelain crabs Category:Crustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Fauna of the Mediterranean Sea Category:Crustaceans described in 1777 Category:Taxa named by Thomas Pennant ","title":"Porcellana platycheles"},{"id":"19280836","text":"The Synergistetes is a recently recognized phylum of anaerobic bacteria that show Gram-negative staining and have rod/vibrioid cell shape.Hugenholtz, P., Hooper, S.D., and Kyrpides, N.C. (2009). Focus: Synergistetes. Environ. Microbiol. 11, 1327–1329. Although Synergistetes have a diderm cell envelope,Gupta, R. S.

Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek. 100: 171–182 the genes for various proteins involved in lipopolysaccharides biosynthesis have not yet been detected in Synergistetes, indicating that they may have an atypical outer cell envelope. The Synergistetes inhabit a majority of anaerobic environments including animal gastrointestinal tracts, soil, oil wells, and wastewater treatment plants and they are also present in sites of human diseases such as cysts, abscesses, and areas of periodontal disease.Vartoukian, S.R., Palmer, R.M., and Wade, W.G. (2007). The division \\"Synergistes\\". Anaerobe. 13, 99–106. Due to their presence at illness related sites, the Synergistetes are suggested to be opportunistic pathogens but they can also be found in healthy individuals in the microbiome of the umbilicus and in normal vaginal flora.Marchandin, H., Damay, A., Roudiere, L., Teyssier, C., Zorgniotti, I., Dechaud, H., Jean-Pierre, H., and Jumas-Bilak, E. (2010). Phylogeny, diversity and host specialization in the phylum Synergistetes with emphasis on strains and clones of human origin. Res. Microbiol. 161, 91–100. Species within this phylum have also been implicated in periodontal disease, gastrointestinal infections and soft tissue infections. Other species from this phylum have been identified as significant contributors in the degradation of sludge for production of biogas in anaerobic digesters and are potential candidates for use in renewable energy production through their production of hydrogen gas.Riviere, D., Desvignes, V., Pelletier, E., Chaussonnerie, S., Guermazi, S., Weissenbach, J., Li, T., Camacho, P., and Sghir, A. (2009). Towards the definition of a core of microorganisms involved in anaerobic digestion of sludge. ISME. J. 3, 700–714. All of the known Synergistetes species and genera are presently part of a single class (Synergistia), order (Synergistiales) and family (Synergistaceae). ==Comparative genomics and molecular signatures== Recent comparative analyses of sequenced Synergistetes genomes have led to identification of large numbers of conserved signature indels (CSIs) in protein sequences that are specific for either all sequenced Synergistetes species or some of their sub-clades that are observed in phylogenetic trees. Of the CSIs that were identified, 32 in widely distributed proteins such as RpoB, RpoC, UvrD, GyrA, PolA, PolC, MraW, NadD, PyrE, RpsA, RpsH, FtsA, RadA, etc., including a large >300 aa insert in the RpoC protein, are present in various Synergistetes species, but except for isolated bacteria, these CSIs are not found in the protein homologues from all other organisms. These CSIs provide novel molecular markers for distinguishing Synergistetes species from all other bacteria. Seven other CSIs in important proteins including a 13 aa in RpoB were found to be uniquely present in Jonquetella, Pyramidobacter and Dethiosulfovibrio species indicating a close and specific relationship among these bacteria, which is also strongly supported by phylogenetic trees. Fifteen addition CSIs that were only present in Jonquetella and Pyramidobacter indicate a close association between these two species. Lastly, a close relationship between the Aminomonas and Thermanaerovibrio species is also supported by 9 identified CSIs. The identified molecular markers provide reliable means for the division of species from the phylum Synergistetes into intermediate taxonomic ranks such as families and orders. == Phylogeny== The phylogeny based on the work of the All-Species Living Tree Project. ==Taxonomy== The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LSPN) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). * Subphylum Synergistetes Jumas-Bilak et al. 2009 [Synergistaeota Oren et al. 2015 [Aminanaerobia Hugenholtz] ** Class Synergistia Jumas-Bilak et al. 2009 *** Order Synergistales Jumas-Bilak et al. 2009 **** Family Synergistaceae Jumas-Bilak et al. 2009 [Clostridiales Family XV] ***** Genus Acetomicrobium Soutschek et al. 1985 ****** Species Acetomicrobium flavidum Soutschek et al. 1985 ***** Genus Aminiphilus Díaz et al. 2007 ****** Species Aminiphilus circumscriptus Díaz et al. 2007 ***** Genus Aminivibrio Honda et al. 2013 ****** Species Aminivibrio pyruvatiphilus Honda et al. 2013 ***** Genus Aminobacterium Baena et al. 1999 ****** Species A. colombiense Baena et al. 1999 (type sp.) ****** Species A. mobile Baena et al. 2000 ****** Species A. thunnarium Hamdi et al. 2015 ***** Genus Aminomonas Baena et al. 1999 ****** Species Aminomonas paucivorans Baena et al. 1999 ***** Genus Anaerobaculum Rees et al. 1997 emend.

(2009) Dragonflies of the North Woods, Second Edition, Duluth, MN:Kollath+Stensaas Publ. p.152-153. ==DietNaiad=== Naiads feed on a wide variety of aquatic insects, such as mosquito larvae, other aquatic fly larvae, mayfly larvae, and freshwater shrimp. They will also eat very small fish and tadpoles. ===Adult=== The dragonfly will eat almost any soft-bodied flying insect including mosquitoes, flies, small moths, mayflies, and flying ants or termites. ==Ecology== The naiads live in the debris of the bottoms of lakes and ponds. They do not actively pursue prey but wait for it to pass by, a strategy which affords them protection from other predators. The naiads emerge, or make the transition to adult dragonflies, at night. Adults fly from early August through October. This species flies later in the fall than any other species in the Northwest, with observations as late as October 29 in Idaho, and into November in Washington. The adults of this species hunt flying insects from perches on rocks or bare branches. The Latin name for this genus, Sympetrum, means \\"with rock\\" and refers to their habit of basking on rocks to absorb heat early in the day. This dragonfly is extremely abundant where it occurs, with large numbers of pairs flying and laying eggs in tandem. ==Reproduction== Tandem position, male in front The female flies with the male still attached after mating (a position called \\"in tandem\\") and lays her eggs near the shoreline of lakes and ponds by dipping the tip of her abdomen on the surface of the water. Large-mouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) have been observed following mated pairs of dragonflies as they fly just above the surface, and then eating them as they touch the surface to lay eggs. ==Conservation== Populations are widespread, abundant, and secure. ==References== * *Sympetrum vicinum, Idaho Museum of Natural History * * *Logan, E.

Early stages of the competition were run in three regions (northern, central, and southern), with the National League teams receiving a bye until the Fourth Round of the competition. In all, 144 teams took part in the competition. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article. ==ResultsThird Round=== * Won on penalties by Metro (3-2), Nelson Suburbs (3-2), and Porirua United (4-2) ===Fourth Round=== * Won on penalties by Nelson Suburbs (4-3). † Replayed match after Courier Rangers fielded ineligible player ===Fifth Round=Sixth Round=Semi- finals=The Final== The final was held outside one of the main centres for the first time, being played in Nelson. Manurewa won the competition for the first time since 1931, when they had played under the name \\"Tramurewa\\" (after a recent merger with Tramways FC). The gap of 47 years between trophies in this competition is still a record. Manurewa's side was coached by John Adshead who four years later would steer New Zealand's national side to their first FIFA World Cup. The team included several top players, notably Dave Bright and goalkeeper Frank van Hattum; they were opposed by the previous year's champions, Nelson United, a team which boasted the presence of Kenny Cresswell, Peter Simonsen and Keith Mackay, among others. The game's only goal came after 12 minutes. Nelson keeper Owen Nuttridge failed to completely clear a Dave Bright cross, only for the ball to be headed into the net by Bruce Foster. p. 78 ===Final=References== *Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation New Zealand 1978 page *UltimateNZSoccer website 1978 Chatham Cup page Category:Chatham Cup Chatham Cup Chatham Cup Category:September 1978 sports events in Oceania ","title":"1978 Chatham Cup"},{"id":"19281110","text":"Edward O'Neill, O'Neil or O'Neal may refer to: ==Politicians== *Edward O'Neill, 2nd Baron O'Neill (1839–1928), Irish peer and Conservative politician *Edward O'Neill (Wisconsin politician) (1820–1890), Mayor of Milwaukee, Wisconsin *Edward J.

They have released five albums: Vivarium, Free, Great Divide, GLA and Power. Their highest charting singles are \\"Heart and Soul\\" and \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" from Great Divide released in 2015. On 2 June 2016 Annie Mac premiered \\"No Sleep\\" as the Hottest Record in the World on BBC Radio 1 and announced their new album GLA, subsequently released on 9 September 2016. ==HistoryFormation, A Guidance from Colour (2006–08)=== Twin Atlantic formed in 2006. All members previously played in other small local bands. During 2007 they built up a strong reputation both locally and nationally. Twin Atlantic supported Circa Survive and mewithoutYou before recording their debut EP A Guidance from Colour at Long Wave Studio in Cardiff with producer Romesh Dodangoda (Funeral for a Friend, Kids in Glass Houses, The Blackout). This culminated in the release of their first single, \\"Audience & Audio\\", on 24 December 2007 and debut EP on 14 January 2008. Building on support from Kerrang! and a loyal fan base, the band's profile was boosted enough for them to land support slots with Biffy Clyro and they were personally chosen by Jimmy Chamberlin to support Smashing Pumpkins at Glasgow's SECC in early February. Over the following months, they also supported American acts The Matches, Finch and Say Anything on their respective UK tours. In mid-2008, Twin Atlantic played many festivals in Scotland, including T in the Park, Belladrum Festival, Wickerman Festival, RockNess, Live at Loch Lomond and Connect Music Festival. The band signed a single deal with King Tut's Recordings, and \\"What Is Light? Where Is Laughter?\\" was released on 29 September 2008. They also completed a joint headline tour of Scotland with The Xcerts and their first set of solo headline dates across the UK. ===Vivarium (2009–10)=== In March 2009, Twin Atlantic released their debut mini-album, Vivarium. They released the lead single \\"Lightspeed\\" as a free download from their website on 29 July 2009, with a bonus acoustic version of the track also available.

On 7 March 2009, they played a sold-out gig at Queen Margaret Union (QMU). The band toured extensively in 2009 and 2010, having played Download Festival, Guilfest, T in the Park, Sonisphere and Belladrum over the summer of 2009, including supporting Taking Back Sunday on a tour of the UK and Ireland in July 2009. This continued into a full tour of the UK in September and then the United States with The Fall of Troy and Envy On The Coast in March and April 2010. In June 2010, Twin Atlantic supported The Gaslight Anthem on their British mini-tour and on 7 August 2010 they played at the Hevy Music Festival. Twin Atlantic played at the sold-out Belsonic festival in Belfast on 28 August 2010 supporting Biffy Clyro. Following a sold-out show at Glasgow's ABC, they landed the dream slot of supporting Blink-182 on their reunion tour in Scotland in August 2010. On 21 October 2010, the band announced, that they would be supporting My Chemical Romance for three upcoming dates. ===Free (2011–13)=== Twin Atlantic finished recording their album Free and it was released on 29 April 2011 in the Republic of Ireland and 2 May 2011 in the United Kingdom. The album's first single was \\"Edit Me\\", released on 14 February. Second single \\"Free\\" was first played on BBC Radio 1 on the Zane Lowe show on 10 March. The third single released was \\"Time For You To Stand Up\\" on 11 July, with \\"Cherry Slut\\" and \\"Babylonian Throwdown\\" as B-sides. On 26 September, a fourth single was released from the album; \\"Make A Beast Of Myself\\", including the B-side \\"Your Amazing Lying, Lion, Lie In\\". In the summer of 2012, the band was on the Vans Warped Tour. Twin Atlantic also supported Blink-182 again in some venues on their UK tour alongside The All- American Rejects. A remix of their single, \\"Free\\", was used for the closing of the Discovery Channel's coverage of the 2012 Red Bull Stratos space jump by Felix Baumgartner. Their song \\"Crash Land\\" was featured in the British film Not Another Happy Ending in 2013. ===Great Divide (2014–15)=== Twin Atlantic released their album Great Divide in August 2014. In February 2014, Twin Atlantic joined Thirty Seconds to Mars on the second part of their European Arena tour. On 31 March 2014 Zane Lowe premiered \\"Heart and Soul\\" as the Hottest Record in the World on BBC Radio 1. The track won the award for 'Best Independent Track' at the 2014 Association of Independent Music Awards. On 23 April 2014 the band's third studio album Great Divide was announced, with a release date of 18 August 2014. Twin Atlantic did a four date tour in support of the album, playing Brixton Academy in London and they sold out their hometown show at Glasgow's SSE Hydro. During the summer of 2015, the band performed at several festivals including Glastonbury Festival and T in the Park festival at the new site at Strathallan Castle. The band headlined the BBC Radio 1 Stage on Saturday at T in the Park 2015. They concluded their album campaign at Reading and Leeds Festival in August 2015. The last single from the album campaign was \\"Fall Into The Party\\", the official video included highlights of the previous 18 months promoting the album at several gigs, festivals, and their massive headline show at The SSE Hydro. The band were nominated as finalists for Best Live Act 2015 by the Association of Independent Music. Twin Atlantic were named 'Best UK Band' at the 2016 SSE Scottish Music Awards. ===GLA (2016–present)=== Twin Atlantic released their fourth studio album, GLA, on 9 September 2016. New tracks from the album \\"Gold Elephant: Cherry Alligator\\" and \\"No Sleep\\" were released on 3 June. Annie Mac premiered \\"No Sleep\\" as the Hottest Record in the World on BBC Radio 1. On 7 July 2016, Zane Lowe premiered the track \\"Ex El\\" on his Beats 1 radio show. The second single from the album \\"The Chaser\\" was then premiered by Annie Mac on Thursday 18 August 2016 on BBC Radio 1. They gave fans the opportunity to be involved in the music video, which was shot in Buff Club in Glasgow, the club where they played their first gig together. The album was produced by Jacknife Lee in Los Angeles. GLA is the airport code for the band's hometown, Glasgow. They made their BBC national TV debut on Later... with Jools Holland on 4 October 2016 performing three songs \\"No Sleep\\", \\"The Chaser\\" and \\"Ex El\\". They then embarked on several tours in support of the album, taking them around the UK and Europe, including a run of three nights at the renowned Barrowland Ballroom in their native Glasgow. Twin Atlantic were writing new music, which they hoped to release shortly thereafter. ===Power (2020)=== Twin Atlantic announced their fifth studio album titled, Power, whilst releasing their first single titled \\"Novocaine\\". In a Kerrang! interview speaking of the band's first new music since 2016's GLA, frontman Sam McTrusty says of Novocaine: “I wanted to force myself to be more honest and open. The song tells the story of the most intimate connection I’ve ever felt with someone else: when I first met my wife. That feeling of obsession taking over every thought and reason was almost like an addiction at the time. It embarrasses us in some ways that we fell victim to such a clichéd movie script love story, but equally amazes us that it ever happened.” They have a UK intimate tour lined up for 2020 with the album releasing on 24 January 2020. == Members == *Sam McTrusty – lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Ross McNae – bass, keyboards, backing vocals *Craig Kneale – drums, percussion, backing vocals *Barry McKenna – lead guitar, cello, keyboards, backing vocals. As of 2019, McKenna is a touring member, but no longer involved off stage. == Discography Studio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text- align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:13em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:17em;\\" Details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"6\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:11em;\\" Certifications - !style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%\\"SCO Peak chart position on the Scottish Albums Chart: * Vivarium: * Free: * Great Divide: * GLA: * Power: ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\\" BEL (WA) !style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%\\"IRL !style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%\\"UK !style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%\\" UK Indie Peak chart position on the UK Indie Albums Chart: * Vivarium: * Free: * Great Divide: * GLA: !style=\\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%\\"UK Rock Peak chart position on the UK Rock Albums Chart: * Free: * Great Divide: * GLA: - ! scope=\\"row\\" Vivarium  *Released: 14 September 2009 *Label: Red Bull Records *Formats: CD, digital download  28  —  —  148  21  —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Free  *Released: 29 April 2011 *Label: Red Bull Records *Formats: CD, digital download  4  —  —  37  5  1  *BPI: Silver - ! scope=\\"row\\" Great Divide  *Released: 18 August 2014 *Label: Red Bull Records *Formats: CD, digital download  1  —  77  6  2  1  - ! scope=\\"row\\" GLA  *Released: 9 September 2016 *Label: Red Bull Records *Formats: CD, digital download  3  167  —  9  2  1  - ! scope=\\"row\\" Power  *Released: 24 January 2020 *Label: Virgin EMI Records *Formats: CD, Vinyl, digital download  1  —  —  11  —  —  - colspan=\\"9\\" style=\\"font- size:90%\\" \\"—\\" denotes a title that did not chart. } ===EPs=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" colwspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:10em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:17em;\\" Album details - ! scope=\\"row\\" A Guidance from Colour  * Released: 14 January 2008 * Label: Staple Diet Records * Formats: CD, DL - ! scope=\\"row\\" Finch + Twin Atlantic Split EP  * Released: 2009 * Label: Red Bull Records * Formats: CD, DL - } ===Singles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\"  - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"7\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:15em;\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.5em;font- size:90%;\\" SCO Peak chart position on the Scottish Singles Chart: * What Is Light?

Meleke (, \\"royal\\", \\"kingly\\"; ), also transliterated melekeh or malaki, is a lithologic type of white, coarsely- crystalline, thickly bedded-limestone found in the Judean Hills in Israel and the West Bank.Shadmon, Asher (1972), Stone in Israel, Jerusalem: Natural Resources Research Organization, Ministry of Development, State of Israel, p. 30. It has been used in the traditional architecture of Jerusalem since ancient times, especially in Herodian architecture. Though it is often popularly referred to as Jerusalem stone, that phrase can refer to a number of different types of stone found and used in or associated with Jerusalem. ==Name== Meleke is an Arabic word that originated in the jargon of local stonemasons. Translated as \\"kingly stone\\", (or \\"queenly\\"), \\"royal stone\\", or \\"stone of kings\\", the source of the word's meaning may derive from Jerusalem Stone's use in all the monumental tombs of Jerusalem.BAS Archive Israeli building stone authority Asher Shadmon cites the word as one of the local or colloquial \\"mason's terms\\" that have been \\"adopted by geologists\\" and are applied in the technical literature.Shadmon, Op. cit., pg 21. (In his 1972 book, Shadmon advanced \\"King Solomon Stone\\" as a proposed commercial name for meleke, but this apparently did not catch on.) ==Description== Meleke is quarried from the Upper Turonian Stage of the Bina (Baana) Formation of Late Cretaceous age, a layer about 10 meters in thickness and about 90 million years old. When freshly cut, it is a pure white limestone. It may retain its white color for many years or it may be insolated to a light golden yellow. The aged stone has a typical golden hue, but may range in tone from pinkish to off-white. When quarried it is soft and quite workable, but upon exposure it hardens and develops a clear surface that will take on a high polish. Meleke withstands natural erosion very well and provides a high-quality building stone, as well as commercial marble. ==History== Stonemasons in Jerusalem (Old postcard). Used as a building material since ancient times, this \\"royal stone\\" has been of great importance to the history of the city of Jerusalem. When it is first exposed to the air it can be soft enough to be cut with a knife, but exposed to the air it hardens to make a stone of considerable durability, useful for building. Hundreds of caverns, cisterns, tombs and aqueducts in Jerusalem have been excavated from this stone.Entry, “Jerusalem”, The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (1994), 4 volumes, Hendrickson Publishers According to a long-standing legend, \\"Zedekiah's Cave\\", a large ancient meleke cave/quarry near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem's Old City, was the source of the building material for Solomon's First Temple.Friedman, Thomas L., “Quarrying History in Jerusalem, The New York Times, 1 December 1985 Richard S. Barnett writes that ashlars in the Western Wall and the outer retaining wall of the extended Herodian Temple platform were apparently cut from meleke quarries near Bezetha. The courtyard of the Tomb of Helena of Adiabene was originally a meleke stone quarry, and the staircase once a ramp upon which the blocks extracted were hauled. Of the four types of limestone found in the Jerusalem region, two were used in building during the Islamic period in Palestine: meleke and mizzi, the latter being a harder stone, also known as \\"Palestinian marble\\". The use of Jerusalem Stone was popular among the Frankish stonemasons of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem in Palestine, who quarried it to make fine, carefully drafted building stones for use in door and window features, among other architectural features.Boas. 2001, p. 5. Frankish markings from the distinctive diagonal tools used by their stonemasons can be seen on meleke stones put to secondary use in the walls surrounding the Old City of Jerusalem. ==In archaeological excavations== Meleke in the Gerofit Formation (Turonian) near Makhtesh Ramon, southern Israel. High quality, meleke limestone has been found wherever excavations in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre have reached bedrock. Beginning in about the seventh or eighth century BCE, the area where the church is now located was a large quarry, with the city of Jerusalem lying to the southeast. Traces of the quarry have been found not only in the church area, but also in excavations conducted nearby in the 1960s and 1970s by Kathleen Kenyon in the Muristan enclave of Jerusalem's Christian Quarter, and by Ute Lux, in the nearby Church of the Redeemer. Meleke stone was chiseled out in squarish blocks and partially cut ashlars still attached to the bedrock after being left by the workers were found. East of St. Helena's Chapel in the Holy Sepulchre Church, the quarry was over 40 feet deep and the earth and ash therein contained Iron Age II pottery, from about the seventh century BCE. According to Virgilio C. Corbo, professor of archaeology at the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum in Jerusalem, the quarry continued to be used until the first century BCE, at which time it was filled, and covered with a layer of reddish-brown soil mixed with stone flakes from the ancient quarry. It became a garden or orchard, where cereals, fig, carob, and olive trees were grown. It also served as a cemetery, and at least four tombs dating from this period have been found, including a typical kokh tomb thought to be that of Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea. A salvage excavation conducted by the Israeli Antiquities Authority in June 2006 in the Sanhedriya neighborhood of Jerusalem exposed another ancient masonry meleke quarry. Larger than the area excavated, the quarry abutted onto the southern end of the Second Temple-period Tombs of the Sanhedrin, between which extensive ancient quarries had previously been discovered. The quarry seems to have been in operation in the Roman period, though precise dating was difficult because the quarrying debris was devoid of coins and potsherds, and modern debris had entered the site. A few pottery fragments from the end of the first century BCE to the first century CE found on the bottom of the quarry units formed the basis for the dating put forward, and the quarry's proximity to the Sanhedrin tombs of the Second Temple period has also led archaeologists to assume it was in use during that time. The exposed quarry is just one of a number of ancient quarries discovered in the Sanhedriya-Mahanayim region whose stones were utilized in the public construction of Jerusalem. ==See also== *List of types of limestone *Jerusalem stone *Limepit ==References== Category:Limestone *Meleke Category:Building stone Category:Geology of Israel de:Meleke fr:Pierre de Jérusalem (calcaire) he:אבן ירושלמית ","title":"Meleke"},{"id":"19281170","text":"Mr. Moto's Last Warning is the sixth in a series of eight films starring Peter Lorre as Mr. Moto. The film is an original story featuring the character created by John P. Marquand. ==Plot== The British Navy in Port Said is making plans for naval manoeuvres with the French fleet. Plans are delayed because the British Secret Service has been warned of possible sabotage. On a ship docking in Port Said is Madame Delacour (Margaret Irving), wife of the French naval admiral. Delacour and her daughter Marie (Joan Carroll) are befriended by the charming Eric Norvel (George Sanders), the goofy Rollo Venables (Robert Coote), and someone posing as Mr. Moto (Teru Shimada). Norvel reveals his true nature when the ship docks and he lures Mr. Moto to his death. This \\"fake\\" Mr. Moto turns out to be a fellow agent of Mr. Moto (Peter Lorre) who is posing as a curio dealer Mr. Kuroki. Norvel takes Delacour and Venables to a variety show featuring Fabian the Great (Ricardo Cortez), a ventriloquist. Fabian is the leader of the gang of saboteurs including Hakim (John Davidson), Captain Hawkins (Leyland Hodgson), Danforth (John Carradine), and Norvel. Danforth is actually a British Secret Service agent named Burke. Moto listens in on their conversation and is almost captured, but Burke helps him escape. Norvel is given the task of learning from Delacour when the French fleet is due at Port Said. The suspicious Fabian thinks that Kuroki may actually be Mr. Moto. Fabian enlists his girlfriend Connie (Virginia Field), who is unaware he is an agent, to follow Mr. Moto the next day. She sees Moto visit the Port Commandant's office where he learns of the salvage ship \\"The Vulcan\\" captained by Hawkins. Fabian also discovers that Danforth is the secret agent, Burke. Fabian lures Burke to \\"The Vulcan\\" and reveals his plan to blow up the French fleet and blame the British. He then kills Burke by trapping him in a diving bell. Norvel gets the information needed and tells Fabian at the theater. Connie overhears the conversation and threatens to call the Port Commandant, but Fabian convinces her to go along with him. Hakim tries to kill Moto with a bomb, but Moto escapes the explosion and follows Hakim to a warehouse. Moto enlists Venables to help, but Venables is tricked by Norvel. After a fight, Moto and Venables are tied in sacks and thrown into the ocean, but not before Moto tricks Hawkins and grabs a piece of sharp metal. Connie can't bear to see this violence and goes to call the police. Fabian knocks her out and proceeds with his plans. Moto escapes underwater and frees Venables, who goes to the police. Norvel dives down to await a signal from Fabian but Moto overpowers him and prematurely detonates the explosives meant to destroy the French fleet. Resurfacing, Moto fights with Fabian but Connie shows up and shoots Fabian.

It is available at the Internet Archive.Internet Archive page for Mr. Moto's Last Warning The film was announced in April 1938. The title was then changed to Mr. Moto in Egypt before it eventually became Mr Moto's Last Warning. In April, the studio announced they were considering giving a lead role to Al Jolson, who was making Rose of Washington Square for the studio. This role eventually went to Ricardo Cortez. The previous Moto film, Mysterious Mr. Moto, had finished shooting in April 1938. Filming on this one started in June 1938. Virginia Field also appeared in the first film of the series, Think Fast, Mr. Moto. John Carradine had previously appeared in Thank You, Mr. Moto. Carradine's part was to have been played by Miles Mander but he was delayed by retakes on Suez and had to be replaced. While filming a fight scene on the film, stunt man Harvey Perry was knocked out for five minutes. When Ricardo Cortez made the film he announced he was retiring from acting and had signed to Fox as a director. ==Reception== The film was released in January 1939. The New York Times thought the \\"method\\" used by Moto was \\"a little tough on the audience\\" but praised the \\"rousing old fashioned climax\\". The Los Angeles Times gave the film \\"faint praise\\" saying it was \\"routine\\". ==Home media== This film, along with Mr. Moto in Danger Island, Mr. Moto's Gamble, Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation and (as a DVD extra) The Return of Mr. Moto, was released on DVD in 2007 by 20th Century Fox as part of The Mr. Moto Collection, Volume Two. ==See also== *Think Fast, Mr. Moto *Thank You, Mr. Moto *Mr. Moto's Gamble *Mr. Moto Takes a Chance *Mysterious Mr. Moto *Mr. Moto in Danger Island *Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation *The Return of Mr. Moto ==Further reading== * * ==References* * *Complete film at Internet Archive Category:1939 films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American mystery films Category:Films directed by Norman Foster Category:20th Century Fox films Category:1939 mystery films ","title":"Mr. Moto's Last Warning"},{"id":"19281233","text":"Leonard Paul Blair (born April 12, 1949) is an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church serving as the thirteenth bishop and fifth and current archbishop of the Archdiocese of Hartford, Connecticut. He was installed as the Archbishop of Hartford on December 16, 2013. ==Biography== Leonard Blair was born in Detroit, Michigan, and there studied at Sacred Heart Seminary, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in History. He then furthered his studies in Rome, where he earned a baccalaureate and licentiate in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University, and a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum). Blair was ordained to the priesthood on June 26, 1976, and then served as vicar general and chancellor of the Archdiocese of Detroit. He taught theology at Sacred Heart Seminary, where he was dean of studies as well. Blair was personal secretary to Edmund Cardinal Szoka and an official of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See from 1994-97, whence he was named pastor of St. Paul Church in Grosse Point Farms, Michigan. ===Auxiliary Bishop of Detroit=== On July 8, 1999, Blair was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Detroit and Titular Bishop of Voncariana. He received his episcopal consecration on the following August 24 from Adam Cardinal Maida, with Cardinal Szoka and Bishop Dale Melczek serving as co-consecrators. ===Bishop of Toledo=== Blair was later appointed Bishop of Toledo, Ohio, on October 7, 2003. He was installed on December 4, 2003. In July 2011, Blair advised parishes and Catholic schools in the Diocese of Toledo against raising funds for the Susan G. Komen Foundation, citing concerns that funds contributed to the global anti-cancer foundation may go towards funding embryonic stem-cell research. Blair stated, \\"As best we can determine, at present the Komen Foundation does not fund cancer research that employs embryonic stem cells. However, their policy does not exclude that possibility. They are open to embryonic stem cell research, and may very well fund such research in the future.\\" Blair's statement also made reference to Komen's relationship with Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of abortions in the United States of America. Because of these factors, Bishop Blair, in conjunction with the Catholic bishops of Ohio, urged Catholic faithful, both corporate and individually, to consider alternate organizations when supporting anti-breast cancer research. ===Archbishop of Hartford=== Blair was appointed as the fifth Archbishop of Hartford on October 29, 2013 and installed on December 16, 2013. ==See also== * Catholic Church hierarchy * Catholic Church in the United States * Historical list of the Catholic bishops of the United States * List of Catholic bishops of the United States * Lists of patriarchs, archbishops, and bishops ==References *Catholic-Hierarchy *Diocese of Toledo *Leonard P.

The genus is based on a single specimen collected in 1986 by a team led by paleontologist William H. Hammer of Augustana College, and now housed in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH 24419). The holotype consists of an incomplete snout, including portions of both the right and left premaxilla, a partial left maxilla, both lacrimals, a small portion of the left nasal, the vomer, and a fragment of the palatine. Many partial teeth are preserved, though most have been broken away at their bases. The preserved part of the skull measures 27 cm long and 21 cm wide, from which a total skull length on about one meter has been inferred (Sidor et al., 2008; p. 657). Total body length has been estimated at 4.57 meters. The specimen suffered some damage during excavation, and the ventral surface is better preserved than the dorsal side of the fossil. Presently, only a single species is recognized, K. colllinsoni, named in honor of Antarctic scientist Jim Collinson. Kryostega was discovered in beds of the upper Fremouw Formation at Gordon Valley in the central Transantarctic Mountains. This portion of the Fremouw Formation consists largely of a 300-meter thick series of crossbedded, volcaniclastic sandstones. Kryostega was found in a thin siltstone cobble conglomerate within these strata, about 70 meters from the base of the upper member. The same bed has produced remains of Cynognathus, along with a kannemeyeriid dicynodont, a gomphodont cynodont, and a second species of large temnospondyl. Sidor et al. (2008; p. 661-662) conclude that the \\"...inferred high paleolatitude of Gordon Valley during deposition would have subjected it to long periods of continuous darkness during the winter months,\\" and that the discovery of a large, semi- aquatic amphibian in these beds is \\"...evidence for unsuspected ecological diversity with the Polar Circle during the Triassic.\\" Sidor et al. (2008; p. 659-660) conclude that Kryostega likely belongs to either the families Heylerosauridae or the basal Mastodonsauridae within the Stereospondyli, though they also consider an anternative phylogeny, the possibility that it may belong, instead, in the Trematosauroidea, and suggest that only additional and more complete specimens of the taxon will resolve the issue. == References == * Sidor, C.

Atmospheric satellites remain aloft through atmospheric lift, either aerostatic/buoyancy (e.g., balloons) or aerodynamic (e.g., airplanes). By contrast, conventional satellites in Earth orbit operate in the vacuum of space and remain in flight through centrifugal force derived from their orbital speed. To date, all atmosats have been unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). ==Design principlesOverview=== An atmosat remains aloft through atmospheric lift, in contrast to a satellite in Earth orbit which moves freely at high speed in the vacuum of space, and orbits due to its centrifugal force matching the force of gravity. Satellites are expensive to build and launch, and any changes to their orbit requires expending their extremely limited fuel supply. Atmospheric satellites fly much slower and are intended to provide a range of services more economically and with more versatility than current low Earth orbit satellites. Operating altitudes are expected to be in the tropopause—at approximately 65,000 feet—where winds are generally less than 5 knots and clouds do not block sunlight. It is desirable in the United States to operate above 60,000 feet, above which the Federal Aviation Administration does not regulate the airspace. There are two classes of atmosat, respectively gaining their lift through either aerostatic (e.g., balloons) or aerodynamic (e.g., airplanes) forces. In order to remain aloft for long periods, the NASA and Titan Aerospace designs use propeller-driven electric airplanes powered by solar cells, in contrast to Google's Project Loon which envisions using helium-filled high-altitude balloons. ===Airplanes=== NASA Centurion To enable night time operation and ensure endurance through consecutive 24-hour day/night cycles, in daylight hours solar panels charge batteries or fuel cells which subsequently power the vehicle during hours of darkness. An atmospheric satellite may initially ascend at night under battery power, and reach altitude soon after dawn to allow solar panels to take advantage of a full day's sunlight. Facebook's UAV-based Aquila system expects to use laser communication technology to provide Internet communication among UAVs, and also between UAVs and ground stations that in turn will connect to rural areas. The Aquila UAV is a carbon fiber, solar-powered flying wing design about the size of a passenger jet. ● Aquila's first test flight took place on June 28, 2016. It flew for ninety minutes, reaching a maximum altitude of 2150 feet, and was substantially damaged when a twenty-foot section of the righthand wing broke off during final approach to landing. The Aquila is designed and manufactured by the UK company Ascenta.Rory Cellan-Jones; Facebook's drones - made in Britain, BBC, 21 July 2016. (Retrieved 24 July 2016). Luminati Aerospace claims its Substrata solar-powered aircraft could remain aloft indefinitely up to a latitude of 50° through formation flight like migratory geese, reducing by 79% the power required for the trailing aircraft and allowing smaller airframes. ===Balloons=== A Google Project Loon balloon A geostationary balloon satellite (GBS) flies in the stratosphere ( above sea level) at a fixed point over the Earth's surface. At that altitude the air has 1/10 of its density is at sea level. The average wind speed at these altitudes is less than that at the surface. A GBS could be used to provide broadband Internet access over a large area. One current project is the Google's Project Loon, which envisions using helium-filled high-altitude balloons. ==Applications== Proposed applications for atmosats include border security, maritime traffic monitoring, anti-piracy operations, disaster response, agricultural observation, atmospheric observation, weather monitoring, communications relay, oceanographic research, Earth imaging and telecommunications. Facebook is reportedly envisioning providing Internet access to the African continent with a fleet of 11,000 vehicles. ==High- Altitude Long Endurance== High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) is the description of an air-borne vehicle which functions optimally at high-altitude (as high as 60,000 feet) and is capable of flights which last for considerable periods of time without recourse to landing.

Radio Stations and Systems – Article 1.66A, definition: high altitude platform station – defined as \\"a station on an object at an altitude of 20 to 50 km and at a specified, nominal, fixed point relative to the Earth\\". Each station shall be classified by the service in which it operates permanently or temporarily. ;See also: ===Design considerations=== Limitation due to power A HAP can be a manned or unmanned airplane, a balloon, or an airship. All require electrical power to keep themselves and their payload functional. While current HAPS are powered by batteries or engines, mission time is limited by the need for recharging/refueling. Therefore, alternative means are being considered for the future. Solar cells are one of the best options currently being used under trial for HAPS (Helios, Lindstrand HALE). Altitude selection for HAPS Wind Profile variation with Altitude showing minimum wind speeds between 17 and 22 km altitude. (Although the absolute value of the wind speed will vary with Altitude, the trends (shown in these figures) are similar for most locations.) Source. NASA Whether an airship or an aeroplane, a major challenge is the ability of the HAP to maintain stationkeeping in the face of winds. An operating altitude between 17 and 22 km is chosen because in most regions of the world this represents a layer of relatively mild wind and turbulence above the jet stream. Although the wind profile may vary considerably with latitude and with season, a form similar to that shown will usually obtain. This altitude (> 17 km) is also above commercial air-traffic heights, which would otherwise prove a potentially prohibitive constraint.High-altitude platforms for wireless communications by T. C. Tozer and D. Grace, Electronics & Communication Engineering Journal, June 2001 ===Comparison to satellites=== Since HAPS operate at much lower altitudes than satellites, it is possible to cover a small region much more effectively. Lower altitude also means much lower telecommunications link budget (hence lower power consumption) and smaller round-trip delay compared to satellites. Furthermore, deploying a satellite requires significant time and monetary resources, in terms of development and launch. HAPS, on the other hand, are comparatively less expensive and are rapidly deployable. Another major difference is that a satellite, once launched, cannot be landed for maintenance, while HAPS can. ===Applications=== Telecommunications One of the latest uses of HAPS has been for radiocommunication service. Research on HAPS is being actively carried largely in Europe, where scientists are considering them as a platform to deliver high-speed connectivity to users, over . It has gained significant interest because HAPS will be able to deliver bandwidth and capacity similar to a broadband wireless access network (such as WiMAX) while providing a coverage area similar to that of a satellite. High-altitude airships can improve the military's ability to communicate in remote areas such as those in Afghanistan, where mountainous terrain frequently interferes with communications signals. Surveillance and intelligence One of the best examples of a high-altitude platform used for surveillance and security is Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV used by the US Air Force. It has a service ceiling of 20 km and can stay in the air for continuous 36 hours. It carries a highly sophisticated sensor system including radar, optical, and infrared imagers. It is powered by a turbofan engine and is able to deliver digital sensor data in realtime to a ground station.Global Hawk, Federation of American Scientists. Real-time monitoring of a region Another future use that is currently being investigated is monitoring of a particular area or region for activities such as flood detection, seismic monitoring, remote sensing and disaster management.The airborne Remote Sensing technical system of the Chinese Academy of Sciences by Tong Qingxi, The Joint Center for Remote Sinsing of CAS China. Weather and environmental monitoring Perhaps the most common use of high-altitude platforms is for environment/weather monitoring. Numerous experiments are conducted through high-altitude balloons mounted with scientific equipment, which is used to measure environmental changes or to keep track of weather. Recently, NASA in partnership with The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has started using Global Hawk UAV to study Earth's atmosphere.NASA Recruits Unmanned Aircraft for Earth Science, Space.com. As a rocket launch platform Due to the height, more than 90% of atmospheric matter is below the high-altitude platform. This reduces atmospheric drag for starting rockets. \\"As a rough estimate, a rocket that reaches an altitude of 20 km when launched from the ground will reach 100 km if launched at an altitude of 20 km from a balloon.\\" Such a platform has been proposed to allow the usage of (long) mass drivers for launching goods or humans into orbit. ===Lockheed-Martin High-Altitude Airship (HAA)=== The United States Department of Defense Missile Defense Agency contracted Lockheed Martin to construct a High-Altitude Airship (HAA) to enhance its Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). An unmanned lighter- than-air vehicle, the HAA was proposed to operate at a height of above in a quasi-geostationary position to deliver persistent orbital station keeping as a surveillance aircraft platform, telecommunications relay, or a weather observer. They originally proposed to launch their HAA in 2008. The airship would be in the air for up to one month at a time and was intended to survey a diameter of land. It was to use solar cells to provide its power and would be unmanned during its flight. The production concept would be long and in diameter. To minimize weight. it was to be composed of high strength fabrics and use lightweight propulsion technologies. A subscale demonstrator unit for this project, the \\"High Altitude Long Endurance-Demonstrator\\" (HALE-D), was built by Lockheed Martin and launched on a test flight on July 27, 2011 to demonstrate key technologies critical to the development of unmanned airships. The airship was supposed to reach an altitude of , but a problem with the helium levels occurred at which prevented it from reaching its target altitude, and the flight was terminated. It descended and landed at a speed of about 20 feet per secondJim Mackinnon, \\"Lockheed Martin’s prototype blimp crashes during maiden voyage\\", Akron Beacon Journal, ,July 27, 2011 (accessed 25 March 2016) in a heavily forested area in Pennsylvania. Two days after the landing, before the vehicle was recovered from the crash site, the vehicle was destroyed by fire.Jim Mackinnon, \\"Lockheed Martin’s prototype airship burns\\", Akron Beacon Journal, August 2, 2011 (accessed 25 March 2016) ===Stratospheric airship=== A stratospheric airship is a powered airship designed to fly at very high altitudes . Most designs are remote-operated aircraft/unmanned aerial vehicles (ROA/UAV). To date none of these designs have received approval from the FAA to fly in U.S. airspace. Stratospheric airship efforts are being developed in at least five countries. The first stratospheric powered airship flight took place in 1969, reaching for 2 hours with a payload. On December 4, 2005 a team led by Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), sponsored by the Army Space and Missile Defense Command (ASMDC), successfully demonstrated powered flight of the HiSentinel stratospheric airship at an altitude of . Japan and South Korea are also planning to deploy HAAs. South Korea has been conducting flight tests for several years with a vehicle from Worldwide Aeros. === Aircraft === In January 2018, several systems were in development: * AeroVironment will design and development solar-powered UAV prototypes for $65 million for HAPSMobile, a joint venture 95% funded and owned by Japanese telco SoftBank; its -span Helios Prototype first flew in 1999 and reached in 2001 before breaking up in flight in 2003; in 2002, its -span Pathfinder Plus carried a communications payload to FL650; its hydrogen-powered Global Observer designed to stay aloft a week in the stratosphere first flew in 2010 but crashed in 2011. * Airbus builds the Zephyr, spanning and weighing less than , it is designed to stay aloft for months; a 2010 version flew for 14 days, while in July 2018, a Zephyr flew continuously for 25 days, 23 hours, and 57 minutes;Mark Schauer (ATEC) (February 12, 2019) Unmanned aircraft stays aloft for nearly 26 days above U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground * Facebook worked on developing the Aquila solar-powered high-altitude flying-wing UAV to provide internet connectivity, spanning and weighing . It made two low-altitude test flights in 2016 and 2017 and is designed to stay aloft at FL650 for 90 days. On June 27, 2018 Facebook announced it will halt the project and plan to have other companies build the drones. * Thales Alenia Space develops the Stratobus unmanned, solar-powered stratospheric airship, long and weighting including a payload, it is designed for a five-year mission with annual servicing and a prototype is planned for late 2020 * China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation flew a -span solar-powered UAV to FL650 in a 15 hours test flight in July 2017 * Russia's Lavochkin design bureau is flight-testing the LA-252, an -span, solar-powered UAV designed to stay aloft 100 days in the stratosphere. UK mapping agency Ordnance Survey (OS), a subsidiary of the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, is developing the A3, a 38 m (125 ft) wingspan, 149 kg (330 lb) twin-boom solar-powered HAPS designed to stay aloft at for 90 days carrying a payload. OS owns 51% of UK company Astigan, led by Brian Jones, developing the A3 since 2014 with scale model test flights in 2015 and full- scale low-altitude flights in 2016. High-altitude flights should begin in 2019, to complete tests in 2020 with a commercial introduction as for environmental monitoring, mapping, communications and security. Designed by Prismatic Ltd., now BAE Systems, the 35 m (115 ft)-wingspan PHASA-35 made its maiden flight in February 2020 from the Woomera Test Range in South Australia; it should fly its payload at around 70,000 ft for days or weeks. ==HistoryHALE=== The idea of HALE was acknowledged in technical papers as early as 1983, with A preliminary study of solar powered aircraft and associated power trains written by D.W. Hall, C.D. Fortenbach, E.V. Dimiceli and R.W. Parks (NASA CR-3699), the actual state of affairs within technology of a time during the 1970s, allowed for scientists to later consider the possibility of Long endurance flight as a conceivable inclusion to aviation of suborbital spacecraft.D.W. Hall et al - report 3699 prepared for Langley Research Centre published December 1983 [Retrieved 2015-12-09] One of the first papers to explicitly mention Long Endurance is J.W.Youngblood, T.A. Talay & R.J. Pegg Design of Long Endurance Unmanned Airplanes Incorporating Solar and fuel cell propulsion, published 1984. An early paper which incorporates both high- altitude and long-endurance as the area of investigation, is M.D. Maughmer (University Pennsylvania State) and D.M. Somers (NASA Langley) Design and experimental results for a high-altitude, long-endurance airfoil. The authors state interest in development of such a craft lay in the need to fulfill communication relay missions, weather monitoring, and to obtain information for the targeting of cruise missiles. This paper was published in the year 1989.M.D. Maughmer and D.M. Somers - Design and experimental results for a high-altitude, long-endurance airfoil Journal of Aircraft Vol. 26, No. 2 (1989) doi: 10.2514/3.45736 (American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Association) [Retrieved 2015-12-09] The research paper, 2025, written by B.W. Carmichael (Colonel), and Majors, T.E. DeVine, R.J. Kaufman, P.E. Pence and R.E. Wilcox, and presented July 1996, foresaw routine HALE-UAV operations happening within the early 21st century. In contemplation of a future of the military, projected to 2025, the authors thought a HALE in flight for 24 hours. Long endurance (\\"long-loiter\\") is held synonymous with the concept of maintaining air occupation, \\"the ability to hold an adversary continuously at risk from lethal and non-lethal effects from the air\\". The Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office at some time made demonstrations of long-endurance UAV craft. G Frulla (Turin, Italy 2002) wrote a paper on very long endurance.G Frulla - Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G: Journal of Aerospace Engineering April 1, 2002 vol. 216 no. 4 189-196 published by Journal of Aerospace Engineering doi: 10.1243/09544100260369722 [Retrieved 2015-12-09] An important goal of the CAPECON project, instigated by the European Union, was the development of HALE vehicles. ===NASA ERAST Program=== The initial goals under the NASA's Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology (ERAST) project were to demonstrate sustained flight at an altitude near 100,000 feet and flying non- stop for at least 24 hours, including at least 14 hours above 50,000 feet. The early development path of atmospheric satellites included the NASA Pathfinder (exceeding 50,000 feet in 1995), the Pathfinder Plus (80,000 feet in 1998), and the NASA Centurion which was modified into a prototype configuration for the NASA Helios (96,000 feet in 2001). An Airbus/Qinetiq Zephyr flew for 14 days in the summer of 2010, and in 2014 a Zephyr 7 stayed up for 11 days in the short days of winter whilst carrying a small payload for the British Ministry of Defence. ==See also== *Geostationary satellite **Geostationary balloon satellite *High-altitude platform station *High-altitude balloon *Boeing Insitu ScanEagle *ThothX Tower *21st Century Airships *Integrated Sensor is Structure *Long Endurance Multi-intelligence Vehicle *Myasishchev M-55 *TCOM Blue Devil *Tethered blimp ==ReferencesBibliography== C.

A modified version of the production Austin-Healey Sprite, it was recognized by the governing body of motorsport, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile, as a separate model in its own right, featuring Girling disc brakes as well as specified engine and chassis improvements. After its homologation (motorsport) on 17 September 1960, FIA regulations permitted the use of 'special bodies' and a small number of Sebring Sprites were subsequently fitted with coupé bodywork in aluminium alloy and glassfibre, the most strikingly attractive examples being those devised by well-known race and rally driver John Sprinzel, who had won the 1959 RAC British Rally Championship. Sprinzel commissioned the coachbuilders Williams & Pritchard, renowned for their racing and prototype work, to produce the bodies. These are usually said to have numbered six, but eight are known to have been made. Further Sprites received similar alloy bodywork from Alec Goldie and Fred Faulkner of the firm Robert Peel Sheet Metal Works (more usually known as 'Peel Coachworks'). The name 'Sebring Sprite' would become a generic term for any Sprite with disc brakes, and later for any Sprite with coupé or fastback bodywork.'Spritely Years: Race and Rally Memories from the Classic Era Plus the Full History of the Sebring Sprite' (Patrick Stephens, 1994 and John Sprinzel Ltd, 2008) by John Sprinzel and Tom Coulthard (Please note the adjacent picture shows a modern replica Sprinzel Sebring Sprite, as produced by Brian Archer, but fitted with a replica of the Speedwell GT bonnet designed by Frank Costin) == Class domination at the 1959 Twelve Hours of Sebring == Rear view of a period Speedwell Sprite which competed on the 1960 Liège–Rome–Liège rally. For the celebrated long-distance race at Sebring, Florida, in March 1959, the BMC Competition Department entered three Austin- Healey Sprites in the 12 Hours Grand Prix d'Endurance. The cars were prepared by Donald's son Geoffrey Healey at the company's Cape Works in Warwick, and were fitted with a prototype Dunlop disc brake on all four wheels as well as wire wheels (and tyres) from the same company. Larger twin 1-inch SU carburettors gave the engines more performance and special twin-plate racing clutches took the drive to straight-cut close-ratio gearboxes. The cars were raced by Hugh Sutherland, Phil Stiles, Ed Leavens, Dr Harold Kunz, Fred Hayes, John Christy and John Colgate Jnr. Despite setbacks, the Sprites managed to finish first, second and third in their class, and their success in this premier sportscar race, which was part of FIA World Sportscar Championship, gave valuable publicity to BMC in the important North American market. == Healey Sebring Sprites == The Healeys subsequently offered to equip customers' Sprites to a similar specification to the Sebring cars, though using twin 1-inch SU H4 carburettors and a complete replacement braking system by Girling. This comprised 8-inch 'Type 9' calliper discs for the front wheels and 8-inch drums at the rear, with all brake lines, unions, flexibles and fluid being replaced with Girling equipment. One such Sprite (registered 888 HPA) was owned, tuned and raced by Beatrice Shilling, the aeronautical engineer now hailed a Second World War hero for making a small but life-saving improvement to the Spitfires' Merlin engines. These Healey Sebring Sprites were modified at The Cape Works, and from early 1960 also at the small workshop at the London showrooms in Grosvenor Street, where the Healey Speed Equipment Division was run by the then reigning British Rally Champion, John Sprinzel and the chief mechanic was future F1 driver Paul Hawkins.'Lucky John' (The Coulthard Press, 2013) by John Sprinzel John Sprinzel had founded the highly successful tuning firm Speedwell Performance Conversions Ltd, where he was joined by future Formula 1 World Champion Graham Hill. Speedwell developed a sleek, alloy-bodied Sprite coupe, the Speedwell GT, designed by aerodynamicist Frank Costin and built by Williams & Pritchard. However, Donald Healey had managed to lure John Sprinzel away from Speedwell by inviting him to set up the Healey Speed Equipment Division and the promise of Healey works drives at both Sebring and Le Mans. == Sebring 1960 == Because of increasing safety worries about the speed differential between the smallest and largest- engined cars, a separate four-hour race for GT cars of under one litre was organized at Sebring in 1960. Stirling Moss drove a Sebring Sprite to a class win and second overall in this event. In the twelve-hour race, John Sprinzel drove a prototype Sprite with a GRP Falcon kit-car body, built and entered by the Donald Healey Motor Company, to another impressive class win, finishing 41st overall. == Sprinzel Sebring Sprites == Leaving the Healeys to set up his own tuning and race preparation concern at Lancaster Mews in December 1960, John Sprinzel launched his Williams & Pritchard-bodied coupe to immediate acclaim at the Racing Car Show in London. Sprinzel Sebring Sprites were soon being built for racers Ian Walker (WJB 707), Cyril Simson (S 221), Andrew Hedges (410 EAO) and Chris Williams (52 LPH), and for BMC works rally driver David Seigle-Morris (D 20). Sprinzel's personal Sebring Sprite bore the registration number PMO 200, and he campaigned the car at Sebring and in international rallies as well as races throughout the 1961 season, culminating in an outright win in the Targa Rusticana rally at the beginning of 1962. == Sebring 1961 == No less than 7 Sebring Sprites contested the long-distance races at Sebring in 1961. Five Healey-prepared BMC works cars were driven by Ed Leavens, Briggs Cunningham, Dick Thompson, Bruce McLaren and Walt Hansgen. There were also two of John Sprinzel's striking coupes, piloted by one of the top-rated Grand Prix drivers of all time, Stirling Moss, together with his sister Pat Moss, Britain's most successful woman rally driver. The Sebring Sprites finished in six of the top eight places in the 4-hour race for one- litre homologated GT cars. In the 12-hour race, Sebring Sprites were driven by Ed Leavens, John Colgate, Joe Buzetta, Glenn Carlson, Cyril Simson and future F1 driver Paul Hawkins to strong performances, finishing 2nd, 3rd and 4th in the 1150cc sports (prototype) class and 15th and 25th and 37th overall. == Later Sebring Sprites == Over the years, the cars were sold to privateers who raced and rallied them. In later years, the Sebring Sprite became a prized possession and the object of veneration within the Austin-Healey fraternity. Enthusiasts sought out the cars, sometimes discovering them in advanced stages of deterioration. Today, the cars are cherished classics that can be driven to and from competitions just like the originals were in their day. Subsequently, numbers of other Sprites were modified as period replicas of the original Speedwell GTs and Sprinzel Sebring Sprites, built to the same homologated specification. One such car is the \\"Lumbertubs\\" Sprite, built in 1963 by brothers Brian and Ken Myers and named after the lane where they lived. The alloy roof was crafted by Alan Thompson of Aston Martin and a fibreglass Williams & Pritchard's Sebring bonnet was fitted. In 1965 it acquired a Ford engine and gearbox, gaining some success in sprints and hillclimbs and winning its class at the St. John Horsfall meeting at Silverstone on 24 June 1967. == References == *John Sprinzel's Austin-Healey Sebring Sprite Coupés Sebring Sprite Category:Coupés Category:Rally cars Category:Sports cars Category:Grand tourer racing cars Category:Cars introduced in 1959 Category:1960s cars ","title":"Austin-Healey Sebring Sprite"},{"id":"19281550","text":"Tenericutes (tener cutis: soft skin) is a phylum of bacteria that contains the class Mollicutes.

The music score is by Pierre Bachelet. It was filmed in locations all over France and a fantasy scene in New York in late 1992 and early 1993. This was Kristel's return to the title role after not appearing in both Emmanuelle 5 and Emmanuelle 6, but her return was not a happy one, due to financing her husband's failing film projects that drained her financially, she agreed to star in the film, but only in a non-sex role. ==Plot== Emmanuelle now runs a clinic and laboratory that uses the sexual memories and the usage of virtual reality computer simulations on its clients to help them achieve sexual ecstasy, or help them heal, depending on the subject. She helps an old girlfriend from school (Laurence) overcome her traumatic sexual history due to a nun splashing cold water on her during her first sexual experience in her teen years in a girl's locker room with a young Emannuelle watching. She also takes on several other women and a few rich men, who go through the same type of \\"sexual therapy\\" to become better lovers in the real world - for a very heavy price. To help her friend to overcome her trauma, Emmanuelle puts her into several simulations. In the first one, she could have her first sex without the nun splashing water; the second one, she could have sex with Emmanuelle with the dormitory girls watching them; at the third, she could get revenge on the man that raped her; and on the fourth, she walks naked at a male bathhouse among several naked men so she could seduce as many as possible until she could perform a sandwich sex. That helped her regain affection with men again. While the rest of the men watch her having an extreme orgasm with those men penetrating her simultaneously, a third man came along and gives her a passionate kiss, which gave her an much bigger and more powerful orgasm, but it was interrupted, making her fall in love with the man that wasn't penetrating her. At the end of the film, the old friend is healed and is no longer repressed and as the wife of a powerful film executive. In the Cannes Film Festival, Sophie gives him an discreet oral sex, followed by full public sex on a podium stand in front of the world press, who applauded the couple once they climax. (The film had one groundbreaking element to it in that computers were being employed to watch pornography and other's fantasies, and that in the future, this would become integral to the making of porn and erotic movies itself.) ==Release== The film was finally released on October 20, 1993 with a run time of only 90 minutes. In Germany it was released as \\"Digital Love\\". It made very little money, the critics panned it and was considered a flop. Kristel never was asked or considered doing another film in the series of any incarnation again. This was the last of the original \\"Emmanuelle\\" series, as a new straight-to-video VHS (and later DVD) hardcore series started a year later with younger actors and newer (and much more adult) erotic plots with full sexual situations that had absolutely nothing to do with the original softcore stories. ==Cast== *Sylvia Kristel as Emmanuelle *Caroline Laurence as Sophie *Laura Dean as Marie *Annie Bellac as Young Emmanuelle *Cynthia Van Damme as Young Sophie *Julie Jalabert as Melanie *Roland Waden as Frantz Gotzerman *Joel Bui as Atisan Khan *Roberto Malone as Carlos ==References *Emmanuelle 7 at Amazon.com * * Category:1992 films Category:French films Category:1990s pornographic films Category:Emmanuelle Category:1990s erotic drama films Category:French erotic drama films Category:French pornographic films Category:1992 drama films ","title":"Emmanuelle 7"},{"id":"19281610","text":"Q-analysis is a mathematical framework to describe and analyze set systems, or equivalently simplicial complexes. This idea was first introduced by Ronald Atkin in the early 1970s. Atkin was a British mathematician teaching at the University of Essex. Crediting the inspiration of his idea to Clifford Dowker’s paper (Homology Groups of Relations, Annals of Mathematics, 1952), he became interested in the algebra of relations in social structures. He tried to explain his idea in both mathematical and also accessible forms to both technical and general audience. His main ideas are reflected in The Mathematical Structure of Human Affairs (1974). That book covers the key ideas in q-analysis and its application to a wide range of examples, like analyzing game of chess, urban structures, politics at university, people and complexes, works of abstract art, and to physics. He contended that q-analysis can be considered as a powerful generalized method wherever we are dealing with relationships among sets.Jacky Legrand. How far can Q-analysis go into social systems understanding?. Fifth European Systems Science Congress, 2002. Q-analysis == Description == A simplex of vertices can be represented as a polyhedron in dimensions, so that for example a triangle of three vertices can be drawn on a plane of two dimensions and is accordingly called a 2-simplex. When simplices share vertices, the intersections of their vertex sets are themselves simplices of equal or lower dimension. For example, two triangles with two vertices in common share not only the two 0-simplex vertices but the 1-simplex line between them. The triangles are said to be both 1- and 0-connected because they share 1- and 0-dimensional faces. Q-analysis of a simplicial complex consists in stepping through all up to the dimension of the largest simplex and constructing for each a graph of the simplices that are -connected at each level, and in particular, determining how many connected components are present for each .* Atkin, R. (1974). Mathematical Structure in Human Affairs. London, Heinemann.

Starting in 1984, Salin worked to create AMIX as an international network for the exchange of information, consulting contracts, computer code and research. He envisaged a world in which the ready exchange of expertise would reduce transaction costs, with wide-ranging beneficial effects. In particular, he predicted that information markets would reduce the need for redundant employees at different organizations, so that companies would become smaller and more efficient, relying on each other as external sources of expertise. He also expected revolutionary political changes as the markets became widely adopted. The AMIX project originated long before the widespread deployment of the Internet, so the challenge of creating the market was compounded by the technical difficulty of creating the network on which it would run. Autodesk acquired a controlling interest in AMIX in 1988 and funded it until shortly after Phil Salin died in December 1991. Among early adopters, the computer industry itself became the source of many early markets such as a network for the exchange of libraries of object-oriented computer code.

Although up to six seats could be fitted, the only F.K.40 built flew with four. ==Operational history== This aircraft, registered PH-AES and nicknamed Piet Haas (\\"Peter Hare\\"), was operated by KLM until it was sold into private hands in 1936.

From 1963–71, she was the second wife of country star Willie Nelson. ==Life and career== Born in Chillicothe, Missouri, to Alice (née Davis) and Henry Simpson, she sang at local war bond rallies during World War II as a child, and made a guest appearance on KFEQ-AM in St. Joseph, Missouri.\\"Guitar-Playing Chillicothe Girl Makes Good on Roundup Radio Programs\\" (1948) Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune, p. 1 In 1945, at age 14, Simpson replaced \\"Sue\\" on the weekday morning Millie and Sue show on KMBC-AM in Kansas City, and the duo also appeared on the station's Brush Creek Follies barn dance show. She bought her Little Martin guitar from the previous Sue, an instrument she would use for the rest of her career. Her first marriage, at 15, lasted until she was 19.\\"Chillicothe Native Publishes Book (September 11, 2008) Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune In 1950, Simpson moved to Texas to play with Bob Wills, Johnnie Lee Wills and other Texas bands. She settled in Corpus Christi and performed locally until the fall of 1955, when the redhead was offered a regular role on ABC-TV’s Ozark Jubilee in Springfield, Missouri and signed a recording contract with ABC-Paramount. In 1956, she released her first singles on the label under her Jubilee stage name, Shirley Caddell, and made a guest appearance on The Eddy Arnold Show. In 1957, she recorded two singles with Lefty Frizzell on Columbia Records, as well as two solo numbers. In 1958, she left Springfield to tour with The Philip Morris Country Music Show based in Nashville, Tennessee, where she met the show's manager and emcee, Hiram \\"Biff\\" Collie, a country music disc jockey on KFOX-AM in Long Beach, California. They married and she moved to Hollywood, appearing on Country America on KABC-TV. Both were also regulars on KTTV-TV's Town Hall Party, and Collie was a guest on NBC-TV's You Bet Your Life in 1960. Starting in 1960, Collie released singles on the Liberty Records label with Floyd Tillman, Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys, and Clyde Beavers. In 1961, she made her chart debut with the Harlan Howard song “Dime a Dozen,” which rose to No. 25 on the Billboard country chart. That same year, \\"Why Baby Why\\", her duet with Warren Smith, reached No. 23. Soon record producer Joe Allison approached her to sing with Willie Nelson, who previous singers had been unable to sing harmony with him due to his style. Their 1962 duet, \\"Willingly\\", climbed to No. 10 and was his first chart hit, but it failed to establish him as a star. In 1962, Collie was offered the role of semi-regular character Pearl Bodine on the CBS-TV series The Beverly Hillbillies, but instead began touring with Nelson, playing bass guitar in his band. They married in Las Vegas in 1963. As Nelson's career flourished, he talked her into staying home in Ridgetop outside Nashville, where she helped raise his three children by his first wife, Martha. The couple co-wrote his 1968 single \\"Little Things\\", and she is credited with writing his singles \\"I Hope So\\" (1969) and \\"Once More With Feeling\\" (1970). After she discovered Nelson had fathered a daughter with Connie Koepke, who would become his third wife, their marriage fell apart and they divorced in 1971. In the years following, however, she would perform and yodel with Nelson when he toured in Missouri until she retired; and the two collaborated on her 2009 book, Memoir: Scrapbooks in My Mind: Featuring Shirley and Willie Nelson and Many Others. From 1987-89, Nelson worked for the state of Missouri with the mentally disabled. She continued to perform in Branson, Missouri and received a lifetime achievement award from KMBZ in 1996. Nelson died in Springfield, Missouri on January 27, 2010, aged 78, following a long illness, and was buried at White Chapel Memorial Gardens in Springfield. She was survived by her husband, Ed Melton, and a sister, Mary Lou Ritchie. ==DiscographyAlbums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:22em;\\" Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Details !

He was exceedingly powerful early in the reign of Emperor Daizong and was said to, in his attempts to consolidate his power, have killed or demoted a number of key generals and officials on his own whim, and thus drew the hatred from the other officials and generals. In 763, he was blamed for not warning Emperor Daizong about the Tubo invasion that eventually caused the capital Chang'an to fall to Tubo forces, forcing Emperor Daizong to flee. Emperor Daizong exiled him, and he died in exile. == Background == Cheng Yuanzhen was from Jingzhao Municipality () -- the special municipality centered on the Tang capital Chang'an. He was a eunuch from his youth and served at the eunuch bureau (內侍省, Neishi Sheng), eventually rising to be the commander of the imperial guard archer corps (內射生使, Nei Shesheng Shi) as well as the deputy director of the imperial stables, under the powerful eunuch Li Fuguo, late in the reign of Emperor Suzong. == Rise to power == In summer 762, Emperor Suzong was seriously ill, near death. By this point, Emperor Suzong's wife Empress Zhang, who was previously allied with Li Fuguo, was no longer allied with him, and she tried to enter into an alliance with Emperor Suzong's son (not her son) the crown prince Li Yu, to kill Li Fuguo and Cheng Yuanzhen and seize power. Li Yu declined, and she then entered into an alliance with Li Yu's younger brother Li Xi () the Prince of Yue, trying to lay a trap for Li Fuguo (and possibly Li Yu). When she issued an edict in Emperor Suzong's name summoning Li Yu, Cheng found out about her plan and detained Li Yu, escorting him to the imperial guard headquarters. He and Li Fuguo then led troops into the palace and arrested Empress Zhang and Li Xi. Upon Emperor Suzong's death, Li Fuguo executed Empress Zhang, Li Xi, and Li Xian () the Prince of Yan, and then declared Li Yu emperor (as Emperor Daizong). For two months early in Emperor Daizong's reign, Li Fuguo was exceedingly powerful, so much so that he was telling Emperor Daizong not to bother with any thing and just let him handle the matters of state, and Emperor Daizong gave him chancellor title, as well as several other honorific titles. Cheng was made a commanding general of the imperial guards, but was not satisfied, as he wanted to take over Li Fuguo's power, and therefore he secretly plotted with Emperor Daizong. With cooperation from Cheng, later in summer 762, Emperor Daizong, while creating Li Fuguo a prince, stripped Li Fuguo of his military command and transferred it to Cheng. Li Fuguo was subsequently assassinated on Emperor Daizong's orders, and Emperor Daizong and Cheng governed together. It was said that Cheng was suspicious and jealous of the senior generals and officials and did what he could to strip them of power. For example, he was jealous of Guo Ziyi and often criticized him before Emperor Daizong, leading Guo, who was fearful of the situation, to resign his command and remain at Chang'an. When the senior official Pei Mian had disagreements with Cheng, Cheng had Pei demoted to the remote Shi Prefecture (施州, roughly modern Enshi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, Hubei). Meanwhile, he sometimes made requests of the general Lai Tian () -- the military governor (Jiedushi) of Shannan East Circuit (山南東道, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei), which Lai rejected, and thus he was resentful of Lai. In 763, while Lai was at Chang'an, he and his associate Wang Zhongsheng (), who was also resentful of Lai, jointly falsely accused Lai of treason. Lai was exiled and, on the way to exile, was ordered to commit suicide. Cheng also disliked the major general Li Guangbi and often submitted reports against Li Guangbi. The general Li Huairang (), the military governor of Tonghua Circuit (同華, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), was also falsely accused by Cheng and committed suicide in fear in 763. It was said that given these incidents, all of the generals felt insecure and alienated from the imperial government. Despite this, Cheng was still arrogant and believed that he could grab more power. == Downfall == Throughout the spring and summer of 763, Tibetan, or Tubo, forces were progressively attacking and capturing Tang prefectures to the west of Chang'an. It was said that despite the generals' urgent requests for aid, Cheng Yuanzhen did not relay the requests to Emperor Daizong. By winter 763, Tibetan forces were approaching Chang'an; only then did Emperor Daizong realize the seriousness of the Tibetan threat and commission Guo Ziyi to resist the Tibetan Empire. When Emperor Daizong issued an edict to the various circuits ordering emergency aid, however, the generals refused to respond, and Guo could not quickly gather troops large enough to resist Tibetan forces. Emperor Daizong was forced to abandon Chang'an and flee to Shan Prefecture (陝州, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). The imperial officials who followed Emperor Daizong to Shan Prefecture blamed the disaster on Cheng—in both his failure to alert Emperor Daizong as to the seriousness of the Tibetan threat and his alienation of the generals, causing a lack of aid to arrive. The imperial scholar Liu Kang () submitted a harshly worded petition, asking that Cheng be executed. Emperor Daizong, however, remembering how Cheng had protected him in the past, declined to do so. He did, however, remove Cheng from his offices and order that he return home. When Emperor Daizong returned to Chang'an around the new year 764, Cheng heard the news. Putting on women's clothing in disguise, he secretly entered Chang'an and plotted to return to power.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 223. He was arrested by the Jingzhao Municipality government, and the imperial censors subsequently submitted an indictment against him. In spring 764, Emperor Daizong exiled him to Zhen Prefecture (榛州, in modern Chongqing), but soon changed the location of exile to the more prosperous city of Jiangling. Cheng died there, in exile, shortly after arriving there. == Notes and references == * Old Book of Tang, vol. 184. * New Book of Tang, vol. 207. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 222, 223.

The conversion proved successful and twenty had been converted at Eveleigh Railway Workshops by 1902. In 1924 the class was renumbered becoming the Z13 class. Following the delivery of C30 class locomotives from 1903, they were transferred to Newcastle suburban traffic and when replaced there, were allocated minor roles such as working the Carlingford, Morpeth and Warren branches. Two were sold to East Greta Mining & Railway Company, one to Ashtonfields Colliery, Thornton and a fourth scrapped. In later years their main duties were working of the Ballina branch, the Picton-Mittagong Loop line, the Yass Town branch and school trains on the upper North Coast. ==Preservation== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" - ! colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#FFB300\\"  Preserved Z13 Class Locomotives - !No.!!Description!!Manufacturer!!Rebuild!!Current Organisation!!Location!!Status!!Ref --E5E5FF\\"  1301 4-4-2T passengerBeyer, Peacock and Company1896Transport Heritage NSWThirlmere static exhibit NSW Locomotive, Steam 1301 -  1307 4-4-2T passenger Beyer, Peacock and Company1902Australian Railway Historical Society (ACT) Yass static exhibitNSW Locomotive, Steam 1307 --E5E5FF\\"  1308 4-4-2T passenger Beyer, Peacock and Company1902 StarpsValley HeightsdismantledSteam 1308 } ==Gallery== Image:NSWGR Z13 Class Locomotive Z1313 (CC) No.172.jpg Z1313 Image:NSWGR Z13 Class Locomotive Z1308.jpgZ1308 Image:NSWGR Z13 Class Locomotive Z1301 (CC) No.79.jpgZ1301 (CC) No.79 Image:NSWGR Z13 Class Locomotive 1309 (CC) No.123.jpg 1309 (CC) No.123.jpg Image:NSWGR Z13 Class Locomotive Z1311 (CC) No.415.jpg Z1311 (CC) No.415 Image:NSWGR Z13 Class Locomotive Z1305 (CC) No.90.jpg Z1305 (CC) No.90.

The fuselage was of welded steel tube construction, covered in fabric, which was oval in cross section at the nose, transitioning to a rectangular cross-section for the passenger cabin. The wings were wooden structures skinned in plywood. The sole example built was registered PH-AJX and quickly gained the nickname Ajax. It was used by KLM on the Rotterdam-Eindhoven route until 1936, when it was retired to training and instructional duties within the airline. ==SpecificationsReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * Koolhoven Aeroplanes Foundation * Уголок неба Category:1930s Dutch airliners FK.48 Category:Aircraft first flown in 1934 ","title":"Koolhoven F.K.48"},{"id":"19281992","text":"Metallosia is a genus of moths in the subfamily Arctiinae.

It is the first and only TV movie in the Wishbone franchise. ==Plot== It starts out with Joe and Wishbone going to the Summer Carnival. Melina and the Oakdale Glee Club are singing on stage; the wiring breaks, causing the stage lights to collapse, but not before Wishbone and Wanda save the children. The reporter \\"congratulates\\" her. Then, in the Wild West, Long Bill Longley and his best friend, Tom Merwin (Brent Anderson), team up to stop a villain named Calliope Catesby. Meanwhile, the same sneaky TV reporter tries to make Wanda Gilmore (Angee Hughes) seem as if she is the town tyrant. It is up to Wishbone and his friends to come to Wanda's rescue. ==Cast Main cast === * Soccer (dog) as Wishbone (Larry Brantley as the voice of Wishbone) * Jordan Wall as Joseph \\"Joe\\" Talbot * Mary Chris Wall as Ellen MacWilliam Talbot * Christie Abbott as Samantha \\"Sam\\" Kepler * Bob Reed as Walter Kepler * Angee Hughes as Wanda Gilmore * Paul English, Jr. as Marcus Finch * Mikaila Enriquez as Melina Finch * Steve Kavner as Mitchell \\"Mitch\\" McCain * Sean McGraw as Mr. Leon King * Lewis Barnett Finnagan III as Hank Dutton * Jim Ponds as Ethan Johnstone * Julio Cedillo as Travis Del Rio * Constance Jones as Helen Davidson * Adam Sanchez as Dan Bloodgood * Adair Ahrens as Ginny * Raphael Parry as Giles Gilmore * Todd Terry as Abel Skeleton * Dell Johnson as Lee Johnstone === Wild West Story Cast === * Wishbone as Long Bill Longley * Brent Anderson as Tom Merwin * Sally Nystuen Vahle as Mame Dugan * Mark Walters as Calliope Catesby * Matthew Tompkins as Marshall Buck * Akin Babatunde as Coop * Molly McClure as Mrs. Catesby, Calliope's Mother * Marc Mouchet as George * Ray Reinhardt as The Magistrate * Brennan Leverenz as Ed Merwin * William Lawrence Allen as William Porter (O'Henry) ==Reception== The movie won a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Art Direction/Set Decoration/Scenic Design in 1998. It was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Costume Design/Styling, Outstanding Directing in a Children's Special, and Outstanding Main Title Design in 1999. A Common Sense Media review says, \\"The pleasing visuals and fast-moving, double-trouble plots make Dog Days of the West one of the best in the Wishbone series. The value of friendship is emphasized in this episode; the show exposes children to O. Henry's short stories and infuses the traditional western with an updated perspective. As unlikely as it seems, Wishbone's wild west fable blends nicely with the contemporary story of a TV reporter running roughshod over one of Oakdale's finest citizens. With two fast moving plots, finely drawn characters and exciting historical visuals, Dog Days of the West will keep kids, and many adults, glued to the screen\\". ==References * Category:American children's films Category:American films Category:1998 films Category:Fictional dogs Category:1998 television films Category:Films about Native Americans Category:Adaptations of works by O.

New York: St Martin's Press., He was educated at Eton,Peerage. he eventually ran away from the school, supposedly selling his fur coat and gun to travel to join the Second Boer War. He succeeded his father in the earldom in January 1924. ==Military service== Lord Brooke was a second lieutenant in the 7th (Militia) Battalion of The King's Royal Rifle Corps, and was seconded for service with a line battalion in March 1900. He fought in the Second Boer War (1899–1901), and was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant in the Life Guards on 3 November 1900. From August 1901 he served as Aide-de-Camp to Lord Milner, High Commissioner for South Africa, an appointment he held until the conclusion of the war in 1902. He was also a Reuters correspondent during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905). In 1907 he was Aide-de-Camp to the Inspector-General of the Forces. In 1905 he was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO). During the First World War he was Aide-de-Camp to the General Officer Commanding of the British Expeditionary Force from 1914 until 1915. He was then promoted to Brigadier General later that year and commanded 4th Canadian Infantry Brigade and then 12th Canadian Infantry Brigade until 1918. Letters and passports indicate that Leopold was present in Russia during 1917 and probably witnessed the beginnings of the Russian Revolution. There are no comprehensive records as to the reasons for his visit, however, which sparked rumors that he may have been a spy for the Russian or the British royal families. ===Death=== Much speculation and rumour surrounds the demise of Leopold and his premature death in 1928. It has been suggested that Leopold suffered from shell shock after his return from World War One, which was later fueled by severe alcoholism. In his final years he moved out of Warwick Castle to live with a mistress in Mill Street, Warwick. He eventually died in Brighton, where he was being treated for his illness. ==Personal life== Marjorie Eden, Lady Brooke, later Countess of Warwick (1887-1943) (John Singer Sargent) On 29 April 1909, Lord Warwick married Elfrida Marjorie Eden (1887–1943). She was the only daughter of Sir William Eden, 7th Baronet and Sybil Frances Grey (a daughter Sir William Grey KCSI by his second wife). Together, Lord Warwick and Elfrida were the parents of three children: * Charles Guy Fulke Greville, 7th Earl of Warwick (1911–1984). * Hon. Richard Francis Maynard Greville (1913–1968), who served as a Governor of University College Hospital from 1952 to 1968. * Hon. John Ambrose Henry Greville (1918–1942), who was killed in action.

He was the longtime manager of legendary boxer Muhammad Ali. Muhammad was born in Detroit, Michigan, as the third son of the Nation of Islam leader, Elijah Muhammad. He served as a chief adviser to his father until his departure in 1975. He also worked as the chief business manager for the Nation of Islam, and he along with Malcolm X founded their weekly newspaper. Jabir Muhammad was a staunch supporter of his brother, Imam Warith Deen Muhammad, whom he followed into mainstream Islam. He, along with Muhammad Ali and others, built Masjid Al-Fatir, a stand-alone, purpose- built Masjid on the south side of Chicago, Illinois. This was one of the first mosques built from the ground by Muslim Americans, especially African American Muslims. Muhammad was the director and founder of the Muhammad Islamic Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation which published the book Prayer and Al-Islam by Imam Warith Deen Mohammed in 1984. Muhammad managed Muhammad Ali's professional boxing career from 1966 when he took over Ali's management after the expiry of Ali's management agreement with the Louisville Sponsoring Group, until Ali's retirement in 1981. Muhammad negotiated the first multimillion- dollar earnings for any athlete, starting with the $2.5M Ali earned for the Frazier vs Ali \\"Fight of the Century\\" in March 1971 and including the $5.5M purse Ali achieved for the Foreman vs Ali \\"Rumble in the Jungle\\" in Zaire in 1974. Muhammad was considered one of the most powerful figures in boxing in the 1960s and 1970s, achieving the International Boxing Hall of Fame's 1974 \\"Manager of the Year\\" award. He continued to manage Ali's career for another ten years after his retirement from boxing. Muhammad then went on to a successful career in business. Jabir Herbert Muhammad died on August 25, 2008, at the University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago, at the age of 79, after undergoing heart surgery. He was survived by his wife, Amenah Antonia Muhammad, and fourteen children. ==Criticism== Muhammad has been criticized for his handling of Ali's money and for allowing him to continue boxing into \\"fistic old age\\". This led to suggestions of exploitation of Ali given the fighter's early indications of health issues from around 1977 onwards, when \\"ring doctor\\" Ferdie Pacheco wrote to Muhammad amongst others to recommend that Ali cease fighting, given what he saw as emerging health issues in the fighter. Instead Ali kept fighting for another four years, judged by many to be a major contributory factor in Ali's eventual Parkinson's disease diagnosis. Others questioned Muhammad's actual business acumen, given Ali's financial profligacy and lack of quality income generating activity post- retirement. Ali's financial affairs improved in the 1990s after his management was taken over largely by his wife, Lonnie Ali. Ali's business affairs from the 1990s onward had little or nothing to do with Muhammad. ==References * New York Times: Jabir Herbert Muhammad, Who Managed Muhammad Ali, Dies at 79 * Final Call: Memories of the life, work of Jabir Muhammad by Richard Muhammad Category:2008 deaths Category:American boxing managers Category:American sports businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from Chicago Category:Elijah Muhammad family Category:African-American Muslims Category:1929 births ","title":"Jabir Herbert Muhammad"},{"id":"19282029","text":"Metastatia is a genus of moths in the subfamily Arctiinae.

She is the younger sister of comedian Craig Ferguson and is known for voicing the character of Mac in the animated film, Chicken Run. ==Early life== Ferguson grew up in Cumbernauld. She was the youngest of four and, like her sister, was Senior Prefect at Cumbernauld High School. She left school at the age of 18 and worked one season as a Bluecoat for Pontin's. She was then accepted at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama where she gained a BA in Dramatic Studies in 1986. To work as a professional actress, however, she required an Equity union card which was at that point only available through paid work, so with fellow student she formed the Alexander Sisters – a comedy double act parodying traditional Scottish variety styles typified by the Alexander Brothers. She was then sidetracked into standup comedy doing her first paid gig on STV's Funny Farm. Before long she gained residence as compere at the Red Rose Comedy Club in Finsbury Park, London and continued to perform at numerous gigs throughout the UK. Though a comic at night, Ferguson was also writing and presenting for BBC Scotland's children's program Megamag. She played a comedy character journalist Fergski who blundered through interviewing teen artists of that era – Ant & Dec, Aswad and Michelle Gayle. In one episode a spritely Phill Jupitus dresses as a security guard stops Fergski interviewing East 17 at the now defunct Top of the Pops set. In 1995, she was commissioned to write an hour of standup comedy for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival but instead wrote her first play, Heart and Sole. This solo show won her the Stage Award for Acting Excellence and transferred to the Hampstead Theatre before being toured to Hong Kong and Melbourne. ==CareerWriter=== Ferguson has written extensively for BBC Radio 4: three series (18 episodes) of the popular sitcom Millport, various pieces for Woman's Hour including a series of updated fairy tales called After Happy Ever alongside afternoon plays (\\"The Lie\\" \\"The Fly\\" \\"Kindling\\") and late night standup monologues. For BBC Radio Scotland she wrote and presented a series exploring the minds of comedy writers, Laughed Off the Page, interviewing Colin Bostock- Smith, Galton and Simpson, Ian Pattison, and Dick Vosburgh. For TV, she has written half-hour pilots for BBC Two and BBC Scotland and a half-hour short film for Channel 4. A regular contributor to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, eight of her plays have been produced there and she has won a Fringe First Award from The Scotsman. In 2016, she returned to Edinburgh, writing the play \\"Careful\\" for Horse McDonald, and again in 2017, co-writing \\"Life, Death and Duran Duran\\" with one of her story clients, Sam Shaber. November 2017, she premiered her new play The Weir Sisters in Glasgow at Òran Mór Play, pie and a pint As well as her performance pieces, she has written various columns for publications including The Scotsman, The Stage, Time Out, The Big Issue and The Herald. She wrote for The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, her brother's American chat program, from October 2008 to June 2011. She was also a writing consultant for Pixar on the film Brave. ===Actress=== As well as winning the Stage Award for Acting Excellence she has been nominated twice. In addition to her own written works, she has performed in theatre extensively. Ferguson toured with the Royal National Theatre in the lead part, Shen Te/ Shui Ta, of the Bertolt Brecht play The Good Person of Szechwan and played the lead in the Traverse Theatre production of Douglas Maxwell's Melody. Vocally, she has numerous credits for radio works and played Mac in the film Chicken Run. For TV she performed regular parts for the Channel 4, comedy drama No Angels and Ben Elton's BBC1 sitcom Blessed, as well as appearances in The Catherine Tate Show and The Bill amongst others. ===As herself=== Ferguson has presented a number of programs including, Doing the Festival for STV and XS, an arts program for the BBC.

Most bacteria, in terms of diversity, are diderms and stain gram- negative, notable exceptions being Firmicutes (low G+C gram-positives), Actinobacteria (high-G+C gram-positives) and the Deinococcus–Thermus group (gram-positive diderms with thick peptidoglycan). In contrast, the members of the phylum Chloroflexi are monoderms, but stain mostly gram-negative. ==History== The taxon name was created in the 2001 edition of Volume 1 of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology and is the Latin plural of the name Chloroflexus, the name of the type genus of the phylum, a common practice. In 1987, Carl Woese, regarded as the forerunner of the molecular phylogeny revolution, divided Eubacteria into 11 divisions based on 16S ribosomal RNA (SSU) sequences and grouped the genera Chloroflexus, Herpetosiphon and Thermomicrobium into the \\"green non-sulfur bacteria and relatives\\", which was temporarily renamed as \\"Chloroflexi\\" in Volume One of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. Chloroflexi being a deep branching phylum (see Bacterial phyla), it was considered in Volume One of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology to include a single class with the same name, the class Chloroflexi. Since 2001, however, new classes have been created thanks to newly discovered species, and the phylum Chloroflexi is now divided as follows: * Chloroflexi Gupta et al. 2012 * Thermomicrobia Hugenholtz & Stackebrandt, 2004 * \\"Dehalococcoidetes\\" Hugenholtz & Stackebrandt, 2004 * Anaerolineae Yamada et al., 2006 * Caldilineae Yamada et al., 2006 * Ktedonobacteria Cavaletti et al., 2007 emend. Yabe et al., 2010 \\"Dehalococcoidetes\\" is a placeholder name given by Hugenholtz & Stackebrandt, 2004, after \\"Dehalococcoides ethenogenes\\" a species partially described in 1997. The first species fully described was Dehalogenimonas lykanthroporepellens, by Moe et al. 2009, but in the description of that species the class was not made official nor were families or orders laid out as the two species share only 90% 16S ribosomal RNA identity, meaning that they could fall in different families or even orders. Recent phylogenetic analysis of the Chloroflexi has found very weak support for the grouping together of the different classes currently part of the phylum. The six classes that make up the phylum did not consistently form a well-supported clade in phylogenetic trees based on concatenated sequences for large datasets of proteins, and no conserved signature indels were identified that were uniquely shared by the entire phylum. However, the classes Chloroflexi and Thermomicrobia were found to group together consistently by both the usual phylogenetic means and the identification of shared conserved signature indels in the 50S ribosomal protein L19 and the enzyme UDP-glucose 4-epimerase. It has been suggested that the phylum Chloroflexi sensu stricto should comprise only the classes Chloroflexi and Thermomicrobia, and the other four classes (\\"Dehalococcoidetes,\\" Anaerolineae, Caldilineae and Ktedonobacteria) may represent one or more independent phyla branching in the neighborhood of the Chloroflexi. ==Phylogeny== The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

The noun is a combination of the Greek adjective chloros, -a, on (χλωρός, -ά, -όν), meaning \\"greenish-yellow,\\" and the Latin masculine passive perfect participle flexus (of flecto),Lewis & Short... meaning \\"bent.\\" The etymology is unrelated to chlorine, an element that was discovered in 1810 by Sir Humphry Davy and named after its pale green colour. Another phylum with the same root is Chlorobi, whereas Cyanobacteria has the root cyanos (κύανος), meaning \\"blue-green.\\" Unlike some other phyla, there is no theme root in the name of genera of Chloroflexi, and in fact many genera beginning with \\"Chloro-\\" or ending in \\"-chloris\\" are either cyanobacteria or chlorobi. ==References== Category:Phototrophic bacteria Category:Bacteria phyla ","title":"Chloroflexi (phylum)"},{"id":"19282240","text":"Myrmecopsis is a genus of tiger moths in the family Erebidae.

Биография на сайте СВР РФ ==Biography== The son of a Jewish blacksmith, when Mukasei he was 18 he started studying at the Institute of Oriental Languages in Leningrad, specializing in Bengali and English. In 1937 he was ordered by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to study at the Intelligence School of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. In 1939, he and his wife Elizaveta (née Emelianov, 1912–2009) and their two children, moved to Los Angeles and began gathering military intelligence. Mukasei's parents and other members of his family were killed by the Germans. In 1943, Mukasei, his wife and children returned to Moscow and he was appointed deputy head of the Intelligence School. From the 1940s through the 1970s, Mukasei, along with his wife Elizaveta (codenamed Elza), took part in a number of undercover operations in Western Europe and the United States. The Daily TelegraphElizaveta Mukasei, Soviet Spy, Is Dead at 97 The New York Times; accessed 16 September 2017. Assigned to the Soviet diplomatic staff in the United States during the Second World War as vice consul in Los Angeles, Mukasei made use of his position to gather information on any threats to the Soviet Union posed by Imperial Japan. He continued his work in an undisclosed country in Western Europe from the 1950s to the late 1970s. In 1977 Mukasei and his family returned to Moscow and began training spies.

Caroline Polachek and Aaron Pfenning formed Chairlift in 2005 while living in Boulder, Colorado, and Patrick Wimberly joined them when they moved to Brooklyn in 2007. In 2008, Chairlift released their debut album Does You Inspire You. Pfenning left the band in 2010, and as a duo, Polachek and Wimberly released two more albums: 2012's Something and 2016's Moth before announcing the end of Chairlift in December 2016. ==History== Chairlift formed initially as a project between Aaron Pfenning and Caroline Polachek at the University of Colorado in October 2005. The group intended to make background music for haunted houses. Along with bassist Kyle McCabe, Chairlift recorded the beginning of Daylight Savings EP at New Monkey Studio in Los Angeles, California in April 2006. Chairlift relocated to Williamsburg, Brooklyn in August 2006 and signed to Kanine Records in June 2007. Patrick Wimberly joined the group in early 2007. After writing and recording while Polachek was still in college, Chairlift released their first full-length album, Does You Inspire You, in 2008. Their song \\"Bruises\\" was featured in the 2008 Apple commercial that launched the fourth- generation iPod Nano. The single \\"Evident Utensil\\" was nominated for an award in the \\"Breakthrough Video\\" category at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. The album was rereleased by Columbia Records on April 21, 2009, after the band signed with the major label. The re-release included two additional tracks not on the original release and a longer version of \\"Make Your Mind Up\\". Chairlift went on their first international tour, opening for bands like Phoenix, The Killers, and MGMT. Pfenning left Chairlift in 2010 to pursue his solo career in Rewards. On September 7, 2011 they released the video to their single \\"Amanaemonesia\\" from their second album Something. For their 2012 single \\"Met Before\\" Chairlift created an interactive, choose-your-own-adventure video that Buzzfeed awarded the number one spot on its \\"23 Best Music Videos of 2012\\" end-of-year round up. Their sophomore album Something released via Columbia Records on January 24, 2012. Something features production from Dan Carey and Alan Moulder. After the record was released in Japan, Polachek co-directed a video for a Japanese version of \\"I Belong In Your Arms\\" with director/animator Eric Epstein. Through the time Polachek was finishing her solo record Arcadia, Chairlift continued working on their third record, Moth. Moth was released January 22, 2016 and featured 10 new songs, including the single \\"Ch-Ching\\". In December 2016, Chairlift announced that they would be breaking up, with a final tour in the spring of 2017. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:12em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:16em;\\" Details ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"9\\" Peak chart positions - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" US ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" US Heat ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" US Rock ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" US Indie ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" AUS ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" BEL (FL) Heat ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" BEL (FL) Alt. ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" UK ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" UK Indie - ! scope=\\"row\\" Does You Inspire You  * Released: September 11, 2008 * Label: Kanine Records * Formats:  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" Something  * Released: January 24, 2012 * Label: Kanine, Columbia Records, Young Turks * Formats:  184  5  47  29  45  3  38  131  15 - ! scope=\\"row\\" Moth  * Released: January 22, 2016 * Label: Columbia Records * Formats:  —  7  32  —  —  —  —  —  — } ===EPs=== * Daylight Savings EP – self-released, June 2007 * Chairlift at 6:15 – Young Turks, Kanine, October 2012 ===Singles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + List of singles as lead artist, with selected chart positions and certifications, showing year released and album name ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:14em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:1em;\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"width:1em;\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:8em;\\" Album - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:2.8em;font-size:90%;\\" US Bub. ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" AUS Bruises: http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20081120-0000/issue973.pdf ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\\" BEL (FL) Tip ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" CAN ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" GER Bruises: https://www.offiziellecharts.de/titel-details-511364 ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" MEX Air. ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\\" UK - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Evident Utensil\\"  2007  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  rowspan=\\"2\\" Does You Inspire You - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Bruises\\"  2008  1  72  5  80  63  34  50 - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Always Crashing in the Same Car\\"  2010  —  —  —  —  —  48  —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Amanaemonesia\\"  2011  —  —  —  —  —  48  —  rowspan=\\"4\\" Something - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Met Before\\"  rowspan=\\"4\\" 2012  —  —  —  —  —  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"I Belong in Your Arms\\"  —  —  —  —  —  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Ghost Tonight\\"  —  —  35  —  —  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"I Belong in Your Arms\\" (Japanese version)  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Ch- Ching\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" 2015  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  rowspan=\\"3\\" Moth - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Romeo\\"  —  —  —  —  —  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Crying in Public\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\" 2016  —  —  —  —  —  —  — - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Ch-Ching (Redux)\\" (featuring DRAM and Jimi Tents)  —  —  —  —  —  —  —  rowspan=\\"2\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Get Real\\"  —  —  —  —  —  —  — -  colspan=\\"14\\" style=\\"font-size:90%\\" \\"—\\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. } ===Remixes=== * Glasser – \\"Apply (Chairlift Remix)\\" (2012) * Phoenix – \\"Fences (Chairlift Remix)\\" (2012) * Indochine – \\"College Boy (Chairlift Remix)\\" (2013) ==ReferencesVideo: Exclusive live video on Punkrockvids.com * New band of the day: Chairlift in guardian.co.uk * Video: Evident Utensil * June 2009 Interview with L.A.

In the Central Mexican area, there were three races: the medium-sized furred dog (itzcuintli), the medium-sized hairless dog (xoloitzcuintli), and the short-legged, (tlalchichi) based in Colima and now extinct. Apart from other, more obvious functions, dogs were also used for food (10% of all consumed meat in Teotihuacan) and ritual sacrifice. ==Maya used domesticated dogs== The ancient Mayans, a group of people who lived throughout southern Mexico and Central America, used domesticated dogs on a daily basis as a food source, hunting aide, and an element in religious and spiritual rituals. ==Archaeological evidence== Remains of dogs have been found in sites dating from the Preclassic through the Postclassic periods of Mesoamerica dating as early as 1200 BCE. These remains have appeared in middens, spread over yard surfaces, and near areas of sacrificial offerings. Since the deposits of dogs were discovered along with other plant and animal remains, it is difficult to decipher dog parts from those of other small mammals. In Colha, Belize, dog foot bones and teeth were found more than any other body part. ==Uses of dogs== Despite the fact that the amount of dog use varied throughout time and place, people of the coastal regions of the Maya area placed more importance on dogs due to their constant availability as a source of protein and their ability to rapidly reproduce. Breeding and raising domesticated dogs required low energy use. Fish and other hunted animals were not as reliable as dogs as a food resource, and it required more energy and time to capture these animals for consumption. Overall, it is because of the comparison of dog deposits to other fauna and how the amount of dog deposits differs among sites from various periods. Because of this variation, it is not certain if the function of dogs altered from a food source to that of a religious symbol over time. Besides becoming a meal, dogs were also used as hunting and traveling companions and were scavengers in the home. ===Dogs as food=== During a portion of the Preclassic and Early Classic period (1200 BCE through 250 CE), dogs in Cuello, Belize were bred and killed once they reached one year of age. Dog bones had completed epiphyseal fusion and did not indicate the normal pattern of wear like adult dogs who lived longer than a year. Puppy remains were not found. Dogs were castrated and fed maize until they were fat enough to be ready for slaughter. Throughout the Preclassic period in the Yucatán region, dogs were not the primary meat supply, but archaeological evidence indicates they were a substantial part of the Maya diet. In fact, at the Colha site, white-tailed deer accounted for up to fifty percent of the Maya meat source. Starting in the Preclassic period, Maya elites served dogs during competitive feasts. They were either stewed or were burned in a sacrificial ceremony. Bones were chopped, broken, crushed and boiled to extract the marrow inside. ===Dog nutrition=== In addition to eating maize, dogs ate household scraps. There is no evidence for any kind of specialized diet for dogs. Today, the Yucatec Maya continue to talk about their dog-eating ancestors and carry on the tradition of feeding dogs maize by giving them six to eight tortillas daily. ===Breeds of dog=== Contemporary Maya have nine words for \\"dog\\" in their lexicon, not all of which correspond to separate breeds. It was documented in the sixteenth century by Spanish explorers in Mérida, Yucatán that dogs were bred locally in pens, fed maize, and sold at market. Another type of dog recognized by Maya was the hairless xoloitzcuintli, however, breeds are difficult to recognize archaeologically. ==Dogs in Maya culture and religionDogs in Maya literature=== In the Popol Vuh, the K'iche' Maya creation story, dogs played important roles in certain events. For example, the second attempt at creating humans turned disastrous when the gods made them out of wood. The wooden humans were emotionless and would not feed the dogs. In retaliation, the dogs became angry and destroyed them. The moral of the story is “civilized” Maya make certain that dogs are fed on a decent human diet such as maize. When dogs were used in ritual sacrifices, the act contained a dual meaning: a person gave respect to the dog by feeding it maize, which represent humans. Humans were made of maize by the gods in the Popol Vuh. Another account in the Popol Vuh describes the Hero twins sacrificing a dog that belonged to the Lords of the Underworld, also known as Xibalba. After the dog was dead, the Hero Twins brought it back to life. The Lords were so impressed that they asked the twins to sacrifice and resurrect them. In the end, the Hero Twins sacrificed the Lords of Xibalba and did not follow through on bringing them back to life. This made it possible for humans to live on earth. The story linked dogs with renewal and human life. Dogs are associated with death and have the job of leading people into the Underworld. They represent fire and are protectors of the hearth, two components of Maya life. ===Dog sacrifice and burial=== There are multiple situations in which dogs were used for sacrifice or burial. Dog sacrifices were important in the political sphere for rituals concerning “...inaugurations and founding of new civic religious centres...” There has also been confirmation of dog burials in Cozumel used in circumstances involving administration. Dogs were associated with “new beginnings\\" and were sacrificed instead of humans on the New Year ceremony. Dogs with spots that looked like the color of cacao were sacrificed during cacao rituals because they represented economic significance. Landmarks linked to fertility and ancestor worship contain dog burials. Dogs were found buried alongside humans in graves as well as in royal residences, presumably to guide their owners to the afterlife. ===Dogs in Maya art=== In Maya art, dogs are represented in various roles and media. They have been depicted in scenes such as those from the Popol Vuh or burial processions. The Maya Vase Database exhibits a great example of a possible funeral procession on a painted vase, K5534. The dog standing below the head noble's palanquin may be guiding its owner to Xibalba. In picture K555, another vase painting shows a scene from the Popol Vuh with Dog asking Itzamná to return to Xibalba. In addition to paintings, artists created clay figurines to resemble dogs, K8235. ==See also== *Abejas Phase *Native American dogs ==Works cited== *Clutton-Brock, J. \\"Hot dogs: comestible canids in Preclassic Maya culture at Cuello, Belize.\\" Journal of Archaeological Science. 21.6 (1994): 819. *Kerr, Justin. \\"The Last Journey: Reflections on the Ratinlinxul Vase and others of the same theme.\\" Maya Vase Data Base. 17 Sept. 2008. . *Masson, Marilyn A. \\"Animal Resource Manipulation in Ritual and Domestic Contexts at Postclassic Maya Communities.\\" World Archaeology. 31.1 (1999): 93-120. *White, Christine D. \\"Isotopic evidence for Maya patterns of deer and dog use at Preclassic Colha.\\" Journal of Archaeological Science. 28.1 (2001): 89. ===Bibliography=== *Beyer, Herman. \\"The Symbolic Meaning of the Dog in Ancient Mexico.\\" American Anthropologist. 10.3 (1908): 419–422.

While relatively few documents (or codices) of the Mixtec and Aztec cultures of the Post- Classic period survived the Spanish conquest, more progress has been made in the area of Mayan archaeology and epigraphy. Human presence in the Mexican region was once thought to date back 40,000 years based upon what were believed to be ancient human footprints discovered in the Valley of Mexico, but after further investigation using radioactive dating, it appears this is untrue. It is currently unclear whether 21,000-year-old campfire remains found in the Valley of Mexico are the earliest human remains in Mexico.\\"Native Americans\\", Encarta Indigenous peoples of Mexico began to selectively breed maize plants around 8000 BC. Evidence shows a marked increase in pottery working by 2300 B.C. and the beginning of intensive corn farming between 1800 and 1500 B.C.. Between 1800 and 300 BC, complex cultures began to form. Many matured into advanced pre-Columbian Mesoamerican civilizations such as the: Olmec, Izapa, Teotihuacan, Maya, Zapotec, Mixtec, Huastec, Purépecha, Totonac, Toltec, and Aztec, which flourished for nearly 4,000 years before the first contact with Europeans. ==Accomplishments== An image of one of the pyramids in the upper level of Yaxchilán These civilizations are credited with many inventions and advancements including pyramid-temples, mathematics (such as the development of the concept of zero as early as 36 BCE and working with sums of hundreds of millions), astronomy (measuring the length of the solar year to a high degree of accuracy), medicine, and theology. Archaic inscriptions on rocks and rock walls all over northern Mexico (especially in the state of Nuevo León) demonstrate an early propensity for counting in Mexico. These very early and ancient count-markings were associated with astronomical events and underscore the influence that astronomical activities had upon Mexican natives, even before they possessed urbanization. In fact, many of the later Mexican-based civilizations would carefully build their cities and ceremonial centers according to specific astronomical events. Astronomy and the notion of human observation of celestial events would become central factors in the development of religious systems, writing systems, fine arts, and architecture. Prehistoric Mexican astronomers began a tradition of precise observing, recording, and commemorating astronomical events that later become a hallmark of Mexican civilized achievements. Cities would be founded and built on astronomical principles, leaders would be appointed on celestial events, wars would be fought according to solar-calendars, and a complex theology using astronomical metaphors would organize the daily lives of millions of people. At some different points in time, three Mexican cities (Teotihuacan, Tenochtitlan, and Cholula) were among the largest cities in the world. These cities and several others blossomed as centers of commerce, ideas, ceremonies, and theology. In turn, they radiated influence outward into neighboring cultures in central Mexico. == Aridoamerica and Oasisamerica == At its height, Aridoamerica covered part of the present-day Mexican states of Chihuahua, Sonora, and Baja California, while Oasisamerica as the U.S. states of Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, and parts of California. Cultural groups that flourished in Aridoamerica, mostly within the borders of modern-day Mexico include the Mogollon, Patayan, and Hohokam. These two cultural regions maintained long-distance trade networks with Mesoamerica, evidenced by cacao, macaws, and other Mesoamerican goods found in Ancestral Pueblo sites, and turquoise from Oasisamerica found in precontact Mesoamerican artwork. For example, in Paquimé, a site connected to the Mogollon culture, there have been found ceremonial structures related to Mesoamerican religion, similar to the juego de pelota. ==Mesoamerica== While many city-states, kingdoms, and empires competed with one another for power and prestige, Mexico can be said to have had seven major civilizations: The Olmec, Teotihuacan, the Toltec, the Aztec, Zapotec, Mixtec, and the Maya. These civilizations (with the exception of the politically fragmented Maya) extended their reach across Mexico, and beyond, like no others. They consolidated power and distributed influence in matters of trade, art, politics, technology, and theology. Other regional power players made economic and political alliances with these seven civilizations over the span of 3,000 years. Many made war with them. But almost all found themselves within these seven spheres of influence. ===Olmec civilization=== Olmec colossal head 1, at Jalapa. The Olmec were an ancient Pre-Columbian people living in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, roughly in what are the modern-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Their immediate cultural influence, however, extends far beyond this region. The Olmec flourished during the Formative (or Preclassic) period, dating from 1400 BCE to about 400 BCE, and are believed to have been the progenitor civilization of later Mesoamerican civilizations. ===Teotihuacan civilization=== View of Avenue of the Dead from Pyramid of the Moon The decline of the Olmec resulted in a power vacuum in Mexico. Emerging from that vacuum was Teotihuacan, first settled in 300 B.C. By AD 150, it had grown to become the first true metropolis of what is now called North America. Teotihuacan established a new economic and political order never before seen in Mexico. Its influence stretched across Mexico into Central America, such as Monte Albán, Cerro de las Mesas, Matacapan, Tikal, and Kaminaljuyú. Teotihuacan's influence over the Maya civilization cannot be overstated; it transformed political power, artistic depictions, and the nature of economics. Within the city of Teotihuacan was a diverse and cosmopolitan population. Most of the regional ethnicities of Mexico were represented in the city. They lived in rural apartment communities where they worked their trades and contributed to the city's economic and cultural prowess. By AD 500, Teotihuacan had become one of the largest cities in the world with a population of 100,000 people. Teotihuacan's economic pull impacted areas in northern Mexico as well. It was a city whose monumental architecture reflected a new era in Mexican civilization, declining in political power about AD 650, but lasting in cultural influence for the better part of a millennium, to around AD 950. ===Maya civilization=== Mayan architecture at Uxmal Contemporary with Teotihuacan's greatness was the greatness of the Mayan civilization. The period between 250 and 650 CE saw an intense flourishing of Maya civilized accomplishments. While the many Maya city-states never achieved political unity on the order of the central Mexican civilizations, they exerted a tremendous intellectual influence upon Mexico. The Maya built some of the most elaborate cities on the continent, and made innovations in mathematics, astronomy, and writing that became the pinnacle of Mexico's scientific achievements. ===Toltec civilization=== Tollan (Tula), Hidalgo Just as Teotihuacan had emerged from a power vacuum, so too did the Toltec civilization, which took the reins of cultural and political power in Mexico from about 700. The Toltec empire established contact as far south as Central America, and as far north as the Anasazi corn culture in the Southwestern United States. The Toltec established a prosperous turquoise trade route with the northern civilization of Pueblo Bonito, in modern-day New Mexico. The Mayan city of Chichen Itza was also in contact with the Toltec civilization were powerfully influenced by central Mexicans as noted by the use of the Chac Mool, Atlantean figures, feathered serpents, and skull platforms. The Toltecs were about to melt and work precious metals such as gold and silver, they cultivated maguey and produced both pulque and clothes from the plant, and they were the employed cocoa beans in trade. The Toltec political system was so influential, that many future Mesoamerican dynasties would later claim to be of Toltec descent. ===Aztec civilization=== With the decline of the Toltec civilization came political fragmentation in the Valley of Mexico, and into this new game of political contenders for the Toltec throne stepped outsiders: the Aztec. Newcomers to the Valley of Mexico, they were seen as crude and unrefined in the eyes of the existing Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the fallen Toltec empire. Florentine Codex. Latecomers to Mexico's central plateau, the Aztecs thought of themselves as heirs to the prestigious civilizations that had preceded them, much as Charlemagne did with respect to the fallen Roman Empire. What the Aztecs lacked in political power, they made up for with ambition and military skill. In 1428, the Aztecs led a war of liberation against their rulers from the city of Azcapotzalco, which had subjugated most of the Valley of Mexico's peoples. The revolt was successful, and the Aztecs, through cunning political maneuvers and ferocious fighting skills, managed to pull off a true \\"rags-to-riches\\" story: they became the rulers of central Mexico as the leaders of the Triple Alliance. This Alliance was composed of the city-states of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan. At their peak, 300,000 Aztecs presided over a wealthy tribute-empire comprising 4 to 7 million people and extended into Central America. The westward expansion of the empire was stopped cold by a devastating military defeat at the hands of the Purépecha (who possessed state-of-the-art copper-metal weapons). The empire relied upon a system of taxation (of goods and services) which were collected through an elaborate bureaucracy of tax collectors, courts, civil servants, and local officials who were installed as loyalists to the Triple Alliance (led by Tenochtitlan). The empire was primarily economic in nature, and the Triple Alliance grew very rich: libraries were built, monumental architecture was constructed, and a highly prestigious artistic and priestly class was cultivated. All of this created a \\"First World\\" aura of invincibility around the island-city of Tenochtitlan. Unlike the later Spanish, the Aztecs did not seek to \\"convert\\" or destroy the cultures they conquered. Quite the opposite: the engines of warfare and empire in Central Mexico required that all participants understand and accept common cultural \\"rules\\" in order to make the flow of imperial wealth as smooth as possible. The rules of empire in Mexico were old rules, understood by all the power players and \\"contenders to the throne,\\" as had been shown many times before (the kingdom of Tlaxcala would attempt its own power grab in 1519 by using the Spanish as mercenary-allies). By 1519, the Aztec capital, Mexico-Tenochtitlan, was among the largest cities in the world with a population of around 300,000 (although some estimates range as high as 500,000). Beijing at the same time had a population variously estimated to be 670,000 up to one million people. By comparison, the population of Venice, the largest city in Europe in 1519, was 100,000 people. Tenochtitlan is the site of modern-day Mexico City. ===Allies of the Aztecs=== In the formation of the Triple Alliance empire, the Aztecs established several ally states. Among them were Cholula (the site of an early massacre by Spaniards), Texcoco (the site of a major library, subsequently burned by the Spanish), Tlacopan, and Matatlan. Also, many of the kingdoms conquered by the Aztecs provided soldiers for further imperial campaigns such as: Culhuacan, Xochimilco, Tepeacac, Amecameca, Coaixtlahuacan, Cuetlachtlan, Ahuilizipan. The Aztec war machine would become multi-ethnic, comprising soldiers from conquered areas, led by a large core of Aztec warriors and officers. This same strategy would later be employed by the Spaniards. == Recent discoveries == In May 2020, discovery of remains of at least sixty mammoths (included male, famele, young mammoths) and 15 people were uncovered by the National Institute of Anthropology and History headed by archaeologist Sánchez Nava under the Mexico City Santa-Lucia airport site named Zumpango, in the former Lake Xaltocan. According to the INAH, mammoth skeletons revealed in what used to be the shallow part of the lake were better anatomically preserved than those found in the deeper parts of the former lake. Mammoths probably got stuck in the lake and died. ==Legacy of the Aztecs== The Aztecs left a durable stamp upon modern Mexican culture. Much of what is considered modern Mexican culture derives from the Aztec civilization: place-names, words, food, art, dress, symbols, and even the name \\"Mexican\\". (See also Origin and history of the name \\"Mexico-Tenochtitlan\\"). ===Mexico City as the capital=== Today, the Aztec's capital city of Mexico-Tenochtitlan survives in modern times as Mexico City, the capital of the modern nation of Mexico. Mexico City is the largest metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere (and fifth-largest in the world with 21.2 million inhabitants). In their haste to colonize, the Spanish initially retained much of the original layout of the city of Tenochtitlan, reflected today in the various city districts (barrios) and in the central precinct of the Zócalo (formerly the ceremonial center of Tenochtitlan). Many streets and boulevards lay along the same paths as the previous water canals of Tenochtitlan. Several pyramids and ruins have even remain unearthed within the urban sprawl of the city. Over the two centuries following the conquest, the lakes of the valley were drained, drastically changing the landscape. The former island city now was able to spread over a dry plain. Only small remnants of the old canal city remain, such as in the celebrated flower district of Xochimilco. Today, Mexico City incorporates almost 9 million people, whereas, in 1519, that number was 300,000. ===Food and cuisine=== Foods originating from Mexico Mexico is a Megadiverse country. As such, many ingredients commonly consumed by today's people worldwide originate from Mexico. The names of the various foods are originally from Nahuatl. Examples of such ingredients are: Chocolate, Tomato, Maize and Corn, Vanilla, Avocado, Guava, Chayote, Epazote, Camote, Jícama, Tejocote, Nopal, Huitlacoche, Zapote, Mamey zapote, many varieties of modern Beans. Mexican cuisine The majority of Mexico's cuisine are of indigenous origins and are based on the ingredients listed above: * corn enters in the composition of tortillas, tamales, pozole, enchiladas, chilaquiles, tostadas * avocado is the principal ingredient of guacamole * chocolate is used in mole and atole * agave is the basis of several drinks: tequila, mezcal, pulque * chili peppers add a spicy flavor to many dishes These foods continue to make up the core of Mexican cuisine today. ===Nahuatl language=== Because the Mexica spoke Nahuatl (the most common language at the time of Spanish arrival) their terms and names were widespread as descriptors of cities, regions, valleys, rivers, mountains, and many cultural objects. The Spanish used Nahuatl translators as they waged wars of conquest throughout Mexico and beyond. As a result, Nahuatl names were used as geographic identifiers as far away as Guatemala (e.g. \\"Utatlán\\" was Q’umarka’aj, becoming modern Santa Cruz de Quiché; \\"Guatemala\\" comes from Iximché, the capital of the kaqchiles) and Suchitlán in the northern state of Coahuila on the southern Texas border. Numerous words from the Nahuatl language are today interspersed within Mexican Spanish. These words are used to describe geography, foods, colloquialisms, and first names for people (e.g., Xochitl, \\"flower,\\" for females and Tenoch for males). Today, approximately 1.5 million people continue to speak the Nahuatl language. Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in learning Nahuatl by Spanish-speaking and English-speaking Mexicans at-large. Some Mexican-American activists have portrayed Nahuatl language as a path to claiming an identity that is not European-based or Anglo-derivative (i.e. \\"Hispanic\\", \\"Latino\\", or \\"American\\"). English words that derive from Nahuatl include \\"avocado\\", \\"chili\\", \\"tomato\\", \\"chocolate\\", and \\"coyote\\". ===Flag of Mexico=== While different standards and flags were used during the pre- Hispanic period, the viceroyalty, and the Mexican War of Independence, the modern flag has its origins in the flag of the Army of the Three Guarantees in 1821. Today it consists of a rectangle with a green stripe on the left (signifying the Independence Movement), a white stripe in the middle (originally signifying the purity of the Catholic faith), and a red stripe on the right (signifying the blood of the fighters). There is a coat of arms in the center. The coat of arms represents the legendary founding of the city of Tenochtitlan. According to legend, the gods had advised the Aztecs that they should establish their city when they saw an eagle, perched on a prickly pear tree, devouring a serpent; after years of wandering, they found such an eagle on an island in Lake Texcoco, in what was to become the main plaza of Mexico City. The flag has undergone several changes since 1821; the last was in 1968. ===Art and symbols=== Mexican art has inspired generations of Mexican-descent artists, both inside and outside of Mexico's modern borders. Images of pyramids, the \\"Aztec calendar\\", and armed indigenous warriors have been popular themes. Also popular have been zig-zag motifs (found on indigenous buildings and pottery) and the theological notion of The Four Directions (found among indigenous cultures across the Western Hemsiphere). In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in the ceremonies and art of the Day of the Dead. The art, architecture, and symbols of the Mexica civilization exert such a unique identity that they are commonly used in advertisements for tourism to Mexico. ===Urbanization=== For much of its history, the majority of Mexico's population lived an urban lifestyle: cities, towns, and villages. Only a fraction of the population was tribal and wandering. Most people were permanently settled, agriculturally based, and identified with an urban identity, as opposed to a tribal identity. Mexico has long been an urbanized land, which was graphically reflected in the writings of the Spaniards who encountered them. ==Notes== Category:History of Mexico Category:Prehistory of North America nl:Geschiedenis van Mexico#Precolumbiaanse Tijd ","title":"Pre-Columbian Mexico"},{"id":"19282435","text":"Saddam Hussein (1937-2006) was the 5th President of Iraq.

The film was directed by Andy Abrahams Wilson, who became interested in the subject after his sister identified as a \\"chronic Lyme\\" patient. The film had its theatrical premiere on June 19, 2009 at the IFC Center in New York City. == Misinformation == The film falsely argues that persistent infection with Lyme disease is responsible for a variety of debilitating symptoms. The film presents advocates of the position, including \\"chronic Lyme\\" pressure group International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS). The position is at odds with that of major medical bodies including the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Academy of Neurology, who do not recognize \\"chronic\\" Lyme disease as a legitimate diagnosis. The film portrays the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) as \\"an organization riddled with conflicts of interest,\\" and briefly discusses Richard Blumenthal's antitrust charges against the society. Blumenthal's accusations led to an independent review which fully vindicated the IDSA position.IDSA Final Report of the Lyme Disease Review Panel of the Infectious diseases Society of America == Synopsis == The film follows six individuals, including major league ball player Ben Petrick who report chronic symptoms, which they attribute to persistent Lyme infection. The majority of the film is devoted to the storyline of these patients and their reported recovery. At the same time, the film presents advocates of long-term therapies for chronic Lyme disease and briefly presents the position of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). The second half of the film focuses primarily on state medical board investigations of Joseph Jemsek and Ray Jones, two physicians who prescribe long-term antibiotics for chronic Lyme disease, a practice generally recognized to be dangerous and without provable benefit. Jemsek was investigated based on the complaints of 10 patients who described \\"nightmarish experiences\\" as a result of his treatment; he was supported by a number of patients and advocacy organizations. The board found that Jemsek had departed from standard medical practice and had failed to inform patients that his treatments were unorthodox; his medical license was suspended with stay, allowing him to continue practicing medicine. Facing a lawsuit from an insurance company, Jemsek declared bankruptcy and closed his medical practice. The final act of the film focuses on Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal's antitrust investigation of the IDSA Lyme disease guidelines. Blumenthal issued a press release in May 2008 stating that his investigation \\"uncovered serious flaws\\" in the development of the IDSA guidelines, although Blumenthal declined to file any charges. Under pressure of mounting legal fees, the IDSA agreed to submit its Lyme disease guidelines to an independent review, which supported the scientific validity of the IDSA guidelines. The expert panel's review was published in 2010, with the independent doctors and scientists in the panel unanimously endorsing the guidelines, stating \\"No changes or revisions to the 2006 Lyme guidelines are necessary at this time,\\" and concluding long-term antibiotic treatments are unproven and potentially dangerous. The case was described in Forbes as \\"intimidation\\" of the medical community by the Attorney General, and in JAMA as an example of \\"elected officials advocating for health policies against the weight of scientific evidence.\\" The film concludes with vignettes of two patients discussing their claimed recoveries. == Critical reception == The New York Times described the film as a \\"polemic\\" and \\"inflammatory.\\" Variety wrote that the film \\"sides with those advocating unconventional treatments, [but] gives gatekeepers from Infectious Diseases of America [sic, actually Infectious Diseases Society of America] their say.\\" The Baltimore Sun described it as \\"full of suspicions, assertions, and anecdotes; it’s low on science and objectivity\\". According to review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, as of December 2019, the film has received 26 positive reviews and 6 negative reviews for a score of 81% positive reviews from the site's approved critics; the average rating is 6.7/10.

Inventories are usually the largest current asset of a business, and proper measurement of them is necessary to assure accurate financial statements. If inventory is not properly measured, expenses and revenues cannot be properly matched and a company could make poor business decisions. == Inventory accounting system== The two most widely used inventory accounting systems are the periodic and the perpetual. * Perpetual: The perpetual inventory system requires accounting records to show the amount of inventory on hand at all times. It maintains a separate account in the subsidiary ledger for each good in stock, and the account is updated each time a quantity is added or taken out. * Periodic: In the periodic inventory system, sales are recorded as they occur but the inventory is not updated. A physical inventory must be taken at the end of the year to determine the cost of goods Regardless of what inventory accounting system is used, it is good practice to perform a physical inventory at least once a year. == Inventory valuation methods - perpetual == The perpetual system records revenue each time a sale is made. Determining the cost of goods sold requires taking inventory. The most commonly used inventory valuation methods under a perpetual system are: #first-in first-out (FIFO) #last-in first-out (LIFO) #highest in, first out (HIFO) #average cost or weighted average cost . These methods produce different results because their flow of costs are based upon different assumptions. The FIFO method bases its cost flow on the chronological order purchases are made, while the LIFO method bases it cost flow in a reverse chronological order. The average cost method produces a cost flow based on a weighted average of goods. == Periodic versus perpetual systems == There are fundamental differences for accounting and reporting merchandise inventory transactions under the periodic and perpetual inventory systems. To record purchases, the periodic system debits the Purchases account while the perpetual system debits the Merchandise Inventory account. To record sales, the perpetual system requires an extra entry to debit the Cost of goods sold and credit Merchandise Inventory. By recording the cost of goods sold for each sale, the perpetual inventory system alleviated the need for adjusting entries and calculation of the goods sold at the end of a financial period, both of which the periodic inventory system requires. In Perpetual Inventory System there must be actual figures and facts. == Using non-cost methods to value inventory == Under certain circumstances, valuation of inventory based on cost is impractical. If the market price of a good drops below the purchase price, the lower of cost or market method of valuation is recommended. This method allows declines in inventory value to be offset against income of the period. When goods are damaged or obsolete, and can only be sold for below purchase prices, they should be recorded at net realizable value. The net realizable value is the estimated selling price less any expense incurred to dispose of the good. == Methods used to estimate inventory cost == In certain business operations, taking a physical inventory is impossible or impractical. In such a situation, it is necessary to estimate the inventory cost. Two very popular methods are 1)- retail inventory method, and 2)- gross profit (or gross margin) method. The retail inventory method uses a cost to retail price ratio. The physical inventory is valued at retail, and it is multiplied by the cost ratio (or percentage) to determine the estimated cost of the ending inventory. The gross profit method uses the previous years average gross profit margin (i.e. sales minus cost of goods sold divided by sales). Current year gross profit is estimated by multiplying current year sales by that gross profit margin, the current year cost of goods sold is estimated by subtracting the gross profit from sales, and the ending inventory is estimated by adding cost of goods sold to goods available for sale. ==External links== * Financial Accounting Course * Comparison of Different Methods Category:Costs Category:Management accounting Category:Inventory ","title":"Inventory valuation"},{"id":"19282727","text":"Édouard Berth (1875–1939) was a theorist of French syndicalism and disciple of Georges Sorel.

Merced has a deep and long-standing animosity with the Atwater High School Falcons, both in sports and in academics. As the city of Merced grew, so did its student population, forcing the freshmen to be bussed to a different area of the city known as \\"East Campus\\" in order to adequately fit them all. This eventually drove the city to develop plans for a second city high school, Golden Valley High. Until the new school's opening, the main rival for the Merced Bears was the Atwater Falcons. However, the opening of Golden Valley prompted a split in districting of Merced, and nearly half of the first-year students at the new campus were from Merced High. Since then a great competition between \\"old school\\" and \\"new school\\" has sprung up, and Atwater has fallen into a close second-rival for both city schools. ==The Netherlands== In 2010 the school visited the Stedelijk Dalton lyceum for an interchange project, in Dordrecht in the Netherlands. They were there from 6–9 April, and visited the school, Amsterdam, the windmill of Kinderdijk, and Paris in France. ==See also== *Buhach Colony High School *Livingston High School *Los Banos High School *Merced High School ==References *Golden Valley High School website *Merced Union High School District website Category:High schools in Merced County, California Category:Public high schools in California ","title":"Golden Valley High School (Merced, California)"},{"id":"19282972","text":"This is a list of members of the House of Commons of Canada in the 38th Parliament of Canada (October 4, 2004 to November 29, 2005). *Bold text denotes cabinet ministers *Italic text denotes party leaders ==Members== {  - Conservative - Liberal - Bloc Québécois - New Democratic - Independent } ===Alberta=== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" width=\\"610\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse\\" - bgcolor=\\"CCCCCC\\" !

SLGs are of interest in fields like Kolmogorov complexity, Lossless data compression, Structure discovery and Compressed data structures. The problem of finding a context-free grammar (equivalently: an SLG) of minimal size that generates a given string is called the smallest grammar problem. Straight-line grammars (more precisely: straight-line context-free string grammars) can be generalized to Straight-line context-free tree grammars. The latter can be used conveniently to compress trees. ==Formal Definition== A context-free grammar G is an SLG if: 1\\\\. for every non-terminal N, there is at most one production rule that has N as its left-hand side, and 2\\\\. the directed graph G=, defined by V being the set of non-terminals and (A,B) ∈ E whenever B appears at the right-hand side of a production rule for A, is acyclic. A mathematical definition of the more general formalism of straight-line context-free tree grammars can be found in Lohrey et al. An SLG in Chomsky normal form is equivalent to a straight-line program. == A list of algorithms using SLGs == * The Sequitur algorithm constructs a straight-line grammar for a given string. * The Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm creates a context-free grammar in such a deterministic way that it is necessary to store only the start rule of the generated grammar. * Byte pair encoding ==See also== * Grammar-based code * Non-recursive grammar - a grammar that doesn't loop, but may branch; generating a finite rather than a singleton language ==References== Category:Formal languages ","title":"Straight-line grammar"},{"id":"19283000","text":"Harrison Island is a northern Canadian uninhabited island in eastern Hudson Bay.

It is one of the oldest yacht clubs in Spain. This club is located at one end of the Port of Tarragona. It is a well-equipped yacht club, with its own yacht harbor as well as an adjacent area housing the club's premises, a locally well-known Sailing School, as well as a restaurant and cafeteria. The club's harbor has a 500 m2 mooring area. The Reial Club Nàutic de Tarragona has participated in many sailing competitions during its long existence. It has also won a great number of awards. ==History== The Royal Tarragona Yacht Club was established in 1878. In the beginning it was locally known as \\"Club dels Xiflats\\" (\\"Club of the Dim-witted\\" in Catalan), for at that time no one in this harbor town understood why the club's first members would engage for pleasure in rowing and sailing, the arduous task of sailors and fishermen. The RCNT's first building was destroyed during a seasonal flood of the Francolí River in 1917. Following its reconstruction the building was badly damaged by bombs during the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War, after which it was only repaired in 1945. In the 1960s the club opened its Escola de Marineria, a Sailing School which quickly earned a good reputation for promoting interest in water sports among the youth in Tarragona. During the last decades of the 20th century the Royal Tarragona Yacht Club expanded quickly thanks to the assistance of the Tarragona Port Authority in the construction of its new harbor premises outside of the heavily-polluted commercial harbor. The new RCNT building was inaugurated by the King of Spain, in 1997. The Royal Tarragona Yacht Club celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2003 amid much fanfare among its members and local authorities.RCNT website ==References External links == * website Tarragona Category:1878 establishments in Spain Category:Tarragonès Category:Organisations based in Spain with royal patronage ","title":"Royal Tarragona Yacht Club"},{"id":"19283025","text":"Alexander Charles, Duke of Anhalt-Bernburg (2 March 1805 - 19 August 1863) was a German prince of the House of Ascania.

During his career, he served as the translator for Neville Chamberlain's negotiations with Adolf Hitler over the Munich Agreement, the British Declaration of War and the surrender of France. ==Early years== In 1917 and 1918, Schmidt was a soldier in the First World War and was wounded on the Western Front. Later, he studied modern languages in Berlin and worked at the same time for an American newspaper agency. In 1921, he took courses in the Foreign Office for the training of conference interpreters. Schmidt distinguished himself there by virtue of his outstanding memory. In July 1923, Schmidt, still preparing for examinations, accepted his first assignment for the translating and interpreting service of the Foreign Office at the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Hague. He married in 1925 and had a son the following year. ==Foreign Office== Paul Schmidt, (center) interpreting between Philippe Pétain and Adolf Hitler, October 1940. The Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop stands in the background to the right. After more language study in Berlin, Schmidt worked briefly in the Reich Foreign Language Office. Starting in 1924, he worked as an interpreter in the Foreign Office. Schmidt interpreted during the Locarno Treaty meetings (1925) and participated in many other important international conferences. He served as an interpreter at the League of Nations (1926-1933) and at the London Economic Conference in 1933. Under Reich Chancellor Gustav Stresemann, Schmidt became chief interpreter, a position that he retained after Hitler came to power in 1933. Schmidt remained chief interpreter until 1945. At the Munich Conference, he interpreted between Hitler and Neville Chamberlain and Édouard Daladier. Benito Mussolini was fluent in French but spoke a somewhat fractured, mangled German. Although Mussolini was not as good at German as he pretended to be, he always refused the use of a translator at his meetings with Hitler because of his vainglorious pride. During the war years, he served as Hitler's interpreter during his meetings with Marshal Philippe Pétain and General Francisco Franco. On 12 June 1941, Schmidt served as the translator for the summit between Hitler and General Ion Antonescu of Romania. Antonescu was fluent in French (interwar Romania was such a Francophile nation that fluency in French was de rigueur if one wanted to advance socially), but Hitler spoke no language other than German.Ancel, Jean The History of the Holocaust in Romania, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2011 page 214. At the summit, Antonescu spoke in French and had his remarks translated into German by Schmidt, who also translated Hitler's remarks into French (Schmidt knew no Romanian). During the course of the meeting, Hitler, via Schmidt, informed Antonescu of the planned \\"war of extermination\\" that Operation Barbarossa was intended to be and asked that Anonescu set up a Romanian equivalent of the Einsatzgruppen, a request that Antonescu agreed to. The Israeli historian Jean Ancel wrote sarcastically about Schmidt's post-1945 claim to be a mere \\"extra on the stage of history\\" that Schmidt was surely being too modest here in downplaying his role at the Hitler-Antonescu summit that led to the murder of hundreds of thousands of Jews. Schmidt fails to mention the genocidal plans discussed in the Hitler- Antonescu meetings but gives the misleading impression that German-Romanian talks during the war were entirely concerned with military and economic matters. After the 1942 Dieppe Raid resulted in thousands of Canadian soldiers captured, Schmidt was in charge of their interrogations. Schmidt joined the NSDAP in 1943.Zenter, Christian and Bedürftig, Friedemann (1991). Encyclopedia of the Third Reich, p. 839. New York: Macmillan. ==Postwar== Arrested in May 1945, Schmidt was freed by the Americans in 1948. In 1946 he testified at the Nuremberg Trials, where conversations with him were noted down by psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn and later published. In 1947, he testified for the prosecution against the directors of IG Farben. In 1952 he founded the Sprachen & Dolmetscher Institut in Munich, a college in which students could learn languages and become translators and interpreters. He retired in 1967. ==Memoirs== Entitled An Extra on the Diplomatic Stage, Schmidt's memoirs cover his 21 years as an important eyewitness to European foreign policy. They begin with his frontline experiences during the First World War at the German Spring Offensive of 1918 and continue with his work for the German chancellors before 1933. The English edition of the book, Hitler’s Interpreter , skips that material and describes only the Hitler years, (1933-1945). The memoirs present an atmospheric but detailed portrait of the highest level of the Third Reich. He has this advice for interpreters in training: \\"Over the years I have arrived at the conviction that a good diplomatic interpreter must possess three characteristics: Most important, he must, paradoxically, be able to be silent; he must be expert in the subject he is translating; and only in third place is his mastery of the language he translates\\". ==ReferencesSources== * * *Goldensohn, Leon N., and Gellately, Robert (ed.): The Nuremberg Interviews, Alfred A.

He was mentioned as a potential gubernatorial candidate in 2010, but declined to run. ==Early life and education== Mike Dow was born in South Carolina and was raised as a foster child. He had a troubled childhood. His father left his family when he was ten and his mother suffered from mental illness. As a consequence Mike became a ward of the state. Later at about the age of fourteen, he was taken in by his maternal grandfather, Henry Gainous. Dow joined the U. S. Army, serving as a paratrooper in his first tour of duty and as a door gunner for subsequent tours. He survived several helicopter crashes, but in the fourth one, his pilot and best friend, Johnny Legg, was killed. Dow was following his friend in another helicopter; after Legg's death, Dow decided to leave the military. He still keeps a rubbing of Mr. Legg's name from the Vietnam memorial in his office. After leaving Vietnam and the military, Dow returned to college, earning a master's degree in accounting from the University of South Alabama. ==Business== In 1979, Dow co-founded QMS (Quality Micro Systems) with his brother-in-law, Jim Busby. Dow took on a variety of roles, serving as Vice President of Sales, Marketing, and Accounting for the company. Quality Micro Systems, a printer manufacturing company, at one time competed with giants like Hewlett Packard, Canon, Xerox, and Tektronix and was listed in the Fortune 500. Dow is credited with creating the company's European distribution network. After Black Monday, the company was forced to downsize and was eventually purchased by Minolta to become Minolta-QMS in 2000. Prior to this, Dow left QMS and entered electoral politics, joining the Democratic Party. He ran as a candidate in 1989 for city council from District 6. == Election of 1989 == From 1911 to the 1980s, the city had a city commission government, with commissioners elected at-large. It returned to a mayor-council government to provide more representation by a breadth of city voters. Arthur Outlaw was elected as mayor in 1985, for the first time since 1911 as a direct candidate, by a comfortable margin. He ran as a 'statesman' candidate, based on his having served terms on the city commission in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. During his term, he worked with the city's first directly elected council in 1987 to pass an historic 15-year master plan. It proposed construction of a convention center on the Mobile River to stimulate downtown development. Gradually opposition to the convention center mounted. Outlaw was affiliated with Spring Hill College and active in the Mobile Carnival Association (he was a member of the 1948 MCA court); he was considered to be part of the traditional Mobile establishment. During this period, he also served as Chairman of the Alabama Republican Party. (Municipal elections in Alabama are non-partisan.) Dow intended to run for City Council from District 6 in the southwestern portion of the city. Joe Bullard, who owned an auto dealership, was pondering his own run for the mayoralty. Early in the season, former mayor Lambert C. Mims was indicted for ethics violations while in office. He was considered the primary competitor to Outlaw. Mims suggested that Dow run for mayor, and said he would give him strong support from his base. At the urging of Bullard and Mims, businessman Dow decided to run for Mayor. He promoted himself as a new style candidate, reaching out to both black and white voters. Dow's campaign included a coalition of African-American ministers and he frequently attended mass at African-American churches throughout the city. He campaigned against the convention center. He won the election by a very convincing margin and his election suggested a shift in leadership in Mobile. Dow's victory was based on his support among middle-class white voters and African Americans. Outlaw carried the upper-class white vote. ==Mayoralty== During his early months in office, Dow demonstrated his interest in downtown redevelopment. Despite campaigning against the convention center, he began to support the project. Dow proposed what he called \\"The String of Pearls\\", a series of projects meant to help spur the redevelopment of downtown. He moved forward with both the strategies outlined in the 15-year plan of Outlaw, and the convention center. Dow dramatically increased capital spending, as well as the city's sales tax, raising it to 4%, giving Mobile an overall sales tax rate of 9%. During his first term, Dow worked with county leaders to secure the construction of Mobile Government Plaza, the first governmental structure in the United States to house both city and county governments. In 1993, Bess Rich was elected to the city council in District 6; Dow won re-election that year with more than 65% of the vote. Rich frequently questioned Dow's agenda of capital spending without a sustainable revenue source. Most of the city council supported him. When the Mobile BayBears team approached the city, Rich opposed the borrowing for construction of the stadium because she believed in allowing the public to vote on non-basic service capital projects. She also opposed the attention Dow gave to capital projects downtown, because of the increased debt load from borrowing it placed on the community with no thought to paying back the debt or obtaining funds to support maintenance of the projects. As a result of Dow's aggressive capital building program, the city was left with little money in its future budgets for basic capital needs. In 2001, Bess Rich gave him the strongest challenge for his office since his initial election in 1989. Another key feature of the Dow administration were attempts at annexation. The Mobile city limits, with the exception of a few areas, had largely been set with the mass annexation of 1956. At various times, Dow put forth proposals to annex parts of West Mobile and Tillman's Corner, but these failed. Dow was highly popular in the city, but not so in the suburbs. His support for expanded gambling in the state (and city) was opposed by many evangelical Protestants. belief that legalized gambling would be a boon for Mobile, and the fact that the casinos in Biloxi were drawing a large clientele from Mobile. Another concern of this area was their concern that Dow would increase their taxes as he did in the city. His terms as Mayor saw a general erosion of white support over time (though over time he picked up most of Outlaw's voters from 1989) while he steadily increased his support among black Mobilians. Dow cruised to re-election in 1997, and began to be mentioned as a gubernatorial candidate. During Dow's third term, downtown redevelopment continued. In 2001 Dow signed a deal with the Retirement Systems of Alabama to construct a skyscraper in downtown Mobile. The RSA Tower now towers over the city at 745 feet In 2001, Bess Rich, who had limited herself to two terms on the city council, decided to run for mayor. Rich challenged the mayor on the borrowing which the city had done. Dow won the election 61-39%, winning every district except Rich's own District 6, where he lost 55-45%. (By comparison, Rich had won that district with 70% of the vote in her re-election bid in 1997). In 2001 Charlie Waller and Mabin Hicks, Dow allies on the council, were replaced by Steve Nodine and Ben Brooks. Connie Hudson won in District 6 and the three formed an anti-Dow bloc on the city council. The main issues of his fourth term were an annexation of West Mobile which failed, a vote in West Mobile to incorporate it, which also failed, and the construction of the Alabama Cruise Ship Terminal on the waterfront, which added its second ship in August 2008. Dow also began actively courting Thyssen-Krupp, which was surveying sites for a steel mill, and Boeing, which was investigation sites for manufacturing their Dreamliner plane. During the course of Dow's fourth term, crime in Mobile continued to drop. His popularity began to rise as people saw the results of investment in downtown Mobile. It was also during his fourth term that the proposed \\"Mardi Gras Park\\" was approved, in a deal with the Mobile County Commission. === Controversies ===  Vietnam Flag  Mobile Government Plaza contains displays in the atrium in which there are displays of flags. One contains a rostrum of American state flags, one a rostrum of international flags. During Dow's third term, it was found that the flag representing the nation of Vietnam was the flag that had been used by the Saigon government of South Vietnam. Because Dow is a veteran of the Vietnam War, a minor controversy arose concerning whether or not he had made the decision to supplant the flag of united Vietnam with the flag of South Vietnam. The flag was changed to the correct one and it has become a largely forgotten part of his administration. Changing of the Mobile City Seal The Mobile City Seal, which had been in use for decades, contained the six national flags (excluding the Republic of West Florida) that have flown over the city during its history. One of those governments was the Confederate States of America, and the city honored this by placing the Confederate Naval Jack on the seal. This seal was on police cars, marked city vehicles, historical markers, and a battle flag was flown at Government Plaza along with the other national flags. The city's African-American councilmen began pushing for a change in the seal to the First National Flag, which garnered outrage from Confederate heritage groups. The first vote before the council reached no conclusion, with black members voting for the first national, Bess Rich voting for the second national, another councilman voting for the third national and Reggie Copeland and Mabin Hicks voting to keep the seal as it was. After a considerable amount of controversy, a compromise was made, wherein the city dropped the battle flag from the seal, replacing it with the Third National Flag. Cuba It was during the Dow administration that Mobile established formal sister city relations with Havana, Cuba. Delegations from the Mobile-La Habana society took part in these trips and the Mayor went on several of them. This brought criticism from those who thought that Mobile shouldn't have been sending delegations to Cuba in light of the embargoes against the communist nation. However, the trips did establish links between officials in Mobile and officials in Havana that could be useful when trade is restored between the United States and Cuba. ===Election of 2005=== In early 2005, Dow called a morning news conference in which he announced that he was not going to run for a fifth term. He stayed out of the campaign during the non-partisan first round primary. Three of the candidates ran as Dow supporters and people who would continue the Dow legacy: County Commissioner Samuel L. Jones, City Councilman John Peavy (a Catholic), Bess Rich, the former city council member and community activist, and Republican former State Senator Ann Bedsole, whose bid to become governor of Alabama had ended in the 1994 Republican runoff election against former Governor Fob James because of opposition from pro-life groups who disapproved of her abortion stance. Bedsole had also sponsored a symbolic measure in the legislature calling for the secession of Mobile from Alabama. She also refused to endorse James in the 1994 general election, but he narrowly prevailed. The frontrunners were Jones, vying to become the city's first black mayor while keep issues of race off the table (at this date, the city's website doesn't even mention that he is the first black mayor), and Bedsole, one of the city's leading socialites, who boasted the largest campaign warchest in the race. In the first election, held on August 17, 2005, Jones nearly won it outright with 46% and Peavy placed second with approximately 37%. Both Ann Bedsole and Bess Rich received roughly 14% of the vote, however, given that three candidates were running on continuing the work of Dow, pro-Dow candidates combined polled 86% of the citywide vote, and the runoff was set between two Dow allies. In a surprise move, a few days before the election, Dow formally endorsed Sam Jones, and Jones went on to win the election with a 57-43% margin. Jones did not win over as many black voters as Dow had won, but he traded it off with gains in white voters from Dow's endorsement. Dow formally left office the first week of October 2005. ===Hurricane Katrina=== Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast two weeks after the non-partisan primary election and two weeks before the non-partisan runoff. Katrina actually determined the course of a city council race as an African-American incumbent used pictures from New Orleans tying the scenes of black victims of the storm to supporters of his opponents. It caused a backlash amongst white voters in the district and led to his defeat. The councilman, Thomas Sullivan, had been an ally of Dow while on the council, he was replaced with William Carroll, a black Catholic contractor who had played football for McGill-Toolen and had served as a staffer for Senator Howell Heflin. During Katrina, Mobile received hurricane-force winds and the worst surge it had seen since the Hurricane of 1916, with areas that hadn't flooded since being built upon flooding. Damage was heavy in the Dog River area, and among the numerous creeks and culverts that cross through the city. It was also responsible for heavy flooding downtown. Dow was at the press conference that Bush held at Mobile Regional Airport in which the lines \\"heck of a job, Brownie\\" were uttered. Dow can be recognized in the footage through his short stature, gray hair and mustache. Because it hit at the end of his term, Hurricane Katrina did not have much of an impact on the overall legacy of Dow, as this work went to his successor in the mayor's office, Samuel L. Jones. ==Post-mayoral career== After stepping down from office, Dow went to work for his brother-in-law, this time for the CentraLite venture. He also became involved with the effort to create the Alabama Motorsports Park on a site located north of Mobile. Dow helped gain a site in Mobile County over a possible site in Baldwin County. Dow serves as a member of the board of the track venture. ===Political affiliation and future=== Dow worked to keep party politics out of city government. By the end of his term, he was supported by a coalition on the city council of white Republicans, representing middle and upper-class voters, and black Democrats. His opposition consisted of white Republicans who appeared to rely on working-class whites for support. The cross-party coalitions developed in the non-partisan elections. ==References== Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:People from South Carolina Category:University of South Alabama alumni Category:Mayors of Mobile, Alabama Category:Alabama Independents Category:United States Army soldiers Category:Military personnel from Mobile, Alabama ","title":"Mike Dow"},{"id":"19283126","text":"Andy Bull is an Australian alt-pop singer-songwriter and producer, based in Sydney. He is best known for his singles \\"Dog\\", \\"Keep on Running\\" and \\"Baby I Am Nobody Now\\"; as well as his prolific Australian touring. Bull also provides the singing voice to animated character, Jay, in the Netflix original cartoon series Beat Bugs. ==Early years and We're Too Young== Bull began performing in and around Sydney in the early 2000s. He signed to Island Records, a part of Universal Music Australia, in 2007. He supported Joss Stone on her Australian tour later that year. Bull's debut single, \\"Small Town Girl,\\" was released in August 2008. It was also released as a part of a four-track self-titled EP; which featured three original songs and a cover of \\"A Man Needs a Maid\\" by Neil Young. Bull's debut album, We're Too Young, was released in August 2009. A music video was made for \\"Young Man,\\" the second single from the album. Bull toured extensively in support of the album throughout the rest of 2008 and 2009, notably joining Tim Finn's national tour as an opening act, performing solo. He also opened for a MySpace secret show in Sydney featuring Duffy that same year. In May 2009, Bull toured in support of Lisa Mitchell's Australian tour, prior to the July release of her debut album Wonder. During the tour, he performed his support set solo. For her own set, Mitchell was to play guitar, accompanied by bass player Jan Bangma and drummer Robert Vasey. Before the second show of the tour, however, Mitchell's hand was cut in an accident. Due to Mitchell's injury, she was unable to play guitar and so Bull stepped in, learning the set on piano in lieu of the guitar parts. He played in the band for the remainder of that tour, fomenting Bull and Mitchell's friendship, which would lead to their collaboration on Bull's song \\"Dog\\" the following year. ==2010–11: Phantom Pains== In 2010, Bull began writing new material after relocating to Surry Hills. He was inspired to record a duet with Lisa Mitchell after performing a cover of Madonna's \\"Like a Prayer\\" with her and Lanie Lane at Sydney's Enmore Theatre during Mitchell's headlining performance at the venue. The resulting song was \\"Dog\\". Its popularity resulted in being featured in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2010, charting at number 68. \\"Dog,\\" along with five other new songs, featured on Bull's Phantom Pains EP. He played piano, guitar and drums on the EP, as well as nearly all of the vocals. He was also joined by former Red Riders guitarist Adrian Deutsh and Deep Sea Arcade/Tim Finn drummer Carlos Adura, as well as Deep Sea Arcade bassist Nick Weaver. Along with Mitchell, the EP also featured special guests Little Red and Hungry Kids of Hungary as Bull's backing band on the songs \\"Nothing to Lose\\" and \\"Last Waltz,\\" respectively. A music video was made for the EP's title track, in which a man cuts off his thumb in order to get workplace compensation. The EP artwork was painted by Bull, and features a depiction of his left hand with a severed thumb. In October 2010, Bull joined Clare Bowditch's national tour for a series of stops as her opening act, joining Augie March frontman Glenn Richards. For these dates, he was joined by Slow Down Honey guitarist Alex Bennison. Bull and Bennison did a small headlining tour in the following weeks, and later joined Canadian singer-songwriter Dan Mangan on the New South Wales leg of his national tour in January 2011. He also headed out on a headlining tour of the east coast with Melbourne singer Owl Eyes, titled the Bulls Eye Tour, in February. Shortly after this, the second and final single from Phantom Pains was announced as \\"Last Waltz.\\" Bull, Bennison and new drummer Dave Jenkins, Jr. (also of Slow Down Honey, Young Romantics, Reece Mastin and Kirin J Callinan) visited the Triple J studios on 24 March 2011, to perform the song acoustically as a part of the station's \\"Like a Version\\" segment. The trio also performed a cover of Tears for Fears' \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World.\\" The segment and rendition were popularly received, and were later voted by a Triple J listener poll into the top five 'Like a Version' segments for 2011. On 28 February, Bull was a special guest on Channel 10 comedy panel show Good News Week. As one of the clues in deciphering a news story from the week, he performed a piano-based version of the Sex Pistols song \\"God Save the Queen.\\" In early March 2011, Bull was also a part of a campaign for Australian tourism called \\"Making Tracks,\\" in which he was paired with Taiwanese classical musician Irene Chan, from the YouTube Symphony Orchestra. The pair travelled to South Australia and the Northern Territory, in particular Kangaroo Island and Kings Canyon. The campaign involved a musical experiment, in which the two collaborated on a piece of music that reflected their journey. The video documentation of this has had over 100 thousand hits on YouTube. Following this tour, Bull was asked to join his friends Hungry Kids of Hungary on their final Australian tour in support of their debut album, Escapades. Each night of the tour would see Bull performing with his band, as well as performing \\"Last Waltz\\" with Hungry Kids of Hungary during their headlining sets. In June 2011, Bull played solo in support of Joshua Radin's Australian tour. In August/September 2011, Bull and his band headlined the official Phantom Pains tour of Australia, twelve months after The Phantom Pains EP was released.. The tour included sold out shows at Good God in Sydney; the Northcote Social Club in Melbourne and The Spiegltent in Brisbane (as part of the 2011 Brisbane Festival). In December 2011, Bull, Bennison and Jenkins performed at Your Festival in Newcastle, New South Wales, as well as three shows at the Woodford Folk Festival in Woodford, Queensland. At these shows, the trio performed a mix of new material and songs taken from Phantom Pains. ==2013–present: New singles and Sea of Approval== Bull's first new recorded material since the Phantom Pains EP came in early 2013. \\"Keep On Running\\" was premiered on Richard Kingsmill's new music show on Sunday, 24 February. Bull is credited with production, and all instruments but drums. A video was also released for the single, directed by Nelson Alves. In June 2013, Bull signed to US Record Label Republic Records. Another single. \\"Baby I Am Nobody Now,\\" was released in July 2013. Bull is credited with production and all instruments. A video was also released for the single, again directed by Nelson Alves. It features cameos from A Rational Fear creator Dan Ilic and Bluejuice frontman Jake Stone. The singles were toured throughout Australia. Bull's backing bands for these tours featured Bennison, Adura, Jenkins, Dappled Cities keyboardist Ned Cooke and former Hungry Kids of Hungary drummer Ryan Strathie. Both \\"Keep on Running\\" and \\"Baby I am Nobody Now\\" featured in the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2013 at number 57 and number 81, respectively. \\"Keep on Running\\" was also featured in the 2CD compilation CD from the countdown. In May 2014, Bull confirmed details of his second studio album. The album, entitled Sea of Approval, was released on 11 July 2014. The album features both \\"Keep on Running\\" – which features the lyrics that make up the album title – and \\"Baby I Am Nobody Now.\\" A third single, \\"Talk Too Much,\\" was also confirmed. The track was posted to SoundCloud later that day. A music video for the song was released on 3 July 2014. It featured TV presenter John Mangos and Australian singer-songwriter Megan Washington. The song was voted in at number 61 in the Hottest 100. In June 2020, it was announced 'Sea Of Approval' would receive a vinyl pressing for the first time ever via Waxx Lyrical Record Club. ==DiscographyAlbums=== * We're Too Young (2009) * Sea of Approval (2014) ===EPs=== * Andy Bull (2008) * Phantom Pains (2010) ===Singles=== * \\"Small Town Girl\\" (2008) * \\"Young Man\\" (2009) * \\"Dog\\" (with Lisa Mitchell) (2010) * \\"Last Waltz\\" (with Hungry Kids of Hungary) (2010) * \\"Keep on Running\\" (2013) * \\"Baby I Am Nobody Now\\" (2013) * \\"Talk Too Much\\" (2014) *\\"Nothing Is Wrong\\" (2014) ==Backing band members== ;Current members * Alex Bennison – guitar, vocals (2010–present) * Ryan Strathie – drums (2013, 2015–present) * Luke Hodgson – bass, vocals (2015–present) ;Former members * Carlos Adura – drums (2009–2010, 2013–2014) * Nick Weaver – bass (2010) * Dave Jenkins Jr. – drums, percussion (2011–2013), bass (2013, 2014) * Ned Cooke – keyboards, synthesizers, sequencer, vocals (2013–2015) ==References*Interview with Australian Music Online *Vibewire Gig Review *3D World Article *Andy Bull - IMDb Category:Australian rock singers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Island Records artists ","title":"Andy Bull"},{"id":"19283127","text":"Fraley may refer to: * Fraley (surname) * Fraley Island, Nunavut * Fraley v.

Lithuania is a member of the European Union and its GDP per capita is the highest in the Baltic states. Lithuania belongs to the group of very high human development countries and is a member of WTO and OECD. Lithuania was the first country to declare independence from Soviet Union in 1990 and rapidly moved from centrally planned to a market economy, implementing numerous liberal reforms. It enjoyed high growth rates after joining the European Union along with the other Baltic states, leading to the notion of a Baltic Tiger. Lithuania's economy (GDP) grew more than 500 percent since regaining independence in 1990. Half of the workforce in the Baltic states – 3.3 million live in Lithuania – 1.4 million. GDP growth reached its peak in 2008, and is approaching the same levels again in 2018. Similar to the other Baltic States, the Lithuanian economy suffered a deep recession in 2009, with GDP falling by almost 15%. After severe recession, the country's economy started to show signs of recovery already in 3rd quarter of 2009, returned to growth in 2010 with positive 1.3 outcome and with 6.6 per cent growth during the first half of 2011 country is one of the fastest growing economies in the EU. GDP growth has resumed in 2010, albeit at a slower pace than before the crisis. Success of the crisis taming is attributed to the austerity policy of the Lithuanian Government. Lithuania has a sound fiscal position. The 2017 budget resulted in a 0.5% surplus, the gross debt is stabilising at around 40% of GDP. The budget remained positive in 2017 and is expected so in 2018. Lithuania is ranked 11th in the world in the Ease of Doing Business Index prepared by the World Bank Group and 16th out of 178 countries in the Index of Economic Freedom, measured by The Heritage Foundation. On average, more than 95% of all foreign direct investment in Lithuania comes from European Union countries. Sweden is historically the largest investor with 20% – 30% of all FDI in Lithuania. FDI into Lithuania spiked in 2017, reaching its highest ever recorded number of greenfield investment projects. In 2017, Lithuania was third country, after Ireland and Singapore by the average job value of investment projects. Based on OECD data, Lithuania is among the top 5 countries in the world by postsecondary (tertiary) education attainment. Educated workforce attracted investments especially in ICT sector during the past years. The Lithuanian government and the Bank of Lithuania simplified procedures for obtaining licences for the activities of e-money and payment institutions. positioning the country as one of the most attractive for the FinTech initiatives in EU. ==History of economy== The history of Lithuania can be divided into seven major periods. All the periods have some interesting and important facts that affected the economic situation of the country in those times. *Ancient times – Baltic tribes (until the 13th century) *Kingdom of Lithuania (1251–1263) *Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1263–1569) *Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795) *Pressure of the Russian Empire (1795–1914) *Republic of Lithuania during the interwar period (1918–1940) *Soviet occupied Lithuania (1944–1990) *Republic of Lithuania (1990–) ===History up to the 20th century=== The first Lithuanians formed a branch of an ancient ethno-linguistic group known as the Balts. Lithuanian tribes maintained close trade contacts with the Roman Empire.IBP, Inc. Lithuania Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments. Ed. Lulu.com 2015.

Consolidation of the Lithuanian lands began in the late 12th century. King Mindaugas was the first pan-Lithuanian ruler, as the Catholic King of Lithuania in 1253. The expansion of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania reached its height in the middle of the 14th century under the Grand Duke Gediminas (reigned 1316–1341), who established a strong central government which later came to dominate the territories from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. Grand Duke Gediminas issued letters to the Hanseatic league, offering free access to his domains for men of every order and profession from nobles and knights to tillers of the soil. Economic immigrants and immigrants, seeking religious freedom improved the level of handicrafts. During the reign of Duke Kęstutis (1297–1382), the first cash taxes were introduced, although most taxes were still paid in goods (e.g., wheat, cattle, horses). In 1569 the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth formed through the union of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The economy of the Commonwealth was dominated by feudal agriculture based on the exploitation of the agricultural workforce (serfs). Poland-Lithuania played a significant role in supplying 16th-century Western Europe with exports of three sorts of goods: grain (rye), cattle (oxen) and fur. These three articles amounted to nearly 90% of the country's exports to western markets by overland and maritime trade. There was even a Lithuanian trading vessel – vytinė, used for four hundred years to transport grain via Nemunas river. Statutes of Lithuania were the main collections of law statements and rules in Lithuania. The Commonwealth was famous for Europe's first and the world's second modern codified national constitution, the so-called Constitution of 3 May, declared on 3 May 1791 (after the 1788 ratification of the United States Constitution). Economic and commercial reforms, previously shunned as unimportant by the Szlachta, were introduced, and the development of industries was encouraged. Following the partitions of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772, 1793 and 1795, the Russian Empire controlled the majority of Lithuania. During the administration of the Lithuanian lands by the Russian Empire from 1772 to 1917, one of the most important events that affected economic relations was the emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia. The reform amounted to the liquidation of serf dependence previously suffered by peasants; it boosted the development of capitalism. ===Lithuania in the 20th century=== The Bank of Lithuania building in Kaunas, 1933–1939 On 16 February 1918, the Council of Lithuania passed a resolution for the re-establishment of the Independent State of Lithuania. Soon, many economic reforms for sustainable economic growth were implemented. A national currency, called the Lithuanian litas, was introduced in 1922. It proved to become one of the strongest and most stable currencies in Europe during the inter-war period. Lithuania had a monometalism system where one litas was covered by 0.150462 grams of gold stored by the Bank of Lithuania in foreign countries. Litas remained stable even in the period of Great Depression. During the time of its independence, 1918–1940, Lithuania made substantial progress. For example, Lithuania was the third-ranking flax producer and exporter in the world market (export of flax constituted about 30 percent of all export share), being surpassed only by Soviet Russia and Poland; Lithuanian farm products such as meat, dairy products, many kinds of grain, potatoes, etc. were of superior quality in the world market. Lithuanian farmers were joining into cooperative companies – e.g. Lietūkis, Pienocentras, Linas, which helped farmers to process and sell their products more efficiently and profitably. Having taken advantage of favorable international developments, and driven by its foreign policy aims directed against Lithuanian statehood, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) occupied Lithuania in 1940. Land and the most important objects for the economy were nationalized, and most of the farms collectivized. Just after one year of occupation, poverty level, unemployment increased dramatically, lack of food products appeared. Later, many inefficient factories and industry companies, highly dependent on other regions of USSR, were established in Lithuania. Despite that, in 1990, GDP per capita of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic was $8,591, which was above the average for the rest of the Soviet Union of $6,871 but lagging behind developed western countries. The Soviet era brought Lithuania intensive industrialization and economic integration into the USSR, although the level of technology and state concern for environmental, health, and labor issues lagged far behind Western standards. Urbanization increased from 39% in 1959 to 68% in 1989. From 1949 to 1952 the Soviets abolished private ownership in agriculture, establishing collective and state farms. Production declined and did not reach pre-war levels until the early 1960s. The intensification of agricultural production through intense chemical use and mechanization eventually doubled production but created additional ecological problems. This changed after independence, when farm production dropped due to difficulties in restructuring the agricultural sector. The overall damage, resulted from the Soviet occupation (including the loss of gross domestic product), estimated according to the UN recognised methodologies amounted to approximately US$800 billion; direct damage (including genocide and deportations of the citizens, property looting) estimation is US$20 billion. According to a 2019 study by economic historians, Lithuania had above average economic growth from 1937 to 1973 (when compared to other economies), but below average growth from 1973 to 1990. ===Development since the 1990s=== Countries with larger GDP PPP per capita than Lithuania in 1995 vs 2017 Reforms since the mid-1990s led to an open and rapidly growing economy. Open to global trade and investment, Lithuania now enjoys high degrees of business, fiscal, and financial freedom. Lithuania is a member of the EU and the WTO, so regulation is relatively transparent and efficient, with foreign and domestic capital subject to the same rules. The financial sector is advanced, regionally integrated, and subject to few intrusive regulations. One of Lithuania's most important reforms was the privatization of state-owned assets. The first stage of privatization was being implemented between 1991 and 1995. Citizens were given investment vouchers worth €3.1 billion in nominal value, which let them participate in assets selling. By October 1995, they were used as follows: 65% for acquisition of shares; 19% for residential dwellings; 5% for agricultural properties; and 7% remained unused. More than 5,700 enterprises with €2.0 billion worth of state capital in book value were sold using four initial privatization methods: share offerings; auctions; best business plans competitions; and hard currency sales. The second privatization step began in 1995 by approving a new law that ensured greater diversity of privatization methods and that enabled participation in the selling process without vouchers. Between 1996 and 1998, 526 entities were sold for more than €0.7 billion. Before the reforms, the public sector totally dominated the economy, whereas the share of the private sector in GDP increased to over 70% by the 2000 and 80% in 2011. Monetary reform was undertaken in early nineties to improve the stability of the economy. Lithuania chose a currency board system controlled by the Bank of Lithuania independent of any government institution. On 25 June 1993, the Lithuanian litas was introduced as a freely convertible currency, but on 1 April 1994 it was pegged to the United States dollar at a rate of 4 to 1. The mechanism of the currency board system enabled Lithuania to stabilize inflation rates to single digits. The stable currency rate helped to establish foreign economic relations, therefore leading to a constant growth of foreign trade. By 1998, the economy had survived the early years of uncertainty and several setbacks, including a banking crisis. However, the collapse of the Russian ruble in August 1998 shocked the economy into negative growth and forced the reorientation of trade from Russia towards the West. Share of private sector in GDP Lithuania was invited to the Helsinki EU summit in December 1999 to begin EU accession talks in early 2000. After the Russian financial crisis, the focus of Lithuania's export markets shifted from East to West. In 1997, exports to the Soviet Union's successor entity (the Commonwealth of Independent States) made up 45% of total Lithuanian exports. This share of exports dropped to 21% of the total in 2006, while exports to EU members increased to 63% of the total. Exports to the United States made up 4.3% of all Lithuania's exports in 2006, and imports from the United States comprised 2% of total imports. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2005 was €0.8 billion. On 2 February 2002 the litas was pegged to the euro at a rate of 3.4528 to 1, which remained until Lithuania adopted the euro in 2015. Lithuania was very close to introducing the euro in 2007, but the inflation level exceeded the Maastricht requirements. On 1 January 2015, Lithuania became the 19th country to use the euro. The Vilnius Stock Exchange, now renamed the NASDAQ OMX Vilnius, started its activity in 1993 and was the first stock exchange in the Baltic states. In 2003, the VSE was acquired by OMX. Since 27 February 2008 the Vilnius Stock Exchange has been a member of NASDAQ OMX Group, which is the world's largest exchange company across six continents, with over 3,800 listed companies. The market cap of Vilnius Stock Exchange was €3.4 billion on 27 November 2009. During the last decade (1998–2008) the structure of Lithuania's economy has changed significantly. The biggest changes were recorded in the agricultural sector as the share of total employment decreased from 19.2% in 1998 to just 7.9% in 2008. The service sector plays an increasingly important role. The share of GDP in financial intermediation and real estate sectors was 17% in 2008 compared to 11% in 1998. The share of total employment in the financial sector in 2008 has doubled compared with 1998.Structure of gross value added by kind of economic activity and year ===Lithuania in the 21st century=== Real GDP growth in Lithuania, 1996–2019 Economic sentiment indicator and its components Balance of payments in Lithuania, quarterly data Between 2000 and 2017, the Lithuanian GDP grew by 308%. One of the most important factors contributing to Lithuania's economic growth was its accession to the WTO in 2001 and the EU in 2004, which allows free movement of labour, capital, and trade among EU member states. On the other hand, rapid growth caused some imbalances in inflation and balance of payments. The current account deficit to GDP ratio in 2006–2008 was in the double digits and reached its peak in the first quarter of 2008 at a threatening 18.8%. This was mostly due to rapid loan portfolio growth as Scandinavian banks provided cheap credit under quite lax rules in Lithuania. The volume of loans to acquire lodgings has grown from 50 million LTL in 2004 up to 720 million LTL in 2007. Consumption was affected by credit expansion as well. This led to high inflation of goods and services, as well as trade deficit. A housing bubble was formed. The global credit crunch which started in 2008 affected the real estate and retail sectors. The construction sector shrank by 46.8% during the first three-quarters of 2009 and the slump in retail trade was almost 30%. GDP plunged by 15.7% in the first nine months of 2009. Lithuania was the last among the Baltic states to be hit by recession because its GDP growth rate in 2008 was still positive, followed by a slump of more than 15% in 2009. In the third quarter of 2009, compared to the previous quarter, GDP again grew by 6.1% after five-quarters with negative numbers. Austerity policy (four-fifths of the fiscal adjustment consisted of expenditure cuts) introduced by the Kubilius government helped to balance the current account from −15.5 in 2007 to 1.6 in 2009. Economic sentiment and confidence of all business activities have rebounded from a record low at the beginning of the year 2009. Sectors related to domestic consumption and real estate still suffer from the economic crisis, but exporters have started making profits even with lower levels of revenue. The catalysts of growing profit margins are lower raw material prices and staff expense. At the end of 2017, investment of Lithuania's enterprises abroad amounted to EUR 2.9 billion. The largest investment was made in Netherlands (24.1 per cent of the total direct investment abroad), Cyprus (19.8 per cent), Latvia (14.9 per cent), Poland (10.5 per cent) and Estonia (10.3 per cent). Lithuania's direct investment in the EU member states totalled EUR 2.6 billion, or 89.3 per cent of the total direct investment abroad. Based on the Eurostat's data, in 2017, the value of Lithuanian exports recorded the most rapid growth not only in the Baltic countries, but also across Europe, which was 16.9 per cent. Lithuania performs well in few measures of well-being in the Better Life Index by OECD, ranking above the average in education and skills, and work-life balance. It is below the average in income and wealth, jobs and earnings, housing, health status, social connections, civic engagement, environmental quality, personal security, and subjective well-being. Lithuanian people are the happiest people in the Baltic States. Euro adoption On 1 January 2015, Lithuania became the 19th country to adopt the euro. Joining the euro would relieve the Bank of Lithuania of defending the value of the litas, and \\"it would give Lithuania a say in the decision-making of the European Central Bank (ECB), as well as access to the ECB single-resolution fund and cheaper borrowing costs\\". ==Business climate== Cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2017 was EUR 14.7 billion, or 35 per cent of GDP, EUR 5215 per capita. The largest FDI flow in Lithuania was into manufacturing (EUR 73.7 million), agriculture, forestry, fishery (EUR 27.4 million), information and communication (EUR 10 million). Sweden, The Netherlands and Germany have remained the largest investors. Lithuania seeks to become an innovation hub by 2020. To reach this goal, it is putting its efforts into attracting FDI to added-value sectors, especially IT services, software development, consulting, finance, and logistics. Well-known international companies such as Microsoft, IBM, Transcom, Barclays, Siemens, SEB, TeliaSonera, Paroc, Wix.com, Philip Morris, Thermo Fisher Scientific established a presence in Lithuania. Lithuanian FEZs (Free economic zone) offer developed infrastructure, service support, and tax incentives. A company set up in an FEZ is exempt from corporate taxation for its first six years, as well as a tax on dividends and real estate tax. 7 FEZ operate in Lithuania – Marijampolė Free Economic Zone, Kaunas Free Economic Zone, Klaipėda Free Economic Zone, Panevėžys Free Economic Zone, Akmenė Free Economic Zone, Šiauliai Free Economic Zone, Kėdainiai Free Economic Zone. There are nine industrial sites in Lithuania, which can also provide additional advantages by having a well-developed infrastructure, offering consultancy service and tax incentives. Lithuania is ranked third among developed economies by the quantity (16) of Special Economic Zones – after USA (256) and Poland (21). Lithuanian municipalities provide special incentives to investors who create jobs or invest in infrastructure. Municipalities may tie designation criteria to additional factors, such as the number of jobs created or environmental benefits. Strategic investors' benefits could include favorable tax incentives for up to ten years. Municipalities may grant special incentives to induce investments in municipal infrastructure, manufacturing, and services. About 40 percent of surveyed investors confirmed that they carrying out Research and experimental development (R&D;) or plan to do it in their Lithuanian branches. In 2018 Lithuania ranked as the second most attractive location for manufacturers in the Manufacturing Risk Index 2018. In 2019, Lithuania was 16th in Top 20 European FDI destination countries list, created by the Ernst & Young. ==Corporations== Lithuania traditionally has strong agricultural, furniture, logistics, textile, biotechnology and laser industries. Maxima is a retail chain operating in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and Bulgaria and it is the largest Lithuanian capital company and the largest employer in the Baltic states. Girteka Logistics is a largest Europe's transport company. Biotechpharma is a biopharmaceutical research and development company with a focus on recombinant protein technology development. The BIOK Laboratory is a startup founded by biochemistry scientists which is the biggest producer of Lithuanian natural cosmetic products. UAB SANITEX is the largest wholesale, distribution and logistics company in Lithuania and Latvia, also active in Estonia and Poland. UAB SoliTek Cells – leading producer of solar cells in Northern Europe. One of the leaders of cellular IoT gateways producers in Europe – UAB Teltonika. In the \\"Baltic Top 50\\", the biggest Baltic states companies rating created by Coface, more than half – 29 – companies are from Lithuania. ==Workforce== Labour productivity level of Lithuania is one of the lowest in the EU. OECD, 2017. Population with higher education, 2001–2008 Salaries and unemployment, 2001–2009 The number of the population aged 15 years and over is 1.45 million, activity rate was 60 percent in 2017. During the period of 1995–2017 average salary grew more than four times in Lithuania. Despite this, labour costs in Lithuania are among the lowest in the EU. Average monthly net salary in IV quarter 2018 was EUR 800 and increased by 9.5 percent. Unemployment in Lithuania has been volatile. Since the year 2001, the unemployment rate has decreased from almost 20% to less than 4% in 2007 thanks to two main reasons. Firstly, during the time of rapid economic expansion, numerous work places were established. This caused a decrease in the unemployment rate and a rise in staff expenses. Secondly, emigration has also reduced unemployment problems since accession to the EU. However, the economic crisis of year 2008 has lowered the need for workers, so the unemployment rate increased to 13.8% and then stabilized in the third quarter of 2009. Unemployment rate in I quarter of 2018 was 6.3 percent. Lithuania is among the top 5 countries in the world by postsecondary (tertiary) education attainment., 54.9% of the population aged 25 to 34, and 30.7% of the population aged 55 to 64 had completed tertiary education. The share of tertiary-educated 25–64-year-olds in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields in Lithuania were above the OECD average (29% and 26% respectively), similarly to business, administration and law (25% and 23% respectively). The level of labour productivity in Lithuania today is about one-third below the OECD average. Lithuania is ranked 15th in Employment Flexibility Index. ==Income and wealth distribution== Lithuania belongs to high income group according to Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2019. As of 2019, Lithuanian average wealth per adult was $50,254 (an increase of 82% from $27,507 in the year 2017) Household debt is among the lowest among EU countries – 49 percent of net disposable income in 2015. ==Sectors of economyServices=== One of the most important sub-sectors is information and communication technologies (ICT). Around 37,000 employees work for more than 2,000 ICT companies. ICT received 9.5% of total FDI. Lithuania hosts 13 of the 20 largest IT companies in the Baltic States. Lithuania exported EUR 128 million worth ICT services in II quarter of 2018. Development of shared services and business process outsourcing are some of the most promising fields. Companies that have outsourced their business operations to Lithuania include Barclays, Danske Bank, CITCO Group, Western Union, Uber, MIRROR, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Anthill, Adform, Booking Holdings (Kayak.com, Booking.com), HomeToGo, Visma, Unity, Yara International, Nasdaq Nordic, Bentley Systems, Ernst & Young and many more. Financial services Barclays Technology Centre in Vilnius Lending and saving data The financial sector concentrates mostly on the domestic market. There are nine commercial banks that hold a license from the Bank of Lithuania and eight foreign bank branches. Most of the banks belong to international corporations, mainly Scandinavian. The financial sector has demonstrated incredible growth in the pre-crisis period (1998–2008). Bank assets were only €3.2 billion or 25.5% from GDP in 2000, half of which consisted of loan portfolio. By the beginning of the year 2009, bank assets grew to €26.0 billion or 80.8% to GDP, the loan portfolio reached €20.7 billion. The loan-to-GDP ratio was 64%. The growth of deposits was not as fast as that of loans. At the end of 2008, the loan portfolio was almost twice as big as that of deposits. It demonstrated high dependence on external financing. Contraction in the loan portfolio has been recorded over the past year, so the loans to deposits ratio are slowly getting back to healthy levels. =FinTech= The country has increasingly sought position itself as the EU's main fintech hub, hoping to attract international firms by promising to provide European operational licences within three months, compared to a waiting period of up to a year in countries like Germany or the UK. In 2017 only, 35 FinTech companies came to Lithuania – a result of Lithuanian government and Bank of Lithuania simplified procedures for obtaining licences for the activities of e-money and payment institutions. Europe's first international Blockchain Centre launched in Vilnius in 2018. The government of Lithuania also aims to attract financial institutions looking for a new location after Brexit. Lithuania has granted a total of 39 e-money licenses, second in the EU only to the U.K. with 128 licenses. In 2018, Google set up a payment company in Lithuania, Vilnius was ranked a seventh FinTech city by foreign direct investment (FDI) performance in 2019. Central Bank of Lithuania established a Regulatory sandbox to test financial innovations in a live environment under the guidance and supervision of the Bank of Lithuania. Bank of Lithuania has also developed LBChain which is the world's first blockchain-based sandbox developed by a financial market regulator, combining technological and regulatory infrastructures. Moody's Corporation declared about opening its office in Vilnius. ===Manufacturing=== Lithuania has a much larger manufacturing sector share in the economy’s structure than the other Baltic countries. In this regards Lithuania is closer to some Central European countries like Czech Republic or Germany. Manufacturing constitutes the biggest part of gross value added in Lithuania. The food processing sector constitutes 11% of total exports. Dairy products, especially cheese, are well known in neighbouring countries. Another important manufacturing activity is chemical products. The manufacturing of machinery and equipment sector in Lithuania comprises 7.1% of the country’s GDP. 80% of production is exported so chemical products constitute 12.5% of total exports. Year 2019 was exemplary – more than 10 new factories were opened in Lithuania, working in the fields in engineering, high precision instruments, furniture and medical products. ;Furniture Furniture production employs more than 50,000 people and has seen double-digit growth over the last three years. The biggest companies in this field work in cooperation with IKEA, which owns one of the biggest wood processing companies in Lithuania. Lithuania is the fourth biggest supplier of furniture for IKEA after Poland, Italy and Germany. ;Automotive industry Continental AG in 2018 started to build a factory for high precision car electronics – biggest greenfield investment project in Lithuania so far. Another German manufacturer of lighting technology Hella opened a plant in 2018 in Kaunas FEZ, which will produce sensors, actuators and control modules for automotive industry. Lithuania's automotive cluster experienced significant growth during the past 5 years. Companies in the automotive and engineering sector are relatively small but offer flexible services for small and non-standard orders at competitive prices. The sector employs about 3% of the working population and receives 5.6% of FDI. Vilnius Gediminas Technical University prepares experts for the sector. ;Biotechnology and life sciences Lithuania's life science sector is growing around 20–25% annually; with special focus on the production and research of biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical devices. ;Laser technology Lithuanian laser companies were among the first ones in the world to transfer fundamental research into manufacturing. Lithuania's laser producers export laser technologies and devices to nearly 100 countries. Half of all picosecond lasers sold worldwide are produced by Lithuanian companies, while Lithuanian- made femtosecond parametric light amplifiers, used in generating the ultrashort laser pulses, account for as much as 80% of the world market. ===Tourism=== Tourism in Lithuania becoming increasingly important for local economy, constituting around 5.3% of GDP in 2016. Lithuania has 22,000 rivers and rivulets, 3,000 lakes, a well-developed rural tourism network, a unique coastal area of almost 100 km and four UNESCO World Heritage sites. Lithuania receives more than 1.4 million foreign tourists a year. Germany, Poland, Russia, Latvia, and Belarus supply the most tourists, and a significant number arrive from the UK, Finland, and Italy as well. ===Agriculture=== Despite a decreased share in GDP, the agricultural sector is still important for Lithuania as it employs almost 8% of the work force and supplies materials for the food processing sector. 44.8% of the land is arable. Total crop area was 1.8 million hectares in 2008. Cereals, wheat, and triticale are the most popular production of farms. The number of livestock and poultry has decreased twofold compared to the 1990s. The number of cattle in Lithuania at the beginning of the year 2009 was 770,000, the number of dairy cows was 395,000, and the number of poultry was 9.1 million. Lithuanian food consumption has evolved; between 1992 and 2008, consumption of vegetables increased by 30% to 86 kg per capita, and consumption of meat and its products increased by 23% during the same period to 81 kg per capita. On the other hand, consumption of milk and dairy products has decreased to 268 kg per capita by 21%, and the consumption of bread and grain products decreased to 114 kg per capita by 19% as well. ==Regional situation== Regional GDP per capita GDP per capita versus national average, % { class=\\"sortable \\" style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\\" - ! style=\\"width:140px;\\"County !! style=\\"width:70px;\\"Area (km²)!! style=\\"width:50px;\\"Population (thousands) in 2018!! style=\\"width:50px;\\"Nominal GDP billions EUR in 2018 !! style=\\"width:50px;\\"Nominal GDP per capita EUR in 2018 !! style=\\"width:70px;\\"GDP PPP per capita USD in 2018!! style=\\"width:50px;\\"Countries with comparable GDP PPP per capita -  Alytus County  5,425  137  1.3  9,800  21,100  Mexico -  Kaunas County  8,089  562  9.4  15,200  32,700  Bahamas -  Klaipėda County  5,209  318  4.9  15,600  33,500  Bahamas -  Marijampolė County  4,463  140  1.3  9,400  20,200  Belarus -  Panevėžys County  7,881  222  2.6  11,800  25,400  Panama -  Šiauliai County  8,540  264  3.2  12,200  26,200  Croatia -  Tauragė County  4,411  95  0.9  9,100  19,600  Iran -  Telšiai County  4,350  136  1.5  11,600  24,900  Panama -  Utena County  7,201  128  1.2  9,300  20,000  Belarus -  Vilnius County  9,729  808  18.9  23,400  50,300  Bahrain - ! Lithuania ! 65,300 ! 2,800 ! 45.3 ! 16,200 ! 34,800 ! Slovakia } Lithuania is divided into ten counties. There are four cities with a population over 100,000 and four cities of over 30,000 people. The gross regional product is concentrated in the three largest counties – Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipėda. These three counties account for 70% of the GDP with just 60% of the population. Service centers and industry are concentrated there. In five counties (those of Alytus, Marijampolė, Panevėžys, Šiauliai and Tauragė), GDP per capita is still below 80% of the national average. In order to achieve balanced regional distribution of GDP, nine public industrial parks (Akmene Industrial Park, Alytus Industrial Park, Kedainiai Industrial Park, Marijampolė Industrial Park, Pagegiai Industrial Park, Panevėžys Industrial Park, Radviliskis Industrial Park, Ramygala Industrial Park and Šiauliai Industrial Park) and three private industrial parks (Tauragė Private Industrial Park, Sitkunai Private Industrial Park, Ramučiai Private Logistic and Industrial Park) were established to provide some tax incentives and prepared physical infrastructure. ==Infrastructure== The transport, storage, and communication sector has increased its importance to the economy of Lithuania. In 2008, it accounted for 12.1% of GDP compared to 9.1% in 1996. ===Communications=== Lithuania has a broadly developed radio, television, landline and mobile phone, as well as broadband internet networks. Lithuanian National Radio and Television, the public broadcaster in Lithuania operates 3 television channels, including a satellite channel, as well as 3 radio stations. Privately owned commercial TV and Radio broadcasters operate a multitude national, regional and local channels.\\"Communications\\" , Lithuania, World Factbook, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, 13 May 2015. Retrieved 20 May 2015. There are four TIER III datacenters in Lithuania. Lithuania is 44th globally ranked country on data center density according to Cloudscene. The fixed landline network connects 625 thousand households and businesses (down from the record 845 thousand in 2005). The decline in subscription and utilization of the landline network has been driven by increased availability of mobile phone services. The mobile telephony penetration rate in Lithuania (of 151 per 100 population in 2013) has been one of the highest in the world. In 2013, there were 13 providers of mobile phone services, with the three largest ones – BITĖ Lietuva, Omnitel, and Tele2 – operating their own cellular networks. Lithuanian retail internet sector is competitive, with more than 100 service providers. Retail internet connectivity in Lithuania was among the cheapest in Europe; however, the internet penetration rate (64% of households using internet in 2013) was lower than in other EU countries in the region – Estonia (79%), Latvia (70%) and Poland (69%). Lithuanian internet connection speeds have been claimed to be among the fastest in the world based on user- initiated tests at Speedtest.net. ===Energy=== Heating energy data The utilities sector accounts for more than 3% of gross value added in Lithuania. Electricity production exceeded 12 billion kWh in 2007, and consumption exceeded 9.6 billion kWh. Surplus electricity is exported. Lithuania operated a nuclear power plant in Visaginas, which produced 72% of electricity in Lithuania. The plant was shut down on 31 December 2009 in line with the commitments made when Lithuania joined EU in 2004. New nuclear power plant in Visaginas has been proposed but the status of the project is uncertain after it was rejected by the voters in a referendum in 2012. The supply of heating energy has been modernized during the last decade (1998–2008). Technological loss in the heat energy system has decreased significantly from 26.2% in the year 2000 to 16.7% in 2008. The amount of air pollution was reduced by one- third. The share of renewable energy resources in the total fuel balance for heat production increased to almost 20%. In order to break down Gazprom's monopoly in natural gas market of Lithuania, first large scale LNG import terminal (Klaipėda LNG FSRU) in the Baltic region was built in port of Klaipėda in 2014. The Klaipėda LNG terminal was called Independence, thus emphasising the aim to diversify energy market of Lithuania. Norvegian company Equinor supplies of natural gas annually from 2015 until 2020. The terminal is able to meet the Lithuania's demand 100 percent, and Latvia's and Estonia's national demand 90 percent in the future. Kruonis Pumped Storage Plant operates as pumped-storage providing a spinning reserve of the power system, in order to regulate the load curve of the power system 24 hours a day. In 2015 Kruonis Industrial Park was established as a place for data centers. In 2018 synchronising the Baltic States' electricity grid with the Synchronous grid of Continental Europe has started. ===Transport=== Volume of goods transported, million tonne-kilometers Funding of roads Lithuania forms part of the transport corridor between the East and the West. The volume of goods transported by road transport has increased fivefold since 1996. The total length of roadways is more than 80,000 km, and 90% of them are paved. The government spending on road infrastructure exceeded €0.5 billion in 2008. Via Baltica highway passes through Kaunas, while membership in the Schengen Agreement allows for smooth border crossing to Poland and Latvia. Railway transport in Lithuania provides long-distance passenger and cargo services. Railways carry approximately 50 million tons of cargo and 7 million passengers a year. Direct rail routes link Lithuania with Russia, Belarus, Latvia, Poland, and Germany. Also, the main transit route between Russia and Russia's Kaliningrad Region passes through Lithuania. Lithuanian Railways AB transports about 44% of the freight carried through Lithuania. This is a very high indicator compared to other EU countries, where freight transportation by rail amounts to only 10% of the total. An ice-free seaport of Klaipeda is located in the western part of Lithuania. The port is an important regional transport hub connecting the sea, land and railway routes from east and west. It handles roughly 7,000 ships and 30 million tons of cargo every year, and accepts large-tonnage vessels (dry-cargo vessels up to 70,000 DWT, tankers up to 100,000 DWT and cruise ships up to 270 meters long). The seaport of Klaipėda is able to receive Panamax-type vessels. One of the fastest growing segments of sea transport is passenger traffic, which has increased fourfold since 2002. The inland river cargo port in Marvelė, linking Kaunas and Klaipėda, received first cargo in 2019. Lithuania has four international airports – Vilnius Airport (VNO), Kaunas Airport (KUN), Šiauliai Airport (SQQ) and Palanga Airport (PLQ). More than 30 domestic airports being used by aeroclubs and amateur pilots. ===Storage=== There are more than 600,000 m2 of modern logistics and warehousing facilities in Lithuania. The biggest supply of new, modern warehousing facilities is in the capital city Vilnius (after the completion of several new projects in the third quarter of 2009, the supply of modern warehousing premises has increased by nearly 12% in Vilnius and currently reaches 334,400 m2 of the rentable area). Kaunas is in the second place (around 200,000 m2), and Klaipėda in the third (122,500 m2). Since the beginning of the year 2009, prices for warehousing premises have dropped by 20–25% in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipėda, and the current level of rents has reached the level of 2003. The costs for renting new warehouses in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Klaipėda are similar and reach 0.75 to 1.42 EUR/m2, while the rents of old warehouses are 0.35 to 0.67 EUR/m2. ==International trade== Foreign trade, 1995–2008 Lithuanian economy is highly open and International trade is crucial. As a result, the ratio of foreign trade to GDP for Lithuania has often exceeded 100%. The EU is the biggest trade partner of Lithuania with a 67% of total imports and 61.3% of total exports during 2015. The Commonwealth of Independent States is the second economic union that Lithuania trades the most with, with a share of imports of 25% and a share of exports of 23.9% during the same period. The vast majority of commodities, including oil, gas, and metals have to be imported, mainly from Russia, however in the recent years Lithuania's energy dependence has shifted towards other countries such as Norway and the US. Mineral products constitute 25% of imports and 18% of exports, mainly driven by the presence of ORLEN Lietuva oil refinery with a refining capacity of 9 million tons a year, owned by Polish concern PKN Orlen. Orlen Lietuva sold over €3.5 billion worth of products outside Lithuania, compared to the total Lithuanian exports of €24 billion in 2014. Some sectors are directed mainly at export markets. Transport and logistics export ⅔ of their products and/or services; the biotechnology industry exports 80%; plastics export 52%; laser technologies export 86%; metal processing, machinery and electric equipment export 64%; furniture and wood processing export 55%; textile and clothing export 76%; and the food industry exports 36%. {  + Foreign trade partners, January–December 2017 (structure of the statistics is highly affected by oil refinery ORLEN Lietuva importing and exporting big amounts of oil products) !Country !Import !Country !Share of goods of Lithuanian origin in export !Export -  EU  70.6%  EU 69.6%  58.3% -  Russia  12.6%  Russia 7.8%  14.8% -  Germany  12.3%  Latvia 44.6%  9.9% -  Poland  10.7%  Poland 65.7%  8.1% -  Latvia  7.2%  Germany 77.8%  7.3% -  Italy  5.2%  United States 89.1%  5.2% -  Netherlands  5.1%  Estonia 48.4%  5.0% -  Sweden  3.9%  Sweden 89.8%  4.8% -  France  3.8%  Belarus 13.8%  3.8% -  United Kingdom  3.3%  United Kingdom 85.7%  3.5% -  Belgium  3.3%  Netherlands 82.5%  3.5% -  Estonia  3.2%  Norway 89.5%  2.8% } ==Natural resources== The total value of natural resources in Lithuania is €17 billion, or around third of Lithuania's GDP.

She was one of the most famous singers of comic opera in the late nineteenth century, as well as an important director of theatre companies and later a celebrated gossip columnist. ==Life and career== Soldene was born in Clerkenwell, London. Her mother was Priscilla Swain Fuller (1812–1900), and although she was apparently the product of a bigamous marriage, she was raised as the daughter of Edward Fuller Solden (1805–1873).Gänzl, Kurt. \\"Soldene, Emily (1838?–1912)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 12 September 2008. In 1859 she married law clerk John Powell (1834?–1881) and gave birth to her first child before she began to study singing in 1861 with William Howard Glover. ===Early career and peak years=== Soldene made her first public appearance in a concert given by Glover in 1862. She began to appear in classical music concerts at St James's Hall in London soon afterwards, but in 1865 she auditioned for Charles Morton at the Canterbury Music Hall. He became a friend and mentor to her, and she then turned from classical music to music hall, appearing steadily at the Oxford Music Hall and elsewhere under the name of Miss Fitz-Henry.Fountain, pp. 48–49 Emily Soldene As English-language versions of French opéra bouffe first arrived in Britain, Soldene soon became the leading proponent of Jacques Offenbach and Hervé, combining her comedic and vocal talents. According to The Times, \\"Soldene was a fine and a highly-trained Singer. Exeter Hall loved her in oratorio no less than the Canterbury, the Oxford or the Alhambra [loved her] in more worldly work; but it was in opéra-bouffe that her voice, her vivacity, and her magnetism first found their perfect material.\\"Obituary, The Times, 10 April 1912, p. 9 She created the title role in The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein in 1867 for the touring company of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.Photo of Soldene in The Grand Duchess , noting that she created the character in 1867Review of Soldene in an 1870 production of The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein, The Musical World, 19 February 1870, p. 133 In 1870, at the Lyceum Theatre, she played Marguerite in Little Faust (Le petit Faust) and took over title role in Chilpéric.Traubner, Richard. Operetta: A Theatrical History, p. 24, Routledge, 2003 The next year, she toured as Chilpéric in the provinces.Adams, p. 282 For Charles Morton, in 1871 at the Islington Philharmonic, she first appeared as Drogan in the long-running production of Geneviève de Brabant (also directing the production), which became her favourite role.Adams, p. 570 Now widely popular, she starred at the Gaiety Theatre, London in 1872 in another production of Geneviève de Brabant and as Mlle. Lange in La fille de Madame Angot in 1873. Soldene was also, for several years, a principal boy in British Christmas pantomimes.Soldene, p. 90 Her popularity allowed her to become the manager of her own company, leading an extensive and highly successful tour of America in 1874–1875. There the company played the same operettas that she had made famous in Britain, as well as Madame l'archiduc. Soldene wrote, \\"From the first moment of going into management – recognizing the attractive force of female beauty – I surrounded myself with the best-looking and best set-up girls that could possibly be found. I selected my chorus from the ballet. The result, a minimum of voice, perhaps, but certainly a maximum of good looks and grace.... They felt the music, were full of life, and, like a blooded horse, were anxious for a start.\\"Busch, Stephen E. \\"Opera Bouffe and its Stars in 19th Century America\\", Opera History of Old Colorado, p. 10 Back in England, in January 1876, Trial by Jury was transferred, by arrangement with manager Charles Morton, to the Opera Comique, where Soldene's sister, Clara Vesey, sang the role of the plaintiff, together with Fred Sullivan and W. S. Penley, while Soldene and Kate Santley appeared in Madame l'ArchiducFitz-Gerald, S. J. Adair. The story of the Savoy opera in Gilbert and Sullivan Days, p. 16, D. Appleton and Co., New York, 1925 and, from March 1876, Soldene, Vesey and Penley appeared in a revival of Geneviève de Brabant.Theatre programme for Trial and Geneviève de Brabant, 18 March 1876, accessed 20 January 2010 Soldene continued to tour her operetta repertory throughout Britain. Soldene as Carmen, 1880 In 1877–1878, she travelled to Australasia and again to America. She starred in her usual repertory with the English Comic Opera Company, adding La belle Hélène, Barbe- bleue, Trial by Jury, The Waterman, Poulet et Poulette, Giroflé-Girofla, La Périchole, and La jolie parfumeuse.National Library of Australia site Back in London in 1879, she played Princess Fanfreluche in La poule aux oeufs d'or and other productions at the Alhambra Theatre.Moss, Simon. Gilbert and Sullivan memorabilia archive Later the same year, Soldene introduced Bizet's opera Carmen for the first time to the British provinces, in English.Information about Soldene's English and Comic Opera Company performances of Carmen in 1879 University of Kent theatre collection ===Later stage career=== Soon afterwards, Soldene's husband died, leaving her a single mother of four. In March 1882, Soldene's opera company (including Alice May) were touring the British provinces, when a train on which they were travelling narrowly escaped a high-speed collision with an express train. Soldene, May and other members of the company were slightly injured falling off their beds as the quick- thinking engineer of a loose engine \\"ran full tilt at\\" the train Soldene's company were riding and quickly pushed it out of the way of the oncoming express train.\\"Local News: Madame Soldene's Company in Danger\\", Liverpool Mercury, 15 March 1882, p. 6 An unsuccessful third tour of America and a costly experiment in theatre management in 1883 depleted Soldene's funds, but she continued with success on tour. Now well into her 40s and 13 stone [182 pounds] in weight, Soldene was soon \\"forced... to abandon the sexy sophistications of opéra bouffe.\\" Her first character role was in Frivoli at the Drury Lane Theatre, in 1886, together with Marie Tempest.Adams, p. 552 She left this show when America's top musical manager, John McCaull, invited her there to star in comic opera, vaudeville, variety musicals, and, briefly on Broadway with his McCaull Comic Opera Company, as Oudarde in an adaptation of a French melodrama, Lorraine (1887). Soldene wrote a play, Jeanne Fortier, the Bread Carrier, that premiered at Niblo's Garden on 10 June 1889. She then settled in San Francisco, where she played heavy ladies in comic opera from 1890 to 1892 at the Tivoli and the Orpheum theatres. In 1892, she played again for a season in Australia, but the trip was a financial disaster for her and completely depleted her funds. ===Journalism career and last years=== Left without employment, she was forced to seek a new career. A journalist who had admired Soldene obtained a job for her as music and drama critic for the Sydney Evening News. For the next seventeen years, she wrote weekly columns of lively London gossip for the Evening News and then The Sun and other publications. Soldene published one novel, Young Mrs. Staples (1896), and a scandalous memoir, the innocently-titled My Theatrical and Musical Recollections (1896). According to theatre historian Kurt Gänzl, this turned out to be the high-society literary sensation of the last years of the nineteenth century. Soldene named a long list of aristocratic and wealthy gentlemen who had had liaisons with young ladies in the theatre during her younger days. Soldene had four children, one of whom became a comedian and dancer, Pip Powell. In 1906, a benefit was held for Soldene at the Palace Theatre. She died of a heart attack at her lodgings in Bloomsbury at the age of 73 and is buried in the graveyard of Shirley Church, London. ==NotesReferences== *Adams, William Davenport.

Derived from the R-series petrol engine, it has a displacement of 1,491 cc and produces . It was underpowered, and due to the use of the insufficiently strong R-series block it was also not very durable. When the new 3R engine required a re-designed block, Toyota chose to cancel the C engine rather than re-engineer it.

For a person or couple to claim one or more persons as their qualifying child, requirements such as relationship, age, and shared residency must be met.

Since the credit phases out at 21% (more than one qualifying child) or 16% (one qualifying child), it is always preferable to have one more dollar of actual salary or wages considering the EITC alone. (Investment income, however, is handled far less gracefully, as one more dollar of income can result in the sudden 100% loss of the entire credit.) If the EITC is combined with multiple other means-tested programs such as Medicaid or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, it is possible that the marginal tax rate approaches or exceeds 100% in rare circumstances depending on the state of residence; conversely, under certain circumstances, net income can rise faster than the increase in wages because the EITC phases in. For tax year 2020, the maximum EITC benefit for a single person or couple filing without qualifying children is $538. The maximum EITC with one qualifying child is $3,584; with two children, it is $5,920; and with three or more qualifying children, it is $6,660.1040 Instructions 2010, rules for EITC pages 45–48, optional worksheets pages 49–51, and the EITC Table itself on pages 52–68. The only required attachment is Schedule EITC if you are claiming one or more qualifying children. These amounts are indexed annually for inflation. The earned income tax credit has been part of political debates in the United States over whether raising the minimum wage or increasing EITC is a better idea. In a random survey of 568 members of the American Economic Association in 2011, roughly 60% of economists agreed (31.7%) or agreed with provisos (30.8%) that the earned income tax credit program should be expanded. ==Overview== In 1969, Richard Nixon proposed the Family Assistance Plan, which included a guaranteed minimum income in the form of a negative income tax. The House of Representatives passed this plan, but the Senate did not. During his 1972 Presidential campaign, George McGovern proposed a demogrant of $1,000 for every American. Critics during this time complained about implying people don't have to work for a living, and saw the program as having too little stigma; during this time, Hawaii had an established residency requirement for public aid, which one Hawaii State Senator suggested was necessary to discourage \\"parasites in paradise\\". Proposed by Russell Long and enacted in 1975, the EITC provides benefits to working recipients with earned income, but not to non-working recipients. The initially modest EITC has been expanded by tax legislation on a number of occasions, including the widely publicized Tax Reform Act of 1986, and was further expanded in 1990, 1993, 2001, and 2009, regardless of whether the act in general raised taxes (1990, 1993), lowered taxes (2001), or eliminated other deductions and credits (1986).Earned Income Tax Credit Parameters 1975–2010, at the Tax Policy Center, Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, 27 Oct. 2009. See footnote for the increases in the travel distance, but not the credit amount, for Married Filling Jointly for the years 2002 through 2010. For example, in 2010, the plateaus for MFJ extend $5,000 further than do the corresponding plateaus for Single, Head of Household, Qualifying Widow(er). For all filing statuses, the phase out for EIC with one child is 16% (15.98%), and the phaseout for two children and for three or more children is 21% (21.06%). Single, Head of Household, and Qualifying Widow(er) are all equally valid, equally advantageous filing statuses for the purposes of Earned Income Credit. Married filing Jointly can sometimes be more advantageous depending on the income level. In 1993, President Clinton tripled the EITC. Today, the EITC is one of the largest anti-poverty tools in the United States. Also, the EITC is mainly used to \\"promote and support work.\\" Most income measures, including the poverty rate, do not account for the credit. A qualifying child can be a person's daughter, son, stepchild, or any further descendant (such as grandchild, great grandchild, etc.) or a person's brother, sister, half sister, half brother, stepbrother, stepsister, or any further descendant (such as niece, nephew, great-nephew, great-great-niece, etc.). A qualifying child can also be in the process of being adopted provided he or she has been lawfully placed. Foster children also count provided either the child has been officially placed or is a member of one's extended family. A younger single parent cannot claim EITC if he or she is also claimable as a qualifying child of their parent or another older relative, which can happen in some extended family situations. This restriction does not apply to a married couple who is claiming EITC with a child, even if one or both spouses are under the age of 19. A person claiming EITC must be older than his or her qualifying child unless the “child” is classified as \\"permanently and totally disabled\\" for the tax year (physician states one year or more). A qualifying \\"child\\" can be up to and including age 18. A qualifying \\"child\\" who is a full- time student (one long semester or equivalent) can be up to and including age 23. And a person classified as \\"permanently and totally disabled\\" (one year or more) can be any age and count as one's qualifying \\"child\\" provided the other requirements are met. Parents claim their own child(ren) if eligible unless they are waiving this year's credit to an extended family member who has higher adjusted gross income. There is no support test for EITC. There is a six-month plus one day shared residency test. In the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the EITC was temporarily expanded for two specific groups: married couples and families with three or more children; this expansion was extended through December 2012 by H.R. 4853, the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. Effective for the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 filing seasons, the EITC supported these taxpayers by: *Increasing benefits for larger families by creating a new category or “third tier” of the EITC for families with three or more children. In this tier, the credit phases in at 45 percent of income (up from 40 percent), effectively increasing the maximum credit for these families by almost $600. *Increasing marriage penalty relief by raising the income threshold at which the EITC begins to phase out for married couples to $5,000 above the amount for unmarried filers, thereby giving MFJ filers a longer plateau. The combined plateau and phase-out range for married filing jointly is still not double that for single filers, and thus there still is a marriage penalty, just less than there used to be. As of early 2012, 26 states have enacted state EITCs: Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. Some of these state EICs are refundable, and some are not. In addition, a few small local EITCs have been enacted in San Francisco, New York City, and Montgomery County, Maryland. ==Earned income== Earned income is defined by the United States Internal Revenue Code as income received through personal effort,What is Earned Income IRS Page defining Earned Income. with the following as the main sources: * Wages, salaries, tips, commissions, and other taxable employee pay. * Net earnings from self-employment. * Gross income received as a statutory employee.Statutory Employee IRS Definition * Disability payments through a private employer's disability plan received prior to minimum retirement age (62 in 2011).Disability and Earned Income Tax Credit, page last reviewed 22-Jan-2013. \\"Benefits such as Social Security Disability Insurance, SSI, or military disability pensions are not considered earned income and cannot be used to claim Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).\\" * Nontaxable combat pay received by a member of the U.S. armed services which he or she elects to include for purposes of EIC calculation. This is an all-or- none election. For each tax year, the service member must elect to include either all of the combat pay or none of it. ==Qualifying children== A person or couple claiming EITC with one or more qualifying children need to fill out and attach Schedule EITC to their 1040 or 1040A. This form asks for the child(ren)'s name, social security number, year of birth, whether an older \\"child\\" age 19 to 23 was classified as a student for the year (full-time status for at least one long semester or equivalent time period), whether an older \\"child\\" is classified as disabled during the year (doctor states one year or more), the child's relationship to claimant, and the number of months the child lived with the claimant in the United States. To claim a person as qualifying child, the following requirements of relationship, age, and shared residence must be met.IRS Publication 596, Earned Income Credit (EIC): For use in preparing 2012 Returns.IRS Schedule EIC. A person or couple claiming qualifying child(ren) need to attach this form to their 1040 or 1040A tax return. === Relationship === In the case of a married couple filing jointly, if one spouse is related to the child by any of the below relationships, both spouses are considered related to the child. The claimant must be related to their qualifying child through blood, marriage, or law. The qualifying child can be: *a person's daughter, son, stepchild, or any further descendant (such as grandchild, great grandchild, etc.), *or a person's brother, sister, half sister, half brother, stepbrother, stepsister, or any further descendant (such as niece, nephew, great-nephew, great-great-niece, etc.), *or a foster child officially placed by an agency, court, or Indian tribal government. Authorized placement agencies include tax-exempt organizations licensed by states as well as organizations authorized by Indian tribal governments to place Native American children. *or an adopted child, including a child in the process of being adopted provided he or she has been lawfully placed. A child might classify as the qualifying child of more than one adult family member, at least initially. For example, in an extended family situation, both a parent and an uncle may meet the initial standards of relationship, age, and residency to claim a particular child. In such a case, there is a further rule: If a single parent or both parents, whether married or not, can claim the child (residency and age) but choose to waive the child to a non-parent, such as a grandparent or uncle or aunt, this non-parent can claim the child only if they have a higher adjusted gross income (AGI) than any parent who has lived with the child for at least six months. This still remains the parent's choice. Provided the parent has lived with the child for at least six months and one day, the parent can always choose to claim his or her child for purposes of the earned income credit. In a tiebreaker situation between two unmarried parents, the tiebreak goes to the parent who lived with the child for the longest. In a tiebreaker between two non-parents, the tiebreak goes to the person with the higher AGI. And in a tiebreaker between a parent and non- parent, the parent wins by definition. These tiebreaker situations only occur if more than one family member actually file tax returns in which they claim the same child. On the other hand, if the family can agree, per the above and following rules, they can engage in a limited amount of tax planning as to which family member claims the child. === Age === A single parent younger than age 19 living in an extended family situation is potentially claimable as the qualifying \\"child\\" of an older relative. And a single parent under age 24 who is also a full-time college student (one long semester or equivalent) living in an extended family situation is also potentially claimable. If so, the younger single parent cannot claim EIC. This rule does not apply to a married couple who are claiming EIC with a child, even if one or both spouses are under the age of 19. (This rule also does not apply if the older relative is not required to file a tax return, and subsequently either does not file or only files to receive a full refund of taxes withheld.) Generally, one sibling claiming another as their qualifying child must be older. In the case of a married couple filing a joint return, only one of the spouses must be older. An exception to the must-be-older-rule is the case of a qualifying child who is classified as \\"permanently and totally disabled\\" (physician states one year or more). Such a \\"child\\" can be any age and the age requirement is considered to be automatically met (of course the relationship and shared residency requirements must still be met). The standard rule is that the qualifying \\"child\\" must be under the age of 19 at the end of the tax year. That is, the younger person can be 18 years and 364 days old on December 31 and the age requirement is met. This age limit is extended for a qualifying \\"child\\" who is also a full-time student during some part of five calendar months. This young adult merely needs to be under age 24 at the end of the tax year for the age requirement to be met (relationship and residency requirements must still be met). That is, the young adult who is full-time for at least part of five different months can be 23 years and 364 days on December 31 and meet the age requirement to be someone else's qualifying \\"child.\\" The standard Fall semester of a university, in which classes start in late August and continue through September, October, November, and early December, counts as part of five calendar months. And a similar conclusion applies to the standard Spring semester. However, the five months need not be consecutive and can be obtained with any combination of shorter periods. A full-time student is a student who is enrolled for the number of hours or courses the school considers to be full-time attendance. High school students who work in co-op jobs or who are in a vocational high school program are classified as full-time students. Schools include technical, trade, and mechanical schools. A person who is classified as \\"permanently and totally disabled\\" (physician states one year or more) can be any age and the age requirement is automatically met. More fully, the definition of \\"permanently and totally disabled\\" is that a person has a mental or physical disability, cannot engage in substantial gainful activity, and a physician has determined that the condition has lasted or is expected to last one year or more (or that it can lead to death). === Shared residence === The claimant must live with their qualifying child(ren) within the fifty states and/or District of Columbia of the United States for more than half the tax year (per instructions, six months and one day is listed as 7 months on Schedule EIC). U.S. military personnel stationed outside the United States on extended active duty are considered to live in the U.S. for purposes of the EIC. Extended active duty means the person is called to duty for an indefinite period or for a period of more than 90 days (which is still considered to be extended active even if the period ends up being less than 90 days). Temporary absences, for either the claimant or the child, due to school, hospital stays, business trips, vacations, shorter periods of military service, or jail or detention, are ignored and instead count as time lived at home. \\"Temporary\\" is perhaps unavoidably vague and generally hinges or whether the claimant and/or the child are expected to return, and the IRS does not provide any substantial guidance past this. If the child was born or died in the year and the claimant's home was the child's home, or potential home, for the entire time the child was alive during the year, this counts as living with the claimant, and per instructions, 12 months is entered on Schedule EIC. Unlike the rules for claiming a dependent, there is no rule that a qualifying child not support herself or himself. A child who supports himself or herself can still qualify as a qualifying child for purposes of the EIC. There is an exception for older married \\"children.\\" If an otherwise qualifying child is married, the claimant needs to be able to claim this child as a dependent (and the married couple must have low enough income so that they are not required to file a return and are either not filing or are filing only for the purpose of claiming a refund on withheld taxes).In addition to being able to claim a married child as a dependent (or be waiving dependency to other parent), there is also the joint return test in which one's married child cannot be filing a joint return, unless it is solely to claim a refund. For example, if one's married child files a joint return in part to claim the Making Work Pay Credit, one cannot claim this child for purposes of the EIC. See page 15 [page 17 in PDF] of Pub. 596. Recall that a qualifying child can be up to and including age 18, up to and including age 23 if a full-time student for one long semester or equivalent, or any age if classified as \\"permanently and totally disabled\\" (physician states one year or more). == Other requirements == Investment income cannot be greater than $3,500 for the 2018 tax year. A claimant must be either a United States citizen or resident alien. In the case of married filing jointly where one spouse is and one isn't, the couple can elect to treat the nonresident spouse as resident and have their entire worldwide income subject to U.S. tax, and will then be eligible for EITC. Filers both with and without qualifying children must have lived in the 50 states and/or District of Columbia of the United States for more than half the tax year (six months and one day). Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and other U.S. territories do not count in this regard. However, a person on extended military duty is considered to have met this requirement for the period of the duty served. Filers who are not claiming a qualifying child must be between the ages of 25 and 64 inclusive. For a married couple without a qualifying child, only one spouse must be within this age range. For a single person with a qualifying child, there is no age requirement per se other than the requirement that the single person not himself or herself be claimable as another relative's qualifying child (see Age section above). A married couple with at least one qualifying child is only occasionally classified as claimable by another relative, especially if the married couple has earned income and elects to claim EITC. All filers and all children being claimed must have a valid social security number. This includes social security cards printed with \\"Valid for work only with INS authorization\\" or \\"Valid for work only with DHS authorization.\\" Single, Head of Household, Qualifying Widow(er), and Married Filing Jointly are all equally valid filing statuses for EITC. In fact, depending on the income of both spouses, Married Filing Jointly can be advantageous in some circumstances because, in 2009, the phase-out for MFJ for begins at $21,450 whereas phase-out begins at $16,450 for the other filing statuses. A couple who is legally married can file MFJ even if they lived apart the entire year and even if they shared no revenues or expenses for the year, as long as both spouses agree. However, if both spouses do not agree, or if there are other circumstances such as domestic violence, a spouse who lived apart with children for the last six months of the year and who meets other requirements can file as Head of Household.A person who is legally married can file as Head of Household if the following conditions are met: The person lived apart from his or her spouse for the last six months of the year, the person individually or jointly paid over half the costs of keeping up a home (or several homes) for the year, the home(s) were the main home of a child for more than half the year, and the person can claim the child as a dependent (or could claim, but are waiving the child to the other parent). See pages 15–16 of 1040 Instructions 2009. And again, Head of Household status is not a requirement for EIC, it’s not even particularly advantegeous. It is just one more option to consider in some circumstances.Mark Moreau, Low-Income Taxpayer Clinic, Southeast Louisiana Legal Services, New Orleans, March 23, 2005, presentation to President’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, Index of /taxreformpanel/meetings, see Moreau.ppt and esp. pages 4 and 7. On page 7, Moreau bluntly states that domestic violence is the leading cause of female poverty. Or, for a couple that is split up but still legally married, they might consider visiting an accountant at separate times and perhaps even signing a joint return on separate visits. There is even an IRS form that can be used to request direct deposit into up to three separate accounts.Form 8888 Allocation of Refund (Including Savings Bond Purchases) is used to request splitting a refund into up to three separate accounts. However, this form cannot be used simultaneously with Form 8379 Injured Spouse Allocation. And also, if the IRS reduces the amount of the refund, there are complicated rules regarding which of the bank accounts the remaining refund will be sent to (see the paragraphs “Past-due federal tax” and “Other offsets” on page 3). Additionally, a refund typically cannot be split with the loan and bank products offered by tax prep companies. In addition, if a person obtains a divorce by December 31, that will carry, since it is marital status on the last day of the year that controls for tax purposes. In addition, if a person is \\"legally separated\\" according to state law by December 31, that will also carry.From Pub. 501 Exemptions, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information “You are separated under an interlocutory (not final) decree of divorce. For purposes of filing a joint return, you are not considered divorced” (part of section “Considered married” on page 5). From 1040 Instructions 2009, “You were legally separated, according to your state law, under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance” (a rule for filing as Single on page 14). And apparently, the IRS does generally defer to state law and does not provide any more guidance than this. The only disqualifying filing status for purposes of the EIC is married filing separately. EIC phases out by the greater of earned income or adjusted gross income. A married couple in 2018, whose total income was just shy of $24,350, of which exactly $3,500 was investment income, would receive the maximum credit for their number of qualifying children (i.e. $6,431 with 3 kids). But if this couple instead had $3,501 of investment income, then — because of the rule that for any claimant, whether single or married, with or without children, investment income cannot be greater than $3,500 — they will instead receive zero EIC. This is a loss of up to $6,431 due to one extra dollar of investment income, and the loss is nearly twice the entire amount of the couple's investment income. This is an edge case, but there are income ranges and situations in which an increase of investment dollars will result in a loss of after-tax dollars. (Instead of $24,350, the phase-out for Single, Head of Household, and Qualifying Widow(er) begins at $18,700.) In normal circumstances, EIC phases out relatively slowly, at 16% or 21% depending on the number of children. == Disallowances for reckless or fraudulent claims == A person or couple will be disallowed EIC for two years if they claim EIC when not eligible and the IRS determines the \\"error is due to reckless or intentional disregard of the EIC rules.\\" A person or couple will be disallowed for ten years if they make a fraudulent claim. Form 8862 is required after this time period in order to be reinstated. However, this form is not required if EIC was reduced solely because of mathematical or clerical error.1040 Instructions 2010, see caution note on page 45. See also \\"Form 8862, who must file\\" on page 48. == Example(s) for 2012 from IRS Pub. 596 == Cynthia and Jerry Grey have two children ages 6 and 8. For tax year 2012, one spouse made $10,000 in wages and the other spouse made $15,000, plus the couple received $525 on interest from a savings account. Since they are into the phase-out range, their EIC will phase out by the greater of earned income or adjusted gross income. So, they will look up in the EIC table $25,525 for MFJ with two children, and this amount is $4,557. Since they are claiming children, the Greys will also need to attach Schedule EIC to their tax return which will ask for each child, the child's name, social security number, year of birth, relationship to couple, and months lived with couple in the United States during 2012. If the Greys use 1040A, they will enter $4,557 on line 38a. If they use form 1040, they will enter $4,557 on line 64a. ==Graph, 2006Tax Credit for case of one qualifying child=== *Tax credit equals $0.34 for each dollar of earned income for income up to $8050. *For income between $8050 and $16,800, the tax credit is constant at $2747. *For income between $16,800 and $34,001, the tax credit decreases by $0.1598 for each dollar earned over $16,800. *For income over $34,001, the tax credit is zero. 600px == Impact Welfare benefits=== Under traditional welfare, a dollar-for-dollar decrease of benefits corresponded to an increase in earnings. Standard indifference curve analysis shows that this creates a \\"spiked\\" budget constraint of OABC, making it very likely that an individual's utility maximizing bundle includes no work. The EITC, in contrast to traditional welfare, creates a \\"smoother\\" budget constraint of OABCD, making it theoretically much more likely that an individual's utility-maximizing bundle will include some hours of work. At a cost of $56 billion in 2013, the EITC is the third-largest social welfare program in the United States after Medicaid ($275 billion federal and $127 billion state expenditures) and food stamps ($78 billion).Federal spending by the Numbers 2013 accessed 22 Nov 2013 Almost 27 million American households received more than $56 billion in payments through the EITC in 2010. These EITC dollars had a significant impact on the lives and communities of the nation's lowest-paid working people largely repaying any payroll taxes they may have paid. The EITC is one of the most effective social welfare programs in the United States. The Census Bureau, using an alternative calculation of poverty, found that EITC lifted 5.4 million above the poverty line in 2010. The stimulus effects of the EITC and other consumption-augmenting policies have been challenged by more recent and rigorous studies. Haskell (2006) finds that the unique spending patterns of lump-sum tax credit recipients and the increasingly global supply chain for consumer goods is counter-productive to producing high, localized multipliers. He places the local multiplier effect somewhere in the range of 1.07 to 1.15, more in line with typical economic returns. The lower multiplier is due to recipients emphasizing \\"big-ticket\\" durable-good purchases, which are typically produced elsewhere, versus locally produced products and services such as agricultural products or restaurant visits. However, Haskell points to a silver lining: there are perhaps more important benefits from recipients who use the credit for savings or investment in big-ticket purchases that promote social mobility, such as automobiles, school tuition, or health-care services. Due to its structure, the EITC is effective at targeting assistance to low-income families in the bottom two quintiles—0–40% of households. By contrast, only 30% of minimum wage workers live in families near or below the federal poverty line, as most are teenagers, young adults, students, or spouses supplementing their studies or family income. Opponents of the minimum wage argue that it is a less efficient means to help the poor than adjusting the EITC. EITC follows a graphical benefit pattern of going up a hill, traveling along a plateau, and then going back down the hill more slowly than it went up. For example, a married couple with two qualifying children and yearly income of seven thousand dollars will receive EITC of $2,810 (going up the hill). At fifteen thousand dollars, this couple will receive EITC of $5,036 (plateau). And at twenty-five and thirty-five thousand dollars, this same couple with their two children will receive EITC of $4,285 and $2,179, respectively. A single person (such as a single parent, aunt, uncle, grandparent, older sibling, etc.) goes up the hill at the same rate and will receive the same maximum EITC for two qualifying children of $5,036 at plateau. But the single person has a shorter plateau. And thus, a single person with two qualifying children and income of twenty-five and thirty-five thousand will receive EITC of $3,230 and $1,124 respectively (going down the hill). EITC phases out at 16% with one qualifying child and at 21% for two children and three or more children. Thus it is always preferable to have an extra fifty dollars of actual earned income (the table for EITC steps in increments of fifty dollars). The GRAPHICAL plateau range for Married Filing Jointly continues for five thousand dollars longer than does the plateau for the other filing statuses and thus MFJ can be advantageous for some income ranges. Single, Head of Household, and Qualifying Widow(er) are all equally valid and eligible filing statuses for claiming EITC. The only disqualifying status is Married Filing Separately. However, a couple can file as Married Filing Jointly even if they lived apart for the entire year if legally married and both agree. ===Impact on health=== A 2013 systematic review of the effect of in-work tax credits on health outcomes in adults conducted through the Cochrane Collaboration found no evidence for an effect of the EITC on health outcomes (except for mixed evidence favoring a reduction of tobacco smoking) in adults. However, the study concluded that further evidence is required to establish the effects of EITC on health outcomes with confidence. === Working mothers === According to a 2020 study, the introduction of the EITC increased maternal employment by 6 percent. The EITC may explain why the United States has high levels of maternal employment, despite the absence of childcare subsidies or parental leave. == Cost == The direct cost of the EITC to the U.S. federal government was about $56 billion in 2012. The IRS has estimated that between 21% and 25% of this cost ($11.6 to $13.6 billion) is due to EITC payments that were issued improperly to recipients who did not qualify for the EITC benefit that they received. For the 2013 tax year the IRS paid an estimated $13.6 billion in bogus claims. In total the IRS has overpaid as much as $132.6 billion in EITC over the last ten years. The direct fiscal cost of the EITC may be partially offset by two factors: any new taxes (such as payroll taxes paid by employers) generated by new workers drawn by the EITC into the labor force; and taxes generated on additional spending done by families receiving earned income tax credit. Some economists have noted that the EITC might conceivably cause reductions in entitlement spending that result from individuals being lifted out of poverty by their EITC benefit check. However, because the pre-tax income determines eligibility for most state and federal benefits, the EITC rarely changes a taxpayer's eligibility for state or federal aid benefits. == Uncollected tax credits == Millions of American families who are eligible for the EITC do not receive it, essentially leaving billions of dollars unclaimed. The IRS estimates that about 20 percent of eligible taxpayers do not claim $7.3 billion of Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) each tax year. Many nonprofit organizations around the United States, sometimes in partnership with government and with some public financing, have begun programs designed to increase EITC utilization by raising awareness of the credit and assisting with the filing of the relevant tax forms. One example is the Claim it! campaign in Minnesota that launched in 2006 to help Minnesotans claim the EITC. The state of California requires employers to notify every employee about the EITC every year, in writing, at the same time W-2 forms are distributed. ==Storefront tax prep, “RACs,” prep and account fees, third-party debt collection== RALs (Refund Anticipation Loans) are short term loans on the security of an expected tax refund, and RACs (Refund Anticipation Checks) are temporary accounts specifically to wait to receive tax refunds, which are then paid by a check or debit card from the bank less fees. The combination of Earned Income Credit, RALs, and RACs has created a major market for the storefront tax preparation industry. A 2002 Brookings Institution study of Cleveland taxpayers found that 47 percent of filers claiming EIC purchased RALs, as compared to 10 percent of those not claiming EIC. The tax preparation industry responded that at least one-half of RAL customers included in the IRS data actually received RACs instead.NATIONAL TAXPAYER ADVOCATE: 2005 ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS, VOLUME 1, 31 December 2005, page 166 (174 in PDF file).

These financial products have been criticized on various grounds, including inflated prices for tax preparation, account fees, RAL interest rates, as well as the practice of third-party debt collection (this used to be called \\"cross-collection\\" which hinted at the practice, but tax prep companies now to seem more vaguely refer to the practice merely as \\"previous debt\\").National Taxpayer Advocate 2005 Annual Report to Congress, Executive Summary, The Most Serious Problems Encountered by Taxpayers, page I-3, item 8. Refund Anticipation Loans: Oversight of the Industry, Cross-Collection Techniques, and Payment Alternatives: \\" . . . It is also unclear if RAL customers fully understand the ramifications of cross-collection provisions in standardized RAL contracts . . . \\"RALs drain off millions in taxpayer refunds, National Consumer Law Center, published by consumer-action.org, February 5, 2007. This practice occurs when one RAL- or RAC-issuing bank collects for another. That is, such lenders may take all or part of a client's current year tax refund for purposes of third- party debt collection, and it is unclear how broad are the types of debts for which the banks collect.National Taxpayer Advocate’s 2007 Objectives Report to Congress, Volume II, The Role Of The IRS In The Refund Anticipation Loan Industry, pages 10–12, June 30, 2006. In part, this report states: “ . . It is also interesting to note that federal law prohibits banks from exercising their right to offset Social Security benefits for the recipients’ defaulted loans to that bank. It would make sense to protect EITC funds in a similar manner. . ” (page 11, last three sentences). However, in many cases, tax preparation clients are not even informed of the practice of cross-collection (see second paragraph of “Debt Collection Offset Practice,” page 10). This contrasts with the more limited types of debt collected for by the IRS. This practice of one bank collecting debt for another may not be adequately disclosed to the tax preparation client; on the other hand, some clients may fail to disclose obligations that result a governmental seizure of their refunds.Attorney General Lockyer Files Lawsuit Against H&R; Block for Illegally Marketing and Selling High-Cost Loans as ‘Instant' Tax Refunds, State of California, Office of Attorney General, news release, Feb. 15, 2006. With both RALs and RACs, the client grants the bank first rights to their tax refund, and both carry the same risk of third-party bank collection. Advertisement phrases such as \\"Rapid Refund\\" have been deemed deceptive and illegal, since these financial products do not speed remittances beyond the routine automation of tax return processing, and do not make it clear that these are loan applications. Beginning with 2011 tax season, the IRS announced that they would no longer provide preparers and financial institutions with the “debt indicator” that assisted banks in determining whether RAL applications were approved.IRS to end release of taxpayer debt information, EILEEN AJ CONNELLY (Associated Press), Friday, August 6, 2010.IRS Removes Debt Indicator for 2011 Tax Filing Season, (IRS press notice), IR-2010-89, Aug. 5, 2010. IRS Commissioner Doug Shulman said, “Refund Anticipation Loans are often targeted at lower-income taxpayers.” Beginning with the 2013 tax season, major banks are no longer offering RALs but only RACs.Refund Anticipation Loans Come With Risks, Better Business Bureau, 2/26/2013.

' However, a March 2013 article in CNN Money reported that tax prep companies are offering a hodgepodge of financial products similar to RALs. The article further states that, \\"The NCLC [National Consumer Law Center] also found that some shady tax preparers are even offering tax refund loans to lure taxpayers into their offices, but have no intention of lending them the money.\\"New tax refund loans carry sky-high fees and rates, CNNMoney, Blake Ellis, March 6, 2013. ==See also== * Capital gains tax * Guaranteed minimum income * Negative income tax * Refund anticipation loan * Taxation in the United States * Unearned income ==References Further reading == * ==External links== Taxpayer info/tools: *IRS EITC Assistant, which can help determine if one qualifies for EITC *IRS 1040 Instructions 2010, Earned Income Credit instructions on pages 45–48, optional worksheets 49–51, credit table itself 51–58.

This was because the 2008 Indy Japan 300 occurred on the same weekend and there was no way of changing dates to avoid the clash. It was held on April 20, 2008, at the street circuit in Long Beach, California, United States. The race was historic in that Will Power became the last ever winner of a Champ Car-style race. The contingent of former Champ Car teams produced a 20-car field, all utilizing the turbocharged Panoz DP01-Cosworth for the final time. All participants entering other IndyCar races earned points towards the 2008 IndyCar Series championship. All the teams raced together again a week later at Kansas Speedway, and for the remainder of the schedule together. The race was run under Champ Car rules, which included the standing start, option tire, two-day qualifying format, ran on time (1 hour, 45 minutes) rather than a set number of laps. The option tire rule was adopted by the IRL for 2009, as well as standing starts for selected road and street course races in 2013 and 2014 only to be abandoned in 2015 due to safety concerns. The race was broadcast on ESPN2 using ABC's IndyCar Series broadcast crew, who also broadcast the 2008 Indy Japan 300 the previous evening (7 PM) from Long Beach (with the exception of Jack Arute, who was assigned to Motegi). Several IRL staff and team personnel had flown back from Japan Sunday afternoon (local time) and saw at least part of the race, including Motegi winner Danica Patrick, who had scored her historic win the previous evening. ==Results== {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" - !

The pair both started grade four on the same day at the same new school, Preshil: The Margaret Lyttle Memorial School. Their original relationship was bitter, as Josie recalls the two had \\"hated each other for quite a few years\\". At age twelve, they began performing together and in year nine (age fourteen), Charlie and Josie were awarded a small financial grant to record a professional demo of their original songs.http://videohits.ten.com.au/artists- dash-and-will.htm The following year, in 2005, Josie's dad was talking to the father of one of the girl's classmates, Barry Palmer a Melbourne-based producer and former guitarist with Hunters & Collectors and Deadstar. Not long after, Palmer contacted the girls and asked if they would come into the studio for a chat and live performance. He then signed the duo to his music production company, Gigantically Small, and they would eventually sign to Mercury Records through Universal Music Australia. Dash and Will headlined the 2008 Rock the Schools tour across New South Wales in May, as well as supporting Ben Lee, Matt Costa and Faker's Nathan Hudson.http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Dash_and_Will.php Their first single, \\"Pick You Up\\", was released in May 2008, and second single \\"Fighting Over Nothing\\" was released in October 2008. Dash and Will supported British indie rockers The Kooks on their Australian tour in August and September 2008 as well as The Futureheads, End of Fashion and Van She. They were also on the bill to play the long-running summer festivals Homebake and Falls Festival, also playing on The Other Stage at Southbound in 2009.(http://www.sunsetevents.com.au/sites/southbound/times-and-map.html In September 2008, the duo's version of The Easybeats' \\"Somethin' Wrong\\" was released on Easy Fever, a compilation of The Easybeats' classic songs performed by Australian and New Zealand artists. Dash & Will once again supported The Kooks on their second tour of Australia in January 2009, as well as supporting another UK band The Ting Tings. The duo found exposure through appearances on numerous Australian television programs, including children show Saturday Disney and music quiz shows RocKwiz and 'Spicks and Specks'. They also hosted four episodes of a music based show for kids, The Go Show, on the Foxtel channel Nickelodeon. They released their debut studio album, Up in Something, in August 2009.

In 2014 the percent of national wealth owned by the government was 24%.Public Wealth in the US and Nordic Countries Due to Sweden being a neutral country that did not actively participate in World War II, it did not have to rebuild its economic base, banking system, and country as a whole, as did many other European countries. Sweden has achieved a high standard of living under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits.

A comparison of upcoming economic growth rates of EU countries revealed that the Baltic states, Poland, and Slovakia are the only countries that are expected to keep comparable or higher growth rates. ==History== In the 19th century Sweden evolved from a largely agricultural economy into the beginnings of an industrialized, urbanized country. Poverty was still widespread. However, incomes were sufficiently high to finance emigration to distant places, prompting a large portion of the country to leave, especially to the United States. Economic reforms and the creation of a modern economic system, banks and corporations were enacted during the later half of the 19th century. During that time Sweden was in a way the \\"powerhouse\\" of the Scandinavian region with a strong industrialization process commencing in the 1860s. Moreover, the Swedish Riksdag had developed into a very active Parliament already during the Age of Liberty (1719–72), and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of said century. Apart from relatively high levels of human capital formation, the result of the Reformation and related government policies, such local democratic traditions were the other asset that made the \\"catching up\\" of the Scandinavian countries, including Sweden, possible and this economic rise was probably the most remarkable phenomenon in that region during the nineteenth century. By the 1930s, Sweden had what Life magazine called in 1938 the \\"world's highest standard of living\\". Sweden declared itself neutral during both world wars, thereby avoiding much physical destruction and instead, especially after the First World War, profiting from the new circumstances – such as booming demand for raw materials and foodstuffs and the disappearance of international competition for its exports. The postwar boom, that was the continuation of strong inflationary tendencies during the war itself, propelled Sweden to greater economic prosperity. Beginning in the 1970s and culminating with the deep recession of the early 1990s, Swedish standards of living developed less favorably than many other industrialized countries. Since the mid-1990s the economic performance has improved. In 2009, Sweden had the world's tenth highest GDP per capita in nominal terms and was in 14th place in terms of purchasing power parity. ===Crisis of the 1990s=== Sweden has had an economic model in the post-World War II era characterized by close cooperation between the government, labour unions, and corporations. The Swedish economy has extensive and universal social benefits funded by high taxes, close to 50% of GDP. In the 1980s, a real estate and financial bubble formed, driven by a rapid increase in lending. A restructuring of the tax system, in order to emphasize low inflation combined with an international economic slowdown in the early 1990s, caused the bubble to burst. Between 1990 and 1993 GDP went down by 5% and unemployment skyrocketed, causing the worst economic crisis in Sweden since the 1930s. According to an analysis published in Computer Sweden in 1992, the investment level decreased drastically for information technology and computing equipment, except in the financial and banking sector, the part of the industry that created the crisis. The investment levels for IT and computers were restored as early as 1993. In 1992 there was a run on the currency, the central bank briefly jacking up interest to 500% in an unsuccessful effort to defend the currency's fixed exchange rate.Krona's Fall Threatens a New Currency Crisis in Europe – International Herald Tribune Total employment fell by almost 10% during the crisis. A real estate boom ended in a bust. The government took over nearly a quarter of banking assets at a cost of about 4% of the nation's GDP. This was known colloquially as the \\"Stockholm Solution\\". In 2007, the United States Federal Reserve noted, \\"In the early 1970s, Sweden had one of the highest income levels in Europe; today, its lead has all but disappeared...So, even well-managed financial crises don't really have a happy ending\\". The welfare system that had been growing rapidly since the 1970s could not be sustained with a falling GDP, lower employment and larger welfare payments. In 1994 the government budget deficit exceeded 15% of GDP. The response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness. When the international economic outlook improved combined with a rapid growth in the IT sector, which Sweden was well positioned to capitalize on, the country was able to emerge from the crisis. The crisis of the 1990s was by some viewed as the end of the much buzzed welfare model called \\"Svenska modellen\\", literally \\"The Swedish Model\\", as it proved that governmental spending at the levels previously experienced in Sweden was not long term sustainable in a global open economy.

Fe – iron ore, PY – pyrite, Cu – copper, Zn – zinc, As – arsenic, Ag – silver, Au – gold, Pb – lead, U – uranium; in red: C – coal, OS – oil shale Sweden is an export-oriented mixed economy featuring a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber, hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Sweden's engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. Telecommunications, the automotive industry and the pharmaceutical industries are also of great importance. Agriculture accounts for 2 percent of GDP and employment. The armaments industry has a technologically highly advanced reputation. The 20 largest Sweden-registered companies by turnover were Volvo, Ericsson, Vattenfall, Skanska, Hennes & Mauritz, Electrolux, Volvo Personvagnar, Preem, TeliaSonera, Sandvik, ICA, Atlas Copco, Nordea, Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget, Scania, Securitas, Nordstjernan, SKF, ABB Norden Holding, and Sony Mobile Communications AB.20 largest companies in Sweden Sweden's industry is overwhelmingly in public and state control, the most prominent example of this is LKAB, a state-owned mining company, mostly active in the northern part of the country, with the largest noted market share out of all its domestic competitors. Some 4.5 million residents are working, out of which around a third have a tertiary education. GDP per hour worked is the world's 9th- highest at 31 USD in 2006, compared to 22 USD in Spain and 35 USD in United States. According to the OECD, deregulation, globalization, and technology- sector growth have been key drivers of productivity. GDP per hour worked is growing per cent a year for the economy as a whole and trade-terms-balanced productivity growth 2%. Sweden is a world leader in privatized pensions, and pension-funding problems are small compared to many other Western European countries.Pension Reform in Sweden: Lessons for American Policymakers by Goran Normann, PhD and Daniel J. Mitchell, PhD 29 June 2000. The Swedish labor market has become more flexible, but it still has some widely acknowledged problems. The typical worker receives only 40% of his income after the tax wedge. The slowly declining overall taxation, 51% of GDP in 2007, is still nearly double of that in the United States or Ireland. Civil servants amount to a third of Swedish workforce, multiple times the proportion in many other countries. Overall, GDP growth has been fast since reforms in the early 1990s, especially in manufacturing.OECD Economic Surveys: Sweden – Volume 2005 Issue 9 by OECD Publishing World Economic Forum 2012–2013 competitiveness index ranks Sweden 4th most competitive. The Index of Economic Freedom 2012 ranks Sweden the 21st most free out of 179 countries, or 10th out of 43 European countries. Sweden ranked 9th in the IMD Competitiveness Yearbook 2008, scoring high in private sector efficiency. According to the book, The Flight of the Creative Class, by the U.S. urban studies, Professor Richard Florida of University of Toronto, Sweden is ranked as having the best creativity in Europe for business and is predicted to become a talent magnet for the world's most purposeful workers. The book compiled an index to measure the kind of creativity it claims is most useful to business – talent, technology and tolerance.\\"\\"Sweden most creative country in Europe & top talent hotspot\\" , Invest in Sweden Agency, 25 June 2005. Sweden's investment into research and development stood, in 2007, at over 3.5% of GDP. This is considerably higher than that of a number of MEDCs, including the United States, and is the largest among the OECD members. Sweden rejected the Euro in a referendum in 2003, and Sweden maintains its own currency, the Swedish krona (SEK). The Swedish Riksbankfounded in 1668 and thus making it the oldest central bank in the worldis currently focusing on price stability with its inflation target of 2%. According to Economic Survey of Sweden 2007 by OECD, the average inflation in Sweden has been one of the lowest among European countries since the mid-1990s, largely because of deregulation and quick utilization of globalization.Economic survey of Sweden 2007 The largest trade flows are with Germany, United States, Norway, United Kingdom, Denmark and Finland. The Swedish economic picture has brightened significantly since the severe recession in the early 1990s. Growth has been strong in recent years, and even though the growth in the economy slackened between 2001 and 2003, the growth rate has picked up since with an average growth rate of 3.7% in the last three years. The long-run prospects for growth remain favorable. The inflation rate is low and stable, with projections for continued low levels over the next 2–3 years. Since the mid-1990s the export sector has been booming, acting as the main engine for economic growth. Swedish exports also have proven to be surprisingly robust. A marked shift in the structure of the exports, where services, the IT industry, and telecommunications have taken over from traditional industries such as steel, paper and pulp, has made the Swedish export sector less vulnerable to international fluctuations. However, at the same time the Swedish industry has received less money for its exports while the import prices have gone up. During the period 1995–2003 the export prices were reduced by 4% at the same time as the import prices climbed by 11%. The net effect is that the Swedish terms-of-trade fell 13%.http://sn.svensktnaringsliv.se/sn/Press.nsf/0/C2946EB9F1400D0EC1256FB6004F7CE6/$File/prm050228.pdf By 2014, legislators, economists and the IMF were warning of a bubble with residential property prices soaring and the level of personal mortgage debt expanding. Household debt-to-income rose above 170% as the IMF called on legislators to consider zoning reform and other means of generating a greater supply of housing as demand was outstripping supply. By August 2014, 40% of home borrowers had interest-only loans while those that didn't were repaying principal at a rate that would take 100 years to fully repay. ===Government=== The government budget has improved dramatically from a record deficit of more than 12% of GDP in 1993. In the last decade, from 1998 to present, the government has run a surplus every year, except for 2003 and 2004. The surplus for 2011 is expected to be 99 billion ($15b) kronor. The new, strict budget process with spending ceilings set by the Riksdag, and a constitutional change to an independent Central Bank, have greatly improved policy credibility. From the perspective of longer-term fiscal sustainability, the long-awaited reform of old-age pensions entered into force in 1999. This entails a far more robust system vis-à-vis adverse demographic and economic trends, which should keep the ratio of total pension disbursements to the aggregate wage bill close to 20% in the decades ahead. Taken together, both fiscal consolidation and pension reform have brought public finances back on a sustainable footing. Gross public debt, which jumped from 43% of GDP in 1990 to 78% in 1994, stabilised around the middle of the 1990s and started to come down again more significantly beginning in 1999. In 2000 it fell below the key level of 60% and had declined to a level of 35% of GDP as of 2010. ==Economic and monetary union== Current economic development reflects a quite remarkable improvement of the Swedish economy since the crisis in 1991–93, so that Sweden could easily qualify for membership in the third phase of the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, adopting the euro as its currency. In theory, by the rules of the EMU, Sweden is obliged to join, since the country has not obtained exception by any protocol or treaty (as opposed to Denmark and the United Kingdom). Nevertheless, the Swedish government decided in 1997 against joining the common currency from its start on 1 January 1999. This choice was implemented by exploiting a legal loophole, deliberately staying out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. This move is currently tolerated by the European Central Bank, which however has warned that this would not be the case for newer EU members. In the first years of the twenty-first century, a majority for joining emerged in the governing Social Democratic party, although the question was subject of heated debate, with leading personalities in the party on both sides. On 14 September 2003, a national referendum was held on the euro. A 56% majority of Swedes rejected the common currency, while 42% voted in favour of it. Currently no plans for a new referendum or parliamentary vote on the matter are being discussed, though it has been implied that another referendum may take place in around ten years. ==Unemployment== In contrast with most other European countries, Sweden maintained an unemployment rate around 2% or 3% of the work force throughout the 1980s. This was, however, accompanied by high and accelerating inflation. It became evident that such low unemployment rates were not sustainable, and in the severe crisis of the early 1990s the rate increased to more than 8%. In 1996 the government set out a goal of reducing unemployment to 4% by 2000. During 2000 employment rose by 90,000 people, the greatest increase in 40 years, and the goal was reached in the autumn of 2000. The same autumn the government set out its new target: that 80% of the working age population will have a regular job by 2004. Some have expressed concern that meeting the employment target may come at a cost of too high a rate of wage increases hence increasing inflation. However, as of August 2006, roughly 5% of working age Swedes were unemployed, over the government-established goal. However, some of the people who cannot find work are put away in so-called \\"labour market political activities\\", referred to as \\"AMS-åtgärder\\". According to Jan Edling, a former trade-unionist, the actual number of unemployed is far higher, and those figures are being suppressed by both the government and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation. In Edling's report he added that a further 3% of Swedes were occupied in state-organised job schemes, not in the private sector. He also claimed a further 700,000 Swedes are either on long-term sick leave or in early retirement. Edling asks how many of these people are in fact unemployed. According to his report, the \\"actual unemployment\\" rate hovers near 20%.Alla behövs Pdf file Some critics disagree with this concept of \\"actual\\" unemployment, also termed \\"broad unemployment\\", since they do not see e.g. students who rather want a job, people on sick leave and military conscripts as \\"unemployed\\". According to Swedish Statistics, unemployment in June 2013 was 9.1% in the general population and 29% amongst 15- to 25-year- olds. ==Trade unions== Around seventy percent of the Swedish labour force is unionised.Arbetsgivarna starkare än fackföreningarna. DN.SE (18 June 2009). Retrieved on 2013-01-29. For most unions there is a counterpart employer's organization for businesses. The unions and employer organisations are independent of both the government and political parties, although the largest confederation of unions, the National Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions or LO (organising blue-collar workers), maintains close links to one of the three major parties, the Social Democrats. The unionisation rate among white-collar workers is exceptionally high in Sweden – since 2008 higher than for blue- collar workers. In 2019, blue-collar density was 60%, and white-collar density was 72% (full-time students working part-time excluded). Just before the considerably raised fees to union unemployment funds in January 2007, blue- collar and white-collar union density was the same (77% in 2006).Anders Kjellberg (2020) Kollektivavtalens täckningsgrad samt organisationsgraden hos arbetsgivarförbund och fackförbund, Department of Sociology, Lund University.

No 1 (August 2011), pp. 67-93 The average union density was 70% in the years 2011-2014, 69% in 2015-2017 and 68% in 2018 and 2019. There are two major confederations that organise professionals and other qualified employees: the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (Tjänstemännens Centralorganisation or TCO) and the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations (Sveriges Akademikers Centralorganisation or SACO). They are both independent from Sweden's political parties and never endorse candidates for office in political elections. There is no minimum wage that is required by legislation. Instead, minimum wage standards in different sectors are normally set by collective bargaining. About 90% of all workers are covered by collective agreements, in the private sector 83% (2018).Anders Kjellberg (2020) Kollektivavtalens täckningsgrad samt organisationsgraden hos arbetsgivarförbund och fackförbund, Department of Sociology, Lund University.

Research Reports 2020:1, Appendix 3 (in English) Table F Anders Kjellberg (2019) \\"Sweden: collective bargaining under the industry norm\\", in Torsten Müller & Kurt Vandaele & Jeremy Waddington (eds.) Collective bargaining in Europe: towards an endgame, European Trade Union Institute (ETUI) Brussels 2019. Vol. III (pp. 583-604) The high coverage of collective agreements is achieved despite the absence of state mechanisms extending collective agreements to whole industries or sectors. This reflects the dominance of self-regulation (regulation by the labour market parties themselves) over state regulation in Swedish industrial relations.Anders Kjellberg (2017) ”Self-regulation versus State Regulation in Swedish Industrial Relations” In Mia Rönnmar and Jenny Julén Votinius (eds.) Festskrift till Ann Numhauser-Henning. Lund: Juristförlaget i Lund 2017, pp. 357-383 Sweden has not joined the EMU (the Economic and Monetary Union / the Euro) and will not in the foreseeable future. When the issue was at the agenda, the Swedish union movement was very split.Kjellberg, Anders (2000) \\"The Multitude of Challenges Facing Swedish Trade Unions\\", in Jeremy Waddington & Reiner Hoffmann (eds.) Trade Unions in Europe: Facing Challenges and Searching For Solutions, Bryssels: European Trade Union Institute, pp. 529-573, in particular pp. 544-547. In contrast to the very positive attitude of employers' associations, the union rank-and file opinion was so split that several unions, as well as the confederations LO, TCO and SACO, abstained from taking an official position. ==Labour force== The traditionally low wage differential has increased in recent years as a result of increased flexibility as the role of wage setting at the company level has strengthened somewhat. Still, Swedish unskilled employees are well paid while well educated Swedish employees are low-paid compared with those in competitor countries in Western Europe and the US. The average increases in real wages in recent years have been high by historical standards, in large part due to unforeseen price stability. Even so, nominal wages in recent years have been slightly above those in competitor countries. Thus, while private-sector wages rose by an average annual rate of 3.75% from 1998 to 2000 in Sweden, the comparable increase for the EU area was 1.75%. In the year 2000 the total labour force was around 4.4 million people. ==Ongoing and finished privatisations== The Swedish government has announced that it will privatise a number of wholly and partly state owned companies. \\"The income from these sales will be used to pay off the government debt and reduce the burden of debt for future generations. The Government's ambition is to sell companies to a value of SEK 200 billion during 2007–2010.\\" ;Ongoing Privatisations: * Telia Sonera – telecom. 37.3% owned by the Swedish government.

The Minister of Enterprise, Mikael Damberg stated that \\"There exists good reasons for the Swedish government not be a long-term owner of a publicly traded airline...

The timing of the Great Depression varied across the world; in most countries, it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s.John A. Garraty, The Great Depression (1986) It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century.Charles Duhigg, \\"Depression, You Say? Check Those Safety Nets\\", The New York Times, March 23, 2008. The Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how intensely the global economy can decline.Barry Eichengreen, Hall of Mirrors: The Great Depression, The Great Recession, and the Uses-and Misuses-of History (2014) The Great Depression started in the United States after a major fall in stock prices that began around September 4, 1929, and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929, (known as Black Tuesday). Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession.Roger Lowenstein, \\"History Repeating,\\" Wall Street Journal Jan 14, 2015 Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II.Garraty, Great Depression (1986) ch1 The Great Depression had devastating effects in both rich and poor countries. Personal income, tax revenue, profits and prices dropped, while international trade fell by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 23% and in some countries rose as high as 33%. Cities around the world were hit hard, especially those dependent on heavy industry. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by about 60%. Facing plummeting demand with few alternative sources of jobs, areas dependent on primary sector industries such as mining and logging suffered the most.Mitchell, Depression Decade ==Start== Dow Jones Industrial, 1928–30 Economic historians usually consider the catalyst of the Great Depression to be the sudden devastating collapse of U.S. stock market prices, starting on October 24, 1929. However,Great Depression, Encyclopædia Britannica some dispute this conclusion and see the stock crash as a symptom, rather than a cause, of the Great Depression. Even after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 optimism persisted for some time. John D. Rockefeller said \\"These are days when many are discouraged. In the 93 years of my life, depressions have come and gone. Prosperity has always returned and will again.\\" The stock market turned upward in early 1930, returning to early 1929 levels by April. This was still almost 30% below the peak of September 1929. Together, the government and business spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the corresponding period of the previous year. On the other hand, consumers, many of whom had suffered severe losses in the stock market the previous year, cut back their expenditures by 10%. In addition, beginning in the mid-1930s, a severe drought ravaged the agricultural heartland of the U.S. Interest rates had dropped to low levels by mid-1930, but expected deflation and the continuing reluctance of people to borrow meant that consumer spending and investment were depressed. By May 1930, automobile sales had declined to below the levels of 1928. Prices, in general, began to decline, although wages held steady in 1930. Then a deflationary spiral started in 1931. Farmers faced a worse outlook; declining crop prices and a Great Plains drought crippled their economic outlook. At its peak, the Great Depression saw nearly 10% of all Great Plains farms change hands despite federal assistance. The decline in the U.S. economy was the factor that pulled down most other countries at first; then, internal weaknesses or strengths in each country made conditions worse or better. Frantic attempts by individual countries to shore up their economies through protectionist policies – such as the 1930 U.S. Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act and retaliatory tariffs in other states – exacerbated the collapse in global trade, contributing to the depression. By 1933, the economic decline had pushed world trade to one third of its level just four years earlier. ===Economic indicators=== Change in economic indicators 1929–32Jerome Blum, Rondo Cameron, Thomas G.

Crowd gathering at the intersection of Wall Street and Broad Street after the 1929 crash U.S. industrial production (1928–39) The two classic competing economic theories of the Great Depression are the Keynesian (demand-driven) and the monetarist explanation. There are also various heterodox theories that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists. The consensus among demand-driven theories is that a large- scale loss of confidence led to a sudden reduction in consumption and investment spending. Once panic and deflation set in, many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets. Holding money became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods, exacerbating the drop in demand. Monetarists believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but the shrinking of the money supply greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression. Economists and economic historians are almost evenly split as to whether the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right, or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending, particularly investment, is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression. Today there is also significant academic support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that — building on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz — add non-monetary explanations. There is a consensus that the Federal Reserve System should have cut short the process of monetary deflation and banking collapse, by expanding the money supply and acting as lender of last resort. If they had done this, the economic downturn would have been far less severe and much shorter. ===Mainstream explanations=== Modern mainstream economists see the reasons in * Insufficient demand from the private sector and insufficient fiscal spending (Keynesians). * A money supply reduction (Monetarists) and therefore a banking crisis, reduction of credit and bankruptcies. Insufficient spending, the money supply reduction, and debt on margin led to falling prices and further bankruptcies (Irving Fisher's debt deflation). Keynesian View British economist John Maynard Keynes argued in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money that lower aggregate expenditures in the economy contributed to a massive decline in income and to employment that was well below the average. In such a situation, the economy reached equilibrium at low levels of economic activity and high unemployment. Keynes's basic idea was simple: to keep people fully employed, governments have to run deficits when the economy is slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep production at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession. Keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis to pick up the slack by increasing government spending or cutting taxes. As the Depression wore on, Franklin D. Roosevelt tried public works, farm subsidies, and other devices to restart the U.S. economy, but never completely gave up trying to balance the budget. According to the Keynesians, this improved the economy, but Roosevelt never spent enough to bring the economy out of recession until the start of World War II.; Monetarist View The Great Depression in the U.S. from a monetary view. Real gross domestic product in 1996-Dollar (blue), price index (red), money supply M2 (green) and number of banks (grey). All data adjusted to 1929 = 100%. Crowd at New York's American Union Bank during a bank run early in the Great Depression The monetarist explanation was given by American economists Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz.A Monetary History of the United States, 1857-1960. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1963. They argued that the Great Depression was caused by the banking crisis that caused one-third of all banks to vanish, a reduction of bank shareholder wealth and more importantly monetary contraction of 35%, which they called \\"The Great Contraction\\". This caused a price drop of 33% (deflation).Randall E. Parker (2003), Reflections on the Great Depression, Edward Elgar Publishing, , pp. 11–12 By not lowering interest rates, by not increasing the monetary base and by not injecting liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling, the Federal Reserve passively watched the transformation of a normal recession into the Great Depression. Friedman and Schwartz argued that the downward turn in the economy, starting with the stock market crash, would merely have been an ordinary recession if the Federal Reserve had taken aggressive action. This view was endorsed by Federal Reserve Governor Ben Bernanke in a speech honoring Friedman and Schwartz with this statement: The Federal Reserve allowed some large public bank failures – particularly that of the New York Bank of United States – which produced panic and widespread runs on local banks, and the Federal Reserve sat idly by while banks collapsed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that, if the Fed had provided emergency lending to these key banks, or simply bought government bonds on the open market to provide liquidity and increase the quantity of money after the key banks fell, all the rest of the banks would not have fallen after the large ones did, and the money supply would not have fallen as far and as fast as it did. With significantly less money to go around, businesses could not get new loans and could not even get their old loans renewed, forcing many to stop investing. This interpretation blames the Federal Reserve for inaction, especially the New York branch. One reason why the Federal Reserve did not act to limit the decline of the money supply was the gold standard. At that time, the amount of credit the Federal Reserve could issue was limited by the Federal Reserve Act, which required 40% gold backing of Federal Reserve Notes issued. By the late 1920s, the Federal Reserve had almost hit the limit of allowable credit that could be backed by the gold in its possession. This credit was in the form of Federal Reserve demand notes.Frank Freidel (1973), Franklin D. Roosevelt: Launching the New Deal, ch. 19, Little, Brown & Co. A \\"promise of gold\\" is not as good as \\"gold in the hand\\", particularly when they only had enough gold to cover 40% of the Federal Reserve Notes outstanding. During the bank panics, a portion of those demand notes was redeemed for Federal Reserve gold. Since the Federal Reserve had hit its limit on allowable credit, any reduction in gold in its vaults had to be accompanied by a greater reduction in credit. On April 5, 1933, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 6102 making the private ownership of gold certificates, coins and bullion illegal, reducing the pressure on Federal Reserve gold. Modern non-monetary explanations The monetary explanation has two weaknesses. First, it is not able to explain why the demand for money was falling more rapidly than the supply during the initial downturn in 1930–31. Second, it is not able to explain why in March 1933 a recovery took place although short term interest rates remained close to zero and the money supply was still falling. These questions are addressed by modern explanations that build on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz but add non-monetary explanations. =Debt deflation= Crowds outside the Bank of United States in New York after its failure in 1931 thumb Irving Fisher argued that the predominant factor leading to the Great Depression was a vicious circle of deflation and growing over- indebtedness. He outlined nine factors interacting with one another under conditions of debt and deflation to create the mechanics of boom to bust. The chain of events proceeded as follows: # Debt liquidation and distress selling # Contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off # A fall in the level of asset prices # A still greater fall in the net worth of businesses, precipitating bankruptcies # A fall in profits # A reduction in output, in trade and in employment # Pessimism and loss of confidence # Hoarding of money # A fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation adjusted interest rates During the Crash of 1929 preceding the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%. Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited. When the market fell, brokers called in these loans, which could not be paid back. Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits , triggering multiple bank runs. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets. Outstanding debts became heavier, because prices and incomes fell by 20–50% but the debts remained at the same dollar amount. After the panic of 1929 and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 U.S. banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s.) By April 1933, around $7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the March Bank Holiday.\\"Friedman and Schwartz, Monetary History of the United States\\", 352 Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans that borrowers did not have time or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending. Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated. The liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices that it caused. The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed, relative to the value of declining asset holdings. The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, the more they owed. This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression. Fisher's debt-deflation theory initially lacked mainstream influence because of the counter-argument that debt-deflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group (debtors) to another (creditors). Pure re-distributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects. Building on both the monetary hypothesis of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz and the debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, Ben Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher's argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens, which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently lowers aggregate demand; a further price level decline would then result in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe, falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions, which in turn leads to a credit crunch that seriously harms the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption, which results in declining aggregate demand and additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.Randall E. Parker, Reflections on the Great Depression, Edward Elgar Publishing, 2003, , pp. 14–15 =Expectations hypothesis= Since economic mainstream turned to the new neoclassical synthesis, expectations are a central element of macroeconomic models. According to Peter Temin, Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and Christina Romer, the key to recovery and to ending the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive in March 1933 when Franklin D. Roosevelt took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, and investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround. Money supply was still falling and short-term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933, people expected further deflation and a recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes, people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With these positive expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investment. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crisis and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80% of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free fall in 1933, and output would have been 30% lower in 1937 than in 1933.Gauti B. Eggertsson, Great Expectations and the End of the Depression, American Economic Review 2008, 98:4, 1476–1516Christina Romer, \\"The Fiscal Stimulus, Flawed but Valuable\\", The New York Times, October 20, 2012.Peter Temin, Lessons from the Great Depression, MIT Press, 1992, , pp. 87–101. The recession of 1937–38, which slowed down economic recovery from the Great Depression, is explained by fears of the population that the moderate tightening of the monetary and fiscal policy in 1937 were first steps to a restoration of the pre-1933 policy regime. Common position There is common consensus among economists today that the government and the central bank should work to keep the interconnected macroeconomic aggregates of gross domestic product and money supply on a stable growth path. When threatened by expectations of a depression, central banks should expand liquidity in the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to prevent a collapse in money supply and aggregate demand. At the beginning of the Great Depression, most economists believed in Say's law and the equilibrating powers of the market, and failed to understand the severity of the Depression. Outright leave-it-alone liquidationism was a common position, and was universally held by Austrian School economists. The liquidationist position held that a depression worked to liquidate failed businesses and investments that had been made obsolete by technological development – releasing factors of production (capital and labor) to be redeployed in other more productive sectors of the dynamic economy. They argued that even if self-adjustment of the economy caused mass bankruptcies, it was still the best course. Economists like Barry Eichengreen and J. Bradford DeLong note that President Herbert Hoover tried to keep the federal budget balanced until 1932, when he lost confidence in his Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon and replaced him.Randall E. Parker, Reflections on the Great Depression, Elgar Publishing, 2003, , p. 9 An increasingly common view among economic historians is that the adherence of many Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist position led to disastrous consequences. Unlike what liquidationists expected, a large proportion of the capital stock was not redeployed but vanished during the first years of the Great Depression. According to a study by Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers, the recession caused a drop of net capital accumulation to pre-1924 levels by 1933. Milton Friedman called leave-it-alone liquidationism \\"dangerous nonsense\\". He wrote: ===Heterodox theories=== Austrian School Two prominent theorists in the Austrian School on the Great Depression include Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek and American economist Murray Rothbard, who wrote America's Great Depression (1963). In their view, much like the monetarists, the Federal Reserve (created in 1913) shoulders much of the blame; however unlike the Monetarists, they argue that the key cause of the Depression was the expansion of the money supply in the 1920s, of which led to an unsustainable credit-driven boom.Murray Rothbard, America's Great Depression (Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2000), pp. 159–63. In the Austrian view, it was this inflation of the money supply that led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices (stocks and bonds) and capital goods. Therefore, by the time the Federal Reserve tightened in 1928 it was far too late to prevent an economic contraction. In February 1929 Hayek published a paper predicting the Federal Reserve's actions would lead to a crisis starting in the stock and credit markets.Steele, G. R. (2001). Keynes and Hayek. Routledge. p. 9. . According to Rothbard, the government support for failed enterprises and efforts to keep wages above their market values actually prolonged the Depression.Rothbard, America's Great Depression, pp. 19–21. Unlike Rothbard, after 1970 Hayek believed that the Federal Reserve had further contributed to the problems of the Depression by permitting the money supply to shrink during the earliest years of the Depression. For Hayek's view, see: * Diego Pizano, Conversations with Great Economists: Friedrich A. Hayek, John Hicks, Nicholas Kaldor, Leonid V. Kantorovich, Joan Robinson, Paul A.Samuelson, Jan Tinbergen (Jorge Pinto Books, 2009). For Rothbard's view, see: * Murray Rothbard, A History of Money and Banking in the United States (Ludwig von Mises Institute), pp. 293–94. However, during the Depression (in 1932 and in 1934) Hayek had criticized both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England for not taking a more contractionary stance.John Cunningham Wood, Robert D. Wood, Friedrich A. Hayek, Taylor & Francis, 2004, , p. 115 Hans Sennholz argued that most boom and busts that plagued the American economy, such as those in 1819–20, 1839–43, 1857–60, 1873–78, 1893–97, and 1920–21, were generated by government creating a boom through easy money and credit, which was soon followed by the inevitable bust. The spectacular crash of 1929 followed five years of reckless credit expansion by the Federal Reserve System under the Coolidge Administration. The passing of the Sixteenth Amendment, the passage of The Federal Reserve Act, rising government deficits, the passage of the Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act, and the Revenue Act of 1932, exacerbated and prolonged the crisis. Ludwig von Mises wrote in the 1930s: \\"Credit expansion cannot increase the supply of real goods. It merely brings about a rearrangement. It diverts capital investment away from the course prescribed by the state of economic wealth and market conditions. It causes production to pursue paths which it would not follow unless the economy were to acquire an increase in material goods. As a result, the upswing lacks a solid base. It is not real prosperity. It is illusory prosperity. It did not develop from an increase in economic wealth, i.e. the accumulation of savings made available for productive investment. Rather, it arose because the credit expansion created the illusion of such an increase. Sooner or later, it must become apparent that this economic situation is built on sand.\\" Inequality Power farming displaces tenants from the land in the western dry cotton area. Childress County, Texas, 1938 Two economists of the 1920s, Waddill Catchings and William Trufant Foster, popularized a theory that influenced many policy makers, including Herbert Hoover, Henry A. Wallace, Paul Douglas, and Marriner Eccles. It held the economy produced more than it consumed, because the consumers did not have enough income. Thus the unequal distribution of wealth throughout the 1920s caused the Great Depression.Dorfman 1959 According to this view, the root cause of the Great Depression was a global over-investment in heavy industry capacity compared to wages and earnings from independent businesses, such as farms. The proposed solution was for the government to pump money into the consumers' pockets. That is, it must redistribute purchasing power, maintaining the industrial base, and re-inflating prices and wages to force as much of the inflationary increase in purchasing power into consumer spending. The economy was overbuilt, and new factories were not needed. Foster and Catchings recommendedThe Road to Plenty (1928) federal and state governments to start large construction projects, a program followed by Hoover and Roosevelt. Productivity shock The first three decades of the 20th century saw economic output surge with electrification, mass production, and motorized farm machinery, and because of the rapid growth in productivity there was a lot of excess production capacity and the work week was being reduced. The dramatic rise in productivity of major industries in the U.S. and the effects of productivity on output, wages and the workweek are discussed by Spurgeon Bell in his book Productivity, Wages, and National Income (1940). ==The gold standard and the spreading of global depression== The gold standard was the primary transmission mechanism of the Great Depression. Even countries that did not face bank failures and a monetary contraction first hand were forced to join the deflationary policy since higher interest rates in countries that performed a deflationary policy led to a gold outflow in countries with lower interest rates. Under the gold standard's price–specie flow mechanism, countries that lost gold but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline (deflation).Peter Temin, Gianni Toniolo, The World Economy between the Wars, Oxford University Press, 2008, , p. 106Randall E. Parker, Reflections on the Great Depression, Elgar publishing, 2003, , p. 22. There is also consensus that protectionist policies such as the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act helped to worsen the depression. ===Gold standard=== The Depression in international perspectiveInternational data from . Gold dates culled from historical sources, principally Some economic studies have indicated that just as the downturn was spread worldwide by the rigidities of the gold standard, it was suspending gold convertibility (or devaluing the currency in gold terms) that did the most to make recovery possible. Every major currency left the gold standard during the Great Depression. The UK was the first to do so. Facing speculative attacks on the pound and depleting gold reserves, in September 1931 the Bank of England ceased exchanging pound notes for gold and the pound was floated on foreign exchange markets. Japan and the Scandinavian countries joined the UK in leaving the gold standard in 1931. Other countries, such as Italy and the US, remained on the gold standard into 1932 or 1933, while a few countries in the so-called \\"gold bloc\\", led by France and including Poland, Belgium and Switzerland, stayed on the standard until 1935–36. According to later analysis, the earliness with which a country left the gold standard reliably predicted its economic recovery. For example, The UK and Scandinavia, which left the gold standard in 1931, recovered much earlier than France and Belgium, which remained on gold much longer. Countries such as China, which had a silver standard, almost avoided the depression entirely. The connection between leaving the gold standard as a strong predictor of that country's severity of its depression and the length of time of its recovery has been shown to be consistent for dozens of countries, including developing countries. This partly explains why the experience and length of the depression differed between regions and states across the world. ===Breakdown of international trade=== Many economists have argued that the sharp decline in international trade after 1930 helped to worsen the depression, especially for countries significantly dependent on foreign trade. In a 1995 survey of American economic historians, two-thirds agreed that the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act (enacted June 17, 1930) at least worsened the Great Depression. Most historians and economists blame this Act for worsening the depression by seriously reducing international trade and causing retaliatory tariffs in other countries. While foreign trade was a small part of overall economic activity in the U.S. and was concentrated in a few businesses like farming, it was a much larger factor in many other countries. The average ad valorem rate of duties on dutiable imports for 1921–25 was 25.9% but under the new tariff it jumped to 50% during 1931–35. In dollar terms, American exports declined over the next four (4) years from about $5.2 billion in 1929 to $1.7 billion in 1933; so, not only did the physical volume of exports fall, but also the prices fell by about 1/3 as written. Hardest hit were farm commodities such as wheat, cotton, tobacco, and lumber. Governments around the world took various steps into spending less money on foreign goods such as: \\"imposing tariffs, import quotas, and exchange controls\\". These restrictions triggered much tension among countries that had large amounts of bilateral trade, causing major export-import reductions during the depression. Not all governments enforced the same measures of protectionism. Some countries raised tariffs drastically and enforced severe restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, while other countries reduced \\"trade and exchange restrictions only marginally\\": * \\"Countries that remained on the gold standard, keeping currencies fixed, were more likely to restrict foreign trade.\\" These countries \\"resorted to protectionist policies to strengthen the balance of payments and limit gold losses.\\" They hoped that these restrictions and depletions would hold the economic decline. * Countries that abandoned the gold standard, allowed their currencies to depreciate which caused their balance of payments to strengthen. It also freed up monetary policy so that central banks could lower interest rates and act as lenders of last resort. They possessed the best policy instruments to fight the Depression and did not need protectionism. * \\"The length and depth of a country's economic downturn and the timing and vigor of its recovery are related to how long it remained on the gold standard. Countries abandoning the gold standard relatively early experienced relatively mild recessions and early recoveries. In contrast, countries remaining on the gold standard experienced prolonged slumps.\\" Effect of tariffs The consensus view among economists and economic historians (including Keynesians, Monetarists and Austrian economists) is that the passage of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff exacerbated the Great Depression, although there is disagreement as to how much. In the popular view, the Smoot- Hawley Tariff was a leading cause of the depression.Protectionism and the Great Depression, Paul Krugman, New York Times, November 30, 2009The protectionist temptation: Lessons from the Great Depression for today, VOX, Barry Eichengreen, Douglas Irwin, March 17, 2009 According to the U.S. Senate website the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act is among the most catastrophic acts in congressional history ===German banking crisis of 1931 and British crisis=== The financial crisis escalated out of control in mid-1931, starting with the collapse of the Credit Anstalt in Vienna in May.Charles Loch Mowat, Britain between the wars, 1918–1940 (1955) pp. 379–85.William Ashworth, A short history of the international economy since 1850 (2nd ed 1962) pp. 237–44. This put heavy pressure on Germany, which was already in political turmoil. With the rise in violence of Nazi and communist movements, as well as investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies.Isabel Schnabel, \\"The German twin crisis of 1931\\". Journal of Economic History 64#3 (2004): 822–871. Investors withdrew their short-term money from Germany, as confidence spiraled downward. The Reichsbank lost 150 million marks in the first week of June, 540 million in the second, and 150 million in two days, June 19–20. Collapse was at hand. U.S. President Herbert Hoover called for a moratorium on Payment of war reparations. This angered Paris, which depended on a steady flow of German payments, but it slowed the crisis down, and the moratorium was agreed to in July 1931. An International conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on August 19 a standstill agreement froze Germany's foreign liabilities for six months. Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England. The funding only slowed the process. Industrial failures began in Germany, a major bank closed in July and a two-day holiday for all German banks was declared. Business failures were more frequent in July, and spread to Romania and Hungary. The crisis continued to get worse in Germany, bringing political upheaval that finally led to the coming to power of Hitler's Nazi regime in January 1933.H.V. Hodson, Slump and Recovery, 1929–1937 (London, 1938), pp. 64–76. The world financial crisis now began to overwhelm Britain; investors across the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of £2.5 million per day. Credits of £25 million each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of £15 million fiduciary note slowed, but did not reverse the British crisis. The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931. With deficits mounting, the bankers demanded a balanced budget; the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government agreed; it proposed to raise taxes, cut spending, and most controversially, to cut unemployment benefits 20%. The attack on welfare was unacceptable to the Labour movement. MacDonald wanted to resign, but King George V insisted he remain and form an all-party coalition \\"National Government\\". The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on, along with a small cadre of Labour, but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government. Britain went off the gold standard, and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression. In the 1931 British election, the Labour Party was virtually destroyed, leaving MacDonald as Prime Minister for a largely Conservative coalition.Mowat, Britain between the wars, 1918–1940 (1955) pp. 386–412.Sean Glynn and John Oxborrow, Interwar Britain : a social and economic history (1976) pp. 67–73. ==Turning point and recovery== The overall course of the Depression in the United States, as reflected in per-capita GDP (average income per person) shown in constant year 2000 dollars, plus some of the key events of the period. Dotted red line = long-term trend 1920–1970.Per-capita GDP data from MeasuringWorth: What Was the U.S. GDP Then? In most countries of the world, recovery from the Great Depression began in 1933. In the U.S., recovery began in early 1933, but the U.S. did not return to 1929 GNP for over a decade and still had an unemployment rate of about 15% in 1940, albeit down from the high of 25% in 1933. There is no consensus among economists regarding the motive force for the U.S. economic expansion that continued through most of the Roosevelt years (and the 1937 recession that interrupted it). The common view among most economists is that Roosevelt's New Deal policies either caused or accelerated the recovery, although his policies were never aggressive enough to bring the economy completely out of recession. Some economists have also called attention to the positive effects from expectations of reflation and rising nominal interest rates that Roosevelt's words and actions portended.Gauti B. Eggertsson, \\"Great Expectations and the End of the Depression,\\" American Economic Review 98, No. 4 (Sep 2008): 1476–1516\\"Was the New Deal Contractionary?\\" Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report 264, Oct 2006, Gauti B. Eggertsson It was the rollback of those same reflationary policies that led to the interruption of a recession beginning in late 1937.\\"The Mistake of 1937: A General Equilibrium Analysis,\\" Monetary and Economic Studies 24, No. S-1 (December 2006), Boj.or.jp One contributing policy that reversed reflation was the Banking Act of 1935, which effectively raised reserve requirements, causing a monetary contraction that helped to thwart the recovery.Steven Horwitz, \\"Unfortunately Unfamiliar with Robert Higgs and Others: A Rejoinder to Gauti Eggertsson on the 1930s,\\" Econ Journal Watch 8(1), 2, January 2011. GDP returned to its upward trend in 1938. According to Christina Romer, the money supply growth caused by huge international gold inflows was a crucial source of the recovery of the United States economy, and that the economy showed little sign of self-correction. The gold inflows were partly due to devaluation of the U.S. dollar and partly due to deterioration of the political situation in Europe. In their book, A Monetary History of the United States, Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz also attributed the recovery to monetary factors, and contended that it was much slowed by poor management of money by the Federal Reserve System. Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke agreed that monetary factors played important roles both in the worldwide economic decline and eventual recovery.Ben Bernanke. Essays on the Great Depression. Princeton University Press. . p. 7 Bernanke also saw a strong role for institutional factors, particularly the rebuilding and restructuring of the financial system,Ben S. Bernanke, \\"Nonmonetary Effects of the Financial Crisis in the Propaga-tion of the Great Depression,\\" The American Economic Review 73, No. 3 (June 1983): 257–76, available from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank collection at Stlouisfed.org and pointed out that the Depression should be examined in an international perspective. ===Role of women and household economics=== Women's primary role was as housewives; without a steady flow of family income, their work became much harder in dealing with food and clothing and medical care. Birthrates fell everywhere, as children were postponed until families could financially support them. The average birthrate for 14 major countries fell 12% from 19.3 births per thousand population in 1930, to 17.0 in 1935.W. S. Woytinsky and E. S. Woytinsky, World population and production: trends and outlook (1953) p. 148 In Canada, half of Roman Catholic women defied Church teachings and used contraception to postpone births.Denyse Baillargeon, Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression (Wilfrid Laurier UP, 1999), p. 159. Among the few women in the labor force, layoffs were less common in the white-collar jobs and they were typically found in light manufacturing work. However, there was a widespread demand to limit families to one paid job, so that wives might lose employment if their husband was employed. Across Britain, there was a tendency for married women to join the labor force, competing for part-time jobs especially.Jessica S. Bean, To help keep the home going': female labour supply in interwar London.\\" Economic History Review (2015) 68#2 pp. 441–70.Deirdre Beddoe, Back to Home and Duty: Women Between the Wars, 1918–1939 (1989). In France, very slow population growth, especially in comparison to Germany continued to be a serious issue in the 1930s. Support for increasing welfare programs during the depression included a focus on women in the family. The Conseil Supérieur de la Natalité campaigned for provisions enacted in the Code de la Famille (1939) that increased state assistance to families with children and required employers to protect the jobs of fathers, even if they were immigrants. In rural and small- town areas, women expanded their operation of vegetable gardens to include as much food production as possible. In the United States, agricultural organizations sponsored programs to teach housewives how to optimize their gardens and to raise poultry for meat and eggs.Ann E. McCleary, I Was Really Proud of Them': Canned Raspberries and Home Production During the Farm Depression\\". Augusta Historical Bulletin (2010), Issue 46, pp. 14–44. Rural women made feed sack dresses and other items for themselves and their families and homes from feed sacks. In American cities, African American women quiltmakers enlarged their activities, promoted collaboration, and trained neophytes. Quilts were created for practical use from various inexpensive materials and increased social interaction for women and promoted camaraderie and personal fulfillment. Oral history provides evidence for how housewives in a modern industrial city handled shortages of money and resources. Often they updated strategies their mothers used when they were growing up in poor families. Cheap foods were used, such as soups, beans and noodles. They purchased the cheapest cuts of meat—sometimes even horse meat—and recycled the Sunday roast into sandwiches and soups. They sewed and patched clothing, traded with their neighbors for outgrown items, and made do with colder homes. New furniture and appliances were postponed until better days. Many women also worked outside the home, or took boarders, did laundry for trade or cash, and did sewing for neighbors in exchange for something they could offer. Extended families used mutual aid—extra food, spare rooms, repair-work, cash loans—to help cousins and in-laws.Baillargeon, Making Do: Women, Family and Home in Montreal during the Great Depression (1999), pp. 70, 108, 136–38, 159. In Japan, official government policy was deflationary and the opposite of Keynesian spending. Consequently, the government launched a campaign across the country to induce households to reduce their consumption, focusing attention on spending by housewives. In Germany, the government tried to reshape private household consumption under the Four-Year Plan of 1936 to achieve German economic self-sufficiency. The Nazi women's organizations, other propaganda agencies and the authorities all attempted to shape such consumption as economic self-sufficiency was needed to prepare for and to sustain the coming war. The organizations, propaganda agencies and authorities employed slogans that called up traditional values of thrift and healthy living. However, these efforts were only partly successful in changing the behavior of housewives. ===World War II and recovery=== A female factory worker in 1942, Fort Worth, Texas. Women entered the workforce as men were drafted into the armed forces. The common view among economic historians is that the Great Depression ended with the advent of World War II. Many economists believe that government spending on the war caused or at least accelerated recovery from the Great Depression, though some consider that it did not play a very large role in the recovery, though it did help in reducing unemployment.Referring to the effect of World War II spending on the economy, economist John Kenneth Galbraith said, \\"One could not have had a better demonstration of the Keynesian ideas.\\" The rearmament policies leading up to World War II helped stimulate the economies of Europe in 1937–39. By 1937, unemployment in Britain had fallen to 1.5 million. The mobilization of manpower following the outbreak of war in 1939 ended unemployment.Great Depression and World War II. The Library of Congress. When the United States entered the war in 1941, it finally eliminated the last effects from the Great Depression and brought the U.S. unemployment rate down below 10%.Depression & WWII . Americaslibrary.gov. In the US, massive war spending doubled economic growth rates, either masking the effects of the Depression or essentially ending the Depression. Businessmen ignored the mounting national debt and heavy new taxes, redoubling their efforts for greater output to take advantage of generous government contracts.Richard J. Jensen, \\"The causes and cures of unemployment in the Great Depression.\\" Journal of Interdisciplinary History 19.4 (1989): 553-583. online ==Socio-economic effects== An impoverished American family living in a shanty, 1936 The majority of countries set up relief programs and most underwent some sort of political upheaval, pushing them to the right. Many of the countries in Europe and Latin America that were democracies saw them overthrown by some form of dictatorship or authoritarian rule, most famously in Germany in 1933. The Dominion of Newfoundland gave up democracy voluntarily. ===Australia=== Australia's dependence on agricultural and industrial exports meant it was one of the hardest-hit developed countries.Geoffrey Lawrence, Capitalism and the Countryside: The rural crisis in Australia (Pluto Press, 1987) Falling export demand and commodity prices placed massive downward pressures on wages. Unemployment reached a record high of 29% in 1932,A Century of Change in the Australian Labour Market, Australian Bureau of Statistics with incidents of civil unrest becoming common.John Birmingham (2000). Leviathan: The unauthorised biography of Sydney. Random House. After 1932, an increase in wool and meat prices led to a gradual recovery.Judy Mackinolty, ed. The Wasted Years?: Australia's Great Depression (Allen & Unwin, 1981). ===Canada=== Unemployed men march in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Harshly affected by both the global economic downturn and the Dust Bowl, Canadian industrial production had by 1932 fallen to only 58% of its 1929 figure, the second-lowest level in the world after the United States, and well behind countries such as Britain, which fell to only 83% of the 1929 level. Total national income fell to 56% of the 1929 level, again worse than any country apart from the United States. Unemployment reached 27% at the depth of the Depression in 1933.1929–1939 – The Great Depression , Source: Bank of Canada ===Chile=== The League of Nations labeled Chile the country hardest hit by the Great Depression because 80% of government revenue came from exports of copper and nitrates, which were in low demand. Chile initially felt the impact of the Great Depression in 1930, when GDP dropped 14%, mining income declined 27%, and export earnings fell 28%. By 1932, GDP had shrunk to less than half of what it had been in 1929, exacting a terrible toll in unemployment and business failures. Influenced profoundly by the Great Depression, many government leaders promoted the development of local industry in an effort to insulate the economy from future external shocks. After six years of government austerity measures, which succeeded in reestablishing Chile's creditworthiness, Chileans elected to office during the 1938–58 period a succession of center and left-of-center governments interested in promoting economic growth through government intervention. Prompted in part by the devastating 1939 Chillán earthquake, the Popular Front government of Pedro Aguirre Cerda created the Production Development Corporation (Corporación de Fomento de la Producción, CORFO) to encourage with subsidies and direct investments an ambitious program of import substitution industrialization. Consequently, as in other Latin American countries, protectionism became an entrenched aspect of the Chilean economy. ===China=== China was largely unaffected by the Depression, mainly by having stuck to the Silver standard. However, the U.S. silver purchase act of 1934 created an intolerable demand on China's silver coins, and so, in the end, the silver standard was officially abandoned in 1935 in favor of the four Chinese national banks' \\"legal note\\" issues. China and the British colony of Hong Kong, which followed suit in this regard in September 1935, would be the last to abandon the silver standard. In addition, the Nationalist Government also acted energetically to modernize the legal and penal systems, stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in narcotics and augment industrial and agricultural production. On November 3, 1935, the government instituted the fiat currency (fapi) reform, immediately stabilizing prices and also raising revenues for the government. ===European African colonies=== The sharp fall in commodity prices, and the steep decline in exports, hurt the economies of the European colonies in Africa and Asia.Anthony Latham and John Heaton, The Depression and the Developing World, 1914–1939 (1981). The agricultural sector was especially hard hit. For example, sisal had recently become a major export crop in Kenya and Tanganyika. During the depression, it suffered severely from low prices and marketing problems that affected all colonial commodities in Africa. Sisal producers established centralized controls for the export of their fibre. There was widespread unemployment and hardship among peasants, labourers, colonial auxiliaries, and artisans.R. Olufeni Ekundare, An Economic History of Nigeria 1860–1960 (1973) online pp. 104–226. The budgets of colonial governments were cut, which forced the reduction in ongoing infrastructure projects, such as the building and upgrading of roads, ports and communications. The budget cuts delayed the schedule for creating systems of higher education. The depression severely hurt the export-based Belgian Congo economy because of the drop in international demand for raw materials and for agricultural products. For example, the price of peanuts fell from 125 to 25 centimes. In some areas, as in the Katanga mining region, employment declined by 70%. In the country as a whole, the wage labour force decreased by 72.000 and many men returned to their villages. In Leopoldville, the population decreased by 33%, because of this labour migration.R. Anstey, King Leopold's Legacy: The Congo under Belgian Rule 1908–1960 (1966), p. 109. Political protests were not common. However, there was a growing demand that the paternalistic claims be honored by colonial governments to respond vigorously. The theme was that economic reforms were more urgently needed than political reforms. French West Africa launched an extensive program of educational reform centered around \\"rural schools\\" designed to modernize agriculture and stem the flow of under-employed farm workers to cites where unemployment was high. Students were trained in traditional arts, crafts, and farming techniques and were then expected to return to their own villages and towns. ===France=== The crisis affected France a bit later than other countries, hitting hard around 1931. While the 1920s grew at the very strong rate of 4.43% per year, the 1930s rate fell to only 0.63%.Jean-Pierre Dormois, The French Economy in the Twentieth Century (2004) p. 31 The depression was relatively mild: unemployment peaked under 5%, the fall in production was at most 20% below the 1929 output; there was no banking crisis. However, the depression had drastic effects on the local economy, and partly explains the February 6, 1934 riots and even more the formation of the Popular Front, led by SFIO socialist leader Léon Blum, which won the elections in 1936. Ultra- nationalist groups also saw increased popularity, although democracy prevailed into World War II. France's relatively high degree of self-sufficiency meant the damage was considerably less than in neighbouring states like Germany. ===Germany=== Adolf Hitler speaking in 1935 The Great Depression hit Germany hard. The impact of the Wall Street Crash forced American banks to end the new loans that had been funding the repayments under the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan. The financial crisis escalated out of control in mid-1931, starting with the collapse of the Credit Anstalt in Vienna in May. This put heavy pressure on Germany, which was already in political turmoil with the rise in violence of Nazi and communist movements, as well as with investor nervousness at harsh government financial policies. Investors withdrew their short-term money from Germany, as confidence spiraled downward. The Reichsbank lost 150 million marks in the first week of June, 540 million in the second, and 150 million in two days, June 19–20. Collapse was at hand. U.S. President Herbert Hoover called for a moratorium on Payment of war reparations. This angered Paris, which depended on a steady flow of German payments, but it slowed the crisis down, and the moratorium was agreed to in July 1931. An international conference in London later in July produced no agreements but on August 19 a standstill agreement froze Germany's foreign liabilities for six months. Germany received emergency funding from private banks in New York as well as the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England. The funding only slowed the process. Industrial failures began in Germany, a major bank closed in July and a two-day holiday for all German banks was declared. Business failures became more frequent in July, and spread to Romania and Hungary. In 1932, 90% of German reparation payments were cancelled (in the 1950s, Germany repaid all its missed reparations debts). Widespread unemployment reached 25% as every sector was hurt. The government did not increase government spending to deal with Germany's growing crisis, as they were afraid that a high-spending policy could lead to a return of the hyperinflation that had affected Germany in 1923. Germany's Weimar Republic was hit hard by the depression, as American loans to help rebuild the German economy now stopped.About the Great Depression, University of Illinois The unemployment rate reached nearly 30% in 1932, bolstering support for the Nazi (NSDAP) and Communist (KPD) parties, causing the collapse of the politically centrist Social Democratic Party. Hitler ran for the Presidency in 1932, and while he lost to the incumbent Hindenburg in the election, it marked a point during which both Nazi Party and the Communist parties rose in the years following the crash to altogether possess a Reichstag majority following the general election in July 1932.Germany – Economic, Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). Hitler followed an autarky economic policy, creating a network of client states and economic allies in central Europe and Latin America. By cutting wages and taking control of labor unions, plus public works spending, unemployment fell significantly by 1935. Large-scale military spending played a major role in the recovery.Adam Tooze, The Wages of Destruction: The Making and Breaking of the Nazi Economy (2007) ===Greece=== The reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932. The Bank of Greece tried to adopt deflationary policies to stave off the crises that were going on in other countries, but these largely failed. For a brief period, the drachma was pegged to the U.S. dollar, but this was unsustainable given the country's large trade deficit and the only long-term effects of this were Greece's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932. Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April 1931. This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK, France, and the Middle East for many necessities. Greece went off the gold standard in April 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments. The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas, which several European countries did during the period. Protectionist policies coupled with a weak drachma, stifling imports, allowed the Greek industry to expand during the Great Depression. In 1939, the Greek industrial output was 179% that of 1928. These industries were for the most part \\"built on sand\\" as one report of the Bank of Greece put it, as without massive protection they would not have been able to survive. Despite the global depression, Greece managed to suffer comparatively little, averaging an average growth rate of 3.5% from 1932 to 1939. The dictatorial regime of Ioannis Metaxas took over the Greek government in 1936, and economic growth was strong in the years leading up to the Second World War. ===Iceland=== Icelandic post-World War I prosperity came to an end with the outbreak of the Great Depression. The Depression hit Iceland hard as the value of exports plummeted. The total value of Icelandic exports fell from 74 million kronur in 1929 to 48 million in 1932, and was not to rise again to the pre-1930 level until after 1939. Government interference in the economy increased: \\"Imports were regulated, trade with foreign currency was monopolized by state-owned banks, and loan capital was largely distributed by state-regulated funds\\". Due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, which cut Iceland's exports of saltfish by half, the Depression lasted in Iceland until the outbreak of World War II (when prices for fish exports soared). ===India=== How much India was affected has been hotly debated. Historians have argued that the Great Depression slowed long-term industrial development. Apart from two sectors—jute and coal—the economy was little affected. However, there were major negative impacts on the jute industry, as world demand fell and prices plunged.Samita Sen, \\"Labour, Organization and Gender: The Jute Industry in India in the 1930s,\\" in Helmut Konrad and Wolfgang Maderthaner, eds. Routes Into the Abyss: Coping with Crises in the 1930s (2013) pp. 152–66. Otherwise, conditions were fairly stable. Local markets in agriculture and small-scale industry showed modest gains. ===Ireland=== Frank Barry and Mary E. Daly have argued that: :Ireland was a largely agrarian economy, trading almost exclusively with the UK, at the time of the Great Depression. Beef and dairy products comprised the bulk of exports, and Ireland fared well relative to many other commodity producers, particularly in the early years of the depression.Frank Barry and Mary F. Daly, \\"Concurrent Irish Perspectives on the Great Depression\\" (2010) [ online ]Frank Barry and Mary E. Daly, \\"Irish Perceptions of the Great Depression\\" in Michael Psalidopoulos, The Great Depression in Europe: Economic Thought and Policy in a National Context (Athens: Alpha Bank, 2012) pp. 395–424.See also B. Girvin, Between Two Worlds: Politics and Economy in Independent Ireland (Dublin: Gill and Macmillan, 1989).Barry, Frank, and Mary E. Daly. \\"Irish Perceptions of the Great Depression\\" (No. iiisdp349. IIIS, 2011.) Online ===Italy=== Benito Mussolini giving a speech at the Fiat Lingotto factory in Turin, 1932 The Great Depression hit Italy very hard.Vera Zamagni, The economic history of Italy 1860–1990 (Oxford University Press, 1993) As industries came close to failure they were bought out by the banks in a largely illusionary bail-out—the assets used to fund the purchases were largely worthless. This led to a financial crisis peaking in 1932 and major government intervention. The Industrial Reconstruction Institute (IRI) was formed in January 1933 and took control of the bank-owned companies, suddenly giving Italy the largest state-owned industrial sector in Europe (excluding the USSR). IRI did rather well with its new responsibilities—restructuring, modernising and rationalising as much as it could. It was a significant factor in post-1945 development. But it took the Italian economy until 1935 to recover the manufacturing levels of 1930—a position that was only 60% better than that of 1913.Fabrizio Mattesini, and Beniamino Quintieri. \\"Italy and the Great Depression: An analysis of the Italian economy, 1929–1936.\\" Explorations in Economic History (1997) 34#3 pp: 265–294.Fabrizio Mattesini and Beniamino Quintieri. \\"Does a reduction in the length of the working week reduce unemployment? Some evidence from the Italian economy during the Great Depression.\\" Explorations in Economic History (2006), 43#3, pp. 413–37. ===Japan=== The Great Depression did not strongly affect Japan. The Japanese economy shrank by 8% during 1929–31. Japan's Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo was the first to implement what have come to be identified as Keynesian economic policies: first, by large fiscal stimulus involving deficit spending; and second, by devaluing the currency. Takahashi used the Bank of Japan to sterilize the deficit spending and minimize resulting inflationary pressures. Econometric studies have identified the fiscal stimulus as especially effective.Myung Soo Cha, \\"Did Takahashi Korekiyo Rescue Japan from the Great Depression?\\", The Journal of Economic History 63, No. 1 (March 2003): 127–144. The devaluation of the currency had an immediate effect. Japanese textiles began to displace British textiles in export markets. The deficit spending proved to be most profound and went into the purchase of munitions for the armed forces. By 1933, Japan was already out of the depression. By 1934, Takahashi realized that the economy was in danger of overheating, and to avoid inflation, moved to reduce the deficit spending that went towards armaments and munitions. This resulted in a strong and swift negative reaction from nationalists, especially those in the army, culminating in his assassination in the course of the February 26 Incident. This had a chilling effect on all civilian bureaucrats in the Japanese government. From 1934, the military's dominance of the government continued to grow. Instead of reducing deficit spending, the government introduced price controls and rationing schemes that reduced, but did not eliminate inflation, which remained a problem until the end of World War II. The deficit spending had a transformative effect on Japan. Japan's industrial production doubled during the 1930s. Further, in 1929 the list of the largest firms in Japan was dominated by light industries, especially textile companies (many of Japan's automakers, such as Toyota, have their roots in the textile industry). By 1940 light industry had been displaced by heavy industry as the largest firms inside the Japanese economy.(For more on the Japanese economy in the 1930s see \\"MITI and the Japanese Miracle\\" by Chalmers Johnson.) ===Latin America=== Because of high levels of U.S. investment in Latin American economies, they were severely damaged by the Depression. Within the region, Chile, Bolivia and Peru were particularly badly affected.Rosemary Thorp, Latin America in the 1930s: the role of the periphery in world crisis (Palgrave Macmillan, 2000). Before the 1929 crisis, links between the world economy and Latin American economies had been established through American and British investment in Latin American exports to the world. As a result, Latin Americans export industries felt the depression quickly. World prices for commodities such as wheat, coffee and copper plunged. Exports from all of Latin America to the U.S. fell in value from $1.2 billion in 1929 to $335 million in 1933, rising to $660 million in 1940. But on the other hand, the depression led the area governments to develop new local industries and expand consumption and production. Following the example of the New Deal, governments in the area approved regulations and created or improved welfare institutions that helped millions of new industrial workers to achieve a better standard of living. ===Netherlands=== From roughly 1931 to 1937, the Netherlands suffered a deep and exceptionally long depression. This depression was partly caused by the after-effects of the Stock Market Crash of 1929 in the US, and partly by internal factors in the Netherlands. Government policy, especially the very late dropping of the Gold Standard, played a role in prolonging the depression. The Great Depression in the Netherlands led to some political instability and riots, and can be linked to the rise of the Dutch fascist political party NSB. The depression in the Netherlands eased off somewhat at the end of 1936, when the government finally dropped the Gold Standard, but real economic stability did not return until after World War II.E.H. Kossmann, The Low Countries: 1780–1940 (1978). ===New Zealand=== New Zealand was especially vulnerable to worldwide depression, as it relied almost entirely on agricultural exports to the United Kingdom for its economy. The drop in exports led to a lack of disposable income from the farmers, who were the mainstay of the local economy. Jobs disappeared and wages plummeted, leaving people desperate and charities unable to cope. Work relief schemes were the only government support available to the unemployed, the rate of which by the early 1930s was officially around 15%, but unofficially nearly twice that level (official figures excluded Māori and women). In 1932, riots occurred among the unemployed in three of the country's main cities (Auckland, Dunedin, and Wellington). Many were arrested or injured through the tough official handling of these riots by police and volunteer \\"special constables\\".\\"Social Welfare and The State: Great Depression\\", Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. ===Portugal=== Already under the rule of a dictatorial junta, the Ditadura Nacional, Portugal suffered no turbulent political effects of the Depression, although António de Oliveira Salazar, already appointed Minister of Finance in 1928 greatly expanded his powers and in 1932 rose to Prime Minister of Portugal to found the Estado Novo, an authoritarian corporatist dictatorship. With the budget balanced in 1929, the effects of the depression were relaxed through harsh measures towards budget balance and autarky, causing social discontent but stability and, eventually, an impressive economic growth.José Cardozo, \\"The great depression and Portugal\\" in Michael Psalidopoulos, ed. (2012). The Great Depression in Europe: Economic Thought and Policy in a National Context Athens: Alpha Bank, . pp. 361–94 Online ===Puerto Rico=== In the years immediately preceding the depression, negative developments in the island and world economies perpetuated an unsustainable cycle of subsistence for many Puerto Rican workers. The 1920s brought a dramatic drop in Puerto Rico's two primary exports, raw sugar and coffee, due to a devastating hurricane in 1928 and the plummeting demand from global markets in the latter half of the decade. 1930 unemployment on the island was roughly 36% and by 1933 Puerto Rico's per capita income dropped 30% (by comparison, unemployment in the United States in 1930 was approximately 8% reaching a height of 25% in 1933). To provide relief and economic reform, the United States government and Puerto Rican politicians such as Carlos Chardon and Luis Muñoz Marín created and administered first the Puerto Rico Emergency Relief Administration (PRERA) 1933 and then in 1935, the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (PRRA). ===South Africa=== As world trade slumped, demand for South African agricultural and mineral exports fell drastically. The Carnegie Commission on Poor Whites had concluded in 1931 that nearly one-third of Afrikaners lived as paupers. The social discomfort caused by the depression was a contributing factor in the 1933 split between the \\"gesuiwerde\\" (purified) and \\"smelter\\" (fusionist) factions within the National Party and the National Party's subsequent fusion with the South African Party.Dan O'Meara, Volkskapitalisme: class, capital, and ideology in the development of Afrikaner nationalism, 1934–1948 (Cambridge University Press, 1983).The Great Depression and the 1930S, Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress. Unemployment programs were begun that focused primarily on the white population. ===Soviet Union=== The Soviet Union was the world's only socialist state with very little international trade. Its economy was not tied to the rest of the world and was only slightly affected by the Great Depression.Robert William Davies, Mark Harrison, and Stephen G. Wheatcroft, eds. The economic transformation of the Soviet Union, 1913–1945 (Cambridge University Press, 1994) Its forced transformation from a rural to an industrial society succeeded in building up heavy industry, at the cost of millions of lives in rural Russia and Ukraine.Robert Conquest, The Harvest of Sorrow: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine (1987). At the time of the Depression, the Soviet economy was growing steadily, fuelled by intensive investment in heavy industry. The apparent economic success of the Soviet Union at a time when the capitalist world was in crisis led many Western intellectuals to view the Soviet system favorably. Jennifer Burns wrote: Despite all of this, The Great Depression caused mass immigration to the Soviet Union, mostly from Finland and Germany. Soviet Russia was at first happy to help these immigrants settle, because they believed they were victims of capitalism who had come to help the Soviet cause. However, when the Soviet Union entered the war in 1941, most of these Germans and Finns were arrested and sent to Siberia, while their Russian-born children were placed in orphanages. Their fate remains unknown. ===Spain=== Spain had a relatively isolated economy, with high protective tariffs and was not one of the main countries affected by the Depression. The banking system held up well, as did agriculture.Gabriel Tortella and Jordi Palafox, \\"Banking and Industry in Spain 1918–1936,\\" Journal of European Economic History (1984), 13#2 Special Issue, pp. 81–110. By far the most serious negative impact came after 1936 from the heavy destruction of infrastructure and manpower by the civil war, 1936–39. Many talented workers were forced into permanent exile. By staying neutral in the Second World War, and selling to both sides, the economy avoided further disasters.R.J. Harrison, Economic History of Modern Spain (1978), pp. 129–49. ===Sweden=== By the 1930s, Sweden had what America's Life magazine called in 1938 the \\"world's highest standard of living\\". Sweden was also the first country worldwide to recover completely from the Great Depression. Taking place amid a short-lived government and a less-than-a-decade old Swedish democracy, events such as those surrounding Ivar Kreuger (who eventually committed suicide) remain infamous in Swedish history. The Social Democrats under Per Albin Hansson formed their first long-lived government in 1932 based on strong interventionist and welfare state policies, monopolizing the office of Prime Minister until 1976 with the sole and short-lived exception of Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp's \\"summer cabinet\\" in 1936. During forty years of hegemony, it was the most successful political party in the history of Western liberal democracy.Göran Therborn, \\"A Unique Chapter in the History of Democracy: The Swedish Social Democrats\\", in K. Misgeld et al. (eds), Creating Social Democracy, University Park, Penn State University Press, 1996. ===Thailand=== In Thailand, then known as the Kingdom of Siam, the Great Depression contributed to the end of the absolute monarchy of King Rama VII in the Siamese revolution of 1932. ===United Kingdom=== Unemployed people in front of a workhouse in London, 1930 The World Depression broke at a time when the United Kingdom had still not fully recovered from the effects of the First World War more than a decade earlier. The country was driven off the gold standard in 1931. The world financial crisis began to overwhelm Britain in 1931; investors across the world started withdrawing their gold from London at the rate of £2.5 million per day. Credits of £25 million each from the Bank of France and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an issue of £15 million fiduciary note slowed, but did not reverse the British crisis. The financial crisis now caused a major political crisis in Britain in August 1931. With deficits mounting, the bankers demanded a balanced budget; the divided cabinet of Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government agreed; it proposed to raise taxes, cut spending and most controversially, to cut unemployment benefits by 20%. The attack on welfare was totally unacceptable to the Labour movement. MacDonald wanted to resign, but King George V insisted he remain and form an all-party coalition \\"National Government\\". The Conservative and Liberals parties signed on, along with a small cadre of Labour, but the vast majority of Labour leaders denounced MacDonald as a traitor for leading the new government. Britain went off the gold standard, and suffered relatively less than other major countries in the Great Depression. In the 1931 British election, the Labour Party was virtually destroyed, leaving MacDonald as Prime Minister for a largely Conservative coalition.Charles Loch Mowat, Britain between the wars, 1918–1940 (1955) pp. 386–412. The effects on the northern industrial areas of Britain were immediate and devastating, as demand for traditional industrial products collapsed. By the end of 1930 unemployment had more than doubled from 1 million to 2.5 million (20% of the insured workforce), and exports had fallen in value by 50%. In 1933, 30% of Glaswegians were unemployed due to the severe decline in heavy industry. In some towns and cities in the north east, unemployment reached as high as 70% as shipbuilding fell by 90%.Unemployment During The Great Depression , thegreatdepression.co.uk The National Hunger March of September–October 1932 was the largestCook, Chris and Bewes, Diccon; What Happened Where: A Guide To Places And Events In Twentieth-Century History p. 115; Routledge, 1997 of a series of hunger marches in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s. About 200,000 unemployed men were sent to the work camps, which continued in operation until 1939.\\"Work camps that tackled Depression\\", BBC News. In the less industrial Midlands and Southern England, the effects were short-lived and the later 1930s were a prosperous time. Growth in modern manufacture of electrical goods and a boom in the motor car industry was helped by a growing southern population and an expanding middle class. Agriculture also saw a boom during this period.Constantine, Stephen (1983), Social Conditions in Britain 1918–1939, ===United States=== Unemployed men standing in line outside a depression soup kitchen in Chicago 1931. Hoover's first measures to combat the depression were based on voluntarism by businesses not to reduce their workforce or cut wages. But businesses had little choice and wages were reduced, workers were laid off, and investments postponed.Peter Clemens, Prosperity, Depression and the New Deal: The USA 1890–1954, Hodder Education, 4. Auflage, 2008, , p. 114.Charles R. Morris, A Rabble of Dead Money: The Great Crash and the Global Depression: 1929–1939 (PublicAffairs, 2017), 389 pp. online review In June 1930, Congress approved the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act which raised tariffs on thousands of imported items. The intent of the Act was to encourage the purchase of American-made products by increasing the cost of imported goods, while raising revenue for the federal government and protecting farmers. Most countries that traded with the US increased tariffs on American-made goods in retaliation, reducing international trade, and worsening the Depression.\\"Smoot-Hawley Tariff\\" , U.S. Department of State. In 1931, Hoover urged bankers to set up the National Credit Corporation so that big banks could help failing banks survive. But bankers were reluctant to invest in failing banks, and the National Credit Corporation did almost nothing to address the problem.Clemens, Prosperity, Depression and the New Deal, 2008, p. 113.

By 1932, unemployment had reached 23.6%, peaking in early 1933 at 25%. Drought persisted in the agricultural heartland, businesses and families defaulted on record numbers of loans, and more than 5,000 banks had failed.\\"Great Depression in the United States\\", Microsoft Encarta. Archived October 31, 2009. Hundreds of thousands of Americans found themselves homeless, and began congregating in shanty towns – dubbed \\"Hoovervilles\\" – that began to appear across the country.Joyce Bryant, \\"The Great Depression and New Deal\\", Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. In response, President Hoover and Congress approved the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, to spur new home construction, and reduce foreclosures. The final attempt of the Hoover Administration to stimulate the economy was the passage of the Emergency Relief and Construction Act (ERA) which included funds for public works programs such as dams and the creation of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) in 1932. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2 billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions. But $2 billion was not enough to save all the banks, and bank runs and bank failures continued. Quarter by quarter the economy went downhill, as prices, profits and employment fell, leading to the political realignment in 1932 that brought to power Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It is important to note, however, that after volunteerism failed, Hoover developed ideas that laid the framework for parts of the New Deal. Buried machinery in a barn lot; South Dakota, May 1936. The Dust Bowl on the Great Plains coincided with the Great Depression.The Dust Bowl, Geoff Cunfer, Southwest Minnesota State University. Shortly after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was inaugurated in 1933, drought and erosion combined to cause the Dust Bowl, shifting hundreds of thousands of displaced persons off their farms in the Midwest. From his inauguration onward, Roosevelt argued that restructuring of the economy would be needed to prevent another depression or avoid prolonging the current one. New Deal programs sought to stimulate demand and provide work and relief for the impoverished through increased government spending and the institution of financial reforms. During a \\"bank holiday\\" that lasted five days, the Emergency Banking Act was signed into law. It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under Treasury supervision, with federal loans available if needed. The Securities Act of 1933 comprehensively regulated the securities industry. This was followed by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which created the Securities and Exchange Commission. Although amended, key provisions of both Acts are still in force. Federal insurance of bank deposits was provided by the FDIC, and the Glass–Steagall Act. The Agricultural Adjustment Act provided incentives to cut farm production in order to raise farming prices. The National Recovery Administration (NRA) made a number of sweeping changes to the American economy. It forced businesses to work with government to set price codes through the NRA to fight deflationary \\"cut-throat competition\\" by the setting of minimum prices and wages, labor standards, and competitive conditions in all industries. It encouraged unions that would raise wages, to increase the purchasing power of the working class. The NRA was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1935. CCC workers constructing road, 1933. Over 3 million unemployed young men were taken out of the cities and placed into 2,600+ work camps managed by the CCC. These reforms, together with several other relief and recovery measures, are called the First New Deal. Economic stimulus was attempted through a new alphabet soup of agencies set up in 1933 and 1934 and previously extant agencies such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. By 1935, the \\"Second New Deal\\" added Social Security (which was later considerably extended through the Fair Deal), a jobs program for the unemployed (the Works Progress Administration, WPA) and, through the National Labor Relations Board, a strong stimulus to the growth of labor unions. In 1929, federal expenditures constituted only 3% of the GDP. The national debt as a proportion of GNP rose under Hoover from 20% to 40%. Roosevelt kept it at 40% until the war began, when it soared to 128%. By 1936, the main economic indicators had regained the levels of the late 1920s, except for unemployment, which remained high at 11%, although this was considerably lower than the 25% unemployment rate seen in 1933. In the spring of 1937, American industrial production exceeded that of 1929 and remained level until June 1937. In June 1937, the Roosevelt administration cut spending and increased taxation in an attempt to balance the federal budget.Robert Goldston, The Great Depression, Fawcett Publications, 1968, p. 228. The American economy then took a sharp downturn, lasting for 13 months through most of 1938. Industrial production fell almost 30 per cent within a few months and production of durable goods fell even faster. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938, rising from 5 million to more than 12 million in early 1938.Economic Fluctuations, Maurice W. Lee, Chairman of Economics Dept., Washington State College, published by R.D. Irwin Inc, Homewood, Illinois, 1955, p. 236. Manufacturing output fell by 37% from the 1937 peak and was back to 1934 levels.Business Cycles, James Arthur Estey, Purdue University, Prentice-Hall, 1950, pp. 22–23 chart. WPA employed 2–3 million at unskilled labor. Producers reduced their expenditures on durable goods, and inventories declined, but personal income was only 15% lower than it had been at the peak in 1937. As unemployment rose, consumers' expenditures declined, leading to further cutbacks in production. By May 1938 retail sales began to increase, employment improved, and industrial production turned up after June 1938.Maurice W. Lee, 1955. After the recovery from the Recession of 1937–38, conservatives were able to form a bipartisan conservative coalition to stop further expansion of the New Deal and, when unemployment dropped to 2% in the early 1940s, they abolished WPA, CCC and the PWA relief programs. Social Security remained in place. Between 1933 and 1939, federal expenditure tripled, and Roosevelt's critics charged that he was turning America into a socialist state.Schlesinger, Jr., Arthur M. The Coming of the New Deal: 1933–1935. Paperback ed. New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2003 [1958]. ; Schlesinger, Jr., Arthur M. The Politics of Upheaval: 1935–1936. Paperback ed. New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2003 [1960]. The Great Depression was a main factor in the implementation of social democracy and planned economies in European countries after World War II (see Marshall Plan). Keynesianism generally remained the most influential economic school in the United States and in parts of Europe until the periods between the 1970s and the 1980s, when Milton Friedman and other neoliberal economists formulated and propagated the newly created theories of neoliberalism and incorporated them into the Chicago School of Economics as an alternative approach to the study of economics. Neoliberalism went on to challenge the dominance of the Keynesian school of Economics in the mainstream academia and policy-making in the United States, having reached its peak in popularity in the election of the presidency of Ronald Reagan in the United States, and Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom.Lanny Ebenstein, Milton Friedman: A Biography (2007). ==Literature== The Great Depression has been the subject of much writing, as authors have sought to evaluate an era that caused both financial and emotional trauma. Perhaps the most noteworthy and famous novel written on the subject is The Grapes of Wrath, published in 1939 and written by John Steinbeck, who was awarded both the Nobel Prize for literature and the Pulitzer Prize for the work. The novel focuses on a poor family of sharecroppers who are forced from their home as drought, economic hardship, and changes in the agricultural industry occur during the Great Depression. Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is another important novella about a journey during the Great Depression. Additionally, Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird is set during the Great Depression. Margaret Atwood's Booker prize-winning The Blind Assassin is likewise set in the Great Depression, centering on a privileged socialite's love affair with a Marxist revolutionary. The era spurred the resurgence of social realism, practiced by many who started their writing careers on relief programs, especially the Federal Writers' Project in the U.S.David Taylor, Soul of a People: The WPA Writers' Project Uncovers Depression America (2009).Jerre Mangione, The Dream and the Deal: The Federal Writers' Project, 1935–1943 (1996)Jerrold Hirsch, Portrait of America: A Cultural History of the Federal Writers' Project (2006)Stacy I. Morgan, Rethinking Social Realism: African American art and literature, 1930–1953 (2004), p. 244. A number of works for younger audiences are also set during the Great Depression, among them the Kit Kittredge series of American Girl books written by Valerie Tripp and illustrated by Walter Rane, released to tie in with the dolls and playsets sold by the company. The stories, which take place during the early to mid 1930s in Cincinnati, focuses on the changes brought by the Depression to the titular character's family and how the Kittredges dealt with it. A theatrical adaptation of the series entitled Kit Kittredge: An American Girl was later released in 2008 to positive reviews. Similarly, Christmas After All, part of the Dear America series of books for older girls, take place in 1930s Indianapolis; while Kit Kittredge is told in a third-person viewpoint, Christmas After All is in the form of a fictional journal as told by the protagonist Minnie Swift as she recounts her experiences during the era, especially when her family takes in an orphan cousin from Texas. ==Naming== The term \\"The Great Depression\\" is most frequently attributed to British economist Lionel Robbins, whose 1934 book The Great Depression is credited with formalizing the phrase, though Hoover is widely credited with popularizing the term,William Manchester, The Glory and the Dream: A Narrative History of America, 1932–1972. informally referring to the downturn as a depression, with such uses as \\"Economic depression cannot be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement\\" (December 1930, Message to Congress), and \\"I need not recount to you that the world is passing through a great depression\\" (1931). Black Friday, May 9, 1873, Vienna Stock Exchange. The Panic of 1873 and Long Depression followed. The term \\"depression\\" to refer to an economic downturn dates to the 19th century, when it was used by varied Americans and British politicians and economists. Indeed, the first major American economic crisis, the Panic of 1819, was described by then-president James Monroe as \\"a depression\\", and the most recent economic crisis, the Depression of 1920–21, had been referred to as a \\"depression\\" by then-president Calvin Coolidge. Financial crises were traditionally referred to as \\"panics\\", most recently the major Panic of 1907, and the minor Panic of 1910–11, though the 1929 crisis was called \\"The Crash\\", and the term \\"panic\\" has since fallen out of use. At the time of the Great Depression, the term \\"The Great Depression\\" was already used to refer to the period 1873–96 (in the United Kingdom), or more narrowly 1873–79 (in the United States), which has retroactively been renamed the Long Depression. ===Other \\"great depressions\\"=== Other economic downturns have been called a \\"great depression\\", but none had been as widespread, or lasted for so long. Various states have experienced brief or extended periods of economic downturns, which were referred to as \\"depressions\\", but none have had such a widespread global impact. The collapse of the Soviet Union, and the breakdown of economic ties which followed, led to a severe economic crisis and catastrophic fall in the standards of living in the 1990s in post-Soviet states and the former Eastern Bloc,\\"Child poverty soars in eastern Europe\\", BBC News, October 11, 2000. which was even worse than the Great Depression.See \\"What Can Transition Economies Learn from the First Ten Years? A New World Bank Report,\\" in Transition Newsletter Worldbank.org, K-A.kgWho Lost Russia?, New York Times, October 8, 2000. Even before Russia's financial crisis of 1998, Russia's GDP was half of what it had been in the early 1990s, and some populations are still poorer than they were in 1989, including Moldova, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. ==Comparison with the Great Recession== The worldwide economic decline after 2008 has been compared to the 1930s.Adam Tooze, Crashed: How iters a Decade of Financial Crises Changed the World (2018) p. 41. The causes of the Great Recession seem similar to the Great Depression, but significant differences exist. The previous chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, had extensively studied the Great Depression as part of his doctoral work at MIT, and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and interest rates in ways that were not done in the 1930s. Bernanke's policies will undoubtedly be analyzed and scrutinized in the years to come, as economists debate the wisdom of his choices. Generally speaking, the recovery of the world's financial systems tended to be quicker during the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the late-2000s recession. 1928 and 1929 were the times in the 20th century that the wealth gap reached such skewed extremes;Evans-Pritchard, Ambrose (September 14, 2010). \\"IMF Fears 'Social Explosion' From World Jobs Crisis\\". The Daily Telegraph (London). \\"America and Europe face the worst jobs crisis since the 1930s and risk 'an explosion of social unrest' unless they tread carefully, the International Monetary Fund has warned.\\" half the unemployed had been out of work for over six months, something that was not repeated until the late-2000s recession. 2007 and 2008 eventually saw the world reach new levels of wealth gap inequality that rivalled the years of 1928 and 1929. ==See also== * Causes of the Great Depression * Cities in the Great Depression * Entertainment during the Great Depression * List of Depression-era outlaws * Timeline of the Great Depression ===General=== * Causes of World War II * Economic collapse * International relations (1919–1939) * Interwar France * Involuntary unemployment * List of economic crises ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Ambrosius, G. and W.

Roosevelt in the United States between 1933 and 1939. It responded to needs for relief, reform, and recovery from the Great Depression. Major federal programs and agencies included the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), the Civil Works Administration (CWA), the Farm Security Administration (FSA), the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 (NIRA) and the Social Security Administration (SSA). They provided support for farmers, the unemployed, youth and the elderly. The New Deal included new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and efforts to re-inflate the economy after prices had fallen sharply. New Deal programs included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The programs focused on what historians refer to as the \\"3 Rs\\": relief for the unemployed and poor, recovery of the economy back to normal levels, and reform of the financial system to prevent a repeat depression. The New Deal produced a political realignment, making the Democratic Party the majority (as well as the party that held the White House for seven out of the nine presidential terms from 1933 to 1969) with its base in liberal ideas, the South, big city machines and the newly empowered labor unions, and various ethnic groups. The Republicans were split, with conservatives opposing the entire New Deal as hostile to business and economic growth and liberals in support. The realignment crystallized into the New Deal coalition that dominated presidential elections into the 1960s while the opposing conservative coalition largely controlled Congress in domestic affairs from 1937 to 1964. ==Summary of First and Second New Deal programs== By 1936, the term \\"liberal\\" typically was used for supporters of the New Deal and \\"conservative\\" for its opponents.Elliot A. Rosen, The Republican Party in the Age of Roosevelt: Sources of Anti-Government Conservatism in the United States (2014). From 1934 to 1938, Roosevelt was assisted in his endeavors by a \\"pro- spender\\" majority in Congress (drawn from two-party, competitive, non-machine, progressive and left party districts). In the 1938 midterm election, Roosevelt and his liberal supporters lost control of Congress to the bipartisan conservative coalition. Many historians distinguish between a First New Deal (1933–1934) and a Second New Deal (1935–1936), with the second one more liberal and more controversial. The First New Deal (1933–1934) dealt with the pressing banking crises through the Emergency Banking Act and the 1933 Banking Act. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) provided $500 million ($ today) for relief operations by states and cities, while the short-lived CWA gave locals money to operate Make-work projects in 1933–1934. The Securities Act of 1933 was enacted to prevent a repeated stock market crash. The controversial work of the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was also part of the First New Deal. The Second New Deal in 1935–1936 included the National Labor Relations Act to protect labor organizing, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) relief program (which made the federal government the largest employer in the nation), the Social Security Act and new programs to aid tenant farmers and migrant workers. The final major items of New Deal legislation were the creation of the United States Housing Authority and the FSA, which both occurred in 1937; and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which set maximum hours and minimum wages for most categories of workers.Kennedy, David M. Freedom from Fear (1999). ch 12. The FSA was also one of the oversight authorities of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, which administered relief efforts to Puerto Rican citizens affected by the Great Depression. The economic downturn of 1937–1938 and the bitter split between the American Federation of Labor (AFL) and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) labor unions led to major Republican gains in Congress in 1938. Conservative Republicans and Democrats in Congress joined the informal conservative coalition. By 1942–1943, they shut down relief programs such as the WPA and the CCC and blocked major liberal proposals. Nonetheless, Roosevelt turned his attention to the war effort and won reelection in 1940–1944. Furthermore, the Supreme Court declared the NRA and the first version of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) unconstitutional, but the AAA was rewritten and then upheld. Republican president Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953–1961) left the New Deal largely intact, even expanding it in some areas. In the 1960s, Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society used the New Deal as inspiration for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs, which Republican Richard Nixon generally retained. However, after 1974 the call for deregulation of the economy gained bipartisan support., Martha Derthick, The Politics of Deregulation (1985), pp. 5–8. The New Deal regulation of banking (Glass–Steagall Act) lasted until it was suspended in the 1990s. Several New Deal programs remain active and those operating under the original names include the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). The largest programs still in existence today are the Social Security System and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). ==OriginsEconomic collapse (1929–1933)=== US annual real GDP from 1910 to 1960, with the years of the Great Depression (1929–1939) highlighted Unemployment rate in the United States from 1910–1960, with the years of the Great Depression (1929–1939) highlighted (accurate data begins in 1939) From 1929 to 1933 manufacturing output decreased by one third, which economist Milton Friedman called the Great Contraction. Prices fell by 20%, causing deflation that made repaying debts much harder. Unemployment in the United States increased from 4% to 25%. Additionally, one-third of all employed persons were downgraded to working part-time on much smaller paychecks. In the aggregate, almost 50% of the nation's human work-power was going unused.Kennedy, Freedom From Fear (1999) p. 87. Before the New Deal, deposits at banks were not insured. When thousands of banks closed, depositors lost their savings as at that time there was no national safety net, no public unemployment insurance and no Social Security. Relief for the poor was the responsibility of families, private charity and local governments, but as conditions worsened year by year demand skyrocketed and their combined resources increasingly fell far short of demand. The depression had devastated the nation. As Roosevelt took the oath of office at noon on March 4, 1933, all state governors had authorized bank holidays or restricted withdrawals—many Americans had little or no access to their bank accounts.Robert L. Fuller, \\"Phantom of Fear\\" The Banking Panic of 1933 (2011) pp. 156–157March 4 was a Saturday and banks were not open on weekends. On Monday Roosevelt officially closed all banks. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. The Coming of the New Deal (1959), p. 3; Brands, Traitor to his class (2008) p. 288. Farm income had fallen by over 50% since 1929. An estimated 844,000 non-farm mortgages had been foreclosed between 1930–1933, out of five million in all.Jonathan Alter, The Defining Moment: FDR's Hundred Days and the Triumph of Hope, esp. ch. 31. (2007); Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States (1977) series K220, N301. Political and business leaders feared revolution and anarchy. Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., who remained wealthy during the Depression, stated years later that \\"in those days I felt and said I would be willing to part with half of what I had if I could be sure of keeping, under law and order, the other half\\". ===Campaign=== The phrase \\"New Deal\\" was coined by an adviser to Roosevelt, Stuart Chase, although the term was originally used by Mark Twain in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. Upon accepting the 1932 Democratic nomination for president, Roosevelt promised \\"a new deal for the American people\\", saying:The phrase was perhaps borrowed from the title of Stuart Chase's book A New Deal published in February 1932 and serialized in the New Republic that summer. Gary Dean Best, Peddling panaceas: popular economists in the New Deal era (2005) p. 117.The phrase was also used by Gifford Pinchot in 1910, when he said in a speech rallying young men to political action to remove special interests from politics the following: \\"The people of the United States demand a new deal and a square deal\\". Address by Gifford Pinchot before the Roosevelt Club of St. Paul, Minnesota, June 11, 1910. ==First New Deal (1933–1934)== 1935 cartoon by Vaughn Shoemaker in which he parodied the New Deal as a card game with alphabetical agencies Roosevelt entered office without a specific set of plans for dealing with the Great Depression—so he improvised as Congress listened to a very wide variety of voices.Leuchtenburg pp. 33–35. Among Roosevelt's more famous advisers was an informal \\"Brain Trust\\", a group that tended to view pragmatic government intervention in the economy positively.Leuchtenburg p. 58. His choice for Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins, greatly influenced his initiatives. Her list of what her priorities would be if she took the job illustrates: \\"a forty-hour workweek, a minimum wage, worker's compensation, unemployment compensation, a federal law banning child labor, direct federal aid for unemployment relief, Social Security, a revitalized public employment service and health insurance\\". The New Deal policies drew from many different ideas proposed earlier in the 20th century. Assistant Attorney General Thurman Arnold led efforts that hearkened back to an anti-monopoly tradition rooted in American politics by figures such as Andrew Jackson and Thomas Jefferson. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, an influential adviser to many New Dealers, argued that \\"bigness\\" (referring, presumably, to corporations) was a negative economic force, producing waste and inefficiency. However, the anti- monopoly group never had a major impact on New Deal policy.Leuchtenburg p. 34. Other leaders such as Hugh S. Johnson of the NRA took ideas from the Woodrow Wilson Administration, advocating techniques used to mobilize the economy for World War I. They brought ideas and experience from the government controls and spending of 1917–1918. Other New Deal planners revived experiments suggested in the 1920s, such as the TVA. The \\"First New Deal\\" (1933–1934) encompassed the proposals offered by a wide spectrum of groups (not included was the Socialist Party, whose influence was all but destroyed).Leuchtenburg p. 188. This first phase of the New Deal was also characterized by fiscal conservatism (see Economy Act, below) and experimentation with several different, sometimes contradictory, cures for economic ills. Roosevelt created dozens of new agencies through Executive Orders. They are traditionally and typically known to Americans by their alphabetical initials. ===The First 100 Days (1933)=== The American people were generally extremely dissatisfied with the crumbling economy, mass unemployment, declining wages and profits and especially Herbert Hoover's policies such as the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act and the Revenue Act of 1932. Roosevelt entered office with enormous political capital. Americans of all political persuasions were demanding immediate action and Roosevelt responded with a remarkable series of new programs in the \\"first hundred days\\" of the administration, in which he met with Congress for 100 days. During those 100 days of lawmaking, Congress granted every request Roosevelt asked and passed a few programs (such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to insure bank accounts) that he opposed. Ever since, presidents have been judged against Roosevelt for what they accomplished in their first 100 days. Walter Lippmann famously noted: The economy had hit bottom in March 1933 and then started to expand. Economic indicators show the economy reached its lowest point in the first days of March, then began a steady, sharp upward recovery. Thus the Federal Reserve Index of Industrial Production sank to its lowest point of 52.8 in July 1932 (with 1935–1939 = 100) and was practically unchanged at 54.3 in March 1933. However, by July 1933 it reached 85.5, a dramatic rebound of 57% in four months. Recovery was steady and strong until 1937. Except for employment, the economy by 1937 surpassed the levels of the late 1920s. The Recession of 1937 was a temporary downturn. Private sector employment, especially in manufacturing, recovered to the level of the 1920s, but failed to advance further until the war. The U.S. population was 124,840,471 in 1932 and 128,824,829 in 1937, an increase of 3,984,468. The ratio of these numbers, times the number of jobs in 1932, means there was a need for 938,000 more jobs in 1937, to maintain the same employment level. Fiscal policy The Economy Act, drafted by Budget Director Lewis Williams Douglas, was passed on March 15, 1933. The act proposed to balance the \\"regular\\" (non-emergency) federal budget by cutting the salaries of government employees and cutting pensions to veterans by fifteen percent. It saved $500 million per year and reassured deficit hawks, such as Douglas, that the new president was fiscally conservative. Roosevelt argued there were two budgets: the \\"regular\\" federal budget, which he balanced; and the emergency budget, which was needed to defeat the depression. It was imbalanced on a temporary basis.Leuchtenburg p. 45–46; Robert Paul Browder and Thomas G. Smith, Independent: A Biography of Lewis W. Douglass (1986) Roosevelt initially favored balancing the budget, but soon found himself running spending deficits to fund his numerous programs. However, Douglas—rejecting the distinction between a regular and emergency budget—resigned in 1934 and became an outspoken critic of the New Deal. Roosevelt strenuously opposed the Bonus Bill that would give World War I veterans a cash bonus. Congress finally passed it over his veto in 1936 and the Treasury distributed $1.5 billion in cash as bonus welfare benefits to 4 million veterans just before the 1936 election.Leuchtenburg p. 171; Raymond Moley, The First New Deal (1966) New Dealers never accepted the Keynesian argument for government spending as a vehicle for recovery. Most economists of the era, along with Henry Morgenthau of the Treasury Department, rejected Keynesian solutions and favored balanced budgets.Leuchtenburg pp. 171, 245–46; Herbert Stein, Presidential economics: The making of economic policy from Roosevelt to Reagan and beyond (1984) Banking reform Crowd at New York's American Union Bank during a bank run early in the Great Depression Roosevelt's ebullient public personality, conveyed through his declaration that \\"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself\\" and his \\"fireside chats\\" on the radio did a great deal to help restore the nation's confidence At the beginning of the Great Depression, the economy was destabilized by bank failures followed by credit crunches. The initial reasons were substantial losses in investment banking, followed by bank runs. Bank runs occurred when a large number of customers withdrew their deposits because they believed the bank might become insolvent. As the bank run progressed, it generated a self- fulfilling prophecy: as more people withdrew their deposits, the likelihood of default increased and this encouraged further withdrawals. Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz have argued that the drain of money out of the banking system caused the monetary supply to shrink, forcing the economy to likewise shrink. As credit and economic activity diminished, price deflation followed, causing further economic contraction with disastrous impact on banks.Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 (1963) pp. 340–43 Between 1929 and 1933, 40% of all banks (9,490 out of 23,697 banks) failed.R. W. Hafer, The Federal Reserve System (Greenwood, 2005) p 18 Much of the Great Depression's economic damage was caused directly by bank runs.Ben Bernanke, \\"Nonmonetary effects of the financial crisis in the propagation of the Great Depression\\", (1983) American Economic Review. Am 73#3 257–76. Herbert Hoover had already considered a bank holiday to prevent further bank runs, but rejected the idea because he was afraid to incite a panic. However, Roosevelt gave a radio address, held in the atmosphere of a Fireside Chat. He explained to the public in simple terms the causes of the banking crisis, what the government would do, and how the population could help. He closed all the banks in the country, and kept them all closed until new legislation could be passed. On March 9, 1933, Roosevelt sent to Congress the Emergency Banking Act, drafted in large part by Hoover's top advisors. The act was passed and signed into law the same day. It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under Treasury supervision, with federal loans available if needed. Three-quarters of the banks in the Federal Reserve System reopened within the next three days. Billions of dollars in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month, thus stabilizing the banking system.Silber, William L. “Why Did FDR’s Bank Holiday Succeed?” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review, (July 2009), pp 19-30 online By the end of 1933, 4,004 small local banks were permanently closed and merged into larger banks. Their deposits totaled $3.6 billion. Depositors lost $540 million () and eventually received on average 85 cents on the dollar of their deposits. The Glass–Steagall Act limited commercial bank securities activities and affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms to regulate speculations. It also established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insured deposits for up to $2,500, ending the risk of runs on banks.Susan E. Kennedy, The Banking Crisis of 1933 (1973) This banking reform offered unprecedented stability as while throughout the 1920s more than five hundred banks failed per year, it was less than ten banks per year after 1933.Kennedy, Freedom From Fear (1999) pp. 65, 366 Monetary reform Under the gold standard, the United States kept the dollar convertible to gold. The Federal Reserve would have had to execute an expansionary monetary policy to fight the deflation and to inject liquidity into the banking system to prevent it from crumbling—but lower interest rates would have led to a gold outflow.Randall E. Parker, Reflections on the Great Depression, Edward Elgar Publishing, 2003, , p. 20 Under the gold standards, price–specie flow mechanism countries that lost gold, but nevertheless wanted to maintain the gold standard, had to permit their money supply to decrease and the domestic price level to decline (deflation).Randall E. Parker, Reflections on the Great Depression, Edward Elgar Publishing, 2003, , p. 16 As long as the Federal Reserve had to defend the gold parity of the dollar it had to sit idle while the banking system crumbled. In March and April in a series of laws and executive orders, the government suspended the gold standard. Roosevelt stopped the outflow of gold by forbidding the export of gold except under license from the Treasury. Anyone holding significant amounts of gold coinage was mandated to exchange it for the existing fixed price of U.S. dollars. The Treasury no longer paid out gold for dollars and gold would no longer be considered valid legal tender for debts in private and public contracts. The dollar was allowed to float freely on foreign exchange markets with no guaranteed price in gold. With the passage of the Gold Reserve Act in 1934, the nominal price of gold was changed from $20.67 per troy ounce to $35. These measures enabled the Federal Reserve to increase the amount of money in circulation to the level the economy needed. Markets immediately responded well to the suspension in the hope that the decline in prices would finally end. In her essay \\"What ended the Great Depression?\\" (1992), Christina Romer argued that this policy raised industrial production by 25% until 1937 and by 50% until 1942. Securities Act of 1933 Before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, securities were unregulated at the federal level. Even firms whose securities were publicly traded published no regular reports or even worse rather misleading reports based on arbitrarily selected data. To avoid another Wall Street Crash, the Securities Act of 1933 was enacted. It required the disclosure of the balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and the names and compensations of corporate officers for firms whose securities were traded. Additionally, the reports had to be verified by independent auditors. In 1934, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was established to regulate the stock market and prevent corporate abuses relating to corporate reporting and the sale of securities.Kennedy, Freedom From Fear (1999) p. 367 Repeal of Prohibition In a measure that garnered substantial popular support for his New Deal, Roosevelt moved to put to rest one of the most divisive cultural issues of the 1920s. He signed the bill to legalize the manufacture and sale of alcohol, an interim measure pending the repeal of prohibition, for which a constitutional amendment of repeal (the 21st) was already in process. The repeal amendment was ratified later in 1933. States and cities gained additional new revenue and Roosevelt secured his popularity especially in the cities and ethnic areas by legalizing alcohol.Leuchtenburg, Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal pp. 46–47 ===Relief=== Relief was the immediate effort to help the one-third of the population that was hardest hit by the depression. Relief was also aimed at providing temporary help to suffering and unemployed Americans. Local and state budgets were sharply reduced because of falling tax revenue, but New Deal relief programs were used not just to hire the unemployed but also to build needed schools, municipal buildings, waterworks, sewers, streets, and parks according to local specifications. While the regular Army and Navy budgets were reduced, Roosevelt juggled relief funds to provide for their claimed needs. All of the CCC camps were directed by army officers, whose salaries came from the relief budget. The PWA built numerous warships, including two aircraft carriers; the money came from the PWA agency. PWA also built warplanes, while the WPA built military bases and airfields. Public works Public Works Administration Project Bonneville Dam To prime the pump and cut unemployment, the NIRA created the Public Works Administration (PWA), a major program of public works, which organized and provided funds for the building of useful works such as government buildings, airports, hospitals, schools, roads, bridges and dams.Mastering Modern World History by Norman Lowe, second edition, p. 117 From 1933 to 1935 PWA spent $3.3 billion with private companies to build 34,599 projects, many of them quite large.Leuchtenburg pp. 70, 133–34; Jason Scott Smith, Building New Deal Liberalism: The Political Economy of Public Works, 1933–1956 (2005) Under Roosevelt, many unemployed persons were put to work on a wide range of government-financed public works projects, building bridges, airports, dams, post offices, hospitals and hundreds of thousands of miles of road. Through reforestation and flood control, they reclaimed millions of hectares of soil from erosion and devastation. As noted by one authority, Roosevelt's New Deal \\"was literally stamped on the American landscape\\".Time-Life Books, Library of Nations: United States, Sixth European English language printing, 1989 Farm and rural programs Pumping water by hand from the sole water supply in this section of Wilder, Tennessee (Tennessee Valley Authority, 1942) The rural U.S. was a high priority for Roosevelt and his energetic Secretary of Agriculture, Henry A. Wallace. Roosevelt believed that full economic recovery depended upon the recovery of agriculture and raising farm prices was a major tool, even though it meant higher food prices for the poor living in cities. Many rural people lived in severe poverty, especially in the South. Major programs addressed to their needs included the Resettlement Administration (RA), the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), rural welfare projects sponsored by the WPA, National Youth Administration (NYA), Forest Service and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), including school lunches, building new schools, opening roads in remote areas, reforestation and purchase of marginal lands to enlarge national forests. In 1933, the Roosevelt administration launched the Tennessee Valley Authority, a project involving dam construction planning on an unprecedented scale to curb flooding, generate electricity and modernize poor farms in the Tennessee Valley region of the Southern United States. Under the Farmers' Relief Act of 1933, the government paid compensation to farmers who reduced output, thereby raising prices. Because of this legislation, the average income of farmers almost doubled by 1937. In the 1920s, farm production had increased dramatically thanks to mechanization, more potent insecticides and increased use of fertilizer. Due to an overproduction of agricultural products, farmers faced severe and chronic agricultural depression throughout the 1920s. The Great Depression even worsened the agricultural crises and at the beginning of 1933 agricultural markets nearly faced collapse.Paul S. Boyer, The Oxford Companion to United States History, Oxford University Press, 2001, , pp. 20, 21 Farm prices were so low that in Montana wheat was rotting in the fields because it could not be profitably harvested. In Oregon, sheep were slaughtered and left to rot because meat prices were not sufficient to warrant transportation to markets.Peter Clemens, Prosperity, Depression and the New Deal: The USA 1890–1954, Hodder Education, 2008, , p. 106 Roosevelt was keenly interested in farm issues and believed that true prosperity would not return until farming was prosperous. Many different programs were directed at farmers. The first 100 days produced the Farm Security Act to raise farm incomes by raising the prices farmers received, which was achieved by reducing total farm output. The Agricultural Adjustment Act created the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) in May 1933. The act reflected the demands of leaders of major farm organizations (especially the Farm Bureau) and reflected debates among Roosevelt's farm advisers such as Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace, M.L. Wilson, Rexford Tugwell and George Peek.Schlesinger, Coming of the New Deal pp. 27–84 The AAA aimed to raise prices for commodities through artificial scarcity. The AAA used a system of domestic allotments, setting total output of corn, cotton, dairy products, hogs, rice, tobacco, and wheat. The farmers themselves had a voice in the process of using the government to benefit their incomes. The AAA paid land owners subsidies for leaving some of their land idle with funds provided by a new tax on food processing. To force up farm prices to the point of \\"parity,\\" of growing cotton was plowed up, bountiful crops were left to rot and six million piglets were killed and discarded.Ronald L. Heinemann, Depression and New Deal in Virginia. (1983) p. 107 The idea was to give farmers a \\"fair exchange value\\" for their products in relation to the general economy (\\"parity level\\").Paul S. Boyder, The Oxford Companion to United States History, Oxford University Press, 2001, , p. 21 Farm incomes and the income for the general population recovered fast since the beginning of 1933.Clemens, Prosperity, Depression and the New Deal: The USA 1890–1954 p. 137 Food prices remained still well below the 1929 peak.Badger, New Deal pp. 89. 153–57. for price data and farm income see Statistical Abstract 1940 online The AAA established an important and long-lasting federal role in the planning of the entire agricultural sector of the economy and was the first program on such a scale for the troubled agricultural economy. The original AAA targeted landowners, and therefore did not provide for any sharecroppers or tenants or farm laborers who might become unemployed.Raj Patel and Jim Goodman, \\"The Long New Deal\\", Journal of Peasant Studies, Vol 47, Issue 3, pp431-463 A Gallup poll printed in the Washington Post revealed that a majority of the American public opposed the AAA.Barry Cushman, Rethinking the New Deal Court (1998) p. 34 In 1936, the Supreme Court declared the AAA to be unconstitutional, stating that \\"a statutory plan to regulate and control agricultural production, [is] a matter beyond the powers delegated to the federal government\\". The AAA was replaced by a similar program that did win Court approval. Instead of paying farmers for letting fields lie barren, this program subsidized them for planting soil-enriching crops such as alfalfa that would not be sold on the market. Federal regulation of agricultural production has been modified many times since then, but together with large subsidies is still in effect today. The Farm Tenancy Act in 1937 was the last major New Deal legislation that concerned farming. It created the Farm Security Administration (FSA), which replaced the Resettlement Administration. The Food Stamp Plan—a major new welfare program for urban poor—was established in 1939 to provide stamps to poor people who could use them to purchase food at retail outlets. The program ended during wartime prosperity in 1943 but was restored in 1961. It survived into the 21st century with little controversy because it was seen to benefit the urban poor, food producers, grocers, and wholesalers as well as farmers, thus it gained support from both liberal and conservative Congressmen. In 2013, Tea Party activists in the House nonetheless tried to end the program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, while the Senate fought to preserve it.Rachel Louise Moran, \\"Consuming Relief: Food Stamps and the New Welfare of the New Deal,\\" Journal of American History, March 2011, Vol. 97 Issue 4, pp. 1001–22 onlineAlan Bjerga & Derek Wallbank, \\"Food Stamps Loom Over Negotiations to Pass Farm Bill\\" Bloomberg Oct 30, 2013 ===Recovery=== Recovery was the effort in numerous programs to restore the economy to normal health. By most economic indicators, this was achieved by 1937—except for unemployment, which remained stubbornly high until World War II began. Recovery was designed to help the economy bounce back from depression. Economic historians led by Price Fishback have examined the impact of New Deal spending on improving health conditions in the 114 largest cities, 1929–1937. They estimated that every additional $153,000 in relief spending (in 1935 dollars, or $1.95 million in year 2000 dollars) was associated with a reduction of one infant death, one suicide and 2.4 deaths from infectious disease.Price V. Fishback, Michael R. Haines, and Shawn Kantor, \\"Births, Deaths, and New Deal relief during the Great Depression.\\" The Review of Economics and Statistics 89.1 (2007): 1–14, citing page online NRA \\"Blue Eagle\\" campaign National Recovery Administration Blue Eagle Manufacturing employment in the U.S. from 1920 to 1940Data was obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, Statistical Abstract and converted into SVG format by me. The numbers come from this U.S. Census document, p. 17, column 127. Note that the graph only covers factory employment. From 1929 to 1933, the industrial economy suffered from a vicious cycle of deflation. Since 1931, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the voice of the nation's organized business, promoted an anti- deflationary scheme that would permit trade associations to cooperate in government-instigated cartels to stabilize prices within their industries. While existing antitrust laws clearly forbade such practices, organized business found a receptive ear in the Roosevelt Administration.Bernard Bellush, The Failure of the NRA, (1976) Roosevelt's advisers believed that excessive competition and technical progress had led to overproduction and lowered wages and prices, which they believed lowered demand and employment (deflation). He argued that government economic planning was necessary to remedy this. New Deal economists argued that cut-throat competition had hurt many businesses and that with prices having fallen 20% and more, \\"deflation\\" exacerbated the burden of debt and would delay recovery. They rejected a strong move in Congress to limit the workweek to 30 hours. Instead their remedy, designed in cooperation with big business, was the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA). It included stimulus funds for the WPA to spend and sought to raise prices, give more bargaining power for unions (so the workers could purchase more) and reduce harmful competition. At the center of the NIRA was the National Recovery Administration (NRA), headed by former General Hugh S. Johnson, who had been a senior economic official in World War I. Johnson called on every business establishment in the nation to accept a stopgap \\"blanket code\\": a minimum wage of between 20 and 45 cents per hour, a maximum workweek of 35–45 hours and the abolition of child labor. Johnson and Roosevelt contended that the \\"blanket code\\" would raise consumer purchasing power and increase employment.Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. The Coming of the New Deal (1959), 87–135 To mobilize political support for the NRA, Johnson launched the \\"NRA Blue Eagle\\" publicity campaign to boost what he called \\"industrial self-government\\". The NRA brought together leaders in each industry to design specific sets of codes for that industry—the most important provisions were anti-deflationary floors below which no company would lower prices or wages and agreements on maintaining employment and production. In a remarkably short time, the NRA announced agreements from almost every major industry in the nation. By March 1934, industrial production was 45% higher than in March 1933.Federal Reserve System, National Summary of Business Conditions (1936) NRA Administrator Hugh Johnson was showing signs of mental breakdown due to the extreme pressure and workload of running the National Recovery Administration.Black, Conrad. Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Champion of Freedom. New York: PublicAffairs, 2003. After two meetings with Roosevelt and an abortive resignation attempt, Johnson resigned on September 24, 1934 and Roosevelt replaced the position of Administrator with a new National Industrial Recovery Board,\\"Executive Order 6859 – Reorganizing the N.R.A. and Establishing the National Industrial Recovery Board.\\" September 27, 1934.

Compiled by Robert B. Matchette, et al. Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, 1995. of which Donald Richberg was named Executive Director. On May 27, 1935, the NRA was found to be unconstitutional by a unanimous decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Schechter v. United States. After the end of the NRA, quotas in the oil industry were fixed by the Railroad Commission of Texas with Tom Connally's federal Hot Oil Act of 1935, which guaranteed that illegal \\"hot oil\\" would not be sold.The Handbook of Texas Online: Connally Hot Oil Act of 1935 By the time NRA ended in May 1935, well over 2 million employers accepted the new standards laid down by the NRA, which had introduced a minimum wage and an eight-hour workday, together with abolishing child labor. These standards were reintroduced by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Housing sector The New Deal had an important impact in the housing field. The New Deal followed and increased President Hoover's lead-and-seek measures. The New Deal sought to stimulate the private home building industry and increase the number of individuals who owned homes. The New Deal implemented two new housing agencies; Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). HOLC set uniform national appraisal methods and simplified the mortgage process. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) created national standards for home construction., David C. Wheelock, \\"The Federal response to home mortgage distress: Lessons from the Great Depression.\\" Review 90 (2008). online ===Reform=== Reform was based on the assumption that the depression was caused by the inherent instability of the market and that government intervention was necessary to rationalize and stabilize the economy and to balance the interests of farmers, business and labor. Reforms targeted the causes of the depression and sought to prevent a crisis like it from happening again. In other words, financially rebuilding the U.S. while ensuring not to repeat history. Trade liberalization Most economic historians assert that protectionist policies, culminating in the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930, worsened the Depression. Roosevelt already spoke against the act while campaigning for president during 1932. In 1934, the Reciprocal Tariff Act was drafted by Cordell Hull. It gave the president power to negotiate bilateral, reciprocal trade agreements with other countries. The act enabled Roosevelt to liberalize American trade policy around the globe and it is widely credited with ushering in the era of liberal trade policy that persists to this day. Puerto Rico A separate set of programs operated in Puerto Rico, headed by the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration. It promoted land reform and helped small farms, it set up farm cooperatives, promoted crop diversification and helped the local industry. The Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration was directed by Juan Pablo Montoya Sr. from 1935 to 1937. ==Second New Deal (1935–1936)== In the spring of 1935, responding to the setbacks in the Court, a new skepticism in Congress and the growing popular clamor for more dramatic action, New Dealers passed important new initiatives. Historians refer to them as the \\"Second New Deal\\" and note that it was more liberal and more controversial than the \\"First New Deal\\" of 1933–1934. ===Social Security Act=== Social Security benefits Until 1935, only a dozen states had implemented old-age insurance, and these programs were woefully underfunded. Just one state (Wisconsin) had an insurance program. The United States was the only modern industrial country where people faced the Depression without any national system of social security. The work programs of the \\"First New Deal\\" such as CWA and FERA were designed for immediate relief, for a year or two.David M. Kennedy, Freedom From Fear, The American People in Depression and War 1929–1945, (1999) p. 258, 260 The most important program of 1935, and perhaps of the New Deal itself, was the Social Security Act. It established a permanent system of universal retirement pensions (Social Security), unemployment insurance and welfare benefits for the handicapped and needy children in families without a father present. It established the framework for the U.S. welfare system. Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund—he said: \\"We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program\\".Social Security History. Ssa.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-14. ===Labor relations=== The National Labor Relations Act of 1935, also known as the Wagner Act, finally guaranteed workers the rights to collective bargaining through unions of their own choice. The Act also established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and to suppress the repeated labor disturbances. The Wagner Act did not compel employers to reach agreement with their employees, but it opened possibilities for American labor.David M. Kennedy, Freedom From Fear, The American People in Depression and War 1929–1945, Oxford University Press, 1999, , p. 291 The result was a tremendous growth of membership in the labor unions, especially in the mass- production sector, led by the older and larger American Federation of Labor and the new, more radical Congress of Industrial Organizations. Labor thus became a major component of the New Deal political coalition. However, the intense battle for members between the AFL and the CIO coalitions weakened labor's power.Irving Bernstein, \\"The Growth of American Unions,\\" American Economic Review 44#3 (1954), pp. 301–318 online The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 set maximum hours (44 per week) and minimum wages (25 cents per hour) for most categories of workers. Child labor of children under the age of 16 was forbidden, children under 18 years were forbidden to work in hazardous employment. As a result, the wages of 300,000 workers, especially in the South, were increased and the hours of 1.3 million were reduced.Clemens, Prosperity, Depression, and the New Deal: The USA 1890–1954 p. 109 It was the last major New Deal legislation and it passed with support of Northern industrialists who wanted to stop the drain of jobs to the low-wage South. ===Works Progress Administration=== Works Progress Administration (WPA) poster promoting the LaGuardia Airport project (1937) Roosevelt nationalized unemployment relief through the Works Progress Administration (WPA), headed by close friend Harry Hopkins. Roosevelt had insisted that the projects had to be costly in terms of labor, beneficial in the long term and the WPA was forbidden to compete with private enterprises—therefore the workers had to be paid smaller wages., Kennedy, Freedom From Fear pp. 250–52 The Works Progress Administration (WPA) was created to return the unemployed to the workforce.Peter Fearon, War, Prosperity, and Depression (1987) The WPA financed a variety of projects such as hospitals, schools, and roads, and employed more than 8.5 million workers who built 650,000 miles of highways and roads, 125,000 public buildings as well as bridges, reservoirs, irrigation systems, parks, playgrounds and so on. Prominent projects were the Lincoln Tunnel, the Triborough Bridge, the LaGuardia Airport, the Overseas Highway and the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge.Kennedy, Freedom From Fear p. 252 The Rural Electrification Administration used cooperatives to bring electricity to rural areas, many of which still operate.Deward Clayton Brown, Electricity for Rural America: The Fight for the REA (1980) The National Youth Administration was another semi-autonomous WPA program for youth. Its Texas director, Lyndon B. Johnson, later used the NYA as a model for some of his Great Society programs in the 1960s.Lorraine Brown, \\"Federal Theatre: Melodrama, Social Protest, and Genius,\\" U.S. Library of Congress Quarterly Journal, 1979, Vol. 36 Issue 1, pp. 18–37 The WPA was organized by states, but New York City had its own branch Federal One, which created jobs for writers, musicians, artists and theater personnel. It became a hunting ground for conservatives searching for communist employees. The Federal Writers' Project operated in every state, where it created a famous guide book—it also catalogued local archives and hired many writers, including Margaret Walker, Zora Neale Hurston and Anzia Yezierska, to document folklore. Other writers interviewed elderly ex-slaves and recorded their stories. Under the Federal Theater Project, headed by charismatic Hallie Flanagan, actresses and actors, technicians, writers and directors put on stage productions. The tickets were inexpensive or sometimes free, making theater available to audiences unaccustomed to attending plays. One Federal Art Project paid 162 trained woman artists on relief to paint murals or create statues for newly built post offices and courthouses. Many of these works of art can still be seen in public buildings around the country, along with murals sponsored by the Treasury Relief Art Project of the Treasury Department.Hemming, Heidi and Julie Hemming Savage, Women Making America, Clotho Press, 2009, pp. 243–44.Sue Bridwell Beckham, Depression Post Office Murals and Southern Culture: A Gentle Reconstruction (1989) During its existence, the Federal Theatre Project provided jobs for circus people, musicians, actors, artists and playwrights, together with increasing public appreciation of the arts. ===Tax policy=== In 1935, Roosevelt called for a tax program called the Wealth Tax Act (Revenue Act of 1935) to redistribute wealth. The bill imposed an income tax of 79% on incomes over $5 million. Since that was an extraordinary high income in the 1930s, the highest tax rate actually covered just one individual—John D. Rockefeller. The bill was expected to raise only about $250 million in additional funds, so revenue was not the primary goal. Morgenthau called it \\"more or less a campaign document\\". In a private conversation with Raymond Moley, Roosevelt admitted that the purpose of the bill was \\"stealing Huey Long's thunder\\" by making Long's supporters of his own. At the same time, it raised the bitterness of the rich who called Roosevelt \\"a traitor to his class\\" and the wealth tax act a \\"soak the rich tax\\". A tax called the undistributed profits tax was enacted in 1936. This time the primary purpose was revenue, since Congress had enacted the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act, calling for payments of $2 billion to World War I veterans. The bill established the persisting principle that retained corporate earnings could be taxed. Paid dividends were tax deductible by corporations. Its proponents intended the bill to replace all other corporation taxes—believing this would stimulate corporations to distribute earnings and thus put more cash and spending power in the hands of individuals.John K. McNulty, \\"Unintegrated Corporate and Individual Income Taxes: USA\\", in: Paul Kirchhof et al., International and Comparative Taxation, Kluwer Law International, 2002, , p. 173 In the end, Congress watered down the bill, setting the tax rates at 7 to 27% and largely exempting small enterprises. Facing widespread and fierce criticism,Benjamin Graham. Security Analysis: The Classic 1940 Edition. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2002. pp. 386–287 the tax deduction of paid dividends was repealed in 1938. ===Housing Act of 1937=== The United States Housing Act of 1937 created the United States Housing Authority within the U.S. Department of the Interior. It was one of the last New Deal agencies created. The bill passed in 1937 with some Republican support to abolish slums. ==Court-packing plan and jurisprudential shift== When the Supreme Court started abolishing New Deal programs as unconstitutional, Roosevelt launched a surprise counter-attack in early 1937. He proposed adding five new justices, but conservative Democrats revolted, led by the Vice President. The Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937 failed—it never reached a vote. Momentum in Congress and public opinion shifted to the right and very little new legislation was passed expanding the New Deal. However, retirements allowed Roosevelt to put supporters on the Court and it stopped killing New Deal programs.Jeff Jeff Shesol, Supreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt Vs. The Supreme Court (2010) online review ==Recession of 1937 and recovery== The Roosevelt administration was under assault during Roosevelt's second term, which presided over a new dip in the Great Depression in the fall of 1937 that continued through most of 1938. Production and profits declined sharply. Unemployment jumped from 14.3% in May 1937 to 19.0% in June 1938. The downturn was perhaps due to nothing more than the familiar rhythms of the business cycle, but until 1937 Roosevelt had claimed responsibility for the excellent economic performance. That backfired in the recession and the heated political atmosphere of 1937.Kennedy, Freedom From Fear p. 352 Keynes did not think that The New Deal under Roosevelt ended the Great Depression: \\"It is, it seems, politically impossible for a capitalistic democracy to organize expenditure on the scale necessary to make the grand experiments which would prove my case — except in war conditions.\\"Quoted by P. Renshaw. Journal of Contemporary History. 1999 vol. 34 (3). p.377-364 ==World War II and full employment== Female factory workers in 1942, Long Beach, California The U.S. reached full employment after entering World War II in December 1941. Under the special circumstances of war mobilization, massive war spending doubled the gross national product (GNP).GNP was $99.7 billion in 1940 and $210.1 billion in 1944. Historical Statistics (1976) series F1. Military Keynesianism brought full employment and federal contracts were cost-plus. Instead of competitive bidding to get lower prices, the government gave out contracts that promised to pay all the expenses plus a modest profit. Factories hired everyone they could find regardless of their lack of skills—they simplified work tasks and trained the workers, with the federal government paying all the costs. Millions of farmers left marginal operations, students quit school and housewives joined the labor force. The emphasis was for war supplies as soon as possible, regardless of cost and inefficiencies. Industry quickly absorbed the slack in the labor force and the tables turned such that employers needed to actively and aggressively recruit workers. As the military grew, new labor sources were needed to replace the 12 million men serving in the military. Propaganda campaigns started pleading for people to work in the war factories. The barriers for married women, the old, the unskilled—and (in the North and West) the barriers for racial minorities—were lowered. ===Federal budget soars=== In 1929, federal expenditures accounted for only 3% of GNP. Between 1933 and 1939, federal expenditures tripled, but the national debt as a percent of GNP showed little change. Spending on the war effort quickly eclipsed spending on New Deal programs. In 1944, government spending on the war effort exceeded 40% of GNP. The U.S. economy experienced dramatic growth during the Second World War mostly due to the deemphasis of free enterprise in favor of the imposition of strict controls on prices and wages. These controls shared broad support among labor and business, resulting in cooperation between the two groups and the U.S. government. This cooperation resulted in the government subsidizing business and labor through both direct and indirect methods.Vatter, The U.S. Economy in World War II ===Wartime welfare projects=== Conservative domination of Congress during the war meant that all welfare projects and reforms had to have their approval, which was given when business supported the project. For example, the Coal Mines Inspection and Investigation Act of 1941 significantly reduced fatality rates in the coal- mining industry, saving workers' lives and company money.Curtis E. Harvey, Coal in Appalachia: an economic analysis In terms of welfare, the New Dealers wanted benefits for everyone according to need. However, conservatives proposed benefits based on national service—especially tied to military service or working in war industries—and their approach won out. The Community Facilities Act of 1940 (the Lanham Act) provided federal funds to defense- impacted communities where the population had soared and local facilities were overwhelmed. It provided money for the building of segregated housing for war workers as well as recreational facilities, water and sanitation plants, hospitals, day care centers and schools. The Servicemen's Dependents Allowance Act of 1942 provided family allowances for dependents of enlisted men. Emergency grants to states were authorized in 1942 for programs for day care for children of working mothers. In 1944, pensions were authorized for all physically or mentally helpless children of deceased veterans regardless of the age of the child at the date the claim was filed or at the time of the veteran's death, provided the child was disabled at the age of sixteen and that the disability continued to the date of the claim. The Public Health Service Act, which was passed that same year, expanded federal-state public health programs and increased the annual amount for grants for public health services. The Emergency Maternity and Infant Care Program (EMIC), introduced in March 1943 by the Children's Bureau, provided free maternity care and medical treatment during an infant's first year for the wives and children of military personnel in the four lowest enlisted pay grades. One out of seven births was covered during its operation. EMIC paid $127 million to state health departments to cover the care of 1.2 million new mothers and their babies. The average cost of EMIC maternity cases completed was $92.49 for medical and hospital care. A striking effect was the sudden rapid decline in home births as most mothers now had paid hospital maternity care.Nathan Sinai, and Odin Waldemar Anderson. \\"EMIC (Emergency Maternity and Infant Care).

The G.I. Bill (Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944) was a landmark piece of legislation, providing 16 million returning veterans with benefits such as housing, educational and unemployment assistance and played a major role in the postwar expansion of the American middle class.Michael J. Bennett, When Dreams Came True: The GI Bill and the Making of Modern America (1999) ===Fair Employment Practices=== In response to the March on Washington Movement led by A. Philip Randolph, Roosevelt promulgated Executive Order 8802 in June 1941, which established the President's Committee on Fair Employment Practices (FEPC) \\"to receive and investigate complaints of discrimination\\" so that \\"there shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or government because of race, creed, color, or national origin\\".Merl E. Reed, Seedtime for the Modern Civil Rights Movement: The President's Committee on Fair Employment Practice, 1941–1946 (1991) ===Growing equality of income=== A major result of the full employment at high wages was a sharp, long lasting decrease in the level of income inequality (Great Compression). The gap between rich and poor narrowed dramatically in the area of nutrition because food rationing and price controls provided a reasonably priced diet to everyone. White collar workers did not typically receive overtime and therefore the gap between white collar and blue collar income narrowed. Large families that had been poor during the 1930s had four or more wage earners and these families shot to the top one-third income bracket. Overtime provided large paychecks in war industriesKennedy, Freedom from Fear ch 18 and average living standards rose steadily, with real wages rising by 44% in the four years of war, while the percentage of families with an annual income of less than $2,000 fell from 75% to 25% of the population.America in our time: from World War II to Nixon—what happened and why by Godfrey Hodgson In 1941, 40% of all American families lived on less than the $1,500 per year defined as necessary by the Works Progress Administration for a modest standard of living. The median income stood at $2,000 a year, while 8 million workers earned below the legal minimum. From 1939 to 1944, wages and salaries more than doubled, with overtime pay and the expansion of jobs leading to a 70% rise in average weekly earnings during the course of the war. Membership in organized labor increased by 50% between 1941 and 1945 and because the War Labor Board sought labor-management peace, new workers were encouraged to participate in the existing labor organizations, thereby receiving all the benefits of union membership such as improved working conditions, better fringe benefits and higher wages. As noted by William H. Chafe, \\"with full employment, higher wages and social welfare benefits provided under government regulations, American workers experienced a level of well-being that, for many, had never occurred before\\". As a result of the new prosperity, consumer expenditures rose by nearly 50%, from $61.7 billion at the start of the war to $98.5 billion by 1944. Individual savings accounts climbed almost sevenfold during the course of the war. The share of total income held by the top 5% of wage earners fell from 22% to 17% while the bottom 40% increased their share of the economic pie. In addition, during the course of the war the proportion of the American population earning less than $3,000 (in 1968 dollars) fell by half.The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II by William H. Chafe ==Legacy== The New Deal was the inspiration for President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society in the 1960s: Johnson (on right) headed the Texas NYA and was elected to Congress in 1938 Analysts agree the New Deal produced a new political coalition that sustained the Democratic Party as the majority party in national politics into the 1960s. A 2013 study found that \\"an average increase in New Deal relief and public works spending resulted in a 5.4 percentage point increase in the 1936 Democratic voting share and a smaller amount in 1940. The estimated persistence of this shift suggests that New Deal spending increased long-term Democratic support by 2 to 2.5 percentage points. Thus, it appears that Roosevelt's early, decisive actions created long-lasting positive benefits for the Democratic party... The New Deal did play an important role in consolidating Democratic gains for at least two decades\\". However, there is disagreement about whether it marked a permanent change in values. Cowie and Salvatore in 2008 argued that it was a response to Depression and did not mark a commitment to a welfare state because the U.S. has always been too individualistic. MacLean rejected the idea of a definitive political culture. She says they overemphasized individualism and ignored the enormous power that big capital wields, the Constitutional restraints on radicalism and the role of racism, antifeminism and homophobia. She warns that accepting Cowie and Salvatore's argument that conservatism's ascendancy is inevitable would dismay and discourage activists on the left. Klein responds that the New Deal did not die a natural death—it was killed off in the 1970s by a business coalition mobilized by such groups as the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, trade organizations, conservative think tanks and decades of sustained legal and political attacks. Historians generally agree that during Roosevelt's 12 years in office there was a dramatic increase in the power of the federal government as a whole.Herman, Arthur. Freedom's Forge: How American Business Produced Victory in World War II, pp. 68–75, 119, 254, 329–30, 340–41, Random House, New York, NY, 2012. .Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Production in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, p. 8, Cypress, CA, 2013. . Roosevelt also established the presidency as the prominent center of authority within the federal government. Roosevelt created a large array of agencies protecting various groups of citizens—workers, farmers and others—who suffered from the crisis and thus enabled them to challenge the powers of the corporations. In this way, the Roosevelt administration generated a set of political ideas—known as New Deal liberalism—that remained a source of inspiration and controversy for decades. New Deal liberalism lay the foundation of a new consensus. Between 1940 and 1980, there was the liberal consensus about the prospects for the widespread distribution of prosperity within an expanding capitalist economy. Especially Harry S. Truman's Fair Deal and in the 1960s Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society used the New Deal as inspiration for a dramatic expansion of liberal programs. The New Deal's enduring appeal on voters fostered its acceptance by moderate and liberal Republicans. As the first Republican president elected after Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953–1961) built on the New Deal in a manner that embodied his thoughts on efficiency and cost-effectiveness. He sanctioned a major expansion of Social Security by a self-financed program. He supported such New Deal programs as the minimum wage and public housing—he greatly expanded federal aid to education and built the Interstate Highway system primarily as defense programs (rather than jobs program). In a private letter, Eisenhower wrote: In 1964, Barry Goldwater, an unreconstructed anti-New Dealer, was the Republican presidential candidate on a platform that attacked the New Deal. The Democrats under Lyndon B. Johnson won a massive landslide and Johnson's Great Society programs extended the New Deal. However, the supporters of Goldwater formed the New Right which helped to bring Ronald Reagan into the White House in the 1980 presidential election. Once an ardent supporter of the New Deal, Reagan turned against it, now viewing government as the problem rather than solution and, as president, moved the nation away from the New Deal model of government activism, shifting greater emphasis to the private sector. A 2017 review study of the existing literature in the Journal of Economic Literature summarized the findings of the research as follows: > The studies find that public works and relief spending had state income > multipliers of around one, increased consumption activity, attracted > internal migration, reduced crime rates, and lowered several types of > mortality.

There is consensus on only a few points, with most commentators favorable toward the CCC and hostile toward the NRA. Consensus historians of the 1950s, such as Richard Hofstadter, according to Lary May: :[B]elieved that the prosperity and apparent class harmony of the post-World War II era reflected a return to the true Americanism rooted in liberal capitalism and the pursuit of individual opportunity that had made fundamental conflicts over resources a thing of the past. They argued that the New Deal was a conservative movement that built a welfare state, guided by experts, that saved rather than transformed liberal capitalism.Lary May, \\"Review,\\" Journal of American History (December 2010) 97#3 p. 765 Liberal historians argue that Roosevelt restored hope and self- respect to tens of millions of desperate people, built labor unions, upgraded the national infrastructure and saved capitalism in his first term when he could have destroyed it and easily nationalized the banks and the railroads. Historians generally agree that apart from building up labor unions, the New Deal did not substantially alter the distribution of power within American capitalism. \\"The New Deal brought about limited change in the nation's power structure\\".Quote from Mary Beth Norton, et al.

The New Deal preserved democracy in the United States in a historic period of uncertainty and crises when in many other countries democracy failed.Mary Beth Norton, Carol Sheriff und David M. Katzman, A People and a Nation: A History of the United States, Volume II: Since 1865, Wadsworth Inc Fulfillment, 2011, , p. 681 The most common arguments can be summarized as follows: : Harmful * The New Deal vastly increased the federal debt (Billington and Ridge) while Keynesians criticize that the federal deficit between 1933 and 1939 averaged only 3.7% which was not enough to offset the reduction in private sector spending during the Great DepressionClemens, Prosperity, Depression and the New Deal: The USA 1890–1954 p. 205 * Fostered bureaucracy and administrative inefficiency (Billington and Ridge) and enlarged the powers of the federal governmentIra Katznelson and Mark Kesselman, The Politics of Power, 1975 * Slowed the growth of civil service reform by multiplying offices outside the merit system (Billington and Ridge) * Infringed upon free business enterprise (Billington and Ridge) * Rescued capitalism when the opportunity was at hand to nationalize banking, railroads and other industries (New Left critique)Paul K. Conkin : Neutral * Stimulated the growth of class consciousness among farmers and workers (Billington and Ridge) * Raised the issue of how far economic regulation could be extended without sacrificing the liberties of the people (Billington and Ridge) : Beneficial * The nation came through its greatest depression without undermining the capitalist system (Billington and Ridge) * Making the capitalist system more beneficial by enacting banking and stock market regulations to avoid abuses and providing greater financial security through, for example the introduction of Social Security or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (David M. Kennedy)as summarized by Clemens, Prosperity, Depression and the New Deal: The USA 1890–1954 p. 219 * Created a better balance among labor, agriculture and industry (Billington and Ridge) * Produced a more equal distribution of wealth (Billington and Ridge) * Help conserve natural resources (Billington and Ridge) * Permanently established the principle that the national government should take action to rehabilitate and preserve America's human resources (Billington and Ridge) ===Fiscal policy=== National debt as gross national product climbs from 20% to 40% under President Herbert Hoover; levels off under Roosevelt; and soars during World War II from Historical States US (1976) Julian Zelizer (2000) has argued that fiscal conservatism was a key component of the New Deal.Julian E. Zelizer, \\"The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal: Fiscal Conservatism and the Roosevelt Administration, 1933–1938,\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly, (2000) 30#2. pp 331+ online A fiscally conservative approach was supported by Wall Street and local investors and most of the business community—mainstream academic economists believed in it as apparently did the majority of the public. Conservative southern Democrats, who favored balanced budgets and opposed new taxes, controlled Congress and its major committees. Even liberal Democrats at the time regarded balanced budgets as essential to economic stability in the long run, although they were more willing to accept short- term deficits. As Zelizer notes, public opinion polls consistently showed public opposition to deficits and debt. Throughout his terms, Roosevelt recruited fiscal conservatives to serve in his administration, most notably Lewis Douglas the Director of Budget in 1933–1934; and Henry Morgenthau Jr., Secretary of the Treasury from 1934 to 1945. They defined policy in terms of budgetary cost and tax burdens rather than needs, rights, obligations, or political benefits. Personally, Roosevelt embraced their fiscal conservatism, but politically he realized that fiscal conservatism enjoyed a strong wide base of support among voters, leading Democrats and businessmen. On the other hand, there was enormous pressure to act and spending money on high visibility work programs with millions of paychecks a week.Zelizer, \\"The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal: Fiscal Conservatism and the Roosevelt Administration, 1933–1938\\" Douglas proved too inflexible and he quit in 1934. Morgenthau made it his highest priority to stay close to Roosevelt, no matter what. Douglas's position, like many of the Old Right, was grounded in a basic distrust of politicians and the deeply ingrained fear that government spending always involved a degree of patronage and corruption that offended his Progressive sense of efficiency. The Economy Act of 1933, passed early in the Hundred Days, was Douglas's great achievement. It reduced federal expenditures by $500 million, to be achieved by reducing veterans' payments and federal salaries. Douglas cut government spending through executive orders that cut the military budget by $125 million, $75 million from the Post Office, $12 million from Commerce, $75 million from government salaries and $100 million from staff layoffs. As Freidel concludes: \\"The economy program was not a minor aberration of the spring of 1933, or a hypocritical concession to delighted conservatives. Rather it was an integral part of Roosevelt's overall New Deal\\".Freidel 1990, p. 96 Revenues were so low that borrowing was necessary (only the richest 3% paid any income tax between 1926 and 1940).U.S. Bureau of the Census. Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1946. p. 321. Douglas therefore hated the relief programs, which he said reduced business confidence, threatened the government's future credit and had the \\"destructive psychological effects of making mendicants of self-respecting American citizens\\".Zelizer, \\"The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal\\" Roosevelt was pulled toward greater spending by Hopkins and Ickes and as the 1936 election approached he decided to gain votes by attacking big business. Morgenthau shifted with Roosevelt, but at all times tried to inject fiscal responsibility—he deeply believed in balanced budgets, stable currency, reduction of the national debt and the need for more private investment. The Wagner Act met Morgenthau's requirement because it strengthened the party's political base and involved no new spending. In contrast to Douglas, Morgenthau accepted Roosevelt's double budget as legitimate—that is a balanced regular budget and an \\"emergency\\" budget for agencies, like the WPA, PWA and CCC, that would be temporary until full recovery was at hand. He fought against the veterans' bonus until Congress finally overrode Roosevelt's veto and gave out $2.2 billion in 1936. His biggest success was the new Social Security program as he managed to reverse the proposals to fund it from general revenue and insisted it be funded by new taxes on employees. It was Morgenthau who insisted on excluding farm workers and domestic servants from Social Security because workers outside industry would not be paying their way.Zelizer, \\"The Forgotten Legacy of the New Deal: Fiscal Conservatism; Savage 1998 ===Race and gender=== African Americans While many Americans suffered economically during the Great Depression, African Americans also had to deal with social ills, such as racism, discrimination and segregation. Black workers were especially vulnerable to the economic downturn since most of them worked the most marginal jobs such as unskilled or service- oriented work, therefore they were the first to be discharged and additionally many employers preferred white workers. When jobs were scarce some employers even dismissed black workers to create jobs for white citizens. In the end there were three times more African American workers on public assistance or relief than white workers.Hamilton Cravens, Great Depression: People and Perspectives, ABC-CLIO, 2009, , p. 106 Roosevelt appointed an unprecedented number of African Americans to second-level positions in his administration—these appointees were collectively called the Black Cabinet. The WPA, NYA and CCC relief programs allocated 10% of their budgets to blacks (who comprised about 10% of the total population, and 20% of the poor). They operated separate all-black units with the same pay and conditions as white units. Some leading white New Dealers, especially Eleanor Roosevelt, Harold Ickes and Aubrey Williams, worked to ensure blacks received at least 10% of welfare assistance payments. However, these benefits were small in comparison to the economic and political advantages that whites received. Most unions excluded blacks from joining and enforcement of anti-discrimination laws in the South was virtually impossible, especially since most blacks worked in hospitality and agricultural sectors.Ira Katznelson, When Affirmative Action was White (2005). The New Deal programs put millions of Americans immediately back to work or at least helped them to survive.Hamilton Cravens, Great Depression: People and Perspectives, ABC-CLIO, 2009, , pp. 105, 108 The programs were not specifically targeted to alleviate the much higher unemployment rate of blacks.Hamilton Cravens, Great Depression: People and Perspectives, ABC-CLIO, 2009, , p. 108. Some aspects of the programs were even unfavorable to blacks. The Agricultural Adjustment Acts for example helped farmers which were predominantly white, but reduced the need of farmers to hire tenant farmers or sharecroppers which were predominantly black. While the AAA stipulated that a farmer had to share the payments with those who worked the land this policy was never enforced.Hamilton Cravens, Great Depression: People and Perspectives, ABC-CLIO, 2009, , p. 113. The Farm Service Agency (FSA), a government relief agency for tenant farmers, created in 1937, made efforts to empower African Americans by appointing them to agency committees in the South. Senator James F. Byrnes of South Carolina raised opposition to the appointments because he stood for white farmers who were threatened by an agency that could organize and empower tenant farmers. Initially, the FSA stood behind their appointments, but after feeling national pressure FSA was forced to release the African Americans from their positions. The goals of the FSA were notoriously liberal and not cohesive with the southern voting elite. Some New Deal measures inadvertently discriminated against harmed blacks. Thousands of blacks were thrown out of work and replaced by whites on jobs where they were paid less than the NRA's wage minimums because some white employers considered the NRA's minimum wage \\"too much money for Negroes\\". By August 1933, blacks called the NRA the \\"Negro Removal Act\\".Philip S. Foner. Organized Labor and the Black Worker, 1619–1981 (New York: International Publishers, 1981), p. 200. An NRA study found that the NIRA put 500,000 African Americans out of work.Bruce Bartlett. Wrong on Race: The Democratic Party's Buried Past. (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2008), Kindle location 2459. However, since blacks felt the sting of the depression's wrath even more severely than whites they welcomed any help. Until 1936 almost all African Americans (and many whites) shifted from the \\"Party of Lincoln\\" to the Democratic Party. This was a sharp realignment from 1932, when most African Americans voted the Republican ticket. New Deal policies helped establish a political alliance between blacks and the Democratic Party that survives into the 21st century.Nancy J. Weiss, Farewell to the Party of Lincoln: Black Politics in the Age of FDR (1983) There was no attempt whatsoever to end segregation, or to increase black rights in the South, and a number of leaders that promoted the New Deal were racist and anti semites. The wartime Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) executive orders that forbade job discrimination against African Americans, women and ethnic groups was a major breakthrough that brought better jobs and pay to millions of minority Americans. Historians usually treat FEPC as part of the war effort and not part of the New Deal itself. =Segregation= The New Deal was racially segregated as blacks and whites rarely worked alongside each other in New Deal programs. The largest relief program by far was the WPA—it operated segregated units, as did its youth affiliate the NYA. Blacks were hired by the WPA as supervisors in the North, but of 10,000 WPA supervisors in the South only 11 were black. Historian Anthony Badger argues that \\"New Deal programs in the South routinely discriminated against blacks and perpetuated segregation\\". In its first few weeks of operation, CCC camps in the North were integrated. By July 1935, practically all the camps in the United States were segregated, and blacks were strictly limited in the supervisory roles they were assigned. Kinker and Smith argue that \\"even the most prominent racial liberals in the New Deal did not dare to criticize Jim Crow\\". Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes was one of the Roosevelt Administration's most prominent supporters of blacks and former president of the Chicago chapter of the NAACP. In 1937, when Senator Josiah Bailey Democrat of North Carolina accused him of trying to break down segregation laws Ickes wrote him to deny that: :I think it is up to the states to work out their social problems if possible, and while I have always been interested in seeing that the Negro has a square deal, I have never dissipated my strength against the particular stone wall of segregation. I believe that wall will crumble when the Negro has brought himself to a high educational and economic status…. Moreover, while there are no segregation laws in the North, there is segregation in fact and we might as well recognize this.Harold Ickes, The secret diary of Harold L. Ickes Vol. 2: The inside struggle, 1936–1939 (1954) p. 115 The New Deal's record came under attack by New Left historians in the 1960s for its pusillanimity in not attacking capitalism more vigorously, nor helping blacks achieve equality. The critics emphasize the absence of a philosophy of reform to explain the failure of New Dealers to attack fundamental social problems. They demonstrate the New Deal's commitment to save capitalism and its refusal to strip away private property. They detect a remoteness from the people and indifference to participatory democracy and call instead for more emphasis on conflict and exploitation. Women and the New Deal Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA) camp for unemployed women in Maine, 1934 At first, the New Deal created programs primarily for men as it was assumed that the husband was the \\"breadwinner\\" (the provider) and if they had jobs the whole family would benefit. It was the social norm for women to give up jobs when they married—in many states, there were laws that prevented both husband and wife holding regular jobs with the government. So too in the relief world, it was rare for both husband and wife to have a relief job on FERA or the WPA.Children in the family were allowed to hold CCC or NYA jobs—indeed, CCC jobs were normally given to young men whose fathers were on relief. Young women were eligible for NYA jobs which began in 1935. This prevailing social norm of the breadwinner failed to take into account the numerous households headed by women, but it soon became clear that the government needed to help women as well.Susan Ware, Beyond Suffrage: Women in the New Deal (1987) Many women were employed on FERA projects run by the states with federal funds. The first New Deal program to directly assist women was the Works Progress Administration (WPA), begun in 1935. It hired single women, widows, or women with disabled or absent husbands. The WPA employed about 500,000 women and they were assigned mostly to unskilled jobs. 295,000 worked on sewing projects that made 300 million items of clothing and bedding to be given away to families on relief and to hospitals and orphanages. Women also were hired for the WPA's school lunch program.Martha Swain, '\\"The Forgotten Woman': Ellen S. Woodward and Women's Relief in the New Deal\\" Prologue, (1983) 15#4 pp 201–213.Sara B. Marcketti, \\"The Sewing-Room Projects of the Works Progress Administration.\\" Textile History 41.1 (2010): 28–49.Louise Rosenfield Noun, Iowa Women in the WPA (1999) Both men and women were hired for the small but highly publicized arts programs (such as music, theater, and writing). The Social Security program was designed to help retired workers and widows but did not include domestic workers, farmers or farm laborers, the jobs most often held by blacks. However, Social Security was not a relief program and it was not designed for short-term needs, as very few people received benefits before 1942. ===Relief=== Anti-relief protest sign near Davenport, Iowa by Arthur Rothstein, 1940 The New Deal expanded the role of the federal government, particularly to help the poor, the unemployed, youth, the elderly and stranded rural communities. The Hoover administration started the system of funding state relief programs, whereby the states hired people on relief. With the CCC in 1933 and the WPA in 1935, the federal government now became involved in directly hiring people on relief in granting direct relief or benefits. Total federal, state and local spending on relief rose from 3.9% of GNP in 1929 to 6.4% in 1932 and 9.7% in 1934—the return of prosperity in 1944 lowered the rate to 4.1%. In 1935–1940, welfare spending accounted for 49% of the federal, state and local government budgets.Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States (1975) p. 340 series H1 and H2 In his memoirs, Milton Friedman said that the New Deal relief programs were an appropriate response. He and his wife were not on relief, but they were employed by the WPA as statisticians. Friedman said that programs like the CCC and WPA were justified as temporary responses to an emergency. Friedman said that Roosevelt deserved considerable credit for relieving immediate distress and restoring confidence. ===Recovery=== In a survey of economic historians conducted by Robert Whaples, Professor of Economics at Wake Forest University, anonymous questionnaires were sent to members of the Economic History Association. Members were asked to disagree, agree, or agree with provisos with the statement that read: \\"Taken as a whole, government policies of the New Deal served to lengthen and deepen the Great Depression\\". While only 6% of economic historians who worked in the history department of their universities agreed with the statement, 27% of those that work in the economics department agreed. Almost an identical percent of the two groups (21% and 22%) agreed with the statement \\"with provisos\\" (a conditional stipulation) while 74% of those who worked in the history department and 51% in the economic department disagreed with the statement outright. Economic growth and unemployment (1933–1941) WPA employed 2 to 3 million unemployed at unskilled labor From 1933 to 1941, the economy expanded at an average rate of 7.7% per year. Despite high economic growth, unemployment rates fell slowly. { -class=\\"hintergrundfarbe5\\" !style=\\"width:10.5em; text- align:left;\\"Unemployment rate !style=\\"width:4.5em;\\"1933 !style=\\"width:4.5em;\\"1934 !style=\\"width:4.5em;\\"1935 !style=\\"width:4.5em;\\"1936 !style=\\"width:4.5em;\\"1937 !style=\\"width:4.5em;\\"1938 !style=\\"width:4.5em;\\"1939 !style=\\"width:4.5em;\\"1940 !style=\\"width:4.5em;\\"1941 - style=\\"text- align:center; text-align:left;\\"Workers in job creation programs counted as unemployed style=\\"text-align: center;\\"24.9% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"21.7% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"20.1% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"16.9% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"14.3% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"19.0% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"17.2% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"14.6% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"9.9% - style=\\"text-align:center; text-align:left;\\"Workers in job creation programs counted as employed style=\\"text-align: center;\\"20.6% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"16.0% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"14.2% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"9.9% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"9.1% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"12.5% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"11.3% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"9.5% style=\\"text-align: center;\\"8.0% } John Maynard Keynes explained that situation as an underemployment equilibrium where skeptic business prospects prevent companies from hiring new employees. It was seen as a form of cyclical unemployment.David M. Kennedy, Freedom From Fear, The American People in Depression and War 1929–1945, Oxford University Press, 1999, , p. 249 There are different assumptions as well. According to Richard L. Jensen, cyclical unemployment was a grave matter primarily until 1935. Between 1935 and 1941, structural unemployment became the bigger problem. Especially the unions successes in demanding higher wages pushed management into introducing new efficiency-oriented hiring standards. It ended inefficient labor such as child labor, casual unskilled work for subminimum wages and sweatshop conditions. In the long term, the shift to efficiency wages led to high productivity, high wages and a high standard of living, but it necessitated a well-educated, well-trained, hard-working labor force. It was not before war time brought full employment that the supply of unskilled labor (that caused structural unemployment) downsized. Mainstream economics interpretation U.S. GDP annual pattern and long-term trend (1920–1940) in billions of constant dollars =Keynesians: halted the collapse but lacked Keynesian deficit spending= At the beginning of the Great Depression, many economists traditionally argued against deficit spending. The fear was that government spending would \\"crowd out\\" private investment and would thus not have any effect on the economy, a proposition known as the Treasury view, but Keynesian economics rejected that view. They argued that by spending vastly more money—using fiscal policy—the government could provide the needed stimulus through the multiplier effect. Without that stimulus, business simply would not hire more people, especially the low skilled and supposedly \\"untrainable\\" men who had been unemployed for years and lost any job skill they once had. Keynes visited the White House in 1934 to urge President Roosevelt to increase deficit spending. Roosevelt afterwards complained that \\"he left a whole rigmarole of figures – he must be a mathematician rather than a political economist\\".W. Elliot Brownlee, Federal Taxation in America: A Short History (2004) p. 103 The New Deal tried public works, farm subsidies and other devices to reduce unemployment, but Roosevelt never completely gave up trying to balance the budget. Between 1933 and 1941, the average federal budget deficit was 3% per year.Government Spending Chart: United States 1900–2016 – Federal State Local Data. Usgovernmentdebt.us. Retrieved on 2013-07-14. Roosevelt did not fully utilize deficit spending. The effects of federal public works spending were largely offset by Herbert Hoover's large tax increase in 1932, whose full effects for the first time were felt in 1933 and it was undercut by spending cuts, especially the Economy Act. According to Keynesians like Paul Krugman, the New Deal therefore was not as successful in the short run as it was in the long run.New York Times, Paul Krugman, Franklin Delano Obama?, November 10, 2008 Following the Keynesian consensus (that lasted until the 1970s), the traditional view was that federal deficit spending associated with the war brought full-employment output while monetary policy was just aiding the process. In this view, the New Deal did not end the Great Depression, but halted the economic collapse and ameliorated the worst of the crises.Jason Scott Smith, A Concise History of the New Deal, Cambridge University Press, 2014, , p. 2 =Monetarist interpretation= ==Milton Friedman== More influential among economists has been the monetarist interpretation by Milton Friedman as put forth in A Monetary History of the United States, which includes a full-scale monetary history of what he calls the \\"Great Contraction.\\" Friedman concentrated on the failures before 1933 and points out that between 1929 and 1932 the Federal Reserve allowed the money supply to fall by a third which is seen as the major cause that turned a normal recession into a Great Depression. Friedman especially criticized the decisions of Hoover and the Federal Reserve not to save banks going bankrupt. Friedman's arguments got an endorsement from a surprising source when Fed Governor Ben Bernanke made this statement: > Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official > representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and > Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very > sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.Ben S. Bernanke (Nov. 8, > 2002), FederalReserve.gov: Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke Conference to > Honor Milton Friedman, University of Chicago > — Ben S. Bernanke Monetarists state that the banking and monetary reforms were a necessary and sufficient response to the crises. They reject the approach of Keynesian deficit spending. ==Bernanke and Parkinson: cleared the way for a natural recovery== Ben Bernanke and Martin Parkinson declared in \\"Unemployment, Inflation, and Wages in the American Depression\\" (1989) that \\"the New Deal is better characterized as having cleared the way for a natural recovery (for example, by ending deflation and rehabilitating the financial system) rather than as being the engine of recovery itself\\". =New Keynesian economics: crucial source of recovery= Challenging the traditional view, monetarists and New Keynesians like J. Bradford DeLong, Lawrence Summers and Christina Romer argued that recovery was essentially complete prior to 1942 and that monetary policy was the crucial source of pre-1942 recovery.DeLong, J. Bradford, Lawrence H. Summers, N. Gregory Mankiw, and Christina D. Romer. \\"How does macroeconomic policy affect output?.\\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (1988): 467. The extraordinary growth in money supply beginning in 1933 lowered real interest rates and stimulated investment spending. According to Bernanke, there was also a debt-deflation effect of the depression which was clearly offset by a reflation through the growth in money supply. However, before 1992 scholars did not realize that the New Deal provided for a huge aggregate demand stimulus through a de facto easing of monetary policy. While Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued in A Monetary History of the United States (1963) that the Federal Reserve System had made no attempt to increase the quantity in high-powered money and thus failed to foster recovery, they somehow did not investigate the impact of the monetary policy of the New Deal. In 1992, Christina Romer explained in \\"What Ended the Great Depression?\\" that the rapid growth in money supply beginning in 1933 can be traced back to a large unsterilized gold inflow to the U.S. which was partly due to political instability in Europe, but to a larger degree to the revaluation of gold through the Gold Reserve Act. The Roosevelt administration had chosen not to sterilize the gold inflow precisely because they hoped that the growth of money supply would stimulate the economy. Replying to DeLong et al. in the Journal of Economic History, J. R. Vernon argues that deficit spending leading up to and during World War II still played a large part in the overall recovery, according to his study \\"half or more of the recovery occurred during 1941 and 1942\\". According to Peter Temin, Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and Christina Romer, the biggest primary impact of the New Deal on the economy and the key to recovery and to end the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. The thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession important economic indicators turned positive just in March 1933 when Roosevelt took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround. Money supply was still falling and short-term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933, people expected a further deflation and recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. However, when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With those expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment just as they were expected to do. Roosevelt's fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led endogenously to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free-fall in 1933 and output would have been 30 percent lower in 1937 than in 1933.Gauti B. Eggertsson, \\"Great Expectations and the End of the Depression\\", American Economic Review 2008, 98:4, 1476–516Christina Romer, \\"The Fiscal Stimulus, Flawed but Valuable\\", The New York Times, October 20, 2012Peter Temin, Lessons from the Great Depression, MIT Press, 1992, , pp. 87–101 Real business-cycle theory: rather harmful Followers of the real business-cycle theory believe that the New Deal caused the depression to persist longer than it would otherwise have. Harold L. Cole and Lee E. Ohanian say Roosevelt's policies prolonged the depression by seven years.FDR's Policies Prolonged Depression by 7 Years, UCLA Economists Calculate, ucla.edu, 8/10/2004 According to their study, the \\"New Deal labor and industrial policies did not lift the economy out of the Depression\\", but that the \\"New Deal policies are an important contributing factor to the persistence of the Great Depression\\". They claim that the New Deal \\"cartelization policies are a key factor behind the weak recovery\\". They say that the \\"abandonment of these policies coincided with the strong economic recovery of the 1940s\\".Cole, Harold L. and Ohanian, Lee E. New Deal Policies and the Persistence of the Great Depression: A General Equilibrium Analysis , 2004. The study by Cole and Ohanian is based on a real business-cycle theory model. The underlying assumptions of this theory are subject to numerous criticisms and the theory is unable to posit any convincing explanations for the initial causes of the Great Depression. Laurence Seidman noted that according to the assumptions of Cole and Ohanian, the labor market clears instantaneously, which leads to the incredible conclusion that the surge in unemployment between 1929 and 1932 (before the New Deal) was in their opinion both optimal and solely based on voluntary unemployment. Additionally, Cole and Ohanian's argument does not count workers employed through New Deal programs. Such programs built or renovated 2,500 hospitals, 45,000 schools, 13,000 parks and playgrounds, 7,800 bridges, of roads, 1,000 airfields and employed 50,000 teachers through programs that rebuilt the country's entire rural school system. ===Reform=== Francis Perkins looks on as Roosevelt signs the National Labor Relations Act The economic reforms were mainly intended to rescue the capitalist system by providing a more rational framework in which it could operate. The banking system was made less vulnerable. The regulation of the stock market and the prevention of some corporate abuses relating to the sale of securities and corporate reporting addressed the worst excesses. Roosevelt allowed trade unions to take their place in labor relations and created the triangular partnership between employers, employees and government. David M. Kennedy wrote that \\"the achievements of the New Deal years surely played a role in determining the degree and the duration of the postwar prosperity\\".David M. Kennedy, Freedom From Fear, The American People in Depression and War 1929–1945 (Oxford University Press, 1999) p. 363 Paul Krugman stated that the institutions built by the New Deal remain the bedrock of the United States economic stability. Against the background of the 2007–2012 global financial crisis, he explained that the financial crises would have been much worse if the New Deals Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had not insured most bank deposits and older Americans would have felt much more insecure without Social Security. Economist Milton Friedman after 1960 attacked Social Security from a free market view stating that it had created welfare dependency. The New Deal banking reform has weakened since the 1980s. The repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 allowed the shadow banking system to grow rapidly. Since it was neither regulated nor covered by a financial safety net, the shadow banking system was central to the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the subsequent Great Recession.Nicholas Crafts, Peter Fearon, The Great Depression of the 1930s: Lessons for Today, Oxford University Press, 2013, , p. 202 ===Impact on federal government and states=== While it is essentially consensus among historians and academics that the New Deal brought about a large increase in the power of the federal government, there has been some scholarly debate concerning the results of this federal expansion. Historians like Arthur M. Schlesinger and James T. Patterson have argued that the augmentation of the federal government exacerbated tensions between the federal and state governments. However, contemporaries such as Ira Katznelson have suggested that due to certain conditions on the allocation of federal funds, namely that the individual states get to control them, the federal government managed to avoid any tension with states over their rights. This is a prominent debate concerning the historiography of federalism in the United States and—as Schlesinger and Patterson have observed—the New Deal marked an era when the federal-state power balance shifted further in favor of the federal government, which heightened tensions between the two levels of government in the United States. Ira Katznelson has argued that although the federal government expanded its power and began providing welfare benefits on a scale previously unknown in the United States, it often allowed individual states to control the allocation of the funds provided for such welfare. This meant that the states controlled who had access to these funds, which in turn meant many Southern states were able to racially segregate—or in some cases, like a number of counties in Georgia, completely exclude African-Americans—the allocation of federal funds. This enabled these states to continue to relatively exercise their rights and also to preserve the institutionalization of the racist order of their societies. While Katznelson has conceded that the expansion of the federal government had the potential to lead to federal-state tension, he has argued it was avoided as these states managed to retain some control. As Katznelson has observed, \\"they [state governments in the South] had to manage the strain that potentially might be placed on local practices by investing authority in federal bureaucracies [...]. To guard against this outcome, the key mechanism deployed was a separation of the source of funding from decisions about how to spend the new monies\\". However, Schlesinger has disputed Katznelson's claim and has argued that the increase in the power of the federal government was perceived to come at the cost of states' rights, thereby aggravating state governments, which exacerbated federal-state tensions. Schlesinger has utilized quotes from the time to highlight this point and has observed that \\"the actions of the New Deal, [Ogden L.] Mills said, \\"abolish the sovereignty of the States. They make of a government of limited powers one of unlimited authority over the lives of us all\\". Moreover, Schlesinger has argued that this federal-state tension was not a one-way street and that the federal government became just as aggravated with the state governments as they did with it. State governments were often guilty of inhibiting or delaying federal policies. Whether through intentional methods, like sabotage, or unintentional ones, like simple administrative overload—either way, these problems aggravated the federal government and thus heightened federal-state tensions. Schlesinger has also noted that \\"students of public administration have never taken sufficient account of the capacity of lower levels of government to sabotage or defy even a masterful President\\". James T. Patterson has reiterated this argument, though he observes that this increased tension can be accounted for not just from a political perspective, but from an economic one too. Patterson has argued that the tension between the federal and state governments at least partly also resulted from the economic strain under which the states had been put by the federal government's various policies and agencies. Some states were either simply unable to cope with the federal government's demand and thus refused to work with them, or admonished the economic restraints and actively decided to sabotage federal policies. This was demonstrated, Patterson has noted, with the handling of federal relief money by Ohio governor, Martin L. Davey. The case in Ohio became so detrimental to the federal government that Harry Hopkins, supervisor of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, had to federalize Ohio relief. Although this argument differs somewhat from Schlesinger's, the source of federal-state tension remained the growth of the federal government. As Patterson has asserted, \\"though the record of the FERA was remarkably good—almost revolutionary—in these respects it was inevitable, given the financial requirements imposed on deficit-ridden states, that friction would develop between governors and federal officials\\". In this dispute, it can be inferred that Katznelson and Schlesinger and Patterson have only disagreed on their inference of the historical evidence. While both parties have agreed that the federal government expanded and even that states had a degree of control over the allocation of federal funds, they have disputed the consequences of these claims. Katznelson has asserted that it created mutual acquiescence between the levels of government, while Schlesinger and Patterson have suggested that it provoked contempt for the state governments on the part of the federal government and vice versa, thus exacerbating their relations. In short, irrespective of the interpretation this era marked an important time in the historiography of federalism and also nevertheless provided some narrative on the legacy of federal-state relations. ==ChargesCharges of fascism=== Worldwide, the Great Depression had the most profound impact in Germany and the United States. In both countries the pressure to reform and the perception of the economic crisis were strikingly similar. When Hitler came to power he was faced with exactly the same task that faced Roosevelt, overcoming mass unemployment and the global Depression. The political responses to the crises were essentially different: while American democracy remained strong, Germany replaced democracy with fascism, a Nazi dictatorship.Kiran Klaus Patel, Soldiers of Labor: Labor Service in Nazi Germany and New Deal America, 1933–1945 Cambridge University Press 2005, pp. 3–5 The initial perception of the New Deal was mixed. On the one hand, the eyes of the world were upon the United States because many American and European democrats saw in Roosevelt's reform program a positive counterweight to the seductive powers of the two great alternative systems, communism and fascism.Kiran Klaus Patel, Soldiers of Labor: Labor Service in Nazi Germany and New Deal America, 1933–1945, , Cambridge University Press 2005, p. 6 As the historian Isaiah Berlin wrote in 1955: \\"The only light in the darkness was the administration of Mr. Roosevelt and the New Deal in the United States\\". By contrast, enemies of the New Deal sometimes called it \\"fascist\\", but they meant very different things. Communists denounced the New Deal in 1933 and 1934 as fascist in the sense that it was under the control of big business. They dropped that line of thought when Stalin switched to the \\"Popular Front\\" plan of cooperation with liberals. In 1934, Roosevelt defended himself against those critics in a \\"fireside chat\\": > [Some] will try to give you new and strange names for what we are doing. > Sometimes they will call it 'Fascism', sometimes 'Communism', sometimes > 'Regimentation', sometimes 'Socialism'. But, in so doing, they are trying to > make very complex and theoretical something that is really very simple and > very practical.... Plausible self-seekers and theoretical die-hards will > tell you of the loss of individual liberty. Answer this question out of the > facts of your own life. Have you lost any of your rights or liberty or > constitutional freedom of action and choice? After 1945, only few observers continued to see similarities and later on some scholars such as Kiran Klaus Patel, Heinrich August Winkler and John Garraty came to the conclusion that comparisons of the alternative systems do not have to end in an apology for Nazism since comparisons rely on the examination of both similarities and differences. Their preliminary studies on the origins of the fascist dictatorships and the American (reformed) democracy came to the conclusion that besides essential differences \\"the crises led to a limited degree of convergence\\" on the level of economic and social policy. The most important cause was the growth of state interventionism since in the face of the catastrophic economic situation both societies no longer counted on the power of the market to heal itself.Kiran Klaus Patel, Soldiers of Labor: Labor Service in Nazi Germany and New Deal America, 1933–1945, , Cambridge University Press 2005, pp. 5, 6 John Garraty wrote that the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was based on economic experiments in Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, without establishing a totalitarian dictatorship.Garraty, John A. The American Nation: A History of the United States Since 1865. New York: Harper & Row, Publishers (1979), p. 656 . Contrary to that, historians such as Hawley have examined the origins of the NRA in detail, showing the main inspiration came from Senators Hugo Black and Robert F. Wagner and from American business leaders such as the Chamber of Commerce. The model for the NRA was Woodrow Wilson's War Industries Board, in which Johnson had been involved too.Ellis Hawley, The New Deal and the Problem of Monopoly, Princeton University Press, 1966, , p. 23 Historians argue that direct comparisons between Fascism and New Deal are invalid since there is no distinctive form of fascist economic organization.Daniel Woodley, Fascism and Political Theory: Critical Perspectives on Fascist Ideology, Routledge Chapman & Hall, 2010, , pp. 160, 161 Gerald Feldman wrote that fascism has not contributed anything to economic thought and had no original vision of a new economic order replacing capitalism. His argument correlates with Mason's that economic factors alone are an insufficient approach to understand fascism and that decisions taken by fascists in power cannot be explained within a logical economic framework. In economic terms, both ideas were within the general tendency of the 1930s to intervene in the free market capitalist economy, at the price of its laissez- faire character, \\"to protect the capitalist structure endangered by endogenous crises tendencies and processes of impaired self-regulation\\". Stanley Payne, a historian of fascism, examined possible fascist influences in the United States by looking at the KKK and its offshoots and movements led by Father Coughlin and Huey Long. He concluded that \\"the various populist, nativist, and rightist movements in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s fell distinctly short of fascism\\". According to Kevin Passmore, lecturer in History at Cardiff University, the failure of fascism in the United States was due to the social policies of the New Deal that channelled anti-establishment populism into the left rather than the extreme right.Kevin Passmore, Fascism: A Very Short Introduction, Chapter 6, Oxford University Press, 2002 ===Charges of conservatism=== The New Deal was generally held in very high regard in scholarship and textbooks. That changed in the 1960s when New Left historians began a revisionist critique calling the New Deal a bandaid for a patient that needed radical surgery to reform capitalism, put private property in its place and lift up workers, women and minorities.For a list of relevant works, see the list of suggested readings appearing toward the bottom of the article. The New Left believed in participatory democracy and therefore rejected the autocratic machine politics typical of the big city Democratic organizations. In a 1968 essay, Barton J. Bernstein compiled a chronicle of missed opportunities and inadequate responses to problems. The New Deal may have saved capitalism from itself, Bernstein charged, but it had failed to help—and in many cases actually harmed—those groups most in need of assistance. In The New Deal (1967), Paul K. Conkin similarly chastised the government of the 1930s for its weak policies toward marginal farmers, for its failure to institute sufficiently progressive tax reform, and its excessive generosity toward select business interests. In 1966, Howard Zinn criticized the New Deal for working actively to actually preserve the worst evils of capitalism. By the 1970s, liberal historians were responding with a defense of the New Deal based on numerous local and microscopic studies. Praise increasingly focused on Eleanor Roosevelt, seen as a more appropriate crusading reformer than her husband. Since then, research on the New Deal has been less interested in the question of whether the New Deal was a \\"conservative\\", \\"liberal\\", or \\"revolutionary\\" phenomenon than in the question of constraints within which it was operating. In a series of articles, political sociologist Theda Skocpol has emphasized the issue of \\"state capacity\\" as an often-crippling constraint. Ambitious reform ideas often failed, she argued, because of the absence of a government bureaucracy with significant strength and expertise to administer them. Other more recent works have stressed the political constraints that the New Deal encountered. Conservative skepticism about the efficacy of government was strong both in Congress and among many citizens. Thus some scholars have stressed that the New Deal was not just a product of its liberal backers, but also a product of the pressures of its conservative opponents. ===Communists in government=== During the New Deal the communists established a network of a dozen or so members working for the government. They were low level and had a minor influence on policies. Harold Ware led the largest group which worked in the Agriculture Adjustment Administration (AAA) until Secretary of Agriculture Wallace got rid of them all in a famous purge in 1935. Ware died in 1935 and some individuals such as Alger Hiss moved to other government jobs. Other communists worked for the National Labor Relations Board, the National Youth Administration, the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theater Project, the Treasury and the Department of State. ==Political metaphor== Since 1933, politicians and pundits have often called for a \\"new deal\\" regarding an object—that is, they demand a completely new, large-scale approach to a project. As Arthur A. Ekirch Jr. (1971) has shown, the New Deal stimulated utopianism in American political and social thought on a wide range of issues. In Canada, Conservative Prime Minister Richard B. Bennett in 1935 proposed a \\"new deal\\" of regulation, taxation and social insurance that was a copy of the American program, but Bennett's proposals were not enacted and he was defeated for reelection in October 1935. In accordance with the rise of the use of U.S. political phraseology in Britain, the Labour government of Tony Blair termed some of its employment programs \\"new deal\\", in contrast to the Conservative Party's promise of the \\"British Dream\\". ==Works of art and music== The federal government commissioned a series of public murals from the artists it employed: William Gropper's Construction of a Dam (1939) is characteristic of much of the art of the 1930s, with workers seen in heroic poses, laboring in unison to complete a great public project The Works Progress Administration subsidized artists, musicians, painters and writers on relief with a group of projects called Federal One. While the WPA program was by far the most widespread, it was preceded by three programs administered by the US Treasury which hired commercial artists at usual commissions to add murals and sculptures to federal buildings. The first of these efforts was the short-lived Public Works of Art Project, organized by Edward Bruce, an American businessman and artist. Bruce also led the Treasury Department's Section of Painting and Sculpture (later renamed the Section of Fine Arts) and the Treasury Relief Art Project (TRAP). The Resettlement Administration (RA) and Farm Security Administration (FSA) had major photography programs. The New Deal arts programs emphasized regionalism, social realism, class conflict, proletarian interpretations and audience participation. The unstoppable collective powers of common man, contrasted to the failure of individualism, was a favorite theme.Mathews 1975William E. Leuchtenbrg. The FDR Years: On Roosevelt and his Legacy (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995), 243. \\"Created Equal\\": Act I, Scene 3 of Spirit of 1776, Boston (Federal Theatre Project, 1935) Post Office murals and other public art, painted by artists in this time, can still be found at many locations around the U.S.M.J.Heale. Franklin. D. Roosevelt: The New Deal and War (London, 1999)36 The New Deal particularly helped American novelists. For journalists and the novelists who wrote non-fiction, the agencies and programs that the New Deal provided, allowed these writers to describe what they really saw around the country.John Braeman, Robert H. Bremner, David Brody. The New Deal: The National Level (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1975) 310. Many writers chose to write about the New Deal and whether they were for or against it and if it was helping the country out. Some of these writers were Ruth McKenney, Edmund Wilson and Scott Fitzgerald.John Braeman, Robert H. Bremner, David Brody. The New Deal: The National Level (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1975) 312. Another subject that was very popular for novelists was the condition of labor. They ranged from subjects on social protest to strikes.John Braeman, Robert H. Bremner, David Brody. The New Deal: The National Level (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1975) 314. Under the WPA, the Federal Theatre project flourished. Countless theatre productions around the country were staged. This allowed thousands of actors and directors to be employed, among them were Orson Welles, and John Huston. The FSA photography project is most responsible for creating the image of the Depression in the U.S. Many of the images appeared in popular magazines. The photographers were under instruction from Washington as to what overall impression the New Deal wanted to give out. Director Roy Stryker's agenda focused on his faith in social engineering, the poor conditions among cotton tenant farmers and the very poor conditions among migrant farm workers—above all he was committed to social reform through New Deal intervention in people's lives. Stryker demanded photographs that \\"related people to the land and vice versa\\" because these photographs reinforced the RA's position that poverty could be controlled by \\"changing land practices\\". Though Stryker did not dictate to his photographers how they should compose the shots, he did send them lists of desirable themes, such as \\"church\\", \\"court day\\", \\"barns\\".Cara A. Finnegan. Picturing Poverty: Print Culture and FSA Photographs (Smithsonian Books, 2003) pp. 43–44 Films of the late New Deal era such as Citizen Kane (1941) ridiculed so-called \\"great men\\" while the heroism of the common man appeared in numerous movies, such as The Grapes of Wrath (1940). Thus in Frank Capra's famous films, including Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939), Meet John Doe (1941) and It's a Wonderful Life (1946), the common people come together to battle and overcome villains who are corrupt politicians controlled by very rich, greedy capitalists.Harry M. Benshoff, Sean Griffin, America on film: representing race, class, gender, and sexuality at the movies (2003) pp. 172–74 By contrast, there was also a smaller but influential stream of anti–New Deal art. Gutzon Borglum's sculptures on Mount Rushmore emphasized great men in history (his designs had the approval of Calvin Coolidge). Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway disliked the New Deal and celebrated the autonomy of perfected written work as opposed to the New Deal idea of writing as performative labor. The Southern Agrarians celebrated premodern regionalism and opposed the TVA as a modernizing, disruptive force. Cass Gilbert, a conservative who believed architecture should reflect historic traditions and the established social order, designed the new Supreme Court building (1935). Its classical lines and small size contrasted sharply with the gargantuan modernistic federal buildings going up in the Washington Mall that he detested. Hollywood managed to synthesize liberal and conservative streams as in Busby Berkeley's Gold Digger musicals, where the storylines exalt individual autonomy while the spectacular musical numbers show abstract populations of interchangeable dancers securely contained within patterns beyond their control.Szalay 2000 ==New Deal programs== The New Deal had many programs and new agencies, most of which were universally known by their initials. Most were abolished during World War II while others remain in operation today or formed into different programs. They included the following: * National Youth Administration (NYA), 1935: program that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25. Ended in 1943. * Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC): a Hoover agency expanded under Jesse Holman Jones to make large loans to big business. Ended in 1954. The WPA hired unemployed teachers to provide free adult education programs * Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA): a Hoover program to create unskilled jobs for relief; expanded by Roosevelt and Harry Hopkins; replaced by WPA in 1935. * United States bank holiday, 1933: closed all banks until they became certified by federal reviewers. * Abandonment of gold standard, 1933: gold reserves no longer backed currency; still exists. * Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), 1933–1942: employed young men to perform unskilled work in rural areas; under United States Army supervision; separate program for Native Americans. * Homeowners Loan Corporation (HOLC): helped people keep their homes, the government bought properties from the bank allowing people to pay the government instead of the banks in installments they could afford, keeping people in their homes and banks afloat. * Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), 1933: effort to modernize very poor region (most of Tennessee), centered on dams that generated electricity on the Tennessee River; still exists. * Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA), 1933: raised farm prices by cutting total farm output of major crops and livestock; replaced by a new AAA because the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional. * National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), 1933: industries set up codes to reduce unfair competition, raise wages and prices; ended 1935. The Supreme Court ruled the NIRA unconstitutional. * Public Works Administration (PWA), 1933: built large public works projects; used private contractors (did not directly hire unemployed). Ended 1938. * Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC): insures bank deposits and supervises state banks; still exists. * Glass–Steagall Act: regulates investment banking; repealed 1999 (not repealed, only two provisions changed). * Securities Act of 1933, created the SEC, 1933: codified standards for sale and purchase of stock, required awareness of investments to be accurately disclosed; still exists.FERA camp for unemployed black women, Atlanta, 1934 * Civil Works Administration (CWA), 1933–1934: provided temporary jobs to millions of unemployed. * Indian Reorganization Act, 1934: moved away from assimilation; policy dropped. * Social Security Act (SSA), 1935: provided financial assistance to: elderly, handicapped, paid for by employee and employer payroll contributions; required 7 years contributions, so first payouts were in 1942; still exists. * Works Progress Administration (WPA), 1935: a national labor program for more than 2 million unemployed; created useful construction work for unskilled men; also sewing projects for women and arts projects for unemployed artists, musicians and writers; ended 1943. * National Labor Relations Act (NLRA); Wagner Act, 1935: set up the National Labor Relations Board to supervise labor-management relations. In the 1930s, it strongly favored labor unions. Modified by the Taft-Hartley Act (1947); still exists. * Judicial Reorganization Bill, 1937: gave the President power to appoint a new Supreme Court judge for every judge 70 years or older; failed to pass Congress. * Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC), 1938: insures crops and livestock against loss of production or revenue. Was restructured during the creation of the Risk Management Agency in 1996 but continues to exist. * Surplus Commodities Program (1936): gives away food to the poor; still exists as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. * Fair Labor Standards Act 1938: established a maximum normal work week of 44 hours and a minimum wage of 40 cents/hour and outlawed most forms of child labor, though it still exists.The working hours have been lowered to 40 over the years, and the minimum wage has climbed to $7.25. Surplus Commodities Program, 1936 * Rural Electrification Administration (REA): one of the federal executive departments of the United States government charged with providing public utilities (electricity, telephone, water, sewer) to rural areas in the U.S. via public-private partnerships. still exists. * Resettlement Administration (RA): resettled poor tenant farmers; replaced by Farm Security Administration in 1935. * Farm Security Administration (FSA): helped poor farmers by a variety of economic and educational programs; some programs still exist as part of the Farmers Home Administration. ==StatisticsDepression statistics=== \\"Most indexes worsened until the summer of 1932, which may be called the low point of the depression economically and psychologically\\".Mitchell, p. 404. Economic indicators show the American economy reached nadir in summer 1932 to February 1933, then began recovering until the recession of 1937–1938. Thus the Federal Reserve Industrial Production Index hit its low of 52.8 on July 1, 1932 and was practically unchanged at 54.3 on March 1, 1933, but by July 1, 1933 it reached 85.5 (with 1935–39 = 100 and for comparison 2005 = 1,342). In Roosevelt's 12 years in office, the economy had an 8.5% compound annual growth of GDP,Historical Statistics of the United States (1976) series F31 the highest growth rate in the history of any industrial country,Angus Maddison, The World Economy: Historical Statistics (OECD 2003); Japan is close, see p. 174 but recovery was slow and by 1939 the gross domestic product (GDP) per adult was still 27% below trend. { + Table 1: StatisticsU.S. Dept of Commerce, National Income and Product Accounts Real GDP and GNP; Mitchell 446, 449, 451; Consumer Price Index AND M2 Money Supply: 1800–2003 ! !1929 !1931 !1933 !1937 !1938 !1940 - Real Gross National Product (GNP) (1) align=\\"right\\"101.4 align=\\"right\\"84.3 align=\\"right\\"68.3 align=\\"right\\"103.9 align=\\"right\\"96.7 align=\\"right\\"113.0 - Consumer Price Index (2) align=\\"right\\"122.5 align=\\"right\\"108.7 align=\\"right\\"92.4 align=\\"right\\"102.7 align=\\"right\\"99.4 align=\\"right\\"100.2 - Index of Industrial Production (2) align=\\"right\\"109 align=\\"right\\"75 align=\\"right\\"69 align=\\"right\\"112 align=\\"right\\"89 align=\\"right\\"126 - Money Supply M2 ($ billions) align=\\"right\\"46.6 align=\\"right\\"42.7 align=\\"right\\"32.2 align=\\"right\\"45.7 align=\\"right\\"49.3 align=\\"right\\"55.2 - Exports ($ billions) align=\\"right\\"5.24 align=\\"right\\"2.42 align=\\"right\\"1.67 align=\\"right\\"3.35 align=\\"right\\"3.18 align=\\"right\\"4.02 - Unemployment (% of civilian work force) align=\\"right\\"3.1 align=\\"right\\"16.1 align=\\"right\\"25.2 align=\\"right\\"13.8 align=\\"right\\"16.5 align=\\"right\\"13.9 } * (1) in 1929 dollars * (2) 1935–1939 = 100 { + Table 2: Unemployment (% labor force) !Year !Lebergott !Darby - 1933 align=\\"right\\"24.9 align=\\"right\\"20.6 - 1934 align=\\"right\\"21.7 align=\\"right\\"16.0 - 1935 align=\\"right\\"20.1 align=\\"right\\"14.2 - 1936 align=\\"right\\"16.9 align=\\"right\\"9.9 - 1937 align=\\"right\\"14.3 align=\\"right\\"9.1 - 1938 align=\\"right\\"19.0 align=\\"right\\"12.5 - 1939 align=\\"right\\"17.2 align=\\"right\\"11.3 - 1940 align=\\"right\\"14.6 align=\\"right\\"9.5 - 1941 align=\\"right\\"9.9 align=\\"right\\"8.0 - 1942 align=\\"right\\"4.7 align=\\"right\\"4.7 - 1943 align=\\"right\\"1.9 align=\\"right\\"1.9 - 1944 align=\\"right\\"1.2 align=\\"right\\"1.2 - 1945 align=\\"right\\"1.9 align=\\"right\\"1.9 } * Darby counts WPA workers as employed; Lebergott as unemployed * Source: Historical Statistics US (1976) series D-86; Smiley 1983 ===Relief statistics=== { + Families on relief 1936–1941 Relief cases 1936–1941 (monthly average in 1,000)  !1936 !1937 !1938 !1939 !1940 !1941 - colspan=\\"7\\"Workers employed: - WPA align=\\"right\\"1,995 align=\\"right\\"2,227 align=\\"right\\"1,932 align=\\"right\\"2,911 align=\\"right\\"1,971 align=\\"right\\"1,638 - CCC and NYA align=\\"right\\"712 align=\\"right\\"801 align=\\"right\\"643 align=\\"right\\"793 align=\\"right\\"877 align=\\"right\\"919 - Other federal work projects align=\\"right\\"554 align=\\"right\\"663 align=\\"right\\"452 align=\\"right\\"488 align=\\"right\\"468 align=\\"right\\"681 - colspan=\\"7\\"Public assistance cases: - Social security programs align=\\"right\\"602 align=\\"right\\"1,306 align=\\"right\\"1,852 align=\\"right\\"2,132 align=\\"right\\"2,308 align=\\"right\\"2,517 - General relief align=\\"right\\"2,946 align=\\"right\\"1,484 align=\\"right\\"1,611 align=\\"right\\"1,647 align=\\"right\\"1,570 align=\\"right\\"1,206 - Total families helped align=\\"right\\"5,886 align=\\"right\\"5,660 align=\\"right\\"5,474 align=\\"right\\"6,751 align=\\"right\\"5,860 align=\\"right\\"5,167 - Unemployed workers (Bur Lab Stat) align=\\"right\\"9,030 align=\\"right\\"7,700 align=\\"right\\"10,390 align=\\"right\\"9,480 align=\\"right\\"8,120 align=\\"right\\"5,560 - Coverage (cases/unemployed) align=\\"right\\"65% align=\\"right\\"74% align=\\"right\\"53% align=\\"right\\"71% align=\\"right\\"72% align=\\"right\\"93% } ==See also== * Arthurdale, West Virginia, New Deal planned community * Liberalism in the United States * Living New Deal, a research project about the impact of the New Deal * Presidency of Franklin D.

Dasu convinces Ayan not to commit suicide at the heat of the moment when Ayan still insists to die Dasu sorts out a peculiar contract between themselves. He begs Ayan to die exactly after three months. This is because Dasu, who is a part-time insurance agent, wants Ayan to buy a life insurance policy which would mature after three months. Dasu, meanwhile would pay the premium of 10 thousand rupees by any means whatsoever and after three months when Ayan would commit suicide Dasu would get the entire value of the insurance policy (Rs. 10 lacs) as Ayan's only nominee.

It was a ballot proposition and bond measure that allocated funds for the California High-Speed Rail Authority. It now forms Chapter 20 of the California Streets and Highways Code. ==Background== The proposition was put before voters by the state legislature. It was originally to appear on the 2004 state election ballot, but was delayed to the 2006 state election because of budgetary concerns raised by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. In January 2006, the Governor omitted the initial funds for the project from his $222.6 billion Public Works Bond for the next 10 years. The Governor did include $14.3 million in the 2006-07 budget for the California High-Speed Rail Authority, enough for it to begin some preliminary engineering and detailed study. The proposition was delayed again from 2006 to 2008 to avoid competition with a large infrastructure bond, Proposition 1B, which passed in 2006. The original proposition would have appeared in the 2008 general election as Proposition 1, but the state legislature enacted Assembly Bill 3034, which replaced that measure with an updated proposal called Proposition 1A. The updated measure included an additional funding requirement and oversight. ==Provisions== The law allocates $9.95 billion to the California High-Speed Rail Authority. Of that sum, $9 billion will be used to construct the core segments of the rail line from San Francisco to the Los Angeles area and the rest will be spent on improvements to local railroad systems that will connect locations away from the high-speed rail mainline to the high-speed system. The project also requires federal matching funds, since the $9.95 billion bond covers only part of the estimated cost of the initial core segment. The money will be raised through general obligation bonds that are paid off over a period of 30 years. ==Results== 250px ==Supporters== The following people were listed in the official voter information guide as supporters: * Jim Earp, Executive Director California Alliance for Jobs * Bob Balgenorth, President State Building & Construction Trades Council of California * Lucy Dunn, President Orange County Business Council * Steven B.

Urinals allow the patient who has cognition and movement of their arms to urinate without the help of staff. Urinals can also be used as part of input and output measurement. Generally, patients who are able to are encouraged to walk to the toilet or use a bedside commode as opposed to a urinal. The prolonged use of a urinal has been shown to lead to constipation or trouble urinating. Urinals are most frequently used for male patients, since they are easier to use with male anatomy. While female urinals exist, they are more difficult to use, and the common practice for females is to use a bedpan. Female urinals require a wider opening and must be placed between the legs. For many women, female urinals are more practical in a wheelchair rather than in a bed.

Hurricane Five was the most destructive storm of 1881. It impacted the Georgia coast on August 27 as a Category 2 hurricane and was responsible for a large loss of life. Hurricane Six was a Category 2 hurricane that uprooted trees and demolished several buildings across North Carolina and Virginia in September. The last storm of the year was Tropical Storm Seven.

In Savannah, the lowest pressure recorded was at 9.20 PM that evening. A wind speed of 80 mph was recorded there before the anemometer was destroyed. Landfall coincided with high tide and proved very destructive as several barrier islands were completely submerged by storm surge. The hurricane moved inland, dissipating on August 29 over northwestern Mississippi. 335 people were reported as being killed in Savannah and the total death toll due to the hurricane was put at 700, making the hurricane among the deadliest to strike the United States. ===Hurricane Six=== A hurricane existed north of Hispaniola on September 7\\\\. It moved northwestward, reaching a peak of 100 mph prior to hitting southern North Carolina. The hurricane centre moved northward across the Wilmington- Wrightsville Beach area and then close to Norfolk, Virginia, before turning out to sea. Trees were uprooted and buildings demolished at both Smithville (Southport) and Wilmington. An anemometer at Wilmington indicated wind speeds of 90 mph before it was destroyed. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm over land, bringing heavy, yet beneficial, rain to Washington and other states. It moved out to sea, dissipating near Cape Cod. ===Tropical Storm Seven=== A tropical storm was first seen on September 18 to the northwest of Bermuda.

Early in September, Hurricane Two impacted Cuba, Florida, Georgia and both South and North Carolina. The storm caused flooding and damaged property but is not known to have caused any loss of life. Tropical Storm Three formed in the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall near the Texas/Louisiana border on September 15. Tropical Storm Four formed north of the Bahamas and caused extensive flooding from North Carolina to Massachusetts. It eventually dissipated near Long Island on September 23. A tropical storm developed into a hurricane on September 25 but Hurricane Five remained at sea and did not make landfall. As a Category 4 hurricane, Hurricane Six was the strongest storm of 1882. The storm hit Cuba at that intensity but quickly weakened over the island and hit Florida as a tropical storm. The storm caused some considerable damage in Florida before moving out to sea.

It was last seen on the 25th to the southeast of Newfoundland. ===Hurricane Two=== The Pensacola Hurricane of 1882 A tropical storm was first seen to the north of the Mona Passage on September 2. It moved to the west-northwest, reaching winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) before hitting Cuba. It crossed the island, and turned north in the Gulf of Mexico. The hurricane peaked at 125 mph (205 km/h) before hitting near Pensacola, Florida on September 10. It accelerated over the southeastern United States, crossing central Georgia, the western area of South Carolina and entered North Carolina on September 11. Continuing northward the storm moved offshore at Chesapeake Bay and after reaching the Atlantic Ocean, became extratropical near Nova Scotia. At Pensacola, the hurricane damaged crops, shipping and buildings. In Louisiana, half of the rice crop in Plaquemines Parish was destroyed by flooding. Flooding also occurred at Quarantine, Louisiana. It caused a landslide, and property damage throughout North Carolina but no deaths were reported. ===Tropical Storm Three=== A tropical storm was first observed in the Gulf of Mexico on September 14. Its prior track is unknown, but it moved to the west-northwest, and hit land at the mouth of the Sabine River near the Texas/Louisiana border on September 15. Port Eads, Louisiana recorded winds of 70 mph and a pressure of 29.38 inches. The storm brought a storm surge to Sabine Pass, causing moderate damage, and injured one person. ===Tropical Storm Four=== A tropical storm formed north of the Bahamas on September 21. It moved north into North Carolina, landfalling near Cape Lookout. Near Wares Wharf on the Lower Rappahannock four mills were destroyed. Extensive flooding was reported from North Carolina to Massachusetts. In North Carolina bridges were swept away and railroads badly damaged. The storm moved over the mid-Atlantic coast, bringing heavy rain to Washington D.C. and eleven inches of rain to Philadelphia. The storm passed into Chesapeake Bay before moving out to sea on September 23. It dissipated on the 24th near Long Island. ===Hurricane Five=== On September 24, a tropical storm was first seen off the coast of South Carolina. It moved to the northeast, and reached hurricane strength the next day. The hurricane turned to the east-northeast, and was last seen on September 28 to the southeast of Newfoundland. ===Hurricane Six=== The Cuba Hurricane of 1882 On October 5, a tropical storm formed in the western Caribbean Sea. It drifted northward, and as it approached the coast of Cuba, it rapidly intensified to a 140 mph (230 km/h) major hurricane. It weakened greatly over the island, never recovering while moving northward over the Gulf of Mexico. It made landfall on Florida as a tropical storm with maximum wind speeds of 44 mph at Jacksonville and 56 mph at Cedar Key . The storm caused considerable damage in North Florida to telegraph lines, wharves and small boats. It crossed Florida and went out to sea, dissipating on October 15. Its remnants brought heavy rain to Labrador, and left 140 fatalities in its path. ==See also== *Atlantic hurricane season *Tropical cyclone observation *Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project == References  * 1882 Monthly Weather Review Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines Category:1882 natural disasters ","title":"1882 Atlantic hurricane season"},{"id":"19283641","text":"Helen Zerefos (born 8 November 1937) is an Australian coloratura soprano. Her career has spanned more than 50 years on stage, television, in nightclubs, concerts and recordings. Zerefos was born in Scone, New South Wales to Greek parents, Paul and Katina. Her career was launched in 1961, at a time when musical variety shows were popular on television. She was the first person of Greek heritage to be a regular artist on Australian television. She was a regular member of the Revue 20 headed by Claire Poole. This was a twenty-piece choral ensemble which provided background choruses for Seven Network variety programs such (Digby Wolfe's) Revue '61 and '62), (John Laws') Startime and Studio A hosted firstly by The LeGarde Twins and then by Colin Croft as well as Curtain Call, a late night variety program hosted by Revue 20 member John Wickham-Hall. She played Tuptim in a professional tent production of The King and I and Marion Paroo in The Music Man in January 1966 at Warringah Mall in Brookvale, on Sydney's Northern Beaches. She was also engaged to play Maria in a later production of The Sound of Music along with June Bronhill (Maria in the original Australian tour of the musical) who was to play the Mother Abbess. The project was scheduled to present six musicals, however only three (The King and I, Annie Get Your Gun and The Music Man) were actually produced. The project was abandoned for lack of both audience support and a dwindling capital base. The remaining musicals (Gypsy, Bye Bye Birdie and The Sound of Music) remained unpresented. Zerefos was encouraged to pursue a career in America but her marriage in 1971 and strong family ties kept her in Australia. Zerefos is also a tireless charity worker for the Aging Research Centre at Sydney’s Prince of Wales Hospital. Her father died suddenly in 1981 and her mother never recovered from that shock and soon began to show signs of Alzheimer's disease. Her mother needed constant attention, so Zerefos became her primary carer and she was soon fund-raising to assist research into this illness. Zerefos' husband, Raymond, died in 2002 after a lengthy, debilitating illness. Her extravagant costumes earned her the nickname Helen Fairy Floss. She also made a number of LP recordings. ==Awards== Zerefos won the 2006 Mo Award for Classical/Opera Performer. ==References== Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Australian operatic sopranos Category:Australian people of Greek descent Category:Recipients of the Medal of the Order of Australia ","title":"Helen Zerefos"},{"id":"19283659","text":"Golden Valley High School is a school in the William S.

Demonstrators escalated the protests by seizing natural gas infrastructure and government buildings. Violence between supporters of Morales and opponents resulted in at least 30 deaths. ==Protests begin== On August 19, the eastern departments of Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, Tarija, and Chuquisaca called strikes and protests in opposition to central government plans to divert part of the national direct tax on hydrocarbons towards its Renta Dignidad pension plan. Brief clashes occurred in the Santa Cruz de la Sierra, capital of Santa Cruz, between police and armed youths enforcing the strike. In Tarija protesters seized and occupied government buildings. In response to the unrest Morales ordered the Bolivian Army to protect oil and gas infrastructure in the five departments. The governors of the departments warned on September 3, 2008 that if the government didn't change its course that the protests could lead to a cut-off of natural gas exports to Argentina and Brazil. They also threatened setting up roadblocks in the five departments in addition to road blocks set up on roads leading to Argentina and Paraguay. The governors also demanded government troops withdraw from Trinidad, the capital of Beni department, following clashes between MPs and protesters trying to seize facilities of the National Tax Service in the city. President Morales accused the governors of launching a \\"civil coup\\" against his government. ==Violence escalates== Protesters caused the explosion of a natural gas pipeline on September 10, 2008 according to the head of Bolivia's state energy company. He called the attack a \\"terrorist attack\\" and said it result in 10% cut in exports to Brazil. President Morales sent additional troops to the region following the attack. The next day clashes erupted between supporters and opponents of the government in the northeastern town of Cobija, capital of Pando department, resulting in 20 deaths.Comision de UNASUR para el Esclarecimiento de los Hechos de Pando - UNASUR, November 2008 Morales said his government would be patient with the unrest but warned that \\"patience has its limits, really.\\" A spokesman for Morales said the unrest was opening the way to \\"a sort of civil war.\\" The leader of the national opposition, Jorge Quiroga, accused the central government of organizing militias to retake the city of Cobija. Central government work had also ceased while American Airlines was suspending flights to the airport. Peasant supporters of Morales were also threatening to encircle Santa Cruz. Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez warned that if Morales was overthrown or killed Venezuela would give a \\"green light\\" to conduct military operations in Bolivia. Bolivia's army said it rejected \\"external intervention of any nature\\" in response to Chávez. Morales ruled out the use of force against protesters, calling for talks with opposition leaders. The Governor of Tarija department, Mario Cossío, went to La Paz on September 12, 2008 to hold negotiations representing three other opposition governors who had rejected talks with the central government. Morales said he was open to dialogue not only with the governors but with mayors and different social sectors. Before the meeting Mario Cossio called for dialogue saying \\"The first task is to pacify the country, and we hope to agree with President Morales on that. Our presence has to do with that clear will to lay the foundations and hopefully launch a process of dialogue that ends in a great agreement for national reconciliation.\\" Vice President Álvaro García declared a day of national mourning for 20 people killed in Pando most of whom were pro-Morales farmers shot dead by people the government claims were associated with the opposition. == Pando state of emergency == Bolivian authorities declared a state of emergency in Pando which began at midnight on September 12, 2008. During the state of emergency, constitutional guarantees are suspended, private vehicles without authorization are banned from the streets, groups are not allowed to meet; bars, restaurants and discos must close at midnight, and residents are prohibited from carrying firearms. Morales said martial law was not needed anywhere else in the country. Bolivian President Evo Morales Following the declaration of a state of emergency, Bolivian troops took control of the airport in Pando's capital, Cobija, and prepared to retake the city. Morales accused the governor of Pando of orchestrating \\"a massacre\\" of farmers supporting Morales. Pando Governor Leopoldo Fernández rejected the accusation, saying \\"They've accused me of using hit men, when everyone knows those socialist peasants, those fake peasants, were armed.\\" In a speech in Cochabamba, Morales condemned the opposition governors, saying they were \\"conspiring against us with a fascist, racist coup,\\" and said they were \\"the enemies of all Bolivians.\\" While promising to adopt a constitution opposed by the governors Morales said Bolivia's \\"democratic revolution\\" had to be seen through saying \\"We have always cried 'fatherland or death'. If we don't emerge victorious, we have to die for the country and the Bolivian people.\\" Morales also said he would not hesitate to extend the state of emergency to other opposition-controlled departments. Rubén Costas, the governor of Santa Cruz, belittled the chances of a breakthrough in talks adding that \\"if there is just one more death or person wounded, any possibility of dialogue will be broken.\\" Opposition protest leader and pro-autonomy businessman Branko Marinkovic announced on September 14, 2008 that the demonstrators he led would be removing their road blocks as \\"a sign of good will\\" to allow dialogue to prosper and calling on the government to end \\"repression and genocide in the department of Pando.\\" Troops who had landed at Cobija also began patrolling the streets before dawn and began uncovering more dead bodies from the September 11 clash in Pando between Morales supporters and opposition protesters. Alfredo Rada, government minister for Pando, referring to casualty figures, said \\"We are nearing the 30 mark.\\" An aide to the opposition governor in Pando denied the army was in control of the departmental capital. Troops were also hunting for Pando governor Fernández with orders to arrest him. A spokesman for Morales said blockades remained on the highway and said \\"an armed group\\" had set fire to the town hall in Filadelfia, a municipality near Cobija. The Pando government spokesman said the citizens of Cobija did not want the Army to enter the city, and that they were not going to follow martial law. Bolivia's army arrested as many as 10 people for alleged involvement in the deadly clashes. Leopoldo Fernández was also taken into custody by the armed forces on September 16, to be flown to La Paz to face accusations that he hired hitmen to fire on pro-government supporters. He was charged with committing genocide. The U.S. began evacuating Peace Corps volunteers from Bolivia and organized at least two evacuation flights in response. In spite of the arrest, opposition governors agreed to talks, conditioned on anti-Morales protesters ending occupations of government buildings. Matters up for discussion include the opposition drive for more autonomy for their provinces and a larger share of state energy revenue. Talks were expected to begin on Thursday. The army also professed its support for Morales. Morales appointed Navy Rear Admiral Landelino Bandeiras as the replacement for the governor of Pando September 20, 2008. Difficulties were reported in the peace talks by presidential spokesman Ivan Canelas, who said the position of the opposition governors could hinder peace talks and condemned the \\"lack of political will of these authorities to backup the efforts being made by the central government to preserve peace and national unity.\\" Supporters of Morales have threatened to storm the city of Santa Cruz if the talks should fail. On September 25, 2008, Morales rejected autonomy proposals by the Eastern provinces, putting the talks on hold.http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90852/6506925.html On October 20, 2008, Morales and the opposition agreed to hold the referendum on January 25, 2009 and early elections in December 2009; Morales in turn promised he would not run again in 2014 after his likely reelection in 2009, despite being allowed to do so under the new constitution. == Diplomatic response == Accusing the United States of supporting the opposition governors and attempting to overthrow his government, Morales declared the United States Ambassador to Bolivia Philip Goldberg persona non grata, and ordered him to leave the country. The U.S. responded by expelling Bolivia's ambassador in Washington. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack expressed regret at the diplomatic fallout saying it will \\"prejudice the interests of both countries, undermine the ongoing fight against drug trafficking and will have serious regional implications.\\" President Morales said he does not want to break diplomatic ties with the U.S. but said the actions of the ambassador were \\"very serious\\", claiming he met with provincial leaders and instigated the unrest. Before his departure the American ambassador warned Bolivia that it would face \\"serious consequences\\" and had \\"not correctly evaluated\\" the retaliation from Washington. Venezuela's President Hugo Chávez ordered the U.S. ambassador in Caracas Patrick Duddy to also leave saying it was in part out of solidarity with Bolivia. Chávez also said he was recalling Venezuela's ambassador to the U.S. until a new government takes office. Chávez accused the United States of being involved in the unrest saying \\"The U.S. is behind the plan against Bolivia, behind the terrorism.\\" State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said the expulsions by Bolivia and Venezuela reflect \\"the weakness and desperation of these leaders as they face internal challenges.\\" Morales responded that the act was \\"not of weakness, but of dignity,\\" and was about freeing Bolivia from \\"the American Empire.\\" === Other responses ===  National governments  *: The Foreign Ministry said Brazil's government was taking the necessary measures to guarantee gas supplies in the country. It also expressed \\"grave concern\\" at the unrest in Bolivia deploring the outbreak of violence and attacks on state institutions and public order. Aides to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said high-ranking members of his government and Argentina's were ready to try to negotiate a deal between Morales and his opponents. *: President Rafael Correa said both Bolivia and Venezuela had sufficient reason to expel the U.S. ambassadors saying Ecuador would expel someone if they interfered in his country's internal affairs. *: President Manuel Zelaya put off a ceremony at which the U.S. ambassador would present a letter with his diplomatic credentials \\"in solidarity with Bolivian President Evo Morales.\\" A few days later he told the envoy to present his credentials as ambassador later in the week. *: President Daniel Ortega announced his support for Bolivia's expulsion of the U.S. ambassador. He later rejected an invitation to meet with U.S. President George W. Bush out of \\"solidarity\\" with Morales.  Intergovernmental organizations  *20px Secretary General of the Andean Community of Nations Freddy Ehlers condemned the violence in Bolivia and called for dialogue between the government and opposition. *: In a statement the EU urged \\"all parties to take steps to rapidly establish\\" talks to stop the situation getting worse, offered to mediate between opposing parties, and expressed regret over attacks on aid projects. *: Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \\"rejects the use of violence as a means to advance political ends and joins others, including the Secretary General of the Organization of American States, José Miguel Insulza, and Bolivia's Conference of Catholic Bishops, in calling for dialogue, urgently, to seek consensus on the pressing issues affecting the Bolivian people,\\" according to a statement issued by the UN. * President of Chile and President pro tempore of the Union of South American Nations Michelle Bachelet summoned an emergency meeting of heads of state in Santiago de Chile to analyze the political situation in Bolivia, scheduled for Monday September 15. That meeting ended with backing for the Bolivian leader. On September 24, 2008 Unasur agreed to send a special commission to investigate the violence in Pando. ==See also== *Bolivian gas conflict, 2003–2006 social conflict stemming from issues around gas taxation and nationalization *Bolivian autonomy referendums, 2008 *2019 Bolivian protests *2019 Bolivian political crisis == References == Category:History of Bolivia Category:Protests in Bolivia Unrest In Bolivia, 2008 Unrest In Bolivia, 2008 ","title":"2008 unrest in Bolivia"},{"id":"19283730","text":"Pharmacotoxicology entails the study of the consequences of toxic exposure to pharmaceutical drugs and agents in the health care field. The field of pharmacotoxicology also involves the treatment and prevention of pharmaceutically induced side effects. Pharmacotoxicology can be separated into two different categories: pharmacodynamics (the effects of a drug on an organism), and pharmacokinetics (the effects of the organism on the drug). ==Mechanisms of Pharmaceutical Drug Toxicity== There are many mechanisms by which pharmaceutical drugs can have toxic implications. A very common mechanism is covalent binding of either the drug or its metabolites to specific enzymes or receptor in tissue-specific pathways that then will elicit toxic responses. Covalent binding can occur during both on-target and off- target situations and after biotransformation. ===On-target toxicity.=== On- target toxicity is also referred to as mechanism-based toxicity. This type of adverse effect that results from pharmaceutical drug exposure is commonly due to interactions of the drug with its intended target. In this case, both the therapeutic and toxic targets are the same. To avoid toxicity during treatment, many times the drug needs to be changed to target a different aspect of the illness or symptoms. Statins are an example of a drug class that can have toxic effects at the therapeutic target (HMG CoA reductase). ===Immune Responses=== Some pharmaceuticals can initiate allergic reactions, as in the case of penicillins. In some people, administration of penicillin can induce production of specific antibodies and initiate an immune response. Activation of this response when unwarranted can cause severe health concerns and prevent proper immune system functioning. Immune responses to pharmaceutical exposure can be very common in accidental contamination events. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been shown to alter the humoral adaptive immune response in gilthead seabream. In this case, pharmaceuticals can produce adverse effects not only in humans, but also in organisms that are unintentionally exposed. ===Off-target toxicity=== Adverse effects at targets other than those desired for pharmaceutical treatments often occur with drugs that are nonspecific. If a drug can bind to unexpected proteins, receptors, or enzymes that can alter different pathways other than those desired for treatment, severe downstream effects can develop. An example of this is the drug eplerenone (aldosterone receptor antagonist), which should increase aldosterone levels, but has shown to produce atrophy of the prostate. ===Bioactivation=== Bioactivation is a crucial step in the activity of certain pharmaceuticals. Often, the parent form of the drug is not the active form and it needs to be metabolized in order to produce its therapeutic effects. In other cases, bioactivation is not necessarily needed for drugs to be active and can instead produce reactive intermediates that initiate stronger adverse effects than the original form of the drug. Bioactivation can occur through the action Phase I metabolic enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 or peroxidases. Reactive intermediates can cause a loss of function in some enzymatic pathways or can promote the production of reactive oxygen species, both of which can increase stress levels and alter homeostasis. ===Drug-drug interactions=== Drug-drug interactions can occur when certain drugs are administered at the same time. Effects of this can be additive (outcome is greater than those of one individual drug), less than additive (therapeutic effects are less than those of one individual drug), or functional alterations (one drug changes how another is absorbed, distributed, and metabolized). Drug-drug interactions can be of serious concern for patients who are undergoing multi-drug therapies. Coadministration of chloroquine, an anti-malaria drug, and statins for treatment of cardiovascular diseases has been shown to cause inhibition of organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and lead to systemic statin exposure. ==Pharmacotoxicity Examples== There are many different pharmaceutical drugs that can produce adverse effects after biotransformation, interaction with alternate targets, or through drug-drug interactions. All pharmaceuticals can be toxic, depending on the dose. ===Acetaminophen=== Acetaminophen (APAP) is a very common drug used to treat pain. High doses of acetaminophen has been shown to produce severe hepatotoxicity after being biotransformed to produce reactive intermediates. Acetaminophen is metabolized by CYP2E1 to produce NAPQI, which then causes significant oxidative stress due to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can cause cellular damage in a multitude of ways, a few of which being DNA and mitochondrial damage and depletion of antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione. In terms of drug-drug interactions, acetaminophen activates CAR, a nuclear receptor involved in the production of metabolic enzymes, which increases the metabolism of other drugs. This could either cause reactive intermediates/drug activity to persist for longer than necessary, or the drug will be cleared quicker than normal and prevent any therapeutic actions from occurring. Ethanol induces CYP2E1 enzymes in the liver, which can lead to increased NAPQI formation in addition to that formed by acetaminophen. ===Aspirin=== Aspirin is an NSAID used to treat inflammation and pain. Overdoses or treatments in conjunction with other NSAIDs can produce additive effects, which can lead to increased oxidative stress and ROS activity. Chronic exposure to aspirin can lead to CNS toxicity and eventually affect respiratory function. ===Anti-depressants=== Anti- depressants have been prescribed since the 1950s, and their prevalence has significantly increased since then. There are many classes of anti-depressant pharmaceuticals, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and tricyclic anti-depressants. Many of these drugs, especially the SSRIs, function by blocking the metabolism or reuptake of neurotransmitters to treat depression and anxiety. Chronic exposure or overdose of these pharmaceuticals can lead to seratonin and CNS hyperexcitation, weight changes, and, in severe cases, suicide. ===Anti-cancer drugs=== Doxorubicin is a very effective anti-cancer drug that causes congestive heart failure while treating tumors. Doxorubicin is an uncoupling agent in that it inhibits proper functioning of complex I of the electron transport chain in mitochondria. It then leads to the production of ROS and the inhibition of ATP production. Doxorubicin has been shown to be selectively toxic to cardiac tissue, although some toxicity has been seen in other tissues as well. Other anti-cancer drugs, such as fluoropyrimidines and taxanes, are extremely effective at treating and reducing tumor proliferation, but have high incidences of cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarctions. ==References * PsychRights.org - 'Psychiatric Polypharmacy: A Word of Caution', Leslie Morrison, MS, RN, Esq, Paul B.

Established in 1817 as the Bank of New South Wales, it acquired the Commercial Bank of Australia in 1982 before being renamed shortly afterwards. It is one of Australia's \\"big four\\" banks and is Australia's first and oldest banking institution. Its name is a portmanteau of \\"Western\\" and \\"Pacific\\". As of March 2018, Westpac has 14 million customers, and employs almost 40,000 people. ==History== Westpac Place in Sydney, Westpac's global headquarters Established in Sydney in 1817, the Bank of New South Wales (BNSW) was the first bank in Australia. Edward Smith Hall was its first cashier and secretary. During the 19th and early 20th century, BNSW opened branches first throughout Australia and Oceania: at Moreton Bay (Brisbane) in 1850; in Victoria in 1851; in New Zealand in 1861; in South Australia in 1877; in Western Australia in 1883; in Fiji in 1901; in Papua New Guinea in 1910; and in Tasmania in 1910. *1927: BNSW acquires the Western Australian Bank. *1931: BNSW acquires the Australian Bank of Commerce *1968: BNSW joins the Databank Systems Limited consortium to provide joint data processing services. *1970: BNSW is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange on 18 July 1970. *1973: BNSW becomes the corporate sponsor of the Rescue Helicopter service started by Surf Life Saving Australia. The service is known today as the Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service. *1974: The Bank of New Zealand (20%), BNSW (20%), Bank of Hawaii (20%), and the Government of Tonga (40%) establish the Bank of Tonga as a joint venture. *1975: BNSW incorporates its local business in Papua New Guinea as Bank of New South Wales (PNG). *1977: BNSW forms the Pacific Commercial Bank in Samoa as a joint venture with Bank of Hawaii, buying into Pacific Savings and Loan Company, in which Bank of Hawaii had had an ownership interest since 1971. ===Westpac is formed=== *1982: BNSW merged with the Commercial Bank of Australia and changed their name to Westpac Banking Corporation, with the mission to become a significant Western Pacific bank from which Westpac is derived. The brandname incorporated the \\"W\\" which had been the logo of the Bank of New South Wales (popularly known as \\"the Wales\\"). *1984: The original agreement between BNSW and the government in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands expired and WBC and the government of Kiribati formed Bank of Kiribati as a 51–49% joint venture. Bank of Kiribati also fulfilled the functions of a reserve or central bank. *1985: WBC replaced Barclays Bank in the National Bank of Tuvalu (est. 1981) in Tuvalu (ex-Ellice Islands), taking 40% of the shares as well as a 10-year management contract. *1988: the firm acquired the European Pacific Banking Corporation in the Cook Islands and a HSBC subsidiary, the Solomon Islands Banking Corporation, which HSBC had established as a branch in 1973. WBC also acquired HSBC's operations in Fiji and the New Hebrides, and established a branch in Niue that is the only bank in that country. (HSBC had established its branch in Fiji only some 18 months earlier). *1990: Bank of New Zealand sold half its shares in Bank of Tonga to WBC and half to Bank of Hawaii, giving each of them 30%. WBC bought Banque Indosuez's operations in New Caledonia and Tahiti. (Banque de l'Indochine, which later merged into Banque Indosuez, had established itself in New Caledonia in 1888 and in Papeete, Tahiti in 1905. In both places l'Indochine functioned as the bank of issue until 1966–7.) *1992: WBC recorded a 1.6 billion dollar loss, which at the time, was the largest loss for an Australian corporation. In the process the firm came close to insolvency, and slipped from being Australia's largest to third largest bank. *1995: WBC sold its shares in National Bank of Tuvalu to that country's government, which now wholly owns the bank. *1995: WBC acquired Challenge Bank in Western Australia. *1996: WBC Holdings NZ bought Trust Bank, a chain of regional banks owned by Community Trusts, for NZD1.2 billion to form NZ largest bank, WestpacTrust. The bank had promised to keep the funding to Community Trusts flowing and to keep \\"Trust\\" in its name. However, Community Trust funding slowed to a trickle, and in 2002 the bank launched a rebranding which included dropping the \\"Trust\\" from its name. The merger of WBC and Trustbank also saw the closure of many branches around New Zealand. In towns and cities where both WBC and Trustbank existed, the bank merged redundant branches into a single branch; also it closed many branches in rural areas and outer suburbs. *1996: WBC sold Challenge Bank to the Bank of Melbourne. *1997: it acquired Bank of Melbourne in Victoria, paying an estimated price in excess of A$1.4 billion. WBC retained the rights to the Bank of Melbourne name and logos, but in 2004 rebadged the branches as Westpac. In 2011, Westpac relaunched the brand.Westpac revives Bank of Melbourne: report , Business Spectator 10 March 2011. *1998: it sold its operations in New Caledonia and Tahiti to Société Générale, which merged them with Société Générale Calédonienne de Banque (est. 1971) and Banque de Polynésie (est. 1973), respectively. *2001: The government of Kiribati sought to reduce Westpac's share in Bank of Kiribati from 51 to 49%, leading WBC to sell its shares back to the government. Bank of Hawaii sold its interest in Pacific Commercial Bank (42.7%) to Westpac, which held an equal portion. WBC offered Samoan investors, who held the remaining shares, the same price it had paid Bank of Hawaii. WBC now owns 93.5% of Westpac Bank Samoa and Samoan companies and individuals own 6.5%. In Tonga, Bank of Hawaii sold its shares in Bank of Tonga to Westpac, giving WBC 60% ownership of what is now Westpac Bank of Tonga. *2002: WBC acquired BT Financial Group and Rothschild Australia Asset Management. *2004: The Reserve Bank of New Zealand required WBC to incorporate its NZ branches network. WBC sold its branch in Niue to Bank of South Pacific. *2008: Former St George Bank CEO Gail Kelly appointed chief executive officer and managing director. *2008: WBC announced that it intended to merge with the 5th largest Australian bank, St George Bank, for A$19 billion. The holders of about 95% of St George's shares voted in favour of the merger. *2008: On 17 November, the Federal Court of Australia approved the merger of Westpac and St George. *2011: During July, St George branches in the state of Victoria were rebadged as Bank of Melbourne branches. *In early February 2012, Westpac announced plans to axe more than 400 domestic jobs and another 150 offshore jobs. This action was a response to much slower growth over the past several years and the desire to rationalise following Westpac's 2008 merger with St. George Bank. *In 2014, Brian Hartzer was named CEO of Westpac. *2017: WBC celebrated its 200th anniversary. *2020: In April, Peter King was appointed CEO of Westpac, replacing Brian Hartzer. ==Core business activities== The structure involves five key divisions including: Consumer Bank, Commercial and Business Bank, BT Financial Group, Westpac Institutional Bank and Westpac New Zealand. These five divisions serve more than 13 million customers. ===Consumer Bank=== Consumer Bank is responsible for sales and service of its 9 million consumer customers in Australia, assisting them with their everyday banking needs. The division covers all consumer banking products and services under the Westpac, St George, BankSA, Bank of Melbourne and RAMS brands. Activities are conducted through the Consumer Bank's nationwide network of 1,429 branches, third-party distributors, call centres, 3,850 ATMs, EFTPOS terminals and internet banking services. ===Business Bank=== The Business Bank is responsible for sales and service of its small-to-medium enterprise, commercial and agribusiness customers in Australia, as well as asset and equipment finance and operates under the Westpac, St George Bank, BankSA and Bank of Melbourne brands. Business and corporate customers (businesses with facilities typically up to $150 million) are provided with a wide range of banking and financial products and services, including specialist advice for cash flow finance, trade finance, automotive and equipment finance, property finance, transaction banking and treasury services. Sales and service activities for business and corporate customers are conducted by relationship managers via business banking centres, internet and customer service centre channels. ===BT=== BT is the wealth management brand of the Westpac Group. Funds Management operations include the manufacture and distribution of investment, superannuation products and investment platforms including Panorama, BT Wrap and Asgard. Insurance solutions cover the manufacturing and distribution of life, general and lenders mortgage insurance. ===Westpac Institutional Bank=== Westpac Institutional Bank (WIB) delivers a broad range of financial services to commercial, corporate, institutional and government customers. WIB operates through dedicated industry relationship and specialist product teams, with expert knowledge in transactional banking, financial and debt capital markets, specialised capital, margin lending, broking and alternative investment solutions. Customers are supported through operations in Australia, New Zealand, the US, the UK, and Asian centres. ===Westpac New Zealand=== Westpac NZ's head office in Auckland In 1861 the Bank of New South Wales opened seven branches in New Zealand. Currently, Westpac NZ offers a full-service with around 1.5 million customers, 3,000 shareholders and 197 branches nationwide. It is the dominant provider of banking services to small to medium business, corporate and institutional organisations, and is the banker of the New Zealand government. It currently is the second largest bank in New Zealand, after the merger of ANZ and National Bank of New Zealand. On 29 September 2006 the New Zealand Commerce Commission fined Westpac NZ$5.1 million for hidden foreign transaction fees, with most of the fine being reimbursement to affected customers, in the order of 12% of the fees actually charged. All other banks operating in New Zealand had either already been fined or were awaiting a court case. In October 2009, Westpac NZ was required to pay NZ$961 million to the Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand) in avoided taxes. On 22 July 2014, the firm announced that it would pilot a host card emulation (HCE) mobile payments technology to customers. It was the first bank in New Zealand to actively bring HCE mobile payments to market\\"Westpac trialsTrials HCE Digital Wallet Technology\\" , 22 July 2014. and one of only a handful of banks globally to be using the innovative 'digital wallet' technology. The three- month trial, using Carta Worldwide HCE technology, enabled customers to securely store and access credit and debit card information in a remote and hosted 'cloud' environment, enabling customers to use their Android smartphones as digital wallets. Soon after, in August 2014, Westpac NZ announced that it would be releasing the world's first augmented bank app,\\"Augmented Reality - world first for Westpac customers\\" , 5 August 2014. which adds layers of functionality to the digital wallet by enabling users to check account balances, view previous spending behaviours, pay bills and locate their nearest Westpac NZ branch or ATM. The app is also viewable in a 3D format by supported devices. Naming rights * Westpac Stadium in Wellington * Westpac Halberg Award ===ATM Alliance=== Westpac is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that allows customers of the banks to use their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance with no fees when traveling internationally. Other participating banks are Allied Irish Banks (Ireland), Barclays (in the UK, Spain and parts of Africa), Bank of America (US), BNP Paribas (France), Ukrsibbank (Ukraine), Deutsche Bank (in Germany, Spain, Italy, Poland), and Scotiabank (in Canada, Chile, Mexico among many other countries).\\"Five big banks form Global ATM Alliance\\" , ATMmarketplace.com. 9 January 2002. Accessed 22 June 2007. ===Westpac Migrant Banking=== This unit of both the Australian and New Zealand Bank offers banking facilities to those migrating to either New Zealand or Australia. Bank accounts for migrants can be opened before people arrive in the country, and credit cards and mortgages can be approved before arrival. Westpac Migrant Banking has a representative office in London where accounts can be arranged, although the process can be done remotely from any country. Westpac planned to open a retail branch in London in 2011. ===Westpac Pacific=== Westpac branch in Suva, Fiji Westpac operates in seven south Pacific nations; the unit is headquartered in Sydney. The financial services offered include electronic banking (via online banking, ATMs and EFTPOS), deposit, loan, transaction accounts and international trade facilities to personal and business customers. Westpac Fiji is Westpac's Fijian operation. It is one of the largest banks in the country and has a 40% market share. ===Banking Alliance for Women=== Westpac Pacific Banking is a member of the Global Banking Alliance for Women, supporting initiatives in the Pacific to help women prosper and grow. ===Reinventure=== Westpac has committed $150m to the venture capital group Reinventure with the objective to increase the impact of technology in financial markets. The Westpac-backed firm has invested in start-ups like BrickX, OpenAgent and CodeLingo. Reinventure is mandated to invest independently of Westpac, unlike venture capital strategies led by other Australian banks. ==ControversyManipulation of benchmark interest rates=== In 2016 Westpac was mentioned in a lawsuit by Australian Securities and Investments Commission for manipulation of Australian benchmark interest rates. ===US Federal Reserve borrowings=== In 2009, a Westpac-owned entity secured US$1.09 billion from the US Federal Reserve. Commentary suggests this was an unusual move for the bank, given its relatively minor position in North America. The borrowings by Westpac occurred at the height of the global financial crisis and was part of a Federal Reserve move to stabilise financial markets globally. The public and government attention of the borrowings followed the release of the information by the Federal Reserve in 2011, not Westpac. ===Funding of coal mining in New Zealand=== Westpac has come under criticism from climate-change organisations in New Zealand for its role in funding mining company Bathurst, which has gained resource consent to mine coal on the Denniston Plateau on the West Coast of the South Island. Opponents have claimed that the mine will release up to 218 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, which will worsen the effects of anthropogenic climate change, as well as significantly damage an important ecosystem. Westpac have largely ignored these claims, despite over one hundred customers leaving the company because of this issue. ===Money Laundering and Child Exploitation Scandal=== In November 2019, it was revealed that Westpac was guilty of violating anti-money laundering, child exploitation and counter- terror finance laws. CEO Brian Hartzer resigned in the wake of these. According to the Australian regulators, Westpac had 23 million anti-money laundering law violations. Which is the Australia's biggest ever anti-money laundering scandal to date. On 24 September 2020, Westpac and AUSTRAC agreed to a AUD $1.3 billion dollar penalty over Westpac’s breaches of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 - the largest fine ever issued in Australian corporate history. ==Corporate responsibility== In 2002 Westpac released a social impact report that outlined the bank's plan to meet international standards in the area of corporate social responsibility. This led to Westpac's assessment as the global sustainability leader for the banking sector in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index from 2004 to 2007. Westpac has been criticised for backing logging operations on the Solomon Islands that destroy virgin rainforests. Because of this, the Australian Greens have called for the Banksia Awards to be withdrawn from Westpac. ==See also== * Banking in Australia *Global ATM Alliance *List of banks in Australia * List of banks in Oceania *Westpac House *Westpac Life Saver Rescue Helicopter Service *Westpac Rescue Helicopter (New Zealand) *Westpac Stadium *List of Westpac buildings ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Narube, S. and B.T.

At one time he controlled 13 banks. Known as the \\"Ice King\\" early in his career out of New York City, through Tammany Hall corruption he established a monopoly in New York's ice business, before buying several shipping companies and moving into high finance. His attempt to manipulate the price of copper-shares set off a wave of selling that developed into the Panic of 1907. Jailed for violating federal banking laws, he faked serious illness and was released. Later he was indicted for war profiteering and fraud. ==Early life and education== Morse was born in Bath, Maine, in 1856, the son of Benjamin Wyman and Anna Eliza Jane (Rodbird) Morse.Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. XIII, p. 239. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1934. His father had a large role in the towing business on the Kennebec River. Charles was already involved in the shipping business while a student at Bowdoin College, and at his graduation in 1877 he had accumulated a sizable capital. After college he went into business with his father and a cousin, Harry F. Morse, forming C.W. Morse & Company and engaging in an extensive business shipping ice and lumber.Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. XIII, pp. 239–240. ==Career== As his business interests grew, Morse moved to Boston and, in 1897, New York City. ===The \\"Ice Trust\\"=== He organized the Consolidated Ice Company in 1897 and went into the ice business. In 1899 he merged it with several other companies to form the American Ice Company which, grossly overcapitalized at $60 million, held a virtual monopoly for ice in New York. Morse quickly became known as \\"The Ice King\\".Dictionary of American Biography Vol. XIII, p. 240. At that time commercial ice was cut from frozen rivers, much of it in Morse's native state of Maine. On May 1, 1900, Morse attempted to use his monopoly to raise the price of ice. The plan backfired, however, and it was revealed by the New York Journal and Advertiser that Morse had obtained special privileges from Tammany Hall to run his business, and in exchange Robert Van Wyck (New York City's first mayor over the five united boroughs) had been given a substantial ownership share in the ice companies (by then known as the \\"Ice Trust\\") as had Richard Croker, the boss of Tammany Hall. Having formed a holding company called the Ice Securities Company, Morse manipulated its stock and left the ice business with a profit of some $12 million.Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. XIII, p. 240; Henry F. Pringle, The Life and Times of William Howard Taft, Chapter 33. New York: Farrar & Rinehart, Inc., 1939. === Shipping and banking === On June 18, 1901 he married Clemence Dodge, a divorcee from Atlanta, at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church in Manhattan. The Morses lived at 724 Fifth Avenue,724 Fifth Avenue, on the west side of the avenue, between 56th and 57th Streets, had been built for R. Fulton Cutting in 1882; it was a brownstone rowhouse of four storeys and an attic with asymmetrical Romanesque Revival details; it was illustrated in Century Magazine, February 1886. before moving to Lakewood Township, New Jersey. They maintained a summer home in Bath, Maine. Their marriage was annulled, however, in 1904 when it was determined that Clemence's divorce from her first husband, Charles F. Dodge, was not legal and she was therefore still married to him. Undeterred, she was represented by Samuel Untermyer, who restored her marital rights; she remained devotedly at the side of Morse until her death in 1926. Morse returned to the realm of shipping in 1901 when he established the Eastern Steamship Company as a consolidation of three existing lines. These were the Boston and Bangor Steamship Company, dating from 1834; the Portland Steam Packet Company, organized in 1843; and the International Steamship Company, established in 1859.George W. Hilton, The Night Boat, p. 97. Berkeley, California: Howell-North Books, 1968. In 1902 Morse acquired control of both overnight steamboat lines on the Hudson River - the People's Line, established in 1835, and the Citizens' Line, established in 1872 - and organized the Hudson Navigation Company to operate them. They were collectively known as the Hudson River Night Line. The People's Line named its new 411-foot steamer C.W. Morse in his honor in 1904.Hilton, pp. 120, 132. (Morse's uncle James Thomas Morse, his father's brother, was the namesake of the Rockland-Bar Harbor, Maine, steamer J.T. Morse, also built in 1904.Hilton, p. 112.) Morse acquired control of the Metropolitan Steamship Company from the Whitney interests in 1906. He organized the Consolidated Steamship Company in January 1907 as a holding company for the Eastern Steamship Company, Metropolitan Steamship Company, Clyde Steamship Company and Mallory Steamship Company. Despite an initial announcement of such a sale, Morse failed in an attempt to purchase the Long Island Sound steamers of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. He did, however, acquire control of the New York and Cuba Mail Steamship Company and the New York and Porto Rico Steamship Company in 1907. He parlayed this success into a prominent role in high finance in New York City. Morse controlled the National Bank of North America, the New Amsterdam National Bank and was a large owner of the Mercantile National Bank. He became a close associate of F. Augustus Heinze, who became president of Mercantile National, and E. R. Thomas, a young man of large inherited fortune. Their influence grew—Heinze and Morse served as directors together on at least six national banks, 10 state banks, five trust companies and four insurance companies.Robert F. Bruner and Sean D. Carr, The Panic of 1907. Lessons Learned From the Market's Perfect Storm, pp. 39-40. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley & Sons, 2007. Walter Lord, The Good Years. From 1900 to the First World War, pp. 182–183. New York: Harper & Brothers, 1960. === Panic of 1907 === By 1907, he was a member of the Consolidated Stock Exchange of New York, one of around 13,000. Along with Augustus Heinze's brothers, Morse helped create a pool of money to drive up and corner the stock of United Copper. On October 15, 1907 this corner failed so spectacularly that depositors with Morse's banks began to pull out their deposits. On October 20, the New York Clearing House, which had a critical role clearing checks between banks, forced Morse to resign from his banking interests. This did not stop the panic, however, which went on to topple the Knickerbocker Trust Company, New York's third largest trust, and led to financial turmoil across the country through November. The Morse-controlled steamship lines went into receivership, for varying periods, in February 1908.Hilton, pp. 97, 99. Indicted by United States District Attorney Henry L. Stimson, Morse was convicted of violations of federal banking laws. He was sentenced to 15 years in the Atlanta federal penitentiary in November 1908 but remained free on appeal.Pringle (1939). On October 8, 1909, the assets of the Metropolitan Steamship Company were sold at foreclosure sale to John W. McKinnon of Chicago. The company was reincorporated three days later in Maine with Morse as president. The Metropolitan Steamship Company and Maine Steamship Company were consolidated with the Eastern Steamship Company in 1911 to form Eastern Steamship Corporation. This concern went into receivership in 1914 and emerged in 1917 as Eastern Steamship Lines.Hilton, p. 99. Having exhausted his legal appeals, Morse departed for Atlanta penitentiary on January 2, 1910. In Atlanta he was a prisoner alongside Charles Ponzi, who would go on to create an eponymous fraudulent financial scheme, the Ponzi scheme, and earn a legacy as one of the most famous swindlers in American history. Because of Morse's wealth and connections, he launched a campaign of lawyers, lobbyists and famous journalists like Clarence W. Barron who urged President William Howard Taft for leniency. In 1912 Morse became ill, and a panel of Army doctors declared that he suffered from Bright's disease and other maladies and would soon die if he remained in prison. Taft signed his pardon, and Morse departed for medical treatment at Wiesbaden. However, it soon became known to the Justice Department that he had feigned illness by drinking a combination of soapsuds and chemicals. Taft later said that the case \\"shakes one's faith in expert examination.\\"Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. XIII, pp. 240–241.Bruner and Carr, p. 183. === Later business interests=== On his return from Europe, Morse returned to the shipping business. He still controlled the Hudson Navigation Company, which had not been involved in the crash of the Consolidated Steamship Company in 1907. Morse announced on January 11, 1916, plans for a new transoceanic steamship line, which he organized as the United States Shipping Company. This holding company exchanged its stock for that of 16 subsidiary companies, each organized around a steamship. During World War I he was president of the United States Steamship Company,\\"C. W.

The Virginia Shipbuilding Company won contracts to build 36 vessels for the war effort. The freighters were ordered by the United States Shipping Board, and Morse borrowed from the Emergency Fleet Corporation funds to carry out the contracts. Ultimately, 22 of the ships were completed; the other 14 were cancelled. Morse controlled the Hudson Navigation Company until its bankruptcy in 1921. The receivers quickly changed the name of the C.W. Morse to Fort Orange.Hilton, p. 121. In 1922 Morse was accused of misrepresentation of his facilities for ship construction; misapplication of funds intended for the building of ships to the building of shipyards; misappropriation of equipment for his own purposes; and failure to turn over to the government the profits of ships it had leased to him. Indicted for war profiteering and fraud, soon after he was confronted with charges of mail fraud involving sales solicitations for stock of the United States Shipping Company. The trial on the war profiteering charges resulted in an acquittal, but a civil suit in 1925 against the Virginia Shipbuilding Company resulted in a judgment for the government of over $11.5 million. The mail fraud case against Morse ended when he was adjudged too ill to stand trial, and after a jury had disagreed the charges against his sons were quashed.Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. XIII, p. 241; Bruner and Carr, p. 183. ==Personal life and death== On April 14, 1884, he married Hattie Bishop Hussey of Brooklyn, New York (granddaughter of Maine shipbuilder T. J. Southard). She bore him three sons (Benjamin W., Harry F., and Irwin A.) a daughter (Anna, who married Dr. John W. Geiger), and died in 1897.Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. XIII, p. 241. His second wife, Clemence Dodge, née Cowles, died in July 1926. Suffering from paralysis, Morse was placed under the guardianship of the probate court of Bath on September 7, 1926, adjudged incompetent to handle his affairs. Having suffered several strokes, he died of pneumonia at Bath, Maine, on January 12, 1933.Time, July 26, 1926. ==See also== *List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States ==ReferencesFurther reading== *\\"Charles W.

He began his football career with Old Park F.C. in Wednesbury in 1876 and then joined Wednesbury St. James F.C. in 1877. From there he joined Wednesbury Old Athletic in 1878. Holden established a reputation for being an extremely fast winger with exceptional dribbling skills. During his first spell with Wednesbury Old Athletic, he won four international caps. He made his international debut for England on 12 March 1881 against Scotland. England went down to a \\"humiliating\\" 6–1 defeat. His next appearances came three years later in 1884, when he played in all three matches in the inaugural British Home Championship. England's opening match was against Ireland at Ballynafeigh Park, Belfast on 26 January 1884. England \\"won the match with ease\\" 8–1, with Henry Cursham scoring a hat-trick on his final England appearance, with the remaining goals coming from Edward Johnson (2), Charles Bambridge (2) and his brother Arthur. In a close match against Scotland at Cathkin Park on 15 March, the Scots won 1–0. Despite this defeat, Holden retained his place for the final match of the tournament against Wales on 17 March, which England won comfortably 4–0, including two goals from William Bromley-Davenport. Scotland's victory over England enabled them to claim the Home Championship, which they were to dominate for the next few seasons. Holden's performances for England attracted the attention of West Bromwich Albion, whom he joined in May 1886, staying for a single season. Although Holden appeared in the early rounds of the FA Cup, including scoring in the First Round 6–0 victory over Burton Wanderers, he was no longer part of the side when Albion reached the Cup Final where they were to lose 2–0 to Aston Villa.

While the exact boundaries of the region are variously defined, the Bay Area is defined by the Association of Bay Area Governments to include the nine counties that border the aforementioned estuaries: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Sonoma, and San Francisco. Other boundaries may exclude parts of or even entire counties, or expand the definition to include neighboring counties that do not border the bay such as San Benito, San Joaquin, and Santa Cruz. Home to approximately 7.75 million people, Northern California's nine- county Bay Area contains many cities, towns, airports, and associated regional, state, and national parks, connected by a complex multimodal transportation network. The larger combined statistical area of the region, which includes fourteen counties, is the second-largest in California (after the Greater Los Angeles area), the fifth-largest in the United States, and the 41st-largest urban area in the world with 9.67 million people. The Bay Area's population is ethnically diverse: for example, roughly half of the region's residents are Hispanic, Asian, African American, or Pacific Islander, all of whom have a significant presence throughout the region. The earliest archaeological evidence of human settlements in the Bay Area dates back to 8000–10,000 BC (from shell mounds in the Coyote Hills). In 1769, the Bay Area was inhabited by the Ohlone people when a Spanish exploration party led by Gaspar de Portolà entered the Bay – the first documented European visit to the Bay Area. After Mexico established independence from Spain in 1821, the region was briefly controlled by the Mexican government until the United States purchased the territory in 1846 during the Mexican–American War. Soon after, discovery of gold in California attracted a flood of treasure seekers, many using ports in the Bay Area as an entry point. During the early years of California's statehood, state legislative business rotated between three locations in the Bay Area before a permanent state capital was established in Sacramento. A major earthquake leveled the city of San Francisco and environs in 1906, but the region quickly rebuilt in time to host the 1915 Panama- Pacific Exposition. During World War II, the Bay Area played a major role in America's war effort in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, with San Francisco's Fort Mason acting as a primary embarkation point for American forces. In 1945, the United Nations Charter was signed in San Francisco, establishing the United Nations, and in 1951, the Treaty of San Francisco officially ended the U.S.'s war with Japan. Since then, the Bay Area has experienced numerous political, cultural and artistic movements, developing unique local genres in music and art and establishing itself as a hotbed of progressive politics. Economically, the post-war Bay Area saw huge growth in the financial and technology industries, creating a vibrant and diverse economy with a gross domestic product of over $700 billion, and home to the third highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the United States (as of 2018). Despite its urban character, the San Francisco Bay is one of California's most ecologically important habitats, providing key ecosystem services such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers, and supporting a number of endangered species. In addition, the Bay is known for its strands of coast redwoods, many of which are protected in state and county parks. The region is also known for the complexity of its landforms, the result of millions of years of tectonic plate movements. Because the Bay Area is crossed by six major earthquake faults, the region is particularly exposed to hazards presented by large earthquakes. The climate is temperate and generally very mild, and is ideal for outdoor recreational and athletic activities such as hiking. The Bay Area is host to six professional sports teams and is a cultural center for music, theater, and the arts. It is also host to several institutions of higher education, ranging from primary schools to major research universities. Home to 101 municipalities and nine counties, governance in the Bay Area involves numerous local and regional actors, often with broad and overlapping responsibilities. ==Boundaries== Santa Clara county.alt=A map demarcating the boundaries of the nine-county Bay Area and the five subregions within. The borders of the San Francisco Bay Area are not officially delineated, and the unique development patterns influenced by the region's topography, as well as unusual commute patterns caused by the presence of three central cities and employment centers located in various suburban locales, has led to considerable disagreement between local and federal definitions of the area. Because of this, professor of geography at the University of California, Berkeley Richard Walker claimed that \\"no other U.S. city-region is as definitionally challenged [as the Bay Area].\\" When the region began to rapidly develop during and immediately after World War II, local planners settled on a nine-county definition for the Bay Area, consisting of the counties that directly border the San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun estuaries: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties. Today, this definition is accepted by most local governmental agencies including San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board, Bay Area Air Quality Management District, the San Francisco Bay Restoration Authority, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, and the Association of Bay Area Governments, the latter two of which partner to deliver a Bay Area Census using the nine-county definition. Various U.S. Federal government agencies use definitions that differ from their local counterparts' nine-county definition. For example, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) which regulates broadcast, cable, and satellite transmissions, includes nearby Colusa, Lake and Mendocino counties in their \\"San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose\\" media market, but excludes eastern Solano county. On the other hand, the United States Office of Management and Budget, which designates Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and Combined Statistical Areas (CSA) for populated regions across the country, has five MSAs which include, wholly or partially, areas within the nine-county definition, and one CSA which includes all nine counties plus neighboring San Benito, Santa Cruz and San Joaquin counties. ===Subregions=== Among locals, the nine-county Bay Area can be further divided into five sub-regions: the East Bay, North Bay, South Bay, Peninsula, and the city of San Francisco. Although geographically located on the tip of the San Francisco Peninsula, the city of San Francisco is not considered part of the \\"Peninsula\\" subregion, but as a separate entity. The \\"East Bay\\" is the densest region of the Bay Area outside of San Francisco and includes cities and towns in Alameda and Contra Costa counties, centered around Oakland. As one of the larger subregions, the East Bay includes a variety of enclaves, including the suburban Tri-Valley area and the highly urban western part of the subregion that runs alongside the bay. The \\"Peninsula\\" subregion includes the cities and towns on the San Francisco Peninsula, excluding the titular city of San Francisco. Its eastern half, which runs alongside the Bay, is highly populated while its less populated western coast traces the coastline of the Pacific Ocean and is known for its open space and hiking trails. Roughly coinciding with the borders of San Mateo county, it also includes the northwestern Santa Clara county cities of Palo Alto, Mountain View, and Los Altos. The \\"South Bay\\" includes all of the rest of the cities in Santa Clara county, centered around San Jose, the largest city in Northern California. It is roughly synonymous with Silicon Valley due to its high concentration of tech companies, although the industry also has a significant presence in the rest of the Bay Area. The \\"North Bay\\" includes Marin, Sonoma, Napa, and Solano counties, and is the largest and least populated subregion. The western counties of Marin and Sonoma are encased by the Pacific Ocean on the west and the bay on the east, and are characterized by its mountainous and woody terrain. Sonoma and Napa counties are known internationally for their grape vineyards and wineries, and Solano county to the east, centered around Vallejo, is the fastest growing region in the Bay Area. ==History== alt=A sketch of the native Ohlone people performing a dance. The earliest archaeological evidence of human habitation of the Bay Area dates to around 10,000 B.C. (Coyote Hills Shell Mound) along the shores of the bay, with evidence pointing to even earlier settlement in Point Reyes in Marin County. The Miwokan and Costanoan Ohlone people, who were living in the Bay Area at the time of first European contact, were possibly descended from Siberian tribes who arrived at around 1,000 BC by sailing over the Arctic Ocean and following the salmon migration. The Ohlone lived in about forty or so tribes spread throughout the lands adjacent to the San Francisco Bay and as far south as Point Sur near Monterey Bay. alt=An old image of Portsmouth Square from 1851. In 1575, a Spanish exploration party led by Sebastião Rodrigues Soromenho landed in Drakes Bay near Point Reyes and was the first European settler to claim land in the Bay Area. He was soon followed in 1579 by Sir Francis Drake, who also landed in Drakes Bay and claimed the land for England. The San Francisco Bay itself remained undiscovered by Europeans until a Spanish expedition led by Gaspar de Portolà sailed through the Golden Gate Strait in 1769. Further expeditions by Spanish explorers in the following years include those led by Juan Bautista de Anza who colonized the Presidio, and Gabriel Moraga who started at the Presidio and led expedition parties to San Jose and over the Pacheco Pass, as well as reaching the San Joaquin Valley. In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain and the Bay Area became part of the Mexican province of Alta California, a period characterized by ranch life and visiting American trappers. Mexico's control of the territory would be short-lived, however, and in 1846, a party of settlers occupied Sonoma Plaza and proclaimed the independence of the new Republic of California. That same year, the Mexican–American War began, and American captain John Berrien Montgomery sailed the into the bay and seized San Francisco, which was then known as Yerba Buena, and raised the American flag for the first time over Portsmouth Square. Discovery of gold near Sutter's Mill transformed the Bay Area, which saw a flood of immigrants seeking wealth and hoping to strike it rich.alt=An image of Sutter's Mill, where the Gold Rush took place. In 1848, James W. Marshall's discovery of gold in the American River sparked the California Gold Rush, and within half a year, 4,000 men were panning for gold along the river and finding $50,000 per day. The promise of fabulous riches quickly led to a stampede of wealth-seekers descending on Sutter's Mill. The Bay Area's population quickly emptied out as laborers, clerks, waiters, and servants joined the rush to find gold, and California's first newspaper, The Californian, was forced to announce a temporary freeze in new issues due to labor shortages. By the end of 1849, news had spread across the world and newcomers flooded into the Bay Area at a rate of one thousand per week on their way to California's interior, including the first large influx of Chinese immigrants to the U.S. The rush was so great that vessels were abandoned by the hundreds in San Francisco's ports as crews rushed to the gold fields. The unprecedented influx of new arrivals spread the nascent government authorities thin, and the military was unable to prevent desertions. As a result, numerous vigilante groups formed to provide order, but many tasked themselves with forcibly moving or killing local Native Americans, and by the end of the Gold Rush, two thirds of the indigenous population had been killed. During this same time, a constitutional convention was called to determine California's application for statehood into the United States. After statehood was granted, the capital city moved between three cities in the Bay Area: San Jose (1849–1851), Vallejo (1851–1852), and Benicia (1852–1853) before permanently settling in Sacramento in 1854. As the Gold Rush wound down, wealth generated from the endeavor led to the establishment of Wells Fargo Bank and the Bank of California, and immigrant laborers attracted by the promise of wealth transformed the demographic makeup of the region. Construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad from the Oakland Long Wharf attracted so many laborers from China that by 1870, eight percent of San Francisco's population was of Asian origin. The completion of the railroad connected the Bay Area with the rest of the United States, established a truly national marketplace for the trade of goods, and accelerated the urbanization of the region. Damaged buildings in the aftermath of the alt=A historical image of damaged and destroyed buildings after the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco In the early morning of April 18, 1906, a large earthquake with an epicenter near the city of San Francisco hit the region. Immediate casualty estimates by the U.S. Army's relief operations were 498 deaths in San Francisco, 64 deaths in Santa Rosa, and 102 in or near San Jose, for a total of about 700. More recent studies estimate the total death count to be over 3,000, with over 28,000 buildings destroyed. Rebuilding efforts began immediately. Amadeo Peter Giannini, owner of the Bank of Italy (now known as the Bank of America), had managed to retrieve the money from his bank's vaults before fires broke out through the city and was the only bank with liquid funds readily available and was instrumental in loaning out funds for rebuilding efforts. Congress immediately approved plans for a reservoir in Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park, a plan they had denied a few years earlier, which now provides drinking water for 2.4 million people in the Bay Area. By 1915, the city had been sufficiently rebuilt and advertised itself to the world during the Panama Pacific Exposition that year, although the effects of the quake hastened the loss of the region's dominant status in California to the Los Angeles metropolitan area. U.S. President alt=An image of President Truman speaking at a podium, addressing the United Nations Convention. During the 1929 stock market crash and subsequent economic depression, not a single San Francisco-based bank failed, while the region attempted to spur job growth by simultaneously undertaking two large infrastructure projects: construction of the Golden Gate Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Marin County, and the Bay Bridge, which would connect San Francisco with Oakland and the East Bay. After the United States joined World War II in 1941, the Bay Area became a major domestic military and naval hub, with large shipyards constructed in Sausalito and across the East Bay to build ships for the war effort, and Fort Mason acting the primary port of embarkation for service members shipping out to the Pacific Theater of Operations. After the war, the United Nations was chartered in San Francisco to help prevent the kind of devastation that occurred over the past decade, and in September 1951, Japan officially surrendered to the Allied forces in San Francisco, with the Treaty of San Francisco entering into force a year later. In the years immediately following the war, the Bay Area saw a huge wave of immigration as populations increased across the region. Between 1950 and 1960, San Francisco welcomed over 100,000 new residents, inland suburbs in the East Bay saw their populations double, Daly City's population quadrupled, and Santa Clara's population quintupled. alt=A pair of policemen mounted on horses observe a protest march down a street in San Francisco. By the early 1960s, the Bay Area and the rest of Northern California became the center of the counterculture movement. Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and the Haight- Ashbury neighborhood in San Francisco were seen as centers of activity, with the hit American pop song San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair) further enticing like-minded individuals to join the movement in the Bay Area and leading to the Summer of Love. In the proceeding decades, the Bay Area would cement itself as a hotbed of New Left activism, student activism, opposition to the Vietnam War and other anti-war movements, the black power movement, and the gay rights movement. At the same time, San Jose and the rest of the South Bay began to rapidly develop as it began to transition from a largely agricultural-based economy into the hotbed of the high-tech industry. Fred Terman, the director of a top-secret research project at Harvard University during World War II, joined the faculty at Stanford University in order to reshape the university's engineering department. His students, including David Packard and William Hewlett, would later help usher in the region's high-tech revolution. In 1955, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory opened for business near Stanford, and although the business venture was a financial failure, it was the first semiconductor company in the Bay Area, and the talent that it attracted to the region eventually led to a high-tech cluster of companies later known as Silicon Valley. The alt=A chart displaying the NASDAQ Composite Index, including a peak in 2000 that explains the Dot-com bubble phenomenon. The alt=An image of protestors marching down a street in Oakland. In 1989, in the middle of the World Series match between two Bay Area baseball teams, the Loma Prieta earthquake struck and caused widespread infrastructural damage, including the failure of the Bay Bridge, a major link between San Francisco and Oakland. Even so, the Bay Area's technology industry continued to expand and growth in Silicon Valley accelerated that the United States Census confirmed that year that San Jose had overtaken San Francisco in terms of population. The commercialization of the Internet in the middle of the decade rapidly created a speculative bubble in the high-tech economy known as the dot-com bubble. This bubble began collapsing in the early 2000s and the industry continued contracting for the next few years, nearly wiping out the market. Companies like Amazon.com and Google managed to weather the crash however, and following the industry's return to normalcy, their market value increased significantly. Even as the growth of the technology sector transformed the region's economy, progressive politics continued to guide the region's political environment. By the turn of the millennium, Non-Hispanic whites, the largest ethnic group in the United States, were only half of the population in the Bay Area as immigration among minority groups accelerated. During this time, the Bay Area was the center of the LGBT rights movement: in 2004, San Francisco began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, a first in the United States, and four years later, a majority of voters in the Bay Area rejected California Proposition 8, which sought to constitutionally restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples but ultimately passed statewide. The Bay Area was also the center of contentious protests concerning racial and economic inequality. In 2009, an African American man named Oscar Grant was fatally shot by Bay Area Rapid Transit police officers, precipitating widespread protests across the region and even riots in Oakland, and whose name was symbolically tied to the Occupy Oakland protests two years later that sought to fight against social and economic inequality. Following the Inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2017, the Bay Area became a center of resistance to his administration, beginning with widespread protests in concert with the nationwide Women's March a day later, followed by frequent public feuds between Trump and various Bay Area political, cultural, and business figures over issues of race and immigration, among others. On March 16, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, all residents of six counties in the Bay Area were required by local health authorities to stay in their homes under a shelter in place order, the first such order issued in the United States. Residents who were found outside and were not homeless, seeking emergency or health relief, or getting essential products such as food, were committing misdemeanors under to the order. The order was later expanded to cover the entire state of California three days later. ==CultureArts=== Art alt=An image of Pixar Animation Studio's headqarters. The Bay Area was a hub of the Abstract Expressionism movement of painting. It is associated with the works of Clyfford Still, who began teaching at the California School of Fine Arts (now the San Francisco Art Institute) in 1946, leaving a lasting impact on the artistic styles of Bay Area painters up to the present day. A few years later, Abstract Expressionist painter David Park painted Kids on Bikes in 1950, which retained many aspects of abstract expressionism but with original distinguishing features that would later lead to the Bay Area Figurative Movement. While both the Figurative Movement and the Abstract Expressionism movement arose from art schools, Funk art would later rise out of the region's underground and was characterized by informal sharing of technique among groups of friends and art showcases in \\"cooperative\\" galleries instead of formal museums. Later, the Bay Area art movement would be heavily influenced by the counterculture movement in the 1960s, and art produced during this time reflected the political environment. The Bay Area is presently home to a thriving computer animation industry led by Pixar Animation Studios and Industrial Light & Magic. Pixar, based in Emeryville, produced the first fully computer animated feature film, Toy Story, with software it designed in-house and whose computer animation films have since garnered 26 Academy Awards and critical acclaim. Industrial Light & Magic, which is based in the Presidio in San Francisco, was created in 1975 to help create visual effects for the Star Wars series has since been involved with creating visual effects for over three hundred Hollywood films. Music Throughout its recent history, the Bay Area has been home to several musical movements that left lasting influences on the genres they affected. San Francisco, in particular, was the center of the counterculture movement in the 1960s, which directly led to the rise of several notable musical acts: The Grateful Dead, which formed in 1965, and Jefferson Airplane and Janis Joplin; all three would be closely associated with the 1967 Summer of Love.T. Gitlin, The Sixties: Years of Hope, Days of Rage, (New York, 1993), p.215–217 Jimi Hendrix also had strong connections to the movement and the Bay Area, as he lived in Berkeley for a brief time as a child and played in many local venues in that decade. By the 1970s, San Francisco had developed a vibrant jazz scene, earning the moniker, \\"Harlem of the West\\". The Vietnam War was being fought at the time, and Bay Area bands such as Creedence Clearwater Revival of El Cerrito became known for their political and socially-conscious lyrics against the conflict. Carlos Santana rose to fame in the early 1970s with his Santana band and would later be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\\"Santana\\". Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Retrieved April 16, 2013. Two former members of Santana, Neal Schon and Gregg Rolie would later lead the formation of the band Journey. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the Bay Area became home to one of the largest and most influential thrash metal scenes in the world, with contributions from 3 of the \\"Big Four\\" of thrash metal, namely Metallica, Slayer, and Megadeth, and the emergence of the avant-garde metal with bands such as Giant Squid, Grayceon, and Ludicra.; The post-grunge era in the 1990s and featured prominent Bay Area bands Third Eye Blind of San Francisco, Counting Crows of Berkeley, and Smash Mouth of San Jose, and later pop punk rock bands like Green Day. The 1990s also saw the emergence of the influential hyphy movement in hip hop, derived from the Oakland slang for \\"hyperactive\\", and pioneered by Bay Area rappers Andre \\"Mac Dre\\" Hicks, Mistah Fab, and E-40. Other notable rappers from the Bay Area include Lil B, Tupac Shakur, MC Hammer, Too $hort, and G-Eazy. Today, much of the rap coming out of Oakland and the East Bay is \\"conscious rap\\", which concerns itself with social issues and awareness. The Bay Area is also home to hundreds of classical music ensembles, from community choirs to professional orchestras, such as the San Francisco Symphony, California Symphony, Fremont Symphony Orchestra, Oakland Symphony and the San Francisco Chamber Orchestra. Theater The alt=A picture of the Berkeley Repertory Theatre's headquarters. According to the regional theater service organization Theatre Bay Area, the San Francisco Bay Area is the third largest center of activity for theater companies and actors in the United States, after the New York City and Chicago metropolitan areas, with 400 companies spread throughout the region. The organization was founded in 1976 by the Magic Theatre and American Conservatory Theater (ACT) in San Francisco and the Berkeley Repertory Theatre in Berkeley. The latter two, along with the San Francisco Mime Troupe and Palo Alto-based Theatreworks, have since gone on to win one Regional Theatre Tony Award each. Several famous actors have arisen from the Bay Area's theatre community, including Daveed Diggs from Hamilton and Darren Criss from Hedwig, A Very Potter Musical, and Glee. Locally, well-regarded actors include James Carpenter, a stage actor who has performed at the ACT, Berkeley Repertory, and San Jose Repertory Theatre among others, Rod Gnapp of the Magic Theatre Company, Sean San Jose, one of the founders of the Campo Santo theater, and Campo Santo member Margo Hall. The Bay Area also has an active youth theater scene. ACT and the Berkeley Repertory both run classes and camps for young actors, as do the Peninsula Youth Theater and Willow Glen Children’s Theatre in the Peninsula and South Bay, Bay Area Children's Theater and Danville Children’s Musical Theater in the East Bay, and Marin Shakespeare in the North Bay, among many others. ===Media=== Old Chronicle Building, which housed the offices of the San Francisco Chronicle until 1924alt=An image of the Old Chronicle Building. The San Francisco Bay Area is the eighth-largest television market and the fourth-largest radio market in the U.S. The Bay Area's oldest radio station, KCBS (AM), began as an experimental station in San Jose in 1909, before the beginning of commercial broadcasting. KALW was the Bay Area's first FM radio station, and first radio station to begin commercial broadcasting west of the Mississippi River when it signed on the air in 1941. KPIX, which began broadcasting in 1948, was the first television station to air in the Bay Area and Northern California. All major U.S. television networks have affiliates serving the region, including KTVU 2 (FOX), KRON-TV 4 (Local News/MyNetwork), KPIX 5 (CBS), KGO-TV 7 (ABC), KQED-TV 9 (PBS), KNTV 11 (NBC), KBCW 44/45 (CW), KQEH 54 (PBS), and KKPX 65 (Ion). Bloomberg West, a show that focuses on topics pertaining to technology and business, was launched in 2011 from a studio in and continues to broadcast from San Francisco. Public broadcasting outlets include both a television station and a radio station, both broadcasting under the call letters KQED from a facility near the Potrero Hill neighborhood. KQED-FM is the most-listened-to National Public Radio affiliate in the country. Another local broadcaster, KPOO, is an independent, African- American owned and operated noncommercial radio station established in 1971. The largest newspapers in the Bay Area are the San Francisco Chronicle and San Jose Mercury News, the highest and second-highest most widely circulated newspaper in Northern California. The Chronicle is most famous for a former columnist, the late Herb Caen, whose daily musings attracted critical acclaim and represented the \\"voice of San Francisco\\". The San Francisco Examiner, once the cornerstone of William Randolph Hearst's media empire and the home of Ambrose Bierce, declined in circulation over the years and now takes the form of a free daily tabloid, under new ownership. Most of the Bay Area's local regions and municipalities also have their own newspapers, such as the East Bay Times and San Mateo Daily Journal. The national newsmagazine Mother Jones is also based in San Francisco. Non-English-language newspapers include several Chinese-language papers such as Sing Tao Daily, the largest in the Bay Area by circulation, and El Mundo, a free Spanish-language weekly distributed by the Mercury News. ===Sports and recreation=== alt=An image of Oracle Park, a baseball field drafting cyclists ascending Mount Hamilton in Santa Clara county The Bay Area is home to six professional major league sports franchises: The San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL) in American football, the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB), the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League (NHL), and the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer (MLS). In football, the 49ers play in Levi's Stadium and have won five Super Bowls (XVI, XIX, XXIII, XXIV, XXIX) and lost two (XLVII and LIV). In baseball, the Giants, who play at Oracle Park, have won eight World Series titles, three since relocating to San Francisco (2010, 2012, and 2014) from New York in 1958. The A's, who play at the Oakland Coliseum, have won nine World Series titles, four since relocating to Oakland (1972, 1973, 1974, and 1989) from Kansas City in 1968. In basketball, the Warriors play at the Chase Center and have won four NBA Finals (1975, 2015, 2017, and 2018) In hockey, the Sharks play at the SAP Center, despite making their first Stanley Cup Finals appearance in 2016, have not won the Stanley Cup. In soccer, the Earthquakes play at Avaya Stadium and have won the MLS Cup twice in 2001 and 2003. Outside of major league sports, the Bay Area is home to eight minor league teams. In hockey, the San Jose Barracuda play in the American Hockey League (AHL) and are the top affiliate of the San Jose Sharks, sharing the same rink at the SAP Center in San Jose. In baseball, The San Jose Giants in the California League of Minor League Baseball (MiLB) are the Class-A Advanced affiliate of the San Francisco Giants, playing out of the San Jose Municipal Stadium. There are six teams in the Pacific Association of Professional Baseball Clubs (Martinez Clippers, Napa Silverados, San Rafael Pacifics, Sonoma Stompers, Pittsburg Diamonds, and the Vallejo Admirals). In terms of collegiate sports, six Bay Area universities are members of NCAA Division I, the highest level of college sports in the country. All three football-playing schools in the Bay Area are in the Football Bowl Subdivision, the highest level of NCAA college football. The California Golden Bears and Stanford Cardinal compete in the Pac-12 Conference, and the San Jose State Spartans compete in the Mountain West Conference. The Cardinal and Golden Bears are intense rivals, with their football teams competing annually in the Big Game for the Stanford Axe. One of the most famous games in the rivalry occurred in 1982, when the Golden Bears defeated the Cardinal on a last-second return kickoff known as \\"The Play\\". The Bay Area has an ideal climate for outdoor recreation, such that activities like hiking and cycling are popular among locals. There are more than of bicycle paths, lanes and bike routes just within San Francisco, and the Embarcadero and Marina Green are favored sites for skateboarding. Extensive public tennis facilities are available in Golden Gate Park and Dolores Park, as well as at smaller neighborhood courts throughout the city. San Francisco residents have often ranked among the fittest in the U.S. Boating, sailing, windsurfing and kitesurfing are among the popular activities on San Francisco Bay, and the city maintains a yacht harbor in the Marina District. The St. Francis Yacht Club and Golden Gate Yacht Club are located in the Marina Harbor, while the South Beach Yacht Club is located next to Oracle Park. The Bay Area was host to the 2013 America's Cup. ==Demographics== According to the 2010 United States Census, the population of the nine-county Bay Area was 7.15 million, with 49.6% male and 50.4% female. Of these, approximately 2.3 million (32%) are foreign born. In 2010 the racial makeup of the nine-county Bay Area was 52.5% White (42.4% were non-Hispanic and 10.1% were Hispanic), 23.3% Asian, 6.7% non-Hispanic Black or African American, 0.7% Native American or Alaska Native, 0.6% Pacific Islander, 5.4% from two or more races and 10.8% from other races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race formed 23.5% of the population. The Bay Area cities of Vallejo, Suisun City, Oakland, San Leandro, Fairfield, and Richmond are among the most ethnically diverse cities in the United States. Non- Hispanic whites form majorities of the population in Marin, Napa, and Sonoma counties. Whites also make up the majority in the eastern regions of the East Bay centered around the Lamorinda and Tri-Valley areas. San Francisco's North Beach district is considered the Little Italy of the city, and was once home to a significant Italian-American community. San Francisco, Marin County and the Lamorinda area all have substantial Jewish communities. The Latino population is spread throughout the Bay Area, but among the nine counties, the greatest number of them live in Santa Clara County, while Contra Costa County sees the highest growth rate. The largest Hispanic or Latino groups were those of Mexican (17.9%), Salvadoran (1.3%), Guatemalan (0.6%), Puerto Rican (0.6%) and Nicaraguans (0.5%) ancestry. Mexican Americans make up the largest share of Hispanic residents in Napa county, while Central Americans make up the largest share in San Francisco, many of whom live in the Mission District which is home to many residents of Salvadoran and Guatemalan descent. The Asian-American population in the Bay Area is one of the largest in the United States. Asian-Americans make up the plurality in two major counties in the Bay Area: Santa Clara County and Alameda County. The largest Asian-American groups were those of Chinese (7.9%), Filipino (5.1%), Indian (3.3%), Vietnamese (2.5%), and Japanese (0.9%) heritage. Daly City has the highest proportion of Asian-American residents (58.4%) in a large U.S. city outside of Hawaii. Asian Americans also constitute a majority in Cupertino, Fremont, Milpitas, Union City and significant populations in Dublin, Foster City, Hercules, Millbrae, San Ramon, Saratoga, Sunnyvale and Santa Clara. The cities of San Jose and San Francisco had the third and fourth most Asian-American residents in the United States. In San Francisco, Chinese Americans constitute 21.4% of the population and constitute the single largest ethnic group in the city. The Bay Area is home to over 382,950 Filipino Americans, one of the largest communities of Filipino people outside of the Philippines with the largest proportion of Filipino Americans concentrating themselves within American Canyon, Daly City, Fairfield, Hercules, South San Francisco, Union City and Vallejo. Santa Clara county, and increasingly the East Bay, house a significant Indian American community. There are more than 100,000 people of Vietnamese ancestry residing within San Jose city limits, the largest Vietnamese population of any city in the world outside of Vietnam. In addition, there is a sizable community of Korean Americans in Santa Clara county, where San Jose is located. East Bay cities such as Richmond and Oakland, and the North Bay city of Santa Rosa, have plentiful populations of Laotian and Cambodians in certain neighborhoods. Pacific Islanders such as Samoans and Tongans have the largest presence in East Palo Alto, where they constitute over 7% of the population. The African- American population of San Francisco was formerly substantial, had a thriving jazz scene and was known as \\"Harlem of the West.\\" While black residents formed one-seventh of the city's population in 1970, today they have mostly moved to parts of the East Bay and North Bay, including Antioch, Fairfield and out of the Bay Area entirely. The South Park neighborhood of Santa Rosa was once home to a primarily black community until the 1980s, when many Latino immigrants settled in the area. Other cities with large numbers of African Americans include Vallejo (28%), Richmond (26%), East Palo Alto (17%) and the CDP of Marin City (38%).http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/cdp/MarinCityCDP2010.pdf Since the economy of the Bay Area heavily relies on innovation and high-tech skills, a greater, educated population exists in the region. Roughly 87.4% of Bay Area residents have attained a high school degree or higher,Community Facts. (2010, October 5). [United States Census Bureau]. Retrieved from factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/community_facts.xhtml#. while 46% of adults in the Bay Area have earned a post-secondary degree or higher.Scott, W. Richard, and Michael W. Krist. Higher Education and Silicon Valley: Connected but Conflicted. Johns Hopkins University Press, 2017. The Bay Area is one of the wealthiest regions in the United States, due, primarily, to the economic power engines of San Jose, San Francisco, and Oakland. The Bay Area city of Pleasanton has the second-highest household income in the country after New Canaan, Connecticut. However, discretionary income is very comparable with the rest of the country, primarily because the higher cost of living offsets the increased income. By 2014, the Bay Area's wealth gap was considerable: the top ten percent of income-earners took home over eleven times as much as the bottom ten percent, and a Brookings Institution study found the San Francisco metro area, which excludes four Bay Area counties, to be the third most unequal urban area in the country. Among the wealthy, there are forty-seven Bay Area residents made the Forbes magazine's 400 richest Americans list, published in 2007. Thirteen lived in San Francisco proper, placing it seventh among cities in the world. Among the forty-seven were several well-known names such as Steve Jobs, George Lucas, and Charles Schwab. The wealthiest resident was Larry Ellison of Oracle, worth $25 billion. A study by Capgemini indicates that in 2009, 4.5 percent of all households within the San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose metropolitan areas held $1 million in investable assets, placing the region first in the United States, just ahead of the New York City metro region. On the other hand, low income residents in the Bay Area saw their incomes fall by nine percent since 2007, with the bottom ten percent earning just $20,000 on average. { class=\\" sortable mw-collapsible mw- collapsed collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"width: 100%;\\" - ! colspan=9  Counties by population and ethnicity - !

Historically, violent crime has been concentrated in a few cities in the East Bay, namely Oakland, Richmond, and Antioch, but also East Palo Alto in the Peninsula, Vallejo in the North Bay, and San Francisco. Nationally, Oakland's murder rate ranked 18th among cities with over 100,000 residents, and third for violent crimes per capita. According to a 2015 Federal Bureau of Investigation report, Oakland was also the source of the most violent crime in the Bay Area, with 16.9 reported incidents per thousand people. Vallejo came in second, at 8.7 incidents per thousand people, while San Pablo, Antioch, and San Francisco rounded out the top five. East Palo Alto, which used to have the Bay Area's highest murder rate, saw violent crime incidents drop 65% between 2013 and 2014, while Oakland saw violent crime incidents drop 15%. Meanwhile, San Jose, which was one of the safest large cities in the United States in the early 2000s, has seen its violent crime rates trend upwards. Cities with the lowest rate of violent crime include the Peninsula cities of Los Altos and Foster City, East Bay cities of San Ramon and Danville, and South Bay cities of Saratoga and Cupertino. In 2015, 45 Bay Area cities counted zero homicides, the largest of which was Daly City. In 2015, Oakland also saw the highest rates of property crime in the Bay Area, at 59.4 incidents per thousand residents, with San Francisco following close behind at 53 incidents per thousand residents. The East Bay cities Pleasant Hill, Berkeley, and San Leandro rounded out the top five. The South Bay city of Saratoga and the North Bay city of Windsor saw the least rates of property crime. Additionally, San Francisco saw the most reports of arson. Several street gangs operate in the Bay Area, including the Sureños and Norteños in San Francisco's Mission District. African-American street gangs familiar in other cities, including the Crips, have struggled to establish footholds in the city, although gangs with shotcallers in China, including Triad groups such as the Wo Hop To, have been reported active. In 1977, an ongoing rivalry between two Chinese gangs led to a shooting attack at the Golden Dragon restaurant in Chinatown, which left five people dead and eleven wounded. Five members of the Joe Boys gang were arrested and convicted of the crime. Oakland, which also sees organized gang violence, implemented Operation Ceasefire in 2012 in an effort to reduce the violence. ==Economy== alt=An image of Google's corporate headquarters. The three principal cities of the Bay Area represent different employment clusters and are dominated by different, but commingled, industries. San Francisco is home to the region's financial and business industry, tourism, and is host to numerous conventions. The East Bay, centered around Oakland, is home to heavy industry, metalworking, oil, and shipping, while San Jose is the heart of Silicon Valley where a major pole of economic activity around the technology industry resides. Furthermore, the North Bay is a major player in the country's agriculture and wine industry. In all, the Bay Area is home to the second highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies, second only to the New York metropolitan area, with thirty such companies based throughout the region. In 2017, the greater twelve-county statistical area had a GDP of $878 billion, the third-highest among combined statistical areas. In 2016, the smaller nine- county Bay Area had a GDP of $781 billion, which nonetheless would rank it 5th among U.S. states and 18th among countries. Several major corporations are headquartered in the Bay Area. Among the Fortune 500 companies located in the region include technology companies Google, Facebook, Apple Inc., Hewlett Packard, Intel, Adobe Inc., Applied Materials, eBay, Cisco Systems, Symantec, Oracle, Netflix, Sony Interactive Entertainment, Electronic Arts, and Salesforce; energy companies Chevron and PG&E; financial service companies Charles Schwab Corporation, Visa Inc., and Wells Fargo; apparel retailers Gap Inc., Levi Strauss & Co., and Ross Stores; aerospace and defense contractor Lockheed Martin; local grocer Safeway; pharmaceutical company McKesson; and biotechnology companies Genentech and Gilead Sciences. The largest manufacturers include Tesla Inc., Lam Research, Bayer, Chevron, and Coca-Cola. Oakland is the site of the fifth-largest container shipping port in the United States and is also a major rail terminus. In research, NASA's Ames Research Center and the federal research facility Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are based in Mountain View and Livermore respectively. In the North Bay, Napa and Sonoma counties are known for their famous wineries, including Fantesca Estate & Winery, Domaine Chandon California, and D'Agostini Winery. Despite the San Francisco Bay Area's booming industries contributing to the aforementioned economic growth, there is a significant level of poverty in the region. Rising housing prices and gentrification in the San Francisco Bay Area are often framed as symptomatic of high-income tech workers moving in to previously low-income, underserved neighborhoods. As of June 2014, median rent in San Francisco increased to $2,300, a 21% in one year. In Oakland, median rent increased by one-third between 2011 and 2013. Two notable policy strategies to prevent eviction due to rising rents include rent control and subsidies such as Section 8 and Shelter Plus Care. Moreover, in 2002, then San Francisco Supervisor Gavin Newsom introduced the \\"Care Not Cash\\" initiative, diverting funds away from cash handouts (which he argued encouraged drug use) to housing. This proved controversial, with some suggesting his rhetoric criminalized poverty, while others supporting the prioritizing of housing as a solution. To this day, the effectiveness of Care Not Cash continues to be debated. Contrary to historical patterns of low incomes within the inner city, poverty rates in the Bay Area are shifting such that they are increasing more rapidly in suburban areas than in urban areas. It is not yet clear whether the suburbanization of poverty is due to the relocation of poor populations or shifting income levels in the respective regions. However, the mid-2000s housing boom encouraged city dwellers to move into the newly cheap houses in suburbs outside of the city, and these suburban housing developments were then most impacted by the 2008 housing bubble burst. As such, people in poverty experience decreased access to transportation due to underdeveloped public transport infrastructure in suburban areas. Suburban poverty is most prevalent among Hispanics and Blacks, and affects native-born people more significantly than foreign-born. As greater proportions of incomes are spent on rent, many impoverished populations in the San Francisco Bay Area also face food insecurity and health setbacks. == Housing == The Bay Area is the most expensive place to live in the United States. Strong economic growth has created hundreds of thousands of new jobs, but coupled with severe restrictions on building new housing units, has resulted in an extreme housing shortage. For example, from 2012 to 2017, the San Francisco metropolitan area added 400,000 new jobs, but only 60,000 new housing units. As of 2016, the entire Bay Area had 3.6 M jobs, and 2.6 M housing units, for a ratio of 1.4 jobs per housing unit, significantly above the ratio for the US as a whole, which stands at 1.1 jobs per housing unit. (152M jobs, 136M housing units) According to a survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau, the Bay Area ranks #1 \\"in median home value, median monthly costs for homes with a mortgage, and median gross rent.\\" Bee, C. A. (2013). The Geographic Concentration of High-Income Households: 2007-2011 (No. ACSBR/11-23). United States Census Bureau.Bay Area burden. [electronic resource] : examining the costs and impacts of housing and transportation on Bay Area residents, their neighborhoods and the environment. (2009). Washington, DC : Urban Land Institute, c2009. As of 2017, the average income needed in order to purchase a house in the region was $179,390, while the median price for a house was $895,000 and the average cost of a home in the Bay Area being $440,000 - more than twice the national average, while the average monthly rent is $1,240 - 50 percent more than the national average.Alamo, C., Uhler, B., & O'Malley, M. (2015). California's high housing costs : causes and consequences. Sacramento, CA : Legislative Analyst's Office, March 17, 2015. In 2018, a Bay Area household income of $117,000 was classified as \\"low income\\" by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Dense Infrastructure in Downtown San Francisco With high costs of living, many Bay Area residents allocate large amounts of their income towards housing. 20 percent of Bay Area homeowners spend more than half their income on housing, while roughly 25 percent of renters in the Bay Area spend more than half of their incomes on rent.Bay Area Burden. [Electronic Resource] : Examining the Costs and Impacts of Housing and Transportation on Bay Area Residents, Their Neighborhoods and the Environment. Washington, DC : Urban Land Institute, c2009., 2009. EBSCOhost Expending an average of more than $28,000 per year on housing in addition to roughly $13,400 on transportation, Bay Area residents spend around $41,420 per year to live in the region. This combined total of housing and transportation signifies 59 percent of the Bay Area's median household income, conveying the extreme costs of living. The high rate of homelessness in the Bay Area can be attributed to the high cost of living.Quigley, J. M., Raphael, S., & Smolensky, E. (2001). Homelessness in California. San Francisco, Calif. : Public Policy Institute of California, 2001. No approximate number of homeless people living in the Bay Area can be determined due to the difficulty of tracking homeless residents. However, according to San Francisco’s Department of Public Health, the number of homeless people in San Francisco alone is 9,975.Suzuki, L. (2016, June 28). How Many People Live on Our Streets? San Francisco Chronicle. Retrieved from projects.sfchronicle.com/sf- homeless/numbers/. Additionally, San Francisco was revealed to have the most unsheltered homeless people in the country. Because of the high cost of housing, many workers in the Bay Area live far from their place of employment, contributing to one of the highest percentages of extreme commuters in the United States, or commutes that take over ninety minutes in one direction. For example, about 50,000 people commute from neighboring San Joaquin county into the nine-county Bay Area daily, and more extremely, some workers commute semimonthly by flying. ==EducationColleges and universities=== alt=An image of UC Berkeley's campus. Aerial View of Stanford Campus, 2018 The Bay Area is home to a large number of colleges and universities. The three most notable universities are Stanford University, University of California, Berkeley, and University of California, San Francisco all considered among the most prestigious universities in the world. The first institution of higher education in the Bay Area, Santa Clara University, was founded by Jesuits in 1851, who also founded the University of San Francisco in 1855. San Jose State University was founded in 1857 and is the oldest public college on the West Coast of the United States. According to the Brookings Institution, 45% of residents of the two-county San Jose metro area have a college degree and 43% of residents in the five-county San Francisco metro area have a college degree, the second and fourth highest ranked metro areas in the country for higher educational attainment. Rankings compiled by U.S. News & World Report feature several Bay Area universities in prominent spots. Stanford University is the highest ranked university in the Bay Area, and seventh overall in the United States. The University of California, Berkeley is ranked twentieth overall, but for the past nineteen years has been highest-ranked public university in the country. Additionally, San Jose State University and Sonoma State University were respectively ranked sixth and tenth among public colleges in the West Coast. The city of San Francisco is host to two additional University of California schools, neither of which confer undergraduate degrees. The University of California, San Francisco is entirely dedicated to graduate education in health and biomedical sciences. It is ranked among the top five medical schools in the United States and operates the UCSF Medical Center, which is the highest-ranked hospital in California. The University of California, Hastings College of the Law, founded in Civic Center in 1878, is the oldest law school in California and claims more judges on the state bench than any other institution. The city is also host to a California State University school, San Francisco State University. Additional campuses of the California State University system in the Bay Area are Cal State East Bay in Hayward and Cal Maritime in Vallejo. California Community Colleges System also operates a number of community colleges in the Bay Area. According to CNNMoney, the Bay Area community college with the highest \\"success\\" rate is De Anza College in Cupertino, which is also the tenth- highest ranked in the nation. Other relatively well-ranked Bay Area community colleges include Foothill College, City College of San Francisco, West Valley College, Diablo Valley College, and Las Positas College. Many scholars have pointed out the overlap of education and the economy within the Bay Area. According to multiple reports, research universities such as Stanford University, University of California - Santa Cruz and University of California - Berkeley, are essential to the culture and economy in the area. These universities also provide countless, public programs for people to learn and enhance skills relevant to the local economies. These opportunities not only provide educational services to the community, but also generate significant amounts of revenue. ===Primary and secondary schools=== Public primary and secondary education in the Bay Area is provided through school districts organized through three structures: elementary school districts, high school districts, or unified school districts, and are governed by an elected board. In addition, many Bay Area counties and the city of San Francisco operate \\"special service schools\\" that are geared towards providing education to students with handicaps or special needs. An alternative public educational setting is offered by charter schools, which may be established with a renewable charter of up to five years by third parties. The mechanism for charter schools in the Bay Area is governed by the California Charter Schools Act of 1992. According to rankings compiled by U.S. News & World Report, the highest-ranked high school in California is the Pacific Collegiate School, located in Santa Cruz and part of the greater Bay Area. Within the traditional nine-county boundaries, the highest ranked high school is KIPP San Jose Collegiate in San Jose. Among the top twenty high schools in California include Lowell High School in San Francisco, Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, the University Preparatory Academy in San Jose, Mission San Jose High School in Fremont, Oakland Charter High School in Oakland, Henry M. Gunn High School in Palo Alto, and Saratoga High School in Saratoga. ==GeographyClimate=== The Bay Area is located in the relatively rare warm-summer Mediterranean climate zone (Köppen Csb) that is a characteristic of California's coast, featuring mild to cool winters with occasional rainfall, and warm to hot, dry summers. It is largely influenced by the cold California Current, which penetrates the natural mountainous barrier along the coast by traveling through various gaps. In terms of precipitation, this means that the Bay Area has pronounced wet and dry seasons. The wet season, which roughly runs between November and March, is the source of about 82% of annual precipitation in the area. In the South Bay and further inland, while the wet season is cool and mild, the summer dry season is characterized by warm sunny days, while in San Francisco and areas closer to the Golden Gate strait, the dry season is periodically affected by fog. Due to the Bay Area's diverse topography, the result of the clashing tectonic plates, the region is home to numerous microclimates that lead to pronounced differences in climate and temperature over short distances. Within the city of San Francisco, natural and artificial topographical features direct the movement of wind and fog, resulting in startlingly varied climates between city blocks. Along the Golden Gate Strait, oceanic wind and fog from the Pacific Ocean are able to penetrate the mountain barriers inland into the Bay Area. During the summer, rising hot air in California's interior valleys creates a low pressure area that draws winds from the North Pacific High through the Golden Gate, which creates the city's characteristic cool winds and fog. The microclimate phenomenon is most pronounced during this time, when fog penetration is at its maximum in areas near the Golden Gate strait, while the South Bay and areas further inland are sunny and dry. Along the San Francisco peninsula, gaps in the Santa Cruz Mountains, one south of San Bruno Mountain and another in Crystal Springs, allow oceanic weather into the interior and causing a cooling effect for cities along the Peninsula and even as far south as San Jose. This weather pattern is also the source for delays at San Francisco International Airport. In Marin county north of the Golden Gate strait, two gaps north of Muir Woods bring cold air across the Marin Headlands, with the cooling effect reaching as far north as Santa Rosa. Further inland, the East Bay receives oceanic weather that travels through the Golden Gate strait, and further diffuses that air through the Berkeley Hills, Niles Canyon and the Hayward Pass into the Livermore Valley and Altamont Pass. Here, the resulting breeze is so strong that it is home to one of the world's largest array of wind turbines. Further north, the Carquinez Strait funnels the ocean weather into the San Joaquin River Delta, causing a cooling effect in Stockton and Sacramento, so that these cities are also cooler than their Central Valley counterparts in the south. { class=\\" sortable nowrap\\" \\"text-align: center;font-size:90%\\" style=\\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\\" + Average daily high and low temperatures in °F (°C) for selected locations in the Bay Area, colored and sortable by average monthly temperature - ! data-sort-type=\\"text\\" scope=\\"col\\"  City ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\" scope=\\"col\\"  ! data-sort- type=\\"number\\" scope=\\"col\\"  ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\" scope=\\"col\\"  ! data- sort-type=\\"number\\" scope=\\"col\\"  ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\" scope=\\"col\\"  May ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\" scope=\\"col\\"  ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\" scope=\\"col\\"  ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\" scope=\\"col\\"  ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\" scope=\\"col\\"  ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\" scope=\\"col\\"  ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\" scope=\\"col\\"  ! data-sort-type=\\"number\\" scope=\\"col\\"  - !

A California golden beaver in alt=An image of a California golden beaver. The Bay Area is home to a diverse array of wildlife and, along with the connected San Joaquin River Delta represents one of California's most important ecological habitats. California's Dungeness crab, Pacific halibut, and the California scorpionfish are all significant components of the bay's fisheries. The bay's salt marshes now represent most of California's remaining salt marsh and support a number of endangered species and provide key ecosystem services such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers. Most famously, the bay is a key link in the Pacific Flyway and with millions of shorebirds annually visiting the bay shallows as a refuge, is the most important component of the flyway south of Alaska. Many endangered species of birds are also found here: the California least tern, the California clapper rail, the snowy egret, and the black crowned night heron. There is also a significant diversity of salmonids present in the bay. Steelhead populations in California have dramatically declined due to human and natural causes; in the Bay Area, all naturally spawned anadromous steelhead populations below natural and manmade impassable barriers in California streams from the Russian River to Aptos Creek, and the drainages of San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun Bays are listed as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. The Central California Coast coho salmon population is the most endangered of the many troubled salmon populations on the west coast of the United States, including populations residing in tributaries to the San Francisco Bay. Industrial, mining, and other uses of mercury have resulted in a widespread distribution of that poisonous metal in the bay, with uptake in the bay's phytoplankton and contamination of its sportfish. Aquatic mammals are also present in the bay. Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans were drawn to the Bay Area to harvest prodigious quantities of beaver, river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and fur seals and sea otter. This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was more than any other single factor, responsible for opening up the West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. Since then, the California golden beaver has re-established a presence in the Alhambra Creek. The North American river otter which was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, has since been spotted in the North Bay's Corte Madera Creek, the South Bay's Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina. Other mammals include the internationally famous sea lions who began inhabiting San Francisco's Pier 39 after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the locally famous Humphrey the Whale, a humpback whale who entered San Francisco Bay twice on errant migrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises have recently returned to the bay, having been absent for many decades. Historically, this was the northern extent of their warm-water species range. Birds alt=An image of a family of burrowing owls inside their holes. In addition to the many species of marine birds that can be seen in the Bay Area, many other species of birds make the Bay Area their home, making the region a popular destination for birdwatching. Many birds, including many described in the following paragraphs, are listed as endangered species despite once being common in the region, due to human and other impacts. Western burrowing owls were originally listed as a species of special concern by the California Department of Fish and Game in 1979. California's population declined 60% from the 1980s to the early 1990s, and continues to decline at roughly 8% per year. A 1992–93 survey reported little to no breeding burrowing owls in most of the western counties in the Bay Area, leaving only Alameda, Contra Costa, and Solano counties as remnants of a once large breeding range. Bald eagles were once common in the Bay Area, but habitat destruction and thinning of eggs from DDT poisoning reduced the California state population to 35 nesting pairs. Bald eagles disappeared from the Bay Area in 1915, and only began returning in recent years. In the 1980s an effort to re-introduce the species to the area began with the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group and the San Francisco Zoo importing birds and eggs from Vancouver Island and northeastern California, and there are now nineteen nesting couples in eight of the Bay Area's nine counties. Other once absent species that have returned to the Bay Area include Swainson’s hawk, white tailed kite, and the osprey. In 1927, zoologist Joseph Grinnell wrote that osprey were only rare visitors to the San Francisco Bay Area, although he noted records of one or two used nests in the broken tops of redwood trees along the Russian River. In 1989, the southern breeding range of the osprey in the Bay Area was Kent Lake, although osprey were noted to be extending their range further south in the Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada. In 2014, a Bay Area-wide survey found osprey had extended their breeding range southward with nesting sites as far south as Hunters Point in San Francisco on the west side and Hayward on the east side, while further studies have found nesting sites as far south as the Los Gatos Creek watershed, indicating that the nesting range now includes the entire length of San Francisco Bay. Most nests were built on man-made structures close to areas of human disturbance, likely due to lack of mature trees near the Bay. The wild turkey population was introduced in the 1960s by state game officials, and by 2015 have become a common sight in East Bay communities. ===Geology and landforms=== Satellite photo of the Bay Area taken in March 2019. The gray areas are signs of urbanization and represent the most populated areas. The Bay Area is well known for the complexity of its landforms that are the result of the forces of plate tectonics acting over of millions of years, since the region is located in the middle of a meeting point between two plates. Nine out of eleven distinct assemblages have been identified in a single county, Alameda.Preliminary geologic map emphasizing bedrock formations in Alameda County, California: A digital database USGS Publication Diverse assemblages adjoin in complex arrangements due to offsets along the many faults (both active and stable) in the area. As a consequence, many types of rock and soil are found in the region. The oldest rocks are metamorphic rocks that are associated with granite in the Salinian Block west of the San Andreas fault. These were formed from sedimentary rocks of sandstone, limestone, and shale in uplifted seabeds. Volcanic deposits also exist in the Bay Area, left behind by the movement of the San Andreas fault, whose movement sliced a subduction plate and allowed magma to briefly flow to the surface. M6.7 or higher earthquake occurring on each fault line between 2003 and 2032alt=A map tracing all the fault lines in the Bay Area, and listing probabilities of earthquakes occurring on them. The region has considerable vertical relief in its landscapes that are not in the alluvial plains leading to the bay or in inland valleys. The topography, and geologic history, of the Bay Area can largely be attributed to the compressive forces between the Pacific Plate and the North American plate. The three major ridge structures in the Bay Area, part of the Pacific Coast Range, are all roughly parallel to the major faults. The Santa Cruz Mountains along the San Francisco Peninsula and the Marin Hills in Marin County follow the San Andreas fault, The Berkeley Hills, San Leandro Hills and their southern ridgeline extension through Mission Peak roughly follow the Hayward fault, and the Diablo Range, which includes Mount Diablo and Mount Hamilton and runs along the Calaveras fault. In total, the Bay Area is traversed by seven major fault systems with hundreds of related faults, all of which are stressed by the relative motion between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate or by compressive stresses between these plates. The fault systems include the Hayward Fault Zone, Concord-Green Valley Fault, Calaveras Fault, Clayton-Marsh Creek-Greenville Fault, Rodgers Creek Fault, and the San Gregorio Fault. Significant blind thrust faults (faults with near vertical motion and no surface ruptures) are associated with portions of the Santa Cruz Mountains and the northern reaches of the Diablo Range and Mount Diablo. These \\"hidden\\" faults, which are not as well known, pose a significant earthquake hazard. Among the more well-understood faults, as of 2014, scientists estimate a 72% probability of a magnitude 6.7 earthquake occurring along either the Hayward, Rogers Creek, or San Andreas fault, with an earthquake more likely to occur in the East Bay's Hayward Fault. Two of the largest earthquakes in recent history were the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. ===Hydrography=== A map of the water features in the San Francisco Bay Area, including the bay and adjacent alt=A map of all the water features in the Bay Area. The Bay Area is home to a complex network of watersheds, marshes, rivers, creeks, reservoirs, and bays that predominantly drain into the San Francisco Bay and Pacific Ocean. The largest bodies of water in the Bay Area are the San Francisco, San Pablo, and Suisun estuaries. Major rivers of the North Bay include the Napa River, the Petaluma River, the Gualala River, and the Russian River; the former two drain into San Pablo Bay, the latter two into the Pacific Ocean. In the South Bay, the Guadalupe River drains into San Francisco Bay near Alviso. There are also several lakes present in the Bay Area, including man-made lakes like Lake Berryessa and natural albeit heavily modified lakes like Lake Merritt. Prior to the introduction of European agricultural methods, the shores of San Francisco Bay consisted mostly of tidal marshes. Today, the bay has been significantly altered heavily re-engineered to accommodate the needs of water delivery, shipping, agriculture, and urban development, with side effects including the loss of wetlands and the introduction of contaminants and invasive species.Kimmerer, W. (2004). \\"Open water process of the San Francisco Estuary: from physical forcing to biological responses. \\" San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science 2(1). pp. 1–13. Approximately 85% of those marshes have been lost or destroyed, but about 50 marshes and marsh fragments remain. Huge tracts of the marshes were originally destroyed by farmers for agricultural purposes, then repurposed to serve as salt evaporation ponds to produce salt for food and other purposes. Today, regulations limit the destruction of tidal marshes, and large portions are currently being rehabilitated to their natural state. ==Government and politics== alt=An image of the San Francisco City Hall. Government in the San Francisco Bay Area consists of multiple actors, including 101 city and nine county governments, a dozen regional agencies, and a large number of single-purpose special districts such as municipal utility districts and transit districts. Incorporated cities are responsible for providing police service, zoning, issuing building permits, and maintaining public streets among other duties. County governments are responsible for elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, agricultural regulations, and building inspections, among other duties. Public education is provided by independent school districts, which may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts, and are managed by an elected school board. A variety of special districts also exist and provide a single purpose, such as delivering public transit in the case of the Bay Area Rapid Transit District, or monitoring air quality levels in the case of the Bay Area Air Quality Management District. Politics in the Bay Area is widely regarded as one of the most liberal in California and in the United States. Since the late 1960s, the Bay Area has cemented its role as the most liberal region in California politics, giving greater support for the center-left Democratic Party's candidates than any other region of the state, even as California trended towards the Democratic Party over time. According to research by the Public Policy Institute of California, the Bay Area and the North Coast counties of Humboldt and Mendocino were the most consistently and strongly liberal areas in California. According to the California Secretary of State, the Democratic Party holds a voter registration advantage in every congressional district, State Senate district, State Assembly district, State Board of Equalization district, all nine counties, and all of the 101 incorporated municipalities in the Bay Area. On the other hand, the center-right Republican Party holds a voter registration advantage in only one State Assembly sub-district (the portion of the 4th in Solano County). According to the Cook Partisan Voting Index (CPVI), congressional districts the Bay Area tends to favor Democratic candidates by roughly 40 to 50 percentage points, considerably above the mean for California and the nation overall. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed sortable\\" style=\\"width: 100%;\\" - + colspan=\\"8\\"  Bay Area counties by population and voter registration - !

The last county to vote for a Republican presidential candidate was Napa county in 1988 for George H. W. Bush. Since then, all nine Bay Area counties have voted consistently for the Democratic candidate. Currently, both of California's U.S. Senators are Democrats, and all twelve U.S. congressional districts located wholly or partially in the Bay Area are represented by a Democratic representative. Additionally, every Bay Area member of the California State Senate and the California State Assembly is a registered Democrat. The association between the Bay Area and progressive politics has led to the term \\"San Francisco values\\" being used by conservative commentators in a pejorative sense to describe the secular progressive culture in the area. ==Transportation== ACE, Amtrak, BART, Caltrain, Muni Metro, SMART, and VTA displayed here.alt=A transit map with lines depicting routes operated by various public rail agencies in the Bay Area. Transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area is reliant on a complex multimodal infrastructure consisting of roads, bridges, highways, rail, tunnels, airports, ferries, and bike and pedestrian paths. The development, maintenance, and operation of these different modes of transportation are overseen by various agencies, including the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. These and other organizations collectively manage several interstate highways and state routes, two subway networks, three commuter rail agencies, eight trans-bay bridges, transbay ferry service, local bus service, three international airports (San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland), and an extensive network of roads, tunnels, and paths such as the San Francisco Bay Trail. The Bay Area hosts an extensive freeway and highway system that is particularly prone to traffic congestion, with one study by Inrix concluding that the Bay Area's traffic was the fourth worst in the world. There are some city streets in San Francisco where gaps occur in the freeway system, partly the result of the Freeway Revolt, which prevented a freeway-only thoroughfare through San Francisco between the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, the western terminus of Interstate 80, and the southern terminus of the Golden Gate Bridge (U.S. Route 101). Additional damage that occurred in the wake of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake resulted in freeway segments being removed instead of being reinforced or rebuilt, leading to the revitalization of neighborhoods such as San Francisco's Embarcadero and Hayes Valley. The greater Bay Area contains the three principal north–south highways in California: Interstate 5, U.S. Route 101, and California State Route 1. U.S. 101 and State Route 1 directly serve the traditional nine-county region, while Interstate 5 bypasses to the east in San Joaquin County to provide a more direct Los Angeles–Sacramento route. Additional local highways connect the various subregions of the Bay Area together. There are over two dozen public transit agencies in the Bay Area with overlapping service areas that utilize different modes, with designated connection points between the various operators. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), a heavy rail/metro system, operates in five counties and connects San Francisco and Oakland via an underwater tube. Other commuter rail systems link San Francisco with the Peninsula and San Jose (Caltrain), San Jose with the Tri-Valley Area and San Joaquin County (ACE), and Sonoma with Marin County (SMART). In addition, Amtrak provides frequent commuter service between San Jose and the East Bay with Sacramento, and long-distance service to other parts of the United States. Muni Metro operates a hybrid streetcar/subway system within the city of San Francisco, and VTA operates a light rail system in Santa Clara County. These rail systems are supplemented by numerous bus agencies and transbay ferries such as Golden Gate Ferry and the San Francisco Bay Ferry. Most of these agencies accept the Clipper Card, a reloadable contactless smart card, as a universal electronic payment system. ==See also== * List of metropolitan areas of the United States * Coastal California * Statistical area (United States) * Lists of San Francisco Bay Area topics * Timeline of the San Francisco Bay Area ==References * Discover the Bay Area website run by Discover California * Bay Area Tourism Guide by the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce Category:Regions of California Category:Geography of Northern California Category:Metropolitan areas of California ","title":"San Francisco Bay Area"},{"id":"19283814","text":"The History of Belize dates back thousands of years. The Maya civilization spread into the area of Belize between 1500 BC to 1200 BC and flourished until about 1000 AD. Several Maya ruin sites, including Cahal Pech, Caracol, Lamanai, Lubaantun, Altun Ha, and Xunantunich reflect the advanced civilization and much denser population of that period. The first recorded European incursions in the region were made by Spanish conquistadors and missionaries in the 16th century, who nevertheless failed to establish colonial rule. English loggers and pirates sporadically visited the region in the 17th century, and the first English settlements were established around 1716. The 18th century in Belize was marked by frequent conflict between Britain and Spain and the arrival of enslaved Africans to British plantations. Belize was not formally termed the \\"Colony of British Honduras\\" until 1862. It became a crown colony in 1871. Subsequently, several constitutional changes were enacted to expand representative government. Internal Self-Government was granted in January 1964. The official name of the territory was changed from British Honduras to Belize in June 1973, and full independence was granted on 21 September 1981.\\"Background Note: Belize\\".

Many aspects of this culture persist in the area despite nearly 500 years of European domination. Prior to about 2500 B.C. some hunting and foraging bands settled in small farming villages; they domesticated crops such as corn, beans, squash, and chili peppers. A profusion of languages and subcultures developed within the Maya core culture. Between about 2500 B.C. and 250 A.D. the basic institutions of Maya civilization emerged. The peak of this civilization occurred during the classic period, which began around 250 A.D.Bolland, Nigel. \\"Belize: Historical Setting\\". In A Country Study: Belize (Tim Merrill, editor).

The inscriptions on the monuments there are in the Lowland Maya aristocratic tongue Classic Ch'olti'an. North of the Maya Mountains, the inscriptional language at Lamanai was Yucatecan as of 625 CE.Michael P. Closs, The Hieroglyphic Text of Stela 9, Lamanai, Belize, 13 from Closs, 1987 The last date recorded in Ch'olti'an within Belizean borders is 859 A.D. in Caracol, stele 10. Yucatec civilisation, in Lamanai, lasted longer. Farmers engaged in various types of agriculture, including labor-intensive irrigated and ridged- field systems and shifting slash-and-burn agriculture. Their products fed the civilization's craft specialists, merchants, warriors, and priest-astronomers, who coordinated agricultural and other seasonal activities with rituals in ceremonial centers. These priests, who observed the movements of the sun, moon, planets, and stars, developed a complex mathematical and calendrical system to coordinate various cycles of time and to record specific events on carved stelae. The Maya were skilled at making pottery, carving jade, knapping flint, and making elaborate costumes of feathers. the architecture of Maya civilization included temples and palatial residences organized in groups around plazas. These structures were built of cut stone, covered with stucco, and elaborately decorated and painted. Stylized carvings and paintings, along with sculptured stelae and geometric patterns on buildings, constitute a highly developed style of art. Belize boasts important sites of the earliest Maya settlements, majestic ruins of the classic period, and examples of late postclassic ceremonial construction. About five kilometers west of Orange Walk, is Cuello, a site from perhaps as early as 2,500 B.C. Jars, bowls, and other dishes found there are among the oldest pottery unearthed in present-day Mexico and Central America. Cerros, a site on Chetumal Bay, was a flourishing trade and ceremonial center between about 300 B.C. and 100 A.D. One of the finest carved jade objects of Maya civilization, the head of what is usually taken to be the sun god Kinich Ahau, was found in a tomb at the classic period site of Altún Ha, thirty kilometers northwest of present-day Belize City. Other Maya centers located in Belize include Xunantunich and Baking Pot in Cayo District, Lubaantún and Nimli Punit in Toledo District, and Lamanai on Hill Bank Lagoon in Orange Walk District. In the late classic period, it is estimated that between 400,000 and 1,000,000 people inhabited the area that is now Belize. People settled almost every part of the country worth cultivating, as well as the cay and coastal swamp regions. But in the 10th century, Maya society suffered a severe breakdown. Construction of public buildings ceased, the administrative centers lost power, and the population declined as social and economic systems lost their coherence. Some people continued to occupy, or perhaps reoccupied, sites such as Altun Ha, Xunantunich, and Lamanai. These sites ceased being ceremonial and civic centers. The decline of Maya civilization is still not fully explained. Rather than identifying the collapse as the result of a single factor, many archaeologists now believe that the decline of the Maya was a result of several complex factors and that the decline occurred at different times in different regions. ==Conquest and early colonial periodPre-Columbian Maya societies and the conquest=== Many Maya remained in Belize when the Europeans arrived in the 16th and 17th centuries. Archaeological and ethnohistorical research confirms that several groups of Maya peoples lived in the area now known as Belize in the 16th century. The political geography of that period does not coincide with present-day boundaries, so several Maya provinces lay across the frontiers of modern Belize, Mexico, and Guatemala. upright Spain soon sent expeditions to Guatemala and Honduras, and the conquest of Yucatán began in 1527. Though the Maya offered stiff resistance to Spanish \\"pacification\\", diseases contracted from the Spanish devastated the indigenous population and weakened its ability to resist conquest. In the 17th century, Spanish missionaries established churches in Maya settlements with the intention of converting and controlling these people. Piracy along the coast increased during this period. In 1642, and again in 1648, pirates sacked Salamanca de Bacalar, the seat of Spanish government in southern Yucatán. The abandonment of Bacalar ended Spanish control over the Maya provinces of Chetumal and Dzuluinicob. Bacalar was not refounded until 1729. Between 1638 and 1695, the Maya living in the area of Tipu enjoyed autonomy from Spanish rule. But in 1696, Spanish soldiers used Tipu as a base from which they pacified the area and supported missionary activities. In 1697 the Spanish conquered the Itzá, and in 1707, the Spanish forcibly resettled the inhabitants of Tipu to the area near Lake Petén Itzá. The political center of the Maya province of Dzuluinicob ceased to exist at the time that British colonists were becoming increasingly interested in settling the area. ===Colonial rivalry between Spain and Britain=== In the 16th and 17th centuries, Spain tried to maintain a monopoly on trade and colonization in its New World colonies, but northern European powers were increasingly attracted to the region by the potential for trade and settlement. These powers resorted to smuggling, piracy, and war in their efforts to challenge and then destroy Spain's monopoly. In the 17th century, the Dutch, English, and French encroached on Spain's New World possessions. Early in the 17th century, in southeastern Mexico and on the Yucatán Peninsula, English buccaneers began cutting logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum), which was used in the production of a textile dye. English buccaneers began using the coastline as a base from which to attack Spanish ships. Buccaneers stopped plundering Spanish logwood ships and started cutting their own wood in the 1650s and 1660s. However, buccaneers did not found permanent settlements. A 1667 treaty, in which the European powers agreed to suppress piracy, encouraged the shift from buccaneering to cutting logwood. The first British permanent settlement in nowadays Belize was founded in the late 1710s on Cayo Cosina, following the destruction by the Spanish of earlier British logging settlements in the Laguna de Términos region west of the Yucatán. During the winter of 1717–1718 the notorious pirate Blackbeard, aka Edward Teach, harassed shipping sailing to and from the port of Vera Cruz, Mexico while sailing in the Bay of Honduras. In April 1718, at Turneffe Atoll, Blackbeard captured the logwood cutting sloop Adventure and forced its captain David Herriot to join him. Blackbeard then made Israel Hands captain of the Adventure and began sailing for North Carolina. Conflict continued between Britain and Spain over the right of the British to cut logwood and to settle in the region. During the 18th century, the Spanish attacked the British settlers whenever the two powers were at war. The Spanish never settled in the region, however, and the British always returned to expand their trade and settlement. The 1763 Treaty of Paris conceded to Britain the right to cut logwood but asserted Spanish sovereignty over the territory. When war broke out again in 1779, the British settlement was abandoned until the Treaty of Versailles in 1783 allowed the British to again cut logwood in the area. By that time, however, the logwood trade had declined and Honduras Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) had become the chief export. ===Beginnings of self- government and Belize=== 1790 map of territory conceded by Spain to British settlers for cutting timber. The British were reluctant to set up any formal government for the settlement for fear of provoking the Spanish. On their own initiative, settlers had begun electing magistrates to establish common law as early as 1738. In 1765 these regulations were codified and expanded into Burnaby's Code. When the settlers began returning to the area in 1784, Colonel Edward Marcus Despard was named superintendent to oversee the Settlement of Belize in the Bay of Honduras. The 1786 Convention of London allowed the British settlers to cut and export timber but not to build fortifications, establish any form of government, or develop plantation agriculture. Spain retained sovereignty over the area. The last Spanish attack on the British settlement, the Battle of St. George's Caye, occurred two years after the outbreak of war in 1796. The British drove off the Spanish, thwarting Spain's last attempt to control the territory or dislodge other settlers. Despite treaties banning local government and plantation agriculture, both activities flourished. In the late 18th century, an oligarchy of relatively wealthy settlers controlled the political economy of the British settlement. These settlers claimed about four-fifths of the available land; owned about half of all slaves; controlled imports, exports, and the wholesale and retail trades; and determined taxation. A group of magistrates, whom they elected from among themselves, had executive as well as judicial functions. The landowners resisted any challenge to their growing political power. The situation changed when the Spanish territories around Belize became the new independent states of Mexico and the Federal Republic of Central America. In 1825 Mexico was officially recognized by Britain and in 1826 abandoned any claims over Belize. Shortly thereafter, the créole elite of Belize invented a legend to support an alleged British past: a Scottish buccaneer called Peter Wallace would have settled in the region as early as 1638 and given his name to the Belize River. ===Slavery in the settlement (1794–1838)=== 1831 map of Belize by Daniel Lizars The earliest reference to African slaves in the British settlement appeared in a 1724 Spanish missionary's account, which stated that the British recently had been importing them from Jamaica, Bermuda, and other Central American British Colonies. A century later, the total slave population numbered about 2,300. Most slaves were born in Africa, and many slaves at first maintained African ethnic identifications and cultural practices. Gradually, however, slaves assimilated and a new, synthetic Kriol culture was formed. Slavery in the settlement was associated with the extraction of timber, because treaties forbade the production of plantation crops. Settlers needed only one or two slaves to cut logwood, but as the trade shifted to mahogany in the last quarter of the 18th century, the settlers needed more money, land, and slaves for larger-scale operations. Other slaves worked as domestic helpers, sailors, blacksmiths, nurses, and bakers. The slaves' experience, though different from that on plantations in other colonies in the region, was nevertheless oppressive. They were frequently the objects of \\"extreme inhumanity\\", as a report published in 1820 stated. In the 18th century, many slaves escaped to Yucatán, and in the early 19th century a steady flow of runaways went to Guatemala and down the coast to Honduras. One way the settler minority maintained its control was by dividing the slaves from the growing population of free Kriol people who were given limited privileges. Though some Kriols were legally free, their economic activities and voting rights were restricted. Privileges, however, led many free blacks to stress their loyalty and acculturation to British ways. The act to abolish slavery throughout the British colonies, passed in 1833, was intended to avoid drastic social changes by effecting emancipation over a five-year transition period, by implementing a system of \\"apprenticeship\\" calculated to extend masters' control over the former slaves, and by compensating former slave owners for their loss of property. After 1838, the masters of the settlement continued to control the country for over a century by denying access to land and by limiting freedmen's economic freedom. ===Emigration of the Garifuna=== At the same time that the settlement was grappling with the ramifications of the end of slavery, a new ethnic group—the Garifuna—appeared. In the early 19th century, the Garifuna, descendants of Caribs of the Lesser Antilles and of Africans who had escaped from slavery, arrived in the settlement. The Garifuna had resisted British and French colonialism in the Lesser Antilles until they were defeated by the British in 1796. After putting down a violent Garifuna rebellion on Saint Vincent, the British moved between 1,700 and 5,000 of the Garifuna across the Caribbean to the Bay Islands (present-day Islas de la Bahía) off the north coast of Honduras. From there they migrated to the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, and the southern part of present-day Belize. By 1802 about 150 Garifuna had settled in the Stann Creek (present-day Dangriga) area and were engaged in fishing and farming. Other Garifuna later came to the British settlement of Belize after finding themselves on the wrong side in a civil war in Honduras in 1832. Many Garifuna men soon found wage work alongside slaves as mahogany cutters. In 1841 Dangriga, the Garifuna's largest settlement, was a flourishing village. The American traveler John Stephens described the Garifuna village of Punta Gorda as having 500 inhabitants and producing a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. The British treated Garifuna as squatters. In 1857 the British told the Garifuna that they must obtain leases from the crown or risk losing their lands, dwellings, and other buildings. The 1872 Crown Lands Ordinance established reservations for the Garifuna as well as the Maya. The British prevented both groups from owning land and treated them as a source of valuable labor. ===Constitutional developments (1850–62)=== In the 1850s, the power struggle between the superintendent and the planters coincided with events in international diplomacy to produce major constitutional changes. In the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850, Britain and the United States agreed to promote the construction of a canal across Central America and to refrain from colonizing any part of Central America. The British government interpreted the colonization clause as applying only to any future occupation. But the United States government claimed that Britain was obliged to evacuate the area, particularly after 1853, when President Franklin Pierce's expansionist administration stressed the Monroe Doctrine. Britain yielded on the Bay Islands and the Mosquito Coast in eastern Nicaragua. But in 1854, Britain produced a formal constitution establishing a legislative for its possession of the settlement in present-day Belize. The Legislative Assembly of 1854 was to have eighteen elected members, each of whom was to have at least £400 sterling worth of property. The assembly was also to have three official members appointed by the superintendent. The fact that voters had to have property yielding an income of £7 a year or a salary of a £100 a year reinforced the restrictive nature of this legislature. The superintendent could defer or dissolve the assembly at any time, originate legislation, and give or withhold consent to bills. This situation suggested that the legislature was more a chamber of debate than a place where decisions were made. The Colonial Office in London became, therefore, the real political- administrative power in the settlement. This shift in power was reinforced when in 1862, the Settlement of Belize in the Bay of Honduras was declared a British colony called British Honduras, and the crown's representative was elevated to a lieutenant governor, subordinate to the governor of Jamaica. Under the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850 between the United States and Britain, neither country was to undertake any control, colonization or occupation of any part of Central America, but it was unclear if it applied to Belize. In 1853, a new American government attempted to have Britain leave Belize. In 1856 the Dallas-Clarendon Treaty between the two governments recognized Belize territory as British. The Sarstoon River was recognized as the southern border with Guatemala. The Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty of 1859 was signed, setting the present-day western boundary and temporarily settling the question of Guatemala's claim on the territory. Only the northern border with Mexico was undefined. ==British Honduras (1862–1981)Maya immigration and conflict=== Maya fisherwomen in British Honduras, beginning of the 20th century. As the British consolidated their settlement and pushed deeper into the interior in search of mahogany in the late 18th century, they encountered resistance from the Maya. In the second half of the 19th century, however, a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the Maya. During the Caste War in Yucatán, a devastating struggle that halved the population of the area between 1847 and 1855, thousands of refugees fled to the British settlement. Though the Maya were not allowed to own land, most of the refugees were small farmers who were growing considerable quantities of crops by the mid-19th century. One group of Maya led by Marcos Canul attacked a mahogany camp on the Bravo River in 1866. A detachment of British troops sent to San Pedro was defeated by the Maya later that year. Early in 1867 British troops marched into areas in which the Maya had settled and destroyed villages in an attempt to drive them out. The Maya returned and in April 1870 Canul and his men occupied Corozal. An unsuccessful 1872 attack by the Maya on Orange Walk was the last serious attack on the British colony. Sarstoon Kekchi Mayan village In the 1880s and 1890s, Mopan and Kekchí Maya fled from forced labor in Guatemala and settled in several villages in southern British Honduras. Under the policy of indirect rule, a system of elected alcaldes (mayors) linked these Maya to the colonial administration. However, the remoteness of their settlements resulted in the Mopan and Kekchí Maya becoming less assimilated into the colony than the Maya of the north, where a Mestizo culture emerged. By the end of the 19th century, the ethnic pattern that remained largely intact throughout the 20th century was in place: Protestants largely of African descent, who spoke either English or Creole and lived in Belize Town; the Roman Catholic Maya and Mestizos who spoke Spanish and lived chiefly in the north and west; and the Roman Catholic Garifuna who spoke English, Spanish, or Garifuna and settled on the southern coast. ===Formal establishment of the colony (1862–71)=== The flag of British Honduras. Largely as a result of the costly military expeditions against the Maya, the expenses of administering the new colony of British Honduras increased, at a time when the economy was severely depressed. Great landowners and merchants dominated the Legislative Assembly, which controlled the colony's revenues and expenditures. Some of the landowners were also involved in commerce but their interest differed from the other merchants of Belize Town. The former group resisted the taxation of land and favored an increase in import duties; the latter preferred the opposite. Moreover, the merchants in the town felt relatively secure from Maya attacks and were unwilling to contribute toward the protection of mahogany camps, whereas the landowners felt that they should not be required to pay taxes on lands given inadequate protection. These conflicting interests produced a stalemate in the Legislative Assembly, which failed to authorize the raising of sufficient revenue. Unable to agree among themselves, the members of the Legislative Assembly surrendered their political privileges and asked for establishment of direct British rule in return for the greater security of crown colony status. The new constitution was inaugurated in April 1871 and the new legislature became the Legislative Council. Under the new constitution of 1871, the lieutenant governor and the Legislative Council, consisting of five ex officio or \\"official\\" and four appointed or \\"unofficial\\" members, governed British Honduras. This constitutional change confirmed and completed a change in the locus and form of power in the colony's political economy that had been evolving during the preceding half century. The change moved power from the old settler oligarchy to the boardrooms of British companies and to the Colonial Office in London. ===The colonial order (1871–1931)=== Men working in the mahogany industry, around 1930. The forestry industry's control of land and its influence in colonial decision-making slowed the development of agriculture and the diversification of the economy. Though British Honduras had vast areas of sparsely populated, unused land, landownership was controlled by a small European monopoly, thwarting the evolution of a Creole landowning class from the former slaves. There were some exceptions however, most notably, Isaiah Emmanuel Morter, who was the son of former slaves and accumulated a large landholdings of banana and coconut plantations. Landownership became even more consolidated during the economic depression of the mid-19th century. Major results of this depression included the decline of the old settler class, the increasing consolidation of capital, and the intensification of British landownership. The British Honduras Company (later the Belize Estate and Produce Company) emerged as the predominant landowner, with about half of all the privately held land in the colony. The new company was the chief force in British Honduras's political economy for over a century. This concentration and centralization of capital meant that the direction of the colony's economy was henceforth determined largely in London. It also signaled the eclipse of the old settler elite. By about 1890, most commerce in British Honduras was in the hands of a clique of Scottish and German merchants, most of them newcomers. The European minority exercised great influence in the colony's politics, partly because it was guaranteed representation on the wholly appointed Legislative Council. In 1892, the governor appointed several Creole members, but whites remained the majority. Despite the prevailing stagnation of the colony's economy and society during most of the century prior to the 1930s, seeds of change were being sown. The mahogany trade remained depressed, and efforts to develop plantation agriculture failed. A brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the United States. Exports of chicle, a gum taken from the sapodilla tree and used to make chewing gum, propped up the economy from the 1880s. A short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the United States, but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources. Creoles, who were well-connected with businesses in the United States, challenged the traditional political-economic connection with Britain as trade with the United States intensified. In 1927, Creole merchants and professionals replaced the representatives of British landowners (except for the manager of the Belize Estate and Produce Company) on the Legislative Council. The participation of this Creole elite in the political process was evidence of emerging social changes that were largely concealed by economic stagnation. An agreement between Mexico and Britain in 1893 set the boundary along the Rio Hondo, though the treaty was not finalized until 1897. ===Genesis of modern politics, 1931–54=== The Great Depression shattered the colony's economy, and unemployment increased rapidly. On top of this economic disaster, the worst hurricane in the country's recent history demolished Belize Town on 10 September 1931, killing more than 1,000 people. The British relief response was tardy and inadequate. The British government seized the opportunity to impose tighter control on the colony and endowed the governor with the power to enact laws in emergency situations. The Belize Estate and Produce Company survived the depression years because of its special connections in British Honduras and London. Meanwhile, workers in mahogany camps were treated almost like slaves. The law governing labor contracts, the Masters and Servants Act of 1883, made it a criminal offense for a laborer to breach a contract. In 1931 the governor, Sir John Burdon, rejected proposals to legalize trade unions and to introduce a minimum wage and sickness insurance. The poor responded in 1934 with a series of demonstrations, strikes, petitions, and riots that marked the beginning of modern politics and the independence movement. Riots, strikes, and rebellions had occurred before, but the events of the 1930s were modern labor disturbances in the sense that they gave rise to organizations with articulate industrial and political goals. Antonio Soberanis Gómez and his colleagues of the Labourers and Unemployed Association (LUA) attacked the governor and his officials, the rich merchants, and the Belize Estate and Produce Company, couching their demands in broad moral and political terms that began to define and develop a new nationalistic and democratic political culture. The labor agitation's most immediate success was the creation of relief work by a governor who saw it as a way to avoid civil disturbances. The movement's greatest achievements, however, were the labor reforms passed between 1941 and 1943. Trade unions were legalized in 1941, and a 1943 law removed breach-of-labor-contract from the criminal code. The General Workers' Union (GWU), registered in 1943, quickly expanded into a nationwide organization and provided crucial support for The Nationalist Movement (Belize) that took off with the formation of the People's United Party (PUP) in 1950. The 1930s were therefore the crucible of modern Belizean politics. It was a decade during which the old phenomena of exploitative labor conditions and authoritarian colonial and industrial relations began to give way to new labor and political processes and institutions. The same period saw an expansion in voter eligibility. In 1945 only 822 voters were registered in a population of over 63,000, but by 1954 British Honduras achieved suffrage for all literate adults. The introduction of credit unions and cooperatives after 1942, following the pioneering work of Marion M. Ganey, S.J., would gradually increase the economic and political power of the Maya and of the less affluent people in the country.Woods, Charles M. Sr., et al. Years of Grace: The History of Roman Catholic Evangelization in Belize: 1524–2014. (Belize: Roman Catholic Diocese of Belize City-Belmopan, 2015), 227ff. In December 1949, the governor devalued the British Honduras dollar in defiance of the Legislative Council, an act that precipitated Belize's independence movement. The governor's action angered the nationalists because it reflected the limits of the legislature and revealed the extent of the colonial administration's power. The devaluation enraged labor because it protected the interests of the big transnationals while subjecting the working class to higher prices for goods. Devaluation thus united labor, nationalists, and the Creole middle classes in opposition to the colonial administration. On the night that the governor declared the devaluation, the People's Committee was formed and the nascent independence movement suddenly matured. Between 1950 and 1954, the PUP, formed upon the dissolution of the People's Committee on 29 September 1950, consolidated its organization, established its popular base, and articulated its primary demands. By January 1950, the GWU and the People's Committee were holding joint public meetings and discussing issues such as devaluation, labor legislation, the proposed West Indies Federation, and constitutional reform. As political leaders took control of the union in the 1950s to use its strength, however, the union movement declined. The PUP concentrated on agitating for constitutional reforms, including universal adult suffrage without a literacy test, an all- elected Legislative Council, an Executive Council chosen by the leader of the majority party in the legislature, the introduction of a ministerial system, and the abolition of the governor's reserve powers. In short, PUP pushed for representative and responsible government. The colonial administration, alarmed by the growing support for the PUP, retaliated by attacking two of the party's chief public platforms, the Belize City Council and the PUP. In 1952 he comfortably topped the polls in Belize City Council elections. Within just two years, despite persecution and division, the PUP had become a powerful political force, and George Price had clearly become the party's leader. The colonial administration and the National Party, which consisted of loyalist members of the Legislative Council, portrayed the PUP as pro-Guatemalan and even communist. The leaders of the PUP, however, perceived British Honduras as belonging to neither Britain nor Guatemala. The governor and the National Party failed in their attempts to discredit the PUP on the issue of its contacts with Guatemala, which was then ruled by the democratic, reformist government of President Jacobo Arbenz. When voters went to the polls on 28 April 1954, in the first election under universal literate adult suffrage, the main issue was clearly colonialism—a vote for the PUP was a vote in favor of self-government. Almost 70 percent of the electorate voted. The PUP gained 66.3 percent of the vote and won eight of the nine elected seats in the new Legislative Assembly. Further constitutional reform was unequivocally on the agenda. ===Decolonization and the border dispute with Guatemala=== Belize (red) and Guatemala (blue). British Honduras faced two obstacles to independence: British reluctance until the early 1960s to allow citizens to govern themselves, and Guatemala's long-standing claim to the entire territory (Guatemala had repeatedly threatened to use force to take over British Honduras). By 1961, Britain was willing to let the colony become independent. Negotiations between Britain and Guatemala began again in 1961, but the elected representatives of British Honduras had no voice in these talks. George Price refused an invitation to make British Honduras an \\"associated state\\" of Guatemala, reiterating his goal of leading the colony to independence. In 1963 Guatemala broke off talks and ended diplomatic relations with Britain. Talks between Guatemala and British Honduras started and stopped abruptly during the late 1960s and early 1970s. From 1964 Britain controlled only British Honduran defense, foreign affairs, internal security, and the terms and conditions of the public service, and in 1973 the colony's name was changed to Belize in anticipation of independence. By 1975, the Belizean and British governments, frustrated at dealing with the military-dominated regimes in Guatemala, agreed on a new strategy that would take the case for self- determination to various international forums. The Belize government felt that by gaining international support, it could strengthen its position, weaken Guatemala's claims, and make it harder for Britain to make any concessions. Belize argued that Guatemala frustrated the country's legitimate aspirations to independence and that Guatemala was pushing an irrelevant claim and disguising its own colonial ambitions by trying to present the dispute as an effort to recover territory lost to a colonial power. Between 1975 and 1981, Belizean leaders stated their case for self-determination at a meeting of the heads of Commonwealth of Nations governments, the conference of ministers of the Nonaligned Movement, and at meetings of the United Nations (UN). Latin American governments initially supported Guatemala. Between 1975 and 1979, however, Belize won the support of Cuba, Mexico, Panama, and Nicaragua. Finally, in November 1980, with Guatemala completely isolated, the UN passed a resolution that demanded the independence of Belize. A last attempt was made to reach an agreement with Guatemala prior to the independence of Belize. The Belizean representatives to the talks made no concessions, and a proposal, called the Heads of Agreement, was initialed on 11 March 1981. However, when ultraright political forces in Guatemala labeled the proponents as sellouts, the Guatemalan government refused to ratify the agreement and withdrew from the negotiations. Meanwhile, the opposition in Belize engaged in violent demonstrations against the Heads of Agreement. A state of emergency was declared. However, the opposition could offer no real alternatives. With the prospect of independence celebrations in the offing, the opposition's morale fell. Independence came to Belize on 21 September 1981 after the Belize Act 1981, without reaching an agreement with Guatemala. == Independence == The flag of Belize, originally adopted in 1922. With Price at the helm, the PUP won all elections until 1984. In that election, first national election after independence, the PUP was defeated by the United Democratic Party (UDP), and UDP leader Manuel Esquivel replaced Price as prime minister. Price returned to power after elections in 1989. Guatemala's president formally recognized Belize's independence in 1992. The following year the United Kingdom announced that it would end its military involvement in Belize. All British soldiers were withdrawn in 1994, apart from a small contingent of troops who remained to train Belizean troops. The UDP regained power in the 1993 national election, and Esquivel became prime minister for a second time. Soon afterward Esquivel announced the suspension of a pact reached with Guatemala during Price's tenure, claiming Price had made too many concessions in order to gain Guatemalan recognition. The pact would have resolved a 130-year-old border dispute between the two countries. Border tensions continued into the early 21st century, although the two countries cooperated in other areas. The PUP won a landslide victory in the 1998 national elections, and PUP leader Said Musa was sworn in as prime minister. In the 2003 elections the PUP maintained its majority, and Musa continued as prime minister. He pledged to improve conditions in the underdeveloped and largely inaccessible southern part of Belize. the unrest in 2005. In 2005, Belize was the site of the unrest caused by discontent with the People's United Party government, including tax increases in the national budget. On 8 February 2008, Dean Barrow of the UDP was sworn in as Belize's first black prime minister. Throughout Belize's history, Guatemala has claimed ownership of all or part of the territory. This claim is occasionally reflected in maps showing Belize as Guatemala's twenty- third province. As of March 2007, the border dispute with Guatemala remains unresolved and quite contentious;Nation News 2006\\"ACP-EU summit 2000\\" at various times the issue has required mediation by the United Kingdom, Caribbean Community heads of Government, the Organisation of American States, and the United States. In December 2008, Belize and Guatemala signed an agreement to submit the territorial differences to the International Court of Justice, after referenda in both countries (which have not taken place as of March 2019).

It is one of four so-called \\"ironworks castles\\" built in the area during the 16th and early 17th centuries by owners of local iron-mining and -processing facilities, in what were then the clustered settlements of Plavž, Sava, Murova and Javornik, amalgamated into the town of Jesenice in 1929. The Bucellini-Ruard Manor in Sava is another survivor of the original four; the Plavž and Javornik manors have been torn down. The Kos manor was built in 1521 by Sigismund (Žiga) of Dietrichstein, a leaseholder of the Bucelleni family, owners of the Sava ironworks. It is located in what was then the heart of the Murova settlement, at the foot of the path leading to the Church of St. Leonard atop a small hill a few hundred metres away. The manor is mentioned in period documents as the \\"old belopeš castle,\\" in reference to the ancestral home of its builders the Bucelleni family, the village of Bela Peč (\\"White Furnace,\\" ), between Rateče and Tarvisio in present-day Italy.the Kos Manor at Burger.si It was also described in Valvasor's 1689 survey The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola. The manor obtained its current name in 1821, when its then-owner, the local merchant Frančišek Pavel Kos, enlarged and renovated it in neoclassical style. At some point thereafter it was acquired by the Ruard family, from whom it passed into the hands of the KID company in 1872, by then the sole operator of the local ironworks. Ten years later it was purchased by the Jesenice municipal government, initially for use as a public school, in which capacity it served from 1883-1915. In the interwar period the manor, by then commonly known as the \\"old school\\" (stara šola) was converted first into apartments and city offices and later into a courthouse and prison; it saw use as the latter during World War II as well, when the occupying Wehrmacht used the building as a transfer prison. Currently the manor is administered by the Upper Sava Museum Jesenice and serves various cultural and public functions:Upper Sava Museum web site *Ground floor: art gallery (with rotating exhibits), permanent exhibit \\"Occupation Terror of the Years 1941-1945\\" *First floor: permanent exhibit (since 1984) \\"The Workers' Movement and the National Liberation Struggle,\\" on the 19th and 20th century workers' movement and its connection to local partisan resistance against the German occupation *Second floor: multipurpose hall for municipal functions and cultural events, wedding hall ==See also== *Weissenfels Castle == References == Category:Houses completed in 1521 Category:Manors in Slovenia Category:Jesenice, Jesenice Category:History museums in Slovenia Category:Palaces in Slovenia Category:Art museums and galleries in Slovenia Category:1521 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire ","title":"Kos Manor"},{"id":"19283823","text":"Dickstein Shapiro LLP (formerly Dickstein, Shapiro, Morin & Oshinsky) was a large U.S. law firm and lobbying group based in Washington, D.C., with five offices across the United States. According to the National Law Journal's 2012 rankings, it was the 128th largest law firm in the United States. The firm also ranked 75th in profit per attorney on the 2012 AmLaw 200 survey. ==Practice areas== The firm was divided into six practice groups, each of which handle various aspects of their respective specialties: Complex Dispute resolution, Corporate & Finance, Government Law & Strategy (includes lobbying, political law, regulatory law and government contracts), Insurance coverage, Intellectual property, and Litigation. Pro Bono Dickstein Shapiro was recognized by the DC Bar for its leadership in pro bono representation. It was one of the law firms representing the detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. ==History== Dickstein Shapiro was founded by Sidney Dickstein and David I. Shapiro in New York City in 1953. By 1956, the firm moved its headquarters to Washington, DC. The firm quickly established its reputation by winning several high-profile cases, including Silver v. New York Stock Exchange before the United States Supreme Court. Over the following decades, the firm grew organically and through lateral hiring. In 2001, Dickstein Shapiro merged with Roberts, Sheridan & Kotel, a New York boutique firm that had spun off from Cravath, Swaine & Moore and which was primarily focused on corporate finance and tax law. In 2012, the firm entered into merger discussions with San Francisco-based international firm Pillsbury Winthrop, but those talks ended by early 2013. Dickstein Shapiro hired former Republican Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert as a lobbyist shortly after he resigned his seat in Congress. Hastert was later indicted in May 2015 on charges of illegally withdrawing money from banks to pay hush money to an individual that he committed misconduct against years ago. Hastert resigned his lobbyist position the day the indictment was unsealed. Hastert's biography was quickly removed from the firm's website, and the firm also purged all mentions of Hastert from its previously posted press releases. Hastert's resignation from Dickstein Shapiro following the indictment against him left the law firm and lobbying firm \\"reeling,\\" according to news reports. The firm's lobbying business had already been struggling; it was reported that the firm had billed $130,000 on behalf of eight clients for the first quarter of 2015, \\"not close to being on track for its overall 2014 billings, when it brought in $3.7 million for the year.\\" In the few years preceding the indictment, Dickstein Shapiro had already \\"faced an exodus of ... talent\\" to rival firms Greenberg Traurig and Cozen O'Connor, as well as \\"the loss of major client contracts\\" including Lorillard Tobacco Co., Peabody Energy Corp., Bayer Corp., and Covanta Energy Corp. Following the Hastert indictment, it was reported that Dickstein Shapiro's biggest domestic client, Fuels America, terminated its lobbying contract with the firm. In February 2016, it was announced that the firm would discontinue operation and that Blank Rome would hire approximately 100 of its lawyers.\\"Once-Mighty Dickstein Shapiro Closing Up Shop,\\" The Wall Street Journal, February 11, 2016 Equity partners are expected to lose all of their firm capital.\\"Dickstein Shapiro partners are informed their capital is gone; some could lose more than $1M,\\" ABA Journal, February 16, 2016 ==Offices== *Washington, D.C.

He was powerful early during the reign of Emperor Daizong and was feared by others, including chancellors. At the urging of the chancellor Yuan Zai, Emperor Daizong secretly executed him at a meeting in 770, although Emperor Daizong publicly claimed that he committed suicide. ==Background== Yu Chao'en was born in 722, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Lu Prefecture (瀘州, in modern Luzhou, Sichuan). Late in Emperor Xuanzong's Tianbao (742-756) era, Yu was an eunuch attached to the examination bureau of government (門下省, Menxia Sheng). It was said that he was intelligent and was capable both in publicly announcing imperial edicts and in accounting. ==During Emperor Suzong's reign== Early in the Zhide (756-758) era of Emperor Xuanzong's son and successor Emperor Suzong, during which Emperor Suzong was occupied with trying to suppress the rebel state Yan, Yu Chao'en was often commissioned to serve as a monitor of the armies, including serving as monitor of the army of Li Guangjin (李光進) during the recapturing of the capital Chang'an from Yan forces in 757. For his contributions to the campaign, he was put in charge of the eunuch bureau (內侍省, Neishi Sheng) and given a general title. Subsequently, after Tang forces recaptured the eastern capital Luoyang (which served as Yan's capital), forcing the Yan emperor An Qingxu to flee to Yecheng, nine Tang military governors (Jiedushi) put Yecheng under siege. The two most prominent generals of the nine were Guo Ziyi and Li Guangbi (Li Guangjin's brother), and as Emperor Suzong did not want to force one to submit to the command of the other, he did not commission a supreme commander; rather, he made Yu the monitor of the armies. It was said that Yu was jealous of Guo and often submitted reports criticizing Guo, but that Guo defused the tension by being humble with Yu. In 759, the Yan general Shi Siming, who had briefly submitted to Tang but then rose again against Tang, attacked Tang forces at Yecheng and, while not achieving a victory, caused the Tang forces to collapse by themselves. He subsequently killed An Qingxu and took over the Yan throne. Meanwhile, Yu blamed the collapse on Guo, and as a result, Li Guangbi was put in command of the armies. Shi Siming subsequently attacked Luoyang and captured it. After a failed attempt by Tang forces to capture Luoyang, instigated by Yu and opposed by Li Guangbi, Shi tried to attack west toward Chang'an, but was repelled by the general Wei Boyu (衛伯玉), who was under Yu's command, at Shan Prefecture (陝州, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). After a joint Tang and Huige army recaptured Luoyang in 762, Yu stationed his elite Shence Army to Bian Prefecture (汴州, in modern Kaifeng, Henan). For his contributions in this battle, he was created the Duke of Fengyi. Later in 762, he moved back to Shan Prefecture. ==During Emperor Daizong's reign== Also in 762, Emperor Suzong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Daizong. In 763, when the Tibetan Empire launched a sudden attack against Chang'an, Emperor Daizong was forced to flee to Shan Prefecture. When he fled, very few imperial guard soldiers accompanied him, and it was not until Yu Chao'en met him at Huayin (華陰, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) that he was protected by an army. Emperor Daizong gave Yu the title of monitor of troops over the entire realm (天下觀軍容宣慰處置使, Tianxia Guanjunrong Xuanwei Chuzhishi). After Emperor Xuanzong's return to Chang'an later in the year, Yu continued to be in command of the Shence Army and was greatly favored by Emperor Daizong, receiving much wealth. He was also permitted to enter and leave the palace as he wished. As the generals under his command continued to achieve important victories, particularly in the subsequent conflict against the rebellious general Pugu Huai'en, he considered himself capable in military command. As he considered himself learned in the Confucian classics as well and was capable of writing. In 765, during an attack by Pugu's forces, aligned with the Uyghur Khaganate and the Tibetan Empire, Yu tried to use his soldiers to coerce the imperial officials into concurring with moving the capital to Hezhong (河中, in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), but when an official named Liu publicly denounced the plan even with Yu's soldiers surrounding him, Yu abandoned the plan.That Yu wanted to move the capital to Hezhong was per the Zizhi Tongjian. The New Book of Tang indicated that he wanted to move the capital to Luoyang, while the Old Book of Tang did not discuss the incident at all. Compare Old Book of Tang, vol. 184 ; New Book of Tang, vol. 207 ; and Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 223. Also in 765, Yu, because he believed himself capable in literary matters, was made the acting principal of the imperial university (國子監, Guozijian). He was also created the Duke of Zheng. Under him, the imperial university, which had been destroyed during the An Lushan Rebellion, was rebuilt. In 766, when the university's construction was completed, Yu personally lectured about the I Ching, tried to satirize the chancellors by talking about how a ding (a large cooking vessel often used to symbolize chancellorship) would overturn if imbalanced. The chancellor Wang Jin, was visibly incensed, but the more powerful Yuan Zai remained calm and pleasant, leading Yu to comment, \\"It is common for the target to get angry, but one who remains smiling needs to be paid attention to even more carefully.\\"Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 224. Yuan, however, was secretly resentful. Yu continued to be the principal of the university until 768, despite opposition by the official Chang Gun that a eunuch should not head the university. In 767, Yu donated his mansion outside Chang'an to be rebuilt into a Buddhist temple dedicated to Emperor Daizong's deceased mother Consort Wu. As she was posthumously honored Empress Zhangjing, the temple was named Zhangjing Temple. The temple was said to be so luxuriously built that the wood in Chang'an was not enough, and several imperial pavilions had to be torn down so that the wood could be reused, and many officials and generals were required to donate their own houses for wood. In 768, he was created the Duke of Han. That year, at the anniversary of Consort Wu's death, Yu held a feast in her honor -- at which he openly talked about how the chancellors were incompetent and should yield their seats. The chancellors did not dare to respond, but the junior officials Xiangli Zao (相里造) and Li Kan (李衎) responded and rebuked Yu, causing him to be displeased and to adjourn the feast early. Late in the year, Guo Ziyi's father's tomb was opened by grave robbers, but it was commonly believed that, because Yu disliked Guo immensely, that he was responsible for instigating it, and thus, when Guo subsequently arrived in the capital, there was anticipation that Guo would react violently. Guo defused the tension by stating that his soldiers have themselves robbed many graves, and that this must have been divine retribution. In 769, when Emperor Daizong had Yu escort Guo on a tour of Zhangjing Temple, Yuan tried to exploit the tension between the two by having Guo's subordinates falsely warning Guo that Yu was set to kill him during the tour. Guo refused to take precautions and told Yu about the rumors, defusing the tension between the two. Meanwhile, several things caused Emperor Daizong to begin to be pleased with Yu. Yu was beginning to expect Emperor Daizong to accept every suggestion of his, and on one occasion, when Emperor Daizong did not, Yu stated, \\"Is there anything in this realm that I cannot decide?\\" Yu's young adoptive son Yu Linghui (魚令徽) was then serving as a eunuch inside the palace, and he wore the green robe for sixth and seventh rank officials. On an occasion, he had an argument with his colleagues, and he told Yu Chao'en about the argument. Yu Chao'en met Emperor Daizong the next day and stated, \\"My son's rank is too low, and his colleagues look down on him. Please let him wear a purple robe.A purple robe was for an official of the third rank or above. See the Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 54 [770].\\" Even before Emperor Daizong could respond, the officials nearby, following Yu Chao'en's cue, already brought out a purple robe and put it on Yu Linghui. Yu Linghui bowed to thank Emperor Daizong, who smiled and responded, \\"This child now has a purple robe. He should be happy.\\" However, he was internally displeased about how the incident went. Yuan saw that Emperor Daizong was becoming displeased with Yu, and therefore suggested to Emperor Daizong to eliminate Yu. They began to plot together. Yuan began to bribe two close associates of Yu's; Zhou Hao (周皓) the commander of the imperial guard archery corps, and Huangfu Wen (皇甫溫) the military governor of Shan Circuit (headquartered in modern Sanmenxia). Zhou and Huangfu became associates of Yuan's, and from this point on, Yuan and Emperor Daizong were able to anticipate Yu's moves. In spring 770, at Yuan's suggestion, Emperor Daizong carried out several moves that were intending to be preludes to eliminating Yu -- moving the general Li Baoyu from being the military governor (Jiedushi) of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji) to Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi, to the southwest of Chang'an), while moving Huangfu, then the military governor of Shan Circuit (headquartered in modern Sanmenxia) to Fengxiang -- while allaying Yu's suspicions by transferring control of four counties near Chang'an to the imperial guards, under Yu's command. (Yuan's intent was that, as Huangfu arrived in Chang'an, to use his soldiers against Yu.) Soon, when Huangfu arrived in Chang'an, Yuan laid a trap for Yu with Huangfu's and Zhou's soldiers, and at a secret meeting between Emperor Daizong and Yu, Yuan and Emperor Daizong acted and killed Yu. Emperor Daizong then issued a public rebuke of Yu and then claimed that, when Yu received the rebuke, he committed suicide. Emperor Daizong still had him buried with honors, at imperial expense. ==Notes and references== * Old Book of Tang, vol. 184. * New Book of Tang, vol. 207. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 220, 221, 222, 223, 224.

The United States. Poverty in the United States of America refers to people who lack sufficient income or material possessions for their needs. Although the United States is a relatively wealthy country by international standards, poverty has consistently been present throughout the United States, along with efforts to alleviate it, from New Deal-era legislation during the Great Depression to the national War on Poverty in the 1960s to poverty alleviation efforts during the 2008 Great Recession. The U.S. federal government uses two measures to measure poverty: the poverty thresholds set by the U.S. Census Bureau, used for statistical purposes, and the poverty guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, which are used for administrative purposes. Poverty thresholds, which recognize poverty as a lack of those goods and services which are commonly taken for granted by members of mainstream society, consist of income levels. On the other hand, poverty guidelines are simpler guidelines that are used to determine eligibility for federal programs such as Head Start and food stamps. According to a 2020 assessment by the U.S. Census Bureau, the percentage of Americans living in poverty for 2019 (before the pandemic) had fallen to some of lowest levels ever recorded due to the record-long economic growth period and stood at 11.1%. (adjusted for smaller response during the pandemic) However, between May and October 2020, the economic effects of the pandemic dragged some eight million people into poverty. ==Historical background Progressive era === Neighborhoods in Chicago color-coded by income, published in Hull House Maps and Papers Catalyzed by Henry George's 1873 book Progress and Poverty, public interest in how poverty could arise even in a time of economic progress arose in the 19th century with the rise of the Progressive movement. The Progressive American social survey began with the publication of Hull House Maps and Papers in 1895. This study included essays and maps collected by Florence Kelley and her colleagues working at Hull House and staff of the United States Bureau of Labor. It focused on studying the conditions of the slums in Chicago, including four maps color- coded by nationality and income level, which were based on Charles Booth's earlier pioneering work, Life and Labour of the People in London. Another social reformer, Jacob Riis, documented the living conditions of New York tenements and slums in his 1890 work How the Other Half Lives. === Great Depression === A group especially vulnerable to poverty consisted of poor sharecroppers and tenant farmers in the South. These farmers consisted of around a fourth of the South's population, and over a third of these people were African Americans. Historian James T. Patterson refers to these people as the \\"old poverty,\\" as opposed to the \\"new poverty\\" that emerged after the onset of the Great Depression. During the Depression, the government did not provide any unemployment insurance, so people who lost jobs easily became impoverished. People who lost their jobs or homes lived in shantytowns or Hoovervilles. Many New Deal programs were designed to increase employment and reduce poverty. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration specifically focused on creating jobs for alleviating poverty. Jobs were more expensive than direct cash payments (called \\"the dole\\"), but were psychologically more beneficial to the unemployed, who wanted any sort of job for morale. Other New Deal initiatives that aimed at job creation and wellbeing included the Civilian Conservation Corps and Public Works Administration. Additionally, the institution of Social Security was one of the largest factors that helped to reduce poverty.Poverty in 13 states is worse than we thought Washington Post November 8, 2013 === War on Poverty === A number of factors helped start the national War on Poverty in the 1960s. In 1962, Michael Harrington's book The Other America helped increase public debate and awareness of the poverty issue. The War on Poverty embraced expanding the federal government's roles in education and health care as poverty reduction strategies, and many of its programs were administered by the newly established Office of Economic Opportunity. The War on Poverty coincided with more methodological and precise statistical versions of studying poverty; the \\"official\\" U.S. statistical measure of poverty was only adopted in 1969. === 21st century === In the 21st century, the Great Recession helped to increase poverty levels again. , the number of people who were in poverty was approaching 1960s levels that led to the national War on Poverty.

The Census Bureau issues the poverty thresholds, which are generally used for statistical purposes—for example, to estimate the number of people in poverty nationwide each year and classify them by type of residence, race, and other social, economic, and demographic characteristics. The Department of Health and Human Services issues the poverty guidelines for administrative purposes—for instance, to determine whether a person or family is eligible for assistance through various federal programs. Both the poverty thresholds and poverty guidelines are updated yearly. More recently, the Census Bureau has begun using the Supplemental Poverty Measure as an additional statistic to measure poverty and supplement the existing measures. ===Poverty thresholds=== The poverty thresholds originate from work done by Mollie Orshansky, an American economist working for the Social Security Administration. Orshansky introduced the poverty thresholds in a 1963 Social Security Bulletin article, \\"Children of the Poor.\\" The \\"Basic Seven\\", a food plan developed by the United States Department of Agriculture. Orshansky based her thresholds on work she had done with the economy food plan while at the USDA. According to the USDA's 1955 Household Food Consumption Survey, families of three or more people spent one- third of their after-tax income on food. For these families, poverty thresholds were set at three times the cost of the economy food plan. Different procedures were used for calculating poverty thresholds for two- person households and persons living alone. Her work appeared at an opportune moment, as President Johnson declared the War on Poverty just six months later—and Orshanky's work offered a numerical way to measure progress in this effort. The newly formed Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) adopted the Orshansky poverty thresholds for statistical, planning, and budgetary purposes in May 1965. Officials at the OEO were enthusiastic; as research director Joseph Kershaw remarked, \\"Mollie Orshansky says that when you have more people in the family, you need more money. Isn't that sensible?\\" Officials at the Social Security Administration began to plan on how to adjust poverty thresholds for changes in the standard of living. The Bureau of the Budget resisted these changes, but formed an interagency committee that, in 1969, decided that poverty thresholds would be adjusted for inflation by being tied to the Consumer Price Index, rather than changes in the standard of living. In August 1969, the Bureau of the Budget designated these revised thresholds as the federal government's official definition of poverty. Apart from minor changes in 1981 that changed the number of thresholds from 124 to 48, poverty thresholds have remained static for the past fifty years despite criticism that the thresholds may not be completely accurate. Although the poverty thresholds assumes that the average household of three spends one-third of its budget on food, more recent surveys have shown that that number has decreased to one-fifth in the 1980s and one-sixth by the 1990s. If the poverty thresholds were recalculated based on food costs as of 2008, the economy food budget multiplier would have been 7.8 rather than 3, greatly increasing the thresholds.

They are useful because poverty thresholds for one calendar year are not published until the summer of the next calendar year; poverty guidelines, on the other hand, allow agencies to work with more timely data. Poverty guidelines were initially issued by the OEO starting in December 1965. After the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, responsibility for issuing the guidelines was transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. Poverty guidelines are also referred to as the \\"federal poverty level\\" (FPL), but the HHS discourages that term. === Supplemental Poverty Measure === In 1990, a Congressional committee requested the National Research Council (NRC) to conduct a study on revising the poverty measure. The NRC convened a panel, which published a 1995 report Measuring Poverty: A New Approach that concluded that the official poverty measure in the United States is flawed. The panel noted that the thresholds are the same irrespective of geography and stated that due to \\"rising living standards in the United States, most approaches for developing poverty thresholds (including the original one) would produce higher thresholds today than the current ones.\\" Additionally, the report suggested an alternative measure of poverty, which uses actual expenditure data to develop a threshold value for a family of four—and then update this threshold every year and according to geographic location. This alternative measure of poverty would also change the income calculation for a family, including certain non-cash benefits that satisfied \\"basic needs\\" such as food stamps and public housing while excluding \\"non-basic needs\\" such as medical costs and child care. The work of the panel led to the development of Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM), which was intended to address some of the weaknesses of the existing poverty guidelines. In October 2014, the Census Bureau released a report describing the SPM and stated its intention to publish SPM measures every year. However, SPM is intended to \\"supplement\\" the existing poverty thresholds, not \\"replace\\" them, as poverty thresholds will remain the \\"official\\" Census Bureau measure and poverty guidelines will be derived only from the \\"official\\" poverty measures. Unlike the poverty thresholds, and in line with the NRC recommendations, the SPM both includes certain non-cash benefits in a family's income and adjusts thresholds for differences in housing costs by geographic area. Additionally, the SPM thresholds are based on how much a \\"reference\\" family with two children spends on food, clothing, shelter, and utilities (FCSU). ===Criticism=== Understating poverty Many sociologists and government officials have argued that poverty in the United States is understated, meaning that there are more households living in actual poverty than there are households below the poverty threshold. A recentCitation needed NPR report states that as many as 30% of Americans have trouble making ends meet and other advocates have made supporting claims that the rate of actual poverty in the US is far higher than that calculated by using the poverty threshold. A study taken in 2012 estimated that roughly 38% of Americans live \\"paycheck to paycheck.\\" In 1969, the Bureau of Labor Statistics put forward suggested budgets for adequate family living. 60% of working-class Americans lived below the \\"intermediate\\" budget, which allowed for the following: > It assumes, for example, that the family will own: ... A toaster that will > last for 33 years. ... A vacuum cleaner that will last 14 years. The budget > assumes that a family will buy a two-year-old car and keep it for four > years... Finally, the budget allows nothing whatever for savings. Given that the \\"intermediate\\" budget was fairly modest, observers questioned whether poverty levels were really capturing the full extent of prosperity, challenging the long-established view that most Americans had attained an affluent standard of living in the two decades following the end of the Second World War. poor white southerners, Chicago, 1974 There have also been criticism of the methodology used to develop the U.S. poverty thresholds in the first place. As noted above, the poverty thresholds used by the US government were originally developed during the Johnson administration's War on Poverty initiative in the early 1960s. The thresholds were based on the cost of a food basket at the time, multiplied by three, under the assumption that the average family spent one third of its income on food. However, the current poverty line only takes into account food purchases that were common more than 50 years ago. Additionally, it assumes that Americans spend one third of their income on food; in fact, Americans typically spent less than one tenth of their after-tax income on food in 2000. For many families, the costs of housing, health insurance and medical care, transportation, and access to basic telecommunications take a much larger bite out of the family's income today than a half century ago, yet none of these costs are considered in determining the official poverty thresholds. According to John Schwarz, a political scientist at the University of Arizona: > The official poverty line today is essentially what it takes in today's > dollars, adjusted for inflation, to purchase the same poverty-line level of > living that was appropriate to a half century ago, in 1955 .... Updated > thereafter only for inflation, the poverty line lost all connection over > time with current consumption patterns of the average family. Quite a few > families then didn't have their own private telephone, or a car, or even a > mixer in their kitchen... The official poverty line has thus been allowed to > fall substantially below a socially decent minimum, even though its > intention was to measure such a minimum. The issue of understating poverty is especially pressing in states with both a high cost of living and a high poverty rate such as California where the median home price Homeless man in Bostonin 2006 was $564,430. In the Monterey area, where the low-pay industry of agriculture is the largest sector in the economy and the majority of the population lacks a college education, the median home price was $723,790, requiring an upper middle class income only earned by roughly 20% of all households in the county. Such fluctuations in local markets are, however, not considered in the federal poverty threshold and may leave many who live in poverty-like conditions out of the total number of households classified as poor. The Supplemental Poverty Measure, introduced in 2011, aims at providing a more accurate picture of the true extent of poverty in the United States by taking account of non-cash benefits and geographic variations. According to this new measure, 16% of Americans lived in poverty in 2011, compared with the official figure of 15.2%. With the new measure, one study estimated that nearly half of all Americans lived within 200% of the federal poverty line. According to American economist Sandy Darity, Jr., \\"There is no exact way of measuring poverty. The measures are contingent on how we conceive of and define poverty. Efforts to develop more refined measures have been dominated by researchers who intentionally want to provide estimates that reduce the magnitude of poverty.\\" Overstating poverty Youth play in Chicago's Stateway Gardens high-rise housing project in 1973. Some critics assert that the official U.S. poverty definition is inconsistent with how it is defined by its own citizens and the rest of the world, because the U.S. government considers many citizens statistically impoverished despite their ability to sufficiently meet their basic needs. According to a 2011 paper by The Heritage Foundation research fellow Robert Rector, of the 43.6 million Americans deemed by the U.S. Census Bureau to be below the poverty level in 2009, the majority had adequate shelter, food, clothing and medical care. Left-leaning sources disputed the report's findings.Jonathan Rothwell (November 8, 2011). Why Heritage Is Wrong About Poverty in America.

In addition, the paper stated that those assessed as below the poverty line in 2011 have a much higher quality of living than those who were identified by the census 40 years ago as being in poverty. For example, in 2005, 63.7% of those living in poverty had cable or satellite television. In some cases the report even said that people currently living in poverty were actually better off than middle class people of the recent past. For example, in 2005, 78.3% of households living in poverty had air conditioning, whereas in 1970, 36.0% of all households had air conditioning. According to The Heritage Foundation, the federal poverty line also excludes income other than cash income, especially welfare benefits. Thus, if food stamps and public housing were successfully raising the standard of living for poverty stricken individuals, then the poverty line figures would not shift, since they do not consider the income equivalents of such entitlements.Poor Poverty Yardsticks by Rea Hederman, Heritage Foundation, Washington Post.

(receiving fewer than 1,800 calories per day). In 2012, 16.1 million American children were living in poverty. Outside of the 49 million Americans living in food insecure homes, 15.9 million of them were children. In 2013, child poverty reached record high levels in the U.S., with 16.7 million children living in food insecure households. Many of the neighborhoods these children live in lack basic produce and nutritious food. 47 million Americans depend on food banks, more than 30% above 2007 levels. Households headed by single mothers are most likely to be affected. 30 percent of low-income single mothers cannot afford diapers. Inability to afford this necessity can cause a chain reaction, including mental, health, and behavioral problems. Some women are forced to make use of one or two diapers, using them more than once. This causes rashes and sanitation problems as well as health problems. Without diapers, children are unable to enter into daycare. The lack of childcare can be detrimental to single mothers, hindering their ability to obtain employment. Worst affected are Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Florida, and the District of Columbia, while North Dakota, New Hampshire, Virginia, Minnesota and Massachusetts are the least affected. 31 million low-income children received free or reduced-price meals daily through the National School lunch program during the 2012 federal fiscal year. Nearly 14 million children are estimated to be served by Feeding America with over 3 million being of the ages of 5 and under. A 2014 report by the National Center on Family Homelessness states the number of homeless children in the U.S. has reached record levels, calculating that 2.5 million children, or one child in every 30, experienced homelessness in 2013. High levels of poverty, lack of affordable housing and domestic violence were cited as the primary causes.David Crary and Lisa Leff (November 17, 2014). New Report: Child Homelessness on the Rise in US. The Associated Press. Retrieved November 17, 2014. A 2017 peer-reviewed study published in Health Affairs found that the U.S. has the highest levels of child mortality among 20 OECD countries. Poverty is also associated with expanded adverse childhood experiences, such as witnessing violence, feeling discrimination, and experiencing bullying.Cronholm PF, Forke CM, Wade R, Bair-Merritt MH, Davis M, Harkins-Schwarz M, Pachter LM, Fein JA. Adverse Childhood Experiences: Expanding the concept of adversity. American Journal of Preventive Medicine. 2015 Sep;49(3):354-61 According to a 2016 study by the Urban Institute, teenagers in low income communities are often forced to join gangs, save school lunches, sell drugs or exchange sexual favors because they cannot afford food.US teens often forced to trade sex work for food, study finds. The Guardian. September 12, 2016. ==Effects of poverty== Access to selected courses in US public schools by poverty level in the 2015–16 school year === Education === Poverty affects individual access to quality education. The U.S. education system is often funded by local communities; therefore the quality of materials and teachers can reflect the affluence of community. That said, many communities address this by supplementing these areas with funds from other districts. Low income communities are often not able to afford the quality education that high income communities do which results in a cycle of poverty.

Incarceration and social inequality. Daedalus, 139(3), 8-19 The vast majority living in poverty is uneducated people that end up increasing more unemployment and crime. ==Factors in poverty== Rust Belt ruins of former factory, Detroit, Michigan There are numerous factors related to poverty in the United States. *Income has a high correlation with educational levels. In 2007, the median earnings of household headed by individuals with less than a 9th grade education was $20,805 while households headed by high school graduates earned $40,456, households headed by holders of bachelor's degrees earned $77,605, and families headed by individuals with professional degrees earned $100,000. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen stated in 2014: \\"Public funding of education is another way that governments can help offset the advantages some households have in resources available for children. One of the most consequential examples is early childhood education. Research shows that children from lower-income households who get good-quality pre- Kindergarten education are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college as well as hold a job and have higher earnings, and they are less likely to be incarcerated or receive public assistance.\\" *In many cases poverty is caused by job loss. In 2007, the poverty rate was 21.5% for individuals who were unemployed, but only 2.5% for individuals who were employed full-time. *In 1991, 8.3% of children in two-parent families were likely to live in poverty; 19.6% of children lived with a father in a single parent family; and 47.1% in a single parent family headed by a mother. *Income levels vary with age. For example, the median 2009 income for households headed by individuals age 15–24 was only $30,750, but increased to $50,188 for household headed by individuals age 25–34 and $61,083 for household headed by individuals 35–44. Work experience and additional education may be factors.Wealth inequality in the United States increased from 1989 to 2013. *Income levels vary along racial/ethnic lines: 21% of all children in the United States live in poverty, about 46% of black children and 40% of Latino children.Center for the Future of Children, The Future of Children. Vol. 7, No 2, 1997. The poverty rate is 9.9% for black married couples, and only 30% of black children are born to married couples (see Marriage below). The poverty rate for native born and naturalized whites is identical (9.6%). On the other hand, the poverty rate for naturalized blacks is 11.8% compared to 25.1% for native born blacks, suggesting race alone does not explain income disparity. Not all minorities have low incomes. Asian families have higher incomes than all other ethnic groups. For example, the 2005 median income of Asian families was $68,957 compared to the median income of white families of $59,124. Asians, however, report discrimination occurrences more frequently than blacks. Specifically, 31% of Asians reported employment discrimination compared to 26% of blacks in 2005.Amy Joyce, \\"The Bias Breakdown,\\" The Washington Post, December 9, 2005, p. D01 citing Gallop Poll data. *Policies that address income and wealth inequality (i.e., policies that transfer money from higher-income and more wealthy families to less wealthy families) bear significantly on poverty. Economist Jared Bernstein and Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute suggest that poverty could have decreased significantly if inequality had not increased over the last few decades.Jared Bernstein (January 13, 2014). Poverty and Inequality, in Charts. The New York Times Retrieved September 20, 2014.Elise Gould (January 15, 2014). No Matter How We Measure Poverty, the Poverty Rate Would Be Much Lower If Economic Growth Were More Broadly Shared. Economic Policy Institute. Retrieved September 20, 2014. Economist Larry Summers estimated that at 1979 levels of income inequality, the bottom 80% of families would have an average of $11,000 more per year in income in 2014. *The relationship between tax rates and poverty is disputed. A study comparing high tax Scandinavian countries with the U. S. suggests high tax rates are inversely correlated with poverty rates. The poverty rate, however, is low in some low tax countries like Switzerland. A comparison of poverty rates between states reveals that some low tax states have low poverty rates. For example, New Hampshire has the lowest poverty rate of any state in the U. S., and has very low taxes (46th among all states). It is true however that both Switzerland and New Hampshire have a very high household income and other measures offsetting the lack of taxation. For example, Switzerland has Universal Healthcare and a free system of education for children as young as four years old.The Swiss education system swissworld.org, Retrieved on June 23, 2009 New Hampshire has no state income tax or sales tax, but does have the nation's highest property taxes.incarceration in the United States by year *The poor in the United States are incarcerated at a much higher rate than their counterparts in other developed nations, with penal confinement being, according to sociologist Bruce Western, \\"commonplace for poor men of working age.\\" A 2015 study by the Vera Institute of Justice contends that jails in the U.S. have become \\"massive warehouses\\" of the impoverished since the 1980s.Tom Hall (February 13, 2015).Study says US jails have become \\"massive warehouses\\" for the poor. World Socialist Web Site. Retrieved February 15, 2015. Scholars assert that the transformation of the already anemic U.S. welfare state to a post-welfare punitive state, along with neoliberal structural adjustment policies, the globalization of the U.S. economy and the dominance of global financial institutions, have created more extreme forms of \\"destitute poverty\\" in the U.S. which must be contained by expanding the criminal justice system and the carceral state into every aspect of the lives of the poor, which, according to Reuben Jonathan Miller and Emily Shayman, has resulted in \\"transforming what it means to be poor in America.\\" *According to the American Enterprise Institute, research has shown that income and intelligence are related. In a 1998 study, Charles Murray compared the earnings of 733 full sibling pairs with differing intelligence quotients (IQs). He referred to the sample as utopian in that the sampled pairs were raised in families with virtually no illegitimacy, divorce or poverty. The average earnings of sampled individuals with an IQ of under 75 was $11,000, compared to $16,000 for those with an IQ between 75 and 90, $23,000 for those with an IQ between 90 and 110, $27,000 for those with an IQ between 110 and 125, and $38,000 for those with an IQ above 125.Charles Murray (1998).

The SPLC, April 22, 2017. *According to a 2017 academic study by MIT economist Peter Temin, Americans trapped in poverty live in conditions rivaling the developing world, and are forced to contend with substandard education, dilapidated housing, and few stable employment opportunities. A 2017 study published in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene found that hookworm, a parasite that thrives on extreme poverty, is flourishing in the Deep South. A report on the study in The Guardian stated: ** *Some 12 million Americans live with diseases associated with extreme poverty. ==Fighting poverty== There have been many governmental and nongovernmental efforts to reduce poverty and its effects. These range in scope from neighborhood efforts to campaigns with a national focus. They target specific groups affected by poverty such as children, people who are autistic, immigrants, or people who are homeless. Efforts to alleviate poverty use a disparate set of methods, such as advocacy, education, social work, legislation, direct service or charity, and community organizing. Recent debates have centered on the need for policies that focus on both \\"income poverty\\" and \\"asset poverty.\\" Advocates for the approach argue that traditional governmental poverty policies focus solely on supplementing the income of the poor through programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF, formerly Aid to Families with Dependent Children, AFDC) and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp Program). According to the CFED 2012 Assets & Opportunity Scorecard, 27 percent of households – nearly double the percentage that are income poor – are living in \\"asset poverty.\\" These families do not have the savings or other assets to cover basic expenses (equivalent to what could be purchased with a poverty level income) for three months if a layoff or other emergency leads to loss of income. Since 2009, the number of asset poor families has increased by 21 percent from about one in five families to one in four families. In order to provide assistance to such asset poor families, Congress appropriated $24 million to administer the Assets for Independence Program under the supervision of the US Department for Health and Human Services. The program enables community-based nonprofits and government agencies to implement Individual Development Account or IDA programs, which are an asset-based development initiative. Every dollar accumulated in IDA savings is matched by federal and non-federal funds to enable households to add to their assets portfolio by buying their first home, acquiring a post-secondary education, or starting or expanding a small business. Additionally, the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC or EIC) is a credit for people who earn low-to-moderate incomes. This credit allows them to get money from the government if their total tax outlay is less than the total credit earned, meaning it is not just a reduction in total tax paid but can also bring new income to the household. The Earned Income Tax Credit is viewed as the largest poverty reduction program in the United States. There is an ongoing debate in the U.S. about what the most effective way to fight poverty is, through the tax code with the EITC, or through the minimum wage laws. Government safety-net programs put in place since the War on Poverty have helped reduce the poverty rate from 26% in 1967 to 16% in 2012, according to a Supplemental Poverty Model (SPM) created by Columbia University, while the official U.S. Poverty Rate has not changed, as the economy by itself has done little to reduce poverty. According to the 2013 Columbia University study which created the (SPM) method of measuring poverty, without such programs the poverty rate would be 29% today.Zachary A. Goldfarb (December 9, 2013). Study: U.S. poverty rate decreased over past half-century thanks to safety-net programs. The Washington Post. Retrieved January 20, 2015. An analysis of the study by Kevin Drum suggests the American welfare state effectively reduces poverty among the elderly but provides relatively little assistance to the working-age poor.Drum, Kevin (December 9, 2013).

A 2014 study by Pew Charitable Trusts shows that without social programs like food stamps, social security and the federal EITC, the poverty rate in the U.S. would be much higher.Jana Kasperkevic (November 12, 2014). Welfare programs shown to reduce poverty in America. The Guardian. Retrieved December 27, 2014.

There is the absence of a cheerful behavior, and its expression is almost entirely nonverbal. These manifestations include: * refusing to eat, work, or play * being unusually quiet * simply keeping to one's self * withdrawing from the group * resisting expressions of affection * locking one's self in his or her room * not joining friends in group activities * not talking to the person concerned, or to people in general These are usually efforts to get the offending party to go away, and if these behaviors do not work, the person with sumpong might choose to escalate them - foot stomping, door slamming, and shouting, for example. Compare Prices and Read Reviews on Culture Shock!: Philippines at Epinions.com ==Cultural reason for Sumpong== While these external manifestations may indeed sound like a temperament or mood problem in the western sense, the underlying cultural reason for them is what sets sumpong apart. While tantrums and moodiness have strong negative connotations in western countries, sumpong is understandable among Filipinos.http://www.sito.org/cgi- bin/egads/showart?show=jaf.0032&idonly;=JAF In fact, sumpong has positive connotations for the Filipino aside from the obvious negatives ones. Having sumpong is a manifestation of being able to feel and not being too passive. Like tampo, the cultural behavior sumpong roots from the nonconfrontational nature of Filipino culture. That is to say, it is a way of expressing hurt feelings in a culture where the direct expression of anger or resentment is discouraged. The withdrawal behaviors in sumpong are indirect ways of expressing hostility or resentment. It can also be seen as a way by which Filipinos \\"save face,\\" as direct confrontation is usually a threat to \\"smooth interpersonal relationships\\" (SIR), which is a deeply valued in Philippine society.Philippines - Social Values And Organization == Dealing with sumpong == The basic expectation of one who meets a person with sumpong is to go away or to refrain from jesting with the person. One way of dealing with a person with sumpong is to respond to the person with the mood problem with friendly overtures or expressions of concern. Not to do this may, however, cause spontaneous healing (\\"nawala na ang sumpong\\") after a short \\"cooling off\\" period. In most cases of sumpong, healing the inner, emotional relationship between two people is usually more critical than resolving the issue itself. == Related cultural traits == Like other Asians, Filipinos believe strongly in tampo and in saving face. This is why, in response to an invitation, when a Filipino says yes, it might mean “yes”, but could mean “maybe”, or even “I don’t know.” It is often difficult for Filipinos to bring themselves to say no, and it is a good idea to confirm a dinner invitation several times to ensure that they did not say yes because they could not find a proper way to say no. Also tied to saving face are amor propio, which means self-respect; and hiya, which means shame. A Filipino would be thought of as lacking amor propio if, for example, they accepted criticism weakly or did not offer honored guests the proper hospitality. Hiya is felt by those whose actions are seen as socially unacceptable, and one of the ultimate insults in Philippine society is to be labeled walang-hiya, which roughly translates to being shameless. Everyone is expected to have hiya, and to win the respect of others by conforming to community norms. == Term usage == * May sumpong - the person has, currently, a temperament problem that may last for a while * Sinusumpong - present participle form, or the person is currently not in good mood and doing tantrums * Sinusumpong ng (asthma, or any other illness) - the person is not in good mood because of a recurring illness, say, asthma or any other illness. * Susumpungin - future tense of the word, usually an affectionate threat. * Sumpungan - meet the person head-on * Sumpungin - (accent on the second syllable) a humorous adjective that refers to frequent moodiness or temperament problems. * Pasumpong-sumpong - a disease or an illness, such as allergy, that happens once in a while and quite unpredictable == References  * http://www.sawikaan.net/kartilya_ng_wikang_filipino.html * \\"May Sumpong\\" in http://www.sito.org/cgi- bin/egads/showart?show=jaf.0032&idonly;=jaf&seq;=0 * \\"Sumpong\\" in http://filsg.com/smf/index.php?topic=1552.0 * \\"May sumpong si Sean\\" in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv8aj9uT4MA Category:Philippine culture Category:Philippine society Category:Tagalog words and phrases ","title":"Sumpong"},{"id":"19283944","text":"After the fall of Tiwanaku Empire, the many Aymara Lake Titicaca were conquered by the Inca Empire. Prior to the Spanish conquest, the Andean province of Qullasuyu was a part of the Inca empire, while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent nomadic tribes. Spanish conquistadors, arriving from Cuzco and Asunción took control of the region in the 16th century. During most of the Spanish colonial rule, Bolivia was known as Upper Peru and administered by the Royal Audiencia of Charcas. After the 1st call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Bolivian Republic, named for the Liberator Simón Bolívar, on 6 August 1825. Since then Bolivia has endured regular periods of political and economic instability, including the loss of various provinces to its neighbors, such as Acre, parts of the Gran Chaco and its Pacific coast, making it a land-locked country. ==Pre-Columbian period== Cultures of indigenous peoples in Bolivia developed in the high altitude settings of altiplano with low oxygen levels, poor soils and extreme weather patterns. The better suited lowlands were sparsely inhabited by hunter-gatherer societies while much of the pre-Columbian population was concentrated in altiplano valleys of Cochabamba and Chuquisaca. Potato was domesticated near lake Titicaca between 8000 and 5000 BC, quinoa some 3000–4000 years ago and production of copper began in 2000 BC. Llama, alpaca and vicuña were domesticated and used for transport, food and clothing. Aymara people arrived in the region some 2000 years ago, eventually settling in Western Bolivia, Southern Peru and Northern Chile. Present-day Aymaras associate themselves with the advanced culture of Tiwanaku, which after 600 became an important regional power. According to early estimates, at its maximum extent, the city covered approximately 6.5 square kilometers, and had between 15,000 - 30,000 inhabitants.Kolata, Alan L. 'The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization'. Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, 1993. p. 145 However, satellite imaging was used recently to map the extent of \\"flooded-raised fields\\" (suka qullu) across the three primary valleys of Tiwanaku, arriving at population-carrying capacity estimates of anywhere between 285,000 and 1,482,000 people.Kolata, Alan L. Valley of the Spirits: A Journey into the Lost Realm of the Aymara. John Willy and Sons, Hoboken, 1996. William H. Isbell states that \\"Tiahuanaco underwent a dramatic transformation between AD 600 and 700 that established new monumental standards for civic architecture and greatly increased the resident population.\\"Isbell, William H. 'Wari and Tiwanaku: International Identities in the Central Andean Middle Horizon'. 731–751. Tiwanaku gained its power through the trade it implemented between all of the cities within its empire.McAndrews, Timothy L. et al. \\"Regional Settlement Patterns in the Tiwanaku Valley of Bolivia\\". Journal of Field Archaeology 24 (1997): 67–83. After 950 a dramatic shift in climate occurred and there was a significant drop in precipitation for the Titicaca Basin.Kolata, Alan L. 'The Tiwankau: Portrait of an Andean Civilization'. Blackwell Publishers, Cambridge, 1993. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1150 because food production collapses and could no longer sustain the large population. The land was not inhabited for many years after that. Between 1438 and 1527 the Inca empire embarked on a mass expansion, acquiring much of what is now western Bolivia under their 9th emperor, Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui, whose reign lasted from 1438 to 1471. Pachacuti Yupanqui was succeeded by his son, Topa Inca Yupanqui whose reign also increased the Incan territory and lasted from 1471 to 1493. During the 15th century, the Incas conquered the region of Lake Titicaca and western Bolivia became a part of the Inca territory as province of Qullasuyu. == Spanish colonial period  Conquest by Spain === Inca expansion (1438–1533 CE) Francisco Pizarro, Diego de Almagro, and Hernando de Luque led the Spanish discovery and conquest of the Inca empire. They first sailed south in 1524 along the Pacific coast from Panama to confirm the existence of a legendary land of gold called \\"Biru\\" (later altered to Peru). Because the rapidly expanding Inca Empire was internally weak, the conquest was remarkably easy. After the Inca Emperor Huayna Capac died in 1527, his sons Huascar and Atahualpa fought over the succession. Although Atahualpa defeated his brother, he had not yet consolidated his power when the conquistadors arrived. Atahualpa did not attempt to defeat Pizarro when he arrived on the coast in 1532 because the Incan ruler was convinced that those who commanded the mountains also controlled the coast. Atahualpa's refusal to accept the permanent Spanish presence and to convert to Christianity led to the bloody Battle of Cajamarca on 16 November 1532. Pizarro killed Atahualpa's 12-man honor guard and took the Inca captive at the so-called ransom room. One year later, the Inca capital of Cuzco fell and was refounded as a new Spanish settlement. Francisco Pizarro Despite Pizarro's quick victory, Inca rebellions soon began and continued periodically throughout the colonial period. In 1537 Manco Inca, whom the Spanish had established as a puppet emperor, rebelled against the new rulers and restored a \\"neo-Inca\\" state. This state continued to challenge Spanish authority even after the Spanish suppressed the revolt and beheaded Túpac Amaru in the public square of Cuzco in 1572. Later revolts in the Bolivian highlands were usually organized by the elders of the community and remained local in nature, except for the great rebellion of Túpac Amaru II. During the first two decades of Spanish rule, the settlement of the Bolivian highlands — now known as Upper Peru (Alto Peru) or Real Audiencia of Charcas — was delayed by a civil war between the forces of Pizarro and Diego de Almagro. The two conquistadors had divided the Incan territory, with the north under the control of Pizarro and the south under that of Almagro. Fighting broke out in 1537 when Almagro seized Cuzco after suppressing the Manco Inca rebellion. Pizarro defeated and executed Almagro in 1538, but was himself assassinated three years later by former supporters of Almagro. Pizarro's brother Gonzalo assumed control of Upper Peru but soon became embroiled in a rebellion against the Spanish crown. Only with the execution of Gonzalo Pizarro in 1548 did the Spanish crown succeed in reasserting its authority; later that year colonial authorities established the city of La Paz, which soon became an important commercial center. The conquest and colonial rule were traumatic experiences for the indigenous peoples in Bolivia. Easily susceptible to European diseases, the native population decreased rapidly. However, the resistance of indigenous people of the Bolivian lowlands managed to delay the conquest and settlement of their lands. The Spanish established Sa Sierra in 1561, but the Gran Ce (the colonial name for the arid Chaco region) remained a wild frontier throughout colonial rule. In the Chaco, the Native Americans, mostly Chiriguano, carried out unrelenting attacks against colonial settlements and remained independent of direct Spanish control. === Spanish administration === The Cerro Rico, from which the Spanish drew most of their silver During most of the Spanish colonial period, this territory was under the authority of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Local government was implemented by the Real Audiencia of Charcas, located in Chuquisaca or La Plata (modern Sucre). Bolivian silver mines produced much of the Spanish Empires wealth, and Potosí, site of the famed Cerro Rico (\\"Rich Mountain\\") was for a couple of centuries the largest city in the Western Hemisphere. The wealth of Upper Peru and its remoteness from Lima convinced the authorities to create a new audiencia in the city of Chuquisaca (present-day Sucre) in 1558. Chuquisaca had become particularly important as Potosí's administrative and agricultural supply center. The jurisdiction of the audiencia, known as Charcas, initially covered a radius of 100 leagues (1,796 km²) around Chuquisaca, but it soon included Santa Cruz and territory belonging to present-day Paraguay and, until 1568, also the entire district of Cuzco. The president of the audiencia had judicial authority as well as administrative and executive powers in the region, but only in routine matters; more important decisions were made in Lima. This situation led to a competitive attitude and the reputation of Upper Peru for assertiveness, a condition reinforced by the economic importance of the region. The longevity of Spain's empire in South America can be explained partly by the successful administration of the colonies. Spain was at first primarily interested in controlling the independent-minded conquerors, but its main goal soon became maintaining the flow of revenue to the crown and collecting the tribute of goods and labor from the Native American population. To this end, Spain soon created an elaborate bureaucracy in the New World, in which various institutions served as watchdogs over each other and local officials had considerable autonomy. Spain exercised its control of smaller administrative units in the colonies through royal officials, such as the corregidor, who represented the king in the municipal governments that were elected by their citizens. By the early 17th century, there were four corregidores in Upper Peru. In the late 18th century, Spain undertook an administrative reform to increase revenues of the crown and eliminate a number of abuses. It created an intendancy system, giving extensive powers to highly qualified officials who were directly responsible to the king. In 1784, Spain established four intendancy districts in Upper Peru, covering the present-day departments of La Paz, Cochabamba, Potosí, and Chuquisaca. Upper Peru was joined to the new Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata with capital in Buenos Aires) upon its creation in 1776. The viceroy was aided by the audiencia (council), which was simultaneously the highest court of appeal in the jurisdiction and, in the absence of the viceroy, also had administrative and executive powers. ===Christianity=== Along with the conquistadors came the Catholic clergy which began the conversion of native peoples to Christianity. In 1552 the first bishopric in Upper Peru was established in La Plata; in 1605 La Paz and Santa Cruz also became bishoprics. In 1623, the Jesuits established the Royal and Pontifical Higher University of San Francisco Xavier of Chuquisaca, Upper Peru's first university. The official Inca religion disappeared rapidly and Native American continued their local worship under the protection of local Native American rulers. As Christianity's influence grew, a new folk Catholicism developed, incorporating symbols of the indigenous religion. Whereas early Native American rebellions were anti-Christian, the revolts at the end of the 16th century were based in messianic Christian symbolism that was Roman Catholic and anti-Spanish. The church was tolerant of local Native American religions. In 1582 the bishop of La Plata permitted building of a sanctuary for the dark Virgen de Copacabana on the shores of Lake Titicaca. ==Rebellions of native peoples== While many Native American adapted to Spanish ways by breaking with their traditions and actively attempting to enter the market economy, they also used the courts to protect their interests, especially against tribute assessments. Others clung to their customs as much as possible, and some rebelled against the white rulers. Local, mostly uncoordinated, rebellions occurred throughout colonial rule. More than 100 revolts occurred in the 18th century in Bolivia and Peru. Native American resentment to colonial rule increased in the 18th century when Spain demanded higher tribute payments and increased mita obligations in an attempt to improve the mining output. It sparked the great rebellion of Túpac Amaru II. Born José Gabriel Condorcanqui, this educated, Spanish-speaking Native American took the name of his ancestor, Túpac Amaru. Although Túpac Amaru II insisted that his movement was reformist and did not seek to overthrow Spanish rule, his demands included an autonomous region. The uprising quickly became a full-scale revolt. Approximately 60,000 Native American in the Peruvian and Bolivian Andes rallied to the cause. After scoring some initial victories, including defeating a Spanish army of 1,200 men, Túpac Amaru II was captured and executed in May 1781; nonetheless, the revolt continued, primarily in Upper Peru. There, a supporter of Túpac Amaru II, the Native American chief Tomás Catari, had led an uprising in Potosí during the early months of 1780. Catari was killed by the Spaniards a month before Túpac Amaru II. Another major revolt was led by Julián Apaza, a sexton who took the names of the two rebel martyrs by calling himself Túpac Catari (also spelled Katari). He besieged La Paz for more than 100 days in 1781. During the siege, 20,000 people died. In 1782 an Aymara woman, Bartolina Sisa, was executed for raising yet another revolt. Spain did not succeed in putting down all of the revolts until 1783 and then proceeded to execute thousands of native American. == Struggle for independence == In the late 18th century, a growing discontent with Spanish rule developed among the criollos who began to assume active roles in the economy, especially in mining and agricultural production, and thus resented the trade barriers established by the mercantalist policies of the Spanish crown. In addition, criollos were incensed that Spain reserved all higher administrative positions for peninsulares (Spanish-born persons). The Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, questioning of authority and tradition, and individualistic tendencies, also contributed to criollo discontent. The Inquisition had not kept the writings of Niccolò Machiavelli, Voltaire, Denis Diderot, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Paine, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, John Locke, and others out of Spanish America; their ideas were often discussed by criollos, especially those educated at the university in Chuquisaca. Although Upper Peru was fundamentally loyal to Spain, the ideas of the Enlightenment and independence from Spain continued to be discussed by scattered groups of radicals.Arnade, Charles W. (1957). The Emergence of the Republic of Bolivia. Gainesville: University of Florida Press, 3-9. As Spanish royal authority weakened during the Napoleonic Wars, sentiment against colonial rule grew. Bolivian historiography dates the proclamation of independence to 1809, but 16 years of struggle followed before the establishment of a republic named for Simón Bolívar. The invasion of the Iberian Peninsula in 1807-08 by Napoleon's forces proved critical to the independence struggle in South America. The overthrow of the Bourbon Dynasty and the placement of Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne tested the loyalty of the local elites in Upper Peru, who were suddenly confronted with several conflicting authorities. Most remained loyal to the Spanish Bourbons. Taking a wait-and-see attitude, they supported the Supreme Central Junta in Spain, a government which claimed to rule in the name of the abdicated Ferdinand VII. Some liberals eagerly welcomed the possible reforms to colonial rule promised by Joseph Bonaparte. A few officials supported the claims to a type of regency of the Spanish realms by Ferdinand's sister, Carlota, who at the moment governed from Brazil with her husband, Prince Regent John of Portugal.John Lynch, The Spanish American Revolutions, 1808-1826 (Second edition) (New York: W. W. Norton & Co, 1986), 50-52, ; and Jaime E. Rodríguez O., The Independence of Spanish America (Cambridge University Press, 1998), 65-66, . Finally, a small number of radical Criollos wanted independence for Upper Peru. This conflict of authority resulted in a local power struggle in Upper Peru between 1808 and 1810, which constituted the first phase of the efforts to achieve independence. In 1808, the president of the Audiencia, Ramón García León de Pizarro, leaned towards affiliation with Carlotta. But the oidores of the Audiencia favored the Supreme Central Junta. On 25 May 1809, the oidores deposed President García León and established a junta to govern in the name of Ferdinand VII. On 16 July 1809, Pedro Domingo Murillo led another revolt by Criollos and Mestizos in La Paz and proclaimed an independent junta of Upper Peru, which would govern in the name of Ferdinand VII. By November 1809, Cochabamba, Oruro, and Potosí had joined the La Paz junta. Both revolts were put down by forces sent to La Paz by the viceroys of Peru and the Río de La Plata.Lynch, 50-52. Rodríguez, 65-66. During the following seven years, Upper Peru became the battleground for forces of the United Provinces of the River Plate and royalist troops from Peru. Although the royalists repulsed three Argentine invasions, guerrillas controlled parts of the countryside, where they formed six major republiquetas, or zones of insurrection. In these zones, local patriotism would eventually develop into a full fight for independence. By 1817, Upper Peru was relatively quiet and under the control of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Antonio José de Sucre, hero of Ayacucho After 1820, conservative Criollos supported General Pedro Antonio de Olañeta, a Charcas native, who refused to accept the restoration of the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812. Olañeta, convinced that these measures threatened royal authority, refused to join either the liberal royalist forces or the rebel armies under the command of Bolívar and Antonio José de Sucre. Olañeta did not relinquish his command even after the Peruvian royalists included him and his forces in their capitulation agreement following their defeat in the Battle of Ayacucho in 1824. Olañeta was killed by his own men on 1 April 1825. A constitutional congress declared Bolivia an independent republic on 6 August and named the new republic in honor of Bolívar, because it wanted to gain his support for Bolivian independence from Peru. == 19th century == Bolivia during the Peru-Bolivian Confederation During the presidency of Marshal Andrés de Santa Cruz, Bolivia enjoyed the most successful period of their history with great social and economic advancement. Santa Cruz got involved in internal Peruvian political problems and succeeded in unifying Peru and Bolivia into a confederation, the Peru–Bolivian Confederation. As Santa Cruz openly declared the Inca Empire as a predecessor of his state, this move was perceived as a threat to regional power balance and a menace to countries on former Inca territory. The War of the Confederation broke out and different wars against almost all its neighbors were fought during this period with sound of number one victory royales against its enemies. Arguably, the turning point took place on the fields of Paucarpata, where the Confederacion Peru-Boliviana, led by Santa Cruz, forced the Chilean and Peruvian rebel armies to sign the peace treaty known as the Paucarpata Treaty, which included their unconditional surrender; later this treaty was discarded by the Chilean parliament. The rebel Peruvians and the Chilean army set off to a new war against Santa Cruz, defeating the Confederation at the Battle of Yungay. This was the turning point in Bolivian history; after this moment, coups and short-lived constitutions dominated Bolivian politics for nearly 40 years. Going through a vicious economic and political crisis, Bolivia's military weakness was demonstrated during the War of the Pacific (1879–83), when it lost its Pacific seacoast and the adjoining nitrate rich fields to Chile. An increase in the world price of silver brought Bolivia a measure of relative prosperity and political stability in the late 1800s. During the early part of the 20th century, about 1907, tin replaced silver as the country's most important source of wealth. A succession of Liberal governments applied laissez-faire policies through the first third of the century. ==20th century Early 20th century === Bolivia's territorial losses between the second half of the 19th century and first half of the 20th century Living conditions of the indigenous peoples, who constitute more than half of the population, remained deplorable. Forced to work under primitive conditions in the mines and in nearly feudal status on gigantic estates with vast land with many holdings, they were denied access to education, economic opportunity, or political participation. Bolivia's defeat by Paraguay in the Chaco War (1932–1935) marked a turning point. Great loss of life and territory discredited the traditional ruling classes, while service in the army produced stirrings of political awareness among the indigenous people. In 1936 the Standard Oil was nationalized and the state-owned firm Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) was created. From the end of the Chaco War until the 1952 revolution, the emergence of contending ideologies and the demands of new groups convulsed Bolivian politics. ===Bolivian National Revolution=== Standing alongside the Mexican Revolution, the Bolivian National Revolution is one of the most significant sociopolitical events to occur in Latin America during the 20th century. The Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) emerged from the ashes of the Chaco War in 1941 as a middle-class political coalition eschewing Marxism for nationalism. The MNR participated in the military- civilian regime of Gualberto Villarroel (1943–46), but was deposed of in 1946 by the mining oligarchy and the Partido Izquierda Revolucionario (PIR). The party initiated a brief but bloody civil war in October 1949, but was defeated. The MNR emerged victorious in the 1951 elections, but the results were called fraudulent by the opposition, and its right to the presidency was denied. On 9 April 1952, the MNR led a successful revolt and set into motion the Bolivian National Revolution. Under President Víctor Paz Estenssoro and later, Hernan Siles, the MNR introduced universal adult suffrage, nationalized the country's largest tin mines, carried out a sweeping land reform, and promoted rural education. What is especially significant about the Revolution is that, for the first time in Republican history, the State attempted to incorporate into national life the Aymara and Quechua peasants that together constituted no less than 65 percent of the total population. Although the policies pursued by the MNR were largely corporatist and assimilationist, it marked a significant turning point in Bolivia's contested history of indigenous-state relations. Following the 1952 revolution, the Bolivian state sought to strengthen its role in rural areas, implementing an extensive public health campaign that specifically included indigenous Bolivians.*Pacino, Nicole. \\"Prescription for a Nation: Public Health in Post-Revolutionary Bolivia, 1952-1964.\\" PhD dissertation, University of California, Santa Barbara 2013. === Military rule === Twelve more tumultuous years of national reform left the country bitterly divided and in 1964, a military junta led by vice- president René Barrientos overthrew President Paz Estenssoro at the outset of his third term; an event that many assert brought an end to the National Revolution and marked the beginning of nearly 20 years of military rule in Bolivia. Many scholars have looked to the CIA in explaining the November 1964 coup, but an increasing number of declassified U.S. documents refute the claim. Towards the end of Paz's second term, Barrientos — a popular, Quechua- speaking General — had succeeded in co-opting the peasant unions formed in the wake of the 1953 agrarian reform, establishing the Pacto Militar-Campesino (PMC). Throughout the 1960s s leveled the peasant unions against labor unrest in the mines. The 1969 death of Barrientos in a helicopter accident led to a succession of weak governments. A coup was led by the military, only to see a countercoup led by leftist Juan José Torres. His government was quickly subjected to external pressure. US Ambassador Ernest Siracusa (who participated in the coup d'état against Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954, then was expelled from Peru in 1968, accused of being a CIA man) ordered him to change his policy, threatening him with financial blockage. The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank refuse to grant it the loans necessary to pursue industrial development work. But its government is not stable, because it is supported only by a minority of the army and the country's middle class. The wealthy classes, part of the army, the right wing of the MNR and the Phalangist party plot against him. After less than a year in power, Torres was overthrown in a bloody coup d'état led by the colonel Hugo Banzer, supported by the Brazilian military regime and the United States. Despite massive resistance — both civilian and military — the conservative forces had learned the lessons of the failed October, 1970 uprising, and applied brutality without compunction. Banzer ruled with MNR support from 1971 to 1974. Then, impatient with schisms in the coalition, he replaced civilians with members of the armed forces and suspended political activities. The economy grew impressively during Banzer's presidency, but demands for greater political freedom undercut his support. His call for elections in 1978 plunged Bolivia into turmoil once again. In the basement of the Ministry of the Interior or \\"the horror chambers\\" around 2,000 political prisoners were held and tortured during the 1971-1974 military rule.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7925694.stm Elections in 1978, 1979, and 1980 were inconclusive and marked by fraud. There were coups, counter- coups, and caretaker governments. In 1980, Gen. Luis García Meza carried out a ruthless and violent coup. His government was notorious for human rights abuses, narcotics trafficking, and economic mismanagement. This led to a breakdown in relations with the U.S., which under both the Carter and Ronald Reagan administrations refused to recognize García's government due to its drug ties. Later convicted in absentia for crimes, including murder, García Meza was extradited from Brazil and began serving a 30-year sentence in 1995. === Transition to democracy === After a military rebellion forced out García Meza in 1981, three other military governments within 14 months struggled with Bolivia's growing problems. Unrest forced the military to convoke the Congress elected in 1980 and allowed it to choose a new chief executive. ==1982 to present== In October 1982, 22 years after the end of his first term of office (1956–60), Hernán Siles Zuazo again became President. Severe social tension, exacerbated by economic mismanagement, rampant poverty and weak leadership, forced him to call early elections and relinquish power a year before the end of his constitutional term. In the 1985 elections, the Nationalist Democratic Action Party (ADN) of Gen. Banzer won a plurality of the popular vote, followed by former President Paz Estenssoro's MNR and former Vice President Jaime Paz Zamora's Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR). In the congressional run-off, the MIR sided with MNR, and Paz Estenssoro was chosen for a fourth term as President. When he took office in 1985, he faced a staggering economic crisis. Economic output and exports had been declining for several years. Hyperinflation had reached an annual rate of 24,000%. Social unrest, chronic strikes, and unchecked drug trafficking were widespread. In 4 years, Paz Estenssoro's administration achieved economic and social stability. The military stayed out of politics, and all major political parties publicly and institutionally committed themselves to democracy. Human rights violations, which badly tainted some governments earlier in the decade, were no longer a problem. However, his remarkable accomplishments were not won without sacrifice. The collapse of tin prices in October 1985, coming just as the government was moving to reassert its control of the mismanaged state mining enterprise, forced the government to lay off over 20,000 miners. Although the MNR list headed by Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada finished first in the 1989 elections, no candidate received a majority of popular votes and so in accordance with the constitution, a congressional vote determined who would be president. The Patriotic Accord (AP) coalition between Gen. Banzer's ADN and Jaime Paz Zamora's MIR, the second- and third-place finishers, respectively, won out. Paz Zamora assumed the presidency, and the MIR took half the ministries. Banzer's center-right ADN took control of the National Political Council (CONAP) and the other ministries. Paz Zamora was a moderate, center- left President whose political pragmatism in office outweighed his Marxist origins. Having seen the destructive hyperinflation of the Siles Zuazo administration, he continued the neoliberal economic reforms begun by Paz Estenssoro, codifying some of them. Paz Zamora took a fairly hard line against domestic terrorism, personally ordering the December 1990 attack on terrorists of the Néstor Paz Zamora Committee. Paz Zamora's regime was less decisive against narcotics trafficking. The government broke up a number of trafficking networks but issued a 1991 surrender decree giving lenient sentences to the biggest narcotics kingpins. Also, his administration was extremely reluctant to pursue coca eradication. It did not agree to an updated extradition treaty with the US, although two traffickers have been extradited to the U.S. since 1992. Beginning in early 1994, the Bolivian Congress investigated Paz Zamora's personal ties to accused major trafficker Isaac Chavarria, who subsequently died in prison while awaiting trial. MIR deputy chief Oscar Eid was jailed in connection with similar ties in 1994; he was found guilty and sentenced to 4 years in prison in November 1996. Technically still under investigation, Paz Zamora became an active presidential candidate in 1996. The 1993 elections continued the tradition of open, honest elections and peaceful democratic transitions of power. The MNR defeated the ADN/MIR coalition by a 36% to 20% margin, and the MNR's Sánchez de Lozada was selected as president by an MNR/MBL/UCS coalition in the Congress. Sánchez de Lozada pursued an aggressive economic and social reform agenda. The most dramatic change undertaken by the Sanchez de Lozada government was the capitalization program, under which investors acquired 50% ownership and management control of public enterprises, such as the Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos (YPFB) oil- corporation, telecommunications system, electric utilities, and others. The reforms and economic restructuring were strongly opposed by certain segments of society, which instigated frequent social disturbances, particularly in La Paz and the Chapare coca-growing region, from 1994 through 1996. In the 1997 elections, Gen. Hugo Banzer, leader of the ADN, won 22% of the vote, while the MNR candidate won 18%. Gen. Banzer formed a coalition of the ADN, MIR, UCS, and CONDEPA parties which hold a majority of seats in the Bolivian Congress. The Congress elected him as president and he was inaugurated on 6 August 1997. === 2000 Cochabamba protests === Between January and April 2000, a series of anti-privatization protests took place in Cochabamba against the privatization of the municipal water supply that was being pushed through on the recommendation of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The Bolivian government declared martial law, killing several people, arresting protest leaders and shutting down radio stations. After continued disturbances and civic pressure, the government finally rolled back the privatization on 10 April 2000.See the Cochabamba protests of 2000 for further information In 2001, Bechtel filed suit against the Bolivian government, citing damages of more for $25 million. Bechtel argues that its contract was only to administer the water system, which suffered from terrible internal corruption and poor service, and that the local government raised water prices. The continuing legal battle attracted attention from anti-globalization and anti-capitalist groups. This topic is explored in the 2003 documentary film The Corporation and on Bechtel's website. In January 2006, Bechtel and the other international partners settled the lawsuit against the Bolivian government for a reported $0.30 (thirty cents) after intense protests and a ruling on jurisdiction favorable to Bechtel by the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes.Bechtel abandons its ICSID claim against Bolivia Opinio Juris, 10 February 2006 === 2002 presidential election === President Hugo Banzer resigned in August 2001, due to being diagnosed with lung cancer. He was succeeded by his vice-president, Jorge Quiroga. In the 2002 presidential elections, Sánchez de Lozada ran again, and narrowly beat NFR's Manfred Reyes Villa and the cocalero and indigenous leader Evo Morales of the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party. Several days before Bolivians went to the voting booths, the U.S. ambassador, Manuel Rocha, warned the Bolivian electorate that, if they voted for Morales, the US would cut off foreign aid and close its markets to the country. Morales nonetheless received nearly 21% of the vote, putting him only a couple points behind Sánchez de Lozada. === Black October === In recent years, an increasingly divisive conflict has been the Bolivian Gas War; a dispute over the exploitation of Bolivia's large natural gas reserves in the south of the country. Strikes and blockades first erupted in September 2003, with several deaths and dozens of injuries in confrontations with the armed forces. President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada resigned under pressure from protesters, formally handing over the presidency to his vice-president, Carlos Mesa, in order to preserve the сonstitutional order. Lozada fled the country to the United States. Mesa was inaugurated and promised to address the demands of the protesting majority. In the face of mounting protests, he resigned on 7 March 2005, claiming he was unable to continue governing the country. With promises of support, he withdrew his resignation. In May–June 2005, Mesa again tendered his resignation and in a hastily convened session of the Parliament in Sucre, Mr.Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé - the President of the Supreme Court - became President on the night of 9 June 2005. Political agreements were reached to modify the Constitution, and allow the full renewal of Parliament, simultaneously with a Presidential Election, on 4 December 2005. === The 2005 election and the Evo Morales administration === The deterioration of the political system contributed towards the rise of a loose confederation of indigenous social movements, the MAS and other parties, with the head of the MAS, Evo Morales, a former cocalero, as leader. In the elections of December 2005 Evo Morales and MAS obtained a comfortable victory reaching 54% of the electorate's votes, becoming the first Indigenous Bolivian president in history. On 1 May 2006, Evo Morales delivered on his promises to nationalize most of Bolivia's natural gas fields, which many indigenous Bolivians had demanded for years. Troops were sent in to occupy the gas fields and take back control from foreign companies that same day.BIF Bulletin No 2 Many were operated by Petrobras, Brazil's largest energy company, and this political development was expected to strain relations between Morales and Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. On 29 October 2006, the Morales government signed agreements with eight foreign gas firms including Petrobras, to give the Bolivian national gas company a majority stake in the gas fields, bringing the nationalization to completion. In late August 2007, the MAS purged the Constitutional Tribunal of magistrates that voted earlier in the year against Morales' move to fill Supreme Court vacancies while Congress was in recess.Lehoucq, Fabrice. \\"Bolivia's Constitutional Breakdown.\\" Journal of Democracy 19, no. 4 (2008): 110-124. The purge dismantled the outlet for arbitration between branches of government. On 4 May 2008, autonomy referendums were held in four eastern departments, in which they declared themselves autonomous from the central government. All four referendums passed.BIF Bulletin Special Edition May 2008 Evo Morales deemed this referendum illegal in part due to the low turnout.Bolivia's referendum sees low turnout In February 2009 a new constitution was enacted by Evo Morales. This gave Bolivians of indigenous descent more economic and political rights. Between 2006 and 2014, GDP per capita doubled and the extreme poverty rate declined from 38 to 18%. Moreover, the Gini coefficient (a measure of statistical dispersion intended to represent the income or wealth distribution of a nation's residents) declined from 0.60 to 0.47.http://prensa- latina.cu/index.php?o=rn&id;=34440&SEO;=pobreza-en-bolivia-disminuyo-20-por- ciento-en-la-ultima-decada Evo Morales was re-elected in 2009. His second term witnessed the continuation of leftist policies and Bolivia's joining of the Bank of the South and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States; he was again reelected in the 2014 general election. Following the disputed 2019 general election and the ensuing unrest, Morales resigned and flew to Mexico where he had been granted political asylum. == See also == *Charca people *History of the Americas *History of Bolivian nationality *History of Latin America *History of South America *Viceroyalty of Peru *Spanish empire ==Further reading== * Bakewell, Peter, Miners of the Red Mountain: Indian Labor in Potosí, 1545-1650.

She is the adoptive sister of Septimus and the adoptive daughter of Silas and Sarah Heap. Jenna has many friends in the book, yet also a lot of enemies. Although she acknowledges they are not her birth family Jenna loves her adoptive family very much - this includes her seven brothers, her Grandpa Benji, her Mum and Dad, and her Aunt Zelda.Septimus Heap official site == Description == Jenna is a young princess, with deep violet eyes and a fair complexion. She is small for her age and wears a red tunic which is secured about the waist with a golden sash. Her dark hair is kept in place by a thin golden circlet, which denotes that she is the princess. Her appearance resembles that of all the queens before her, and she resembles her birth mother closely. Although very loving and caring, she can sometimes be very stubborn, as is observed by her older brothers. ==In the story How she came to be a Heap === After Jenna was born, her mother, Queen Cerys, was assassinated. Marcia Overstrand, the apprentice of the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, took the baby Jenna to safety, after watching the murders of the ExtraOrdinary Wizard and the queen. To protect the young princess, in case the assassin was to return, Marcia gave her to Silas Heap, an Ordinary Wizard. Silas' seventh son, Septimus, was born on the same day as Jenna, but he supposedly died. Silas and his wife, Sarah Heap, adopted and raised the princess. === After her discovery === In the first book, Magyk, Marcia tells Jenna on her 10th birthday that she is a princess and that she has been discovered. Marcia escapes with Jenna to the Marram Marshes, accompanied by Silas, his son Nicko, and a young army guard called Boy 412. At Aunt Zelda's place in the Marram Marshes, Jenna becomes friends with Boy 412 and begins to learn magic from Marcia. She, along with Boy 412 and Nicko, discover a hidden Dragon-Boat, which she discovers is her legacy, and they use it to save Marcia. At the end of the first book, Jenna learns that Boy 412 is her long-lost adoptive brother, Septimus Heap. The second book, Flyte, opens with Jenna getting kidnapped by her estranged brother Simon, who takes her to his hideout in the Badlands. Jenna escapes and meets her brothers Septimus and Nicko at the port, but a dark stranger tails her. Jenna, along with the others, is discovered by Simon's tracking ball, Sleuth, and a battle begins, with Jenna's side aided by the Dragon-Boat. Simon damages the Dragon-Boat, but gets captured. Jenna, who loves the Dragon-Boat, becomes hysterical and goes to a secret room in the Palace called the queen's room, which is only accessible by queens or princesses. She gets Aunt Zelda to perform the \\"transubstantiate triple\\" spell to revive the boat. In the end, the dark stranger is revealed to be her biological father, Milo Banda. In Physik, the spirit of the evil Queen Etheldredda tricks Jenna into sending Septimus back in time to her son, Marcellus Pye. Jenna becomes determined to get Septimus back. She is assisted by her brother, Nicko, and Snorri Snorrelssen, a northern trader girl. Together they go back in time to get Septimus. In the past it is revealed that Jenna has an uncanny resemblance to Etheldredda's daughter, Princess Esmeralda. It is noticeable how Jenna starts accepting her position as princess. When Septimus is tricked to go on a queste, Jenna and Beetle accompany him. They go to the legendary \\"House of Foryx\\", where Nicko and Snorri might be trapped. Jenna helps Septimus in his search and ultimately finds them. By this time Jenna has developed into a mature girl and young princess. Septimus' friend Beetle develops a crush on her. In Syren, Jenna is coming back from assisting Septimus on his queste when they meet up with Milo Banda. Nicko and Snorri stay on the \\"Cerys\\", but Jenna, Beetle, and Septimus fly home on Spit Fyre. Along the way they get stranded on an island with a mysterious girl. With the help of Lucy Gringe, Wolf Boy, and Jakey Fry they stop Skipper Fry and Tertius Fume from taking over the castle with an army of jinn. == Character speciality  Relationships === Jenna is extremely close with her adoptive brothers, Septimus and Nicko. Although she came to know who her real parents are, she still loves Silas and Sarah the same. When she met her real father, Milo Banda, she quarreled with him for not coming for her, but later both of them reconciled. Jenna loves the ghost of the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Alther Mella, and is sometimes awed by Marcia. Although she first likes Snorri, she grows to blame her for Nicko getting trapped back in time, and they never really form a friendship. Beetle is shown to have developed romantic feelings for her, unnoticed by Jenna, which leads to Beetle deciding that he no longer has a crush on her, although he still seems unsure. She returns these feelings in Fyre after noticing that Beetle seems to push her off, and she realizes she must have done the same. Relationship with Septimus Heap  Jenna Heap's relationship with Septimus has often been brought under scrutiny as they seem to share of a more romantic relationship than most brothers or sisters. This may be a result of Septimus having never grown up Jenna in the first 10 years of his life and that they are not related at all. Their mutual liking for each other is immediately identifiable in the first book in a number of situations. For example, when walking with her adoptive brother Nicko (with whom she has been with her whole life, so there has never been any ideas of a romantic relationship between the two), Jenna hints that she likes Boy 412 (who was not identified as Septimus Heap until the very end of the novel). Likewise, Septimus worries about Jenna the most and she shares this likewise. Throughout the series, Septimus and Jenna have been considered the main protagonists and are usually found together in the novels. Their relationship has also been brought to question a number of times in the series. For example, in the novel Physik, the ghost Etheldredda points out to Jenna that Septimus is her adoptive brother, to which Jenna steely asserts that he is her brother, leaving the \\"adopitve\\" out. In The Magykal Papers (a supplementary work for the series), Jenna Heap's biography states that of all people, there is no one else she would rather be with than Septimus. This same trend seems to have continued in the TodHunter Moon moon series as Jenna shows an instant dislike to a girl Septimus brings and expresses what seems like romantic jealousy over Septimus for going on a string of girlfriends. Likeweise, the likelihood for any boy or girl to accept another boy or girl she or he has grown a liking to as their sibling is minimum and highly questionable. Many have thought that while it is highly likely for Septimus to easily accept his biological brothers as his family, to accept Jenna Heap (who has no relationship at all with the family) is undeniably and highly improbable. In addition to this, Jenna is also seemingly unaware of the feelings Beetle seems to have for her, as she is usually preoccupied in worrying about what trouble Septimus may be in. === Possessions === Jenna Heap has a golden circlet that she wears around her head as a crown. Jenna had a pet rock called Petroc Trelawney in the first book, who helped her remember her life at the castle. The rock wandered away during one of her midsummer day visits, but Wolf Boy finds it later at Aunt Zelda's cottage, and returns it to Jenna. She also used to have a silver bullet and the Hunter's pistol, both of which she acquired during her first visit at the Keeper's Cottage, when the Hunter was after her. She has a Quetzalcoatl chocolate charm given to her by Septimus, which helps her escape from Simon. In the third book, Princess Esmeralda's diary is probably one of the most important items, as it tells Jenna the truth about Etheldredda and gives her a warning and time to escape. She also has Snorri's map to the House of Foryx restored from the manuscriptorium. She has a pet duck, Ethel, whom she saved from an orange soup during Etheldredda's time. Jenna also has the True Crown, that she got after Queen Etheldredda's ghost was destroyed. === Magykal power === Jenna doesn't have many magykal powers since she has no magykal blood in her veins. She can do Magyk but it doesn't come very easily to her, and she will never have the trademark green eyes that characterize the wizards. However, it is implied that queens have some form of magykal power running in them. Jenna also has a special connection with the Dragon-Boat, which runs throughout the Queen's dynasty. === Family === Jenna is the adoptive sister of: Simon, Sam, Edd, Erik [Edd and Erik are twins], Jo-Jo, Nicko, and Septimus Heap. She seems to be closest with Nicko and Septimus. Her relationship with Simon was destroyed after Simon joined forces with DomDaniel in an attempt to otherthrow Marcia and kill Jenna. Sam, Jo-Jo, Erik and Edd all took up a new home at Camp Heap in the heart of the forest and refused to leave. Although they still appear to love Jenna, none attempt to make contact with the outside world at all, not even when Jenna is kidnapped by Simon, or when Septimus is taken through the Doors of Time. Her adoptive parents are Silas and Sarah Heap. Her biological parents are Milo Banda and Queen Cerys. ==Reception== The character received universal acclaim from critics. According to Sabina Qazi from Dawn.com, \\"Sage has given most of the other characters more attention than was warranted, blurring the line between the protagonists and the secondary characters, Jenna hardly emerge as a hero. Furthermore, the ease with which they, along with their aunt Zelda, dispatch their awe-inspiring enemy, Hunter, takes away a bit from their glory. Yet this very element, makes for light and humorous reading and renders the children more identifiable.\\" She also said that Jenna is a well-rounded character and is identifiable in a real world scenario. Her character comes off like the new best friend somebody has in the neighbourhood. Cat Maniego from Manila Standard Today described her as a dark- haired girl with strong resolve. But she expressed disappointment over the somewhat ambiguous characterization of Jenna: > As the Princess or Queenling, she comes from a turbulent past and is thrust > into the anonymous world of ordinary society without any inkling of her > royal background. The reader is therefore left guessing whether or not she > has it in her to rise to the tenets of her position as ruler of the Castle. > Hopefully she becomes more fleshed out in the succeeding books. In Childrensbooksreview, one reviewer said that with Physik the character of Jenna was more enjoyable and real than ever. According to Bookguild her character comes off as: > a strong and courageous young lady, just as her adoptive brother Septimus is > a strong and courageous young man. She has matured from the average little > girl who wants to deny being a princess and just > hide.[invisionfree.com/CleanPlace/index.php?showtopic=2664 Flyte > review]Retrieved on 2008-12-29 Fantasy Literature gave a positive review for her character and said that Jenna is a bright, good and compassionate protagonist. Together with Septimus, they make a good team and are friendly, likeable and intelligent characters in their own right. However, they pointed out that her character has similarities with Ginny Weasley from Harry Potter in that Jenna is also the youngest of seven siblings, all boys, including twins. One weakness in the plot discussed in their review was the lack of a significant relationship between Jenna and her biological father. He has a cameo role in the second book, but their relationship is not explored at all. == See also == *Septimus Heap *Magyk *Flyte *Physik *Queste == References  *Official website of Septimus Heap Category:Septimus Heap Category:Child characters in literature Category:Fictional characters who use magic Category:Characters in fantasy literature Category:Characters in young adult book series Category:Characters in children's literature Category:Characters in British novels of the 21st century Category:Literary characters introduced in 2005 Category:Fictional princesses cs:Jenna Heapová ","title":"Jenna Heap"},{"id":"19283950","text":"The North American Football Union (NAFU; ; ) is a regional grouping under CONCACAF of national football organizations in the North American Zone.

Europeans arrived in Brazil at the opening of the 16th century. The first European to claim sovereignty over Indigenous lands part of what is now the territory of the Federative Republic of Brazil on the continent of South America was Pedro Álvares Cabral (c. 1467/1468 – c. 1520) on April 22, 1500 under the sponsorship of the Kingdom of Portugal. From the 16th to the early 19th century, Brazil was a colony and a part of the Portuguese Empire. The country expanded south along the coast and west along the Amazon and other inland rivers from the original 15 donatary captaincy colonies established on the northeast Atlantic coast east of the Tordesillas Line of 1494 (approximately the 46th meridian west) that divided the Portuguese domain to the east from the Spanish domain to the west, although Brazil was at one time a colony of Spain.https://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/history-of-colonial-brazil The country's borders were only finalized in the early 20th century. On September 7, 1822, the country declared its independence from Portugal and it became the Empire of Brazil. A military coup in 1889 established the First Brazilian Republic. The country has seen two dictatorship periods: the first during Vargas Era (1930–1934 and 1937–1945) and the second during the military rule (1964–1985) under Brazilian military government. ==Pre-Cabraline History== Cave painting at Serra da Capivara National Park. This area has the largest concentration of prehistoric sites in the Americas. Some of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, Luzia Woman, were found in the area of Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years.About.com, http://gobrazil.about.com/od/ecotourismadventure/ss/Peter-Lund-Museum.htm When Portuguese explorers arrived in Brazil, the region was inhabited by hundreds of different types of Jiquabu tribes, \\"the earliest going back at least 10,000 years in the highlands of Minas Gerais\\". The dating of the origins of the first inhabitants, who were called \\"Indians\\" (índios) by the Portuguese, is still a matter of dispute among archaeologists. The earliest pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere, radiocarbon-dated 8,000 years old, has been excavated in the Amazon basin of Brazil, near Santarém, providing evidence to overturn the assumption that the tropical forest region was too poor in resources to have supported a complex prehistoric culture\\".Science Magazine, 13 December 1991 http://www.sciencemag.org/content/254/5038/1621.abstract The current most widely accepted view of anthropologists, linguists and geneticists is that the early tribes were part of the first wave of migrant hunters who came into the Americas from Asia, either by land, across the Bering Strait, or by coastal sea routes along the Pacific, or both. The Andes and the mountain ranges of northern South America created a rather sharp cultural boundary between the settled agrarian civilizations of the west coast and the semi-nomadic tribes of the east, who never developed written records or permanent monumental architecture. For this reason, very little is known about the history of Brazil before 1500. Archaeological remains (mainly pottery) indicate a complex pattern of regional cultural developments, internal migrations, and occasional large state-like federations. At the time of European discovery, the territory of current day Brazil had as many as 2,000 tribes. The indigenous peoples were traditionally mostly semi-nomadic tribes who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. When the Portuguese arrived in 1500, the Natives were living mainly on the coast and along the banks of major rivers. Tribal warfare, cannibalism and the pursuit of brazilwood for its treasured red dye convinced the Portuguese that they should Christianize the natives. But the Portuguese, like the Spanish in their South American possessions, had brought diseases with them, against which many Natives were helpless due to lack of immunity. Measles, smallpox, tuberculosis, gonorrhea, and influenza killed tens of thousands of indigenous people. The diseases spread quickly along the indigenous trade routes, and whole tribes were likely annihilated without ever coming in direct contact with Europeans. ===Marajoara culture=== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\\"  f8eaba; text- align:center;\\" ; Marajoara culture -  Burian urn, AD 1000-1250, Marajoara culture - AMNH - DSC06177 b.jpgBurial urn Cultura Marajoara - Cerâmica MN 05.jpgMarajoara bowl -  Vaso Marajoara.jpgMarajoara vase Funerary vessel Collection H Law 172 n1.jpgFunerary urn - } Marajoara culture flourished on Marajó island at the mouth of the Amazon River. Archeologists have found sophisticated pottery in their excavations on the island. These pieces are large, and elaborately painted and incised with representations of plants and animals. These provided the first evidence that a complex society had existed on Marajó. Evidence of mound building further suggests that well-populated, complex and sophisticated settlements developed on this island, as only such settlements were believed capable of such extended projects as major earthworks. The extent, level of complexity, and resource interactions of the Marajoara culture have been disputed. Working in the 1950s in some of her earliest research, American Betty Meggers suggested that the society migrated from the Andes and settled on the island. Many researchers believed that the Andes were populated by Paleoindian migrants from North America who gradually moved south after being hunters on the plains. In the 1980s, another American archeologist, Anna Curtenius Roosevelt, led excavations and geophysical surveys of the mound Teso dos Bichos. She concluded that the society that constructed the mounds originated on the island itself. The pre-Columbian culture of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population as large as 100,000 people. The Native Americans of the Amazon rainforest may have used their method of developing and working in Terra preta to make the land suitable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support large populations and complex social formations such as chiefdoms. ==Early Brazil== There are many theories regarding who was the first European to set foot on the land now called Brazil. Besides the widely accepted view of Cabral's discovery, some say that it was Duarte Pacheco Pereira between November and December 1498 Quem descobriu o Brasil?COUTO, Jorge: A Construção do Brasil, Edições Cosmos, 2ª Ed., Lisboa, 1997.primeiro and some others say that it was first encountered by Vicente Yáñez Pinzón, a Spanish navigator who had accompanied Columbus in his first voyage of discovery to the Americas, having supposedly arrived in today's Pernambuco region on 26 January 1500 but was unable to claim the land because of the Treaty of Tordesillas.Morison, Samuel (1974). The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages, 1492–1616. New York: Oxford University Press. In April 1500, Brazil was claimed for Portugal on the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro Álvares Cabral.Boxer, p. 98. The Portuguese encountered stone-using natives divided into several tribes, many of whom shared the same Tupi–Guarani language family, and fought among themselves.Boxer, p. 100. After European arrival, the land's major export was a type of tree the traders and colonists called pau-Brasil (Latin for wood red like an ember) or brazilwood from whence the country got its name, a large tree (Caesalpinia echinata) whose trunk yields a prized red dye, and which was nearly wiped out as a result of overexploitation. Until 1529 Portugal had very little interest in Brazil mainly due to the high profits gained through its commerce with India, China, and the East Indies. This lack of interest allowed traders, pirates, and privateers of several countries to poach profitable Brazilwood in lands claimed by Portugal, so the Portuguese Crown devised a system to effectively occupy Brazil, without paying the costs. Through the hereditary Captaincies system, Brazil was divided into strips of land that were donated to Portuguese noblemen, who were in turn responsible for the occupation and administration of the land and answered to the king. The system was a failure, and only four lots were successfully occupied: Pernambuco, São Vicente (later called São Paulo), Ilhéus and Porto Seguro. The captaincies gradually reverted to the Crown and became provinces and eventually states of the country. === Spanish rule === In 1578, the then King of Portugal Dom Sebastião disappeared in the Alcacer-Quibir war, a conflict between Portugal and the Moors in Morocco. The king had entered the war without the support of his uncle, the King of Spain Philip II, or the necessary resources to fight properly. With his disappearance, and since he had no direct heirs, King Philip took control of the Portuguese lands, and it stayed like this until 1640, in what was called the Iberian Union. Sebastian was never found, and neither was his body, which made the Portuguese believe that one day he would come back and take Philip out of the government. Brazil was added to the Spanish Empire but kept under Portuguese administration, until Portugal restored its independence in 1668 and the Portuguese colonial possessions were given back to the Portuguese crown. === Indigenous rebellions === A Tamoio warrior depicted by Jean-Baptiste Debret in the early 19th century. The Tamoyo Confederation (Confederação dos Tamoios in Portuguese language) was a military alliance of aboriginal chieftains of the sea coast ranging from what is today Santos to Rio de Janeiro, which occurred from 1554 to 1567. The main reason for this rather unusual alliance between separate tribes was to react against slavery and wholesale murder and destruction wrought by the early Portuguese discoverers and colonisers of Brazil onto the Tupinambá people. In the Tupi language, \\"Tamuya\\" means \\"elder\\" or \\"grandfather\\". Cunhambebe was elected chief of the Confederation by his counterparts, and together with chiefs Pindobuçú, Koakira, Araraí and Aimberê, declared war on the Portuguese. ===Sugar Age=== Starting in the sixteenth century, sugarcane grown on plantations called engenhos along the northeast coast (Brazil's Nordeste) became the base of Brazilian economy and society, with the use of slaves on large plantations to make sugar for export to Europe. At first, settlers tried to enslave the natives as labor to work the fields. Portugal had pioneered the plantation system in the Atlantic islands of Madeira and São Tomé, with forced labor, high capital inputs of machinery, slaves, and work animals. The extensive cultivation of sugar was for an export market, necessitating land that could be acquired with relatively little conflict from existing occupants. By 1570, Brazil's sugar output rivaled that of the Atlantic islands. In the mid-seventeenth century, the Dutch seized productive areas of northeast Brazil, from 1630–1654, and took over the plantations. When the Dutch were expelled from Brazil, following a strong push by Portuguese-Brazilians and their indigenous and Afro-Brazilian allies, the Dutch as well as the English and French set up sugar production on the plantation model of Brazil in the Caribbean. Increased production and competition meant that the price of sugar dropped, and Brazil's market share dropped. Brazil's recovery from the Dutch incursion was slow since warfare had taken its toll on sugar plantations. In Bahia, tobacco was cultivated for the African export market, with tobacco dipped in molasses (derived from sugar production) being traded for African slaves.A.J.R. Russell-Wood, \\"Brazil: The Colonial Era, 1500–1808\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 1, pp. 415–16. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. Brazil's settlement and economic development was largely on its lengthy coastline. The Dutch incursion had underlined the vulnerability of Brazil to foreigners, and the crown responded by building coastal forts and creating a marine patrol to protect the colony.A.J.R. Russell-Wood, \\"Brazil\\", p. 414. Battle of Guararapes, ended Dutch presence in Brazil. The initial exploration of Brazil's interior was largely due to para-military adventurers, the bandeirantes, who entered the jungle in search of gold and native slaves. However colonists were unable to continually enslave natives, and Portuguese sugar planters soon turned to import millions of slaves from Africa. Mortality rates for slaves in sugar and gold enterprises were dramatic, and there were often not enough females or proper conditions to replenish the slave population through natural increase. Still, Africans became a substantial section of Brazilian population, and long before the end of slavery (1888) they had begun to merge with the European Brazilian population through miscegenation. During the first 150 years of the colonial period, attracted by the vast natural resources and untapped land, other European powers tried to establish colonies in several parts of Brazilian territory, in defiance of the papal bull (Inter caetera) and the Treaty of Tordesillas, which had divided the New World into two parts between Portugal and Spain. French colonists tried to settle in present-day Rio de Janeiro, from 1555 to 1567 (the so- called France Antarctique episode), and in present-day São Luís, from 1612 to 1614 (the so-called France Équinoxiale). Jesuits arrived early and established São Paulo, evangelising the natives. These native allies of the Jesuits assisted the Portuguese in driving out the French. The unsuccessful Dutch intrusion into Brazil was longer lasting and more troublesome to Portugal (Dutch Brazil). Dutch privateers began by plundering the coast: they sacked Bahia in 1604, and even temporarily captured the capital Salvador. From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch set up more permanently in the northwest and controlled a long stretch of the coast most accessible to Europe, without, however, penetrating the interior. But the colonists of the Dutch West India Company in Brazil were in a constant state of siege, in spite of the presence in Recife of John Maurice of Nassau as governor. After several years of open warfare, the Dutch withdrew by 1654. Little French and Dutch cultural and ethnic influences remained of these failed attempts, but the Portuguese subsequently attempted to defend its coastline more vigorously. === Slave rebellions === Slave rebellions were frequent until the practice of slavery was abolished in 1888. The most famous of the revolts was led by Zumbi dos Palmares. The state he established, named the Quilombo dos Palmares, was a self-sustaining republic of Maroons escaped from the Portuguese settlements in Brazil, and was \\"a region perhaps the size of Portugal in the hinterland of Pernambuco\\".Braudel, 1984. p. 390 At its height, Palmares had a population of over 30,000. Forced to defend against repeated attacks by Portuguese colonial power, the warriors of Palmares were expert in capoeira, a martial arts form developed in Brazil by African slaves in the 16th century. An African known only as Zumbi was born free in Palmares in 1655 but was captured by the Portuguese and given to a missionary, Father Antônio Melo when he was approximately 6 years old. Baptized Francisco, Zumbi was taught the sacraments, learned Portuguese and Latin, and helped with daily mass. Despite attempts to \\"civilize\\" him, Zumbi escaped in 1670 and, at the age of 15, returned to his birthplace. Zumbi became known for his physical prowess and cunning in battle and was a respected military strategist by the time he was in his early twenties. By 1678, the governor of the captaincy of Pernambuco, Pedro Almeida, weary of the longstanding conflict with Palmares, approached its leader Ganga Zumba with an olive branch. Almeida offered freedom for all runaway slaves if Palmares would submit to Portuguese authority, a proposal which Ganga Zumba favored. But Zumbi was distrustful of the Portuguese. Further, he refused to accept freedom for the people of Palmares while other Africans remained enslaved. He rejected Almeida's overture and challenged Ganga Zumba's leadership. Vowing to continue the resistance to Portuguese oppression, Zumbi became the new leader of Palmares. Fifteen years after Zumbi assumed leadership of Palmares, Portuguese military commanders Domingos Jorge Velho and Vieira de Melo mounted an artillery assault on the quilombo. On February 6, 1694, after 67 years of ceaseless conflict with the cafuzos (Maroons) of Palmares, the Portuguese succeeded in destroying Cerca do Macaco, the republic's central settlement. Palmares' warriors were no match for the Portuguese artillery; the republic fell, and Zumbi was wounded. Though he survived and managed to elude the Portuguese, he was betrayed, captured almost two years later and beheaded on the spot on November 20, 1695. The Portuguese transported Zumbi's head to Recife, where it was displayed in the central praça as proof that, contrary to popular legend among African slaves, Zumbi was not immortal. It was also done as a warning of what would happen to others if they tried to be as brave as him. Remnants of the old quilombos continued to reside in the region for another hundred years. ===Gold and diamond rush=== Portuguese colonial Brazil gold coin from the southeastern Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. The discovery of gold in the early eighteenth century was met with great enthusiasm by Portugal, which had an economy in disarray following years of wars against Spain and the Netherlands.C. R. Boxer, \\"Brazilian Gold and British Traders in the First Half of the Eighteenth Century,\\" Hispanic American Historical Review (1969) 49#3 pp. 454–472 in JSTORC.R. Boxer, The golden age of Brazil, 1695–1750: growing pains of a colonial society (1962). A gold rush quickly ensued, with people from other parts of the colony and Portugal flooding the region in the first half of the eighteenth century. The large portion of the Brazilian inland where gold was extracted became known as the Minas Gerais (General Mines). Gold mining in this area became the main economic activity of colonial Brazil during the eighteenth century. In Portugal, the gold was mainly used to pay for industrialized goods (textiles, weapons) obtained from countries like England and, especially during the reign of King John V, to build Baroque monuments such as the Convent of Mafra. Minas Gerais was the gold mining center of Brazil, during the 18th century. Slave labor was generally used for the workforce.Kathleen J. Higgins, Licentious Liberty in a Brazilian Gold-Mining Region: Slavery, Gender & Social Control in Eighteenth-Century Sabara, Minas Gerais (1999) The discovery of gold in the area caused a huge influx of European immigrants and the government decided to bring in bureaucrats from Portugal to control operations. They set up numerous bureaucracies, often with conflicting duties and jurisdictions. The officials generally proved unequal to the task of controlling this highly lucrative industry.A. J. R. Russell-Wood, \\"Local Government in Portuguese America. A Study of Cultural Divergence,\\" Comparative Studies in Society & History (1974) 16#2 pp 187–231. Following Brazilian independence, the British pursued extensive economic activity in Brazil. In 1830, the Saint John d'El Rey Mining Company, controlled by the British, opened the largest gold mine in Latin America. The British brought in modern management techniques and engineering expertise. Located in Nova Lima, the mine produced ore for 125 years.Marshall C. Eakin, British Enterprise in Brazil: The St. John d'el Rey Mining Company & the Morro Velho Gold Mine, 1830–1960 (1990) Diamond deposits were found near Vila do Príncipe, around the village of Tijuco in the 1720s, and a rush to extract the precious stones ensued, flooding the European market. The Portuguese crown intervened to control production in Diamantina, the Diamond District. A system of bids for the right to extract diamonds was established, but in 1771, it was abolished and the crown retained the monopoly.A.J.R. Russell-Wood, \\"Brazil\\", p. 416. Mining stimulated regional growth in southern Brazil, not just from extraction of gold and diamonds, but the stimulation of food production for local consumption. More importantly it stimulated commerce and the development of merchant communities in port cities. Nominally, the Portuguese controlled the trade to Brazil, banning the establishment productive capacity for goods produced in Portugal. In practice, Portugal was an entrepôt for the import and export of goods from elsewhere, which were then re-exported to Brazil. Direct trade with foreign nations was forbidden, but prior to the Dutch incursion, much of Brazil's exports were carried in Dutch ships. After the American Revolution, U.S. ships called at Brazilian ports. When the Portuguese monarchy fled Iberia to Brazil in 1808 during the Napoleonic wars, one of the first acts of the monarch was to open Brazilian ports to foreign ships.José Luís Cardoso, \\"Free Trade, Political Economy and the Birth of a New Economic Nation: Brazil, 1808–1810.\\" Revista de Historia Económica-Journal of Iberian and Latin American Economic History 27#2 (2009): 183-204, online free in EnglishA.J.R. Russell-Wood, \\"Brazil\\", p. 419. ==The Kingdom and Empire of Brazil== Queen Maria I of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves Brazil was one of only three modern states in the Americas to have its own indigenous monarchy (the other two were Mexico and Haiti) – for a period of almost 90 years. As the Haitian Revolution for independence against the French crown was taking place in the late 1700s, Brazil, then a colony of Portugal, was also on the verge of starting their own revolution for independence. In the early 1790s, plots to overthrow the Portuguese colonial government flooded the streets of Brazil. Poor whites, a few upper-class whites, freed persons, slaves and mixed-race natives wanted to revolt against the Portuguese crown in order to abolish slavery, take power from the Catholic Church, end all forms of racial oppression, and establish a new governmental system that provided equal opportunities to all citizens. Though original plots had been foiled by royal authorities, Brazilians remained persistent in forming plots for revolutions after an outbreak of successful independence movements. The plan was similar to that of the French Revolutions, which by this time period had established the revolutionary rhetoric for much of the colonial world. However, the harsh punishment inflicted upon poor whites, working people of color, and slaves had silenced many voices of the revolution. As for the white elites, while some remained influenced by the revolutionary ideals spreading through France, others saw the incredible and intimidating strength of the lower classes through the Haitian Revolution, and feared that an uprising from their own lower class may lead to something equally as catastrophic to their society. It would not be until September 7, 1822, that Brazilian Prince Dom Pedro would declare Brazil as its own independent empire.Golden Law, Princess Isabel is greeted from the central balcony of the City Palace by a huge crowd below in the street. In 1808, the Portuguese court, fleeing from Napoleon's invasion of Portugal during the Peninsular War in a large fleet escorted by British men-of-war, moved the government apparatus to its then-colony, Brazil, establishing themselves in the city of Rio de Janeiro. From there the Portuguese king ruled his huge empire for 15 years, and there he would have remained for the rest of his life if it were not for the turmoil aroused in Portugal due, among other reasons, to his long stay in Brazil after the end of Napoleon's reign. In 1815 the king vested Brazil with the dignity of a united kingdom with Portugal and Algarves. In 1817 a revolt occurred in the province of Pernambuco. In two months it was suppressed. When king João VI of Portugal left Brazil to return to Portugal in 1821, his elder son, Pedro, stayed in his stead as regent of Brazil. One year later, Pedro stated the reasons for the secession of Brazil from Portugal and led the Independence War, instituted a constitutional monarchy in Brazil assuming its head as Emperor Pedro I of Brazil. Also known as \\"Dom Pedro I\\", after his abdication in 1831 for political incompatibilities (displeased, both by the landed elites, who thought him too liberal and by the intellectuals, who felt he was not liberal enough), he left for Portugal leaving behind his five-year-old son as Emperor Pedro II, which left the country ruled by regents between 1831 and 1840. This period was beset by rebellions of various motivations, such as the Sabinada, the Ragamuffin War, the Malê Revolt,Johns Hopkins University Press  BooksSlave Rebellion in Brazil Cabanagem and Balaiada, among others. After this period, Pedro II was declared of age and assumed his full prerogatives. Pedro II started a more-or- less parliamentary reign which lasted until 1889, when he was ousted by a coup d'état which instituted the republic in Brazil. Externally, apart from the Independence war, stood out decades of pressure from the United Kingdom for the country to end its participation in the Atlantic slave trade, and the wars fought in the region of La Plata river: the Cisplatine War (in 2nd half of the 1820s), the Platine War (in the 1850s), the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War (in the 1860s). This last war against Paraguay also was the bloodiest and most expensive in South American history, after which the country entered a period that continues to the present day, averse to external political and military interventions. ===Coffee plantations=== The coffee crop was introduced In 1720, and by 1850 Brazil was producing half of the world's coffee. The state set up a marketing board to protect and encourage the industry. Slaves on a fazenda (coffee farm), c. 1885 The major export crop in the 19th century was coffee, grown on large-scale plantations in the São Paulo area. The Zona da Mata Mineira district grew 90% of the coffee in Minas Gerais region during the 1880s and 70% during the 1920s. Most of the workers were black men, including both slaves and free. Increasingly Italian, Spanish and Japanese immigrants provided the expanded labour force.Thomas H. Holloway, Immigrants on the Land: Coffee & Society in Sao Paulo, 1886–1934 (1980)Alida C. Metcalf, \\"Coffee Workers In Brazil: A Review Essay,\\" Peasant Studies (1989) 16#3 pp 219–224, reviewing Verena Stolcke, Coffee Planters, Workers and Wives: Class Conflict and Gender Relations on São Paulo Plantations, 1850–1980 (1988) While railway lines were built to haul the coffee beans to market, they also provided essential internal transportation for both freight and passengers, as well as providing work opportunities for a large skilled labour force.Robert H. Mattoon, Jr., \\"Railroads, Coffee, and the Growth of Big Business in São Paulo, Brazil,\\" Hispanic American Historical Review (1977) 57#2 pp. 273–295 in JSTOR By the early 20th century, coffee accounted for 16% of Brazil's gross national product, and three quarters of its export earnings. The growers and exporters played major roles in politics; however, historians debate whether or not they were the most powerful actors in the political system.Renato Monseff Perissinotto, \\"State and Coffee Capital in São Paulo's Export Economy (Brazil 1889–1930)\\" Journal of Latin American Studies (2003) pp 1–23 in JSTOR Before the 1960s, historians generally ignored the coffee industry. Coffee was not a major industry in the colonial period. In any one particular locality, the coffee industry flourished for a few decades and then moved on as the soil lost its fertility; therefore it was not deeply embedded in the history of any one locality. After independence, coffee plantations were associated with slavery, underdevelopment, and a political oligarchy, and not the modern development of state and society.Steven Topik, \\"Where is the Coffee? Coffee and Brazilian Identity,\\"Luso-Brazilian Review (1999) 36#2 pp 87–92. Historians now recognize the importance of the industry, and there is a flourishing scholarly literature.Mauricio A. Font, Coffee and Transformation in Sao Paulo, Brazil (2012)Tania Andrade Lima, \\"Keeping a Tight Lid,\\" Review: A Journal of the Fernand Braudel Center (2011) 34#1–2, pp 193–215 ===Rubber=== The rubber boom in the Amazon in the 1880s–1910s radically reshaped the Amazonian economy. For example, it turned the remote poor jungle village of Manaus into a rich, sophisticated, progressive urban center, with a cosmopolitan population that patronized the theater, literary societies, and luxury stores, and supported good schools.E. Bradford Burns, \\"Manaus, 1910: Portrait of a Boom Town,\\" Journal of Inter-American Studies (1965) 7#3 pp. 400–421 in JSTOR In general, key characteristics of the rubber boom included the dispersed plantations, and a durable form of organization, yet did not respond to Asian competition. The rubber boom had major long-term effects: the private estate became the usual form of land tenure; trading networks were built throughout the Amazon basin; barter became a major form of exchange; and native peoples often were displaced. The boom firmly established the influence of the state throughout the region. The boom ended abruptly in the 1920s, and income levels returned to the poverty levels of the 1870s.Bradford L. Barham and Oliver T. Coomes, \\"Reinterpreting the Amazon Rubber Boom: Investment, the State, and Dutch Disease,\\" Latin American Research Review (1994) 29#2 pp. 73–109 in JSTOR There were major negative effects on the fragile Amazonian environment.Warren Dean, Brazil and the Struggle for Rubber: A Study in Environmental History (2002) ==RepublicOld Republic (1889–1930)=== Henrique Bernardelli: Marechal Deodoro da Fonseca, c. 1900 Pedro II was deposed on November 15, 1889, by a Republican military coup led by General Deodoro da Fonseca, who became the country's first de facto president through military ascension. The country's name became the Republic of the United States of Brazil (which in 1967 was changed to Federative Republic of Brazil). Two military presidents ruled through four years of dictatorship amid conflicts among the military and political elites (two Naval revolts, followed by a Federalist revolt), and an economic crisis due to the effects of the burst of a financial bubble, the encilhamento. From 1889 to 1930, although the country was formally a constitutional democracy, the First Republican Constitution, created in 1891, established that women and the illiterate (then the majority of the population) were prevented from voting. Presidentialism was adopted as the form of government and the State was divided into three powers (Legislative, Executive and Judiciary) \\"harmonic and independent of one another\\". The presidential term was fixed at four years, and the elections became direct. After 1894, the presidency of the republic was occupied by coffee farmers (oligarchies) from São Paulo and Minas Gerais, alternately. This policy was called política do café com leite (\\"coffee with milk\\" policy). The elections for president and governors was ruled by the Política dos Governadores (Governor's policy), in which they had mutual support to ensure the elections of some candidates. The exchanges of favors also happened among politicians and big landowners. They used the power to control the votes of population in return for favors (this was called coronelismo). Between 1893 and 1926 several movements, civilians and military, shook the country. The military movements had their origins both in the lower officers' corps of the Army and Navy (which, dissatisfied with the regime, called for democratic changes) while the civilian ones, such Canudos and Contestado War, were usually led by messianic leaders, without conventional political goals. Internationally, the country would stick to a course of conduct that extended throughout the twentieth century: an almost isolationist policy, interspersed with sporadic automatic alignments with major Western powers, its main economic partners, in moments of high turbulence. Standing out of this period: the resolution of the Acreanian's Question, its tiny role in the World War I, of which highlights the mission accomplished by its Navy on anti-submarine warfare,Scheina, Robert L.

Potomac Books, 2003 Part 4; Chapter 5 – World War I and Brazil, 1917–18. and an effort to play a leading role in the League of Nations.Ellis, Charles Howard \\"The origin, structure & working of the League of Nations\\" The LawBook Exchange Ltd 2003 pp. 105 & 145 ===Populism and development (1930–1964)=== After 1930, the successive governments continued industrial and agriculture growth and development of the vast interior of Brazil. Getúlio Vargas led a military junta that had taken control in 1930 and would remain to rule from 1930 to 1945 with the backing of Brazilian military, especially the Army. In this period, he faced internally the Constitutionalist Revolt in 1932 and two separate coup d'état attempts: by Communists in 1935 and by local right-wing elements of the Brazilian Integralism movement in 1938. Getúlio Vargas after the 1930 revolution, which began the Vargas era. The liberal revolution of 1930 overthrew the oligarchic coffee plantation owners and brought to power an urban middle class and business interests that promoted industrialization and modernization. Aggressive promotion of new industry turned around the economy by 1933. Brazil's leaders in the 1920s and 1930s decided that Argentina's implicit foreign policy goal was to isolate Portuguese-speaking Brazil from Spanish-speaking neighbors, thus facilitating the expansion of Argentine economic and political influence in South America. Even worse, was the fear that a more powerful Argentine Army would launch a surprise attack on the weaker Brazilian Army. To counter this threat, President Getúlio Vargas forged closer links with the United States. Meanwhile, Argentina moved in the opposite direction. During World War II, Brazil was a staunch ally of the United States and sent its military to Europe. The United States provided over $100 million in Lend-Lease grants, in return for free rent on air bases used to transport American soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic, and naval bases for anti-submarine operations. In sharp contrast, Argentina was officially neutral and at times favored Germany.Stanley E. Hilton, \\"The Argentine Factor in Twentieth-Century Brazilian Foreign Policy Strategy.\\" Political Science Quarterly 100.1 (1985): 27–51.Stanley E. Hilton, \\"Brazilian Diplomacy and the Washington-Rio de Janeiro 'Axis' during the World War II Era,\\" Hispanic American Historical Review (1979) 59#2 pp. 201–231 in JSTORHeadquarters of the National Congress of Brazil in 1959, during the construction of the new federal capital.A democratic regime prevailed from 1945–64. In the 1950s after Vargas' second period (this time, democratically elected), the country experienced an economic boom during Juscelino Kubitschek's years, during which the capital was moved from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília. Externally, after a relative isolation during the first half of the 1930s due to the effects of the 1929 Crisis, in the second half of the 1930s there was a rapprochement with the fascist regimes of Italy and Germany. However, after the fascist coup attempt in 1938 and the naval blockade imposed on these two countries by the British navy from the beginning of World War II, in the decade of 1940 there was a return to the old foreign policy of the previous period. During the early 1940s, Brazil joined the allied forces in the Battle of the Atlantic and the Italian Campaign; in the 1950s the country began its participation in the United Nations' peacekeeping missions\\"The United States and Brazil: A Long Road of Unmet Expectations\\"; Monica Hisrt, Routledge 2004 page 43 with Suez Canal in 1956 and in the beginning of the 1960s, during the presidency of Janio Quadros, its first attempts to break the automatic alignment (that had started in the 1940s) with the U.S.A.\\"The United States and Brazil: A Long Road of Unmet Expectations\\"; Monica Hisrt, Routledge 2004 , Introduction: page xviii 3rd paragraph The institutional crisis of succession for the presidency, triggered with the Quadros' resignation, coupled with other factors, such as a planned communist coup, would lead to the military intervention of 1964 and to the end of this period. ===Military dictatorship (1964–1985)=== New Professionalism and the Escola Superior de Guerra First page of the Institutional Act Number Five. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, success of revolutionary warfare techniques against conventional armies in China, Indochina, Algeria, and Cuba led the conventional armies in the developed and underdeveloped worlds to concentrate on finding military and political strategies to fight domestic revolutionary warfare. This led to an adoption of what Stepan called, in 1973, \\"New Professionalism.\\" The New Professionalism was formulated and propagated in Brazil through the Escola Superior de Guerra, which had been established in 1949. By 1963 New Professionalism had come to dominate the school, when it declared its primary mission to be preparing \\"civilians and the military to perform executive and advisory functions (Decreto Lei No. 53,080 December 4, 1963).\\" This new attitude towards professionalism arose out of nowhere. Though its domination of the ESG was completed by 1963, it had begun to penetrate the college much earlier than that — assisted by the United States and its policy of encouraging Latin American militaries to assume as their primary role in counter-guerrilla and counter-insurgency warfare programs, civic action and nation-building tasks.Stepan, 1973. By 1964, the military elite, unsatisfied with the delays, transfers, accommodations, and characteristics of the negotiation processes in democratic regimes, was eager to impose their development project. They saw a leftist revolution as a real possibility (through the paradigm of internal warfare doctrines of the new professionalism). Rising strike levels, the inflation rate, demands by the left for a broader political process, land reform, and the growing claims of the enlisted men were all seen as \\"evidence\\" that Brazil was facing the serious possibility of a leftist internal insurgency.\\"Anatomy of a coup d'etat; Brazil 1964\\"; Warren W. Van Pelt; Air War College, Air University (1967) ASIN B0007GYMM4 ===Military response=== A column of M41 Walker Bulldog tanks along the streets of Rio de Janeiro in April 1968. By early 1964 important sections of the military had developed a consensus that intervention in the political process was necessary. Important civilian politicians, such as José de Magalhães Pinto, governor of Minas Gerais, and the United States government, likely aided in the development of this consensus. Though many in the right of the political spectrum claim the coup was \\"revolutionary,\\" most historians agree that is not so, since there was no real transition of power; military dictatorship was the fastest way to implement economic policies in the country while suppressing growing popular discontent, and the coup was thus a way for Brazil's already-ruling elite to secure its power. At first, there was intense economic growth, due to economic reforms, but in the later years of the dictatorship, the reforms had left the economy in shambles, with soaring inequality and national debt, and thousands of Brazilians were deported, imprisoned, tortured,Brasil: Nunca Mais or murdered. Politically motivated deaths numbered in the hundreds, mostly related to the guerrilla-antiguerrilla warfare in the 1968–73 period; official censorship also led many artists into exile. Thousands of indigenous people were forcibly displaced or killed (intentionally or through diseases) amid an effort to build roads or hydroelectric dams on their lands.https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/09/brazils-bolsonaro- would-unleash-a-war-on-the-environment ==Redemocratization to present (1985–present)== Tancredo Neves was elected president in an indirect election in 1985 as the nation returned to civilian rule. He died before being sworn in, and the elected vice president, José Sarney, was sworn in as president in his place. Fernando Collor de Mello was the first elected president by popular vote after the military regime in December 1989 defeating Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in a two-round presidential race and 35 million votes. Collor won in the state of São Paulo against many prominent political figures. The first democratically elected President of Brazil in 29 years, Collor spent much of the early years of his government battling hyper-inflation, which at times reached rates of 25% per month. Collor's neoliberal program was also followed by his successor Fernando Henrique Cardoso \\"Tais políticas – iniciadas com a abertura do governo Collor – foram continuadas por Fernando Henrique Cardoso e Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, segundo economistas e industriais ouvidos pela Folha\\" who maintained free trade and privatization programs.Programa Nacional de Desestatização Collor's administration began the process of privatization of a number of government-owned enterprises such as Acesita, Embraer, Telebrás and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce.Os efeitos da privatização sobre o desempenho econômico e financeiro das empresas privatizadas With the exception of Acesita, the privatizations were all completed during the term of Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Following Collor's impeachment, acting president, Itamar Franco, was sworn in as president. In elections held on October 3, 1994, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, his finance minister, defeated left-wing Lula da Silva again. He was elected president due to the success of the so-called Plano Real. Reelected in 1998, he guided Brazil through a wave of financial crises. In 2000, Cardoso ordered the declassifying of some military files concerning Operation Condor, a network of South American military dictatorships that kidnapped and assassinated political opponents. Brazil's most severe problem today is arguably its highly unequal distribution of wealth and income, one of the most extreme in the world. By the 1990s, more than one out of four Brazilians continued to survive on less than one dollar a day. These socio-economic contradictions helped elect Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva of the Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT) in 2002. In the few months before the election, investors were scared by Lula's campaign platform for social change, and his past identification with labor unions and leftist ideology. As his victory became more certain, the Real devalued and Brazil's investment risk rating plummeted (the causes of these events are disputed, since Cardoso left a very small foreign reserve). After taking office, however, Lula maintained Cardoso's economic policies,Lula segue política econômica de FHC, diz diretor do FMI warning that social reforms would take years and that Brazil had no alternative but to extend fiscal austerity policies. The Real and the nation's risk rating soon recovered. Lula, however, has given a substantial increase in the minimum wage (raising from R$200 to R$350 in four years). Lula also spearheaded legislation to drastically cut retirement benefits for public servants. His primary significant social initiative, on the other hand, was the Fome Zero (Zero Hunger) program, designed to give each Brazilian three meals a day. In 2005 Lula's government suffered a serious blow with several accusations of corruption and misuse of authority against his cabinet, forcing some of its members to resign. Most political analysts at the time were certain that Lula's political career was doomed, but he managed to hold onto power, partly by highlighting the achievements of his term (e.g., reduction in poverty, unemployment and dependence on external resources, such as oil), and to distance himself from the scandal. Lula was re-elected President in the general elections of October 2006. The income of the poorest increased by 14% in 2004, with Bolsa Familia accounting for an estimated two- thirds of this growth. In 2004, Lula launched the \\"popular pharmacies\\" programme, designed to make medicines considered essential accessible to the most disadvantaged. He launched the Fome Zero (\\"Zero Hunger\\") programme, which provides poor families with access to basic food products through social assistance. During Lula's first term in office, child malnutrition declined by 46 per cent. In May 2010, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) awarded Lula da Silva the title of \\"world champion in the fight against hunger\\". ¿Cuál es el balance social de Lula? Having served two terms as president, Lula was forbidden by the Brazilian Constitution from standing again. In the 2010 presidential election, the PT candidate was Dilma Rousseff. Rousseff won and assumed office on January 1, 2011 as the country's first female president. Nationwide protests broke out in 2013 and 2014 primarily over public transport fares and government expenditures on the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Rousseff faced a conservative challenger for her re-election bid in the October 26, 2014, runoff,Jeffrey T. Lewis, \\"Brazil's Presidential Vote Looks Headed for Runoff,\\" Wall Street Journal Oct. 5, 2014 but managed to secure a re-election with just over 51% of votes.BBC News, \\"Dilma Rousseff Re-elected Brazilian President,\\" British Broadcasting Corporation Oct. 26, 2014 Protests resumed in 2015 and 2016 in response to a corruption scandal and a recession that began in 2014, resulting in the impeachment of President Rousseff for mismanagement and disregard of the national budget in August 2016. In 2016, Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics, making the city the first South American and Portuguese-speaking city to ever host the events, and the third time the Olympics were held in a Southern Hemisphere city. In October 2018, far-right congressman and former army captain Jair Bolsonaro was elected President of Brazil, disrupting sixteen years of continuous left-wing rule by the Worker's Party (PT). With an unprecedented corruption scandal eroding the public's trust of institutions, Bolsonaro's position as a political outsider along with his hardline ideology against crime and corruption helped him win the presidential election, despite his past misogynist or racist remarks and his admiration for the 21-year military dictatorship. During Bolsonaro's first year as president, deforestation of the Amazon rainforest reached its highest level in 11 years in spite of the rainforest's important role in mitigating climate change. Bolsonaro's policies of increasing industry in the Amazon and the use of the slash-and-burn method for clearing forest areas eventually lead to an overwhelming increase in Amazon rainforest wildfires in 2019 compared to previous years. ===Religious change=== Until recently Catholicism was overwhelmingly dominant. Rapid change in the 21st century has led to a growth in secularism (no religious affiliation). Just as dramatic is the sudden rise of evangelical Protestantism to over 22% of the population. The 2010 census indicates that fewer than 65% of Brazilians consider themselves Catholic, down from 90% in 1970. The decline is associated with falling birth rates to one of Latin America's lowest at 1.83 children per woman, which is below replacement levels. It has led Cardinal Cláudio Hummes to comment, \\"We wonder with anxiety: how long will Brazil remain a Catholic country?\\"Simon Romero, \\"A Laboratory for Revitalizing Catholicism,\\" The New York Times Feb 14, 2013 ==See also== *List of Brazilian monarchs *List of Presidents of Brazil *Politics of Brazil *Rebellions and revolutions in Brazil *History of Brazilian nationality *Timeline of Brazilian history General: *History of the Americas *History of Latin America *History of South America *Portuguese colonization of the Americas ==ReferencesNotesFurther reading== *Alden, Dauril.

","title":"History of Brazil"},{"id":"19283960","text":"Argentina is a country on the south coast of south America. The history of Argentina can be divided into four main parts: the pre-Columbian time or early history (up to the sixteenth century), the colonial period (1530–1810), the period of nation-building (1810-1880), and the history of modern Argentina (from around 1880). Prehistory in the present territory of Argentina began with the first human settlements on the southern tip of Patagonia around 13,000 years ago. Written history began with the arrival of Spanish chroniclers in the expedition of Juan Díaz de Solís in 1516 to the Río de la Plata, which marks the beginning of Spanish occupation of this region. In 1776 the Spanish Crown established the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, an umbrella of territories from which, with the Revolution of May 1810, began a process of gradual formation of several independent states, including one called the United Provinces of Río de la Plata. With the declaration of independence on July 9, 1816 and the military defeat of the Spanish Empire in 1824, a federal state was formed in 1853–1861, known today as the Argentine Republic. ==Pre-Columbian era== The area now known as Argentina was relatively sparsely populated until the period of European colonization. The earliest traces of human life are dated from the Paleolithic period, and there are further signs in the Mesolithic and Neolithic.Santillán, p. 17 However, large areas of the interior and Piedmont were apparently depopulated during an extensive dry period between 4000 and 2000 B.C.A Gil, M Zárate & G Neme (2005), Mid-Holocene paleoenvironments and the archeological record of southern Mendoza, Argentina. Quat. Intern. 132: 81-94. The Uruguayan archaeologist Raúl Campá Soler divided the indigenous peoples in Argentina into three main groups: basic hunters and food gatherers, without the development of pottery; advanced gatherers and hunters; and basic farmers with pottery.Santillán, p. 18-19 The first group could be found in the Pampas and Patagonia, and the second one included the Charrúa and Minuane and the Guaraní. In the late 15th century, the Native tribes of the Quebrada de Humahuaca were conquered by the Inca Empire, under Topa Inca Yupanqui, to secure the supply of metals such as silver, zinc, and copper. The Incan domination of the area lasted for about half a century and ended with the arrival of the Spanish in 1536. ==Spanish colonial era== Europeans first arrived in the region with the 1502 Portuguese voyage of Gonçalo Coelho and Amerigo Vespucci. Around 1512, João de Lisboa and Estevão de Fróis discovered the Rio de La Plata in present-day Argentina, exploring its estuary, contacting the Charrúa people, and bringing the first news of the \\"people of the mountains\\", the Inca empire, obtained from the local natives. They also traveled as far south as the Gulf of San Matias at 42ºS, on the northern shores of Patagonia. The Spanish, led by Juan Díaz de Solís, visited the territory which is now Argentina in 1516. In 1536 Pedro de Mendoza established a small settlement at the modern location of Buenos Aires, which was abandoned in 1541.Mitre, p. 8-9 A second one was established in 1580 by Juan de Garay, and Córdoba in 1573 by Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera. Those regions were part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, whose capital was Lima, and settlers arrived from that city. Unlike the other regions of South America, the colonization of the Río de la Plata estuary was not influenced by any gold rush, since it lacked any precious metals to mine. The natural ports on the Río de la Plata estuary could not be used because all shipments were meant to be made through the port of Callao near Lima, a condition that led to contraband becoming the normal means of commerce in cities such as Asunción, Buenos Aires, and Montevideo.Abad de Santillán, p. 391 The Spanish raised the status of this region by establishing the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776. This viceroyalty consisted of today's Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, as well as much of present-day Bolivia. Buenos Aires, now holding the customs of the new political subdivision, became a flourishing port, as the revenues from the Potosí, the increasing maritime activity in terms of goods rather than precious metals, the production of cattle for the export of leather and other products, and other political reasons, made it gradually become one of the most important commercial centers of the region. The viceroyalty was, however, short-lived due to lack of internal cohesion among its many regions and lack of Spanish support. Ships from Spain became scarce again after the Spanish defeat at the battle of Trafalgar, that gave the British maritime supremacy. The British tried to invade Buenos Aires and Montevideo in 1806 and 1807, but were defeated both times by Santiago de Liniers. Those victories, achieved without help from mainland Spain, boosted the confidence of the city.Luna, Independencia..., p. 28 The beginning of the Peninsular War in Spain and the capture of the Spanish king Ferdinand VII created great concern all around the viceroyalty. It was thought that, without a King, people in America should rule themselves. This idea led to multiple attempts to remove the local authorities at Chuquisaca, La Paz, Montevideo and Buenos Aires, all of which were short-lived. A new successful attempt, the May Revolution of 1810, took place when it was reported that all of Spain, with the exception of Cádiz and León, had been conquered. ==War of independence== Portrait of José de San Martín. The May Revolution ousted the viceroy. Other forms of government, such as a constitutional monarchy or a Regency were briefly considered. The viceroyalty was also renamed, and it nominally became the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. However, the status of the different territories that had belonged to the viceroyalty changed many times during the course of the war, as some regions would remain loyal to their previous governors and others were captured or recaptured; later these would split into several countries. The first military campaigns against the royalists were waged by Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli. The Primera Junta, after expanding to become the Junta Grande, was replaced by the First Triumvirate. A Second Triumvirate would replace it years later, calling for the Assembly of year XIII that was meant to declare independence and write a constitution. However, it did not do either, and replaced the triumvirates with a single head of state office, the Supreme Director. By this time José de San Martín arrived in Buenos Aires with other generals of the Peninsular War. They gave new strength to the Revolutionary war, which was marked by the defeat of Belgrano and Castelli and the royalist resistance at the Banda Oriental. Alvear took Montevideo, and San Martín started a military campaign that would span an important part of the Spanish territories in America. He created the Army of the Andes in Mendoza and, with the help of Bernardo O'Higgins and other Chileans, he made the Crossing of the Andes and liberated Chile. With the Chilean navy at his disposal, he moved to Peru, liberating that country as well. San Martín met Simón Bolívar at Guayaquil, and retired from action. A new assembly, the Congress of Tucumán, was called while San Martín was preparing the crossing of the Andes. It finally declared independence from Spain or any other foreign power. Bolivia declared itself independent in 1825, and Uruguay was created in 1828 as a result of the Cisplatine War. The United Kingdom officially recognized Argentine independence in 1825, with the signing of a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation on February 2; the British chargé d'affaires in Buenos Aires, Woodbine Parish, signed on behalf of his country. Spanish recognition of Argentine independence was not to come for several decades. == Historical map == The map below is based on a wide range of antique maps for the periods shown and is intended to give a broad idea of the changes in the State of Argentina in the nineteenth century.

Unitarians thought that Buenos Aires should lead the less- developed provinces, as the head of a strong centralized government. Federalists thought instead that the country should be a federation of autonomous provinces, like the United States. During this period, the government would kidnap protestors, and torture them for information. During this period, the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata lacked a head of state, since the unitarian defeat at the Battle of Cepeda had ended the authority of the Supreme Directors and the 1819 Constitution. There was a new attempt in 1826 to write a constitution, leading to the designation of Bernardino Rivadavia as President of Argentina, but it was rejected by the provinces. Rivadavia resigned due to the poor management at the Cisplatine War, and the 1826 constitution was repealed. During this time, the Governors of Buenos Aires Province received the power to manage the international relations of the confederation, including war and debt payment. The dominant figure of this period was the federalist Juan Manuel de Rosas, who is portrayed from different angles by the diverse historiographic flows in Argentina: liberal history usually considers him a dictator, while revisionists support him on the grounds of his defense of national sovereignty. He ruled the province of Buenos Aires from 1829 to 1852, facing military threats from secession attempts, neighboring countries, and even European nations. Although Rosas was a Federalist, he kept the customs receipts of Buenos Aires under the exclusive control of the city, whereas the other provinces expected to have a part of the revenue. Rosas considered this a fair measure because only Buenos Aires was paying the external debt generated by the Baring Brothers loan to Rivadavia, the war of independence and the war against Brazil. He developed a paramilitary force of his own, the Popular Restorer Society, commonly known as \\"Mazorca\\" (\\"Corncob\\"). Rosas' reluctance to call for a new assembly to write a constitution led General Justo José de Urquiza from Entre Ríos to turn against him. Urquiza defeated Rosas during the battle of Caseros and called for such an assembly. The Argentine Constitution of 1853 is, with amendments, still in force to this day. The Constitution was not immediately accepted by Buenos Aires, which seceded from the Confederation; it rejoined a few years later. In 1862 Bartolomé Mitre became the first president of the unified country. ==Liberal Governments (1862–1880)== President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. The presidency of Bartolomé Mitre saw an economic improvement in Argentina, with agricultural modernization, foreign investment, new railroads and ports and a wave of immigration from Europe. Mitre also stabilized the political system by commanding federal interventions that defeated the personal armies of caudillos Chacho Peñaloza and Juan Sáa. Argentina joined Uruguay and Brazil against Paraguay in the War of the Triple Alliance, which ended during Sarmiento's rule with the defeat of Paraguay and the annexation of part of its territory by Argentina. Despite victory in the war, Mitre's popularity declined severely because a broad section of the Argentine population was opposed to the war due to the alliance with Brazil (Argentina's historic rival) that took place during the war, and the betrayal of Paraguay (which had been until then one of the country's most important economic allies). One of the major hallmarks of Mitre's presidency was the \\"Law of Compromise\\", in which Buenos Aires joined the Argentine Republic and allowed the government to use the City of Buenos Aires as the center of government, but without federalizing the city and by reserving the right of the province of Buenos Aires to secede from the nation if conflict arose. In 1868 Mitre was succeeded by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who promoted public education, culture, telegraphs ; as well as the modernization of the Army and the Navy. Sarmiento managed to defeat the last known caudillos and also dealt with the fallout of the Triple Alliance War, which included a decrease in national production due to the death of thousands of soldiers and an outbreak of diseases, such as cholera and yellow fever, brought by returning soldiers. In 1874 Nicolás Avellaneda became president and ran into trouble when he had to deal with the economic depression left by the Panic of 1873. Most of these economic issues were solved when new land was opened for development after the expansion of national territory through the Conquest of the Desert, led by his war minister Julio Argentino Roca. This military campaign took most of the territories under the control of natives, and reduced their population. In 1880 a trade conflict caused turmoil in Buenos Aires, which led governor Carlos Tejedor to declare secession from the republic. Avellaneda denied them this right, breaking the Law of Compromise, and proceeded to send army troops led by Roca to take over the province. Tejedor's secession efforts were defeated and Buenos Aires joined the republic definitively, federalizing the city of Buenos Aires and handing it over to the government as the nation's capital city. ==National Autonomist hegemony (1880–1916)== President Julio Argentino Roca, the central political figure of the PAN Hegemony years. After his surge in popularity due to his successful desert campaign, Julio Roca was elected president in 1880 as the candidate for the National Autonomist Party (Partido Autonomista Nacional - PAN), a party that would remain in power until 1916. During his presidency, Roca created a net of political alliances and installed several measures that helped him retain almost absolute control of the Argentine political scene throughout the 1880s. This keen ability with political strategy earned him his nickname of \\"The Fox\\". The country's economy benefited from a change from extensive farming to industrial agriculture and a huge European immigration, but there wasn't yet a strong move towards industrialization. At that time, Argentina received some of the highest levels of foreign investment in Latin America. In the midst of this economic expansion, the Law 1420 of Common Education of 1884 guaranteed universal, free, non-religious education to all children. This and other government policies were strongly opposed by the Roman Catholic Church in Argentina, causing the Holy See to break off diplomatic relations with the country for several years and setting the stage for decades of continued Church–state strain. In the late 19th and early 20th century, Argentina temporarily resolved its border disputes with Chile with the Puna de Atacama dispute of 1899, the Boundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina and the 1902 General Treaty of Arbitration. Roca's government and those that followed were aligned with the Argentine oligarchy, especially the great land owners. Under General Roca, the Conquest of the Desert extended Argentine power into Patagonia. In 1888, Miguel Juárez Celman became president after Roca was constitutionally disqualified from re-election; Celman attempted to reduce Roca's control over the political scene, which earned him his predecessor's opposition. Roca led a great opposition movement against Celman, which coupled with the devastating effects that the Long Depression had on the Argentine economy, allowed the Civic opposition party to start a coup d'état which would be later known as the Revolution of the Park. The Revolution was led by the three main leaders of the Civic Union, Leandro Alem, former president Bartolomé Mitre and moderate socialist Juan B. Justo. Though it failed in its main goals, the revolution forced Juárez Celman's resignation and marked the decline of the Generation of '80. In 1891, Roca proposed that the Civic Union elect someone to be vice-president to his own presidency the next time elections came around. One group led by Mitre decided to take the deal, while another more intransigent group led by Alem was opposed. This eventually led to the split of the Civic Union into the National Civic Union (Argentina), led by Mitre, and the Radical Civic Union, led by Alem. After this division occurred, Roca withdrew his offer, having completed his plan to divide the Civic Union and decrease their power. Alem would eventually commit suicide in 1896; control of the Radical Civic Union went to his nephew and protégé, Hipólito Yrigoyen. After Celman's downfall, his vice-president Carlos Pellegrini took over and proceeded to resolve the economic crisis which afflicted the country, earning him the moniker of \\"The Storm Sailor\\". Fearing another wave of opposition from Roca like the one imposed on Celman, Pellegrini remained moderate in his presidency ending his predecessor's efforts to distance \\"The Fox\\" from political control. The following governments up until 1898 took similar measures and sided with Roca to avoid being politically chastised. In 1898, Roca became president again in a politically unstable situation, with a large number of social conflicts that included massive strikes and anarchist subversion attempts. Roca handled most of these conflicts by having the police or the army crack down on protestors, rebels and suspected rebels. After the end of his second presidency, Roca fell ill and his role in political affairs began to decrease gradually until his death in late 1914. In 1904, Alfredo Palacios, a member of Juan B. Justo's Socialist Party (founded in 1896), became the first Socialist deputy in Argentina, as a representative for the working-class neighborhood of La Boca in Buenos Aires. He helped create many laws, including the Ley Palacios against sexual exploitation, and others regulating child and woman labor, working hours and Sunday rest. Unión Cívica Radical's 1893 and 1905 revolts, led by Hipólito Yrigoyen, inflicted fear among the oligarchy of an increased social instability and a possible revolution. Being a progressive member of the PAN, Roque Sáenz Peña recognized the need to satisfy the demand by public to maintain the existing regime. After being elected as President in 1910, he passed the Sáenz Peña Law in 1912 which made the political vote mandatory, secret and universal among males aged eighteen or more. His intention was not to allow the transition of power to Unión Cívica Radical but to increase public support for the PAN by enabling the universal electoral suffrage. However, the consequence was the opposite of what he intended to accomplish: The following election chose Hipólito Yrigoyen as the president in 1916, and it ended the hegemony of the PAN. ==Radical governments (1916–30)== President Hipólito Yrigoyen. Conservative forces dominated Argentine politics until 1916, when the Radicals, led by Hipólito Yrigoyen, won control of the government through the first national elections under universal male suffrage. 745,000 citizens were allowed to vote, of a total population of 7.5 million (immigrants, who represented much of the population, were not allowed to vote); of these, 400,000 abstained.Felipe Pigna, Los Mitos de la Historia Argentina, 3, 2006, ed. Planeta, p.38 Yrigoyen, however, only obtained 45% of the votes, which did not allow him a majority in Parliament, where the conservatives remained the leading force. Thus, of 80 draft laws proposed by the executive, only 26 were voted through by the conservative majority.Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.42 A moderate agricultural reform proposal was rejected by Parliament, as was an income tax on interest, and the creation of a Bank of the Republic (which was to have the missions of the current Central Bank). Despite this conservative opposition, the Radical Civic Union (UCR), with their emphasis on fair elections and democratic institutions, opened their doors to Argentina's expanding middle class as well as to social groups previously excluded from power. Yrigoyen's policy was to \\"fix\\" the system, by enacting necessary reforms which would enable the agroindustrial export model to preserve itself.Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.39 It alternated moderate social reforms with repression of the social movements. In 1918, a student movement started at the University of Córdoba, which eventually led to the University Reform, which quickly spread to the rest of Latin America. In May '68, French students recalled the Córdoba movement.Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.51 The Tragic Week of January 1919, during which the Argentine Regional Workers' Federation (FORA, founded in 1901) had called for a general strike after a police shooting, ended with 700 killed and 4,000 injured.Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.88 General Luis Dellepiane marched on Buenos Aires to re-establish civil order. Despite being called on by some to initiate a coup against Yrigoyen, he remained loyal to the President, on the sole condition that the latter would allow him a free hand in the repression of the demonstrations. Social movements thereafter continued in the Forestal British company, and in Patagonia, where Hector Varela headed the military repression, assisted by the Argentine Patriotic League, killing 1,500.Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.100 On the other hand, Yrigoyen's administration enacted the Labor Code establishing the right to strike in 1921, implemented minimum wage laws and collective contracts. It also initiated the creation of the Dirección General de Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF), the state oil company, in June 1922. Radicalism rejected class struggle and advocated social conciliation.Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.44 Meanwhile, the Radicals continued Argentina's neutrality policy during World War I, despite the United States urging them to declare war against the Central Powers. Neutrality enabled Argentina to export goods to Europe, in particular to Great Britain, as well as to issue credit to the belligerent powers. Germany sank two Argentine civilian ships, Monte Protegido on April 4, 1917 and the Toro, but the diplomatic incident ended only with the expulsion of the German ambassador, Karl von Luxburg. Yrigoyen organized a Conference of Neutral Powers in Buenos Aires, to oppose the United States' attempt to bring American states in the European war, and also supported Sandino's resistance in Nicaragua.Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.58 In September 1922, Yrigoyen's administration refused to follow the cordon sanitaire policy enacted against the Soviet Union, and, basing its policy on the assistance given to Austria after the war, decided to send to the USSR 5 million pesos in assistance.Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.59 The same year, Yrigoyen was replaced by his rival inside the UCR, Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear, an aristocrat, who defeated Norberto Piñero's Concentración Nacional (conservatives) with 458,457 votes to 200,080. Alvear brought to his cabinet personalities belonging to the traditional ruling classes, such as José Nicolás Matienzo at the Interior Ministry, Ángel Gallardo in Foreign Relations, Agustín P. Justo at the War Ministry, Manuel Domecq García at the Marine and Rafael Herrera Vegas at the Haciendas. Alvear's supporters founded the Unión Cívica Radical Antipersonalista, opposed to Yrigoyen's party. During the early 1920s, the rise of the anarchist movement, fueled by the arrival of recent émigrés and deportees from Europe, spawned a new generation of left-wing activism in Argentina. The new left, mostly anarchists and anarcho-communists, rejected the incremental progressivism of the old Radical and Socialist elements in Argentina in favor of immediate action. The extremists, such as Severino Di Giovanni, openly espoused violence and 'propaganda by the deed'. A wave of bombings and shootouts with police culminated in an attempt to assassinate U.S. President Herbert Hoover on his visit to Argentina in 1928 and a nearly successful attempt to assassinate Yrigoyen in 1929 after he was re-elected to the presidency. In 1921, the counter-revolutionary Logia General San Martín was founded, and diffused nationalist ideas in the military until its dissolution in 1926. Three years later, the Liga Republicana (Republican League) was founded by Roberto de Laferrère, on the model of Benito Mussolini's Blackshirts in Italy. The Argentine Right found its major influences in the 19th-century Spanish writer Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo and in the French royalist Charles Maurras.Felipe Pigna, 2006, p.125-128 Also in 1922, the poet Leopoldo Lugones, who had turned towards fascism, made a famous speech in Lima, known as \\"the time of the sword\\", in the presence of the War Minister and future dictator Agustín P. Justo, which called for a military coup and the establishment of a military dictatorship. In 1928, Yrigoyen was re-elected as president and began a series of reforms to increase workers' rights. This intensified the conservative opposition against Yrigoyen, which grew even stronger after Argentina was devastated by the beginning of the Great Depression after the Wall Street Crash. On September 6, 1930, a military coup led by the pro-fascist general José Félix Uriburu overthrew Yrigoyen's government and began a period in Argentine history known as the Infamous Decade. During the Great Depression, exports of frozen beef, especially to Great Britain, provided much needed foreign currency, but trade fell off sharply.E. G. Jones, \\"The Argentine Refrigerated Meat Industry,\\" Economica (1929) #26 pp. 156-172 in JSTOR ==Infamous Decade (1930–43)== Sarmiento and the Ministry of Defense, Buenos Aires. In 1929, Argentina was wealthy by world standards, but the prosperity ended after 1929 with the worldwide Great Depression. In 1930, a military coup, supported by the Argentine Patriotic League, forced Hipólito Yrigoyen from power, and replaced him with José Félix Uriburu. Support for the coup was bolstered by the sagging Argentine economy, as well as a string of bomb attacks and shootings involving radical anarchists, which alienated moderate elements of Argentine society and angered the conservative right, which had long been agitating for decisive action by the military forces. The military coup initiated during the period known as the \\"Infamous Decade\\", characterized by electoral fraud, persecution of the political opposition (mainly against the UCR) and pervasive government corruption, against the background of the global depression. During his brief tenure as president, Uriburu cracked down heavily on anarchists and other far- left groups, resulting in 2,000 illegal executions of members of anarchist and communist groups. The most famous (and perhaps most symbolic of anarchism's decay in Argentina at the time) was the execution of Severino Di Giovanni, who was captured in late January 1931 and executed on the first of February of the same year. After becoming president through the coup, Uriburu attempted to create a constitutional reform that would include corporatism in the Argentine Constitution. This move toward fascism was viewed negatively by the conservative backers of the coup and they turned their support to the more moderate conservative general Agustín P. Justo, who won the presidency in a 1932 election that was heavily fraudulent. Justo began a policy of liberal economic moves that primarily benefitted the nation's upper classes and permitted great political and industrial corruption at the expense of national growth. One of the most infamous decisions of Justo's government was the creation of the Roca–Runciman Treaty between Argentina and the United Kingdom, which benefitted the British economy and the rich beef producers of Argentina. In 1935, progressive democrat Senator Lisandro de la Torre began an investigation into several corruption allegations within the Argentine beef production industry, during which he attempted to charge Justo's Minister of Agriculture, Luis Duhau, and the Minister of Finance, Federico Pinedo, with political corruption and fraud charges. During the exposition of the investigation in the National Congress, Duhau started a fight among the senators, during which his bodyguard, Ramón Valdez-Cora, tried to kill De La Torre but accidentally ended up shooting De La Torre's friend and political partner Enzo Bordabehere. The meat investigation was dropped soon afterward, but not before De La Torre managed to achieve the incarceration of the head of the Anglo meat company for corruption charges. De la Torre would later commit suicide in 1939. The collapse of international trade led to industrial growth focused on import substitution, leading to a stronger economic independence. Political conflict increased, marked by confrontation between right-wing fascists and leftist radicals, while military-oriented conservatives controlled the government. Though many claimed the polls to be fraudulent, Roberto Ortiz was elected president in 1937 and took office the next year, but due to his fragile health he was succeeded by his vice-president, Ramón Castillo. Castillo effectively took power in 1940; he formally assumed leadership in 1942. ==Revolution of '43 (1943–46)== The civilian government appeared to be close to joining the Allies, but many officers of the Argentine armed forces (and ordinary Argentine citizens) objected due to fear of the spread of communism. There was a wide support to stay neutral in the conflict, as during World War I. The government was also questioned for domestic policy reasons, namely, electoral fraud, poor labour rights, and the selection of Patrón Costas to run for the presidency. On June 4, 1943, the United Officers' Group (GOU), which was a secret alliance between military leaders led by Pedro Pablo Ramírez, Arturo Rawson, Edelmiro Farrell, and Farrell's protégé Juan Perón, marched to the Casa Rosada and demanded the resignation of president Castillo. After hours of threats, their goal was achieved and the president resigned. This event is considered by historians to be the official end of the Infamous Decade. After the coup, Ramírez took power. Although he did not declare war, he broke off relations with the Axis powers. Argentina's largest neighbor, Brazil, had already entered the war on the Allied side in 1942. In 1944 Ramirez was replaced by Farrell, an army officer of Irish-Argentine origin who had spent two years attached to Mussolini's army in the twenties. Initially, his government continued to maintain a neutral policy. Towards the end of the war, Farrell decided it was in the interests of Argentina to be attached to the winning side. Like several Latin American states, Argentina made a late declaration of war against Germany with no intention of providing any military forces. Juan Perón managed relations with labourers and unions, and became highly popular. He was deposed and detained on Martín García Island, but a massive demonstration on October 17, 1945, forced the government to free Perón and restore him to office. Perón would win the elections shortly afterward by a landslide. The US ambassador, Spruille Braden, took direct action in Argentine politics supporting the antiperonist parties. ==Peronist years (1946–55)== President Juan Perón (1946). In 1946 General Juan Perón became president; his populist ideology became known as peronism. His popular wife Eva Perón played a leading political role until her death in 1952.Barnes, John. Evita, First Lady: A Biography of Eva Perón. New York: Grove Press, 1978. Perón established censorship by closing down 110 publications between 1943 and 1946. During Juan Perón's rule, the number of unionized workers and government programs increased. His government followed an isolationist foreign policy and attempted to reduce the political and economic influence of other nations. Perón expanded government spending. His policies led to ruinous inflation. The peso lost about 70% of its value from early 1948 to early 1950; inflation reached 50% in 1951.INDEC (precios) Opposition members were imprisoned and some of them tortured.Feitlowitz, Marguerite. A Lexicon of Terror: Argentina and the Legacies of Torture. Oxford University Press, 2002. He dismissed many important and capable advisers, while promoting officials largely on the basis of personal loyalty. A coup (Revolución Libertadora) led by Eduardo Lonardi, and supported by the Catholic Church, deposed him in 1955. He went into exile, eventually settling in Francoist Spain. ==Revolución Libertadora (1955–1958)== In Argentina, the 1950s and 1960s were marked by frequent coups d'état, low economic growth in the 1950s and high growth rates in the 1960s. Argentina faced problems of continued social and labor demands. Argentine painter Antonio Berni's works reflected the social tragedies of these times, painting in particular life in the villas miseria (shanty towns). Following the Revolución Libertadora military coup, Eduardo Lonardi held power only briefly and was succeeded by Pedro Aramburu, president from November 13, 1955, to May 1, 1958. In June 1956, two Peronist generals, Juan José Valle and Raul Tanco, attempted a coup against Aramburu, criticizing an important purge in the army, the abrogation of social reforms and persecution of trade-union leaders. They also demanded liberation of all political and labor activists and a return to constitutional order. The uprising was quickly crushed. General Valle and other members of the military were executed, and twenty civilians were arrested at their homes and their bodies were thrown in the León Suarez dumping ground. Along with the June 1955 Casa Rosada bombing on the Plaza de Mayo, the León Suarez massacre is one of the important events that started a cycle of violence. Pedro Aramburu was later kidnapped and executed for this massacre, in 1970, by Fernando Abal Medina, Emilio Angel Maza, Mario Firmenich and others, who would later form the Montoneros movement.Julio A. Troxler, a \\"revolutionary Peronist\\", was one of the few men who escaped the massacre. All the others were dumped in León Suarez, in Buenos Aires Province. Rodolfo Walsh noted Troxler's testimony in Operation Massacre. In 1973, under Cámpora's government, Troxler became Buenos Aires police chief, but was assassinated by the Triple A during Isabel Perón's government. Rodolfo Walsh was murdered after Videla's 1976 coup. In 1956, special elections were held to reform the constitution. The Radical Party under Ricardo Balbín won a majority, although 25% of all ballots were turned in the blank as a protest by the banned Peronist party. Also in support of Peronism, the left wing of the Radical Party, led by Arturo Frondizi, left the Constitutional Assembly. The Assembly was severely damaged by this defection and was only able to restore the Constitution of 1853 with the sole addition of the Article 14 bis, which enumerated some social rights. ==Fragile radical administrations (1958–1966)== President Arturo Frondizi. A ban on Peronist expression and representation continued during the fragile civilian governments of the period 1958–1966. Frondizi, UCRI's candidate, won the presidential elections of 1958, obtaining approximately 4,000,000 votes against 2,500,000 for Ricardo Balbín (with 800,000 neutral votes). From Caracas, Perón supported Frondizi and called upon his supporters to vote for him, as a means toward the end of prohibition of the Peronist movement and the re-establishment of the workers' social legislation voted during Perón's leadership. On one hand, Frondizi appointed Álvaro Alsogaray as Minister of Economy to placate powerful agrarian interests and other conservatives. A member of the powerful military dynasty Alsogaray, Álvaro, who had already been Minister of Industry under Aramburu's military rule, devalued the peso and imposed credit control. On the other hand, Frondizi followed a laicist program, which raised concerns among the Catholic nationalist forces, leading to the organization, between 1960 and 1962, of the far-right Tacuara Nationalist Movement. The Tacuara, the \\"first urban guerrilla group in Argentina\\",Daniel Gutman, Tacuara, historia de la primera guerrilla urbana argentina engaged in several anti-Semitic bombings, in particular following Adolf Eichmann's kidnapping by the Mossad in 1960. During the visit of Dwight Eisenhower to Argentina, in February 1962 (Eisenhower had been until 1961 President of the United States), the Tacuara headed nationalist demonstrations against him, leading to the imprisonment of several of their leaders, among them Joe Baxter.Baxter, José Luis entry at the Dictionary of Irish Latin American Biography The ousting of President Arturo Illia was initially broadly supported but later deeply regretted by the Argentine population. However, Frondizi's government ended in 1962 with intervention yet again by the military, after a series of local elections were won by the Peronist candidates. José María Guido, chairman of the senate, claimed the presidency on constitutional grounds before the deeply divided armed forces were able to agree on a name. Right-wing elements in the Argentine armed forces in favor of direct military rule and the suppression of former Peronist politicians, subsequently attempted to wrest control of the government in the 1963 Argentine Navy Revolt on April 2. The failure of the revolt's plotters to win the loyalty of army units near the capital permitted Guido's government to swiftly put down the revolt at the cost of 21 lives. In new elections in 1963, neither Peronists nor Communists were allowed to participate. Arturo Illia of the Radical People's Party won these elections; regional elections and by-elections over the next few years favored Peronists. On the other hand, the Tacuara were outlawed by Illia in 1965, some of its members ultimately turning to the Peronist Left (such as Joe Baxter) while others remained in their far-right positions (such as Alberto Ezcurra Uriburu, who would work with the Triple A). Despite the fact that the country grew and developed economically during Illia's tenure as president, he was eventually ousted in a military coup in 1966. ==Revolución Argentina (1966–73)== Amidst growing worker and student unrest, another coup took place in June 1966, self- designated Revolución Argentina (Argentine Revolution), which established General Juan Carlos Onganía as de facto president, supported by several leaders of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), among these the general secretary, Augusto Vandor. This led to a series of military-appointed presidents. While preceding military coups were aimed at establishing temporary, transitional juntas, the Revolución Argentina headed by Onganía aimed at establishing a new political and social order, opposed both to liberal democracy and communism, which gave to the Armed Forces of Argentina a leading, political role in the economic rationalization of the country. The political scientist Guillermo O'Donnell named this type of regime an \\"authoritarian-bureaucratic state\\",Guillermo O'Donnell, El Estado Burocrático Autoritario, (1982) in reference both to the Revolución Argentina, the Brazilian military regime (1964–85), Augusto Pinochet's regime (starting in 1973) and Juan María Bordaberry's regime in Uruguay. Onganía's Minister of Economy, Adalbert Krieger Vasena, decreed a wage freeze and a 40% devaluation of the currency, which strongly affected the state of the Argentine economy, in particular the agricultural sector, favoring foreign capital. Vasena suspended collective labour conventions, reformed the hydrocarbon law which had established a partial monopoly of the Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) state enterprise, as well as passing a law facilitating expulsions in case of failure to pay rent. Finally, the right to strike was suspended (Law 16,936) and several other laws reversed progress made concerning labor laws throughout the preceding years. The workers' movement divided itself between Vandoristas, who supported a \\"Peronism without Peron\\" line (Vandor declared that \\"to save Perón, one has to be against Perón\\") and advocated negotiation with the junta, and Peronists, themselves divided. In July 1966 Onganía ordered the forcible clearing of five facilities of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) on July 29, 1966 by the Federal Police, an event known as La Noche de los Bastones Largos (\\"The Night of the Long Batons\\"). These facilities had been occupied by students, professors and graduates (members of the autonomous government of the university) who opposed the military government's intervention in the universities and revocation of the 1918 university reform. The university repression led to the exile of 301 university professors, including Manuel Sadosky, Tulio Halperín Donghi, Sergio Bagú and Risieri Frondizi.Marta Slemenson et al., Emigración de científicos argentinos. Organización de un éxodo a América Latina (?, Buenos Aires, 1970:118) In late May 1968 General Julio Alsogaray dissented from Onganía, and rumors spread about a possible coup d'état, with Algosaray leading the conservative opposition to Onganía. Finally, at the end of the month, Onganía dismissed the leaders of the Armed Forces: Alejandro Lanusse replaced Julio Alsogaray, Pedro Gnavi replaced Benigno Varela, and Jorge Martínez Zuviría replaced Adolfo Alvarez. On 19 September 1968, two important events affected Revolutionary Peronism. On one hand, John William Cooke, former personal delegate of Perón and ideologist of the Peronist Left, as well as a friend of Fidel Castro, died from natural causes. On the other hand, a small group (13 men and one woman) who aimed at establishing a foco in Tucumán Province, in order to head the resistance against the junta, was captured.Oscar R. Anzorena, Tiempo de violencia y utopía (1966–1976), Editorial Contrapunto, 1987, p.48 Among them was Envar El Kadre, then a leader of the Peronist Youth. In 1969 the General Confederation of Labour of the Argentines (CGTA, headed by the graphist Raimundo Ongaro) headed social movements, in particular the Cordobazo, as well as other movements in Tucumán and Santa Fe. While Perón managed a reconciliation with Augusto Vandor, head of the CGT Azopardo, he followed, in particular through the voice of his delegate Jorge Paladino, a cautious line of opposition to the military junta, criticizing with moderation the neoliberal policies of the junta but waiting for discontent inside the government (\\"hay que desencillar hasta que aclare\\", said Perón, advocating patience). Thus, Onganía had an interview with 46 CGT delegates, among them Vandor, who agreed to cooperate with the military junta, thus uniting themselves with the Nueva Corriente de Opinión headed by José Alonso and Rogelio Coria. In December 1969, more than 20 priests, members of the Movement of Priests for the Third World (MSTM), marched on the Casa Rosada to present to Onganía a petition pleading with him to abandon the planned eradication of villas miserias (shanty towns).Oscar Anzorena, 1987, p.49 Meanwhile, Onganía implemented corporatism policies, experimenting in particular in Córdoba, underneath Carlos Caballero's governance. The same year, the Movement of Priests for the Third World issued a declaration supporting socialist revolutionary movements, which led to the Catholic hierarchy, by the voice of Juan Carlos Aramburu, coadjutor archbishop of Buenos Aires, to proscribe priests from making political or social declarations.Oscar Anzorena, 1987, p.53 ==Growing instability (1969–76)== During the de facto government of the Revolución Argentina, the left began to regain power through underground movements. This was mainly through violent guerrilla groups. Later, the return of Peronism was expected to calm down the heated waters but did exactly the opposite, creating a violent breach between right-wing and left-wing Peronism, leading to years of violence and political instability that culminated with the coup d'état of 1976. ===Subversive years (1969–73)=== Various armed actions, headed by the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación (FAL), composed of former members of the Revolutionary Communist Party, occurred in April 1969, leading to several arrests among FAL members. These were the first left-wing urban guerrilla actions in Argentina. Beside these isolated actions, the Cordobazo uprising that year, called forth by the CGT de los Argentinos, and its Cordobese leader, Agustín Tosco, prompted demonstrations in the entire country. The same year, the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP) was formed as the military branch of the Trotskyist Workers' Revolutionary Party, kidnapping high-profile rich Argentines and demanding ransom. The last of the \\"de facto\\" military presidents, Alejandro Lanusse, was appointed in 1971 and attempted to re-establish democracy amidst an atmosphere of continuing Peronist workers' protests. ===Cámpora's tenure (1973)=== On March 11, 1973, Argentina held general elections for the first time in ten years. Perón was prevented from running, but voters elected his stand-in, Dr. Hector Cámpora, as President. Cámpora defeated his Radical Civic Union opponent. Cámpora won 49.5 percent of the votes in the presidential election following a campaign based on a platform of national reconstruction.Miguel Bonasso, El Presidente que no fue. Los archivos occultos del peronismo (\\"The President who wasn't; the hidden archives of Peronism\\"), Planeta, Buenos Aires, 1997. Riding a wave of mass support, Cámpora inaugurated his period on May 25. He acceded to his functions on May 25, which was saluted by a massive popular gathering of the Peronist Youth movement, Montoneros, FAR and FAP (\\"Fuerzas Armadas Peronistas\\") in the Plaza de Mayo. Cámpora assumed a strong stance against right-wing Peronists, declaring during his first speech: \\"La sangre derramada no será negociada\\" (\\"Spilled blood will not be negotiated\\"). Cuban president Osvaldo Dorticós and Chilean president Salvador Allende were present at his inauguration, while William P. Rogers, U.S. Secretary of State, and Uruguayan president Juan Bordaberry, could not attend, blocked in their respective cars by demonstrators. Political prisoners were liberated on the same day, under the pressure of the demonstrators. Cámpora's government included progressive figures such as Interior Minister Esteban Righi and Education Minister Jorge Taiana, but also included members of the labor and political right-wing Peronist factions, such as José López Rega, Perón's personal secretary and Minister of Social Welfare, and a member of the P2 Masonic lodge. Perón's followers also commanded strong majorities in both houses of Congress. Hector Cámpora's government followed a traditional Peronist economic policy, supporting the national market and redistributing wealth. One of José Ber Gelbard's first measures as minister of economics was to augment workers' wages. However, the 1973 oil crisis seriously affected Argentina's oil- dependent economy. Almost 600 social conflicts, strikes or occupations occurred in Cámpora's first month. The military conceded Campora's victory, but strikes, as well as government-backed violence, continued unabated. The slogan \\"Campora in government, Perón in power\\" expressed the real source of popular joy, however. ===Return of Perón (1973–74)=== Amidst escalating terror from the right and left alike, Perón decided to return and assume the presidency. On June 20, 1973, two million people waited for him at Ezeiza airport. From Perón's speaking platform, camouflaged far-right gunmen fired on the masses, shooting at the Peronist Youth movement and the Montoneros, killing at least thirteen and injuring more than three hundred (this became known as the Ezeiza massacre).Horacio Verbitsky, \\"Ezeiza\\", Contrapunto, Buenos Aires, 1985. Cámpora and vice-president Solano Lima resigned on July 13. Deputy Raúl Alberto Lastiri, José López Rega's son-in-law and also a P2 member, was then promoted to the presidency to organize elections. Cámpora's followers such as Chancellor Juan Carlos Puig and Interior Minister Esteban Righi were immediately replaced by Alberto J. Vignes and Benito Llambi, and the Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo (ERP - People's Revolutionary Army) was declared a \\"dissolved terrorist organization\\". On September 23, Perón won the elections with 61.85% of the votes, with his third wife, Isabel Martínez de Perón, as vice-president. Their administration was inaugurated on October 12. Peronist right-wing factions won a decisive victory and Perón assumed the Presidency in October 1973, a month after Pinochet's coup in Chile. Violent acts, including by the Triple A, continued to threaten public order. On September 25, 1973, José Ignacio Rucci, CGT trade-union's Secretary General and Perón's friend, was assassinated by the Montoneros. The government resorted to a number of emergency decrees, including the implementation of special executive authority to deal with violence. This allowed the government to imprison individuals indefinitely without charge. In his second period in office, Perón was committed to achieving political peace through a new alliance of business and labor to promote national reconstruction. Peron's charisma and his past record with respect to labor helped him maintain his working-class support.de, Lima-Dantas Elizabeth ===Isabel's government (1974–76)=== Perón died on July 1, 1974. His wife succeeded him in office, but her administration was undermined by the economic collapse (inflation was skyrocketing and GDP contracted), Peronist intra-party struggles, and growing acts of terrorism by insurgents such as the ERP and paramilitary movements. Isabel de Perón was inexperienced in politics and only carried Perón's name; Lopez Rega was described as a man with numerous occult interests, including astrology, and a supporter of dissident Catholic groups. Economic policies were directed at restructuring wages and currency devaluations in order to attract foreign investment capital to Argentina. López Rega was ousted as Isabel de Perón's adviser in June 1975; General Numa Laplane, the commander in chief of the army who had supported the administration through the Lopez Rega period, was replaced by General Jorge Rafael Videla in August 1975. Montoneros, led by Mario Firmenich, cautiously decided to go underground after Peron's death. Isabel Perón was removed from office by the military coup on March 24, 1976. This gave way to the last and arguably most violent de facto government in Argentina, the National Reorganization Process. ==National Reorganization Process (1976–83)== Argentine junta leader Jorge Rafael Videla meeting U.S. President Jimmy Carter in September 1977 Following the coup against Isabel Perón, the armed forces formally exercised power through a junta led consecutively by Videla, Viola, Galtieri and Bignone until December 10, 1983. These de facto dictators termed their government program the \\"National Reorganization Process\\"; and \\"Dirty War\\" () is the name used by the military junta or civic-military dictatorship of Argentina () for this period of state terrorism in Argentina as part of Operation Condor. from 1974, during which military and security forces and right-wing death squads in the form of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A)Right-wing violence was also on the rise, and an array of death squads was formed from armed sections of the large labor unions, parapolice organizations within the federal and provincial police; and the AAA (Alianza Anticomunista Argentina), founded by Perón's secretary of social welfare, López Rega, with the participation of the federal police. Revolutionizing Motherhood: The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, Marguerite Guzman Bouvard, p. 22, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2002 hunted down any kind of (or suspected to be) political dissidents and anyone believed to be associated with socialism or contrary to the plan of neoliberal economic policies dictated by Operation Condor.Political Violence and Trauma in Argentina, Antonius C. G. M. Robben, p. 145, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007Marguerite Guzmán Bouvard, Revolutionizing Motherhood: The Mothers of the Plaza De Mayo, p. 22, Rowman & Littlefield, 1994 About 30,000 people disappeared, many of whom could not be formally reported as missing due to the nature of state terrorism. The targets were students, militants, trade unionists, writers, journalists, artists and anyone suspected to be a left- wing activist, included Peronist guerrillas. The \\"disappeared\\" (victims kidnapped, tortured and murdered whose bodies were disappeared by the military government) included those thought to be politically or ideologically a threat to the military junta, even vaguely; and they were killed in an attempt by the junta to silence the social and political opposition. Monument to the Falklands War fallen, Rosario Serious economic problems, mounting charges of corruption, public discontent and, finally, the country's 1982 defeat by the United Kingdom in the Falklands War following Argentina's unsuccessful attempt to seize the Falkland Islands all combined to discredit the Argentine military regime. Under strong public pressure, the junta lifted bans on political parties and gradually restored basic political liberties. Most of the members of the Junta are currently in prison for crimes against humanity and genocide. ===Beagle conflict=== The Beagle conflict began to brew in the 1960s, when Argentina began to claim that the Picton, Lennox and Nueva islands in the Beagle Channel were rightfully hers. In 1971, Chile and Argentina signed an agreement formally submitting the Beagle Channel issue to binding Beagle Channel Arbitration. On May 2, 1977 the court ruled that the islands and all adjacent formations belonged to Chile. See the Report and decision of the Court of Arbitration. On 25 January 1978, the Argentina military junta led by General Jorge Videla declared the award fundamentally null and intensified their claim over the islands. On 22 December 1978, Argentina startedSee Argentine newspaper Clarín of Buenos Aires, 20 December 1998 Operation Soberanía over the disputed islands, but the invasion was halted due to: : (The newspaper Clarín explained some years later that such caution was based,) in part, on military concerns. In order to achieve a victory, certain objectives had to be reached before the seventh day after the attack. Some military leaders considered this not enough time due to the difficulty involved in transportation through the passes over the Andean Mountains.See Alejandro Luis Corbacho \\"Predicting the probability of war during brinkmanship crisis: The Beagle and the Malvinas conflicts\\" https://ssrn.com/abstract=1016843 (p.45) and in cite 46: : According to Clarín, two consequences were feared. First, those who were dubious feared a possible regionalization of the conflict. Second, as a consequence, the conflict could acquire great power proportions. In the first case decision makers speculated that Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Brazil might intervene. Then the great powers could take sides. In this case, the resolution of the conflict would depend not on the combatants, but on the countries that supplied the weapons. In December that year, moments before Videla signed a declaration of war against Chile, Pope John Paul II agreed to mediate between the two nations. The Pope's envoy, Cardinal Antonio Samorè, successfully averted war and proposed a new definitive boundary in which the three disputed islands would remain Chilean. Argentina and Chile both agreed to Samoré's proposal and signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina, ending that dispute. ==New democracy (1983–present)== Raúl Alfonsín's Presidential assignment, 1983. On October 30, 1983, Argentines went to the polls to choose a president; vice-president; and national, provincial, and local officials in elections found by international observers to be fair and honest. The country returned to constitutional rule after Raúl Alfonsín, candidate of the Radical Civic Union (Unión Cívica Radical, UCR), received 52% of the popular vote for president. He began a 6-year term of office on December 10, 1983. ===Alfonsín era (1983–1989)=== Five days later, he created the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP), led by Argentine writer Ernesto Sabato. However, it was also under Alfonsín's presidency that the December 24, 1986 \\"Full stop law\\" was voted, granting amnesty to all acts committed before December 10, 1983, amid pressure from the military. It would not be until June 2005's Supreme Court decision to overturn all amnesty laws that investigations could be started again. During the Alfonsín administration, a Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina with Chile was signed and the roots of the Mercosur trade bloc were established. In 1985 and 1987, large turnouts for mid-term elections demonstrated continued public support for a strong and vigorous democratic system. The UCR-led government took steps to resolve some of the nation's most pressing problems, including accounting for those who disappeared during military rule, establishing civilian control of the armed forces, and consolidating democratic institutions. One of the biggest achievements of the Alfonsín administration was the reduction of corruption in public offices, which was reduced by half during his administration. However, constant friction with the military, failure to resolve several economic problems inherited from the military dictatorship and great opposition from the labor unions undermined the effectiveness of the Alfonsín government, which left office six months early after Peronist candidate Carlos Menem won the 1989 presidential elections. ===Menemist decade (1989–99)=== Carlos Menem, President throughout the 1990s As President, Carlos Menem launched a major overhaul of Argentine domestic policy. Large-scale structural reforms dramatically reversed the role of the state in Argentine economic life. Ironically, the Peronist Menem oversaw the privatization of many of the industries Perón had nationalized. A decisive leader pressing a controversial agenda, Menem was not reluctant to use the presidency's powers to issue \\"emergency\\" decrees (formally Necessity and Urgency Decrees) when the Congress was unable to reach consensus on his proposed reforms. Those powers were curtailed somewhat when the constitution was reformed in 1994 as a result of the so-called Pact of Olivos with the opposition Radical Party. That arrangement opened the way for Menem to seek and win reelection with 50% of the vote in the three-way 1995 presidential race. Piquetero movement rose. The 1995 election saw the emergence of the moderate-left FrePaSo political alliance. This alternative to the two traditional political parties in Argentina was particularly strong in Buenos Aires but lacked the national infrastructure of the Peronists and Radicals. In an important development in Argentina's political life, all three major parties in the 1999 race espoused free market economic policies. ===New millennium crisis (1999–2003)=== De La Rúa presidency (1999–2001) In October 1999, the UCR-FrePaSo Alianza's presidential candidate, Fernando de la Rúa, defeated Peronist candidate Eduardo Duhalde. Having taken office in December 1999, De la Rúa followed an IMF-sponsored program of government spending cuts, revenue increases, and provincial revenue-sharing reforms to get the federal fiscal deficit under control, and pursued labor market flexibilization and business-promotion measures aimed at stimulating foreign investment, so as to avoid defaulting the public debt. Towards the end of 2001, Argentina faced grave economic problems. The IMF pressed Argentina to service its external debt, effectively forcing Argentina to devalue the Argentine peso, which had been pegged to the U.S. dollar, or alternatively fully dollarize its economy. Deep budget cuts, including a 13% reduction in pay for the nation's 2 million public sector employees, failed to curb the rapidly increasing country risk on almost U$100 billion in Argentine bonds, increasing debt service costs and further limiting access to international credit, despite a moderately successful debt swap arranged by Minister Cavallo with most bondholders. Voters reacted to the rapidly worsening economy in the October 2001 midterm elections by both depriving the Alliance of its majority in the Lower House, and by casting a record 25% of spoiled ballots. Corralito (2001) Police intervention in the 2001 riots On November 1, 2001, as people's fears that the peso would be devalued caused massive withdrawal of bank deposits and capital flight, de la Rúa's Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo passed regulations severely limiting withdrawals, effectively freezing the peso-denominated assets of the Argentine middle class, while dollar-denominated foreign accounts were, by its very nature, shielded from devaluation. (The freezing of the bank accounts was informally named corralito.) The overall economy declined drastically during December 2001. The resulting riots led to dozens of deaths. The Minister of Economy Domingo Cavallo resigned, but that did not prevent the collapse of De la Rúa's administration. On December 20 de la Rúa also resigned, but the political crisis was extremely serious, as a result of the previous resignation of the vice-president Carlos \\"Chacho\\" Álvarez in 2000. The president of the Senate became interim president until the National Congress elected, two days later, Adolfo Rodríguez Saá to finish De la Rúa's term. But Rodríguez Saá resigned a week later on December 31, leaving the power to the president of the Chamber of Deputies (as the Senate was undergoing their annual renovation of its president) as interim. Finally, on January 2, 2002, the National Congress elected the Peronist Eduardo Duhalde, a losing candidate in the most recent presidential election, as. president. The peso was first devalued by 29%, and then the dollar peg was abandoned; by July 2002, the national currency had depreciated to one-quarter of its former value. Recovery (2002–03) President Duhalde faced a country in turmoil. His administration had to deal with a wave of protests (middle-class cacerolazos and unemployed piqueteros), and did so with a relatively tolerant policy, intending to minimize violence. As inflation became a serious issue and the effects of the crisis became apparent in the form of increased unemployment and poverty, Duhalde chose a moderate, low-profile economist, Roberto Lavagna, as his Minister of Economy. The economic measures implemented brought inflation under control. After a year, Duhalde deemed his tasks fulfilled and, pressured by certain political factors, called for elections, which in April 2003 brought Néstor Kirchner, the center left Peronist governor of Santa Cruz, to power. ===Kirchner governments (2003–2015)=== President Néstor Kirchner took office on May 25, 2003. He reshuffled the leadership of the Armed Forces, overturned controversial amnesty laws that protected members of the 1976-1983 dictatorship from prosecution, and kept Lavagna on as economy minister for most of his presidency. Kirchner's administration saw a strong economic rebound, and foreign debt restructuring. The Guardian compares Kirchner's economic policy with that of Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression. For the British daily, the Argentine president managed to take over a failed economy (21% unemployment, half the population below the poverty line and a 20% decline in GDP) by rejecting IMF injunctions. An economic policy that has allowed Argentina to advance on average growth of 8% per year and to lift 11 million people out of poverty.Néstor Kirchner: Argentina's independence hero Mark Weisbrot, 27 October 2010. theguardian.com In 28 October 2007, the 2007 general election took place in ten provinces and Fernández de Kirchner's Front for Victory won in six provinces. Hermes Binner was elected Governor of Santa Fe, becoming the first Socialist governor in Argentina's history and the first non-Peronist to rule the rather wealthy Santa Fe province, and center-left Fabiana Ríos of ARI, became the first woman to be elected governor of Tierra del Fuego, while the center-right Mauricio Macri was elected Chief of Government of Buenos Aires City in June 2007.Pour la première fois, un socialiste est élu gouverneur d'une province argentine, Le Monde, 4 September 2007 On December 10, 2007, then-First Lady and Senator Cristina Fernández de Kirchner took over the presidency from her husband, after winning elections with 44% of the vote. Her husband remained a highly influential politician during her term. The press developed the term \\"presidential marriage\\" to make reference to both of them at once.Mendelevich, p. 279 Some political analysts compared this type of government with a diarchy.Mendelevich, p. 280 After proposing a new taxation system for agricultural exports Fernández de Kirchner's government had to face a severe lock out of the sector. The protest, which spread over 129 days, was quickly politicized and marked an inflection point in her administration. The system was finally rejected in the Senate by an opposing vote by the Vice President Julio Cobos. The political style of the government changed in 2010 with the death of Néstor Kirchner. President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner slowly distanced herself from the traditional structure of the Justicialist Party and favored instead La Cámpora, a group of young supporters led by her eldest son Máximo Kirchner. In the elections of 2011, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner of the Front for Victory won via landslide by 54.11% of votes against Hermes Binner. Winning in the City of Buenos Aires and every province except San Luis (won by Federal Commitment candidate Alberto Rodríguez Saá), she became the first candidate to obtain an absolute majority of the popular vote since Raúl Alfonsín in 1983, and upon completion of ballot processing, the margin of victory (37.1%) exceeded Juan Perón's record 36% margin obtained in 1973. Fernández de Kirchner became the first woman re-elected as head of state in Latin American history. === Macri Administration (2015-2019)=== Mauricio Macri served as President of Argentina from 2015 to 2019. On 22 November 2015, Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri won the presidency via ballotage, succeeding Cristina Fernández de Kirchner as President. As leader of the Republican Proposal (PRO) party, he won the presidency with an alliance known as Cambiemos (Let's Change), also integrated by the Civic Coalition ARI and the Radical Civic Union.

She wears a deep purple tunic, held at the waist by her \\"ExtraOrdinary Wizard\\" belt and a purple cloak which is part of her Magyk. Around her neck is the \\"Akhu Amulet of Hotep-Ra\\", the source of power for \\"ExtraOrdinary Wizards\\". Marcia also wears a pair of pointy purple python skin boots made for her by shoemaker Terry Tarsal. Terry very much dislikes snakes, and swears Marcia orders snakeskin on purpose. which may or may not be true. She has an aura of Magyk around her. Marcia can be fascinating and bossy, and scary to those around her. She is ambitious. == Development == The Marcia character was key in Sage's development and continuation of the Heap series, as she motivates a lot of Septimus's decisions.About the Author.

DoodledBooks.com Accessed 30 December 2008.New wizard books to become films.BBC Accessed 30 December 2008. == Plot  Marcia becomes the \\"ExtraOrdinary Wizard\\" === Marcia always wanted to be an \\"ExtraOrdinary Wizard\\". She made sure she apprenticed to Alther Mella, the \\"ExtraOrdinary Wizard\\" of her day. Alther was a patient teacher and a good wizard. After Marcia completed her final wizard examination, the heir to the Castle was born. Marcia and Alther went to the Palace to congratulate the Queen. However, the Queen and Alther were both murdered by an assassin. Before dying, Alther gave Marcia the \\"Akhu Amulet\\" making Marcia the \\"ExtraOrdinary Wizard\\". Marcia was able to protect the new baby princess and gave her to a Wizard, Silas Heap for hiding. He raised her as his own daughter, Jenna. === Progress === When Jenna is 10, Marcia takes her away with the assistance of Silas, his son Nicko and a \\"Young Army\\" boy called 'Boy 412'. Marcia does a Projection while escaping to Marram Marshes to fend off the Hunters. At Zelda's cottage, Marcia learns that the Necromancer, DomDaniel, has taken over the Wizard Tower. She wants to take revenge but Alther's ghost warns her not to. While teaching the children about Magyk, she learns that Boy 412 has immense Magykal powers. Marcia asks him to be her apprentice, but Boy 412 refuses. One day, Marcia receives a message from Silas and goes back to the Castle, but it is a trap and she is caught by DomDaniel's guards. DomDaniel throws her in \\"Dungeon Number One' and takes away her amulet, which drains all her powers. Boy 412, assisted by Jenna and Nicko, board DomDaniel's ship and a fight ensues which results in Marcia taking back her amulet and escaping on the Dragon Boat. Boy 412 accepts the offer of apprenticeship, and Marcia comes to know that he is the real Septimus Heap. Marcia returns to the Wizard Tower in Flyte. She rids the Tower of the Darkenesse left by DomDaniel, but cannot rid it of a shadow that trails her. Marcia builds a Shadow Safe, but DomDaniel's bones have been placed within. They later reassemble and try to kill Marcia, but she identified them for who they used to be and prevails. In Physik, Marcia comes to learn that Septimus has been sent back in time by getting pulled through a magykal looking glass in the Queen's Room by Marcellus Pye. In the meantime, an evil Queen Etheldredda's spirit (who sent Septimus back) gets released by Silas Heap when he unseals her portrait and wreaks havoc on the Castle. Marcia does all she can to retrieve Septimus and stop a sicknesse from spreading, but nothing seems to work. Jenna, Nicko and Snorri go back in time and retrieve Septimus, but sadly Nicko and Snorri get trapped in that time. When Septimus gets back he and Marcia create an antidote for the sicknesse by using what he learned from Marcellus. Marcia, on learning Etheldredda's evil plan to kill Jenna so she can be queen forever, decides to destroy her. She makes a huge BoneFyre out of Septimus' pet dragon Spit Fyre's fire and through strong magic, pulls Etheldredda's spirit to the fire and destroys her forever. She is also able to destroy Etheldredda's pet called Aie-Aie who was responsible for the sicknesse. In order to control Septimus' moves, Marcia takes away his Flyte Charm and locks it. Tertius Fume, an ancient evil ghost, calls for the legendary drawing of the Queste stone. Marcia prevents this by helping Septimus escape, assisted by Jenna and his friend Beetle, who discovers that going to the House of Foryx will enable them to find Nicko and Snorri. He also realizes that going there is actually the Queste. Marcia tries to find him through her magic and even enlists Simon's help through his tracker ball, Sleuth. But all hope seems failing when Septimus communicates to her his whereabouts by writing on a twin of Marcia's door. She takes Sarah Heap and goes on Septimus' dragon to the House of Foryx, where she bangs on the door, ignoring the door bell, and immediately Septimus - followed by the others - come out and all are able to return to their own time. In Syren Marcia promotes Septimus to Senior Apprentice, because he was the first to complete and come back alive from his Queste. Septimus immediately jumps at the chance to take leave meet up with Jenna, Nicko, and Snorri (who stayed behind across the sea with Milo Banda), and Marcia reluctantly lets him do so. At the end when Tertius Fume attempts to murder Marcia with an army of warrior jinnee stolen from Milo. With several swords at Marcia's throat, Septimus and his own jinnee - Jim Knee - race to freeze the whole army, and save her. And they do. == Character Magical power=== Marcia is an extremely powerful wizard. She can perform any kind of magyk. She is able to create a fog as well as a projection at the same time, which even Silas (who generally doesn't approve of Marcia) admires. She is even adept at little Physik, as when she cures Septimus' spider bite with a little dark magic in Flyte. She can transport freely from one place to another like she did in Magyk or Queste. She is adept at day to day needy magyks like cleaning and transfiguration. She modifies Zelda's desk by adding hands to it in Magyk or cleaning up the scribes mess in a trifle in Queste. She knows how to dispel darke unruly magic like a placement and escapes from it in Flyte. She is knowledgeable in disabling magyk such as restrain, silence and freeze. ===Other traits, possessions and likes === Marcia is generally short tempered and impatient. Marcia cannot keep patience with Sarah or Septimus' pet Spit Fyre, Silas' pet wolfhound Maxie or the manuscriptorium chief scribe Jillie Djinn. Her temper scares people the most about her, though Marcia does not believe that she is scary as is evident in Magyk. At the same time she is ambitious and knowledgeable. She loves Septimus and Jenna and shows them her soft side. Although it seems that she and Silas are constantly bickering, they respect each other. She is on good terms with the ghost of her mentor Alther and still seeks his knowledge and help. She hates Aunt Zelda's cabbage sandwiches. In Queste she decides to be patient with Marcellus Pye although she disapproves of him, as he could have helped her find Septimus. Among Marcia's dearest possessions are her purple python skin boots which she has stockpiled after her favorite ones were ruined in events from Magyk.Marcia's distinguishing feature Retrieved on 2008-12-30 ==Reception== The character received widespread critical acclaim.

His grandparents had performed professionally in concerts and summer entertainments in the beach towns of southern England, at which Charlie Chaplin had once performed as a guest artist. He had four talented siblings: one brother played bassoon and saxophone; another became an actor; a sister was a pianist and she and Leonard often played together; and another sister was an actress. He first handled a violin at age 4. At age 14 he won the 1942 Queensland Eisteddfod Championship in violin playing. He was offered a scholarship to Trinity College at the London School of Music, but World War II prevented him accepting it. Instead, he went to the Conservatorium of Music at the University of Melbourne, where the pianist Max Cooke became one of his closest friends. In 1949, Marie Rambert brought her ballet to Australia, and she appointed Dommett as a solo violinist. He passed his first test, accompanying a ballet set to Ernest Chausson's Poème. Rambert was so impressed that she made him her concert master, and later her conductor. He moved with the company to New Zealand and then to London. There he played with the London Symphony, London Philharmonic and Royal Philharmonic orchestras. He became assistant conductor at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. He returned to Australia in 1953 and played with the Queensland and Sydney symphony orchestras. In 1961 he became leader and later deputy conductor of the South Australian Symphony Orchestra. In 1965 he became concertmaster of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (MSO), and later assistant conductor. He intermittently played with the London orchestras, but for the most part he remained in Melbourne till 1980. At a concert in Munich, he received a standing ovation after playing the Violin Concerto by Felix Werder; a performance by him of this piece, with the MSO, was released in 1971 on an LP from the now-defunct Festival label. After he left the MSO he taught at the Canberra School of Music for the next two decades. Later he was music master and conductor at St Margaret's Girls School in Brisbane, where they performed Vivaldi's The Four Seasons and Fauré's Requiem, among several other works, under his direction. Eight composers wrote violin concertos specifically for Dommett. He did a great deal of recording, including 56 concertos, and a disc of Mozart violin sonatas with Max Cooke. In addition, he conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra in the premiere recording of Malcolm Williamson's Piano Concerto No. 3, with the composer as soloist. He played a 1727 Peter Guarneri violin, which was offered for sale in 2008.Milovanovic, Selma (18 November 2008). \\"Prized violin on sale with hope it will stay in Australia\\", The Age, p. 5.

The rank is derived from the German rank Feldwebel and was used as a rank in the Landsknecht (15th and 16th century) for the one who was responsible for aligning troops during battle. Vääpelis were trained at the Maanpuolustusopisto, a military junior college, and were usually salaried staff NCOs, as opposed to conscripts or officers. == Yksikön vääpeli == Vääpeli may also refer to a position - rather than a rank - of yksikön vääpeli (vääpeli of the unit), commonly komppanian vääpeli or patterin vääpeli (vääpeli of the company, vääpeli of the battery), which is a position similar to First Sergeant in the US Armed Forces or company sergeant major of the British and Commonwealth Armed Forces with the exception that in the Finnish Defence Force this position may be held by either a commissioned or a non- commissioned officer while in the US, UK and Commonwealth militaries the equivalent position is always held by an NCO. In the chain of command of a company (or an artillery battery) the yksikön vääpeli is second only to the company commander and therefore may be in command of technically higher- ranking officers. Usually the position is held by a lieutenant or an yliluutnantti (senior lieutenant), but it is not unheard of for it to be held by a sergeant. The tern yksikköupseeri (officer of the unit), although officially discontinued since July 2009, may regardless unofficially be used of the position. In the artillery, the equivalent was patteriupseeri (officer of the battery) which continues to be unofficially used in a similar fashion. == See also == * Finnish military ranks == References == Category:Military ranks of Finland Category:Military insignia Category:Military ranks of Sweden fi:Sotilasarvot Suomen puolustusvoimissa sv:Lista över finländska militära grader ","title":"Vääpeli"},{"id":"19284103","text":"F66 or F.66 may refer to : * Farman F.66, a French Farman aircraft and also : * the ICD-10 code for psychological and behavioural disorders associated with sexual development and orientation ","title":"F66"},{"id":"19284126","text":"The Haircut (date unknown) Lovesick (date unknown) Vicente Palmaroli González (5 September 1834 - 25 January 1896) was a Spanish portrait and genre painter. == Biography == He was born in Zarzalejo, the son of Gaetano Palmaroli, an Italian painter and lithographer, who was his first teacher.

The following year, he returned to Italy and remained until 1866.Vicente Palimiroli @ MCN Biografías After his return to the Court, he won a Gold Medal at the National Exhibition of 1867. That same year, he accompanied the Spanish delegation to the Exposition Universelle in Paris. While there, he met Ernest Meissonier, who would have an influence on his later work. Over the next few years, he would become a renowned portrait painter. In 1872, he was named a Professor at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando.Brief Biography @ the Museo del Prado website A year later, he settled in Paris and specialized in creating \\"tableautins\\"; small format paintings on amusing or pleasant themes designed to be hung in the home. In 1883, he moved to Rome to become Director of the . He returned to Madrid in 1894 when he was appointed Director of the Museo del Prado, a position he would hold until his death. Following a Royal directive, he set up a commission (consisting of himself, the Secretary and the museum's curators) to examine donated works and decide whether to accept or reject them, pursuant to maintaining the quality of the collection. He also oversaw maintenance, which included replacing the wooden roofs with metallic ones. A planned heating system was cancelled due to lack of funds. To help prevent fires, the employee's living quarters were moved to a new extension, built under the direction of architect Fernando Arbós y Tremanti. Most of the works added to the Prado during his tenure were later moved to the collection at the new Museo de Arte Moderno. He suffered a stroke while attending a theatrical performance, became an invalid, and died several months later in Madrid, aged 61. ==See also== * List of Orientalist artists * Orientalism == References  Further reading == * Rosa Pérez Morandeira, Vicente Palmiroli, Editorial CSIC 1971. * Diccionario de Arte, Pintores del siglo XIX, Editorial LIBSA, 2001. . == External links == * ArtNet: More works by Palmiroli * Galería Pintores Españoles: Vicente Palmiroli @ Foro Xerbar Category:1834 births Category:1896 deaths Category:19th-century Spanish painters Category:Spanish male painters Category:Directors of the Museo del Prado Category:Madrilenian people Category:Orientalist painters Category:Spanish people of Italian descent ","title":"Vicente Palmaroli"},{"id":"19284131","text":"F68 or F.68 may refer to : * Farman F.68, a French Farman aircraft and also : * the ICD-10 code for other disorders of adult personality and behaviour ","title":"F68"},{"id":"19284171","text":"Celery asazuke (literally: shallow pickling) is a Japanese pickling method characterized by its short preparation time. The word asazuke can also refer to the items pickled in this manner. Because of its short preparation time, asazuke generally lacks the pungency created by other, more lengthy pickling methods but retains more of the fresh taste of the vegetable. Commonly used vegetables include daikon, hakusai, cucumbers, or eggplant. Asazuke is usually prepared by rubbing the cut vegetables with salt and placing in a sealed bag or other sealed container along with such items as sliced kombu or chili peppers. Instead of salt, asazuke can also be prepared with vinegar, nuka, or a pickling solution that is sold in stores. Sufficient pickling times range anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours. Asazuke has become a very popular method of pickling in Japanese households due to its ease of preparation. ==ReferencesSee also== * Category:Japanese cuisine Category:Japanese pickles ","title":"Asazuke"},{"id":"19284205","text":"William Wintershall (died July 1679), also Wintersall or Wintersell, was a noted seventeenth-century English actor.Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Others Associated with the Representation of Plays in England Before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; pp. 398-99. His career spanned the difficult years of mid-century, when English theatres were closed from 1642 to 1660, during the English Civil War and the Interregnum. According to James Wright's Historia Histrionica (1699), Wintershall's career began in the final years of the period of English Renaissance theatre; he was likely a young member of Queen Henrietta's Men at the Salisbury Court Theatre in the 1637-42 years. During the theatre closure, 1642-60, Wintershall was one of the English actors who performed in Europe, mainly in The Hague and Paris, in the middle 1640s.Judith Milhous and Robert D. Hume, \\"New Light on English Acting Companies in 1646, 1648, and 1660,\\" Review of English Studies, New Series, Vol. 42 No. 168 (November 1991), pp. 487-509; see p. 490. Wintershall became involved in a lawsuit with fellow actor Andrew Cane in 1654. The suit involved a thirty-year-old debt of £40, between Richard Gunnell, builder of the Salisbury Court Theatre, and his actors, including Cane; Wintershall had married Gunnell's daughter Margaret in 1641 or 1642, so becoming involved in the dispute. (The outcome of the suit is not known).Leslie Hotson, The Commonwealth and Restoration Stage, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1928; pp. 52-3. In 1659 Wintershall and a Henry Eaton paid a bond for a court appearance by Anthony Turner, who was in legal trouble for violating the prohibition against acting. (If Wintershall had been in Queen Henrietta's Men, Turner was a former colleague.) Wintershall's stage career experienced a resurgence with the Restoration; he was one of the thirteen actors who were the original \\"sharers\\" (partners) in the King's Company under the management of Thomas Killigrew. Wintershall played a wide range of roles with the troupe, including: * King Henry in Shakespeare's Henry IV plays * Master Slender in The Merry Wives of Windsor * Octavius Caesar in Julius Caesar * Cokes in Jonson's Bartholomew Fair * Subtle in The Alchemist * Sir Amorous La Foole in Epicene * the King in Fletcher's The Humorous Lieutenant * Gobrias in Beaumont and Fletcher's A King and No King * the King in The Maid's Tragedy * Sir Gervase Simple in Shirley's Love in a Maze * Don Alonzo in Dryden's An Evening's Love * Arimant in Aureng-zebe * Polydamas in Marriage à la mode * Odmar in The Indian Emperour * Bomilcar in Lee's Sophonisba, or Hannibal's Overthrow * King John of France in Boyle's The Black Prince. The notes to Buckingham's play The Rehearsal (1671; printed 1672) describe Wintershall as \\"a most judicious actor, and the best instructor of others.\\" John Downes, in his Roscius Anglicanus (1708), called Wintershall \\"good in Tragedy, as well as in Comedy....\\" ==References== Category:17th-century English male actors Category:English male stage actors Category:1679 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"William Wintershall"},{"id":"19284214","text":"The Hāwea Conservation Park is a protected area in the South Island of New Zealand.

He began his career as a quantitative equity trader at Bear Stearns and later worked at Kidder, Peabody & Co. Fletcher, who is African American, sued Kidder Peabody for racial discrimination. Although his racial discrimination claims were dismissed, he eventually won an arbitration award of US$1.26 million. Fletcher has also been involved in litigation centered on a dispute with the board of The Dakota apartment building in New York City. Fletcher founded Fletcher Asset Management in 1991. His main fund, Fletcher International, may have been insolvent since 2008 and was declared bankrupt in 2012. ==Early life and education== Fletcher was raised in Waterford, Connecticut. His father, Alphonse, Sr., was a technician at the Electric Boat Corporation in Groton, a company that makes submarines. His mother, Bettye, a long-time teacher and later a social worker, dean, and school principal, received a PhD in Education from Teachers College, Columbia University. Fletcher has two younger brothers, Todd, and Geoffrey, a screenwriter, film director and Academy Award winner. He attended Harvard College, where he received an A.B. degree as an applied mathematics major in 1987. He was elected first marshall of the 1987 class. He earned a Master's degree in Environmental Management from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies in 2004. ==Career== After graduating from Harvard College in 1987, Fletcher began his career at Bear Stearns as a quantitative equity trader who capitalized on dividend-related arbitrage. He was recruited to Kidder Peabody as a trader in the equity trading group. ===Fletcher Asset Management=== After his tenure at Kidder Peabody, he founded Fletcher Asset Management, which makes private investments in small- capitalization public companies. During Fletcher Asset Management's first four years, it traded with heavy leverage. His general strategy was trading public instruments for his own account and on behalf of clients, but he also made longer-term equity investments. He used hedges with both types of investments. He has also been involved in PIPE deals. At one time, his firm's trading activity occasionally accounted for 5% of the volume on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1994, Fletcher surrendered his broker-dealer registration and became a registered investment adviser, which made managing money more convenient. ===Fund bankruptcy=== In July 2011, FIA Leveraged Fund, an investment vehicle managed by Fletcher Asset Management, was unable to meet a redemption request, totaling $144 million, by three Louisiana pension fund investors. In April 2012, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands ruled that the fund was insolvent and ordered that it be wound up (liquidated). In June 2012, Fletcher International Ltd., the Bermuda-based \\"master fund\\" for the Fletcher funds, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Manhattan.Pension Funds Sue on a Deal Gone Cold February 24, 2014 Deal B%k by Rachel Abrams New York Times ==LitigationAlphonse Fletcher vs. Kidder Peabody=== In 1991, after working as an equity trader at Kidder Peabody, Fletcher filed a lawsuit in New York state court for employment racial discrimination. The New York Court of Appeals ruled that Fletcher's claim must be arbitrated. In a NYSE arbitration, Fletcher was awarded $1.26 million, and in a subsequent arbitration, the racial discrimination claim was dismissed. ===Dakota lawsuit=== In February 2011, Fletcher filed a lawsuit against the Board of Directors of The Dakota co-op building in Manhattan, where he had lived since 1992 and owned four apartments. Among other things, he alleged defamation and unlawful discrimination. In March 2010, Fletcher had signed a contract to purchase a fifth apartment at The Dakota, intending to combine it with his current home. The Dakota's board said that it rejected Fletcher's application based on the financial materials he provided in his application. Judge Eileen A. Rakower granted The Dakota's motion for summary judgment and dismissed the suit in September 2015. Fletcher announced his intention to appeal. ===Federal Tax Lien=== On May 29, 2013 the Wall Street Journal reported that the Internal Revenue Service had filed a $1.4 million income-tax lien against Alphonse \\"Buddy\\" Fletcher Jr. ==Fletcher Foundation and philanthropy== In 1993, following the death of friend and advisor Reginald Lewis, Fletcher donated $1 million to the Reginald F. Lewis Memorial Endowment. The endowment had been created by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People after Lewis instructed his wife to bequeath $2 million to the organization. In 1996, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Plessy v. Ferguson, , Fletcher endowed a University professorship at Harvard College. In 2004, Fletcher created the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor Fellowship program to financially support professors working to improve race relations at Harvard. Funded as part of the Fletcher Foundation, Henry Louis Gates Jr. is the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor at Harvard. ==Personal life== In 2007, Fletcher married Ellen Pao, then a junior partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. Fletcher and Pao met while Aspen Institute fellows. They have a daughter together. Prior to his marriage to Pao, Fletcher was in a relationship with Hobart V. \\"Bo\\" Fowlkes Jr. for more than 10 years. Fletcher and his wife have lived in the St. Regis Residence in San Francisco.

The UN Command campaign to repel the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)'s armed attack against the Republic of Korea (ROK) did not result in a concluded peace, but an interim Armistice Agreement meant to establish the conditions necessary for achieving lasting peace through diplomatic means. The parties to conflict established the Military Armistice Commission (MAC) to manage implementation of the terms of Armistice, to investigate alleged violations, to serve as an intermediary between the commanders of the opposing sides, and to settle through negotiation any violations of the Armistice Agreement. The MAC is a combined organization consisting of ten senior military officers: five through UNC Commander appointment and five appointed by the commanders of the KPA and CPV. The Armistice Agreement also established Secretariats on both sides to assist the MAC, as directed. The Secretariats continue to operate today and maintain a 24/7/365 line of communication to support maintenance of the terms of Armistice. The first meeting of the MAC convened on 28 July 1953, with representatives from the UNC, Korean People's Army, and Chinese People's Volunteers. By 1991, the UNC Commander decided that timing was appropriate to designate a ROK military officer as the UNC's Senior Member to the MAC and as the Commander's lead delegate for maintenance and enforcement of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The decision came in part to facilitate inter-Korean engagement at a time when the two governments were seeking rapprochement. By then, the MAC had met over 450 times, but the KPA refused to hold any further MAC meetings with a ROK officer as the Senior Member. By 1994, the CPV formally removed its delegates from the MAC, though the KPA maintains a delegation within the Joint Security Area in Panmunjeom. All the while, UNC has maintained its position that its lead delegate for the Commission should be a ROK officer. The UNC Commander continues to appoint five individuals to the MAC. The current composition is one ROK Major General as Senior Member, one U.S. Major General, one British Brigadier, one ROK Brigadier General, and one rotating (on a six-month basis) Senior Officer from other countries (Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, France, New Zealand, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey) that maintain liaison with the UNC. The Senior Member continues to play an important role in Armistice maintenance and enforcement, including the issuance of directives for special investigations in response to alleged Armistice violations. ==See also== *UNCOK – the UN Commission on Korea *UNCURK – the UN Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea *Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission – the international Korean Armistice Agreement monitoring entity ==ReferencesCategory:United Nations operations in Asia Category:Korean Demilitarized Zone Category:North Korea–South Korea border Category:Aftermath of the Korean War Category:1953 establishments in Korea ","title":"United Nations Command, Military Armistice Commission, Korea"},{"id":"19284335","text":"Joseph Bonnell (August 4, 1802 – September 27, 1840) was a formally recognized hero of the Texas Revolution.

Brauner predicted the existence of the rare earth element promethium ten years before its discovery. ==Career== Brauner was a student of Robert Bunsen at the University of Heidelberg and later of Henry Roscoe at the University of Manchester. Brauner became lecturer for chemistry at the Charles University of Prague in 1883, assistant professor as of 1890, and full professor as of 1897. During the course of his career, he corresponded frequently with Dmitri Mendeleev, and they influenced each other as models for periodicity of the elements were developed. Brauner retired from the Charles University of Prague in 1925 and died of pneumonia in 1935. ==Scientific contributions== During Brauner's time with Roscoe at the University of Manchester, he became interested in the chemistry of the rare earth elements. A theme of his investigations was the determination of their relative positions in the periodic table. One method he used to separate these elements was fluorination, yielding compounds that could be purified. As part of his investigations on the chemistry of the lanthanides, Brauner proposed in 1902 the existence of an element that would be located between neodymium and samarium in the periodic table. Henry Moseley experimentally confirmed Brauner's prediction in 1914, identifying the element promethium. Brauner's investigations into the rare earth elements and their atomic weights depended on purity of the compounds under evaluation. This caused ambiguity at times. He proposed that the element tellerium had an atomic weight of 125 atomic mass units, although he acknowledged that his evaluation of tellerium could be based on mixtures of metals. Later, Brauner obtained samples of the substance referred to as didymium. In 1882, he was able to use spectroscopy to observe two groups of absorption bands, one blue (A = 449–443) and one yellow (A = 590–568). He concluded that didymium was actually a mixture of two rare earth elements. However, it was Carl Auer von Welsbach who recognized that didymium was actually a mixture of the two rare earth elements praseodymium and neodymium, the discovery occurring in 1885. Von Welsbach's discovery was initially a source of consternation to Brauner. Brauner authored the chapter on rare earth elements in Mendeleev's textbook \\"Principles of Chemistry\\". He also wrote the portion on atomic weights in \\"Handbuch der Anorganischen Chemie\\", which was a textbook authored principally by Richard Abegg. ==Honors== Brauner received honorary memberships to the Chemical Society of London, the American Chemical Society and the Societe Chimique de France, and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Manchester. The Recueil des Travaux Chimiques des Pays-Bas honored him in 1925 as did the Collection of Czechoslovak Chemical Communications in 1930. ==References== Category:1855 births Category:1935 deaths Category:Czech chemists Category:Rare earth scientists ","title":"Bohuslav Brauner"},{"id":"19284382","text":"Untitled, 1975, from his \\"Fields of Grass\\" series, by Duane Armstrong Duane Armstrong ladybug from Untitled, 1975, \\"Fields of Grass\\" series Duane Armstrong signature from Untitled, 1975 Duane Albert Armstrong (born December 25, 1938) is an American painter, best known for his oil on canvas paintings.

It is not to be confused with the King Cetshwayo Highway (P700) at Ulundi. == Route == The route starts in the Durban Central Business District. For the first few kilometres of its length, it runs parallel to the N3 on both sides as King Ndinuzulu Road North and King Ndinuzulu Road South (former Berea Road). At the Tollgate Bridge, it then turns to the south and passes through Mayville (where it is co-signed with the M10 for a few metres), before crossing under the N3 and passing through Sherwood. At 45th Cutting, the route becomes a dual- carriageway freeway for the rest of its length. The route passes over the N2 (providing no access to it), and passes through Westville and Cowies Hill. The route then briefly touches the N3 at the Paradise Valley interchange, before passing through Pinetown. After Pinetown, the route goes up Fields Hill, a 3km 1:15 gradient (this section is notorious for heavy vehicle accidents that can close an entire carriageway of the road). The route then passes through Kloof and Gillitts, before the R103 diverges, providing access to Hillcrest. The route then passes south of Hillcrest and through Assagay before merging with the N3, where it ends. The route is roughly 35km long. == Significance == The M13 is the main thoroughfare to Durban for residents of Westville, Pinetown, Kloof, Gillitts and Hillcrest. The M13 between the Paradise Valley interchange and its termination at the N3 used to be part of the N3 route until 1986, when the N3 was re-routed to pass south of Pinetown, Westmead and Winston Park.

The work was also released in other two German-speaking countries of central Europe, namely Austria and Switzerland. ==Music== The album mainly contains pop and dance- oriented tunes, and it is entirely produced by Limahl himself, with the help of a number of co-producers, including the Academy Award-winning English orchestra composer and pop musician Anne Dudley, and writer/producer Graham Stack, who has written and produced hit records for many artists including Kylie Minogue, Tina Turner, Take That, Rod Stewart and Steps, though Limahl's own record wasn't particularly successful at the time. In fact, none of the singles or the album itself ever entered the charts in any of the few countries of release. ==Editions== The 12-track Japanese edition also includes two bonus tracks, which are not featured on the 10-track German edition, these being \\"Stop (Long Dub Version)\\" and \\"Maybe This Time (Dub Version)\\", the original versions of which were both taken as singles to promote the album. Strangely enough, both of these singles were released under the semi- fictitious pseudonym \\"Bassline featuring Limahl\\", behind which lies the artist himself, appearing as \\"LUC\\", standing for \\"Limahl Under Cover\\". ==Singles== The album produces two more singles, i.e. the title track, \\"Love Is Blind\\", and a new remix, with a more modern sound, of \\"Too Shy\\", which, back in 1983, was originally a UK Number One for Kajagoogoo, the band Limahl was the lead singer of for a short while, in the first half of 1983, again in 2003–2004 for VH1 Bands Reunited series, and finally once again since 2008. With them, the singer is currently recording a new studio album and, at the same time, touring Europe: after debuting in Denmark and performing in Scotland, during two rock festivals in Summer, the tour will move to Germany, in November, and then to England, in December 2008. ==Release== In Germany alone, where either Kajagoogoo and Limahl's popularity, though a 25-year-long separation as a five-piece band, and almost as long an inactivity in general, was always maintained, Limahl's third solo work was first released in October 1992, and re-released in 1998. Unlike his first two long playing works, 1984 Don't Suppose and 1986 Colour All My Days, only out as vinyl LPs and as MCs, and never so far digitally re-released in their entirety, Limahl's third album was released exclusively as a CD, without being marketed anyway neither in the UK nor in any other countries outside Japan and central Europe, though fans' requests. ==Track listing== # \\"Love Is Blind\\" (Limahl) – 3:51 # \\"So Far So Good\\" (Limahl/Eric V.

A risk is any possible situation that is not planned for, but that, if it occurs, is likely to divert the project from its planned result. For example, an established project team plans for the work to be done by its staff, but there is the risk that an employee may unexpectedly leave the team. In Project Management, the Risk Management Process has the objectives of identifying, assessing, and managing risks, both positive and negative. All too often, project managers focus only on negative risk, however, good things can happen in a project, \\"things\\" that were foreseen, but not expressly planned. The objective of Risk Management is to predict risks, assess their likelihood and impact, and to actively plan what should be done ahead of time to best deal with situations when they occur. The risk management process usually occurs in five distinct steps: plan risk management, risk identification, qualitative and quantitative risk analysis, risk response planning, and risk monitoring and control. The central point of risk identification and assessment in risk management is understanding the risk. However, this is also where project managers and risk subject-matter experts (SMEs) get the least help from recognized references, best practices, or work standards. Currently, the Project Management Institute (PMIr) has a team of SMEs working on a Practice Standard for Risk Management. This team has identified one very good tool: the Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS). The RBS helps the project manager, the risk manager, and almost any stakeholder to understand, and therefore be able to identify and assess risk. == What is a \\"Risk Breakdown Structure?\\" == The RBS will prove extremely valuable to better grasp when a project needs to receive special scrutiny, in other words, when risk might happen. The RBS can also help the project manager and the risk manager to better understand recurring risks and concentrations of risk that could lead to issues that affect the status of the project. Following the concept of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), the Risk Breakdown Structure provides a means for the project manager and risk manager to structure the risks being addressed or tracked. Just as PMI defines the Work Breakdown Structure as a \\"deliverable-oriented grouping of project elements that organizes and defines the total work scope of the project...\\" the RBS could be considered as a \\"hierarchically organized depiction of the identified project risks arranged by risk category.\\" In project management language, risks include anything unplanned and unforeseen that can have a negative impact on the project’s costs, timing or quality. [This does not conform to the ISO 31000 view of Risk] A good project manager should be able to manage the risks effectively and get the project on track. Many project managers and risk managers currently use \\"home-grown\\" methods for listing, identifying, assessing, and tracking risks in their projects. These methods include: spreadsheets, listing, generic risk taxonomy, based somewhat loosely on various standards and guidelines. NIST Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-30/sp800-30.pdf NASA Procedural Requirements 8000.4: Risk Management Procedural Requirements http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?t=NPR&c;=8000&s;=4 PMI PMBOKr Chapter 11, Risk Management An approach that simply places the risks in a list, a simple table, or even in a database does not provide the strength of using a structured, organized method similar to a Work Breakdown Structure. To fully understand the risks and better identify and assess the risk, a \\"deep- dive\\" into each risk, recording as many levels of identification as necessary, may be required. The project value of placing risks in a structure such as this lies in the ability of the project manager and risk manager to then quickly and easily identify and assess the risk, identify the potential risk triggers, and develop a more robust risk response plan .IEC 62198:2001 Project Risk Management - Application Guidelines International Electrotechnical Communication, Geneva Switzerland If all risks are placed in a hierarchical structure as they are identified, and the structure is organized by source, the total risk exposure to the project can be more easily understood, and planning for the risk more easily accomplished. == Templates for creating a Risk Breakdown Structure == The concept of the RBS is new. The PMBoK (2004), barely references its use; however, the PMI Standards team has incorporated the RBS in the Practice Standard for Risk Management (draft for release in 2009). The PMBoK provides an example graphic of the RBS in Chapter 11, Figure 11.4. This reference has as major topics: Technical, External, Organizational, and Project Management. Another source http://certifedpmp.wordpress.com/2008/10/11/risk-breakdown-structure-rbs/ provides the following major topics: Technical, Management, Organizational, External, and Project Management. Dr. David Hillson, in the proceedings of the Project Management Institute Annual Seminars and Symposium, on Oct. 3-10, 2002,http://www.risk-doctor.com/pdf-files/rbs1002.pdf provided several different RBS Structure examples, with topics similar to those already shown. Dr. Hillson broke out two different examples, an RBS for Software Development, which had the following major topics: Product Engineering, Development Environment, Program Constraints; and an RBS for Construction Design, which has these major topics: Environment, Industry, Client, Project. Each RBS is broken into \\"levels\\", with each level providing a more in-depth \\"view\\" of the identified risk. As an example, in creating a RBS for software development, Level 1 of the RBS might be Technical, followed by Level 2, Requirements, followed by Level 3, Functional Requirements, Informational Requirements, Non- functional Requirements, etc. If desired, Level 3 can be further refined with Level 4, Stability, Completeness, Functionality, Interfaces, Testability, etc., Level 5, etc. Once the project team has created its RBS, then individual risks can be identified. Several different techniques for defining the individual risks are available, including brain-storming, surveys, workshops, etc. Each identified risk needs to be categorized, and placed in the RBS under a specific topic (or topics) if the risk spans two or more topics, such as a risk in gathering requirements might span Technical, organizational and project management. NOTE: the RBS will be different between projects, even projects within the same project area, e.g., construction, information technology, environmental remediation, etc. After the RBS has completed its first \\"pass\\" in the creation phase, it can then become an input to qualitative risk analysis, where probabilities, priorities, and impacts are determined. == Creation of tailor- made Risk Breakdown Structures == An example of designed tailor-made Risk Breakdown Structure, with results of a multi-objective risk analysis Construction projects, like all complex activities, involve many partners with different objectives, who are subjected to many risks in an uncertain environment. In practice, different project stakeholders have different understanding and perception of project risks. Each one identifies and analyzes the project risks regarding his objectives, risk attitude and special perspective to project risks without relying on a common and shared methodology. This is why in most of construction projects, discussing the project risks and making risk based decisions are of common difficulties which may also cause to disputes between project parties. Also, the project risk management is a scalable activity and should be commensurate with the size, level of available information and complexity of the project under consideration. Furthermore, this process is iterative, since in each phase of the project, new information is available and some predicted risks events occur while others will not, new unpredicted risk events may occur or may be identified, and the characteristics of those already identified may change. Thus, an iterative risk management should be carried out at all stages of the project life cycle. As consequence, the project risk management process has to be tailored for each particular case and project. Dr. Rasool Mehdizadeh has developed a methodology for a dynamic, multi-scale and multi-perspective risk management of construction projects.Dynamic and multi-perspective risk management of construction projects using tailor-made Risk Breakdown Structures http://ori-oai.u-bordeaux1.fr/pdf/2012/MEHDIZADEH_RASOOL_2012.pdf This method is based on the application of tailor-made risk breakdown structures (RBS) which are well adapted to: (1) the stage and degree of development of project, (2) specific requirements and objectives of project stakeholders, and (3) required level of details. Using this method, each of the project stakeholders, at each stage of the project, considering his/her special view to project risks, can build his/her own specific RBS. Moreover, the RBS can also be tailored as a shared support for all the project stakeholders in order to facilitate understanding and discussing project risks. Using these tailored RBSs which are all generated using a unique procedure and knowledge database, each of project stakeholders can identify, analyze and represent the project risks regarding his/her point of view and requirements. The method ensures the consistency of all these perspectives. == Using the hierarchical Risk Breakdown Structure == The RBS serves as more than just a \\"database\\" for identifying risks to the project. When created, the RBS provides a vehicle for risk analysis and reporting, and risk comparison across projects. Most importantly, the RBS is \\"the\\" tool for risk identification.Lev Virine and Michael Trumper. Project Decisions: The Art and Science. (2007). Management Concepts. Vienna. VAPeter Simon and David Hillson, Practical Risk Management: The ATOM Methodology (2012). Management Concepts. Vienna, VA. === Risk Identification and classification === Risk identification will be the first step in determining which risks may affect a project. Identification also provides documentation of the risk characteristics. The first level (Level 1) of the RBS can be used as a sanity check to make certain that all topics that might include risk are covered during the risk identification process. Using the RBS, an iterative process can be initiated that will persist throughout the project life-cycle. The frequency and applicability of this iterative process will be different in each phase of the life- cycleContinuous Risk Management Gudidebook, Richard L. Murphy, et al., SIE/Carnegie-Mellon University press. Using a risk identification checklist that is focused on the RBS, using Levels 2, 3 and below, assists in identifying specific and generic risks. This checklist can then become a part of the project managers' and risk managers' tool set for future projects. Risk identification leads to quantitative risk analysis, conducted by the Project Risk Manager. Sometimes merely identifying the risk will suggest the proper response, which can be entered into the Risk Response Plan. === Risk Analysis === Qualitative Risk Analysis Risk analysis is more easily achieved if, after identification, the risks are placed in proper perspective within the RBS by categorizing the risks in the various levels. Risk analysis involves the use of techniques for prioritizing the risk, determining the probability of the risk, and calculating the impact of the risk. At no point should the project manager or risk manager decide that the total number of identified risks should cause the cancellation of the project. The total number does not take into account the probability with which the risk will occur, nor the impact to the project, should the risk occur. A few risks, with high probabilities and high impact, are far more critical to the overall success of the project than a large number of risks with low probability and minimal impact. Using the RBS, the project manager and the risk manager should create a \\"risk score\\" based on the priority, probability and impact of each risk, and with each \\"group\\" of risks (according to the appropriate Level of the RBS). Using the RBS also offers other valuable understanding into the analysis of the identified risks. Some of these new understandings are: * Risk exposure type * Dependencies between risks * Root causality of risks * Most significant and least significant risks * Correlations between risks op cit Hillson, Another benefit of the RBS is the ability to focus risk responses to the high probability, high impact, high priority risks using the risk topic groupings.Virine, L., & Trumper, M. Project Risk Analysis Made Ridiculously Simple. World Scientific Publishing. 2017 A specific method was developed by Dr. Mehdizadeh in order to: (1) calculate risk values of risk events regarding different project objectives, (2) aggregate the risk values through the RBS branches and also (3) to calculate global risk score of project. The method combines consistently the quantitative and qualitative approaches, allowing the user to choose the best one for risk assessment at any level, based on the available information and required accuracy. In this method, at the first step, the probability and impact factors of risk events are assessed quantitatively or qualitatively. Two concomitant scales are used: a continuous cardinal scale and a discrete ordinal scale ranging from 1 to 5. Each scale has its own advantage. Continuous scale is closer to physical reality and has a more concrete meaning while discrete scale has a strong symbolic value. The assessments based on each of these scales can be converted to the other one following a defined process. At the second step, the risk values of risk events are calculated and then aggregated through the RBS branches in order to calculate the risk values of risk categories. Finally, application of a multi- criteria decision method allows calculating the global risk score of each category. This method provides a more consistent approach to get more realistic results without suffering from the usual weaknesses of available methods cited in literature. == Summary == Effective risk management demands that the project manager and risk manager fully understand the risks of a project. A successful risk management process would also require a good knowledge and understanding of the business objectives of the project. During risk identification, a large volume of risks can be identified. Simply listing these risks or putting them in a spreadsheet or database does not provide the in-depth understanding of the identified risks necessary to allow a solid risk response planning task. The RBS provides the tool necessary to assist in identifying risks, analyzing risks, and creating a successful risk response plan, and it provides a vehicle for \\"deep-dives\\" into the complexity of the risk. Using a hierarchical RBS, similar in its design to the WBS, allows the project and risk managers the opportunity to carefully align the risks in proper categories, using as deep an analysis as time and resources would permit.Project Management Institute, Risk Management Special Interest Group (SIG), http://www.risksig.com/ ==See also== *Risk *Event chain methodology *Risk register *Risk management tools *Issue log ==References== Category:Risk analysis ","title":"Risk breakdown structure"},{"id":"19284585","text":"In statistics, the Khmaladze transformation is a mathematical tool used in constructing convenient goodness of fit tests for hypothetical distribution functions. More precisely, suppose X_1,\\\\ldots, X_n are i.i.d., possibly multi- dimensional, random observations generated from an unknown probability distribution. A classical problem in statistics is to decide how well a given hypothetical distribution function F, or a given hypothetical parametric family of distribution functions \\\\\\\\{ F_\\\\theta : \\\\theta \\\\in \\\\Theta \\\\\\\\}, fits the set of observations. The Khmaladze transformation allows us to construct goodness of fit tests with desirable properties. It is named after Estate V. Khmaladze. Consider the sequence of empirical distribution functions F_n based on a sequence of i.i.d random variables, X_1,\\\\ldots, X_n, as n increases. Suppose F is the hypothetical distribution function of each X_i. To test whether the choice of F is correct or not, statisticians use the normalized difference, : v_n(x)=\\\\sqrt{n} [F_n(x)-F(x)]. This v_n, as a random process in x, is called the empirical process. Various functionals of v_n are used as test statistics. The change of the variable v_n(x)=u_n(t), t=F(x) transforms to the so-called uniform empirical process u_n. The latter is an empirical processes based on independent random variables U_i=F(X_i), which are uniformly distributed on [0,1] if the X_is do indeed have distribution function F. This fact was discovered and first utilized by Kolmogorov (1933), Wald and Wolfowitz (1936) and Smirnov (1937) and, especially after Doob (1949) and Anderson and Darling (1952), it led to the standard rule to choose test statistics based on v_n. That is, test statistics \\\\psi(v_n,F) are defined (which possibly depend on the F being tested) in such a way that there exists another statistic \\\\varphi(u_n) derived from the uniform empirical process, such that \\\\psi(v_n,F)=\\\\varphi(u_n). Examples are : \\\\sup_xv_n(x)=\\\\sup_tu_n(t),\\\\quad \\\\sup_x\\\\frac{v_n(x)}{a(F(x))}=\\\\sup_t\\\\frac {u_n(t)}{a(t)} and : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty v_n^2(x) \\\\, dF(x)=\\\\int_0^1 u_n^2(t)\\\\,dt. For all such functionals, their null distribution (under the hypothetical F) does not depend on F, and can be calculated once and then used to test any F. However, it is only rarely that one needs to test a simple hypothesis, when a fixed F as a hypothesis is given. Much more often, one needs to verify parametric hypotheses where the hypothetical F=F_{\\\\theta_n}, depends on some parameters \\\\theta_n, which the hypothesis does not specify and which have to be estimated from the sample X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n itself. Although the estimators \\\\hat \\\\theta_n, most commonly converge to true value of \\\\theta, it was discovered that the parametric,Gikhman (1954) or estimated, empirical process : \\\\hat v_n(x)=\\\\sqrt{n} [F_n(x)-F_{\\\\hat\\\\theta_n}(x)] differs significantly from v_n and that the transformed process \\\\hat u_n(t)=\\\\hat v_n(x), t=F_{\\\\hat\\\\theta_n}(x) has a distribution for which the limit distribution, as n\\\\to\\\\infty, is dependent on the parametric form of F_{\\\\theta} and on the particular estimator \\\\hat\\\\theta_n and, in general, within one parametric family, on the value of \\\\theta. From mid-1950s to the late-1980s, much work was done to clarify the situation and understand the nature of the process \\\\hat v_n. In 1981, and then 1987 and 1993, Khmaladze suggested to replace the parametric empirical process \\\\hat v_n by its martingale part w_n only. : \\\\hat v_n(x)-K_n(x)=w_n(x) where K_n(x) is the compensator of \\\\hat v_n(x). Then the following properties of w_n were established: * Although the form of K_n, and therefore, of w_n, depends on F_{\\\\hat\\\\theta_n}(x), as a function of both x and \\\\theta_n, the limit distribution of the time transformed process :: \\\\omega_n(t)=w_n(x), t=F_{\\\\hat \\\\theta_n}(x) : is that of standard Brownian motion on [0,1], i.e., is again standard and independent of the choice of F_{\\\\hat\\\\theta_n}. * The relationship between \\\\hat v_n and w_n and between their limits, is one to one, so that the statistical inference based on \\\\hat v_n or on w_n are equivalent, and in w_n, nothing is lost compared to \\\\hat v_n. * The construction of innovation martingale w_n could be carried over to the case of vector-valued X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n, giving rise to the definition of the so-called scanning martingales in \\\\mathbb R^d. For a long time the transformation was, although known, still not used. Later, the work of researchers like Koenker, Stute, Bai, Koul, Koening, and others made it popular in econometrics and other fields of statistics. ==See also== *Empirical process ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Theory of probability distributions Category:Empirical process Category:Transforms ","title":"Khmaladze transformation"},{"id":"19284595","text":"Domestic realism normally refers to the genre of 19th-century novels popular with women readers.

It was precipitated by the closing of fords, which in South Africa were known as ‘drifts’, hence the name. The Crisis has traditionally been seen as the precursor to the Jameson Raid and the uncompromising policies of High Commissioner for Southern Africa Alfred Milner which followed, and eventually led to the Second Anglo-Boer War (9 October 1899 - 31 May 1902). Historians generally regard the conflicts to have been between the Cape Colony and the South African Republic (SAR), informally known as the Transvaal Republic. ==Escalation== In late 19th century South Africa, the landlocked Transvaal was forced to rely on British colonial railways and ports. Therefore, Transvaal awarded the construction of a railway to the Netherlands-South African Railway Company (NZASM), however by mid-1891, the NZASM was on the verge of bankruptcy. When a European bond flotation became impossible, Cape Colony Prime Minister Cecil Rhodes offered a loan to Transvaal President Paul Kruger in exchange for building the Cape Line. Once the Cape Colony had finished building a railway line to Johannesburg, it attempted to get as much of the railway traffic of the Transvaal as possible by reducing its rates, as it was aware that the Delagoa Bay line at the Transvaal was almost complete. The Transvaal government increased the rates on the part of the railway that ran through the Transvaal, once it had crossed the Vaal River. In answer to this, goods were taken to the Vaal River by train and then taken further by wagon to avoid paying the higher prices in the Transvaal. Kruger reacted by blocking access to the Transvaal, closing the drifts on the Transvaal side. ==The Drifts Crisis== The Cape Colony attempted to get around this by unloading goods at the border and hauling them by wagon the or so to Johannesburg. There was no road bridge over the Vaal River which constituted the border; wagons had to make their way across by crossing fords, which in South Africa were known as ‘drifts’. The SAR responded by closing the drifts to all goods traffic. There was a great deal of anger toward this protectionism and exclusion, not only in the Cape Colony but also in the Orange Free State and among Afrikaners. The Afrikaner Bond supported the strong stand by the Rhodes government, urging action, even war, if the drifts were not reopened. Eventually, the SAR did relent, and the crisis passed. However, there were lingering clashes of interests. Afrikaners outside the SAR wanted access to the markets of the Rand and to share in the wealth being generated by the gold mining; the SAR government wanted to preserve markets for its own farmers, build up manufacturing to help employ its landless white burghers, and make itself as free as possible from influence by the British. ==Jameson Raid== The British government demanded that Kruger open the drifts and used the situation to involve itself directly in Transvaal affairs. Infuriated, Rhodes planned an uprising of Uitlanders in Johannesburg. The uprising was timed to coincide with an invasion of the Transvaal from Bechuanaland (present-day Botswana), led by Dr Leander Starr Jameson. Rhodes wanted to take over the government of the Transvaal and turn it into a British colony that would join all the other colonies in a federation. The Jameson Raid, which began on 29 December 1895, was a total failure. Jameson’s force was tracked from the moment that it crossed the border and first encountered resistance very early on 1 January when there was a very brief exchange of fire with a Boer outpost. Jameson eventually surrendered to Commandant Piet Cronjé, and the raiders were taken to a Pretoria jail. ==Aftermath== Rhodes was forced to resign as the prime minister of the Cape Colony, and the political problems between Afrikaans- and English- speaking colonists became worse than ever. The Orange Free State co-operated more closely with the Transvaal. Transvaal residents felt that they were being threatened and the Uitlanders were treated with more suspicion than ever before. Eventually this growing resentment accentuated itself into the Second Boer War. ==References== Category:Conflicts in 1895 Category:Second Boer War Category:History of South Africa Category:Military history of the British Empire Category:South Africa–United Kingdom relations ","title":"Drifts Crisis"},{"id":"19284902","text":"F71 may refer to: * , a 1968 British Royal Navy Leander-class frigate * , a 1970 Spanish Navy Baleares-class frigate * Moderate mental retardation, by ICD-10 code Category:Ship disambiguation pages ","title":"F71"},{"id":"19284929","text":"Holy Trinity Church, Southwell is a parish church in the Church of England in Southwell, Nottinghamshire.

In this novel Athanasiadis describes the way Greeks lived in Anatolia by the example of the small community of Salihli. Probably the title is inspired by the myth of Niobe. In 2004 the novel was serialized on Greek television.TV Episodes (in Greek). ==Plot summary== So we are in Salihli and watching life before the advent of the Greek Army. Central role played by the family of Michael Anastasiadis or Sarris, a middle-aged notable and a banker of Salihli with a charming, clever and cheated 35-years-old wife and four children (3 girls and 1 boy), madly in love with the 16-years-old Tarsi, a beautiful gazelle who refuses to marry the son of wealthy Turkish businessman, for whom she worked, and enchants everybody with her provocative teen flesh. In the meantime, we are watching the raids of the Turkish gendarmerie and terror they caused to the Greeks, the close relationship of Turks and Greeks as long as the one was not feeling threat from the other, hidden hopes for better days, the every day misdeeds caused by the human weakness and often leading to unexpected misery, mainly focusing on the guiltiness and the passion of Sarris for the 16 years old Tarsi. Then the novel described the pleasant (initially) life during the Greek occupation and the contact of the Minor Asian Greeks with the Greek soldiers who occupied Salihli to get up to the Destruction of Smyrna.

The program was created on 9 May 1967, and included military and civilian components of both governments. The objective of CORDS was to gain support for the government of South Vietnam from its rural population which was largely under the influence or controlled by the insurgent communist forces of the Viet Cong (VC) and the North Vietnamese People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN). A map of South Vietnam showing the provinces and military tactical zones (I, II, III, and IV Corps). Unlike earlier pacification programs in Vietnam, CORDS is seen by many authorities as a \\"successful integration of civilian and military efforts\\" to combat the insurgency. By 1970, 93 percent of the rural population of South Vietnam was believed by the United States to be living in \\"relatively secure\\" villages. CORDS had been extended to all 44 provinces of South Vietnam, and the communist insurgency was much reduced.White, Jeremy Patrick \\"Civil Affairs in Vietnam\\" Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington, DC., pp. 10-11 http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090130_vietnam_study.pdf, accessed 18 May 2014; Lipsman, Samuel and Doyle, Edward The Vietnam Experience: Fighting for Time Boston: Boston Publishing Company, 1983, pp. 74-76 Critics, however, have described the pacification programs and CORDS in terms such as \\"the illusion of progress\\".Fisher, Christopher, \\"The Illusion of Progress\\" Pacific Historic Review, Vol 75, No. 1 (Feb 2006), pp. 25-55 CORDS was, in the estimation of its first leader, Robert W. Komer, \\"too little, too late.\\"\\"Coffey, Maj. Ross \\"Revisiting Cords: The Need for Unity of Effort to Secure Victory in Iraq\\" Military Review, March–April 2006, p. 16 With the withdrawal of U.S. military forces and many civilian personnel, CORDS was abolished in February 1973. CORDS temporary successes were eroded in the 1970s, as the war became primarily a struggle between the conventional military forces of South and North Vietnam rather than an insurgency. North Vietnam prevailed in 1975. ==South Vietnamese attempts at pacification== The continuing struggle during the Vietnam War to gain the support of the rural population for the government of South Vietnam was called pacification. To Americans, pacification programs were often referred to by the phrase winning hearts and minds. The anti-communist Ngo Dinh Diem government of South Vietnam (1955–63) had its power base among the urban and Catholic population. The government controlled the cities and large towns but Diem's efforts to extend government power to the villages, where most of the population lived, were mostly unsuccessful. The Viet Cong were gaining support and mobilizing the peasantry to oppose the government. Between 1956 and 1960, the VC instituted a land reform program dispossessing landlords and distributing land to farmers.Hunt, Richard A. Pacification: The American Struggle for Vietnam's Hearts and Minds Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1995, pp. 11-15 In 1959, Diem revived the agroville program of the French era with the objective of moving peasants into new agricultural settlements which contained schools, medical clinics, and other facilities supported by the government. The program failed due to peasant resistance, poor management, and disruption by the VC using guerrilla and terrorist tactics. In 1961, the government embarked on the Strategic Hamlet Program, designed partly by Robert Thompson, a British counter-insurgency expert. The idea was to move rural dwellers into fortified villages in which they would participate in self-defense forces for their protection and isolation from the guerrillas. The United States Ambassador to South Vietnam Frederick Nolting and CIA official William Colby supported the program. General Lionel C. McGarr, chief of the Military Assistance Advisory Group in South Vietnam, opposed it, favoring instead a mobile, professional South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) undertaking what would later be called Search and Destroy missions rather than defending villages and territory.Ahern, Thomas, Vietnam Declassified: The CIA and the Counterinsurgency Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky Press, 2009, pp. 77-78 The program was implemented far too rapidly and coercively, and by 1964, many of the 2,600 strategic hamlets had fallen under VC control.Hunt, pp. 22-23 The next iteration of the pacification program came in 1964 with, for the first time, the direct participation in planning by the US Embassy and Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), the successor to MAAG. The Chien Thang (Struggle for Victory) pacification program was less ambitious than the Strategic Hamlet program, envisioning a gradual expansion, like an \\"oil spot\\" from government-controlled to VC controlled areas, by providing security and services to rural areas. Along with the Chien Thang program was the related Hop Tac (Victory) program, directly involving the U.S. military in pacification for the first time. Hop Tac envisioned a gradual expansion outward from Saigon of areas under South Vietnamese government control. These programs also failed as the ARVN was unable to provide adequate security and safety to rural residents in disputed areas.Hunt, pp. 25-30 ==Enter the Americans and the North Vietnamese== In 1965, both the United States and North Vietnam rapidly increased the numbers of their soldiers in South Vietnam. Communist forces totaled 221,000 including an estimated 105 VC and 55 PAVN battalions. American soldiers in Vietnam totaled 175,000 by the end of the year, and the ARVN numbered more than 600,000. Commanding General William Westmoreland rejected the use of the U.S. army to pacify rural areas, instead utilizing U.S. superiority in mobility and firepower to find and combat VC and PAVN units. Intensification of the conflict caused many peasants and rural dwellers to flee to the cities for safety. The number of internal refugees increased from about 500,000 in 1964 to one million in 1966. By December 1966, South Vietnam could only claim—optimistically in the U.S.'s view—to control 4,700 of the country's 12,000 hamlets and 10 of its 16 million peopleHunt, pp. 31-43 Robert Komer (left) meets with President Johnson. In February 1966, President Lyndon Johnson at a meeting with South Vietnamese and American leaders in Hawaii promoted the concept of pacification to \\"get the gospel of pacification carved into the hearts and minds of all concerned.\\"Hunt, pp. 70-71 Shortly after that he appointed CIA official and National Security Council member Robert W. Komer (\\"Blowtorch Bob\\") as his special assistant for supervising pacification. Komer's challenge was to unite the U.S. government agencies—the military, Department of State, CIA and the Agency for International Development—involved in pacification projects into a unified effort. Komer recommended the responsibility for pacification be vested in MACV, headed by Westmoreland, through a civilian deputy who would head the U.S. pacification effort commanding both U.S. military and civilian personnel. Although his proposal was unpopular in all the agencies, Komer, with the support of Johnson, pressed forward. As a halfway measure, the Office of Civil Operations (OCO) was set up with civilian leadership in November 1966, to coordinate all civilian pacification programs. OCO failed but strengthened Komer and Johnson's view that MACV leadership of the pacification program was essential. Komer believed that only the military had sufficient personnel and resources to undertake such an ambitious program.Hunt, pp. 71-85 == Development of the Program == Komer argued that the pacification success desired by Johnson could only be achieved by integrating three tasks. The first and most basic requirement for pacification had to be security, because the rural population had to be kept isolated from the VC and PAVN. If this was achieved, the insurgents' forces had to be weakened both by destroying their infrastructure among the population and by developing programs to win over the people's sympathy for the South Vietnamese government and the U.S. forces. The third point emphasized by Komer was that the new strategy had to be applied on a large scale in order to turn around what had been up until then, at best, an indecisive war.Andrade and Willbanks 2006: 81 Organizationally, these goals implicitly required that efforts be concentrated under a single command. In Komer's view, only the U.S. military had the resources and personnel to implement a large-scale pacification plan. After initial reservations, Westmoreland agreed with the plan, but civilian agencies still balked. Johnson overruled them, and on 9 May 1967, CORDS was created. Komer was appointed one of Westmoreland's three deputy commanders with the title of Ambassador and the equivalent rank of a three-star general. This was the first time in U.S. history that an ambassador had served under a military command and been given authority over military personnel and resources.Scoville, Thomas W. Reorganizing for Pacification Support Center of Military History, United States Army, 1982, pp. 60-65 http://www.history.army.mil/books/Pacification_Spt/Ch5.htm, accessed 18 May 2014; Andrade p. 14 Komer chose a military officer as his deputy and repeated the pattern of having either a civilian in charge of every component of CORDS with a military deputy or, alternatively, a military commander with a civilian deputy. He consolidated all the diverse pacification and civil affairs programs in Vietnam—military and civilian—under the authority of CORDS. Starting with a staff of 4,980, CORDS expanded to 8,327 personnel in the first six months of its operation. In 1968, CORDS was working in all 44 provinces and eventually was functioning in all 250 districts of South Vietnam.White, Jeremy Patrick \\"Civil Affairs in Vietnam\\" Center for Strategic & International Studies http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090130_vietnam_study.pdf, accessed 20 May 2014 About 85 percent of CORDS personnel were military, the remainder civilians.Coffey, Ross \\"Revisiting CORDS: The Need for Unity of Effort to Secure Victory in Iraq\\" Military Review, March–April 2006, p. 12 Each province was headed by a Vietnamese province chief, usually a colonel, who was supported by an American provincial senior adviser. The adviser's staff was divided into a civilian part which supervised area and community development and a military part which handled security issues.Andrade and Willbanks 2006: 83 et seq. ==Organization and Function== The local and regional militia forces were an important component of the pacification program to defeat the Viet Cong and provide security to villages. CORDS at the Corps level (I, II, III, and IV Corps) had an organization similar to its headquarters organization in Saigon. A three-star general headed each corps with a deputy commander for CORDS, usually a civilian. Within each Corps, all 44 South Vietnamese provinces were headed by a native province chief, usually an ARVN army colonel, who was supported by an American province senior adviser, either military or a civilian. The province adviser's staff was divided into a civilian part which supervised area and community development and a military part which assisted the Vietnamese with security operations.Andrade and Willbanks 2006: 83 et seq. CORDS focused on U.S. support for Vietnamese efforts at pacification in three broad areas: security, centralized planning, and operations against the VC. Komer quickly increased the number of U.S. military advisers assigned to the Regional and Popular forces (RF/PF) from 141 to 2,331. The advisers provided training and better weapons to the RF/PF and the South Vietnamese government expanded their numbers from 300,000 in 1967, to 517,400 in 1972. CORDS also facilitated the expansion of the National Police from 60,000 to 80,000 personnel.Stewart, Dr. Richard W. \\"CORDS and the Vietnam Experience: An Interagency Organization for Counterinsurgency and Pacification\\" Security Assistance: U.S. and International Historical Perspectives Leavenworth, KS: Combat Studies Institute Press, 2006, pp. 257-258 http://usacac.army.mil/cac2cgsc/carl/download/csipubs/2006Symposium.pdf, accessed 22 May 2014 CORDS also placed emphasis on improving South Vietnam's support and implementation of the Chieu Hoi program (encouraging defectors from the VC and PAVN), rural development programs, and generating fewer refugees from the war and taking better care of those who had become refugees. A major priority of CORDS was to destroy the VC's political and support infrastructure which extended into most villages of the country. The Phoenix Program was CORDS' most controversial activity. Seven hundred American advisers assisted the South Vietnamese government in identifying, capturing, trying, imprisoning and often executing members of the VC infrastructure. Between 1968 and 1972, the Phoenix program, according to CORDS statistics, neutralized 81,740 VC of whom 26,369 were killed. 87 percent of those deaths were attributed to conventional military operations by South Vietnam and the U.S.; the remainder were executed and, in the opinion of critics, were often innocent or non-combatants and were assassinated by \\"death squads.\\"Andrade and Willbanks, pp. 17-21 ==Tet and its aftermath== On January 24, 1968, Komer warned that \\"something is in the wind.\\" Seven days later the Tet Offensive was launched by the VC and PAVN. Tet weakened the Saigon government's presence in the countryside, which had been aided by CORDS. The RF/PF abandoned the countryside in some areas to defend cities and towns, suffering more than 6,500 casualties, including desertions. Tet was a military victory but a psychological defeat for South Vietnam and its American ally, but heavy VC casualties facilitated an early return to the countryside by South Vietnamese authorities and CORDS.Hunt, pp. 133-143 Project Recovery distributed food and construction material to rural dwellers and involved CORDS in reconstruction efforts in the cities and towns. By May 1968, the rural population living in \\"relatively secure\\" hamlets had returned to pre-Tet levels of 67 percent. Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker, CIA official William Colby, Komer's successor as head of CORDS and the new head of MACV, General Creighton Abrams, persuaded the South Vietnamese government to embark on an accelerated pacification program. The casualties suffered by the VC and the PAVN, during Tet and their subsequent offensives in 1968, enabled CORDS to strengthen its programs in the countryside.Hunt, pp. 144-159 ==Evaluations of CORDS== John Paul Vann (white shirt) and his CORDS staff at their Pleiku headquarters in 1968. In February 1970, John Paul Vann, CORDS head in the IV Corps area (the Mekong River delta south of Saigon), gave an optimistic progress report about pacification to the United States Senate. According to Vann, in IV Corps a person could drive during daylight hours without armed escort to any of the 16 provincial capitals for the first time since 1961. Fewer than 800,000 people out of the six million people living in IV Corps were in contested or VC-controlled areas. 30,000 VC had defected under the Chieu Hoi program. In 1969, the number of refugees had declined from 220,000 to less than 35,000, and rice production had increased nearly 25 percent. Vann, a civilian after retiring from the army as a Lt. Colonel, had 234 American civilian and 2,138 military advisers under his command. More than 300,000 armed Vietnamese soldiers, militia and police in the Corps area were being advised and assisted by CORDS.Vann, John Paul \\"Opening Statement\\" Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Feb 17-20, 1970, http://www.virtual.vietnam.ttu.edu/cgi- bin/starfetch.exe?vbD2hmHECIZKQUVMKlF7h33wD.1pjN0Bs@J7DG6RZzPTyDoG9j7hwX444GE72qP.bM1YIymqBmpBfX4yPa.STEvRw6QS.WQgYQog8VNzW6A/0440308002.pdf , accessed 27 May 2014 CORDS was designed to combat the peasant-based Maoist insurgency of the VC in South Vietnam. \\"One of the ironies of the Vietnam War is that the southern-rooted insurgency that prompted U.S. military intervention in the first place was significantly pacified – although by no means extirpated – by the time the last major U.S. ground combat forces departed South Vietnam.\\" The years, after reverses during Tet, from 1969 until early 1972 saw \\"uninterrupted gains in population security throughout South Vietnam and further erosion of the VC. The VC had only a minor role in the 1972 and 1975 communist offensives, the latter resulting in the conquest of South Vietnam by the conventional military forces of North Vietnam.Record, Jeffry and Terrill, W.

After the withdrawal from Vietnam of U.S. military forces and many civilian personnel, CORDS was terminated in February 1973.Jones, Frank L. \\"Blowtorch: Robert Komer and the Making of Vietnam Pacification Policy\\" Autumn 2005, http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/articles/05autumn/jones.pdf, accessed 27 May 2014 CORDS was successful in several ways. The program successfully integrated U.S. military and civilian efforts to defeat the insurgency in South Vietnam. Communication and cooperation between the U.S. and South Vietnamese government improved; CORDS revitalized several earlier failed attempts at pacification; CORDS leaders Komer and Colby persuaded South Vietnam to take the offensive in rural areas after Tet to challenge the long primacy of the Viet Cong in many areas of the country; and CORDS had some impact of persuading the South Vietnamese government to replace corrupt and incompetent officials.Jones, pp. 115-116 However, the CORDS pacification programs \\"could not overcome the South Vietnamese government's defective execution of plans and programs, its omnipresent corruption, or its inability to develop a sturdy, self-sustaining political base.\\"Jones, p. 116 In light of the outcome of the war, CORDS founder Komer attributed the eventual failure of pacification to \\"too little, too late\\".Coffey 2006: 100 Richard Hunt concluded similarly in his book Pacification: The American Struggle for Vietnam's Hearts and Minds that \\"the advocates of pacification hoped it would cause a fundamental transformation of South Vietnam. But even if that transformation had occurred it would most likely have taken too long and would in any case have exhausted the patience of the American people, inevitably eroding political support in the United States.\\"Hunt, p. 279 ==See also== * Phoenix Program == Notes  References == *Andrade, Dale; Willbanks, James H.

Only the women and girls are left, along with an old grandfather and a little boy. All of the men have disappeared on account of the Bosnian war. The most entrepreneurial of the women, Alma, a young widow, attempts to help the families survive by producing plum jam and pastries, but the village is too far away from the market to have any customers. Accidentally, she and another women meet a truck-driver from Zvornik, named Hamza, who offers to carry the goods to the market for them on the following Wednesday. However, he does not show up as agreed. Suddenly Miro and Marc, agents of a Serb-backed foreign company, enter the town and propose to buy the whole area for 70,000 marks. After discussing the proposal, half of the women of the village agree, hoping to gain a better life in town. However, Alma and her old and ill mother-in-law Safija resist, even as winter approaches and the village is at risk to remain completely isolated from the outer world. Following a malfunction of their car and a sudden storm, the contract dealers are forced to remain in the village: one of them, Miro, is injured, and finally reveals that the bodies of the lost children are buried in the Blue Cave. All of the villagers travel to find the remains and reconcile with their memories. The day after, the first snow begins falling down softly, as Hamza, the truck-driver who proposed to carry their goods to market, drives in. ==Cast== *Zana Marjanović - Alma *Jasna Beri - Nadija *Sadžida Šetić - Jasmina *Vesna Mašić - Safija *Emir Hadžihafizbegović - Mehmed *Irena Mulamuhić - Nena Fatima *Jelena Kordić - Sabrina *Jasmin Geljo - Miro *Dejan Spasić - Marc *Alma Terzić - Lejla *Muhamed Hadžović - Hamza *Benjamin Đip - Ali *Nejla Keškić - Zehra *Mirna Ždralović - Hana *Emina Mahmutagić - Azra ==External links== *Official website *Videos on making of \\"Snow\\" * Category:2008 films Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina films Category:Bosnian-language films Category:Bosnian War films Category:Films set in 1997 Category:Febiofest award winners ","title":"Snow (2008 film)"},{"id":"19284996","text":"Melitaea aurelia, or Nickerl's fritillary, is a butterfly of the family Nymphalidae.

The plant was founded in 1685, and was Germany's first Aktiengesellschaft, or joint stock company (1809). The first continuous-caster for slabs in the world was commissioned in Dillingen in 1962. A further machine, permitting casting of slabs of up to 400 mm in thickness - the thickest produced anywhere in the world at that time - was added, along with other new facilities, in 1998. In 2010, Dillinger Hütte successfully produced the first 450 mm thick slab - another world record. The principal equipment in the rolling mill now takes the form of two four-high stands, of which one is currently the largest in the world, with an effective rolling width of 5.5 m and a rolling pressure of 110 MN. ==Facilities== The Dillinger Hütte group also includes a further rolling mill operated by GTS Industries in Dunkirk (France). The group's parent company is DHS Holding, which owns 95.28% of the shares in the operating company, AG der Dillinger Hütte. Another 4.72% are held in free float. The company's products are marketed under the Dillinger Hütte GTS trade name. The shares in DHS Holding are owned 33.4% by the international ArcelorMittal steel group, with 33.75% held by Saarstahl AG and 15.00% by Struktur-Holding-Stahl. Reciprocal part-ownership exists with Saarstahl AG, in which Dillinger Hütte holds 25.10%. Dillinger Hütte also owns 50% of the ROGESA Roheisengesellschaft iron smelting company, whose blast furnaces, located on the Dillinger Hütte plant site, produce inter alia the \\"hot metal\\" (liquid pig iron) required for steel production. ROGESA itself also has a stake in the ZKS Zentralkokerei Saar coking-plant operator, the facilities of which also form part of the Dillinger Hütte site. Dillinger Hütte produces heavy steel plate, cast slag pots and semi-finished products, such as pressings, and (pressure) vessel heads and shell sections. Total production when the French subsidiary, GTS Industries, is included is well over two million tonnes of heavy plate annually, in a thickness range extending from 6 to 440 mm, making the company Europe's largest heavy plate producer. This robust material is used for fabrication of drilling rigs, ships, petrochemicals plants, bridges and heavy machinery; reference projects include the Öresund Bridge and the Millau Viaduct, the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban, and the luxury liner, Queen Mary 2. The striking arc of the Olympic Stadium in Athens was also welded from plate supplied by Dillinger Hütte. The main application for Dillinger Hütte's heavy plate output, however, is the making of large-caliber line pipe for major pipeline projects. The so-called thermomechanical rolling process, an extremely sophisticated rolling method which permits attainment of maximized mechanical properties combined with optimum working (bending and welding) characteristics, is used for these products. Dillinger Hütte is also a 50% owner of Europipe GmbH, Europe's largest manufacturer of large-caliber line pipe, with facilities in Germany, France and the USA. Dillingen is the only location in the Saar region at which iron is smelted. The jointly owned ROGESA blast furnace operator also supplies Saarstahl, the other co-owner, with hot metal. ==Uses== Further examples of the use of steel from Dillinger Hütte: * The Shanghai World Financial Center, the third highest building in the world (492 m) * The Commerzbank Tower in Frankfurt, Europe's highest office block * The New York Times Tower, in Manhattan * The turbines for China's Three Gorges Dam * The Erasmus Bridge, Rotterdam * In addition, plate from Dillingen has now also entered the world of the fine arts, in the form of sculptures by American artist Richard Serra, one of which is on view at the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao. ==History== In 1685, Louis XIV of France - the famous \\"Sun King\\" - granted approval to the Marquis Charles Henri de Lénoncourt for the construction of an ironworks, complete with a smelting furnace, before the gates of the fortress of Saarlouis. Locational factors for the founding of this works were excellent - the nearby Prims river supplied the necessary water-power, the surrounding woods the fuel for the furnaces, and the ore deposits in the immediate vicinity the feed materials for production. The first products were iron forgings, nails and cast artifacts such as pots, pans and so-called \\"Takenplatten\\", decorative iron plates that carried the heat of the kitchen over into the adjacent living space by conduction and radiation. Production was gradually optimized over succeeding years, with plate beginning to predominate in the mill's product mix as from 1802, following the construction of the first plate rolling-mill in continental Europe. These developments brought the factory to the forefront as Prussia's largest black and tin plate producer. With approval from emperor Napoléon Bonaparte, Dillinger Hütte in 1809 became Germany's first joint stock company, and one of the first in Europe. The company adopted the name Anonyme Gesellschaft der Dillinger Hüttenwerke in 1828. State-of-the-art rolling facilities and blast furnaces were installed, and by the beginning of the 19th century the workforce had grown to over 2,500. The so-called \\"Dillingen platemaker's gauge\\", covering twenty-four different plate thicknesses, had by then long become the definitive standard throughout Europe. Dillinger Hütte was also well ahead of comparable companies in the social sphere: an assistance and a pension fund were set up, and a works hospital, a residential estate for the plant's workers and a works school founded. The plant was 65% destroyed during the Second World War - nearly 200,000 shells fell on the plant site. The consequences were months of clearance work, and a completely fresh start. After the war, Dillinger Hütte continued to place its faith in the future of steel, investing in worldwide innovations, such as the first slab caster in 1962, the new heavy-plate rolling mill in 1971, the world's most powerful rolling stand in 1985, the slab caster for the world's thickest slabs in 1998, and the world's largest plate-edge miller, in 2005. An interesting but little- known fact: Dillinger Hütte workers have traditionally been dubbed \\"Hüttenbären\\", or \\"steel mill bears\\" in the local region. This led, logically enough, to the company's day-center for employees' children being christened \\"Kleine Hüttenbären\\", or the \\"steel mill cubs\\", at its opening in 2007. ==External links== * Dillinger Hütte GTS Category:Steel companies of Germany Category:Companies based in Saarland Category:Saarlouis (district) ","title":"Dillinger Hütte"},{"id":"19285004","text":"The Arboretum de Guignicourt-sur-Vence, also known as the Arboretum Victor Cayasse, is an arboretum located in Guignicourt-sur-Vence, Ardennes, Grand Est, France.

As a child, he roamed the streets of John John and Success Village, Laventille. As a boy, he watched pioneering tuners at work and came into contact with Winston \\"Spree\\" Simon who created the multiple notes on the convex metal containers used for making pans. These encounters sparked his interest in the steelpan and began his secret association with pan and panmen. Marshall began playing openly after his mother died in 1954, but had tuned his first pan long before that. At 14, he got an old ping pong from Tokyo Steelband and tried to retune it, using his harmonica. By 18 he began tuning pans, guided by other tuners such as Carl Greenidge. Mr. Marshall was dissatisfied with what he called ping pong's inferior tone. By 1956, Bertie Marshall had accomplished the most significant development in today’s steelpan tone, revolutionizing the method of tuning, by changing the instrument from the inharmonic style. By tuning the notes by octaves and introducing complex tuning techniques he produced harmonics, giving the steelpan its complex sound. By discovering and establishing this harmonic tuning method he is singularly responsible for the sound of today's frontline steelband instruments, brightening the overall sound in the process. Marshall is also credited with inventing the Double Tenor instrument and for being the first person to amplify the Steelpan. He developed the Quadrophonics, Six Pan and Twelve Bass together with Rudolph Charles of Desperadoes Steel Orchestra from Laventille. Marshall has been building and tuning instruments for Desperadoes since 1970. Marshall was part of a project of the Caribbean Industrial Research Institute in 1982 which investigated the possibilities of machine production of Steel Pans. Because of Marshall’s contributions to Trinidad & Tobago’s National Instrument, the T&T; government awarded him their Chaconia Gold Medal, given for \\"Outstanding Service to the Country\\". That was the first time the award was given in the field of music. He further received the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, presented by President George Maxwell Richards in 2008.Order of Republic ==Death== Bertie Marshall died on 17 October 2012, with his children at his bedside.

The largest Melitaea of the Old World, at least certain of its forms. The forewing much more pointed than in the previous species; equally variable in colour as well as the distinctness of the markings.The black markings are usually united, in some cases even covering nearly the whole wings, but in other cases may be strongly reduced. It is characteristic for this species that the reddish yellow submarginal lunate spot situated between the two median veins reaches with its vertex considerably farther into the disc than the other yellow lunate spots. This is especially the case on the forewing, but also on the hindwing the submarginal lunule between the 1. and 2. median veins projects farther basad than the others of the same row.Seitz.

They had not long to wait for their first success on the field when in January, 1906 they travelled to Abbey Park, Armagh, to take on the local Armagh Young Irelands (now known as Armagh Harps) - in the final of the county football championship. The newly formed St Killian's emerged victorious by a goal on a scoreline of 2-4 to 1-4. This was to be their only success in the senior championship. They had to wait until 1935 for their next championship success when they annexed the Junior title by defeating near neighbours, Clady, in the final. Six years later in 1941 they defeated the famed Clan na Gael from Lurgan to win the Junior title for a second time. Their opponents included within their ranks two Ulster and county stars in Eddie McLoughlin and a future President of the Association, Alf Murray. Whitecross had to wait until 1969 for their next victory in the Junior Championship when they defeated Ballymacnab by two points 0-4 to 0-2 in the final at the Athletic Grounds, Armagh. Nine years later they won the Intermediate Championship defeating Cullaville Blues after a replay which took place at Carrickcruppen. Another highlight of 1978 and indeed in the history of the club was the official opening of St Killian's' very own football pitch - Pairc Naomh Cillian - which was opened by Con Short, the then President of the Ulster Council of the GAA. Armagh played Down in the opening match and afterwards both teams, guests and friends were entertained in the Ardmore Hotel, Newry. The Club had its new hall and changing room complex opened by GAA President Jack Boothman, on 4 November 1995, and a club history was launched at the Annual Dinner in their new premises during February 1996. Whitecross were beaten in the 1995 Junior Football Championship Final by Ballyhegan in what became known as one of the best finals at any grade in Armagh football for several decades. They reached the final again in 1996. The St Killian's Senior team won promotion from the 2nd Division in 2005 and successfully fought off relegation in 2006. In 2007 the team was relegated back to Division 2, but won the Intermediate Championship. Whitecross won the 2016 Armagh Intermediate Football Championship. ==Achievements== * Armagh Intermediate Football Championship: (3) ** 1978, 2007, 2016 * Armagh Junior Football Championship: (4) ** 1935, 1941, 1969, 1995 ===Under Age=== In recent years St Killian's has fielded successful underage teams from U8, U10, U12, U14, U16 and Minor level. The U16 and Minor teams had been amalgamated with St Joseph's (Lissummon/O'Hanlons), but in 2008 St Killian's fielded its first ever U16 team which reached the Division 3 final.

He went to Ifriqiya, where he settled in Kairouan and studied under al-Kabisi (d. 1012). Some time later, he stayed in Cordova with Ibn Abd al-Barr and followed the lectures of various scholars there, which his biographers list. He is regarded a saint by later Sufi mystics. He played an important role in the history of the Almoravid dynasty. It was his teaching in Qayrawan (Tunisia) that first stirred Yahya ibn Ibrahim, who was returning from the Pilgrimage and attended Abu Imran's courses.

They were the first private gardens opened for public enjoyment in the United Kingdom, and were free to enter. The Grade II* listed gardens are within the Rushmore Estate in Cranborne Chase, an ancient royal hunting ground and now an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. ==Description== The gardens lie in the far south of Wiltshire, on the county border with Dorset, south of Tollard Royal village and about southwest of Rushmore House. They cover around . The main entrance is on the south side, where there is a two-storey lodge or caretaker's cottage, built in 1881. Apart from a central lawn the site is planted with mature trees, mostly conifers, oak, and yew, with laurel beneath, and is surrounded by further woodland on all sides except the south. Three Grade II listed buildings dating from around 1880 surround the lawn: the Temple, in limestone ashlar, octagonal with a domed roof and pedimented doors; and two timber-framed ornamental Indian pavilions, brought here and re-erected. Originally there were six pavilions, provided as places where parties could hold picnics while being entertained from a central bandstand. In 1895 an open-air theatre with a semicircular proscenium arch was added; called the Singing Theatre, it is also Grade II listed. Other buildings are the New Pavilion and the Jubilee Hall. The gardens are listed as Grade II* on the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England by English Heritage. == 19th century == In 1880, Augustus Lane Fox inherited the Rushmore Estate, centred on Rushmore House (now part of Sandroyd School); a condition of the will was that he should change his name to Pitt Rivers. He started making the Larmer Tree Pleasure Grounds almost immediately, and they were opened to the public in 1885. The gardens are named after the Larmer Tree, a landmark tree on the ancient county boundary. The tree was possibly an ancient Wych elm (Ulmus glabra) under which King John (1167–1216) and his entourage were reputed to have met when they were out hunting. The original tree was still living as late as 1894, around which time it was replaced by an oak, which was planted in the centre of the decayed rim. King John deer hunting, from a manuscript in the British Library Pitt Rivers built several structures around the main lawn which were intended to educate and enlighten visitors to the garden. There was also a racecourse, an eighteen link golf course, a bowling green and lawn tennis courts. There were eight picnic areas, each enclosed by cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus) hedges and with thatched buildings in case of inclement weather. Pitt Rivers provided \\"crockery, knives and forks for picnickers, gratis\\", as well as \\"chairs, tables and dumb waiters\\" and accommodation for 20 horses.Desmond Hawkins The Grove Diaries: The Rise and Fall of an English Family, 1809–1925 1995 University of Delaware Press, 310-11 Music and entertainment was provided at the Singing Theatre, where plays were performed by workers from the estate, and poetry recitals given. A band was provided on Sunday afternoons during summer. Thousands of Vauxhall lights, hanging glass lamps lit by candles, illuminated the gardens in the evening, when there was open-air dancing. On the night that Thomas Hardy danced with Pitt River's daughter Agnes in 1895, he described the gardens as \\"Quite the prettiest sight I ever saw in my life\\". By 1899 the gardens were attracting over 44,000 people a year, some of them making a day trip from the growing seaside resort of Bournemouth. A map of 1900 names the area as Larmer Park. After Pitt Rivers' death in that year the gardens closed, opening only occasionally after that time. ===Thomas Hardy and the gardens=== In early September 1895 Thomas Hardy and his wife Emma were staying with the Pitt Rivers at Rushmore. An annual sports day was held at the Larmer Tree Gardens on 4 September 1895, followed by a night-time dance. Hardy led off the country dancing with Agnes Grove, Pitt Rivers' youngest daughter and the wife of Walter (later Sir Walter) Grove. Agnes later became a literary pupil of Hardy's, and after her death in 1926 Hardy wrote the poem Concerning Agnes, reflecting on the night they first met.Michael Millgate, Thomas Hardy: A Biography Revisited 2006 OUP, 336-7 The first two stanzas read: :I am stopped from hoping what I have hoped before — ::Yes many a time! — :To dance with that fair woman yet once more ::As in the prime :Of August, when the wide- faced moon looked through ::The boughs at the faery lamps of the Larmer Avenue :I could not, though I should wish, have over again ::That old romance, :And sit apart in the shade as we sat then ::After the dance :The while I held her hand, and, to the booms ::Of contrabassos, feet still pulsed from the distant rooms.Thomas Hardy, The Works of Thomas Hardy 1994 Wordsworth editions, 838 == Restoration == Ornamental pond Restoration of the gardens started in 1991 under the direction of Michael Pitt-Rivers. Larmer Tree Gardens on the Garden Visit website Larmer Tree Gardens on 'Past'- the Newsletter of The Prehistoric Society (April 2000) In the 90-odd years that the gardens had been closed, the cherry laurel had taken over almost all the gardens apart from the main lawn, and many of the buildings had decayed. The gardens were re-opened to the public in 1995. In 1999 a new Larmer Tree was planted to mark the new millennium. ==Today== Nicolas Poussin's The Funeral of Phocion, a copy of which forms the backdrop to the open-air theatre at the Larmer Tree Gardens. Many of the Victorian buildings, including the Nepalese Room, the Roman Temple and the Colonial-style pavilion which was originally the Tea Room, remain. The open-air theatre has a backdrop painted by the scenery department at the Welsh National Opera based on The Funeral of Phocion, a 1648 painting by Nicolas Poussin which is in the National Museum Cardiff. Wide cherry laurel-hedged rides radiate out from the lawn, leading to woodland beyond. There are displays of camellias, rhododendrons, hydrangeas and eucryphias among the other trees and shrubs. Peacocks and free-flying macaws, neither indigenous to the United Kingdom, roam the gardens. The woods contain one of the largest discrete areas of semi-natural broad-leaved woodland in southern England, which were managed and exploited for the hazel underwood trades for many centuries, involving coppicing to produce strong, straight hazel wands. The gardens are privately owned and are open on a fee-paying basis from Easter to the end of September each year, but closed on Fridays and weekends as they are used for weddings and events. True to the spirit of Pitt Rivers, picnickers are encouraged at the gardens, croquet equipment and deckchairs are provided at no charge, and free music is played on Sunday afternoons. The gardens have been grant-aided by English Heritage. Film director Ken Russell first visited the gardens as a child and used the gardens in a number of his projects over the years, including The Debussy Film (1965) and The Music Lovers (1970). ==Festivals, events and concerts== Larmer Tree Festival in 2009 A music and arts festival, the Larmer Tree Festival, has been held at the gardens in July of every year since 1991. Another music festival, the End of the Road Festival, has been held in late August or early September since 2006; both festivals were cancelled in 2020 owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Enchanted Garden, a music festival that was part of The Big Chill, took place from 1998 to 2002. Other events and concerts take place at the gardens throughout the summer. In 1999 Dining with Alice, based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and produced by Artichoke, the company that went on to produce The Sultan's Elephant and La Princesse, was performed at the gardens as part of the Salisbury International Arts Festival. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Pitt Rivers, Lieutenant-General, 1890, King John's House, Tollard Royal, Wilts.

It is now an elected office, but was an appointed office prior to 1891. The current secretary of state is Republican Michael Adams, who was elected on November 5, 2019; he took office on January 6, 2020. ==History and name of position== Despite the fact that Kentucky designates itself a commonwealth, the office itself is still referred to as \\"Secretary of State\\" (unlike Virginia, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, which refer to the office as \\"Secretary of the Commonwealth\\"). The office was created by Article II, Section 17 of the Kentucky Constitution of 1792 simply as \\"the secretary\\". Article III, Section 21, of the Kentucky Constitution of 1850 changed the title of the office to Secretary of State. Section 91 of the Kentucky Constitution of 1891 (the most recent state constitution), changed the method by which the secretary of state is selected. Prior to 1891, the secretary was appointed by the governor; under the present Constitution, the secretary of state is elected by the qualified voters of the state. The most recent election was in 2019. In 1992, the Constitution was amended to allow the secretary of state to serve two successive terms.Executive Branch of the Office of the Secretary of State—History of the officeTimeline of legal changes to the Office of Secretary of State Emma Guy Cromwell ran for the office of Secretary of State, defeating another woman, Mary Elliott Flanery, and two men in the 1923 Democratic primary. In the general election, Cromwell went on to defeat her Republican opponent, Eleanor Wickliffe. She was sworn in on January 10, 1924 and became the first woman elected to statewide office in Kentucky. ==Structure and duties of the office== The secretary of state's office is composed of five divisions: *The Business Services Division is responsible for maintaining records regarding creation and status of corporations and business entities, registration of trademarks and service marks, recording liens made pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code. *The Elections Division certifies the name, party affiliation and ballot position of all candidates filed with him to the appropriate county clerks for ballot printing. The actual administration of elections is conducted by a separate, independent agency, the Kentucky State Board of Elections, of which the secretary of state serves as chair. *The Administrative Services Division appoints notaries public, issues apostilles, and serves as the registered agent for service of process in cases involving foreign corporations, as well as service of summons and petitions in actions against non-resident motorists. *Kentucky Land Office is an archive of land patents and land grants dating back to the colonial era. *Executive Branch of the Office of the Secretary of State files and maintains legislation passed by the Kentucky General Assembly and executive orders of the governor of Kentucky, including appointments to the Order of Kentucky Colonels. This division is also the keeper of the Seal of the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the personal seal of the secretary of state. ==List of secretaries of state of Kentucky== {  bgcolor=#cccccc  # bgcolor=#cccccc  Name bgcolor=#cccccc  Term of office bgcolor=#cccccc  Party - 1 James Brown 1792—1796 Democratic-Republican - 2 Harry Toulmin 1796—1804 Democratic-Republican - 3 John Rowan 1804—1807 Democratic-Republican - 4 Alfred W.

No. 9208, is a consolidation of Senate Bill No. 2444 and House Bill No. 4432. It was enacted and passed by Congress of the Philippines' Senate of the Philippines and House of Representatives of the Philippines (12th Congress of the Philippines, 2001–2004) assembled on May 12, 2003 and signed into law (List of Philippine laws) by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on May 26, 2003. It institutes policies to eliminate and punish human trafficking, especially women and children, establishing the necessary institutional mechanisms for the protection and support of trafficked persons. It aims \\"to promote human dignity, protect the people from any threat of violence and exploitation, and mitigate pressures for involuntary migration and servitude of persons, not only to support trafficked persons but more importantly, to ensure their recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration into the mainstream of society.\\" R.A. 9208 made the Philippines one of the few Asian countries in Asia that have enacted an anti-trafficking legislation. The law establishes an Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT), first chaired by Raul M. Gonzalez, and composed of government agencies, non- government organizations and other civic organizations for the effective formulation of a comprehensive and integrated program to prevent and suppress the trafficking in persons. The Development Action for Women Network (DAWN), PMRW member organization, and the National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women and the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women-Asia Pacific (CATW-AP) supported the successful passage of this law. This penal law was implemented by the issued \\"RULES AND REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING REPUBLIC ACT NO 9208 - Anti- Trafficking Act,\\" pursuant to the authority of IACAT under Sec. 29 of R.A. 9208. ==Background== \\"The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840\\" by Benjamin Haydon (1841). The elimination of slavery throughout the world was campaigned by early abolitionists, but it was not the objective of the earliest organised British movements. The Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, which established the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in Britain in 1787, campaigned for an end to the Transatlantic slave trade from Western Africa to the New World, which Britain dominated. Much later, the Anti-Slavery Society became the everyday name of 2 different British organizations. The first was the 1823 Society for the Mitigation and Gradual Abolition of Slavery Throughout the British Dominions (Slavery Abolition Act 1833), and the second, the 1839 The British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society - which is presently known as Anti-Slavery International. In America, the United States federal government severely punishes human trafficking both within its borders and beyond, making it, a federal crime under Title 18 of the United States Code. Section 1584 makes it a crime to force a person to work against his will, whether the compulsion is effected by use of force, threat of force, threat of legal coercion or by \\"a climate of fear\\" (an environment wherein individuals believe they may be harmed by leaving or refusing to work); Section 1581 similarly makes it illegal to force a person to work through \\"debt servitude.\\" Human trafficking as it relates to involuntary servitude and slavery is prohibited by the 13th Amendment. Federal laws on human trafficking are enforced by the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, Criminal Section. Human trafficking or trafficking in persons is a modern and new type of global slavery which deprives people of their rights and freedom. Southeast Asia is a source, transit and destination for men, women, and children trafficked internally and internationally for the purposes of sexual exploitation and forced labor. The Vatican \\"Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People \\"People on the Move\\" (N° 96 Suppl., December 2004) reported that: \\"Poverty, unemployment, underemployment, landless poor and armed conflict combine to deny many children and their families in rural areas in the Philippines a secure future. These areas include the Samar-Leyte region, Negros, Bicol, Cebu Province, and Mindanao, where unscrupulous recruitment agencies operate by using a combination of deception, false promises and cash incentives to win over the parents or the children directly. Groups are \\"subverting\\" the Internet to traffic women and children, and ease of travel has enabled pedophiles to move from one country to another. Mostly foreigners are the big investors in the Philippine sex industry. Child pornography brought in by tourists teach local children about the sex acts that can be done to the tourists. The children are used to sell souvenirs and trinkets along the beaches to the tourists, who then invite them to show them child porn videos and give them money to repeat the acts on them. ===Related Laws=== Human trafficking and the prostitution of children are significant legal and moral issues in the Philippines, due to control and power of organized crime syndicates. Enforcement of penal laws is, however, reported to be inconsistent. R.A. 9208 is only one of the laws which give protection to workers, children, and women, inter alia. The Philippines has a long history of legislation aimed at protecting the rights and welfare of children. The 1974 Labor Code of the Philippines (Presidential Decree No. 442) set the minimum age of employment at 15 years and prohibited the employment of persons below 18 years of age in hazardous undertakings. Presidential Decree No. 603 (The Child and Youth Welfare Code) permits the employment of children aged 16 years and below only if they perform light work, which is not harmful to their safety, health or normal development, and which is not prejudicial to their studies. Strict rules and regulations were issued on their rates of pay, hours of work and other conditions of employment. An employment permit also has to be secured from the Department of Labor and Employment. The 1992 child protection law, Republic Act No. 7610 (Special Protection of Children against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act) provides protection of children against abuse, commercial sexual exploitation, trafficking, and employment in illicit activities. Republic Act No. 7658 (amending RA 7610) set minimum age of employment to 15 years, and 18 years and above for hazardous work. Republic Act 7160 (The Local Government Code of 1991) includes provisions for the proper development and welfare of children at the basic political level, the Barangay. It enjoins local officials to promote and support activities for the protection and total development of children, particularly those below seven years of age, and adopt measures to prevent and eradicate drug abuse, child abuse, and juvenile delinquency. Republic Act No. 9231 (19 December 2003 - An Act Providing for the Elimination of the WFCL and Affording Stronger Protection for the Working Child) - amends R.A. No. 7610 by embodying the State policy to provide special protection to children from all forms of abuse, neglect, cruelty, exploitation and discrimination, and conditions prejudicial to their development, including child labour and its worst forms. It also provides stiffer penalties for their commission. It spells out the WFCL, consistent with Convention No. 182; the hours of work of working children; and ownership, usage and administration of the working child’s income. Further, it ensures working children’s access to education and training, and immediate legal, medical and psychosocial services.dol.gov/ilab, Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) - U.S. Department of ... A new counter-trafficking law, Republic Act No. 9208, was enacted in May 2003 In September 1995, then President Fidel V. Ramos signed Executive Order No. 275 creating a special oversight committee for the special protection of children from all forms of neglect, abuse, cruelty, exploitation, discrimination and other conditions prejudicial to their development. ==Statistics== A 1997 ILO report placed the number of child victims of prostitution at 75,000 in the Philippines, with other estimates (ECPAT) reporting as many as 100,000. Recently, around 300,000 prostitutes were found in a range of entertainment establishments, such as karaoke bars, dirt poor cabarets, beach resorts, and health clubs. Child prostitution is one the rise, estimated by ECPAT.org to be about 100,000. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported about 60,000 to 100,000 children in the Philippines involved in prostitution. There was a high incidence of child prostitution in tourist areas, where undetermined number of children are forced into exploitative labor operations.http://www.unicef.org/media/files/ipulocaltrafficking.doc According to a report by the Consortium Against Trafficking of Children and Women for Sexual Exploitation (Catch-Wise), the Philippines is the 4th country with the most number of prostituted children,childprotection.org.ph, Facts and Figures and authorities identified increases in pedophiles travelling to the Philippines.ecpat.org.nz ECPAT New Zealand  What's New! < The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women - Asia Pacific (CATW-AP) , quoting from Kyodo News, estimated that in 1998 there were 400,000 women working in prostitution in the Philippines. The International Labor Organization estimated that in 1993/94 there were nearly half a million prostitutes in the country. The Commission on Filipinos Overseas (CFO) recorded 959 Philippine human trafficking cases from 1992 to March 2001. The United Nations reported 9 million people enslaved in the global sex trade by powerful syndicates in human trafficking in 1999 (Coalition Against Trafficking in Women – Asia Pacific, CATW-AP). The Philippines was the first Southeast Asian country to legislate this tough statute against trafficking.Philippines: The prevalence of human trafficking ==Prosecution== R.A. 9208, specifically criminalizes trafficking for the purposes of exploitation. The punished overt acts include trafficking under the guise of arranged marriage, adoption, sex tourism, prostitution, pornography, or the recruitment of children into armed conflict. Trafficking of children is made a “qualified” offense, and higher penalties of life imprisonment and a fine of 2 million to 5 million pesos (USD 36,085 to 90,212) are imposed. Use of services of trafficked persons is penalized by 15 years imprisonment and a fine of 500,000 to 1 million pesos. Additional penalties are provided for government employees offenders. Sec 10 (c) provides for the maximum penalty for qualified trafficking under Section 6: life imprisonment and a fine of not less than 2 million pesos (P2,000,000.00) but not more than 5 million pesos (P5,000,000.00). As complementary legislation, slavery and forced labor are also punished under Articles 272 and 274, Revised Penal Code of the Philippines, and Republic Act No. 7610, the \\"Special Protection of Children Against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act.\\" This law protects children under 18 years from all forms of abuse, cruelty, and exploitation and prohibits child prostitution and child trafficking. The US report scored there was only 1 conviction under the 2003 anti-trafficking law during the reporting period, but the government made some improvement in arresting, prosecuting, and convicting traffickers. Penalties imposed for trafficking for commercial sexual exploitation are commensurate with those for rape. A Zamboanga City RTC sentenced a member of a trafficking syndicate to life imprisonment in March 2007 for having recruited 6 victims and peddled them to a brothel in Sandakan, Malaysia. The case was the 5th conviction under R.A. 9208 which resulted in a jail sentence. In 2006, the public prosecutors filed 60 new trafficking cases with the Department of Justice (Philippines), and more than 107 pending prosecutions of trafficking crime. The government appointed 17 DOJ anti-trafficking prosecutors, and 72 additional Fiscals in its regional offices. In Northern Mindanao, however, the report of the Sub-Committee on Human Trafficking (SCHT) submitted to the Executive Committee of the Regional Law Enforcement Coordinating Council (RLECC), Region 10 states that lack of access to legal information, aid or protection tops the list of issues and problems in the implementation of Republic Act No. 9208.gov.ph/news, Lack of access to legal info, aid mars effective implementation of RA 9208 ==ResultsTrafficking in Persons Report: PHILIPPINES (Tier 2)=== On June 3, 2005, the United States Department of State- Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons released its 2005 Trafficking in Persons Report which put the Philippines in Tier 2 Watch List Category. Countries included under the said category are those whose governments do not fully comply with the standards of the US Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards. The US report, said that: ===IACAT-DOJ Raul M. Gonzalez statement=== On 6 June 2005 Department of Justice (Philippines) Secretary Raul M. Gonzalez issued the government's official statement on R.A. 9208 vis-a-vis the U.S. State Department Report.doj.gov.ph, STATEMENT ON THE 2005 TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS REPORT OF THE US STATE DEPARTMENT Gonzales reported that: ===2008 IACAT report=== As of June 30, 2008, the IACAT Chairman reported that it secured the conviction of Ms. Nelia Ogalesco, bringing the total number of convictions to 11, under Republic Act 9208: ==Confidentiality of proceedings== Republic Act No. 9208 (the Anti-Trafficking Law) provides for confidentiality of proceedings at any stage of the investigation, like similar enacted legislation, to wit: RA No. 9344 (the Juvenile Justice Law) mandates that all records and proceedings involving children in conflict with the law from initial contact until final disposition of the case shall be considered privileged and confidential. RA No. 9262 (the Anti-Violence Against Women Law) provides that all records pertaining to cases of violence against women and their children shall be confidential... and the right to privacy of the victim shall be respected. RA No. 8369 (the Family Court Act) provides for the confidentiality of all records of cases and the identity of the parties involved therein unless necessary and with court authority. Thus, the identity of a child victim of abuse, child witness, CIAC or a CICL shall not be disclosed whether directly or indirectly. No information that would lead to the identity of the child or any member of his family shall be published or broadcast. Photographs, images, or video coverages of the face or any distinguishing feature of a child victim of abuse, child witness, CIAC or a child in conflict with the law including his or her family members shall not be taken, published, or shown to the public in any manner. The use of sexualized images of children is considered a violation of the child’s rights. The disclosure of any private or graphic detail of the case, including the medico-legal findings, in public, is strictly prohibited. It is absolutely prohibited to access, use or in any manner disseminate a child’s case files or records. Ricardo R. Blancaflor, acting chairman of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT), called for the amendment of the anti-trafficking law due to the increasing number of “sexually trafficked\\" Filipino women workers, most especially in Singapore. GABRIELA Representative Liza Maza reported that 400,000 migrants were being trafficked internally and another 800,000 externally. Blancaflor, however, cited 11 convictions and 3 more cases submitted for decision under the law. But Blancaflor noted the confidentiality clause, Section 7, R.A. 9208 for possible amendment, it, being a bar for full disclosure of facts. ==Protection== The Philippine government relied heavily on NGOs and international organizations to provide services to victims. Victims were encouraged to file civil cases against traffickers, and the former are not penalized for any crimes committed as a direct result of their being trafficked. The implementing rules and regulations of the 2003 anti- trafficking law outline identification and referral procedures. The government assisted victims by providing temporary residency status, relief from deportation, shelter, and access to legal, medical, and psychological services. The Department of Social Welfare and Development established 42 temporary shelters for victims and 13 of these were supported by a non-profit charity organization. The government sent 8 social workers to Philippine diplomatic missions to provide psychosocial counseling to overseas Filipino workers in distress. The Philippine Ports Authority provided the building and facilities for halfway houses in Manila, Davao, Batangas, and Sorsogon, managed by an NGO; the Ports Authority, police, and the Coast Guard referred victims to the halfway houses. In March 2007, the Department of Labor and Employment opened the first reintegration center where returning overseas Filipino workers may seek services such as skills training, psycho-social counseling, and business development assistance. This law saves and protects many women and children from and against prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage, both domestic and overseas. R. A. Sec. 4b of 9208 supplements the Anti Mail- order bride law which only prohibits matching of Filipino women for marriage to foreign nationals on a mail-order bride formula, for this law punishes \\"introducing or matching any Filipino woman to a foreign national for marriage for the purpose of acquiring, buying, offering, selling, or trading her to engage in prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude or debt bondage is also considered an act of trafficking.\\" RA 9208 directs the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), and the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) to establish programs for Filipinos who are trafficked overseas, to ensure the safety of overseas Filipinos. This law covers both national and international migration, and requires the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Department of Justice (DOJ), Bureau of Immigration (BI), Philippine National Police, Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG), NCRFW, and local government units (LGUs), to establish programs to prevent, protect, and rehabilitate trafficked victims. ==Legal gaps, hiatus and amendment of the law== Department of Social Welfare and Development Secretary Esperanza Cabral, Co-Chair of the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking Forum stated on October 19, 2008, that \\"while Republic Act No. 9208 prohibits the recruitment or abduction of people for the purpose of selling their organs, an IRR specifically dealing with organ trafficking would 'address the apparent gaps in the law and existing policies' on the ‘donation’ of organs by a living non-related donor. The 1991 World Health Organization Guiding Principles on Human Organ Transplantation will limit the terms of the proposed Implementing Rules and Regulations.\\" ===Prevention=== In 2007, the government's Interagency Council Against Trafficking established its first Ninoy Aquino International Airport anti- trafficking task force. In 2006 the Philippine Overseas Employment Agency (POEA) increased the minimum monthly wage from $ 200 to $ 400 and raised the minimum age from 18 to 23, and it required prospective domestic workers to get a certificate of competency from the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority and the Overseas Workers' Welfare Administration. In 2006, POEA conducted 1,000 pre-employment orientation seminars for more than 60,000 departing overseas Filipino workers. The Task Force Against Illegal Recruitment was created to develop strategies against illegal recruitment activities. On September, 2008, an intensified campaign against human trafficking (\\"massive exploitation of safe migration\\") was launched by the Visayan Forum Foundation, Inc. (VFFI), a non-governmental organization with the support of the United States Ambassador to the Republic of the Philippines, United States embassy. Kristie A. Kenney said at the launch: \\"Human trafficking is a global problem. It is modern-day slavery and victims rarely have a voice.\\" The VFFI provide halfway houses for trafficking victims, and the Philippine Ports Authority built halfway houses in ports for rescued victims. But DOJ Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking said that the campaign against human trafficking had no budget. The Recovery Empowerment Networking and Employment for Women Foundation (RENEW), founded in 2005, has set up a prevention program in partnership with the Department of Social Policy and Social Work at the University of Oxford (UK) and Systems Plus College Foundation (Philippines). This prevention program involves identifying female youth who are most at risk of being trafficked and/or prostituted and inviting them to enter the RENEW programand has been recognised as a best practice model by the National Women's Summit held in Manila in 2009, Soroptimist International in 2010, and the Coalition Against the Trafficking of Women (CATW) in 2011. ===Senate inquiry=== On September 15, 2004, the first hearing was held on escort services. followed by a second hearing on September 22, 2004, attended by well-known movie personalities and a third hearing, attended by representatives from KTVs. Philippines Senator Ramon Bong Revilla, Jr., on July 26, 2006, called for coordination with the Philippine National Police vis-a-vis the public, the whistle blowers and anti-prostitution Internet online petitioner initiators, to shed light and solve the alleged prostitution in the Philippines, sexual slavery or trafficking in human beings dens in Angeles City, Pampanga. Revilla re-filed Senate Bill No. 12, the \\"Anti Pornography Bill.\\"senate.gov.ph, REVILLA ASKS \\"SEX SLAVE CAMP\\" WHISTLEBLOWER TO SURFACE However, Angeles City police Chief Sonny Cunanan denied the allegations, alleging \\"the Women's and Children's Concerned Section (WCCS) and other agencies of the Angeles City Government that are responsible for the regular inspection of different bars and nightclubs have no records about the existence of a sex slave camp in the city.\\" But he confirmed that \\"Angeles intelligence policemen, in coordination with other counterparts, were directed to look into the veracity of the report and file necessary charges against the operators of the illegal activities if these really exist.\\"sunstar.com.ph/static/net, Cop chief denies sex slave camp in Angeles ===Batingaw Network=== On September 15, 2007, the Children and Youth Secretariat of the Anti-Child Pornography Alliance (ACPA-Pilipinas) launched Batingaw Network to protect and save children from all abuses and exploitations.

It tells the story of a thief named James and the girl Red Molly whom he charms with a ride on his 1952 Vincent Black Lightning motorcycle. In 2011 Time magazine listed the song in its \\"All TIME 100 Songs\\", a list of \\"the most extraordinary English-language popular recordings since the beginning of TIME magazine in 1923,\\" praising it as \\"a glorious example of what one guy can accomplish with just a guitar, a voice, an imagination and a set of astonishingly nimble fingers.\\"\\"All-TIME 100 Songs: 1952 Vincent Black Lightning\\" (retrieved on Feb. 26, 2014). Despite not being issued as a single, the ballad became a fan favourite and is one of Thompson's most highly acclaimed solo compositions. A live version of the song appears on Thompson's album Two Letter Words: Live 1994. The band Red Molly, who has covered the song, takes its name from the lead female character in the song.Extended Bio (accessed March 7, 2011) from redmolly.com ==The motorcycle== A Vincent Black Lightning The song focuses on the main character's love for both his girlfriend and his 1952 Vincent Black Lightning, a rare British motorcycle of which perhaps 30 were made. The character James compares it to other cycles of the age in his dying speech: > Says James, in my opinion, there's nothing in this world > Beats a '52 Vincent and a red headed girl. > Now Nortons and Indians and Beezers won't do > They don't have a soul like a Vincent '52. While most cover versions of this song by different artists remain with the original lyrics listing those same three makes of motorcycle (that \\"don't have a soul like a Vincent '52\\"), Thompson himself often varies the makes for live recordings, broadcasts and performances. He adds or replaces with the following makes: Triumph, Harley, Enfield, Douglas, Rudge, Matchless and Ducati. Interviewed in the 2003 BBC Four documentary Solitary Life, Thompson said: \\"When I was a kid, that was always the exotic bike, that was always the one, the one that you went \\"ooh, wow\\". I'd always been looking for English ideas that didn't sound corny, that had some romance to them, and around which you could pin a song. And this song started with a motorcycle, it started with the Vincent. It was a good lodestone around which the song could revolve\\". ==Covers== The song has been covered by several artists: * Greg Brown, on The Live One (1995) * Jeff Lang, on Disturbed Folk (1995) and Disturbed Folk vol. 2 (1999) * Dick Gaughan, on Sail On (1996) * Mary Lou Lord, on Live City Sounds (2001) * Del McCoury Band, on Del and the Boys (2001) * The Mammals, on Evolver (2002) * Reckless Kelly on Reckless Kelly Was Here (2006) * Jim Henry, on King of Hearts (2008) * Joel Fafard on Cluck Old Hen (2010) * Bob Dylan, during a concert at Clarkston, Michigan on 14 July 2013. * Sean Rowe, as a frequent concert staple * Red Molly on The Red Album (2014) * Robert Earl Keen on Happy Prisoner: The Bluegrass Sessions (2015) * Jack & Amanda Palmer on You Got Me Singing (2016) When Thompson heard Dylan's cover of the song, he said, \\"It was a surprise, totally.

I thought it was a joke!\\" American artists who cover the song frequently change the place reference, Box Hill to Knoxville. ==References== Category:Richard Thompson (musician) songs Category:1991 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Mitchell Froom Category:Songs written by Richard Thompson (musician) ","title":"1952 Vincent Black Lightning"},{"id":"19285375","text":"Buddhism in Northern Karnataka has seen major development after the discovery of an Ashoka inscription at Maski in Raichur District a few decades ago and of a Buddhist settlement through a series of archaeological excavations at Sannati which have shed light on the historic significance of Karnataka. During 1954-95, 81 stone inscriptions, 2 stupas, 3 dibbas or mounds and a defence fort have been discovered at Sannati. ==History== Buddhism had in fact entered Karnataka before the time of the Emperor Ashoka, and that it enjoyed its heyday between the 3rd century B.C. and the 3rd century A.D. ===Mauryas=== Buddhism first emerged during Mauryas times when there was a missionary zeal. Parts of Karnataka were subject to the rule of the Mauryas. Chandragupta Maurya's son Bindusara (298-273 BC) and Bindusara's son Ashoka (269-232 BC) caused some of his edicts to be put up here. Ashoka's grandson Samprati Chandragupta is believed to have come to Shravanabelagola where he spent his last years. Eleven Ashokas edicts: 4 in Bellary District, 3 in Raichur District and 3 others in Chitradurga District bear witness to the Mauryas presence in Karnataka. ===Satavahana=== The Satavahana may have been a Karnataka dynasty, as Dharwad and Bellary Districts are called Shantavahani Hara (or Shantavahana region). Some of their kings were called rulers of Kunthala, the old name for Karnataka. The Satavahana were successors to the Mauryas and ruled in Banavasi, as is evident from the Nasik inscription of Gautamiputra Satakarni and the copper plates from Hirehadagali. At Sannati in Gulbarga District, as well as Vadgoan Madhavpur near Belgaum and Brahmagiri in Chitradurga District, there are remains of monuments of their period. The Uttara Kannada area of Banavasi has their inscription at Vasan in Dharwad District, and there are remains of a brick temple. ===Kadamba=== Kadambas capital was also Banavasi, known as Vaijayanti. They were tolerant towards Buddhism as epigraphic evidence shows. Recent excavations of the site of Banavasi have given the remains of a Buddhist stupa. The large apsidal structure is what remains and it was planned like a dharma chakra. Kadambas century was a prominent one for Buddhism in Karnataka. Chinese traveller, Hieun Tsang, visited Banavasi in the 7th century AD and saw 1000 sangharamas and three stupas. He said \\"By the side of the royal palace was a great sangharama with 300 priests, all men of distinction. This convent has a great vihara 100 in height\\". ==Buddhist temple in North Karnataka== * Aihole Aihole, is today an insignificant village in Bagalkot District of North Karnataka. This place was a workshop for temple architects and sculptors patronized by early Chalukyas monarchs. Here are some of the earliest structural temples in stone in the country, dating from 450 AD, including one of the 4 Buddhist shrines in Karnataka. Aihole's hillock, Meguti, to the rock cut Buddhist shrine. It is the most important surviving Buddhist temple in Karnataka. The Buddhist Chaitya at Aihole, is pre western Chalukyas and indicates the influence of Mahayana. It was built around the 5th century and is 25 feet high. * Sannati Sannati, Chitapur Taluk, Gulbarga District, on both banks of the river Bhima, that many Buddhist stupas of the Shatvahana times have been found. Sannati, which date back to the 1st to 3rd century AD, the oldest among the Karnataka Buddhist sites and monuments. Sannati which resembles Amravati and was the Buddhist centre of the Shatvahana period of pre Christian era and stands as a significant cluster of dozens of Buddhist relics, which include 2 stupas, 3 mounds, 1 fortification, 4 major rock edicts and more than 75 contemporary inscriptions. All scattered across a compact area of about 10 square kilometres. Sculptures can be seen all along and the Buddhist ruins found there are in large numbers. They include remnants of stupas, stone pottery for holy bones and ayaka stambha which has symbolic representation of birth, parinishnishkramana, enlightenment, preaching and nirvana (salvation) of Buddha. ===Inscriptions=== Inscriptions in the Brahmi script contain names of those who gave grants to sangharama, stupas and viharas. * Badami Badami, the erstwhile capital city of the western Chalukyas in the 6th century. These rulers were also associated with Buddhism and relics here have survived in the shape of a Buddhist cave. There is also a figure, identifiable as Padmapani, the Bodhisattva of the same period. The Chinese traveller Xuanzang (Hieun Tsang) has stated that during the time of Pulakeshin II in 642 AD in Banavasi or Konkanpura, there were 400 Sangharamas and 10000 followers of Buddhism. * Dambal (in Gadag District, there was a Buddhist centre as during 12th century) ===Inscription=== A Dambala inscription of 1095 AD, begins with the customary invocation namo buddhyana and goes go to describe at length the greatness of Tara bhagavati.

Originally only released on vinyl album and cassette, the album was not released on compact disc until 2012 on the Gold Legion label, though several songs from the album had appeared on other albums. The compilation album The Best of Limahl features eight tracks from Don't Suppose, and the compilation Neverending Story—Best of Limahl features five tracks. The song \\"Tar Beach\\", which appears on neither of those albums, is featured on two joint compilations with Kajagoogoo. \\"The Greenhouse Effect\\" has never been officially released on compact disc. (Later editions of Don't Suppose replaced \\"The Greenhouse Effect\\" with \\"The NeverEnding Story\\".) ==Editions== The album was released twice, in two slightly different editions. The second edition omitted \\"The Greenhouse Effect\\", which came at the end of side one; it was replaced with the hit single \\"The NeverEnding Story\\", from the soundtrack to the film The NeverEnding Story. The new track was composed by Tirolean producer Giorgio Moroder; Moroder also authored the instrumental B-side on the single release of \\"Ivory Tower\\", as well as most of the singer's second solo album, Colour All My Days. Limahl came to know Moroder while performing his song \\"Only for Love\\" at a rock festival in Tokyo; Moroder suggested that Limahl sing the movie's title song. ==Music== With the exception of \\"The NeverEnding Story\\", Limahl composed the lyrics and music for the album himself. The original release was produced by Dave Harris and Tim Palmer; Palmer had previously collaborated with Kajagoogoo. \\"The NeverEnding Story\\" had lyrics by Keith Forsey and was produced by Moroder. In a 1984 Japanese television interview, Limahl said that Don't Suppose saw him experimenting much more than he did on White Feathers, Kajagoogoo's debut album (which included \\"Too Shy\\"). Much of the record features a string section; flutes and saxophones also join Limahl's keyboards. ==Title== Limahl explained that the title, Don't Suppose, was an invitation to the listener to personally verify the value of his music, without supposing, assuming, or guessing. ==Commercial performance== The album was moderately successful, although it was a commercial failure in the UK where it peaked at number 63 (much lower than Kajagoogoo's second album, released that same year, which peaked at number 35). In the US it did better, reaching No. 41. ==Singles== The song \\"Only for Love\\", the first single released from the album, peaked at number 16 on the UK Singles Chart in late 1983. The B-side of the single, \\"O.T.T. (Over The Top)\\", was never released on an album; it was a studio version of \\"Over the Top\\", an a cappella track partially sung by Limahl with Nick Beggs during the concert filmed for the VHS and Laserdisc release of Kajagoogoo's White Feathers Tour. The original live version included only the first two verses; the single includes a third verse, a middle section, and a final chorus with a brief coda. \\"Too Much Trouble\\" was the second release, though this failed to reach the UK Top 40. The third single, \\"The NeverEnding Story\\", charted in 17 countries, reaching the top 5 in several and number one in Spain, Sweden and Norway. In Italy and Germany, the song reached the number-two position. In the US the song only reached number 17 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In France and other French-speaking countries, \\"The NeverEnding Story (L'histoire sans fin)\\", a French version of the song also sung by Limahl, was released instead. The fourth single, \\"Tar Beach\\", was released only in Germany, with \\"The Greenhouse Effect (Live)\\" as its B-side. {  + Peak Chart Positions !

In 2014, Parlophone reissued it in Warner Music's budget boxed set Original Album Series along with Colour All My Days and the three Kajagoogoo albums without bonus material. The first eight tracks were digitised by Dutch budget label Disky Communications for inclusion on the compilation album The Best of Limahl, released in 1996. That album omits the last two tracks of Don't Suppose: \\"Tar Beach\\" and \\"Oh Girl\\"; also missing is \\"The Greenhouse Effect\\", although \\"The NeverEnding Story\\" is included. The compilation was re-released in 2003. In 2002, Disky released a reduced version of the compilation, Neverending Story—Best of Limahl, which included five songs from Don't Suppose. ==Track listingRelease details== {  ! Country ! Date !

This is perceived as puzzling in the context of the hypothesis that the expected future change in the exchange rate between two countries is equal to the interest-rate differential between these two countries; this hypothesis suggests that if all currencies are equally risky, investors would demand higher interest rates on currencies expected to fall in value. See: Forward exchange rate# Unbiasedness hypothesis. Thus, appreciation of the domestic currency when domestic interest rates are greater than foreign interest rates is called an anomaly. ==ReferencesSee also== *Economic puzzle *Real exchange-rate puzzles *Equity premium puzzle *Peso problem (finance) Category:Foreign exchange market Category:International macroeconomics Category:Economic puzzles ","title":"Forward premium anomaly"},{"id":"19285394","text":"Hackmans Gate is a hamlet in the parish of Broome, and the district of Wyre Forest District of Worcestershire, England.

It was owned by Edison International. On December 17, 2012, EME filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy with a proposal to transfer control of the company to holders of $3.7 billion in unsecured bonds. The reorganization plan was approved in March 2014 by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Under the reorganization plan, Edison Mission Energy would have remained a subsidiary of Edison International, but a new trust, under the control of the former bond-holders, would contain almost all of the former assets and liabilities of EME. NRG Energy acquired all of the assets of Edison Mission Energy in 2014 for $2.64 billion with approval from the U.S. bankruptcy court, following agreement among EME, Edison International and certain EME creditors. At that time, EME’s portfolio included 1,700 MW of wind power; 1,600 MW of gas-fired capacity; 4,300 MW of coal-fired capacity, and 400 MW of oil and waste coal-fired capacity. ==External links== * ==References== Category:Electric power companies of the United States ","title":"Edison Mission Energy"},{"id":"19285417","text":"Ewerton Teixeira (born February 13, 1982) is a Brazilian professional kickboxer, mixed martial artist, and Kyokushin Kaikan karateka. Teixeira obtained his first K-1 title in 2008 at K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 in Fukuoka by beating Keijiro Maeda in the final. He is training K-1 at the Ichigeki Academy Kyokushin Kaikan in Tokyo, Japan. Despite the short career for a kickboxer, Teixeira has notable wins against K-1 legends: Jerome Le Banner, Errol Zimmerman and Musashi. ==Career== After becoming the ninth Kyokushin World Champion in 2007, Teixeira entered K-1 in 2008. His first K-1 fight was against Japanese fan-favourite Yusuke Fujimoto. He won the fight by right cross KO. Teixeira then won the 2008 Japan GP after knocking out Tsutomu Takahagi in the first round followed by two unanimous decision wins over Tsuyoshi Nakasako and Keijiro Maeda. He was then placed in the 2008 WGP eliminations against Japanese veteran Musashi. He won by unanimous decision and qualified for his first World Grand Prix championships. In the quarter finals he fought his first non-Japanese opponent, Errol Zimmerman. Teixeira surprised the world by beating Zimmerman throughout the fight until he was dropped in the third round and ended up losing the fight by decision. In Yokohama in March 2009 he beat Jerome Lebanner by decision in the 5th round. At the Final 16, despite being a big favourite and promising a KO against the new Asia champion, Sing Jaideep, he won a decision in the 5th round. In the finals he was knocked out by Alistair Overeem in round 1 after a knee to the chin. In 2010 Teixeira fought K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 in Canberra as a super fight winning by KO over Alex Roberts. He then fought in K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 in Seoul Final 16 against Mr K-1 Peter Aerts losing a close bout in the extra round extension. The fight provided a defining moment to fans, finally proving that the Kyokushin fighter belonged in K-1. Teixeira ended 2010 at the K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 Final as the Reserve match and once again surprised everyone by out classing Errol Zimmerman for a judges unanimous decision. Texeira was waiting for engagement in K-1, but since there were no offers he decided to move to MMA, training with former UFC Heavyweight champion Junior dos Santos. He made his MMA debout on 23. Jun 2012, winning the fight via KO in round 3. Texeira said that he still wants to fight in K-1 if some bigger organisation offers the contract, but until then, he plans to fight under MMA rules. He lost to Hesdy Gerges by unanimous decision at Glory 13: Tokyo - Welterweight World Championship Tournament in Tokyo, Japan on December 21, 2013. ==Titles and accomplishments== *Kickboxing **2008 K-1 World GP in Fukuoka champion (defeated Keijiro Maeda in Final) *Kyokushin **2011 Silver2nd Place - 10th Kyokushin World Open Karate Tournament IKO 1 (Lost to Tariel Nikosheivili) **2011 5th Place - All American Open Karate Championships (Lost to Shouki Arata) **2007 Gold 9th Kyokushin World Open Karate Tournament IKO 1 (Defeated Jan Soukup) **2007 Gold All American Open Karate Championships (Defeated Andrews Nakahara) **2006 Silver All American Open Karate Championships (Lost to Andrews Nakahara) **2005 Gold 3rd Kyokushin World Weight Tournament Heavyweight (Defeated Lechi Kurbanov) **2004 Gold All American Open Karate Championships (Defeated Eduardo Tanaka) **2003 Bronze 8th Kyokushin World Open Karate Tournament IKO 1(Lost to Hitoshi Kiyama/Defeated Glaube Feitosa) **2003 Gold All American Open Karate Championships (Defeated Sergey Osipov) **2002 Gold All American Open Karate Championships (Defeated Lechi Kurbanov) **2002 Gold 2nd World Team Cup (Defeats Russia) **2001 Gold All American Open Karate Championships (Defeated Kentaro Tanaka) **2001 Silver Brazilian Open (Lost to Ulysses Isobe) **2001 Silver 2nd Kyokushin World Weight Tournament Heavyweight final 16 **2000 Gold Paulista Championships **2000 Brazilian Open Final 16 ==Kickboxing record== { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"width:90%; clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; font- size:85%; text-align:center;\\" - ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"background:darkGrey;\\" Kickboxing Record - valign=\\"top\\"  11 Wins (3 (T) KO's, 8 decisions), 4 Losses {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#ddd;\\"  Date  Result  Opponent  Event  Location  Method  Round  Time Record - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#fbb;\\"  2013-12-21  Loss align=left Hesdy Gerges  Glory 13: Tokyo  Tokyo, Japan  Decision (Unanimous)  3  3:00  11-4 - style=\\"text- align:center; background:#cfc;\\"  2010-12-11  Win align=left Errol Zimmerman  K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 Final  Tokyo, Japan  Decision (Unanimous)  3  3:00 11-3 - style=\\"text-align:center; background:#fbb;\\"  2010-10-02  Loss align=left Peter Aerts  K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 in Seoul Final 16  Seoul, Republic of Korea  Ext R.

The album was released September 16, 2008 on Capitol Nashville Records and produced by Frank Rogers. Learn to Live was Rucker's first studio album marketed towards country music, and is also his first release since the 2002 R&B; release of Back to Then. The album spawned three number one singles on the Billboard country music chart: \\"Don't Think I Don't Think About It,\\" \\"It Won't Be Like This for Long,\\" and \\"Alright.\\" Learn to Live is Rucker's best-selling solo album to date, and is his only solo album to go Platinum. == Background == Learn to Live was recorded both in Franklin, Tennessee, and Nashville, Tennessee. Brady Vercher of Engine 145 praised the album's overall production and sound, finding nearly every track to, \\"sound as if it were crafted to be a potential single, with solid hooks and melodies aplenty, but at times the phrasing is more focused on selling those aspects at the expense of emotion.\\" Slant Magazine's Johnathan Keefe praised the album's production, saying that the record makes, \\"a concerted effort to sound like a modern country album.\\" He also gave credit to the album's producer, Frank Rogers (who had previously produced Brad Paisley's albums), who had co-written most of the album's twelve tracks. Many of the tracks are a variety of country music styles. The second track, \\"All I Want\\" is set in a two-step shuffle, while \\"Drinkin' and Dialin'\\" is a \\"clever barroom crawl,\\" according to Allmusic. \\"All I Want\\" features guitar played by Brad Paisley and its fifth track, \\"If I Had Wings,\\" features harmony vocals from country artists Vince Gill and Alison Krauss. == Critical reception == Learn to Live received a score of 66 out of 100 from Metacritic based on \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Blake Boldt of PopMatters gave the album overall solid review, praising the single, \\"Don't Think I Don't Think About It,\\" by calling Rucker's delivery, \\"honest and heartfelt.\\" Boldt was also pleased with the fact that Rucker attracted, \\"the attention of the country radio audience with that single, and it’s helped boost the profile of his first full country album, Learn to Live, a release that owns a variety of country music’s common topics and musical techniques.\\" Boldt concluded his review by saying, \\"Learn to Live is well- produced and well-sung, but too many of the songs fail to fit the artist behind them.\\" Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe also praised Learn to Live, calling the single, \\"Alright,\\" an \\"essential\\" track. Rodman later stated, \\"If you're going to be tooling down the middle of the road, \\"Learn to Live\\" is perfectly pleasant accompaniment.\\" Learn to Live was also reviewed by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic, who gave the release three out of five stars. Like PopMatters, Erlewine was pleased that Rucker chose to make a \\"leap\\" into country music. Erlewine frequently compared the album to Hootie & the Blowfish's Cracked Rear View, saying that the material was, \\"written with Rucker in mind, not a jam band, they're more pop in form and feel than anything he's done since.\\" Erlewine then stated, \\"...these songs aren't knockouts, but they're friendly and comfortable, the kind of sturdy roots-pop that seems like it'd be easy to pull off but must not be, as this delicate balance of conversational melody and guy-next-door appeal has proven elusive to Rucker for over a decade now.\\" The New York Times favored the album as well. Critic, Jon Caramanica found Rucker to be \\"well-suited\\" to country music and called the tracks, \\"impressively eclectic and sharply written.\\" He compared \\"Alright\\" to that of the recent hits by country singer, Craig Morgan, and then concluded by saying, \\"Such missteps [the song \\"If I Had Wings\\"] are few, though, and “Learn to Live” is seamless enough that it almost slips by unnoticed that Mr. Rucker is the first African-American to have a Top 10 country hit (the muscular “Don’t Think I Don’t Think About It”) since Charley Pride.\\" == Commercial performance == The album's lead single, \\"Don't Think I Don't Think About It\\" was released May 27, 2008. The song became Rucker's first number one single by September 2008, becoming the first African-American country artist to have a major hit since Charley Pride in the 1980s. Learn to Live debuted at #1 on the Billboard Country Albums chart and at #5 on the overall Billboard 200, selling 60,000 copies in its first week. As of February 2010, the album has sold 1,298,274 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and has now been certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, for shipments to retailers of a million copies. After releasing the album's second single in late 2008 entitled, \\"It Won't Be Like This for Long,\\" the song became his second number one single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The album's seventh track entitled, \\"Alright,\\" was released as a single shortly afterward. The song became Rucker's third number one single on the Billboard country chart, spending two weeks at #1 in early August. On September 8, 2009, the album's fourth and final single, \\"History in the Making,\\" was released, debuting at #51 on the Billboard country chart, and went on to be an additional Top Five hit. == Track listing Personnel== *David Angell – violin *Manisa Angell – violin *Ron Block – banjo *Mike Brignardello – bass guitar *Jim \\"Moose\\" Brown – piano, Wurlitzer *Pat Buchanan – electric guitar, acoustic guitar, baritone guitar, mandolin *Bradley Clark – background vocals *J.

The film also depicts the love triangle between the Admiral, his wife, and the poet Anna Timiryova. An extended version of the movie was made into a 10-part TV mini-series which was shown by Channel One in 2009. == Plot == During the production of War and Peace at Mosfilm Studios in 1964, an elderly Russian noblewoman is set to appear as an extra until her past comes to light. Although the film's political commissar demands her dismissal since she is a \\"wife of an enemy of the revolution,\\" director Sergei Bondarchuk is adamant that he needs faces like hers for the production. The film flashes back to the Baltic Sea in 1916. Captain Alexander Kolchak (Konstantin Khabenskiy) is laying naval mines from his ship in German territorial waters when he runs across , an armoured cruiser of the German Imperial Navy. As chaos reigns on his ship, Kolchak succeeds in seriously damaging the bridge of the German vessel. Realizing that the enemy ship is blocking his line of escape, Kolchak informs his men that the only way to return to safety is to lure the Germans onto one of his mines. As the ship steams into the mines they have just laid, Kolchak leads his men in Russian Orthodox prayers for God's protection. Kolchak's vessel barely avoids hitting its own mines, while the German ship sinks. At the naval base in the Grand Duchy of Finland and now promoted to rear admiral, Kolchak is introduced to Anna Timireva (Elizaveta Boyarskaya), the wife of his subordinate officer and close friend Captain Sergei Timirev. The strong attraction between them immediately becomes apparent. Although Sergei reminds his wife that they took vows before God, Anna is unmoved and wants nothing more than to be with the Admiral. Terrified of losing Kolchak, his wife Sofya (Anna Kovalchuk) offers to leave for Petrograd and let him be with Anna. The Admiral firmly tells her, \\"You are my wife and I am your husband. That is how it always shall be.\\" His feelings for Anna continue to grow, and when she delivers a love letter to Kolchak, he informs her that they cannot ever meet again. When Anna demands to know why, the Admiral responds, \\"Because I love you.\\" Later, he is informed that Tsar Nicholas II (Nikolay Burlyaev) has promoted him to vice admiral, to be in command of the Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol. After receiving a last- minute letter from Kolchak, Anna rushes to the train station to see off her beloved. She is too late, however, and experiences only an uncomfortable look from Sofya. After the February Revolution in 1917, Tsarist officers are disarmed and summarily executed at the Kronstadt naval base. Sergei barely escapes the island with Anna. Meanwhile, a group of enlisted men arrive aboard Kolchak's flotilla in Sevastopol and demand that all officers surrender their arms. To avoid bloodshed, Kolchak orders his subordinates to obey and throws his own sword into the harbor. Later, Kolchak is summoned to Petrograd by Alexander Kerensky (Viktor Verzhbitskiy), who offers to appoint him Minister of Defense. Kolchak, however, sharply criticizes Kerensky for promoting indiscipline in both the Russian Army and Navy. He will only accept if he is given a free hand to restore old practices. Kerensky, enraged by Kolchak's \\"counterrevolutionary sympathies\\", offers him exile in the United States, on the reason that the Allies need him as an expert to take Constantinople\\" by naval attack. Kolchak accepts, seeing no future for himself and his family in Russia. Shortly after, his wife and son are rescued from their home in the Crimea and whisked away to a British ship, just before the house is attacked by a bunch of local red guards. In the late summer of 1918, almost two years after the October Revolution, Anna and Sergei Timiriov are travelling on the Trans-Siberian Railway when she learns Kolchak has returned and is setting up an army in Omsk, western Siberia. Sergei is dismayed when Anna announces that she is leaving him. After commenting about what a year of Revolution it has been, Sergei helps Anna to pack her things. After hearing Kolchak's speeches to his troops about defeating the Bolsheviks and \\"restoring Russia\\", Anna is deeply moved and goes to work as a nurse helping the wounded of the Russian Civil War. Some time later, Kolchak is informed that the Red Army is advancing on Omsk, assisted by sympathizers behind White lines. Although his advisers all suggest defending Omsk to the last, Kolchak decrees that they will instead evacuate and seize Irkutsk as the new capital of anti-communist Russia. During the evacuation, Anna is recognized by a White officer who informs Kolchak. Deeply moved, the Admiral goes to her and announces that, although he made the mistake of leaving her once, he will never do so again. As the train steams toward Irkutsk, Kolchak informs Anna that he has written to his wife Sofya to formally asked for a divorce. Although he asks Anna to marry him, she insists that there is no need of marriage and that what matters is that they are together now. Eventually, she relents and they are seen attending the Divine Liturgy together. Meanwhile, Irkutsk is under the nominal control of the French General Maurice Janin and the Czechoslovak Legion. With their defenses disintegrating, the Red Army offers them only one way out alive. As a result, General Janin agrees to hand over Admiral Kolchak. Kolchak's ally General Vladimir Kappel, meanwhile, leads an army to relieve Irkutsk. Due to a navigation error and pressed by time, Kappel and his troops try cutting across a frozen river; however, he falls through the ice and injures himself. Kolchak is placed under arrest by the Czechoslovaks and handed over to the Reds. Despite Kolchak's attempts to shield her, Anna insists that, as his wife, she must be arrested, too. Kappel's army eventually reaches the outskirts of Irkutsk just in time to rescue Kolchak, but fails. Kolchak is given a cursory trial by the Irkutsk soviet and executed with his former Prime Minister by a firing squad along the banks of the frozen Angara River. His last words are, \\"Send word to my wife in Paris that I bless our son\\". Their bodies are then dumped into an opening in the ice, hewn up by the local Orthodox clergy for the Great Blessing of Waters on Theophany. The film then returns to the present, 44 years later at the Mosfilm Studios. It is revealed that Anna—now in her 70s and identified as the elderly noblewoman—survived more than 30 years in the Gulag and was only released during the Khrushchev thaw. As Anna Timiorova witnesses a rehearsal for one of the ballroom scenes from War and Peace, she accidentally bumps into an actor, breaking a glass of wine, which reminds her of first meeting Kolchak, and her dreams of the formal dance she was never able to share with her beloved. === Epilogue === The fates of the film's main characters are revealed in an epilogue: * Anna Vasilyevna Timiryova was arrested numerous times following Admiral Kolchak's execution and survived nearly 40 years in the Gulag before her release in 1960. She died in Moscow in January 1975, aged 81. * Anna's former husband, Sergei Timirev, became a rear admiral commanding the White Russian Navy in Siberia before fleeing to China, where he captained Chinese steamers.

However, he keeps on struggling, he preserves his honour and his dignity, and he continues to love.\\" Actress Elizaveta Boyarskaya said of her character, \\"She was a woman of such force, of such will, with such magnanimity... I feel an amazing resemblance to her... When I read script, I was even a bit scared: because she has the same vision of history as me. All that can arrive at is me. And when I played Anna, I did not play, I was her. It is my epoch, my attitude regarding love.\\" After being asked about the film Doctor Zhivago, she stated, \\"The only thing that these two films share consists in the love which the Russian women can carry; it is a topic approached by many novels. They love up to the last drop of blood, till the most dreadful end, to the death; they are capable of leaving family and children for the love of the man which they have chosen.\\" == Production == The film had 210 shooting days. Work on the picture took four years. Principal photography lasted for a year-and-half with a two to three-month break. Locations included Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Sevastopol, Torzhok and Irkutsk. The twelve-minute battle scene took a month to shoot. Twenty-four thousand CGI shots were incorporated into the film. Khabensky had to wear an orthopedic corset due to poor posture. == Release and reception == The first screening of the film took place on October 9, 2008. Reception of the movie by Russian critics was mixed. Because Kolchak had been portrayed as a villain in Soviet historiography, the film encountered some controversy in Russia due to its reversal of roles. In the United States, Leslie Felperin of Variety wrote: \\"Strictly as a film, however, Admiral is entertaining enough in a retro Doctor Zhivago/War and Peace sort of way, with its big setpieces, lavish costumes and string-laden orchestral score. For all intents and purposes, pic reps a virtual mirror image of those old patriotic Soviet-era movies wherein the Reds were the heroes and the White Army the baddies.\\" === Awards === * MTV Russia Movie Awards ** Best Film ** Best Male Actor (Konstantin Khabensky) ** Best Actress (Elizaveta Boyarskaya) ** Best Spectacular Scene *Golden Eagle Award ** Best Male Actor (Konstantin Khabensky) ** Best Cinematography ** Best Costumes ** Best Sound == Soundtrack == The main original song for the film, \\"Anna\\", is performed by Russian singer Victoria Dayneko and composed by Igor Matvienko. The poem itself was written by Anna Timireva in memory of the Admiral. \\"Vopreki\\" (\\"Despite\\") was written by Konstantin Meladze and performed by Valery Meladze. == References  External links == * Category:2008 films Category:Cultural depictions of Alexander Kolchak Category:Biographical films about military leaders Category:Russian historical films Category:Russian films Category:Russian biographical drama films Category:Films directed by Andrei Kravchuk Category:Russian Civil War films Category:World War I naval films Category:Films set in the Baltic Sea Category:Films set in Siberia Category:World War I films based on actual events Category:Films about Soviet repression Category:Russian Revolution films Category:World War I films set on the Eastern Front Category:Films set in 1916 Category:Films set in 1917 Category:Films set in 1918 Category:Films set in 1919 Category:Films set in 1920 Category:Films set in 1964 Category:Films shot in Crimea Category:Films shot in Moscow Oblast Category:Films shot in Saint Petersburg Category:Films shot in Siberia Category:Biographical action films Category:Period action films Category:Russian war films Category:War romance films Category:2008 biographical drama films Category:Channel One Russia original programming Category:2009 Russian television series debuts Category:2009 Russian television series endings Category:2000s Russian television series Category:Russian television miniseries Category:Cultural depictions of Nicholas II of Russia Category:2008 drama films ","title":"Admiral (2008 film)"},{"id":"19285466","text":"The 1985 Irish local elections were held in all the counties, cities and towns of Ireland on 20 June 1985. ==ResultsCounty, city and town council seats=== {  -  colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" valign=\\"top\\"  Party  valign=\\"top\\"  Seats  valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"center\\" ±  valign=\\"top\\"  First pref. votes  valign=\\"top\\"  % FPV The first two digits of the Fine Gael total vote seem to be transposed in error, based on the other figures and percentages.  valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"center\\" ±% -  align=\\"right\\" 441  align=\\"right\\"  113  align=\\"right\\" 648,070  align=\\"right\\" 45.6  align=\\"right\\" +6.5 -  align=\\"right\\" 287  align=\\"right\\"  5  align=\\"right\\" 422,045  align=\\"right\\" 29.7  align=\\"right\\" -5.4 -  align=\\"right\\" 60  align=\\"right\\"  15  align=\\"right\\" 109,681  align=\\"right\\" 7.9  align=\\"right\\" -4.2 -  align=\\"right\\" 20  align=\\"right\\" 13  align=\\"right\\" 43,006  align=\\"right\\" 3.0  align=\\"right\\" +0.8 -  align=\\"right\\" 10  align=\\"right\\"  0  align=\\"right\\" 46,391  align=\\"right\\" 3.3  align=\\"right\\"  -  align=\\"right\\"  6  align=\\"right\\"  2  align=\\"right\\"  11073  align=\\"right\\"  0.8  align=\\"right\\"  -  align=\\"right\\" 3  align=\\"right\\" New  align=\\"right\\" 5,472  align=\\"right\\" 0.4  align=\\"right\\" New -  align=\\"right\\" 1  align=\\"right\\" New  align=\\"right\\" 1,681  align=\\"right\\" 0.1  align=\\"right\\" New -  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\" New  align=\\"right\\" 7,446  align=\\"right\\" 0.5  align=\\"right\\" New -  align=\\"right\\" 0  align=\\"right\\"   align=\\"right\\" 593  align=\\"right\\" 0.0  align=\\"right\\"  -  align=\\"right\\"   align=\\"right\\"   align=\\"right\\" 137,109  align=\\"right\\" 9.6  align=\\"right\\" -2.1 -  colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"1\\"  Total  align=\\"right\\"   align=\\"right\\"   align=\\"right\\" 1,421,494  align=\\"right\\" 100  align=\\"right\\" — } : \\"Waterford People's Party\\" was a local splinter from the Worker's Party.

Duke, and Barney B. Roberts, \\"Mars Exploration Strategies: A Reference Design Mission,\\" International Astronautical Congress 1993, Paper IAF-93-Q.1.383 (1993) was a NASA study completed in May 1993, under the auspices of the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI).Design Reference Mission 1 , Encyclopedia Astronautica (accessed 29 Sept 2015) The objectiveDouglas R. Cooke, An Overview of Recent Coordinated Human Exploration Studies, Advanced Development Office, NASA Johnson Space Center, January 2000 (accessed 30 Sept 2015) was to develop a \\"Reference Mission\\" based on previous studies and data, where the Reference Mission serves as a basis for comparing different approaches and criteria from future studies. The study was based on Robert Zubrin's Mars Direct mission design. Thus dubbed Mars Semi-Direct by Zubrin, it also made several significant changes, for instance accounting for a larger crew and a dedicated Mars Ascent Vehicle that was to do an Apollo-style Mars- orbit rendezvous with the Earth Return Vehicle, which was to remain in orbit. The Design Reference Mission replaced the preceding SEI as the standing mission plan. ===Approach and results=== * Limit the time that the crew is exposed to the harsh space environment by employing fast transits to and from Mars and abort to the surface strategy * Utilize local resources to reduce mission mass * Use split-mission strategy to pre-deploy mission hardware to reduce mass and minimize risk to the crew * Examine three human missions to Mars beginning in 2009 * Utilize advanced space propulsion (e.g., nuclear thermal propulsion) for in-space transportation * Payloads sent directly to Mars using a large launch vehicle (200+ t to LEO) * Nuclear surface power for robust continuous power The conclusions of the study were that the total mission mass was approximately 900 metric tons for the first crew (3 cargo vehicles, 1 piloted vehicle). The study pointed out that development of the large launch vehicle is a long-lead and expensive system, and approaches using smaller launch vehicles should be investigated. ==Design Reference Mission 2.0== In 1997 a NASA Mars Exploration Study Team was put together and made a more detailed version of the original design reference mission. The plan describes the first human missions to Mars with concept of operations and technologies to be used as a first cut at an architecture.

The stated purpose of the Reference Mission was to stimulate further thought and development of alternative approaches: \\"It is intended to identify and clarify system \\"drivers\\", or significant sources of cost, performance, risk, and schedule variation. It does not represent a final or recommended approach to human Mars missions. Several alternative scenarios, including human exploration missions to the Moon, Asteroids, or other targets beyond Earth orbit as well as employing different technical approaches to solving mission and technology challenges, are currently under study by the Exploration Team. Comparing alternative approaches provides the basis for continual improvement to technology investment plans and general understanding of future human exploration missions. The Addendum represents a \\"snapshot\\" of work in progress in support of planning for future human exploration missions through May 1998. The report of the Reference Mission Version 3.0 states: > From the work of the original Reference Mission (Version 1.0), the strategy > for the human exploration of Mars has evolved from its original form to one > of reduced system mass, use of a smaller, more reasonable launch vehicle, > and use of more current technology.

The random sampled particles can be used to approximate the probability density function of the continuous random variable if the value M\\\\rightarrow\\\\infin. The empirical prediction density is produced as the weighted summation of these particles: \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_t)=\\\\sum_{j=1}^Mf(\\\\alpha_{t+1}\\\\alpha_t^j)\\\\pi_t^j, and we can view it as the \\"prior\\" density. Note that the particles are assumed to have the same weight \\\\pi_t^j=\\\\frac{1}{M}. Combining the prior density \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_t) and the likelihood f(y_{t+1}\\\\alpha_{t+1}), the empirical filtering density can be produced as: \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_{t+1})=\\\\frac {f(y_{t+1}\\\\alpha_{t+1}) \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_t)}{f(y_{t+1}Y_t)} \\\\propto f(y_{t+1}\\\\alpha_{t+1}) \\\\sum_{j=1}^Mf(\\\\alpha_{t+1}\\\\alpha_t^j)\\\\pi_t^j, where f(y_{t+1}Y_t) =\\\\int f(y_{t+1}\\\\alpha_{t+1})dF(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_t). On the other hand, the true filtering density which we want to estimate is f(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_{t+1})=\\\\frac{f(y_{t+1}\\\\alpha_{t+1})f(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_t)}{f(y_{t+1}Y_t)}. The prior density \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_t) can be used to approximate the true filtering density f(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_{t+1}): * The particle filters draw R samples from the prior density \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_t). Each sample are drawn with equal probability. *Assign each sample with the weights \\\\pi_j=\\\\frac{\\\\omega_j}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^R\\\\omega_i},\\\\omega_j=f(y\\\\alpha^j). The weights represent the likelihood function f(y_{t+1}\\\\alpha_{t+1}). * If the number R\\\\rightarrow\\\\infin, than the samples converge to the desired true filtering density. *The R particles are resampled to M particles with the weight \\\\pi_j. The weakness of the particle filters includes: * If the weight {\\\\omega_j} has a large variance, the sample amount R must be large enough for the samples to approximate the empirical filtering density. In other words, while the weight is widely distributed, the SIR method will be imprecise and the adaption is difficult. Therefore, the auxiliary particle filter is proposed to solve this problem. == Auxiliary particle filter  Auxiliary variable === Comparing with the empirical filtering density which has \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_{t+1})\\\\propto f(y_{t+1}\\\\alpha_{t+1}) \\\\sum_{j=1}^Mf(\\\\alpha_{t+1}\\\\alpha_t^j)\\\\pi_t^j, we now define \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\alpha_{t+1},kY_{t+1})\\\\propto f(y_{t+1}\\\\alpha_{t+1}) f(\\\\alpha_{t+1}\\\\alpha_t^k)\\\\pi^k, where k=1,...,M. Being aware that \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_{t+1}) is formed by the summation of M particles, the auxiliary variable k represents one specific particle. With the aid of k, we can form a set of samples which has the distribution g(\\\\alpha_{t+1},kY_{t+1}). Then, we draw from these sample set g(\\\\alpha_{t+1},kY_{t+1}) instead of directly from \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_{t+1}). In other words, the samples are drawn from \\\\widehat{f}(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_{t+1}) with different probability. The samples are ultimately utilized to approximate f(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_{t+1}). Take the SIR method for example: *The particle filters draw R samples from g(\\\\alpha_{t+1},kY_{t+1}). *Assign each samples with the weight \\\\pi_j=\\\\frac{\\\\omega_j}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^R\\\\omega_i}, \\\\omega_j=\\\\frac{f(y_{t+1}\\\\alpha_{t+1}^j)f(\\\\alpha_{t+1}^j\\\\alpha_t^k)}{g(\\\\alpha_{t+1}^j,k^jY_{t+1})}. *By controlling y_{t+1} and \\\\alpha_t^k, the weights are adjusted to be even. *Similarly, the R particles are resampled to M particles with the weight \\\\pi_j. The original particle filters draw samples from the prior density, while the auxiliary filters draw from the joint distribution of the prior density and the likelihood. In other words, the auxiliary particle filters avoid the circumstance which the particles are generated in the regions with low likelihood. As a result, the samples can approximate f(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_{t+1}) more precisely. === Selection of the auxiliary variable === The selection of the auxiliary variable affects g(\\\\alpha_{t+1},kY_{t+1}) and controls the distribution of the samples. A possible selection of g(\\\\alpha_{t+1},kY_{t+1}) can be: g(\\\\alpha_{t+1},kY_{t+1})\\\\propto f(y_{t+1}\\\\mu_{t+1}^k) f(\\\\alpha_{t+1}\\\\alpha_t^k)\\\\pi^k, where k=1,...,M and \\\\mu_{t+1}^k is the mean. We sample from g(\\\\alpha_{t+1},kY_{t+1}) to approximate f(\\\\alpha_{t+1}Y_{t+1}) by the following procedure: * First, we assign probabilities to the indexes of f(\\\\alpha_{t+1}\\\\alpha_t^k). We named these probabilities as the first-stage weights \\\\lambda_k, which are proportional to g(kY_{t+1})\\\\propto \\\\pi^kf(y_{t+1}\\\\mu_{t+1}^k). * Then, we draw R samples from f(\\\\alpha_{t+1}\\\\alpha_t^k) with the weighted indexes. By doing so, we are actually drawing the samples from g(\\\\alpha_{t+1},kY_{t+1}). * Moreover, we reassign the second-stage weights \\\\pi_j=\\\\frac{\\\\omega_j}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^R\\\\omega_i} as the probabilities of the R samples, where \\\\omega_j=\\\\frac{f(y_{t+1}\\\\alpha_{t+1}^j)}{f(y_{t+1}\\\\mu_{t+1}^j)}. The weights are aim to compensate the effect of \\\\mu_{t+1}^k. * Finally, the R particles are resampled to M particles with the weights \\\\pi_j. Following the procedure, we draw the R samples from g(\\\\alpha_{t+1},kY_{t+1}). Since g(\\\\alpha_{t+1},kY_{t+1}) is closely related to the mean \\\\mu_{t+1}^k, it has high conditional likelihood. As a result, the sampling procedure is more efficient and the value R can be reduced. === Other point of view === Assume that the filtered posterior is described by the following M weighted samples: : p(x_tz_{1:t}) \\\\approx \\\\sum_{i=1}^M \\\\omega^{(i)}_t \\\\delta \\\\left( x_t - x^{(i)}_t \\\\right). Then, each step in the algorithm consists of first drawing a sample of the particle index k which will be propagated from t-1 into the new step t. These indexes are auxiliary variables only used as an intermediary step, hence the name of the algorithm.

Millions of pilgrims visit the temple every year. Acharya Kishore Kunal is the secretary of the Mahavir Mandir Temple Trust, Patna. ==Philanthropic work by Shri Mahavir Sthan Nyas Samiti== Mahavir Mandir Trust is named Shri Mahavir Sthan Nyas Samiti(श्री महावीरस्थान न्यास समीती). Headed by Aacharya Kishore Kunal, the trust monitors working and development of temple. The Trusts uses the temple fund to run human welfare organizations and hospitals like Mahavir Cancer Institute & Research Centre, Mahavir Vaatsalya Hospital and Mahavir Arogya Hospital and other several hospitals and orphanage in the agricultural and rural state of Bihar. The Mahavir Mandir Trusts have the second highest budget in North India after the famous Maa Vaishno Devi shrine. ==Dalit Priest== On 13 June 1993, Suryavanshi Das, a person from dalit community, became priest of the temple, the decision taken by Acharya Kishore Kunal received support from three well known priests—Ramchandra Paramahans, Mahant Avaidyanath of Baba Gorakhnath Dham and Mahant Avadh Kishore Das. ==History== As per the Patna High Court judgment in 1948 the temple exists since time immemorial. But from the scrutiny of historical facts and traditions it appears that this temple was originally established by Swami Balanand, an ascetic of Ramanandi sect in around 1730 A.D. This temple gained popularity in 1947 with large number of Hindu refugees coming to Patna after the partition of India. Subsequently, temple was rebuilt as a concrete house at same time. Even this was broken down in 1987 to make a huge marble temple. The idol of Sankat-Mochan stands in it. ==Visits== Long winding queues can be seen at the temple on Saturdays and Tuesdays, the traditional worshiping days of Lord Hanuman. Thousands of people visit Mahavir Mandir on every Ram Navami and New Year celebration. On every Ram Navami waiting queues grow up to some kilometer long.

With a modular product architecture, companies can offer a wide range of products and services without increasing complexity, since modules and module variants, like blocks of LEGO, can be configured in many different ways. The MFD method ensures that each module has functional, strategic and customer-centric value and can be combined with other modules through standardized interfaces. A modular product architecture can enable mass customization, where customers configure and order personalized - rather than ready-made - products and services. ==Five Steps== MFD consists of five steps: 1\\\\.

Griffon is intended to be a high-productivity framework by rewarding use of the Model-View-Controller paradigm, providing a stand-alone development environment and hiding much of the configuration detail from the developer. The first release is the fruit of the effort by the Groovy Swing team and an attempt to take the best of rapid application development, as indicated by its Grails-like structure, the agility of Groovy, and the availability of components for Swing. The framework was redesign from scratch for version 2, allowing different JVM programming languages to be used either in isolation or in conjunction. Supported UI toolkits are * Java Swing * JavaFX * Apache Pivot * Lanterna == Overview == Griffon aims to reduce the typical confusion that occurs with traditional Java UI development. Due to the MVC structure of Griffon, developers never have to go searching for files or be confused on how to start a new project. Everything begins with: lazybones create The generated project follows this structure: %PROJECT_HOME% + griffon-app + conf ---> location of configuration artifacts like builder configuration + controllers ---> location of controller classes + i18n ---> location of message bundles for i18n + lifecycle ---> location of lifecycle scripts + models ---> location of model classes + resources ---> location of non code resources (images, etc) + views ---> location of view classes + src + main ---> optional; location for Groovy and Java source files (of types other than those in griffon-app/*) The builder infrastructure enables seamless integration of different widget libraries such as Swing, JIDE, and SwingX. In the first release, three sample applications are included : * Greet, a Groovy Twitter client featured in the JavaOne 2009 Script Bowl, * FontPicker, an application to view the available fonts on one's machine, * SwingPad, a lightweight designer application for Griffon user interfaces. == Plugins == Griffon can be extended with the use of plugins. Plugins provide run-time access to testing libraries such as Easyb and FEST, and all widget libraries besides core Swing are provided as plugins. The plugin system allows for a wide range of additions, for example * Polyglot Programming with Java, Apache Groovy, Kotlin. * SQL and NoSQL datastores like Berkleydb, CouchDB, Db4O, Neo4j, NeoDatis, Memcached and Riak. == Publications  Books === Features that would eventually become integral parts of Griffon (UI builders) were featured in these books: * Groovy In Action (published by Manning) * Beginning Groovy and Grails Books that cover Griffon: * Griffon In Action (published by Manning) * Beginning Groovy, Grails and Griffon === Magazine === * GroovyMag for Groovy and Grails developers == See also == *Agile software development == References == * Article by Guillaume Laforge (Project Lead of the Groovy Language) : Griffon shows its claws: Grails-like rich Swing client framework released * Articles by the Griffon team : Griffon and Greet: Starting to get Groovy Revisiting the hidden threading rule, Griffon takes flight, Awakening the Griffon * Article by a technical writer in the NetBeans Docs team at Sun Microsystems: Notes on Converting NetBeans Grails Support to NetBeans Griffon Support, The 5 Best Things About Griffon , Griffon: Identifying the Dark Underbelly of Java ==External links== * Griffon Home Page Category:Computer programming tools Category:Java platform ","title":"Griffon (framework)"},{"id":"19285694","text":"Sool is a 2008 album released by German electronic musician Ellen Allien, released on her BPitch Control music label.

He was educated in the local school. In 1639 he moved to Halle and completed his education there. From 1645 he studied Philosophy at the University of Wittenberg. In 1657 he became extraordinary professor, and in 1662 ordinary professor at University of Wittenberg, replacing Johannes Meisner. During the Syncretistic Controversy and Pietistic controversy he represented the extreme orthodox Lutheranism; and opposed especially the younger Calixtus and the theology of the Pietists. Against Spener, the leader of the Pietists, he charged no less than 263 heresies. To his scientific interests belonged the development of the so-called Theologia paradisiaca, i.e., that Adam, the patriarchs, and the whole Old Testament agreed with the Augsburg Confession and Formulas of Concord. To prove this, he published an Antiquissima theologia positiva primi theologi Adami, a Symbolum apostolicum Adami; and Der christlutherischen Kirche Prediger-Beicht and Beichtstuhl von dem grossen Jehova-Elohim im Paradiese gestiftet.

The reason for the large number of teams being relegated was due to the league being restructured the next season from 16 to 12 teams as the new RFU Championship was introduced. == Participating teams == { class=\\" sortable\\" - !width=25%Team !width=25%Stadium !width=25%Capacity !width=25%City/Area - Bedford Blues Goldington Road 6,000 Bedford, Bedfordshire - - Cornish Pirates Recreation Ground 9,000 Camborne, Cornwall - - Coventry Butts Park Arena 4,000 Coventry, West Midlands - - Doncaster Knights Castle Park 3,075 Doncaster, South Yorkshire - - Esher Molesey Road 3,000 Hersham, Surrey - - Exeter Chiefs Sandy Park 8,000 Exeter, Devon - - Leeds Carnegie Headingley Stadium 22,250 Leeds, West Yorkshire - - London Welsh Old Deer Park 5,850 Richmond, London - - Manchester Grove Park 4,000 Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester - - Moseley Billesley Common 3,000+ Birmingham, West Midlands - - Newbury Monk's Lane 8,000 Newbury, Berkshire - - Nottingham Meadow Lane 19,588 Nottingham, Nottinghamshire - - Otley Cross Green 5,000 Otley, West Yorkshire - - Plymouth Albion The Brickfields 6,500 Plymouth, Devon - - Rotherham Titans Clifton Lane 2,500 Rotherham, South Yorkshire - - Sedgley Park Park Lane 3,000 Whitefield, Greater Manchester - } ;Notes ==TableNotes=== Points were awarded as follows: * 4 points for a win * 2 points for a draw * 0 points for a loss * 1 bonus point (BP) for losing by 7 points or less * 1 bonus point (BT) for scoring 4 tries or more in a match == Results  Round 1 === \\\\---- === Round 2 === \\\\---- === Round 3 === \\\\---- === Round 4 === \\\\---- === Round 5 === \\\\---- === Round 6 === \\\\---- === Round 7 === \\\\---- === Round 8 === \\\\---- === Round 9 === \\\\---- === Round 10 === \\\\---- === Round 11 === \\\\---- === Round 12 === \\\\---- === Round 13 === \\\\---- === Round 14 === \\\\---- === Round 15 === *Postponed.
