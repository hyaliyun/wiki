This structure can be used to efficiently implement some geometrical operations over zones, such as testing emptyness, inclusion, equality, and computing the intersection and the sum of two zones. It is, for example, used in the Uppaal model checker; where it is also distributed as an independent library.http://people.cs.aau.dk/~adavid/UDBM/index.html More precisely, there is a notion of canonical DBM; there is a one-to-one relation between canonical DBMs and zones and from each DBM a canonical equivalent DBM can be efficiently computed. Thus, equality of zone can be tested by checking for equality of canonical DBMs. == Zone == A difference bound matrix is used to represents some kind of convex polytopes. Those polytopes are called zone. They are now defined. Formally, a zone is defined by equations of the form x\\\\le c, x\\\\ge c, x_1\\\\le x_2+c and x_1\\\\ge x_2+c, with x_1 and x_2 some variables, and c a constant. Zones have originally be called region, but nowadays this name usually denote region, a special kind of zone. Intuitively, a region can be considered as a minimal non-empty zones, in which the constants used in constraint are bounded. Given n variables, there are exactly n(n+1) different non-redundant constraints possible, n constraints which use a single variable and an upper bound, n constraints which uses a single variable and a lower bound, and for each of the n^2 ordered pairs of variable (x,y), an upper bound on x-y. However, an arbitrary convex polytope in \\\\mathbb R^n may require an arbitrarily great number of constraints. Even when n=2, there can be an arbitrary great number of non-redundant constraints (x, for c_i some constants. This is the reason why DBMs can not be extended from zones to convex polytopes. == Example == As stated in the introduction, we consider a zone defined by a set of statements of the form x_1\\\\le c, x_1\\\\ge c, x_1\\\\le x_2+c and x_1\\\\ge x_2+c, with x_1 and x_2 some variables, and c a constant. However some of those constraints are either contradictory or redundant. We now give such examples. * the constraints x_1\\\\le3 and x_1\\\\ge4 are contradictory. Hence, when two such constraints are found, the zone defined is empty. Figure in \\\\mathbb R^2 showing x_1\\\\le 3, x_1\\\\ge4 which are disjoint * the constraints x_1\\\\le3 and x_1\\\\le 4 are redundant. The second constraint being implied by the first one. Hence, when two such constraints are found in the definition of the zone, the second constraint may be removed. Figure in \\\\mathbb R^2 showing x_1\\\\le 3 and x_1\\\\le 4 which contains the first figure We also give example showing how to generate new constraints from existing constraints. For each pair of clocks x_1 and x_2, the DBM has a constraint of the form x_1\\\\prec x_2+c, where \\\\prec is either < or ≤. If no such constraint can be found, the constraint x_1\\\\prec x_2+\\\\infty can be added to the zone definition without loss of generality. But in some case, a more precise constraint can be found. Such an example is now going to be given. * the constraints x_1\\\\le 3, x_2\\\\ge-3 implies that x_1\\\\le x_2+6. Thus, assuming that no other constraint such as x_1\\\\le x_2+5 or x_1 belongs to the definition, the constraint x_1\\\\le x_2+6 is added to the zone definition. Figure in \\\\mathbb R^2 showing x_1\\\\le 3, x_2\\\\ge-3 and their intersections * the constraints x_2\\\\le 3, x_1\\\\le x_2+3 implies that x_1\\\\le 6. Thus, assuming that no other constraint such as x_1\\\\le 5 or x_1<6 belongs to the definition, the constraint x_1\\\\le 6 is added to the zone definition. Figure in \\\\mathbb R^2 showing x_1\\\\le 3, x_1\\\\le x_2+3 and their intersections * the constraints x_1\\\\le x_2+3, x_2\\\\le x_3+3 implies that x_1\\\\le x_3+6. Thus, assuming that no other constraint such as x_1\\\\le x_3+5 or x_1< x_3+6 belongs to the definition, the constraint x_1\\\\le x_3+6 is added to the zone definition. Actually, the two first cases above are particular cases of the third cases. Indeed, x_1\\\\le3 and x_2\\\\ge-3 can be rewritten as x_1\\\\le 0+3 and 0\\\\le x_2+3 respectively. And thus, the constraint x_1\\\\le x_2+6 added in the first example is similar to the constraint added in the third example. == Definition == We now fix a monoid (M,0,+) which is a subset of the real line. This monoid is traditionally the set of integers, rationals, reals, or their subset of non-negative numbers. === Constraints === In order to define the data structure difference bound matrix, it is first required to give a data structure to encode atomic constraints. Furthermore, we introduce an algebra for atomic constraints. This algebra is similar to the tropical semiring, with two modifications: * An arbitrary ordered monoid may be used instead of ℝ. * In order to distinguish between \\"< m\\" and \\"\\\\le m\\", the set of elements of the algebra must contains an information stating whether the order is strict or not. ==== Definition of constraints ==== The set of satisfiable constraints is defined as the set of pairs of the form: * (\\\\le,m), with m\\\\in M, which represents a constraint of the form \\\\le m, * (<,m), with m\\\\in M, where m is not a minimal element of M, which represents a constraint of the form < m, * (<,\\\\infty), which represents the absence of constraint. The set of constraint contains all satisfiable constraints and contains also the following unsatisfiable constraint: * (<,-\\\\infty). The subset \\\\\\\\{q\\\\in\\\\mathbb Q\\\\mid q\\\\le\\\\sqrt2\\\\\\\\} can not be defined using this kind of constraints. More generally, some convex polytopes can not be defined when the ordered monoid does not have the least-upper-bound property, even if each of the constraints in its definition uses at most two variables. ==== Operation on constraints ==== In order to generate a single constraint from a pair of constraints applied to the same (pair of) variable, we formalize the notion of intersection of constraints and of order over constraints. Similarly, in order to define a new constraints from existing constraints, a notion of sum of constraint must also be defined.  Order on constraints  We now define an order relation over constraints. This order symbolize the inclusion relation. First, the set \\\\\\\\{<,\\\\le\\\\\\\\} is considered as an ordered set, with < being inferior to ≤. Intuitively, this order is chosen because the set defined by x< c is strictly included in the set defined by x\\\\le c. We then state that the constraint (\\\\prec_1,m_1) is smaller than (\\\\prec_2,m_2) if either m_1< m_2 or (m_1=m_2 and \\\\prec_1 is less than \\\\prec_2). That is, the order on constraints is the lexicographical order applied from right to left. Note that this order is a total order. If M has the least-upper-bound property (or greatest-lower-bound property) then the set of constraints also have it.  Intersection of constraints  The intersection of two constraints, denoted as (\\\\prec_1,m_1)\\\\sqcap(\\\\prec_2,m_2), is then simply defined as the minimum of those two constraints. If M has the greatest-lower bound property then the intersection of an infinite number of constraints is also defined.  Sum of constraints  Given two variables x_1 and x_2 to which are applied constraints (\\\\prec_1,m_1) and (\\\\prec_2,m_2), we now explain how to generate the constraint satisfied by x_1+x_2. This constraint is called the sum of the two above-mentioned constraint, is denoted as (\\\\prec_1,m_1)+(\\\\prec_2,m_2) and is defined as (\\\\min(\\\\prec_1,\\\\prec_2),m_1+m_2). ==== Constraints as an algebra ==== Here is a list of algebraic properties satisfied by the set of constraints. * Both operations are associative and commutative, * Sum is distributive over intersection, that is, for any three constraints, ((\\\\prec_1,m_1)\\\\sqcap(\\\\prec_2,m_2))+(\\\\prec_3,m_3) equals ((\\\\prec_1,m_1)+(\\\\prec_3,m_3))\\\\sqcap((\\\\prec_2,m_2)+(\\\\prec_3,m_3)), * The intersection operation is idempotent, * The constraint (<,\\\\infty) is an identity for the intersection operation, * The constraint (\\\\le,0) is an identity for the sum operation, Furthermore, the following algebraic properties holds over satisfiable constraints: * The constraint (<,\\\\infty) is a zero for the sum operation, * It follows that the set of satisfiable constraints is an idempotent semiring, with (<,\\\\infty) as zero and (\\\\le,0) as unity. * If 0 is the minimum element of M, then (\\\\le,0) is a zero for the intersection constraints over satisfiable constraints. Over non-satisfiable constraints both operations have the same zero, which is (<,-\\\\infty). Thus, the set of constraints does not even form a semiring, because the identity of the intersection is distinct from the zero of the sum. === DBMs === Given a set of n variables, x_1,\\\\dots,x_n, a DBM is a matrix with column and rows indexed by 0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n and the entries are constraints. Intuitively, for a column C and a row R, the value m at position (C,R) represents C\\\\prec R+m. Thus, the zone defined by a matrix D((\\\\prec_{C,R},m_{C,R}))_{C,R\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n}\\\\\\\\}, denoted by \\\\mathcal R(D), is \\\\\\\\{(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n)\\\\in\\\\mathbb R\\\\mid \\\\bigwedge_{C,R\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\}}C\\\\prec_{C,R}R+m_{C,R}\\\\\\\\}. Note that C\\\\prec R+m is equivalent to C-R\\\\prec m, thus the entry (\\\\prec,m) is still essentially an upper bound. Note however that, since we consider a monoid M, for some values of C and R the real C-R does not actually belong to the monoid. Before introducing the definition of a canonical DBM, we need to define and discuss an order relation on those matrices. ==== Order on those matrices ==== A matrix D is considered to be smaller than a matrix D' if each of its entries are smaller. Note that this order is not total. Given two DBMs D and D', if D is smaller than or equal to D', then \\\\mathcal R(D)\\\\subseteq\\\\mathcal R(D'). The greatest-lower-bound of two matrices D and D', denoted by D\\\\sqcap D', has as its (a,b) entry the value (\\\\prec_{a,b},m_{a,b})\\\\sqcap(\\\\prec'_{a,b},m'_{a,b}). Note that since \\\\sqcap is the «sum» operation of the semiring of constraints, the operation \\\\sqcap is the «sum» of two DBMs where the set of DBMs is considered as a module. Similarly to the case of constraints, considered in section \\"Operation on constraints\\" above, the greatest-lower-bound of an infinite number of matrices is correctly defined as soon as M satisfies the greatest-lower-bound property. The intersection of matrices/zones is defined. The union operation is not defined, and indeed, a union of zone is not a zone in general. For an arbitrary set \\\\mathcal D of matrices which all defines the same zone Z, \\\\sqcap_{D\\\\in\\\\mathcal D}D also defines Z. It thus follow that, as long as M has the greatest-lower-bound property, each zone which is defined by at least a matrix has a unique minimal matrix defining it. This matrix is called the canonical DBM of Z. ==== First definition of canonical DBM ==== We restate the definition of a canonical difference bound matrix. It is a DBM such that no smaller matrix defines the same set. It is explained below how to check whether a matrix is a DBM, and otherwise how to compute a DBM from an arbitrary matrix such that both matrices represents the same set. But first, we give some examples. ==== Examples of matrices ==== We first consider the case where there is a single clock x_1.  The real line  We first give the canonical DBM for \\\\mathbb R. We then introduce another DBM which encode the set \\\\mathbb R. This allow to find constraints which must be satisfied by any DBM. The canonical DBM of the set of real is \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{ll}(\\\\le,0)&(<,\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(<,\\\\infty)&(\\\\le,0)\\\\end{array}\\\\right). It represents the constraints 0\\\\le 0+0, x_1\\\\le 0+\\\\infty, 0\\\\le x_1+\\\\infty and 0\\\\le0+0. All of those constraints are satisfied independently of the value assigned to x_1. In the remaining of the discussion, we will not explicitly describe constraints due to entries of the form (<,\\\\infty), since those constraints are systematically satisfied. The DBM \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{ll}(<,\\\\infty)&(<,\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(<,\\\\infty)&(<,\\\\infty)\\\\end{array}\\\\right) also encodes the set of real. It contains the constraints 0<0+\\\\infty and x_1< x_1+\\\\infty which are satisfied independently on the value of x_1. This show that in a canonical DBM D, a diagonal entry is never greater than (\\\\le,0), because the matrix obtained from D by replacing the diagonal entry by (\\\\le,0) defines the same set and is smaller than D.  The empty set  We now consider many matrices which all encodes the empty set. We first give the canonical DBM for the empty set. We then explain why each of the DBM encodes the empty set. This allow to find constraints which must be satisfied by any DBM. The canonical DBM of the empty set, over one variable, is \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{ll}(<,-\\\\infty)&(<,-\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(<,-\\\\infty)&(<,-\\\\infty)\\\\end{array}\\\\right). Indeed, it represents the set satisfying the constraint 0<0-\\\\infty, 0< x_1-\\\\infty, x_1< 0-\\\\infty and x_1< x_1-\\\\infty. Those constraints are unsatisfiable. The DBM \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{ll}(<,\\\\infty)&(<,-\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(<,\\\\infty)&(<,\\\\infty)\\\\end{array}\\\\right) also encodes the empty set. Indeed, it contains the constraint x_1< 0-\\\\infty which is unsatisfiable. More generally, this show that no entry can be (<,-\\\\infty) unless all entries are (<,-\\\\infty). The DBM \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{ll}(<,\\\\infty)&(<,\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(<,\\\\infty)&(<,-1)\\\\end{array}\\\\right) also encodes the empty set. Indeed, it contains the constraint x_1< x_1-1 which is unsatisfiable. More generally, this show that the entry in the diagonal line can not be smaller than (\\\\le,0) unless it is (<,-\\\\infty). The DBM \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{ll}(<,\\\\infty)&(<,1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\le,-1)&(<,\\\\infty)\\\\end{array}\\\\right) also encodes the empty set. Indeed, it contains the constraints 0< x_1+1 and x_1\\\\le -1 which are contradictory. More generally, this show that, for each C,R\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\}, if m_{C,R}=-m_{R,C}, then \\\\prec_{R,C} and \\\\prec_{C,R} are both equal to ≤. The DBM \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{ll}(<,\\\\infty)&(\\\\le,1)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\le,-2)&(<,\\\\infty)\\\\end{array}\\\\right) also encodes the empty set. Indeed, it contains the constraints 0\\\\le x_1+1 and x_1\\\\le -2 which are contradictory. More generally, this show that for each C,R\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\}, -m_{C,R}\\\\le m_{R,C}, unless m_{C,R} is -\\\\infty.  Strict constraints  The examples given in this section are similar to the examples given in the Example section above. This time, they are given as DBM. The DBM \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{lll}(\\\\le,0)&(<,\\\\infty)&(<,\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(<,\\\\infty)&(\\\\le,0)&(\\\\le,3)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\le,3)&(<,\\\\infty)&(\\\\le,0)\\\\end{array}\\\\right) represents the set satisfying the constraints x_2\\\\le 3 and x_1\\\\le x_2+3. As mentioned in the Example section, both of those constraints implies that x_1\\\\le 6. It means that the DBM \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{lll}(\\\\le,0)&(\\\\le,6)&(<,\\\\infty)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(<,\\\\infty)&(\\\\le,0)&(\\\\le,3)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\(\\\\le,3)&(<,\\\\infty)&(\\\\le,0)\\\\end{array}\\\\right) encodes the same zone. Actually, it is the DBM of this zone. This shows that in any DBM ((\\\\prec_{C,R},m_{C,R}))_{c,r\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\}}, for each 1\\\\le i,j\\\\le n, the constraint (\\\\prec_{x_i,0},m_{x_i,0}) is smaller than the constraint (\\\\prec_{x_j,0},m_{x_j,0})+(\\\\prec_{x_i,x_j},m_{x_i,x_j}). As explained in the Example section, the constant 0 can be considered as any variable, which leads to the more general rule: in any DBM ((\\\\prec_{C,R},m_{C,R}))_{c,r\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\}}, for each a,b,c\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\}, the constraint (\\\\prec_{a,b},m_{a,b}) is smaller than the constraint (\\\\prec_{c,b},m_{c,b})+(\\\\prec_{a,c},m_{a,c}). === Three definition of canonical DBM === As explained in the introduction of the section Difference Bound Matrix, a canonical DBM is a DBM whose rows and columns are indexed by (0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n), whose entries are constraints. Furthermore, it follows one of the following equivalent properties. * there are no smaller DBM defining the same zone, * for each a,b,c\\\\in\\\\\\\\{0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\}, the constraint (\\\\prec_{a,b},m_{a,b}) is smaller than the constraint (\\\\prec_{c,b},m_{c,b})+(\\\\prec_{a,c},m_{a,c}) * given the directed graph G with edges \\\\\\\\{0,x_1,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\} and arrows (a,b) labelled by (\\\\prec_{a,b},m_{a,b}), the shortest path from any edge a to any edge b is the arrow (a,b). This graph is called the potential graph of the DBM. The last definition can be directly used to compute the canonical DBM associated to a DBM. It suffices to applies the Floyd–Warshall algorithm to the graph and associates to each entry (a,b) the shortest path from a to b in the graph. If this algorithm detects a cycle of negative length, this means that the constraints are not satisfiable, and thus that the zone is empty. == Operations on zones == As stated in the introduction, the main interest of DBMs is that they allow to easily and efficiently implements operations on zones. We first recall operations which were considered above: * testing for the inclusion of a zone Z_1 in a zone Z_2 is done by testing whether the canonical DBM of Z_1 is smaller than or equal to the canonical BDM of Z_2, * A DBM for the intersection of a set of zones is the greatest-lower-bound of the DBM of those zones, * testing for zone emptiness consists in checking whether the canonical DBM of the zone consists only of (<,-\\\\infty), * testing whether a zone is the entire space consists in checking whether the DBM of the zone consists only of (<,\\\\infty). We now describe operations which were not considered above. The first operations described below have clear geometrical meaning. The last ones become corresponds to operations which are more natural for clock valuations. === Sum of zones === The Minkowski sum of two zones, defined by two DBMs D and D', is defined by the DBM D+D' whose (a,b) entry is D_{a,b}+D'_{a,b}. Note that since + is the «product» operation of the semiring of constraints, the operation + over DBMs is not actually an operation of the module of DBM. In particular, it follows that, in order to translate a zone Z by a direction v, it suffices to add the DBM of \\\\\\\\{v\\\\\\\\} to the DBM of Z. === Projection of a component to a fixed value === Let d\\\\in M a constant. Given a vector \\\\vec x=(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n), and an index 1\\\\le i\\\\le n, the projection of the i-th component of \\\\vec x to d is the vector (x_1,\\\\dots,x_{i-1},d,x_{i+1},\\\\dots,x_n). In the language of clock, for d=0, this corresponds to resetting the i-th clock. Projecting the i-th component of a zone Z to d consists simply in the set of vectors of Z with their i-th component to d. This is implemented on DBM by setting the components (x_{i},a) to (\\\\le,d)+D(0,a) and the components (a,x_{i}) to (\\\\le,-d)+D(0,a) === Future and past of a zone === Let us call the future the zone F=\\\\\\\\{(t,\\\\dots,t)\\\\mid t\\\\in\\\\mathbb R_{\\\\ge0}\\\\\\\\} and the past the zone P=\\\\\\\\{(-t,\\\\dots,-t)\\\\mid t\\\\in\\\\mathbb R_{\\\\ge0}\\\\\\\\}. Given a point \\\\vec x=(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n)\\\\in\\\\mathbb R^n, the future of \\\\vec x is defined as \\\\\\\\{(x_1+t,\\\\dots,x_n+t)\\\\mid t\\\\in\\\\mathbb R_{\\\\ge0}\\\\\\\\}=F+\\\\\\\\{\\\\vec x\\\\\\\\}, and the past of \\\\vec x is defined as P+\\\\\\\\{\\\\vec x\\\\\\\\}. The names future and past comes from the notion of clock. If a set of n clocks are assigned to the values x_1, x_2, etc. then in their future, the set of assignment they'll have is the future of \\\\vec x. Given a zone Z, the future of Z are the union of the future of each points of the zone. The definition of the past of a zone is similar. The future of a zone can thus be defined as F+Z, and hence can easily be implemented as a sum of DBMs. However, there is even a simpler algorithm to apply to DBM. It suffices to change every entries (x_i,0) to (<,\\\\infty). Similarly, the past of a zone can be computed by setting every entries (0,x_i) to (<,\\\\infty). == See also == * Region (model checking) – a zone, minimal under inclusion, satisfying some properties == References == * Difference Bound Matrices Lecture #20 of Advanced Model Checking Joost-Pieter Katoen * Category:Polytopes Polytope ","title":"Difference bound matrix"},{"id":"60274721","text":"Espen Thorstenson (27 November 1940 – 15 January 2019) was a Norwegian film director. ==Career== Thorstenson was educated at the Institut des hautes études cinématographiques in Paris.

This suggestion also comes from the timing of the event - it coincided with traditional signs of Spring, an important season in Pagan traditions. It has also be seen as a potential form of penitence in preparation for the Christian season of Lent, a theme of which is penance. Lent would begin on Ash Wednesday, the day which followed the 'Whipping Tom' event. == Practices == The day began with a fair in the Newarke area, with music and entertainment, as well as food. The area was described as having a festive mood, and would have been a great source of entertainment for the people of Leicester, with people gathering from across Leicester in the area to celebrate. A hockey-like game was played, with the gates to the Newarke area acting as goals. The hockey game would come to a conclusion shortly after midday, with most women and young children vacating the area at this time. The remaining men and boys would have been those participating in that year’s event. The 'whipping' portion of the day began at around 1:00 PM. At this time, three men would emerge wearing blue clothes, one carrying a bell, and the others carrying a 'large waggon whip' each. The aim of the remaining men and teenage boys in the area would be to try and capture the bell, or at least stop it from being rung, whilst the men clad in blue would try to defend themselves and the bell using their whips. The game would only conclude when the bell was seized and the ringing stopped. This could take as long as several hours. The whippings were limited to below the knees, and the 'Toms' could not whip anyone who was kneeling. Kneeling was a sign of submission to the 'Toms', and anyone who knelt would not receive a whipping. There was also an option to make a two pence donation instead of being whipped. However, it is believed that this was not always adhered to, depending on the 'Toms' participating that year, with the donation sometimes not acting as the barrier to a whipping that it should. This was introduced as a way to allow people to access the Newarke area who had a need to, without them necessarily taking part in the whippings. == Abolition == Whilst a number of pitiful safeguards were put in place, such as limits on where on the body people could be whipped, the event was seen as a brutal celebration, resulting in its abolition by an Act of Parliament 1846. The bill, titled the Leicester Improvement Act, was passed on 16th February 1846 to put an end to the practice, but this was met with some fierce opposition from the 'Whipping Toms', who saw the Act as an attack on a way of life and the end of a much- loved local custom and tradition. They did not heed the warnings of the Leicester Improvement Act and carried out the custom the following year in 1847, desisting in 1848 and 1849 with the threat of a substantial £5 fine to be paid by anyone who had carried on their position as a 'Whipping Tom', due to the perceived severity of the whippings given by the 'Toms'. The tradition can be seen as dead by 1848. == References == Category:Leicester ","title":"Leicester's Whipping Toms"},{"id":"60274978","text":"State Route 134 (SR 134) is an east-west state highway in southeastern Tennessee.

She is known as a whistleblower for exposing the poor handling of the Rochdale child sex abuse ring case by her own force. Oliver is also a media personality known for her participation on Celebrity Big Brother. ==Law enforcement career== Oliver joined Greater Manchester Police in 1997 as a Police Constable. She remained with the force until her resignation in March 2013 in response to the handling of the Rochdale child sex abuse ring. ===Exposing the Rochdale child sex abuse ring=== ====Operation Augusta in Hulme and Rusholme==== As a detective constable, Oliver was the lead investigator on the Rochdale child sex abuse ring case for the Greater Manchester Police. She claims that the convictions that were made in the Rochdale child sex abuse ring of 9 men in early 2012 barely scratched the surface of what she describes as a highly organised crime group that numbered hundreds of perpetrators and countless young victims. At the time that Oliver started investigating the sex abuse ring she had already worked for the police force since 1996. She had been part of The Serious Crime Division of the GMP and investigated countless gangland murders, shootings, kidnappings, rapes and witness protection jobs. The first contact with the scandal was her investigation into multiple severe sexual assaults perpetrated by mainly Pakistani men. During her work in Operation Augusta Oliver interviewed many victims, some as young as eleven. She was again shocked by the lack of response of the police force and the lack of efforts in trying to protect the victims. She claims that it seemed as if the authorities had already known about the crimes for ten years when she started working on Operation Augusta. In Operation Augusta almost identical pattern could be observed to what was happening in Rochdale. In the operation 26 teenage girls had been identified who had been trafficked to about 206 suspects in Hulme and Rusholme. There were abused by men of mainly Pakistani background. One of the girls that was abused by suspects in Operation Augusta died in Rochdale. In Operation Augusta, 16 child victims and 97 perpetrators were identified- of which 3 were taken to court. The television programme Dispatches filmed a documentary called \\"Edge of the City\\". During the filming of the documentary the crew found out that girls in Yorkshire were being groomed and abused by a network of men. The girl that had died in Rochdale was part of the group of girls that were being filmed by the team. The Greater Manchester Police had the airing of the documentary delayed in fear that it would make the failure of the force in protecting the girls public. Then a small group of detectives was formed to deal with the problem of the grooming gangs afterwards. In 2005 Oliver left the force as her husband, Norman, was dying of terminal cancer. When she returned she claims that the investigations were closed. None of the perpetrators had been prosecuted and the victims were still being abused. She was told that the victims \\"were prostitutes making a life style choice\\" and that they were \\"bad kids\\" and not credible witnesses. Oliver was disgusted by this and said that the victims were among the most vulnerable children within the British society. Mayor of Manchester's re-evaluation The Mayor of Manchester, Andy Burnham, ordered an independent report on Operation Augusta which was published on 14 January 2020. It found failings by police and children's services. Greater Manchester Police have accepted the report and apologised to the victims \\"who have been denied justice\\" and said it had established a major investigation team to look again at the abuse of Victoria and the other girls in 2004. The chief constable has asked that all lines of enquiry from 2004 should be pursued, and further information has emerged in 38 of the 52 cases with new victims and new alleged attackers. ====Operation Span in Rochdale==== In 2010 Oliver received a phone call about a job breaking in Rochdale. The phone call was an invitation to join Operation Span, which was the investigation of child grooming in Rochdale. The original investigation in 2008/9 had been a car crash. The girls had been labelled unreliable witnesses and the CPS had decided not to prosecute. Oliver was asked to try to regain the trust of the girls. She only agreed to take on the case because the department assured her that what happened in Operation Augusta wouldn't happen in this operation again. There had been an exhibit which was kept as evidence within the department. The fetus had been ceased within a termination of a pregnancy of a 13-year-old child (nicknamed Ruby). The exhibit had been found in a routine property review. The family had never given consent to have the fetus be kept as an exhibit. Her sister, who was at the time 15 years old was suspected to be a madam (procurer of prostitutes for pimps) for a group of Pakistani men and thus she had been arrested. As the patterns in Rochdale were identical to what had happened in Operation Augusta, Oliver was asked to join the investigation around the exhibit and the sisters. Oliver started her investigation by trying to gain the trust of the family of the two sisters. From the testimonies of the girls and their mother Olivers team found locations where the abuse had happened, vehicles used to transport the victims and identified many serial sex offenders. The family also did ID parades and helped police identify locations, times, phones numbers and names of the abusers. ====Intimidation of victim nicknamed Amber by the authorities and subsequent resignation==== Oliver claims that she was told by colleagues that they were planning on never using the testimonies of the family of the sisters and her mother (nicknamed Amber). She claims that they were trying to alienate the mother and make her go away and stop cooperating with the police so that there would be no evidence of the crimes. Oliver also said that they did not record the crimes that the family alleged in their testimonies and instead just buried all of the reports. When Oliver got upset about the handling of the case she claims one of her seniors told her, \\"Maggie, calm down. Listen: What would these kids ever contribute to society? They should have just been drowned at birth.\\" After this Oliver stormed off the job. Her colleagues proceeded to not tell the family that they weren't using their testimonies to prosecute the perpetrators. When they had to put up a trial because of public outrage they realised that they need the testimony of one of the girls for it. In order to force her to testify they turned her from a victim into an offender for the crimes. They used the video tapes of the interviews that Oliver had conducted her in order to prosecute her. Although the girl was never told what she was charged with, which is a breach of judicial procedures. She was portrayed as a madam, who procured other girls for the pedophile sex ring although she had only been 15 at that time. This would have never stood in court as the CPS had already identified her as a victim. But the girl was scared enough by the charges that she complied and testified again in the trial. Oliver was forbidden from talking to the family. After the trial was over Oliver talked to the family again. She asked whether they were aware that the daughter had been put on the indictment as one of the perpetrators within the pedophile network. They family wasn't aware of that at all. But what had happened is that she had had another baby and social services had taken that baby from her after birth. Now the family knew that the reason for that had been that she had been named as one of the perpetrators within the pedophile ring. Oliver suspects that the social services did that for intimidation and also in order to cover their wrongdoings within the whole ordeal. The baby was taken unlawfully as no court order by a judge had been obtained. One year after the child had been taken away a judge ruled that the baby was to be returned to the family. Not only had they taken the baby without a court order. It also came out later that member of social services had interviewed acquaintances of Amber in order to testify that she was a bad mother in order to take her children away from her. During the investigation social workers told her that they had been trying to get the police to take this problem seriously for years. Oliver said that the Child Protection Services were only equipped to deal with sexual abuse of children perpetrated by assaulters known by the victim (family members, teachers etc.) so that the type of assault taking place in grooming (by strangers) wasn't something that CPS was equipped to handle. Neither CPS nor the police had really felt responsible or had been equipped to deal with the new grooming phenomenon. Oliver claims that for 18 months she tried to be heard by different parts of the justice system including The Head of Serious Crime, The Chief Constable, The IPCC and The Home Office. She left the force in 2012 in disgust of the handling of the case by the Greater Manchester Police and the Crown Prosecution Service. Oliver did this with the intention of speaking out about the mishandling of the cases and informing the public. ====Allegations of ongoing cover-up==== Oliver claims that a lot of the men that were involved in the abuse of the girls have not been charged, arrested or imprisoned until today. One example was a suspect that impregnated a 13 year old (proven by DNA evidence from the fetus of the forced abortion) was released after two years. Countless others weren't charged at all or are already free again. She also claims that several men were fighting extradition and that they received legal aid from the government that amounts to millions of pounds in order to do that. ====Criticism of the charges brought forward==== Oliver said that the men could have been charged with crimes that would have carried higher sentences in the trial. Even though all of them had been perpetrators of rapes of dozens of underage girls a lot of them were never charged with rape. Not even the man that raped Ruby, where they had a fetus and DNA evidence to prove that he was guilty, was eventually charged with rape. Instead a lot of the suspects were only charged with conspiracy to rape or with human trafficking which were charges that were easier to prove. ====Criticism of the treatment of victims==== Oliver criticised the treatment of the victims by the authorities both during the investigation, during the trial and after the trials ended. She also said that as there are usually several perpetrators in grooming trials when victims testify in court they are questioned repeatedly by every lawyer of ever suspected perpetrator, which puts the victims under extreme stress and constitutes an immense re- victimisation. Oliver said that there should be a system in place that refers victims to support networks that include long term psychological counseling and other services. ==Media portrayals and appearances== Oliver was portrayed by Lesley Sharp in Three Girls, a BBC drama about the Rochdale child sex abuse ring. She also acted as a consultant for the series. Oliver was also a key contributor to The Betrayed Girls documentary by the BBC. Oliver appeared in Celebrity Big Brother 21, entering on day 1 and was evicted on day 18. ==Activism== Oliver founded the Maggie Oliver Foundation for the survivors of the Rochdale abuse scandal. The mission of the foundation is to \\"transform pain into power.\\" The foundation is planning on opening a network of \\"Maggie Oliver Centres\\" for women. It is intended to be run by volunteers and survivors of the scandal. In the house support will be given to those who have been affected by sexual abuse. They will receive help to access support, legal advice, therapy, training and education. Oliver is also a public speaker raising awareness on sexual abuse perpetrated by organised grooming gangs. Oliver regularly appears on the ITV programme Loose Women. There she started the Never Too Late To Tell campaign in December 2016, which encourages all survivors of sexual assault to speak out about what happened to them. On the programme she gave further advice on recording evidence, having an open dialogue with children, monitoring technology, enlisting help and looking for changes in children's behaviour as signs of abuse. ==Works== Oliver, Margaret (2019).

His work explores man's relationship with the natural world, animals, and environmental issues with a primary focus on the Alaskan wilderness. Since 2002 he has photographed his life at sea while working as a Bering Sea crab fisherman and during his summers as a captain of a Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishing boat in Alaska. ==Early life and education== Arnold was born in Vista, California, and grew up there. He has discussed the positive influence of his father, an avocado farmer, sport fisherman, and a photography enthusiast. Arnold and his father fished together throughout Arnold's childhood, including going to Alaska in the summers where Arnold first witnessed the Alaskan commercial fishing industry. Arnold attended Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona and earned his BFA in Photography at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco, California. ==Career== After graduating from college, Arnold decided to find work in Alaskan fisheries and photograph his experiences. He has said, \\"The sea is a great mystery to me. You never know what might show up in the net, pot, or hook. I love to photograph the creatures that we encounter: seabirds, marine mammals, octopus, the waves, the weather and the men and woman who live for it. I want give the viewer a visceral experience of what fish-work is all about. I also aim to educate the public about where our food comes from and talk about ways that commercial fishing and environmentalism can co-exist.\\" This body of work became Fish- Work, an ongoing photography project documenting Arnold's experiences of life at sea. Two years into his career as a Bering Sea fisherman, the Discovery Channel show Deadliest Catch began filming. Arnold appears in Season Two of Deadliest Catch, and one of his photographs ran on a billboard in Times Square advertising the show. His photographs have been exhibited widely and published in The New Yorker, National Geographic, The Paris Review, Time, The New York Times, California Sunday Magazine, Harper's, Outside, Esquire, The Guardian, and Juxtapoz, among others. ==Awards and grants== * 2017 Pictures of the Year International – 1st Place Feature Photo Story for \\"Unplugging the Selfie Generation\\" National Geographic Magazine ==Published books== Two books on Arnold's work have been published by Nazraeli Press: a 2011 monograph entitled Fish-Work: The Bering Sea and a 2011 titled Fishing with My Dad 1978–1995. ==Personal life== Arnold has worked seasonally as a commercial fisherman in Alaska since 1995, including seven years of crabbing in the Bering Sea aboard the f/v Rollo. He now captains a commercial gillnetter, harvesting wild and sustainable sockeye salmon in Bristol Bay, Alaska while living seasonally in an abandoned salmon cannery complex called Graveyard Point. Arnold is a vocal opponent to the proposed Pebble Mine in Alaska. Arnold's cat, Kitty, has been featured in his photographs and was on board the f/v Rollo for two Bering Sea crab seasons. Arnold has said, \\"She would climb around in the maze of stacked crab pots on deck stalking seabirds. I caught her sneaking up on an eagle that was 5 times her size once, so after that we decided to lock her up in eagle country. She was almost too fearless. She'd come out on deck and stand under dangling 800-pound crab pots. Now she's fat, sleeps all day, and destroys my power cords when she's hungry.\\" He has said that his photograph \\"Kitty and Horse Fisherman\\" is \\"probably the defining photo of my career. It captures a bit of everything I'm interested in as a photographer: The relationship between humans and animals, life at sea, and a bit of strangeness that leaves you with unanswered questions.\\" ==References== ==External links== *Official site of Corey Arnold *“Aleutian Dreams: Life as an Alaskan Fisherman“, The Guardian Online *“Dirty Birds“, The California Sunday Magazine *“Unplugging the Selfie Generation”, National Geographic Magazine *“Photographs: Corey Arnold Fish-Work,” The Paris Review *\\"Corey Arnold's Aleutian Dreams\\", Juxtapoz Magazine Category:Living people Category:Artists from Portland, Oregon Category:1976 births Category:American photographers Category:Academy of Art University alumni Category:American fishers Category:National Geographic photographers ","title":"Corey Arnold"},{"id":"60275125","text":"Daniel Juárez may refer to: * Daniel Juárez (footballer, born 1975), Argentine midfielder * Daniel Juárez (footballer, born 2001), Argentine midfielder ","title":"Daniel Juárez"},{"id":"60275150","text":"Ray Barnes was a member of the Arizona House of Representatives from 2003 through 2011.

He is an author of more than 200 works in linguistics and a specialist in Japanese studies and the history of linguistics. == Life == Vladimir Alpatov was born in the family of a historian and writer Mikhail Alpatov and a historian and byzantinist Zinaida Udaltsova. He graduated from the Department of theoretical and applied linguistics of the Philological faculty of the Moscow State University in 1968. In 1971 he obtained his Candidate Degree (The grammatical system of politeness forms in modern standard Japanese) at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In 1972, he started working at this institute. In 1983 he obtained his Doctoral Degree (Problems of morpheme and word in moden Japanese). For almost 20 years, he was a deputy director of the Institute of Oriental Studies. Since 1993, he has been teaching a course on the history of linguistics at the Moscow State University as well as at the Russian State University for the Humanities. He is also an author of a university textbook on the history of linguistics (1st ed., 1998). In 2008 he was elected a Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 2012, Vladimir Alpatov was elected the director of the Institute of Linguistics of the Russian Academy of Sciences for five years. In 2017, he was succeeded by Andrej Kibrik. == Research == Vladimir Alpatov is a specialist in oriental languages (first of all, Japanese), he is one of the authors of a collective 2-volume Theoretical grammar of Japanese (2008). In his Candidate and Doctoral dissertations, Japanese data were used for tackling more general theoretical questions on the notions of word and morpheme, grammatical category, agglutination and some other problematic issues in general morphology and theory of grammar. Among the main research interests of Vladimir Alpatov is the history of linguistics. He is one of the leading Russian specialists in this field. He is the author of a comprehensive manual on the history of linguistic studies, which briefly describes the development of these studies from the ancient times to the middle of the twentieth century. Equally important are his studies on linguistics in the USSR: he is the author of monographs about Mikhail Bakhtin and Valentin Voloshinov, about the fate of many Slavic and Turkic scholars during the period of Great Purge, about the controversial personality of Nicholas Marr and the fate of his Japhetic theory. Among Alpatov’s other works are studies on Japanese sociolinguistics as well as on the language policy in the USSR. ==Major works (books)== * Категории вежливости в современном японском языке (1973, 2006, 2009, 2011) * Структура грамматических единиц в современном японском языке (1979) * Япония: язык и общество (1988, 2003) * Изучение японского языка в России и СССР (1988) * История одного мифа.

His primary work is in the field of Early Modern Philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics and focuses on the philosophy of John Locke. He is the author of Locke’s Metaphysics (Oxford Clarendon Press, 2013) in which he takes a unique approach to John Locke's work \\"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\\" to view it as a strong Metaphysical text, rather than just that of epistemology. Some ideas approached in his book focus on \\"Locke's denial that bodies can be co- located\\", that \\"empty spaces within a body are not parts of [them]\\", that \\"[Locke's] relativism about identity equips him to respond to objects to his account of personal identity\\", and that of Locke's \\"rejection of essentialism\\". Stuart's book received attention from reviewers as a strong source for Lockean scholars to consider; still, several crucial critiques were offered, including Stuart's interpretation of substance and mode, as well as Stuart's interpretation of Locke's account of identity.https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/locke-s- metaphysics/https://read.dukeupress.edu/the-philosophical- review/article/124/1/153/78607/Locke-s- Metaphysicshttps://ojs.lib.uwo.ca/index.php/locke/article/view/735/378 Stuart has expressed sympathy to the unpopular Ontological view of Animalism (philosophy).https://www.une.edu/calendar/2014/metaphysics-personal-identity.

He was the founding chairman of the African National Congress Youth League. While at the University of the Witwatersrand, Nkomo was one of the first black students to serve on the Students Representative Committee. After graduation, he practiced as a teacher and medical doctor in various parts of Pretoria. He was later also involved in the Moral Re-Armament Movement. He was also elected president of the South African Institute of Race Relations, and was a steward of the Methodist Church and Trustee of the Bantu Welfare Trust. == Early life and education == William Frederick Nkomo was born in Makapanstad, Transvaal in 1915. He was the son of a Methodist Minister, Reverend Abraham Nkomo. Nkomo attended primary school in Mahikeng and Klerksdorp, studied for his secondary education at St Peter's School in Rosettenville and matriculated at Healdtown Institute in the Eastern Cape. Nkomo studied at the South African Native College (University of Fort Hare) and obtained a BA degree from the University of South Africa. He studied medicine on a scholarship at the University of the Witwatersrand in 1941 and did his internship at McCords Hospital in Durban. He practiced in Lady Selborne and Atteridgeville in Pretoria. == Political activism == Nkomo joined the African National Congress in the early 1940s. In 1944, he helped found the ANC Youth League with Nelson Mandela, Anton Lembede, Ashley Peter Mda, Walter Sisulu and Oliver Tambo. He later relinquished his position as provisional chairman of the league to complete his medical studies. In 1956, due to his militance, he was summarily expelled by the party. In the 1960s he became associated with the Black Consciousness Movement. As documented in Frank Buchman's Legacy, the Seeds of Change for Africa the authors Peter Hannon and Suzan Burrell write that, \\"WF Nkomo had been labelled a communist and he in turn viewed whites as Fascists”. However Nkomo's activism was in search for equality within South Africa and believed that a future bloodbath within his country be avoided. Nkomo heard George Daneel, a former Springbok, Dutch Reformed Church priest and anti-apartheid activist, speak positively about change at a Moral Re-Armament multiracial conference in Lusaka. Daneel spoke publicly \\"That it was the feelings of racial superiority in white men like himself that were creating the conditions for producing bloody revolution. He said that he had been wrong and that he was giving his life to work for a South Africa where all had a full and equal part\\". In response Nkomo stated: \\"I have always been a revolutionary, and I have spent much of my life in the struggle for the liberation of my people. Here I see white men change, and black men change, and I myself have decided to change. I realise that I cannot love my people unless I am prepared to fight for them in a new dimension, free of bitterness and hate\\". In pursuance of the strategy of non-violence he became a member of the Moral Re-Armament movement after attending its conference in Caux, Switzerland in 1953. To promote peace, he featured in two films (one on him, called A Man For All People) and another with leaders like Kwame Nkrumah, Nnamdi Azikiwe, Jomo Kenyatta and Manase Moerane. Following the Sharpeville massacre in 1961, Nkomo was a mediator between the government and the victims. He was one of the leaders who discussed the political situation in South Africa with Dag Hammarskjöld who was Secretary General of the United Nations during his visit to this country in January 1961. 272x272px 14 August 1968, Nkomo was invited to speak at the University of Cape Town's Day of Affirmation of Academic and Human Freedom. His address, The Courage to Think followed in a series after that of Robert Kennedy's Ripple of Hope speech in June 1966. In his speech he said, \\"The idea of a common patriotism and nationalism was always recognised by all. It was only in recent times with the emergence of apartheid theoreticians that the country definitely deviated from the path of a common nationalism.\\" \\"Some of the youth are courageous enough to look at everything with a crucially critical mind, and there are those who follow the path of least resistance, that of merely accepting things from their forebears without questioning. If it does not appear to be the case in our country it has at any rate manifested itself in other parts of the world.A quick look at the recent events affecting the students in Berkeley, U.S.A,; in Columbia, U.S.A.; at the Sorbonne, Paris; in Rome; in Prague; and elsewhere will clearly indicate that the youth as represented by the students have become impatient with systems where they are merely on the receiving end; they are beginning to question things in a dynamic and revolutionary miner. They are coming to a realisation that the youth and the students especially constitute an important social factor in the promotion of social change. \\"The revolt of youth must be accepted and what is needed is that instead of pooh-poohing it, the world should come to terms with it. After all, these very young people will be the leaders of tomorrow. History has shown clearly that reformers have nearly always been young men. The older folk have followed in the wake of their prophetic declarations and put these into the accepted traditions of the people\\". == Community work and philanthropy == Nkomo mentored young people and adults and founded a secondary school in Marabastad. He granted scholarships to help students pursue medical degrees and other education. Nkomo's medical practice was known to not charge the old and poor. Nkomo was trustee of the Bantu Welfare Trust and served on several boards in Atteridgeville and Lady Selborne. He was Honorary Doctor for Itireleng School for the Blind near Hammanskraal. == Recognition == The community of Atteridgeville annually celebrates WF Nkomo Day in his honour. Today a secondary school in Atteridgeville is named after him as well as WF Nkomo Street, formerly Church Street, running from historic Church Square in Pretoria central to Atteridgeville (City of Tshwane). Nelson Mandela mentioned Nkomo in 1998, in a speech given at the installation of the University of the Witwatersrand's Vice-Chancellor and Principal, Colin Bundy. Mandela is quoted as saying the following: \\"This evening brings many memories from the past and many hopes for the future. I remember my own days as a student and I honour some of my fellows who studied, debated and agitated on this campus. Their names are legend: Joe Slovo, Ismael Meer, Harold Wolpe, J N Singh, William Nkomo and Ruth First. They count amongst those who set forth a message and an ethos in direct contrast to the fear, oppression and subservience which legislation of the time sought to impose and inculcate. They represent one of the proud strands in the tradition of Wits, a strand which the university will undoubtedly seek to build upon as it grapples with its role in the development of a new kind of South African society\\". == Death == Mrs and Dr Nkomo at home Nkomo died in 1972, following cardiac arrest at HF Verwoerd Hospital, now Steve Biko Academic Hospital. He is buried alongside his wife, Susan at the Rebecca Street Cemetery in Pretoria. == References == Category:1915 births Category:1972 deaths Category:20th-century South African physicians Category:African National Congress politicians Category:People from Pretoria Category:University of Fort Hare alumni Category:University of South Africa alumni Category:University of the Witwatersrand alumni ","title":"William Frederick Nkomo"},{"id":"60275397","text":"Kathryn Wylde is an American not-for-profit executive.

Diseases of the Colon & Rectum, 60(6), 567-576. doi:10.1097/DCR.0000000000000844 This refers to not only physicians currently practicing medicine, but also those in training. Signs of burnout have even been traced back to medical students who have experienced disconnect between taught professional behaviors and those witnessed in practice. \\"Our data show wide variability in the prevalence of burnout by clinical specialty, and that anxiety, social support and empathy during medical school relate to the risk of burnout during residency,\\" says Liselotte Dyrbye, M.D., a Mayo Clinic researcher and first author of the article \\"Association of Clinical Specialty With Symptoms of Burnout and Career Choice Regret Among US Resident Physicians\\" === Signs === Burnout has been referred to as a compilation of cynicism, depersonalization, and a low sense of accomplishment.Gazelle, G., Liebschutz, J. M., & Riess, H. (2014). Physician Burnout: Coaching a Way Out. Journal of General Internal Medicine, 30(4), 508-513. doi:10.1007/s11606-014-3144-y Other symptoms included feelings of emotional exhaustion, inadequacy, and detachment. This is thought to be due to imbalances whether that be in regards to workload, personal values, incentive, justice, and a sense of community. Factors such as time pressure, chaotic work environments and a lack of alignment between physicians and executives have been known to exacerbate this burden. These elements can cause clinicians to become frustrated and overwhelmed. Moreover, the correlation between lack of control and burnout has been explored and shows that an increased sense of lack of control has been linked to a greater risk of being affected by burnout. Physician Burnout of medical practitioners isn’t an individual problem. It has consequences for the whole healthcare industry. Healthcare in the US is expensive; but it is even more costly to replace a physician (approximately $250,000 to $1000000). The practitioner also takes more leaves to reduce their burnout; which affects their overall productivity and reduces earnings significantly. Also, patients might switch to other clinicians and medical practitioners if they are absent for too long. Furthermore, the impact of burnout has shown to negatively impact overall care delivery, more error rates are found, and patient care is gravely affected. An AMIA study has shown that physician burnout has the following indicators: * More physician turnover * More instances of substance abuse and higher rates of addiction in physicians * More cases of health malpractice in the overall clinic or department. * Excessive errors in patient care, treatments; sometimes proven to be fatal. * Time and money wasted is useless, repetitive tests and unrequired consultations One study, claimed that \\"We found that physicians with burnout had more than twice the odds of self-reported medical error, after adjusting for specialty, work hours, fatigue and work unit safety rating(...)\\" === Models === Likewise, burnout has been analyzed using differing conceptual models. One strategy examined burnout as a product of three stages. Stage one consists of exhaustion at work that progresses into detachment and negative feelings at work that later starts to affect patients and coworkers in stage two. Lastly, stage three is composed of feelings of inadequacy and failure. However, a more recent approach sought to choose three stages that served as a bridge between said stages and imbalances. The first groups together all job stressors such as imbalances caused by work demands while the second solely addressed individual strain in the form of anxiety and exhaustion. Lastly, the third described changes in mood and behavior as defensive coping that could be closely linked to cynicism. == Impacted populations == === Physicians === The progression of physician burnout takes a toll on the individual whether it be a medical student or practicing clinician mainly through adverse psychological affects that have lasting consequences. A concept known as asymmetrical rewards speaks of how physicians are rarely recognized for what they do well, yet there is much attention surrounding medical malpractice suits ready to capitalize on a physician’s errors. In addition, clinicians become desensitized to patients and medicine resulting a perspective shift towards viewing patient care as a chore more than a desire to heal. However, the effects of burnout extend past the physicians themselves to ultimately affect anyone in contact with them. === Resident Physicians === Burnout in physicians appears to be the highest for resident physicians. Due to the large number of hours taken on by resident physicians, they are often more prone to burnout. In addition to the long hours, residents are still in the process of learning clinical knowledge. Stressful events, such as death of a patient, managing a critically ill patient, medical error, and verbal abuse from patients, their families and/or colleagues have been reported in a study done at medical schools in the Philadelphia area. In this study, researchers found that 70% of residents experienced at least one work-related stress event ad that nearly 5% showed symptoms of PTSD from a stressful event at work. Similar to the work-life balance struggle physicians face, residents may struggle to manage everything going on in their lives. The negative effects of this burnout extend far out, from a decreased job satisfaction, being absent while at work and possibility for medical errors. Some studies have even shown reduced feelings of personal accomplishment and emotional exhaustion. Residents who considered themselves to be experiencing burnout report more medical errors than residents who do not. In a 24 month-long study performed at Mayo Clinic in 2016, found that burnout and low job satisfaction were associated with reductions in professional work effort. In 2008, the Healthcare Management Review suggested that healthcare settings that put programs in place to reduce physician burnout would see greater patient satisfaction and recovery. Resident interventions aimed to improve communication and role conflict have been shown to improve self-acceptance, acceptance of aggression and inner directedness in residents, interns, and nurses. Although burnout in resident physicians has become common knowledge in the medical community, few systems are in place to combat this issue. Some possible suggestions for a solution to this issue are support groups, stress- management/coping training and self-care education. === Medical Students === Medical students can also become victim to burnout, being that between 43-45% of medical student students report feelings of burn-out. It has been proposed that the root of physician burnout stems for physicians years in medical school. In 2010, a study was done by Emory School of Medicine and Vanderbilt School of Medicine to understand the prevalence and factors of burnout in medical students. According to these universities, burnout has been described as emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and decreased physical exhaustion.The study administered Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey to 249 medical students. This survey asked questions about stress levels, workload, relaxation habits, support systems and demographics. The study found that 21% of first year students, 41% of second year students, 43% of third year, and 31% of fourth year students felt symptoms of burnout. Determining factors to a higher right of burnout are loser support, higher stress, and feelings of lack of control over one's life. There is no single solution to this issue, but easing student and physician workload and promoting wellness and resilience in the medical field has been shown to help. Specifically in medical students, mindfulness-based meditation sessions have been shown to improve mood disturbance. === Colleagues === Friends and family often feel the burden when interacting with burned-out clinicians since most of these individuals will be disengaged and can exhibit symptoms of major depressive disorder. Coworkers are also likely to be impacted. For example, burnout initiated by a chaotic, unsupportive work environment results in higher rates of miscommunication and unresolved conflicts. It has also been shown that a workforce afflicted by burnout contributes to an overall greater hostile atmosphere. === Health Industry === Other impacted populations include the patients and healthcare industry seeing as burnout results in decreased quality of care.Dewa, C. S., Loong, D., Bonato, S., Xuan Thanh, N., & Jacobs, P. (2015). How does burnout affect physician productivity? A systematic literature review. BMC Health Services Research, 325(14). doi:10.1186/1472-6963-14-325 Research has generated evidence supporting an inverse correlation between burnout and productivity. Thus the shift in decreased productivity sometimes ends in decreased physician retention due to low job satisfaction and decreased mental health. Since successful medical interactions are based on trust between providers and patients, this constant staff turnover can go on to reflect poorly upon the institution. == Treatment & prevention == === Individual-approach === Treatment strategies first focused on addressing the individual. Physician-oriented approaches ranged from cognitive behavioral techniques (CBT) such as meditation and coping strategies to professional coaching which aimed at reinforcing individual resilience. Professional coaching involves the implementation of mentors that would aid in guiding physicians using their previous experiences with patients. Gazelle, Liebschutz, and Riess discussed the benefits of professional coaching as being able to cater to each provider using his or her own previous experiences therefore personalizing the intervention as opposed to CBT which delivers treatment in a standardized manner. On the other hand, Dr. Kelly speaks of how altering perception of patients from chores and potential litigation sources to opportunities to heal is key to the reversal of burnout. === Organizational-approach === However, some research suggests that a combination of individual, team, and organization approaches is the only way to address all levels of burnout and successfully put an end to this epidemic.Wuest, T. K., MD, MMM, Goldberg, M. J., MD, & Kelly, J. D., IV, MD. (2017). Cinical Faceoff: Physician Burnout - Fact, Fantasy, or the Fourth Component of Triple Aim? Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research, 475(5), 1309-1314. doi:10.1007/s11999-016-5193-5 Generally, organizational approaches have shown much promise as successful treatment options by reducing workloads and distributing more flexible schedules among employees. A shift to realign goals between physicians and executive administrators could also contribute to reducing the risk of burnout. A systematic review analyzing individual and organizational strategies found that organization-oriented approaches were more effective.Panagioti, M., Panagopoulou, E., Bower, P., Lewith, G., Kontopantelis, E., Chew-Graham, C., . . . Esmail, A. (2017). Controlled Interventions to Reduce Burnout in Physicians A Systematic Review and Meta- analysis. JAMA Internal Medicine, 177(2), 195-205. doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.7674 Other examples of team approaches are the implementation of honest discussions between caregivers to emphasize compassion as well as organization-wide events to enhance workforce well- being. While Gazelle and Panagioti concluded that organizational approaches were superior to individualized interventions, the final verdict has not yet been reached as Wuest’s combined intervention addressing burnout at the individual, team, and organizational levels might be the key. == References == Category:Physicians Category:Stress (biological and psychological) Category:Occupational safety and health ","title":"Physician burnout"},{"id":"60275505","text":"Heidi Franz (born January 14, 1995) is an American professional racing cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Women's Continental Team . ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:American female cyclists Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Heidi Franz"},{"id":"60275506","text":"Love Station is a 2019 Nepalese drama romance film directed by Ujwal Ghimire.

He has toured with Buddahead and was an original member of Trampled Under Foot. Schnebelen became a solo artist in 2015, and released two live albums the following year. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer stated that Schnebelen offers \\"[e]chos of the blues like Freddie King, Buddy Guy... Nick Schnebelen’s world-class guitar playing leads the way.\\" His latest album, Crazy All By Myself (2019), entered the US Billboard Blues Albums Chart at number 13. ==Background== Trampled Under Foot was an American soul blues and blues rock band. The original trio consisted of the siblings Danielle Schnebelen (lead vocals and bass), Nick Schnebelen (guitars and vocals) and Kris Schnebelen (drums and vocals). The band was the winner of the International Blues Challenge in 2008. Their 2013 album, Badlands, reached number one on the US Billboard Blues Albums Chart. At the 2014 Blues Music Awards, Badlands won the 'Contemporary Blues Album of the Year' category. The band was also nominated in the 'Band of the Year' category. Trampled Under Foot split up in 2015. ==Career== Schnebelen was born in Kansas City, Missouri, United States. His father and mother were both professional musicians. Nick's father, Bob, played in a blues band, whilst his maternal grandmother was a jazz singer, who got to sing with Count Basie. Prior to that, the family's musical heritage dates back to violin players living in Eastern Europe. Schnebelen was educated at Kansas City's Paseo Academy, where he studied both classical music and jazz. In 1997, Schbnebelen moved to Philadelphia and formed a jam band, K-Floor, who played predominately blues music. He later toured for a while with Buddahead. In 2000, he joined his brother and sister as founder members of Trampled Under Foot. When they won the 2008 International Blues Challenge, Nick Schnebelen was granted the Albert King Award as the competition's best guitarist. After the band's demise Schnebelen became a solo artist, and released the first of two live albums in 2016, Live in Kansas City. The second of them, Live At Knuckleheads, Vol. 1, was issued in June 2016, and credited to the Nick Schnebelen Band. On the recording and subsequent promotional tour, Schnebelen shared lead vocal duties with Heather Newman. He continued to play live and attempted to create an amalgam of various blues styles. Schenebelen stated \\"The old school, new school, even Delta. I bring a lot of different styles together.\\" This all paved the way for the recording and release of Schenebelen's debut solo studio album, Crazy All By Myself. The recording was produced by Tony Braunagel, and guest artists on the collection included the harmonica player Jason Ricci, guitarist Davy Knowles, and pianist Mike Finnigan. The songwriting was done by Schenebelen with Gary Nicholson, Jeff Paris and Dave Duncan. Crazy All By Myself was released on March 1, 2019 via Vizztone and included 13 tracks. Musical backing on the recording was provided by Taj Mahal's Phantom Blues Band. Schnebelen started his most recent touring schedule in 2018, which encompassed North America and Europe, performing at music festivals, and the annual Legendary Rhythm & Blues Cruise. He also opened dates for George Thorogood. Schnebelen and his band are currently touring in the US. Mike Finnigan will join for West Coast dates later in 2019. ==Current band members== *Nick Schnebelen *Cliff Moore - bass guitar *Adam Hagerman - drums ==Discography== { class=\\"sortable \\" - !Year !!Title !!Label  US Billboard Blues Albums Chart - ! 2016  Live in Kansas City Vizztone Records  align=center- - ! 2016  Live at Knuckleheads, Vol. 1 Vizztone Records  align=center- - ! 2019  Crazy All By Myself  Vizztone Records  align=center13 - } ==References== ==External links== * *Discography at Discogs.com *Video of live performance *Vizztone profile of Schnebelen Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American blues singers Category:American blues guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:Blues rock musicians Category:Musicians from Kansas City, Missouri Category:Singers from Missouri Category:Guitarists from Missouri Category:Songwriters from Missouri ","title":"Nick Schnebelen"},{"id":"60275583","text":"Melaenae or Melainai () was an ancient town on the island of Thera.

It is a 3D first-person open world exploration and factory building game. As an engineer, the player is dropped onto an alien planet with a handful of tools and must harvest the planet's natural resources to construct increasingly complex factories for automating all resource needs. The initial goal is to build the Space Elevator and begin supplying the company the player works for (Ficsit) with increasingly numerous and complex components for their unknown purposes. The factory-building aspect of Satisfactory has been described as a first- person version of Factorio. Unlike most other sandbox games like Factorio, the Satisfactory world is pre-generated, i.e. every player's map is identical at the start. The world is 30 km2. == Gameplay == The player takes the role of an engineer that has been sent to a planet via a landing pod with orders to \\"colonize\\" it, that is, build a factory complex for FICSIT on a planet; the player has a choice of four starting locations: the Grasslands, the Rocky Desert, the Dune Desert, or the Northern Forest; this affects the availability of resources that the player has easy access to and amount of flat land for building factories. On landing, the player starts by constructing the Hub from the crash pod's parts, the main location from which most other construction they will build extends from. From there, the player works to expand the Hub from one Tier to the next by providing specific components, most which have to be made by gathering local resources such as ores and plant materials with hand tools, using crafting equipment in the Hub to make new tools or equipment, and using that equipment to make the new components. Once all necessary components are supplied to the Hub, it is expanded to the next Tier, giving the player more construction options and new goals. Initially, most of this construction will be by hand with the player traversing to resources directly to collect them, then to stations to make the gear. However, as the player unlocks new equipment, many of these processes can be automated by the introduction of power systems, including nuclear power plants, and through automated resource collection automation and transport like conveyor belts. The ultimate goal of the game is to build enough parts to construct a space elevator and complete phases of the mysterious Project Assembly. Along the way, besides building the automation to build these parts, they must also survive the hazards of the planet they are on, including the flora and fauna associated with it. Various weapons and defensive elements can be constructed alongside the other equipment. ==Sales== Within three months of its release on early access, over 500,000 copies had been sold.

In addition to basketball, he played football, mainly as a safety and wide receiver, and baseball. ==High school career== Oni started playing high school basketball at Viewpoint School in Calabasas, California. He played for the junior varsity team in his freshman season, when he stood and weighed . As a junior, Oni suffered a knee injury that sidelined him for most of the season. The injury hindered his college recruiting because he did not have film to show college coaches before his senior year. Oni stood and weighed by the time he was a senior. He had a breakout final season for Viewpoint, averaging 18 points, 9 rebounds, and 4 assists and being named California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Division 5AA player of the year. At Viewpoint, Oni did not draw interest from NCAA Division I basketball programs and was only recruited by Division III school Williams College, where he committed in the fall of his senior year of high school. However, Williams did not offer enough financial aid for his family to meet the cost of attendance. During his senior season at Viewpoint, Oni attracted attention from Yale assistant coach Matt Kingsley. After watching his highlight video in the spring of 2015, Yale head coach James Jones offered him, and Oni committed to play for the team on July 1, 2015.. However, since Yale admissions were closed, he spent his next season playing for Suffield Academy, a prep school in Suffield, Connecticut, located near Yale University. With Suffield, Oni averaged 17 points, 6 rebounds and 5 assists and earned New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC) Class A player of the year distinction. On February 5, 2016, he scored 52 points with 11 three- pointers versus Wilbraham & Monson Academy at the National Prep School Invitational, breaking his school record and Shabazz Napier's tournament record. Oni was named most outstanding player of the event. He was a nominee for the 2016 McDonald's All-American Boys Game. ==College career== ===Freshman=== Oni made his debut for Yale on November 13, 2016, recording a team-high 24 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 assists in a 98–90 upset win over Washington. In his next game, he posted 13 points, 10 rebounds, and a season- best 5 blocks in an 89–81 victory over Lehigh. Oni claimed Ivy League Rookie of the Week honors in each of his first three weeks with Yale. On February 25, 2017, he scored a season-high 27 points while chipping in 7 rebounds and 4 assists, in a 99–86 win over Dartmouth. By the end of the season, Oni was averaging 12.9 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.7 assists per game. He earned second-team All-Ivy League recognition and was named conference Rookie of the Week on five occasions during the season. ===Sophomore=== Entering the 2017–18 season, the Hartford Courant speculated that the Yale duo of Oni and Makai Mason could be \\"one of the top backcourts in the country.\\" On November 14, 2017, his third appearance in his sophomore season, he led all scorers with 20 points in an 86–54 victory over South Carolina State. Oni erupted for 26 points, his best mark in the season, and recorded team-highs of 7 rebounds and 4 assists on November 25, in a 79–73 loss to Vermont. On February 24, 2018, he flirted with a triple-double in an 83–73 win over Columbia, matching his season-high of 26 points while leading his team with 9 rebounds and 8 assists. Through 29 games, Oni averaged 15.1 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game, leading Yale in all three categories. He tied the school record for three-pointers attempted in a single season, with 184. Oni was a three-time Ivy League Player of the Week, unanimous first-team All-Ivy League pick, and National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) District 13 second-team selection. ===Junior=== Oni (right) skies for a block in December 2018. Oni made his junior season debut on November 9, 2018, scoring 16 points in a 76–59 win over California at the Pac-12 China Game held in Shanghai. On November 21, he posted his first double-double of the season, leading his team with 18 points and 10 rebounds in a 79–70 loss to Vermont. On December 1, Oni scored 29 points and was named game MVP in a 77–73 victory over Miami (Florida) at the Hoophall Miami Invitational. He erupted for 31 points, 9 rebounds, and 4 assists, leading his team in each category, on February 2, 2019 in an 89–68 win over Dartmouth. Oni was the first Yale player to record a 30-point game since Anthony Dallier in 2017. In his next game, a 74–60 victory over Princeton, he posted a career-high 35 points, 12 rebounds, and 3 blocks. Oni scored the most single-game points in school history since Greg Mangano in 2012. He delivered another strong performance on March 1, when he scored 30 points—shooting 9-of-11 from the field—to help Yale defeat Cornell, 88–65, and clinch a spot in the 2019 Ivy league Tournament. By the end of the regular season, Oni was averaging a team-best 17.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game. He was named Ivy League Player of the Year, becoming the third Yale player to win the award. In his junior season, Oni frequently attracted attention from NBA scouts, who visited all of his games to see him play. He was considered a top-50 prospect for the 2019 NBA draft and became the first Ivy League player to be drafted since 1995. In December 2018, Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski predicted that he would be a first-round pick. ==Professional career== ===Utah Jazz (2019–present)=== On June 20, 2019, Oni was selected as the 58th pick of the 2019 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. His draft rights were traded to the Utah Jazz. With the selection, Oni became the first Ivy League men's basketball player picked in the NBA draft since Jerome Allen in 1995 and the first Yale Bulldogs men's basketball player picked since Chris Dudley in 1987. On July 15, 2019, the Utah Jazz signed Oni. He was assigned to the Salt Lake City Stars for the start of the NBA G League season. He scored a season-high 28 points for the Stars in a win over the Memphis Hustle on January 10, 2020. ==Career statistics== ===NBA=== ====Regular season==== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Utah  10  1  10.9  .375  .368  .800  1.7  .4  .4 .2  3.5 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  10  1  10.9  .375  .368  .800  1.7  .4  .4  .2  3.5 ====Playoffs==== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2020  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Utah  2  0  7.0  .500  .250  –  2.0  .0  .5  .5  3.5 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  2  0  7.0  .500  .250  –  2.0  .0  .5  .5  3.5 ===College=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2016–17  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Yale  29  28  31.2  .441  .396  .784  6.3  2.7  .7  1.1  12.9 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2017–18  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Yale  29  26  32.8  .405  .310  .750  6.0  3.6  .9  .8  15.1 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2018–19  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" Yale  29  28  31.0  .441  .371  .793  6.3  3.6  .9  1.3  17.1 - class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\" Career  87  82  31.7  .428  .356  .777  6.2  3.3  .9  1.0  15.0 ==Personal life== At Yale University, Oni was a major in political science.

They were often in conflict with the rulers of Ur III. Several Kings (𒈗, pronounced Šàr, \\"Shar\\", in Akkadian) of Simurrum are known, such as Iddin-Sin and his son Zabazuna. Various inscriptions suggest that they were contemporary with king Ishbi-Erra (1953—c.1920 BCE). ==Conflicts== Several inscriptions suggest that Simurrum was quite powerful, and shed some light on the conflicts around the Zagros area, another such example being the Anubanini rock relief of the nearby Lullubi Kingdom. Four inscriptions and a relief (now in the Israel Museum) of the Simurrum have been identified at Bitwata near Ranya in Iraq, and one from Sarpol-e Zahab in Iran. The Simurrun were regularly in conflict with the Akkadian Empire. The names of four years of the reign of Sargon of Akkad describe his campaigns against Elam, Mari, Simurrum, and Uru'a (an Elamite city-state):Sargon's year-names One unknown year during the reign of Akkadian Empire king Naram-Sin of Akkad was recorded as \\"the Year when Naram-Sin was victorious against Simurrum in Kirasheniwe and took prisoner Baba the governor of Simurrum, and Dubul the ensi (ruler) of Arame\\".Year-Names of Naram-Sin of Agade After the Akkadian Empire fell to the Gutians, the Lullubians and the Simurrums rebelled against the Gutian ruler Erridupizir, according to the latter's inscriptions: At one point, Simurrum may have become a vassal of the Gutians. Simurrum seems to have become independent after the collapse of Ur III.

She began her artistic studies at the School of Arts and Crafts in Granada shortly after the Civil War ended in 1939. Although she initially favored embroidery studies, contact with other students at the school such as painter Miguel Pérez Aguilera and sculptor , who would go on to study fine arts in Madrid, inclined her to prepare her application to the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. In the meantime she worked at a sculpture workshop, creating religious images. She joined the Madrid school for the academic year 1940–41, thanks to her income and a scholarship from the city council of La Zubia. There she studied painting and discovered, with , her inclination for sculpture. In 1944 she married the sculptor (1909–2009).

She is interested in physics beyond the standard model. She leads the silicon detector program for the General AntiParticle Spectrometer (GAPS) and the high-energy X-ray analysis community for the NuSTAR telescope array. == Early life and education == Perez was born and raised in West Philadelphia. She studied physics and mathematics at Columbia University, earning an undergraduate degree magna cum laude. She moved to the California Institute of Technology for her graduate studies, earning a master's in 2008 and a PhD in 2011. She developed the ATLAS experiment pixel detector, and led the first ATLAS measurements of the inclusive cross-section for the production of hadronic jets. Perez returned to Columbia University as a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellow, working in the NuSTAR Galactic Center. During her fellowship she developed outreach activities for the Columbia University Double Discovery Centre. == Research and career == Perez joined Haverford College as an assistant professor in 2015, before moving to Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2016. Her research interests lie in physics beyond the standard model. She leads the detection program for the general antiparticle spectrometer (GAPS), the first experiment that has been optimised to study low energy antinuclei. Perez is interested in anti-deuterons, antiproton-antineutron pairs which may provide evidence of the annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles, a candidate for dark matter. The GAPS detection is particularly novel, including over 1,000 large- area, low-cost lithium-drifted silicon detectors made by Perez, which can monitor exotic atom capture and decay. The GAPS experiment uses long-duration balloons and reaches the upper atmosphere. Alongside her work on GAPS, Perez leads the high-energy X-rays analysis group for the NuSTAR telescope array. NuSTAR has revealed how stellar remnant populations vary as you move from the Galactic Center. This helps Perez identify sterile neutrinos, which could help to explain neutrino oscillation. === Outreach and advocacy === Perez is an advocate for improved diversity in science, and supports students from underrepresented groups to study and research physics. She is concerned that women and people of colour often carry an unnecessary burden in the scientific workplace. She is involved with public engagement through the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, supporting their massive open online course in electricity and magnetism. == Awards and honors == * 2017 Sloan Research Fellowship * 2017 Heising Simons Foundation Fellowship * 2018 MIT School of Science Teaching Prize for Undergraduate Education * 2018 MIT Buechner Special Teaching Award * 2019 Research Corporation for Scientific Advancement Cottrell Scholar Award == References == Category:American astrophysicists Category:American women academics Category:Columbia College (New York) alumni Category:California Institute of Technology alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty Category:Haverford College faculty Category:Dark matter Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Kerstin Perez"},{"id":"60276705","text":"John R.

The case remains unsolved. Lewis was a native of Georgia but a longtime resident of Chicago, and he was the first black political leader of a ward that had been dominated by Jews. He was known for his brash fashion and quick-witted personality, and he lived a luxurious life and was the presumptive future leader of Chicago's black community. He was fondly remembered in his ward decades after his death for his service to the community, and the City Council designated a section of Pulaski Road \\"Benjamin F. Lewis Road\\" in his honor in 1993. Nevertheless, he was notoriously corrupt and there were many possible suspects for his murder. ==Early life== Benjamin Franklin Lewis was born in Macon, Georgia, on December 2, 1909, and moved to Chicago's west side with his family as a child, attending Crane High School and Crane Junior College. He worked for the United States Unemployment Service as a clerk from 1938 to 1941 and served as a second lieutenant in World War II, moving to the 24th ward after the war. He served as a bus driver for the Chicago Transit Authority prior to quitting that job in 1955. He became a precinct captain in 1952, the first African- American one in the 24th ward. ==Tenure as alderman== Chicago's 24th ward encompassed the North Lawndale community area, known locally as \\"Lawndale\\", which was a Russian Jewish stronghold into the 1950s, after which it became predominantly black. Despite the Jewish flight in the 1950s, whites continued to control the ward and fought to retain that control; this was common on Chicago's west side, where such wards were known as \\"plantation wards\\", in contrast to the south side which had black political representation dating back decades. Lewis was working as a city housing inspector when he was elected as the 24th ward alderman to replace Sidney D. Deutsch, who had been appointed City Treasurer and vacated the office on September 24, 1957. Lewis defeated attorney Arthur N. Hamilton, who subsequently petitioned the county court to void the election and either declare Hamilton the alderman or to hold a new election, alleging such irregularities as election judge misconduct and voter bribery. Judge Carl H. Smith dismissed the suit on June 6, holding the complaint to be insufficient, and Lewis took office on April 8, 1958. During his tenure, he courted controversy when he referred clients to his own insurance business despite receiving $50 a month and five percent on commissions of business for referring clients to insurance agent Arthur X. Elrod, Inc. He reached a settlement with Elrod, Inc. in July 1962 in which he promised not to refer clients of Elrod, Inc. to his own business while the contract was still valid. Arthur X. Elrod had been the ward's committeeman prior to 1960. Lewis was the first black alderman of the 24th ward. He often made disparaging remarks towards South Side black leaders such as William L. Dawson. He expressed indifference when asked how he stood on an unsuccessful attempt by Dawson and others to replace 5th ward alderman Leon Despres with a black man: \\"I stand right at Kedzie and Roosevelt in my ward.\\" He was flashy and liked to be called \\"Big Cat\\", and was also known as the \\"Duke of Dixieland\\". He had several mistresses, took vacations in Acapulco, held much real estate, and was known for his flashy wardrobe consisting almost entirely of suits costing at least $200—despite having an annual salary of $8,000. He was also noted for his quick wit, although he was soft-spoken during council business and rarely made a speech. Actual power in the ward was held by Irwin Horowitz during his tenure. Horowitz was a real estate manager living in the Gold Coast. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had called the 24th ward \\"the best Democratic ward in the country,\\" and it continued that reputation in Lewis's time. Lewis was an ardent adherent to the Democratic machine and was selected by Richard J. Daley to become 24th ward committeeman upon Deutsch's death in October 1961. At the start of his tenure, 37 of the ward's 58 precincts had white precinct captains, but Lewis gradually replaced the white captains with blacks; when the white captains complained, Lewis suggested that they go to their respective ward committeemen for patronage positions. At the time of his murder, he had expressed his intention to replace the ailing Thomas J. O'Brien as the congressman representing Illinois's 6th congressional district, and he was widely expected to replace Dawson as the main black political leader in Chicago. ===Murder=== In the early hours of February 28, 1963, Lewis was murdered in his ward office on Roosevelt Road, where he had moved the day before. He had heavily won reelection in the aldermanic election two days previously, defeating his opponent Jeff Clifford Alford 13,189 votes to 888. He was found handcuffed to his desk with cigarette burns on his skin and had been shot three times in the back of the head. The case remains unsolved, but the murder was widely attributed to organized crime at the time. An FBI informant blamed Outfit killers Lenny Patrick and Dave Yaras for the killing, but no charges were ever filed against them. Jimmy Hoffa historian Dan Moldea claimed that the hitman was a friend of Jack Ruby. It was popularly believed at the time that the murder was unsolvable as there were too many suspects given Lewis's activities, a sentiment that was shared by the director of the investigation. An ex-convict boasted about killing Lewis in 1985, but died in a fire before police could question him. After Lewis's death the office of 24th ward alderman remained vacant until future Congressman George W. Collins assumed it on January 21, 1964. ==Legacy== Lewis is the last politician murdered in Chicago as of 2019. According to historian Richard Lindberg, the murder \\"capped off an open lawlessness in the city with regards to its politicians that [had] been going on ... since the time of Al Capone\\". Lewis is also remembered for his contributions to the community. 24th ward alderman Jesse Miller, speaking in 1993, noted that \\"even today, Ben Lewis is considered to have been a stalwart in the community who was a pioneer in making the 24th Ward an independent ward in the city,\\" and successfully petitioned the City Council to designate Pulaski Road between Harrison Street and Cermak Road as \\"Benjamin F. Lewis Road\\". ==See also== *List of Chicago aldermen since 1923 *List of unsolved murders ==References== ==Bibliography== * * Category:1909 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Chicago City Council members Category:Deaths by firearm in Illinois Category:Illinois Democrats Category:Military personnel from Illinois Category:People from Macon, Georgia Category:People murdered in Chicago Category:Unsolved murders in the United States ","title":"Benjamin F.

She became known primarily for her court reports, and as a writer, for her novel Käsebier conquers the Kurfürstendamm (Käsebier erobert den Kurfürstendamm; in translation published under the title Käsebier Takes Berlin). Tergit served as secretary of the PEN-Center of German-language Authors Abroad. Tergit was the mother of mathematician Ernst Robert Reifenberg. == Early life and education == Elise Hirschmann was born in Berlin, 4 March 1894. At the age of 19, she published her first newspaper article in a supplement of the Berliner Tageblatt in 1915. It was a piece on the problems of women in wartime. She interrupted her first attempt at entering the newspaper industry because the press was generally conceived to be no place for young women of upper-class backgrounds. She then studied history and philosophy at multiple German universities, eventually earning her doctorate in 1925 at the University of Frankfurt am Main under the supervision of the historians Freidrich Meinecke and Erich Marcks. ==Career== Starting in 1920, Tergit published in the feuilletons of the Vossische Zeitung and the Berliner Tageblatt. During this time, Tergit became well known to the German newsreading public as a court-room reporter at the Berliner Tageblatt. She was amongst a group of reporters who introduced literary sensibilities to court- room reporting. Articles of her criticizing injustice or reactionary judges were also printed in the journal Die Weltbühne, which was published by Carl von Ossietzky. In 1928, she married the architect Heinz Reifenberg. Her début novel, Käsebier erobert den Kurfürstendamm, appeared in 1932 and made her famous. Due to her critical assessment of processes involving Nazis, a horde of SA-men tried to force their way into her apartment in March 1933. She then flew to Spindlermühle, and later moved to Palestine. From 1938, she lived in London. She had already started her historical novel Effingers which deals with several generations of a German-Jewish family and which is sometimes dubbed the \\"Jewish Buddenbrooks\\". It was published in 1951 but had only limited success at the time of publication. Tergit died in London, 25 July 1982. Posthumously, her recollections, Etwas Seltenes überhaupt, appeared in 1983. A street in Berlin is named after her. == Works == * Käsebier erobert den Kurfürstendamm. Rowohlt 1932, Neuausgaben Krüger 1977, Arani 1988, Das Neue Berlin, Berlin 2004, Berliner Verlag 2007.

Arrests were also broadcast, such as that of Most Wanted No. 21 Xiong Yan. Not all of the 21 most wanted are as well known as Chai Ling or Wang Dan. Others such Zhang Zhiqing have essentially disappeared. After his initial arrest in January 1991 and subsequent release, nothing further is known about his situation and where he lives now. Zhang Zhiqing's role and reason for being listed on the list of 21 most wanted is generally unknown; this is the case for many others on the list such Wang Chaohua. Other dissidents that are not as well known to the public include Zhou Fengsuo and Wang Zhengyun. Zhou Fengsuo was a physics student at Tsinghua University and a member of the Standing Committee of the Beijing Students Autonomous Federation during the protests. Fengsuo was turned in by his sister and arrested on June 13, 1989 in Xi'an. He was imprisoned for one year before being released in 1990 due to international pressures, along with 97 other political prisoners. Leaving China for the United States, he attended the University of Chicago. Steady in his activist roots he co-founded Humanitarian China, an organization that promotes rule of law in China and also raises money for Chinese political prisoners. Wang Zhengyun was a student of the Central University for Nationalities and was the only member of the Kucon ethnicity minority group to be studying at a university. Zhengyun was arrested in July 1989 and released two years later. He was sent back to his village in the Yunnan countryside. In December 1998, Wang was one of 19 dissidents, including Zhai Weimin, who staged a hunger strike to protest the oppression of CDP members and other dissidents. Ma Shaofang and Yang Tao are another pair of dissidents that lack public attention despite their constant activist efforts. Ma Shaofang was a student of the Beijing Film Academy during the protests and turned himself in on 13 June 1989. In October 1990 he was sentenced to three years in prison for counterrevolutionary incitement. In May 1994, he participated with Wang Dan and other dissidents in a petition to the National People's Congress calling for a reassessment of 4 June. He has had issues in attempting to open a business and has had a series of short lived jobs ever since and is living in Shenzhen. Yang Tao, who was at one time the head of Beijing University's Autonomous Student Federation, remains in China today. He was initially charged as being an instigator of the counterrevolutionary rebellion and imprisoned for one year on 16 June 1989. In 1998, he wrote an open letter asking for the release of Wang Youcai. His continued efforts landed him in prison in 1999 after lobbying for the government to reverse the labeling of the protest as a \\"counterrevolutionary rebellion\\". He was originally arrested on charges of \\"incitement to overthrow state political power.\\" However, he was indicted on amended charges of tax evasion on 23 December due to lack of evidence and on 5 January 2003 was sentenced to four years in prison. He was released in May 2003. Yang too has had trouble earning a living. === Aftermath === Each of the 21 students faced diverse experiences after their arrests or escapes; while some remain abroad with no intent to return, others have chosen to stay indefinitely such as Zhang Ming. Only 7 of the 21 were able to escape, the remainder of the 21 student leaders were apprehended and incarcerated. Zhou Fengsuo was turned in by his own sister and arrested on 13 June 1989 in Xi'an. He was imprisoned for one year before being released in 1990 due to international pressures, along with 97 other political prisoners. Some served longer sentences than others, such as Wang Dan, one of the most visible leaders during the protests topping the most wanted list. Wang Dan continued his activist efforts after his parole release and was subsequently sentenced to 11 years for subversion. Liu Gang, who was arrested in Baoding in mid June, attempted to organize his fellow prisoners in defiance, by conducting a hunger strike. He had his arms lashed behind his back in a harsh position for several days while in prison. Many of those who initially escaped from the most wanted list were assisted by Operation Yellowbird and fled to the West. Those who escaped remain in exile today and have opened up about their experiences. Zhang Boli, number 17 on the list wrote a book titled \\"Escape From China\\" that details his experience during the protests and his escape. Those who escaped, whether it was in 1989 or after, generally have had difficulty re-entering China, even up to this day. The Chinese government prefers to leave the dissidents in exile. Those who attempt to re-enter, such as Wu'er Kaixi, have been simply sent back, but not arrested. In 2009, Xiong Yan, number 21 on the list, returned to China with a visit to Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, in order to mark the 20th anniversary the Tiananmen protests. Xiong Yan spent 19 months in jail, after his release he fled to the United States where he keeps in touch with Tiananmen activists and participates in pro-democracy events. Xiong was invited to the southern Chinese enclave by the Hong Kong Alliance, which has been holding annual candlelight vigils on the 4 June anniversary Tiananmen protests. Many of the 21 who are in exile have joined human rights organizations or are now engaging in private business. === Arrests and punishment === The authorities carried out mass arrests. Many workers were summarily tried and executed. In contrast, the students—many of whom came from relatively affluent backgrounds and were well- connected—received much lighter sentences. Wang Dan, the student leader who topped the most wanted list, spent seven years in prison. Many of the students and university staff implicated were permanently politically stigmatized, some never to be employed again. Some student leaders such as Chai Ling and Wuer Kaixi were able to escape to the United States, the United Kingdom, France and other Western nations under Operation Yellowbird that was organized from Hong Kong, a British territory at the time. Smaller protest actions continued in other cities for a few days. Some university staff and students who had witnessed the killings in Beijing organized or spurred commemorative events upon their return to school. At Shanghai's prestigious Jiaotong University, for example, the party secretary organized a public commemoration event, with engineering students producing a large metal wreath. According to the Dui Hua Foundation, citing a provincial government, 1,602 individuals were imprisoned for protest-related activities in the early 1989. , at least two remain incarcerated in Beijing and five others remain unaccounted for.\\"Less Than a Dozen June Fourth Protesters Still in Prison\\" Dui Hua Foundation May 31, 2012 In June 2014, it was reported that Miao Deshun was believed to be the last known prisoner incarcerated for their participation in the protests; he was last heard from a decade ago. All are reported to be suffering from mental illness. == References == == External links == * The Gate of Heavenly Peace – Feature-length Documentary And various archival documents * Secret recordings resurrect Chinese PM's criticism of Tiananmen crackdown – Radio France Internationale * The Tank Man, 2006 PBS documentary * BBC's Witnessing Tiananmen: Clearing the Square with eyewitness accounts of Tiananmen * Tiananmen Square, 1989 The Declassified History * Tiananmen Dossiers and Video Clips (in French) * Official site of Hong Kong \\"Concert For Democracy In China\\" (in Traditional Chinese) * SBS's \\"After 6/4\\" interactive with Western and CPC perspectives on events of Tiananmen Square, 1989 (in English and Simplified Chinese) * Category:1989 protests Category:Protests in China Category:1989 in China Category:1980s in Beijing Category:Conflicts in 1989 Category:Civil rights protests Category:History of Beijing Category:Cold War history of China Category:Mass murder in 1989 Category:Massacres in China Category:Political controversies in China Category:Political repression in China 1989 Category:Student protests in China Category:Tiananmen Square Category:April 1989 events in Asia Category:May 1989 events in Asia Category:June 1989 events in Asia Category:Chinese democracy movements Category:Censorship in China Category:Deng Xiaoping Category:Human rights in China Category:Riots and civil disorder in China Category:Socialism in China Category:1989 in Asia Category:1980s in China Category:20th century in Beijing ","title":"Dissidents in the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests"},{"id":"60277967","text":"Enrico Richino Castiglioni (1914-2000) was an Italian writer, engineer, and architect best known for his unbuilt and frequently unbuildable concepts for buildings.

The economics of terrorism is a branch of economics dedicated to the study of terrorism. It involves using the tools of economic analysis to analyse issues related to terrorism, such as the link between education, poverty and terrorism, the effect of macroeconomic conditions on the frequency and quality of terrorism, the economic costs of terrorism, and the economics of counter-terrorism. The field also extends to the political economy of terrorism, which seeks to answer questions on the effect of terrorism on voter preferences and party politics. Research has extensively examined the relationship between economics and terrorism, but both scholars and policy makers have often struggled to reach a consensus on the role that economics plays in causing terrorism, and how exactly economic considerations could prove useful in understanding and combatting terrorism. ==Introduction== The study of terrorism economics dates back to a 1978 study by William Landes, who conducted research into what acted as effective deterrents for airplane hijackings. Looking at aircraft hijacking trends in the US between 1961 and 1976, Landes found that the reduction in the number of hijackings after 1972 was associated with the introduction of mandatory screening systems, the increased chance of apprehension and harsher criminal penalties. He forecasted that if mandatory screening was not in place, and if the probability of apprehension remained equal to its 1972 value, there would have been between 41 and 67 additional hijacking between 1973 and 1976. Since the attack on the World Trade Center, there have been many more empirical and theoretical contributions that have helped to expand the field. Notably, Alan Krueger and Jitka Maleckova published a paper in 2003 that demonstrated little relationship between poverty and terrorism, in contrast to the common wisdom following 9/11. ===Definition of terrorism=== Scholars and politicians alike have struggled to agree on a universal definition of terrorism.Williamson, Myra (2009). Terrorism, war and international law: the legality of the use of force against Really aj 2001. Ashgate Publishing. p. 38. . Terrorism expert Jessica Stern asserts that \\"the student of terrorism is confronted with hundreds of definitions in the literature.\\"Jessica Stern, Terror In the Name of God: Why Religious Militants Kill (New York:HarperCollins, 2003), xx. However, over this period, scholars dedicated to the study of the economics of terrorism have converged to a standard definition that is frequently used for economic research. It is based on the definition employed by the US State Department, and is primarily used because it uses concrete language, and avoids phrases that create ambiguity in classification, like \\"often\\" and \\"especially.\\" ==Poverty, Education and Terrorism== ===Poverty as cause of terrorism=== President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Great Britain both argued for the causal link between poverty and terrorism in the years following 9/11. For many years, the common wisdom was that poverty and ignorance (i.e. lack of education) was the root cause of terrorist activity. This opinion was once held by politicians across both sides of the aisle in the United States and leading international officials, including George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Shimon Peres, James Wolfensohn, Elie Wiesel, and terrorism expert Jessica Stern. ===Origins of poverty theory=== Alan Krueger has argued that the origins of this common wisdom are an inaccurate early empirical study by Arthur Raper. Using early empirical analysis, Raper (1933) researched the link between the number of lynchings in the south of the United States and the price of cotton, which he used as a proxy for economic conditions. He found a strong negative correlation between the price of cotton and the number of lynchings, and concluded that as economic conditions improve, people commit fewer hate crimes. In 1940, Yale psychologists Carl Holland and Robert Sears cited Raper in a crime economics paper that argued people are more likely to commit violence against others when they are poor. Krueger has alleged that these studies were the beginning of the literature on hate crimes, and the origin of the common wisdom that there is a positive correlation between poverty and terrorism.Krueger, Alan (2007). What makes a terrorist?. Princeton University Press However, subsequent research has rejected Raper's findings. In 2001, Green, McFalls and Smith published a paper that debunked Raper's conclusion regarding the relationship between economic conditions and hate crimes.ibid. By extending Raper's data-set beyond 1929 and running a multiple regression with controls, they found that Raper had merely identified a correlation between the two variables in the time period of his analysis, and that there was actually no meaningful relationship at all between the price of cotton and the number of lynchings. Other studies have also refuted the link between economic conditions and hate crimes. In 1998, Green, Glaser and Rich published a study on the relationship between citywide unemployment and homophobic, racist, and anti-semitic hate-crimes, and found no significant correlation. Swarthmore economists Fred Pryor and Philip Jefferson found similar results in their study on the link between the existence of hate groups and both local unemployment rates and the disparity in earnings between blacks and whites. In accordance with the surrounding literature on the topic, they found no correlation with either. ===Advanced empirical analysis=== After noticing that the terrorists involved in 9/11 were well-educated and wealthy, and noting a lack of evidence for the common claims regarding the relationship between economic conditions and terrorism, many economists decided to conduct research on the economics of terrorism. In 2003, Alan Krueger published a seminal paper that debunked the common wisdom that terrorists are uneducated and poor.Krueger, Alan; Maleckova, Jitka (2003). \\"Education, Poverty and Terrorism: Is There a Causal Connection\\". Journal of Economic Perspectives. 17. By looking at a data-set of Hezbollah militants who died in action from 1982 to 1994 and a fair comparison group from the Lebanese population, he found that Hezbollah militants were better educated than their peers in the population, and less likely to come from poverty.ibid. In the same paper, Krueger cited Claude Berrebi's analysis of Hamas, PIJ and PNA terrorist attacks in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories between 1987 and 2002. Berrebi, in accordance with Krueger's own research, found that Palestinian terrorists and even suicide bombers were both more likely to have attended college than the average Palestinian, and less likely to come from a poverty stricken background.ibid. In fact, 2 of the suicide bombers in Berrebi's data-set were actually the sons of millionaires. From his own and Berrebi's analysis, Krueger concluded that there is little reason to the argument that a reduction in poverty or increase in educational attainment would meaningfully reduce international terrorism. In 2007, Claude Berrebi published a paper looking at the link between education and terrorism among Palestinian suicide bombers, which used an updated data-set that included failed and foiled attacks between 2000 and 2006. His conclusions reaffirmed Krueger's findings: both higher education and a higher standard of living were found to be positively associated with participation in Hamas or PIJ and with becoming a suicide bomber, whilst being married reduced the probability of involvement in terrorist activities. Berrebi also did much to develop the profile of a terrorist from Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, finding that at least 96% of terrorists in his data-set had at least a high- school education, and that 93% were under the age of 34.ibid.' Krueger also investigated the theory that, whilst terrorists may be better educated and wealthier than the population, poor macroeconomic conditions for the country as a whole might drive wealthier citizens to commit acts of terrorism. Contrary to this theory, he found that when one accounts for the fact that poorer countries are less likely to have basic civil liberties, there is no difference between the number of terrorists springing from the poorest or the richest countries.Krueger, Alan; Maleckova, Jitka (2003). \\"Education, Poverty and Terrorism: Is There a Causal Connection\\". Journal of Economic Perspectives. 17. Although studies have demonstrated a positive relationship between income, education and the propensity to be a terrorist, scholars are divided on whether this means that these factors cause someone to engage in terrorist activity. In 2005, Ethan Bueno de Mesquita developed a theoretical model in which he argued that terrorist organisations would choose the most well-educated and experienced volunteers since they would be the most effective terrorists. This theory was supported by a 2007 study, in which Berrebi found that terrorists who are older, wealthier, and better educated are more likely to produce a successful, and deadlier, terrorist attack. Whether the positive relationship between terrorism and income/education is a result of the demand-side of terrorism is uncertain, however, the rise of lone wolf attacks might give way to an opportunity for terrorism research in which the sample of terrorists will not have been filtered by terrorist organisations first. ==Macroeconomic Conditions and the Frequency of Terrorism== Alongside the array of literature that examines the link between individual poverty and the propensity to become a terrorist, there is also research dedicated to the effect of macroeconomic conditions on the occurrence of terrorism. A paper published by Bloomberg, Hess and Weerapana in 2004 examined exactly this using a panel data set of 127 countries from 1968-1991. They concluded that for democratic and high income countries, economic contractions increase the probability of terrorist activity.S.Brock Blomberg, Gregory Hess, Akila Weerapana, Economic conditions and terrorism, European Journal of Political Economy, Volume 20, Issue 2, June 2004, Pages 463-478 However, this study has been critiqued for not separating the terrorist venue country from the terrorist target country in its analysis. In a working paper from 2003, Claude Berrebi addressed this, noting that terrorist attacks would be more likely to be caused by the economic conditions where the perpetrators come from, than where the attack actually takes place. Taking this into account, he found that there was no sustainable link between economic conditions in Gaza and the West Bank, and the frequency of terrorism produced by terrorists from these regions. These findings were supported by Alberto Abadie, who also failed to find a significant association between terrorism and macroeconomic variables once control variables were accounted for. Abadie argued that political freedom has a far stronger, and monotonic, relationship with terrorism, with terrorism peaking in countries that transition from authoritarian to democratic governments. In accordance with these findings, UNC political scientist James Piazza found no significant relationship between poverty, malnutrition, inequality, unemployment, inflation or economic growth and terrorism, but found that ethno-religious diversity, increased state repression, and a large number of political parties are good predictors of terrorist activity. He concluded that this might be a result of the social cleavage theory, which argues that terrorism is a result of deep social divisions in the electorate rather than socio-economic factors. Alan Krueger and David Laitin developed the discussion surrounding the link between macroeconomic variables and terrorism in a 2008 paper that explicitly examined whether economics could explain either terrorists' national origins, or why some countries are targets of terrorism. They found that, controlling for political regime, the national economy is not a good predictor of terrorist origins, but countries that are terrorism targets are those which are economically successful. Whilst the linear relationship between macroeconomic conditions and terrorism has been questioned, recent research has provided evidence that a nonlinear relationship does exist. A paper published in 2016 by Enders, Hoover, and Sandler looked at the relationship between real GDP and terrorism, and developed a terrorism Lorenz curve. They found that the peak terrorism level differed for domestic and transnational terrorism, which they suggested was a result of domestic terrorism being motivated by economic grievances and transnational terrorism being motivated by foreign policy grievances. Consequently, they found that the peak level of domestic terrorism corresponds to a lower real GDP per capita than transnational terrorism. In addition to separating domestic and transnational terrorism in their analysis, they also separated their analysis between two time periods - pre-1993 and post-1993 - to reflect the fact that the nature of terrorism changed in the latter period due to the rise of religious fundamentalism in the Middle East. By doing this, they discovered that before 1993 there was a greater concentration of transnational terrorist attacks from terrorists who come from countries with a higher GDP/capita. Since then the composition of terrorist groups has shifted from leftists to religious fundamentalists, and the link between macroeconomic conditions and terrorism is likely to have changed. Their article offers an explanation for the diverse findings in the literature, which they find to be the assumed linear specification, aggregation of terrorist attacks, and different time periods used, which provide too many confounding and opposing influences. ==Macroeconomic Conditions and the Quality of Terrorism== Political scientist Ethan Bueno de Mesquita has presented a model of terrorism that proposes that the reason why terrorists are normally better educated than the general population is that terrorist organisations screen volunteers for quality. In periods of recession and low economic opportunity, the supply of potential terrorists will increase, and terrorist groups will have a larger pool of highly qualified potential terrorists to choose from. Hence, in these periods of poor economic opportunity, the quality of terrorists will increase, and thus economic recession will be positively correlated with the quality/threat of terrorism rather than the frequency of terrorism. This theory was put to the test in a paper published in 2012 by Berrebi, Benmelech and Klor, which looked at the relationship between economic conditions and the quality of suicide terrorism. They found that although poor economic conditions don't correlate with the frequency of terror, they do correlate with the quality of terror. High unemployment rates allow terror groups to recruit better educated, older, and more experienced suicide terrorists, who are in turn more effective killers, thus increasing the threat of terrorism. Consequently, they support policies to improve economic development since these might reduce the lethality of terrorism. However, they emphasise the importance of paying attention to the ideology of local organisations that aid is administered to, since aid can be used to indirectly increase the frequency of terrorist attacks. ==Timing and Location of Terrorism== A paper published in 2007 by Claude Berrebi and Darius Lakdawalla examined how the risk of terrorism in Israel changes over time. Using a database of Israeli terrorist attacks from 1949 to 2004, they found that long periods of time without an attack signal lower risk of another attack for most areas, but higher risk of another attack in important areas, such as capitals and contested sites (e.g. Jerusalem). In the same paper, they also found that when it comes to selecting targets, terrorists act as rational agents: they are more likely to attack targets that are accessible from their base and international borders, that are symbolic or governmental, or that are in more Jewish areas. A panel data study by Konstantinos Drakos and Andreas Gofas also looked at the profile of a terrorist attack venue (i.e. targets), but for transnational terrorist activity rather than Palestinian terrorist activity. They found that the average terrorist attack venue is characterised by low economic openness, high demographic stress, and high participation in international disputes. They found no strong statistical relationship between the level of democracy and terrorist activity, although theorised that the level of democracy affects how accurately terrorist activity is reported. ==Economic Consequences of Terrorism== ===Macroeconomic consequences of terrorism=== There are two competing views on the impact of terrorism on modern economies. Some scholars have argued that terrorist attacks have a small impact on the economy since they have a negligible impact on physical and human capital (i.e. buildings can be rebuilt, casualties are never that large). This theoretical outlook is supported by the literature on the economic impacts of natural disasters, which has found that natural disasters in modern economies don't often have serious long-term economic effects.Krueger, Alan (2007). What makes a terrorist?. Princeton University Press. Other scholars have argued that terrorism can have big impact on the economy, since if an important area of the economy is hit (e.g. financial sector), the whole economy could face repercussions. There is a wealth of theoretical and empirical work on the effect of terrorism on macroeconomic outcomes.ibid. Theoretically, terrorism endangers life, leading to a reduction in the value of the future relative to the present. Therefore, an increase in terrorism should decrease investment and long run income and consumption. Governments could try and offset the impact of terrorism by spending on security, although it would not be optimal for a government to spend so much as to fully offset the impact of terrorism. Therefore, even an optimising government could not totally nullify the negative impacts of terrorism on the economy. Bloomberg, Hess and Orphanages have found empirically that the occurrence of terrorism has a significant negative effect on economic growth, albeit a smaller and less persistent effect than war or civil conflict. Furthermore, they found that terrorism is associated with a reduction in investment spending and an increase in government spending. They also noted that although terrorist attacks are more frequently found in OECD countries, the negative effect of terrorist attacks on these economies is smaller. In accordance with this study, Abadie and Gardeazabal found whilst analysing terrorism in the Basque Country that the outbreak of terrorism corresponded with a significant decline in GDP per capita in comparison to other similar regions. During the truce negotiations between 1998 and 1999, they found that stocks of firms that operate in the Basque Country improved in performance when truce became credible, and suffered at the end of the cease-fire. In a later 2008 paper, the same researchers found that terrorism reduces the expected return to investment, and consequently lowers net foreign direct investment. They found the magnitude of this effect to be large. ===Terrorism and expectations=== The behavioral intention theory suggests that behavioral dynamics are related to the agent's attention. Terrorism changes people's attention and thus modifies their rational behaviors into more behavioral ones. Microeconomic data related to investment in human capital (education) in Kenya during terrorism support this evidence. Terrorism also changes expert and market forecast performances of inflation and exchange rate, even after controlling for uncertainty or volatility. Exchange rate forecasts are significantly impacted by fatalities caused by terrorism due to their more international effect. ===Terrorism and tourism=== The terrorism effects on tourism arrivals show substitution and generalization effects and confirm the existence of a consumer's short memory effect. Spillover effects of terrorism on market shares and tourism display significant contagion effects of terrorism on market shares, as is evidence of the effect of terrorism on the substitutability between countries. ===Terrorism and the Israeli economy=== Map of Israel, neighbours and occupied territories Israel is a country that has suffered largely from terrorism, and hence provides a good case-study for the impact of terrorism on an economy. A study by Zvi Eckstein and Daniel Tsiddon found that continued terror at the level that Israel experienced in 2003 decreases annual consumption per capita by around 5%. They concluded that if Israel had not suffered from terrorist attacks in the 3 years prior to 2003, their output per capita would have been 10% higher in 2003. Terrorism has also been found to reduce investment in Israel. David Fielding found that there is a strong relationship between the number of people killed in Intifada-related terror attacks and aggregate investment. Violence of all kind reduces investment demand, suggesting that aggressive security measures are less effective than the pursuit of a peace agreement, which would remove the incentive for violent political conflict. Lasting peace would substantially increase investment, Fielding argues. Berrebi, Benmelech and Klor found similar evidence regarding the consequences of terrorism for the Palestinian (i.e. harbouring) in their 2010 paper. They found evidence that a successful suicide terrorist attack leads to 5.3% increase in a district's unemployment, leads to a more than 20% increase in the likelihood that a district's average wages fall in the following quarter, and reduces the number of Palestinians working in Israel from that district. Significantly, they found that these effects are persistent, lasting for at least 6 months after a suicide attack. These results demonstrate that terrorist attacks in Israel harm the Palestinian in addition to the direct damages to the targeted Israeli economy. ===Terrorism and individual choice=== Becker and Rubinstein have theorised that the impact of fear induced by terrorism will vary depending on individuals' capacity to manage their emotions, which is often influenced by economic incentives. By researching the response of Israelis to terrorist attacks during the Second Intifada, they found that the impact of terrorism on the usage of goods and services subject to terror (e.g. buses, coffee shops, clubs) reflects only the reactions of sporadic users. They found no impact of terrorist attacks on demand for these goods and services by frequent users, but a significant impact on casual users. They also noted that suicide attacks that occur during regular media coverage days have a bigger impact than those that occur before a holiday or a weekend, especially amongst less educated families. ===Terrorism and the labor force=== A panel data study has shown that terrorist attacks decrease female labor force participation and increase the gap between male and female labor force participation in a statistically significant way. The greatest effects were found from transnational attacks, and those against government entities. ===Terrorism and fertility=== A panel data study has shown that terrorist attacks decrease fertility, reducing both the expected number of children a woman has over her lifetime, and increasing the probability of miscarriage. ===Terrorism and philanthropy=== Theoretically, net philanthropic responses to terrorism can vary. Some individuals react to terrorism by reducing their charitable activities, whilst others express more generosity by increasing how much they give, either out of empathy with the victims, or out of a heightened sense of patriotism. A paper published in 2016 by Claude Berrebi and Hanan Yonah found that terror attacks considerably increase the amount that individuals and households give to charity, suggesting that the latter response outweighs the former. Higher income individuals donate more, but terrorism reduces their relative generosity, and women and non-married donors appear to reduce their average donations in response to terrorism. It's suggested that those who reduce their donations following terrorist attacks are more sensitive to terrorist-related economic risks. ==Terrorism and Electoral Outcomes== Berrebi and Klor have provided theory about the interaction between terrorism and electoral outcomes. They contend that support for the country's right-wing parties is likely to increase after periods with high levels of terrorism, and decrease after periods without it. They also contend that the expected level of terrorism is higher when a left-wing party is in government than when a right- wing party is in office. In a 2006 paper they tested these theories, and found that the first is strongly supported by public opinion poll data from the Israeli electorate, whilst the second is strongly supported by the terrorism trends under the three Israeli governments between 1990 and 2003. In 2008, the same set of researchers developed the literature on the relationship between terrorism and electoral outcomes by analysing the causal effects of terrorism on Israeli political opinion. They found that the occurrence of a terror attack in a province within three months of an election leads to an 1.35% increase in that province's support for the right-of-centre political parties. This is politically significant in the case of Israel due to the high level of terrorism in the country. Berrebi and Klor also found that a death as a consequence of terrorism can have an impact on electoral outcomes beyond where the attack actually took place, with its impact being stronger if it occurs close to an election. In left-leaning provinces, local terror fatalities increase support for right-of-centre political parties, whilst terror fatalities outside of the province increase support for left-of-centre political parties. They conclude that their analysis provides evidence for the theory that the electorate is sensitive to terrorism, and demonstrates that terrorism polarises the electorate. ==Economics of Counter-Terrorism== Airport security measures have reduced the number of airplane hijackings Terrorism economics is studied in order to mitigate or reduce the threat of terrorism. As such, some of the most applicable literature for public policy purposes comes from research surrounding the economics of counter-terrorism. Walter Enders and Todd Sandler published a paper in 1993 that evaluated the effectiveness of policies designed to thwart terrorism. They found that the installation of metal detectors in airports reduced the number of airplane highjackings, but increased the number of other attacks (e.g. kidnappings and assassinations). Similarly, the fortification of US embassies in 1976 reduced the number of embassy attacks but increased the number of assassinations. From this they concluded that anti-terrorism policies under Ronald Reagan did not lead to any long-term reduction in the threat of terrorism against the United States. They argue that the government should always consider the indirect effects of implementing a policy designed to reduce terror. The effectiveness of assassinating members of terrorist organisations in order to curb terrorism was researched by Asaf and Noam Zussmann in 2006. They theorised that the net effect of assassination on future terrorism would depend on the relative size of two opposing effects: the damage that the assassination of a terrorist does to their organisation's capabilities, and the increased motivation for a future attack in response. Under the assumption that terrorism would negatively impact the Israeli economy, they used the Israeli stock market as an indicator for the effectiveness of a counter-terrorism assassination. They found that the market improved following assassinations of senior military leaders of terrorist organisations and declined following assassinations of senior political figures in terrorist organisations. Consequently, they argue that the assassination of the former is effective, but the assassination of the latter is counterproductive. They also found that the assassination of low ranking terrorists did not significantly impact the stock market. Berrebi, Benmelech and Klor examined the effectiveness of house demolitions as a counterterrorism tactic in a paper published in 2015. They found that punitive house demolitions targeted at Palestinian suicide terrorists result in an immediate and significant decrease in the number of suicide attacks. In contrast, the implementation of curfews and precautionary house demolitions based upon the location of the house result in a significant increase in the number of suicide attacks. They concluded that selective violence can be an effective counterterrorism tool, but indiscriminate violence is not. ==References== Category:Terrorism ","title":"Economics of terrorism"},{"id":"60278055","text":"In U.S. history, carpetbagger was a derogatory term for Northerners who moved to the South after the Civil War.

This carnival is renowned around the world for the diversity and originality of its costumes. Together with the Kourou Carnival and the Saint-Laurent Carnival, it is one of the most important carnivals in the region. This carnival is also known for its parade, the Parade of Cayenne (also called Parade of the Capital), where participate groups invited from Metropolitan France, Suriname, Brazil and Caribbean. == History of the carnival of Cayenne == This festival belongs to the Guianan Creole culture. It originates from the carnival as it is practiced in Europe. At the beginning of colonization, the settlers practiced carnival, but slaves were forbidden. Braving the ban, the slaves practiced the carnival, in clandestine celebrations. They saw it as a way to regain some freedom, to commemorate fertility and harvests like Africans, and to mock the settlers. Today the metropolitan, Brazilian and Chinese communities take part.Le carnaval guyanais ou l’entretien symbolique de frontières « ethniques » sur Manioc It has a variable duration fixed by the religious festivals, it takes place between the Epiphany at the beginning of January, and the Ash Wednesday marking the beginning of Lent calculated according to the date of Easter in February or March. It takes place from Friday evening to Monday morning.Carnaval de Guyane, le carnaval le plus long du monde The gras days close the carnival, it is Ash Wednesday. == Traditional costumes == Touloulous in the streets of Cayenne in 2007. There are several traditional costumes that represent mythical figures of the Guianan carnival. === King Vaval === Mythical figure of the carnival. He is the king of the carnival. He is inducted at the beginning of the carnival. He dies on Ash Wednesday, to be reborn like the Phoenix the following year. === The Touloulou === The most famous of the characters. She is a lady dressed elegantly from head to toe. She wears a petticoat, a hood, a domino mask and long gloves, so that one does not see a centimeter of skin. The goal is that the woman disguising in Touloulou is not recognized. She runs in the street but she also participates in masked balls. She represents the bourgeois women of the 18th and 19th centuries. === Negmarons === These are groups of men wearing a kalimbé (loincloth red and coated with oil and soot. They also have an awara palm seed in the mouth. They seek to put the order (put all the spectators out of the street where the parades take place). They represent fugitive slaves, called chestnuts. === Zonbi baréyé === The zonbi baréyé (or baré yé) or simply \\"zonbi\\" in Guianan Creole is a character appearing a zombie. === the Jé farin === This costume is all white. It consists of pants, a shirt, a pointed hat and a mask. He reminds everyone of a traditional job: the baker. The tradition is that the children play with him, and in response the farin flourishes them. === Bobi === Sometimes referred to as Babi or Bubi, it consists of old bags of local brown jute potatoes that cover the body. He is restrained with a leash. It is a hungry bear, it would be inspired by the first showers of bears. === Karolin === She is a wealthy woman with gold and jewelry worn by her husband on her back. Jealous, she forces him to move like this to protect him from other women. === Lanmò (death) === he is dressed in white from head to toe, his costume makes it possible to envelop the spectators. This character represents death. === Sousouri (the bat) === It is a figure dressed in a right-to-the-body winged from head to toe, usually black or two-colored. Rather maleficent and known for her vampire behavior, she pursues passers-by on the street and \\"spades\\" and tickles sherl'cy. === Djab rouj (red devil) === He's a devil dressed in red and black. It is seen in the streets during mardi gras. === Other costumes === There are also many other costumes, some of which are endangered such as : * the Annglé bannan, * the Sweepers, * the Bèf vòlò bèf, * the Cane cutters, * the Djab annan bwèt, * the Senegalese Tirailleurs, * the Drainer. == The carnival of the streets == Every Sunday afternoon (around 3pm), parades take place in the streets of Cayenne (a little earlier normally). Groups disguised according to the theme of the year, parade around decorated floats, to the rhythm of drums, brass and string instruments. The preparation of the groups last several months before the carnival. The groups parade in front of tens of thousands of delighted spectators who are massing on the sidewalks and the stands arranged for the occasion. The most known groups are: * Kassialata * star apple * Kalajirou * Piraye * Reno Band * Ijakata * Kouman * Chiré Ban'n * Osband * the Belles de la Madeleine * Junior City * Wanted * Mayouri Tchô-NèG * Patawa Folia Brazilian bands, similar to those encountered in the Rio Carnival, are also appreciated for their rhythms and their alluring costumes. The Asian community of French Guiana also participates in the parades bringing its characteristic touch, with dragons. == The carnival of families == Traditional Galette des Rois. Throughout the carnival, families gather to eat the galette des rois. This is the tradition of the slab of kings known in Europe during the Epiphany, extended throughout the carnival period. Usually, the king pays the cake the following week. The cake can be frangipane, guava or coco. After the Abolition of slavery in 1848, the economy of Guyana is stricken, a large number of the population lives from the work of the land in \\"houses\\". People cultivate the land, we know the value of working together: Mayouri. In French Guiana, it is at this time that the tradition of the cake of the kings is born, or more precisely of the \\"makes the bouquet\\". A couple organizes the meal and the party. At the end, he designates the couple who will organize the next meeting by giving him the bouquet. == The par-masked Ball == The parade of touloulous. The Dancings, called \\"Universities\\" organize masked balls during which the men come to dance with the touloulous. Evenings are held on Friday and Saturday nights depending on the municipality. This tradition is peculiar to French Guiana, it exists nowhere else, but there are now dancings on Paris and some cities of France which organize its balls. The Tololos Ball is a recent innovation that has only appeared since the 1990s. During these evenings, the men disguise themselves and take on the role of Touloulous (they invite undisguised women to dance). These evenings are becoming increasingly popular and take place several times during carnival, the most important being the last Friday before the fat days. The carnival dances are the mazurka, the polka, the biguine and the piké djouk. It is the Touloulou which invites the men to dance, they can not refuse.Les bals masqués et leurs danses Only the Touloulous have the right to dance, if an undisguised woman dances, the orchestra stops. The capital has only one university, Nana (Soleil levant). == Carnival Groups == The Blues Stars. There are several carnival groups, the most famous are: * Les Mécènes, who officiate in the hall Polina, their star singer was Bernard Inglis, died in 2002, it remains a pillar of the carnival Guyanese. * Les Blues Stars, who play at Nana (Soleil levant). Their star singer is Victor Clet, known as Quéquette, so popular that his picture was printed on the bottles of Rhum Saint-Maurice during the carnival of 2006.Victor Clet, dit Quéquette * Karnivor, which includes Saul Sylvestre (author, composer) and 18 musicians, Arnaud Champestaing, singer, Nadège Chauvet, singer of the group. At the Lindor ceremony, which rewards the Guyanese artists for their production during the year, the Karnivor group was rewarded with seven Lindor.Les Lindor == The Vids == This expression comes from \\"empty the room\\" ball. These videos always take place in the early hours of Sunday after Saturday night's par- masked ball and aim to train all the dancers outside, in the street, so that all these revelers end up going home. them. Initially, there was also always a Vide after the last group of Sunday's street carnival in the early evening. A crowd of young and old followed a truck on which was installed an orchestra that played the rhythms of the carnival. Unfortunately, some of the videos resulted in violence between gangs of young people from different neighborhoods that had serious consequences. Also, these videos have been banned for a long time. Today the public of the vidés are mainly made up of amateurs of vidés who get up early in the morning to participate in the emptied. == References == == See also == === Related articles === * Carnival in French Guiana * Touloulou * French Guiana === External links === * Category:French Guianan culture Category:Entertainment events in French Guiana Category:Festivals in French Guiana Cayenne Category:Religion in French Guiana ","title":"Carnival of Cayenne"},{"id":"60278278","text":"Franz Jung (2018) Franz Jung (born 1966 in Mannheim) is a German Roman Catholic bishop. == Life == Jung studied Roman Catholic theology and philosophy at Ducal Georgianum in Munich and at Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome.

The event was intended as a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Woodstock Music & Art Fair, a landmark festival that was held on August 15–17, 1969, in Bethel, New York. Just prior to its cancellation, it was announced the event had been reduced from three days to one day. Woodstock 50 was canceled on July 31, 2019, after a series of permit and production issues, venue relocations, and artist cancellations. ==Overview== Artists initially announced for the Woodstock 50 lineup included The Killers, Imagine Dragons, Halsey, Miley Cyrus, Robert Plant, The Raconteurs, Cage the Elephant and Janelle Monáe. The lineup also included several musical acts that had performed at the original 1969 festival, such as Dead & Company (featuring three members of the Grateful Dead), John Fogerty (with Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1969), Santana, David Crosby (with Crosby, Stills & Nash in 1969), Melanie, John Sebastian, Hot Tuna (featuring two members of Jefferson Airplane), Canned Heat and Country Joe McDonald (lead singer of Country Joe and the Fish in 1969). Woodstock 50 and its lineup were officially announced in March 2019 but tickets were not released for sale on a previously scheduled date. In late April 2019, a financial backer claimed the festival had been canceled, which was disputed by organizers. Conflicting media reports ranged from allegations of financial and legal difficulties to an inability to secure proper permits from local officials. In May, a judge ruled that the financiers had no right to cancel the festival, allowing the event to proceed as planned. The festival was to take place at the Watkins Glen International racetrack but in June 2019 the venue announced the event would no longer be held there. The concert's location was moved to Merriweather Post Pavilion in Maryland on July 25. The next day, all of the artists who had been initially announced as part of the festival's lineup were released from their contracts. ==Background== Part of the Watkins Glen International racetrack (pictured in 2014), the original planned venue of the festival. Woodstock's co-creator Michael Lang helped organize Woodstock 50. Since 2014, Lang had been planning to hold a 50th anniversary Woodstock festival in 2019. He began negotiating with Japanese investment firm Dentsu Aegis Network in late 2018 to arrange funding for Woodstock 50. Lang was hired as a consultant by Woodstock 50 LLC, a production company founded by hoteliers Greg Peck and Susan Cronin, and a separate entity from Lang's company Woodstock Ventures. This arrangement was made so Lang could avoid a conflict of interest with Woodstock Ventures, which owns the rights to the Woodstock brand. Woodstock 50 LLC and Lang entered into a partnership with Dentsu Aegis in December 2018, and licensed the rights to use the Woodstock name from Woodstock Ventures. The investment firm was contracted to contribute about $49.1 million to fund the festival, based on Lang's initial estimated attendance number of 150,000 people. In January 2019, Lang confirmed that he would be organizing a fourth three-day Woodstock festival that would take place in August in Watkins Glen, New York. The Watkins Glen International racetrack was chosen as the festival location. In August 2018, a festival organized by the rock band Phish that was to be held at the racetrack was canceled by New York Department of Health officials one day before it was scheduled to begin due to water quality and safety issues following several days of flooding in the Finger Lakes region. Lang said he planned for a separate water supply to be brought into the Woodstock 50 site to avoid these issues. Billboard reported that promoters and agents had tried to persuade Lang to seek another venue because the site was too far away from hotels and was seen as a risky location following the circumstances of Phish's cancellation the previous year. In selecting artists for the festival's lineup, Lang planned to book popular contemporary artists alongside musical acts who had appeared in lineup of the original 1969 Woodstock festival. In early documents, Lang named several potential headliners for Woodstock 50, including Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, Beyoncé, My Morning Jacket, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Phish, Kendrick Lamar, Green Day, and Drake, none of whom would appear in the announced lineup. Lang had also sought Paul McCartney, Billy Joel, and a reunited Led Zeppelin as headlining performers, but with the exception of Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant, none of those artists appeared in Woodstock 50's final lineup. Joan Baez told Rolling Stone she had been approached to perform at the festival but had turned the offer down. The festival's lineup was announced on March 19, 2019. The Black Keys were announced as part of the lineup but pulled out of the festival on April 5 due to a scheduling conflict. Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney later explained that the band decided to cancel because they had just returned from a hiatus, and \\"We realized that we didn’t want our first show back to be in front of 150,000 people in a field without any control.\\" Following the lineup announcement press conference, Dentsu Aegis privately expressed concern that organizers had spent too much money on acquiring artists other than those that had been previously considered. A second Woodstock 50th anniversary event, held at the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts—the site of the original 1969 festival—was also scheduled for August 2019. The lineup for the three-day concert program included John Fogerty and Santana, both of whom were included in the Woodstock 50 lineup, as well as Ringo Starr, Arlo Guthrie, Edgar Winter, the Doobie Brothers, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Tedeschi Trucks Band, and Grace Potter. Lang was not involved with the Bethel concert and filed a cease- and-desist notice against its organizer Live Nation for promoting it as a rival event to his Woodstock 50 festival. The Bethel concerts were held as planned on August 16–18. ==Production issues== ===Ticketing and permit delays=== Tickets for the Woodstock 50 festival were supposed to go on sale on April 22, 2019, but no tickets were made available on that date. At that date, the organizers had yet to receive a mass gathering permit from the New York State Department of Health. A New York state health regulation forbids advertising for large, overnights events that do not have a permit, which delayed the sale of tickets. A mass gathering permit for the festival had been submitted on April 15 but the Department of Health had not approved it at that time. ===First cancellation and change of investors=== On April 29, investors Dentsu Aegis Network announced it was no longer funding the festival and that the event had been canceled. Officials from Schuyler County, New York also confirmed the cancellation. Dentsu Aegis ceased its involvement after the organizers reduced the capacity of the festival grounds from 100,000 people to 75,000 to accommodate campers. Later that day, the festival organizers disputed the cancellation in a statement to the Poughkeepsie Journal and announced they would be seeking a \\"legal remedy.\\" Lang also stated on his Facebook page that, despite the loss of their financial backer, the Woodstock 50 organizers would continue to plan the festival and seek new investors, and the festival would go ahead as planned. Superfly, a production partner of the Woodstock organizers, pulled out of the festival on May 1, also citing changes to the festival's capacity as a reason for its withdrawal. Before their departure, Superfly had estimated 65,000 people as the safest maximum capacity at Watkins Glen, which was a lower estimate than either Dentsu Aegis or Lang had previously considered. Once they received further information of the terrain on the race-track property, they revised their maximum capacity estimate down to 61,000, and stated they would not continue to work on the festival if the festival planned to exceed that number. As result of Dentsu Aegis's withdrawal, none of the scheduled artists were obliged to play at the event because they had contracts through either Dentsu or Amplifi Live rather than the Woodstock promoters. Representatives from two major talent agencies told Billboard Dentsu Aegis' decision may have voided the artists' contracts and it was unlikely their clients would be performing at the festival. Following the company's announcement, Dead & Company removed Woodstock 50 from the tour itinerary on their website. John Fogerty told Rolling Stone he was disappointed by the announcement and surprised the festival had not secured permits sooner, saying. \\"You got the sense there was some shakiness to this whole thing\\". Billboard reported on May 6 that CID Entertainment would be producing the festival and that for the event to proceed, Lang would need about $30 million by May 10 and a mass gathering permit from the New York Department of Health. Lang also accused Dentsu Aegis of illegally removing $17 million from the festival's bank account, blocking the April 22 ticket sale and attempting to cancel the event without his consent. Lawyers for the Woodstock organizers requested an injunction against Dentsu Aegis in a New York court on May 9, seeking the return of the disputed $17 million. Amplifi Live filed a counter-claim against Lang on May 13, arguing they had the right to take over the festival and cancel it due to Lang's contractual breaches and logistical misrepresentation. A judge in New York Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Woodstock organizers on May 15 and found that Dentsu Aegis had no legal right to cancel the festival, allowing the event to proceed. The judge also ruled that the organizers were not entitled to the $17.8 million that had been removed from the festival's bank account. On May 17, Oppenheimer Holdings was announced as the festival's new financial backer. Following the court ruling, Lang announced that three-day passes to the festival would cost around $400 and that a limited quantity of limited single-day passes would be available, a change from earlier plans in which only three-day passes would be sold. ===Loss of original venue=== Watkins Glen International announced on June 10 it had canceled the contract for the Woodstock 50 festival and that the event would no longer be held at the racetrack. The festival had lost its booking at the racetrack because organizers had missed a $150,000 payment. The same day, CID Entertainment announced it would also be pulling out of the festival. A representative for the festival subsequently told Associated Press the organizers were in talks with another venue to host the event. In late June, the Woodstock organizers applied for a permit to hold a smaller festival at Vernon Downs horse racing track in Vernon, New York. The organizers were refused the permit on July 9. The organizers' third appeal was denied by the Vernon planning board on July 16. ===Relocation to Maryland and loss of artist lineup=== The festival was to be held at the Merriweather Post Pavilion (pictured in 2017) in Columbia, Maryland. Bloomberg News reported on July 25 that the Woodstock organizers had moved the festival to Merriweather Post Pavilion, a venue with a smaller capacity than either of the planned New York sites, in Columbia, Maryland. Known as \\"Woodstock 50 Washington\\", the festival would act as a fundraiser for non-profit organizations involved with voter registration and climate change. Instead of being a ticketed event as originally planned, the festival would be free and concertgoers would be encouraged to donate to charitable causes. Seth Hurwitz, co-founder of Merriweather Post Pavilion operator IMP, said his venue would host the festival if organizers presented them with a lineup. A concert headlined by The Smashing Pumpkins was scheduled to take place at the venue on August 17. Woodstock 50 would have been reduced from three days to one. Jay-Z and John Fogerty withdrew from the Woodstock 50 lineup shortly after the move to Maryland was announced. On July 26, the promoters released all of the remaining artists on the lineup from their contracted appearances at the relocated festival. The organizers informed artists of the relocation and contract release in a letter that also requested they still perform at the festival and reminded them of the payment they had received from Dentsu Aegis. In the following days, Dead & Company, Country Joe McDonald, John Sebastian, Santana, The Lumineers, The Raconteurs, Pussy Riot, and Miley Cyrus announced they would not be appearing at the relocated festival. Several artists withdrew because they had already scheduled other concerts in the Mid-Atlantic region around the festival weekend and the relocation to Merriweather Post Pavilion conflicted with the radius clauses for some of those events. A representative for The Zombies told Variety that the band still planned to perform at Woodstock 50. On July 30, 17 days before the festival's planned start date, Woodstock 50 organizers had not submitted a permit application to hold an event at Merriweather Post Pavilion. ===Final cancellation=== On July 31, the organizers of Woodstock 50 announced the cancellation of the event. In a press release, representatives said, \\"unforeseen setbacks made it impossible to put on a festival we imagined with the great line-up we had booked and the social engagement we were anticipating\\". Lang told media he blamed Dentsu Aegis for the festival's failure and that he was considering further legal action against the firm. Despite the cancellation, Lang said he hoped to hold a smaller fundraising event at Merriweather Post Pavilion in late 2019 but was not sure it would bear the Woodstock name. In June 2020, the organizers of Woodstock 50 filed a lawsuit with the New York Supreme Court against Dentsu Aegis and Amplifi Live. In the suit, the organizers accused the two firms of sabotaging the event by announcing its cancelation in April 2019. ==Planned line-up== Each artist on the Woodstock 50 lineup was paid an advance and the remainder of the payment was held in escrow until performance or the cancellation of the festival. Alongside the official announcement that the event would not proceed, the organizers suggested the artists donate at least 10 percent of their earnings to HeadCount, a non-profit organization that promotes voter registration.

It serves as the basis for many modern cocktails, and several different versions of the original exist. These are generally distinguished by the accompaniment of either Maraschino or Curacao, as well as differences in gin or bitters. ==History== The true origin of the Martinez cocktail is unclear. Two early stories attribute the making of a cocktail named the Martinez to bartender Jerry Thomas at the Occidental Hotel or by a bartender by the name of Richelieue who worked at a saloon in Martinez, California. Both stories are difficult to verify because records of drinks at the time are missing or incomplete, but the 1887 edition of Thomas' The Bar- Tender's Guide includes a recipe for the Martinez. It calls for a pony of Old Tom gin, a glass of vermouth, two dashes of Maraschino, and a dash of Boker's Bitters with ice, garnished with a slice of lemon. A 1884 drink guide by O.H. Byron released just a few years earlier also listed a recipe for a cocktail called the Martinez by saying only: \\"Same as Manhattan, only you substitute gin for whisky.\\" The book contained two recipes for a Manhattan, one of which called for 2 dashes of curaçao, 2 dashes of Angostura bitters, 1/2 a wine- glass whisky and 1/2 a wine-glass of Italian vermouth. A later 1888 guide by Harry Johnson, the New and Improved Illustrated Bartender's Manual, listed a drink that may have been incorrectly spelled as the \\"martine\\", without the letter \\"z\\". Over time the alcoholic drinks further evolved regarding both their ingredient construction and names to become what were eventually considered as two different cocktails, the Martinez and the Martini. ==Martinez ingredients== After Jerry Thomas' recipe for the Martinez, as well as Byron's, ingredients for the drink that would retain the name Martinez began to take more firm shape, with most variations based on differences between the use of maraschino or curaçao. The Old Mr. Boston Official Bartender's Guide called for 1 oz dry gin, 1 oz french vermouth, 1/4 tsp curaçao, and a dash of orange bitters. In the 1940 The Official Mixers Manual by Patrick Gavin Duffy the drink calls for gin, dry vermouth, orange bitters, and \\"4 teaspoons Curaçao or Maraschino\\". In 1947 Trader Vic called for 3/4 oz gin, 3/4 oz french vermouth, 1/2 tsp orange bitters, and 1/2 tsp curaçao. Difford's Guide lists several versions, including an \\"Old Tom\\" version with Old Tom gin, maraschino, and angostura bitters, a \\"London Dry\\" version with dry gin, maraschino, and angostura bitters, and an \\"Orange\\" version with dry gin, curaçao, and orange bitters. == References == Category:Cocktails with gin ","title":"Martinez (cocktail)"},{"id":"60278683","text":"The 1912 TCU Horned Frogs football team represented Texas Christian University (TCU) in the 1912 college football season.

Montreal Gazette, March 21, 1989. Rose studied nursing, and as a person living with AIDS, he wanted to found a Montreal chapter of ACT UP. ==Murder== On March 19, 1989, he and a friend were travelling on a Société de transport de la Communauté urbaine de Montréal (STCUM) night bus returning to his home in an HIV/AIDS hospice. Rose, who was slight in build and disabled by AIDS symptoms, and who dyed his hair pink, was set upon along with the friend by a group of four youths shouting homophobic slurs.\\"Pink hair and leather cost Joe Rose his life\\". Edmonton Journal, March 22, 1989. They beat and stabbed him to death inside the bus. His friend suffered minor injuries; when emergency personnel arrived, they found him trying to resuscitate Rose. Three minors, aged 14, 15, and 15, and Patrick Moise, aged 19, were ultimately charged and convicted in Rose's death. The youths were sentenced to varying terms in youth custody;\\"Boys guilty in Montreal bus killings\\". Toronto Star, July 9, 1989. Moise was sentenced to 7 years in prison.\\"Man jailed for killing gay activist\\". Windsor Star, March 7, 1990.

Its first public activist event was a \\"die-in\\" protest commemorating the first anniversary of Rose's death.\\"Symbolic death ritual\\". Montreal Gazette, March 20, 1990. A Montreal chapter of Queer Nation was also founded under the name Queer Nation Rose, both as a way of making the name bilingual and as a tribute to Rose.\\"Candles burn to mourn gay activist; Vigil on Tuesday marks anniversary of Joe Rose's death\\". Montreal Gazette, March 16, 1991.

Montreal Gazette, July 31, 1990. An ACT UP meeting held in response led to the formation of multiple community groups that formed the foundation of the LGBT rights movement in Quebec over the ensuing decades, including the holding of Quebec Human Rights Commission hearings about homophobic violence in 1994 and the introduction of benefits for same-sex partners in 1999. The Etcetera association at Dawson College honoured Rose with a commemorative plaque in 2013, and the 30th anniversary of his death was commemorated in 2019. ==Cultural depictions== Rose's murder was the inspiration for John Wojewoda's theatrical play Swarming, which premiered at the Montreal Fringe Festival in 1993.\\"Play's statement about gay-bashing is angry, disturbing and explicit\\".

After developing an interest in Marxism and involving himself in left-leaning student politics at the University of Cape Town and subsequently switching courses from business science to sociology in 1971, he met Jenkin in a sociology class. They soon became friends and both of them sought out the literature banned by the apartheid government, devouring, photocopying it and swapping it with other students. They both found their sociology course disappointing, as the material reinforced the status quo of the apartheid system. As they started realising the full extent of the unfair system of apartheid, they were fired with a desire to work towards change. Coming to the conclusion that they could not effect any real change within the constitutional framework, which banned all effective and truly democratic opposition, they decided that the ideals of the African National Congress (ANC) were worth fighting for. The only way they could work for this banned organisation was to move to the UK and make contact with the organisation there, so both set off in February 1974 by ship via Barcelona, spending a few weeks in the Netherlands en route. Upon arrival in London in April 1974, they applied to join the ANC. While the ANC were checking their credentials, Lee went worked as a carpenter in the Netherlands and taught English in Spain. At the end of 1974, the ANC informed him that they had been approved and, after receiving some months of training with them, could return to South Africa to do something for the movement. During this time Lee worked as a bus conductor and joined the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU). After their return to Cape Town in July 1975, Lee and Jenkin bought a typewriter, duplicator and stationery to print and post pamphlets and leased first a garage and then a tiny apartment. In March 1976 Lee decided to go to Johannesburg to look for work, and the ANC coincidentally sent them both on their first mission, to disperse leaflets urging support for the ANC and unity in the liberation struggle via a leaflet bomb in Johannesburg, close to the anniversary of the Sharpeville Massacre. After achieving this mission, Lee worked for the University of the Witwatersrand, while Jenkin ran the \\"cell\\" on his own in Cape Town. Not long after the Soweto uprising, Lee planted a number of leaflet bombs around Johannesburg. In December 1976, Lee went to Cape Town and both he and Jenkin planted leaflet bombs in the city and suburbs. In Jenkin's words, \\"The actual message on the leaflets, important as it was, was not as important as the fact that the ANC had done it. It is because of the propaganda effect...\\". In June 1977 Lee distributed several caches of leaflets at a right-wing sociology conference in Johannesburg. In September, he and Jenkin hung a 10-metre-long banner with the words \\"ANC LIVES\\" from a high building in the centre of Cape Town, along with a timed device which distributed hundreds of leaflets over the crowds below. Lee moved back to Cape Town in December after enrolling in a master's degree in sociology, and the two continued their undercover work, but unbeknownst to them they were by this time under surveillance by police. ===Arrest=== At 3am on 2 March 1978, they were both arrested, after being seen moving their printing equipment into their own dwelling. They were separated, interrogated and put into cells, without being informed of the charges or their rights. This was legal under Section 6 of the Terrorism Act, which allowed detention without trial for up to 60 days, and was extendable. Lee made an escape attempt and nearly succeeded. After a spell in the notorious John Vorster Square in Johannesburg, they were returned to Cape Town and after four weeks, allowed to see family, and held at Pollsmoor Prison as they awaited trial. After Lee's father brought him a copy of the book Papillon, the book inspired them to seriously consider the prospect of escape and they concentrated on rigorous observations of the world around them. ===Trial=== Along with Jenkin, Lee was tried in the Cape Town Supreme Court from 6 to 15 June 1978, charged with helping to produce and distribute pamphlets for the ANC and South African Communist Party (SACP), and/or participating in ANC, SACP and Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) (all banned organisations in apartheid South Africa) activities. They received poor legal advice and were not allowed to make their own pleas in answer to the charges. Lee's family had insisted on using a different defence lawyer, and he and his witnesses – parents, a Roman Catholic chaplain and a family friend – used the line that Jenkin was the ringleader and Lee had been corrupted. Lee was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment and Jenkin to twelve. ===Prison=== They were first taken to Pretoria Central Prison for assessment, where they were assigned to Pretoria Local Prison (aka Pretoria Prison) to serve out their sentences. This was a separate prison, one of three along with Pretoria Central proper and \\"Maximum\\" or \\"Beverly Hills\\" which were part of the complex - although all three were often referred to mistakenly as Pretoria Central. Within this prison, they were assigned to the maximum security part reserved for white male political prisoners, making the number up to 11 at that time. From the first day, they were observing their surroundings and weighing up the chances of an escape. ===Escape=== Lee, Jenkin and Alex Moumbaris escaped from Pretoria Prison in 1979, after meticulous planning and trial runs. The escape is described in great detail by Jenkin's book, Escape from Pretoria (1987, 2003). Although Jenkin and Moumbaris contributed most towards the preparations for and material necessities of the plan, Lee was firmly behind their thinking and assisted in whatever ways he could. After escaping, Lee separated for some weeks from the others, staying with friends in Johannesburg before meeting up with them again at Luanda airport to fly out of Angola. ===Life after prison=== Lee and Jenkin appeared at a press conference in Lusaka, Zambia with Oliver Tambo on 2 January 1980 to tell their stories. After flying to Tanzania, Lee flew on to London on 13 January 1980, having renounced his South African citizenship soon after arrival in Pretoria. In May 1980 the warden who had been on duty of the night of the escape, Sergeant Vermeulen, was put on trial for \\"aiding terrorists\\", or alternatively aiding in the escape of three prisoners. Lee, having first written to a newspaper explaining Vermeulen's innocence, upon request sent a sworn statement to his defence attorney stating Vermeulen's innocence. The combination of this and the many inconsistencies in his forced \\"confession\\" led to his eventual acquittal. Lee and Jenkin went on a speaking tour in Sweden in the early 1980s. ==In TV and film== In 2013, the story of the prison escape was dramatised in the 7th episode of the 2nd season of Breakout, a television series made by National Geographic TV channel dramatising real-life prison escapes. The video features excerpts from interviews with Jenkin, Lee, Moumbaris and Goldberg filmed in 2012, in between re-enacted scenes of the prison escape. In May 2017, it was announced that production would start on a film of Jenkin's book, produced by David Barron and starring Daniel Radcliffe as Jenkin and Ian Hart as Goldberg. Filming of Escape from Pretoria began in Adelaide, South Australia, in March 2019, with Daniel Webber joining the cast as Lee. ==References== ==Cited works== * Category:Escapees from South African detention Category:University of Cape Town alumni Category:White South African anti-apartheid activists Category:Umkhonto weSizwe personnel Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Stephen Lee (South African activist)"},{"id":"60279012","text":"Prunus spicata is a species of Prunus native to the islands of Borneo (Malaysia) and Luzon (Philippines).

His parents were teachers. Simić graduated from the Military Academy in Belgrade and took an active part in the May Coup in 1903. From 1911 he was the supervising officer of the Vranje border region and the Ottoman Empire. He was a liaison officer in touch with Chetnik Voivode Vojislav Tankosić in Macedonia with the task of transferring arms and men across the border to Turkish-occupied territory. In August 1912, he joined a secret society called the Black Hand. During the First World War, he was a company commander. In 1916 he travelled to Imperial Russia, wherein Odessa he was in charge of recruiting soldiers for the Serbian army from the Austro- Hungarian prisoners and taking part in the establishment of the First Serbian Volunteer Division.In the Salonika trial of Black Hand participants in the May Coup, Simić was sentenced to 18 years in prison in absentia, which is why he remained in Russia and after the October Revolution where he became a Colonel in the Red Army. He remained in Russia until 1936 when he returned to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. There he was arrested at the border, questioned, but managed to convince the authorities that he was not a spy, he was released from detention after two days. He was given back the rank of colonel which was taken away from him at the Salonika trial in 1917. Simić was in touch with General Dušan Simović, with whom he met on 26 March, the day before the Yugoslav coup d'état took place, and informed him about the Soviet Union's mood to conclude an agreement with Yugoslavia. In the Government of Dušan Simović, he was appointed minister without portfolio. As a minister without portfolio, he and Dušan Simović participated in negotiations with Stalin, and immediately after the military coup d'état on 27 March 1941, Mustafa Golubić, the senior NKVD officer and Božin Simić travelled together from Belgrade to Moscow to attend the signing of the Yugoslav-Soviet Union Friendship Agreement. German forces invaded the country ten days later. During the Second World War, Božin Simić, as Minister of the Government-in-exile in London, opposed the bombing of Belgrade by the Allies, because in Serbia a movement of resistance to the occupying forces was afoot from the start, for example, not bombing Bulgaria, which has openly shifted to the side of the axis force. After that, Sofia was bombed for several days. Because of this stance in 1946, on his way to Ankara to take over the position of Tito's first ambassador there, an attempted assassination was made by a Bulgarian agent, but he survived. He died on 24 February 1966, in Belgrade. He was 85. == References == Category:1881 births Category:1966 deaths ","title":"Bozin Simić"},{"id":"60279029","text":"Alcha () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Krasnoyarsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

It was built in the late 1970s largely underground, on the site of the university's football stadium, with a replacement Astroturf field installed on top of it. The four-level, 142,000-square foot facility includes several racket courts, basketball courts, a 200-meter jogging track and 25-meter, eight-lane indoor swimming pool, along with exercise rooms, weight rooms, locker rooms, saunas and a half-acre dance area. The facility was named for the Rev. Gerard F. Yates, a Georgetown faculty member. Problems with the unusual roof arrangement — including torn artificial turf, pooling rainwater and interior leaks — have led to major renovations in 1987, 2002 and 2019, and periodic calls for Yates to be replaced. Because of problems with the playing surface, varsity teams have not used the rooftop Kehoe Field since 2002, and even intramural and recreational users were barred from the roof in 2016. == Construction == In the mid-1970s, Georgetown sought to expand student and faculty opportunities for recreation, training and fitness, and relieve overcrowding on the varsity sports fields and at McDonough Gymnasium. Planners found it difficult to find the space on campus, or acquire new land adjacent to campus, that they would need for such a large facility. The solution was to dig up Kehoe Field, the varsity football stadium on campus, and build the field house underneath. While under construction, Yates was known on campus as the \\"Rec-Plex\\". In addition to saving the cost buying land for a campus expansion, the underground location was also projected to cost 30% less to heat and cool than an aboveground structure. Kehoe Field had hosted varsity and intramural sports at Georgetown since 1956. During the construction, the football team played its 1977 and 1978 home games in the outfield of the baseball field, in a natural bowl on the present-day site of the Georgetown business school's Rafik B. Hariri Building. After two years of construction, the $7.5 million fieldhouse opened July 30, 1979, eight months behind schedule. The rooftop football field, which retained the name Kehoe Field, was ready in time for the 1979 season. == Renovations == By the time the facility was a decade old, roof problems were already commonplace. Rainwater did not drain properly, resulting in the need for $1.8 million in repairs in 1987 and $7 million in repairs in 2002. The Hoyas were forced to move most of their scheduled home games of the 1990 season to opponents' sites, as the university struggled to repair bubbling and cracking in the 400-meter outdoor running track that surrounded the football field. For the 2002 season, the football team moved to what was then Georgetown's soccer stadium, Harbin Field, ending Kehoe Field's use for varsity sports. Harbin Field was later redeveloped into what is now known as Cooper Field. Kehoe Field continued to be used as the home of intramural and club sports until 2016, when a recurrence of the longstanding drainage problems led to the outdoor facility again being deemed unsafe, forcing Georgetown student groups to rent off-campus fields. In 2018, the university unveiled plans to restore Kehoe Field as an intramural sports field and recreation area. ==References== Category:Georgetown Hoyas Category:Georgetown University buildings Category:Sports venues completed in 1979 Category:Athletics (track and field) venues in Washington, D.C.

At the end of the 30s, Bruno arrives in Argentina, in order to avenge Torcuato's treachery and rescue his sister Julia, who fell into the clutches of a pimp. Bruno gets asylum in a typical conventillo in Buenos Aires and from there he begins to plot his revenge plan. However, while plotting his plan, Bruno falls madly in love with Lucía Morel, the young and beautiful fiancée of Torcuato Ferreyra. Lucía is an intelligent, feminist and sensitive young woman who only agrees to marry Torcuato at the insistence of her vile mother to get money for the operation of her father, who is sick with tuberculosis. Meanwhile, Aldo, a good-hearted hustler who is dedicated to convincing Spanish immigrants to embark towards Argentina under the pretext of being the land of opportunities, will do his best to rescue a young and beautiful Polish girl, Raquel, from the brothel where Julia is.

She married the entomologist O.W. Richards in 1931. From 1932 to 34 she studied the biology of the stored grain moth Ephestia. In 1945 Boris Uvarov was looking for a researcher to work at the Anti-Locust Research Centre that he directed. Norris applied and was recruited. Her research from 1945 was on locusts and much of it was focused on chemical ecology. She examined the role of chemicals in aggregation and locust development and maturation. In 1954 she demonstrated the first primer pheromone in insects. She joined her husband on expeditions in 1937 to British Guyana and to the Matto Gross in 1968.

In February 2020 he was sentenced to nine months in federal prison, and to pay a $750,000 fine and serve 500 hours of community service, for his participation in the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal. ==Early life== Hodge was born in New York, New York, and grew up in suburban Boston and Connecticut.\\"An interview with Douglas Hodge of PIMCO,\\" McKinsey on Investing, Winter 2014/15.

Hodge initially worked for the company as a senior account manager and as a global product manager. He was in charge of the Asia-Pacific region from the company's Tokyo office from 2002 to 2009. In 2009, CEO Mohamed El-Erian named Hodge chief operating officer, telling him—according to Hodge: \\"You're the person I trust.\\" Hodge was chief operating officer from 2009–2014. In October 2012 he gave a speech at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Annual Meeting, entitled \\"Restoring Trust in the New Normal\\", in which he lamented that the financial industry had squandered the trust of the public with a series of scandals in the industry, with some in the industry having been guilty of \\"downright dishonesty\\".Douglas Hodge (23 October 2012). \\"Restoring Trust in the New Normal,\\" Remarks to SIFMA Annual Meeting, Viewpoint.

In 2014 it was reported that he had received an annual bonus of $45 million.\\"Pimco paid billionaire Gross $290 million bonus in 2013,\\" Investment News, 14 November 2014. He was also on PIMCO's executive committee, and on the global executive committee for Allianz Asset Management, the governing body of asset management for the Allianz Group. He retired in 2017. He also served as an executive committee member and on the Board of Directors of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). He was also a board trustee of The Thacher School in Ojai, California, since 2011, until March 15, 2019, when the school's Board of Trustees asked for his resignation. ==College admissions bribery scandal== In March 2019 Hodge appeared in US federal district court in Boston to face charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services fraud, asserting that he allegedly paid over a half a million dollars in bribes so that three of his children would be admitted into Georgetown University and the University of Southern California (USC), as part the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal. He did not enter a plea. He was released on $500,000 bond. Assistant US Attorney Eric S. Rosen told the court Hodge was a flight risk with “unlimited resources,” and facing a maximum prison term of 20 years if convicted. The allegations detailed how Hodge paid entities controlled by William “Rick” Singer (who has entered a guilty plea admitting that he was the ringleader of the scheme) and corrupt school officials, to bribe coaches and college officials to get them to present Hodge's children as sports team recruits, despite them not having the requisite athletic ability. Recruits had a better chance of being admitted, as compared to non-recruits with similar academic credentials.Laura Smith, Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation (11 March 2019). \\"Affidavit in Support of Criminal Complaint\\". According to an FBI affidavit, Hodge first began paying Singer in 2008, when he wanted to have Georgetown University admit one of his daughters. Hodge's daughter then submitted an application to Georgetown asserting she had won a number of United States Tennis Association (USTA) tournaments, while in fact she had never played in a USTA match. The daughter was accepted to Georgetown with assistance from the tennis coach, who is now also being criminally charged, and she never played tennis at the university. According to the affidavit, in 2013 Hodge used Singer again, this time to help another daughter get into USC. She was falsely presented to a USC committee as a soccer recruit who had played on a national champion tournament team, was co-captain of a Japanese national team, and was an All-American. She was admitted into USC, but did not ever play soccer. Also according to the affidavit, in December 2014 Hodge asked Singer by e-mail if his son, who was in high school, was “really qualified” for USC. He added: “He would go there in a heartbeat!!” Singer responded: “No but I can try to work a deal ... maybe Basketball or Football will give me a spot since their kids are not that strong.” The next month Hodge's wife e-mailed Singer that she could not find photos of the son playing football, but had pictures of his brother playing football. Singer forwarded the note to a then-USC assistant soccer coach (who is now criminally charged), writing: “See below — I am sure there is a tennis one too. The boys look alike so I thought a football one would help too?” Two days later, Hodge e-mailed a different USC athletic department official (who is now criminally charged): “We are preparing [my son's] 'sports resume' as you requested and should be able to send it on to you early next week.” His athletic profile during the admissions process stated falsely that he played varsity football as a sophomore through his senior season, was the varsity team's captain, and that he had twice been a New Hampshire “Independent Schools All-American Selection,” when in fact he had only played freshman football. The son was admitted to USC as a purported football recruit, but never joined the football team. Singer wrote to Hodge in an e-mail: “Obviously we have stretched the truth but this is what is done for all kids. Admissions just needs something to work with to show he is an athlete,” the affidavit said. Also according to the affidavit, in August 2018 Hodge called Singer to ask about getting his youngest son into Loyola Marymount University. The FBI had a court-ordered wiretap, and listened in, as Hodge told Singer: “We don't have to talk in code. We know how this works.” According to the affidavit, in November 2018 in a taped call Singer told Hodge that his charitable foundation was being audited. Hodge assured Singer that “I'm not going off script here... That foundation has — its stated mission is to help underserved kids basically get into — you know, through — get through college. And that's all I'm going to say.” he paid a total of $850,000 to Singer. The charges provide for sentences of a maximum of 20 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $250,000 or twice the gross gain or loss, whichever is greater. He pleaded guilty in October 2019 to conspiring to commit fraud and money laundering. In February 2020 he was sentenced to nine months in federal prison, and to pay a $750,000 fine and serve 500 hours of community service, as a result of the charges. He is imprisoned in the Federal Correctional Institution, Otisville with a release date of 03/21/2021, and his inmate number is 01457-138.

The case concerned a law passed in Michigan which divided the state into separate congressional districts and awarded each of the state's electoral votes to the winner of each district. The suit was filed by several of these electors chosen in the 1892 election, including William McPherson, against Robert R. Blacker, the Secretary of State of Michigan. It was the first Supreme Court case to consider whether certain methods of states' appointments of their electors were constitutional. The Court, in a majority opinion authored by Chief Justice Melville Fuller, upheld Michigan's law, and more generally gave state legislatures plenary power over how they appointed their electors. The Court held that Article Two of the United States Constitution also constrains the ability of each state to limit the ability of its state legislators to decide how to appoint their electors. ==Impact in Bush v. Gore (2000)== The ability of states to determine the selection and apportionment of their electors was later reaffirmed in another Supreme Court case, Bush v. Gore (2000).

Michie's work is often in dialogue with the canon of collage; as well as, investigating society's understanding of race, gender, sexuality, and other fields of identity and power. ==Early life and education== Troy Michie was born in El Paso, TX. He received a BFA from the University of Texas at El Paso in 2009 and an MFA from the Yale School of Art in Painting/Printmaking in 2011. ==Career== Michie participated in the Tuesday Night MFA Lecture Series at BU School of Visual Arts. === Fat Cat Came To Play === On December 3rd, 2017, Michie held his first solo exhibition Fat Cat Came To Play through Company Gallery, which lasted until January 21st, 2018. In the solo exhibition, Michie explores the significance of zoot suits, which are “broad- shouldered suits that were popular with Italian, black, and Latino men in the United States in the 1940s”. The installation was inspired by the Zoot Suit Riots, which took place in 1943 after white servicemen attacked a group of Mexican Americans wearing Zoot suits. Unlike his earlier works, which dealt with sex, Fat Cat Came To Play focused on exploring “blackness, queerness, and sexuality within an assemblage” by expressing socio-economic traits on to the Zoot Suit. In many of his installations, Michie cuts out the faces of photographs from this era to address that these histories of the minorities are still relevant today. A notable piece of the exhibition was “Disruptive Patterns”, which aimed to remind people that police officers were among the attackers in the Zoot Suit Riots. The exhibition stayed true to Michie’s philosophy of representing the cultural expressions, specifically through fashion, of “historically marginalized American male figures”. ==Exhibitions== *\\"Found: Queer Archaeology; Queer Abstraction” – Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art *Stedelijk Museum-Hertogenbosch *\\"Rites of Spring\\" (group show) - Contemporary Arts Museum Houston – (01/11/2014 – September 3, 2014) *\\"A Constellation\\" (group show) - The Studio Museum in Harlem – (11/12/2015 – June 3, 2016) *\\"Trigger: Gender as a Tool and a Weapon\\" (group show) – The New Museum – (09/27/17 – 01/21/18) *2019 Whitney Biennial – Whitney Museum of American Art – curated by Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta ==References== ==External links== *Troy Michie is making collage art a little more queer – Vice – André-Naquian Wheeler Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:University of Texas at El Paso alumni Category:Yale School of Art alumni Category:LGBT people from Texas Category:LGBT people from New York (state) Category:LGBT African Americans Category:LGBT artists from the United States Category:African-American artists Category:African-American painters Category:African-American contemporary artists Category:American contemporary artists Category:Afro-Latinx visual artists ","title":"Troy Michie"},{"id":"60279845","text":"Delta () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Buzansky Selsoviet, Krasnoyarsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

He became a moderator and was a prisoner on the Bass Rock. Law was born in 1632, the son of Thomas Law, minister of Inchinnan. Like John Spreul he began life as an apothecary. He graduated with an M.A. from the University of Glasgow in 1653. He was ordained to be the minister of Campsie in 1656. He was deprived of this charge in 1662 but later restored in 1678. He was again deprived on account of the Test in 1681. He was called to the High Church 22 July 1689. He was appointed to the charge 20 April 1692 and confirmed by the town council 24 July 1689. He was a member of the General Assemblies in 1690 and 1692 and was elected Moderator in 1694. He was appointed almoner to His Majesty on 2 October 1700 (P. S. Reg. Eng., v., 390). He demitted his charge or retired on 26 November 1707 and died 26 December 1712. He was interred on the Bass Rock from April 1679 until July 1679. His brother was the minister of East Kilpatrick. ==Early ministry== John Law, born around 1632, graduated with a Master of Arts degree from Glasgow University allowing him to be known as Mr. John Law. He was ordained by the Protesters to be minister of Campsie in 1656. He was deprived by an Act of Parliament on 11 June, and Decreet of Privy Council 1 October 1662. Law for the next eight years conducted conventicles — often at great risk to himself — in the west of Stirlingshire, about Kippen, Gargunnock, and Menteith. Under the \\"Indulgence Act\\" he was allowed to exercise the functions of the ministry in the parish of Irvine in 1672, but declined, and as he did not appear before the council when called, 12 March 1673, they ordered his apprehension, 4 June 1674. However, he did not conﬁne himself to these parts; and, accordingly, a warrant was issued for his apprehension. He was accused at the Diocesan Synod, 22 October, of holding conventicles at Kippen. Captured and taken to the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, Law was brought before \\"My Lords\\" but discharged upon a security of ﬁve thousand merks to \\"live orderly \\"; or, in default thereof, to be treated as a \\"seditious\\" person. This was in 1674. But he was no sooner set at liberty than he entered again into all the enthusiasm of conventicles and managed, for ﬁve years, to elude the state's control. He was put to the horn on 7 December 1676. A meeting-house built for him in the parish in 1678 was demolished by order of the council. About the beginning of 1679 he was arrested, in the house of the laird of Kincaid, while on his way to visit his dying wife. (Mrs. Law seems to have recovered from her dangerous illness at that time, as the date of her death, marked on the tombstone in Old Greyfriars, was 8 November 1703.) He was sent prisoner to the Bass Rock in 1679, for \\"invading several pulpits and presuming to ordain persons to the ministry\\" but was released after three months on finding caution to appear when called and under a bond of one thousand merks. He was deprived in 1681, probably on account of the Test was restored by Act of Parliament 25 April 1690, but having been called to the High Kirk, Edinburgh, accepted that charge. ==After the Revolutionary Settlement== After the Revolution he became minister of the St. Giles', Edinburgh. Law died in December 1712, at the advanced age of eighty years, and was buried in the churchyard of Old Greyfriars. His Wife, Isabella Cunninghame, \\"noted for true holiness,\\" was interred in the same place, on 8 November 1703, in her 70th year. ==Family life== He married Isabella (died 8 November 1703, aged 70), who was the daughter of Robert Cunningham, minister of Holywood, Ireland, and had issue — William, professor of moral philosophy in the University of Edinburgh, founder of the family of Law of Elvingston, East Lothian.

She was the mother of American actor, director, producer, and writer Emory Johnson. In 1912 he dropped out of college and embarked upon his new career in the movie business. Emory started working for Essanay Studios as an assistant camera operator. In 1913, Emilie and her husband moved from San Francisco, California to Essanay company bungalows in Niles, California to support her son. In 1915, she started writing stories for the screen. In the 1920s, Emilie Johnson and her son became famous as the only mother-son directing/writing team in Hollywood. She wrote all of the stories and screenplays her son used for his successful career in directing melodramas. The Johnson team continued producing melodramas until the late twenties. By the early thirties, their string of successes had ended. Emilie died in Los Angeles, California in 1941. She was living with her son at the time of her death. ==Early life== Emilie Johnson was born Emilie Matilda Jönsdotter in Gothenburg, Västra Götaland, Sweden on June 3, 1867. When she was eight years old, her school in Karlskrona was visited by a Church of Sweden Lutheran minister. As part of his tour, he read three stanzas of poetry written by young Emilie Jönsdotter. Impressed, he asked her parents if they would consider letting him adopt Emilie. If they consented, the minister would then assume the responsibility for her upbringing and education. The minister was an up-and-coming member of the Lutheran Church and a prominent writer in Sweden. Emilie's parents, realizing the minister could provide educational opportunities they could never afford, agreed to the arrangement. The minister became a bishop and eventually became an adviser to the King of Sweden. Emilie's education continued until the bishop died. After the bishop's passing, she migrated to America. She arrived in San Francisco, California on September 24, 1891. She was 25 years old and unmarried. While living in San Francisco, she met Alfred Johnson. Alf and Emilie fell in love and married at the Ebenezer Lutheran Church in San Francisco, California on May 11, 1893. Their only child, Alfred Emory Johnson, was born on March 16, 1894, in San Francisco. In 1900, the Johnson family was living comfortably on Bush Street in San Francisco, California. Emilie's husband owned a famous Turkish bathing house. The family lived in a fine house and had live-in servants. Provided in association with National Archives and Records Administration In 1906, the catastrophic San Francisco earthquake changed everything. The quake caused numerous fires throughout the city. One fire destroyed Johnson's bathhouse. The Johnsons survived the quake and resettled in nearby Alameda, California. By 1910, Emilie's husband supported the family by helping to establish the famous Piedmont baths. Provided in association with National Archives and Records Administration Emilie continued to raise their son, and attended California College of the Arts as an art major. In 1912, Emilie's teenage son Emory Johnson entered the movie business as an assistant cameraman. Later, he signed a movie contract with Essanay Studios. In 1913, to more closely support their son's blossoming movie career, Emilie and her husband moved to one of the newly built Essanay bungalows in Niles, California. ==First chapter== In 1914, the Liberty Motion Picture Company was founded in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Five months later, the company reorganized into the Liberty Film Mfg Company with offices located in San Mateo, and Glendale, California. This year, Emilie Johnson started writing scenarios for the silver screen. Later she would meet and befriend a leading actress of Liberty Film Mfg. Co - Swedish actress Sadie Lindblom. Together, they believed they were looking at an opportunity in the movie business. In addition to writing stories for the screen, they could exercise even more control by producing their films. In keeping with their new strategy on writing and producing films, the Liberty Film Company was incorporated in Oakland, California. The papers were drawn up, and the following individuals declared a capital stock investment of $25,000 (over $600,000 in today's money): Emilie Johnson (age 51), Alfred Johnson (age 54), Emory Johnson (age 21), Tillie Hall and Sadie Lindblom (age 25). Lindblom would be the new president. Liberty Film Company began releasing films early in 1915 using the Kriterion Film Corporation as their releasing agent. By June 1915, Kriterion was having cash flow problems, then went bankrupt and left Liberty Film with a $40,000 debt. After choosing a new releasing agent - Associated Service, Liberty Film Mfg Co struggled on. The Liberty Film Company completed several movies. In late 1914, many actors and actresses started to leave Essanay Studios. Many switched to Liberty Film. Several factors precipitated the talent exit, including Essanay's continuing refusal to make more feature- length movies, and the fact that Essanay was losing money. Included in the exit was Emilie's son. Emory Johnson's last film for Essanay was released in June 1914. On February 16, 1916, the Niles Essanay studio closed and locked its doors. Liberty Films struggled with their new distributor. In December 1915, the courts appointed a new receiver. Liberty's Pennsylvania plant burned to the ground in 1916. At the beginning of 1916, Emory left Liberty and signed a contract with Universal Film Manufacturing Company. He made 19 movies in 1916. 1917 marked another noteworthy event for the Johnsons. In September, Emory Johnson, still under contract to Universal, married Universal ingenue Ella Hall. After their honeymoon, they both returned to work at Universal. Newlywed Ella then moves into the Franklin Avenue house along with Emory, Emile, and two servants. Grandson Walter Emory was born in January 1919. Alfred Bernard followed in September 1920. Provided in association with National Archives and Records Administration ==Hollywood decade== ===1921=== This would be a watershed year for 54-year-old Emilie Johnson. Previously, she had written the story \\"Blind Hearts\\". The story takes place in 1898. The tale unfolds as two men are traveling with their wives to Alaska seeking fame and fortune. Hobart Bosworth Productions purchased the story. The film version was released in October 1921 and starred Hobart Bosworth and Wade Boteler.Progressive Silent Film List: Blind Hearts at silentera.com That same year, Hobart Bosworth Productions picked up another Emilie Johnson vehicle - The Sea Lion. This was a tale of adventure, romance, and intrigue aboard a whaling vessel sailing in the high seas. The movie version was released in December 1921. The Sea Lion starred Hobart Bosworth, Bessie Love and Emory Johnson. ===1922=== Emilie and her son had originally contracted with Robertson-Cole to write, produce and direct The Midnight Call. Then R-C was acquired by FBO. On July 1, 1922, the Robertson-Cole Distribution company became known as FBO. All R-C contracts were honored, especially with independent producers like Emory Johnson. In May, the Riverside Independent Enterprise published an article stating Emilie had written 19 scenarios. The first Johnson collaboration under the renamed FBO contract was The Midnight Call, which was renamed In the Name of the Law. The film was released in August 1922. Emilie Johnson was credited with both the story and screenplay for this melodrama. The story is about a San Francisco policeman trying to keep his family together while facing continuing adversity.In the Name of the Law the AFI Catalog of Feature Films In December, FBO released The Third Alarm, formerly titled The Discard. This film is the second under the FBO contract. Emory directed this Emilie Johnson story about a fireman forced into retirement who later makes a triumphant return to save the day. It had spectacular scenes of burning buildings and courage-fueled firemen. The film would become the most financially successful movie ever produced in Johnson's career.The Third Alarm The AFI Catalog of Feature Films Emilie had four of her stories shown simultaneously: * Blind Hearts, released October 3, 1921 * The Sea Lion, released December 5, 1921 * In the Name of the Law (aka The Midnight Call), released August 22, 1922 * The Third Alarm, released December 31, 1922 ===1923=== The third film in the FBO contract was The West~Bound Limited. Emilie wrote both the story and screenplay. The story is about railroad engineer Bill Buckley who narrowly avoids injuring the daughter of the president of the company by stopping his speeding train just in the nick of time. Various misfortunes ensue, Bill's son saves the daughter, and everybody lives happily ever after. The fourth film in the FBO contract was The Mailman. Emilie wrote both the story and the screenplay. The film provides an excellent example of melodrama and displays Emilie's flair for this genre. This story unfolds as veteran postman Bob Morley (played by Ralph Lewis) and his son Johnnie (played by Johnnie Walker) are both honored for their years of service. Johnnie receives a promotion to work on a postal service ship, the Enterprise, which carries registered postal mail. A robbery occurs one night on the ship. The robbers kill a postal officer, which Johnnie witnesses. The perpetrators throw him, the only witness, overboard into the sea. Johnnie is recovered by a yacht that happens to be in the area. In a twist of fate, the vessel is a rum-runner and happens to be involved in the robbery of the Enterprise. Johnnie alerts the Pacific fleet. The entire fleet pursues the rum-running yacht with ten dreadnoughts. The warships destroy the 90-foot yacht. Johnnie is saved from the destruction, only to face trial for killing a government postal officer during the robbery. His father desperately contacts everyone he knows, pleading to save his son. As the court is about to sentenced Johnnie to hang for the shooting, the real perpetrator confesses, and all ends well.TheMailman The AFI Catalog of Feature Films In September, Emilie and Emory signed a new contract with FBO. The contract was for 2½ years. Emory Johnson agreed to make eight attractions for FBO, including the four he had completed already. FBO agreed to invest upwards of two and one- half million dollars () in the forthcoming productions. Another part of the signed contract stipulated: \\"The contract also provides that Emory Johnson's mother, Mrs. Emilie Johnson, shall prepare all of the stories and write all the scripts for the Johnson attractions in addition to assisting her son in filming the productions.\\" ===1924=== Emilie started the year by writing the story for the fifth FBO film, Life's Greatest Game, released in May. This story is about America's greatest pastime, baseball. The Black Sox Scandal provided inspiration for the section of the movie regarding the throwing of a World Series. The rest of the film features crooks, illicit affairs, the spectacular sinking of the Titanic, romance, and a middle-aged father uniting with his long-lost son. Emilie finished the year with the sixth film in this series, The Spirit of the USA, released in December. She wrote both the story and the screenplay. She claimed Woodrow Wilson inspired this story about World War I. The movie has scenes of European battlefields, a spectacular scene of a dam blowing up, a mother's love for her sons, betrayal, and skullduggery. Both sons end up going to Europe, but only one returns. Everyone thought he had died in battle. After his return, he restores order to those who were hoodwinked and lost their property. He marries his sweetheart, and they live happily ever after. ===1925=== The seventh film in the FBO contract was The Last Edition, released in October. Emilie wrote the story for their only production of the year. This was the \\"last hurrah\\" for the working man series of movies. The story starts when Tom McDonald, assistant foreman of the San Francisco Chronicle pressroom, is passed over for the job of press foreman. He takes solace that his son Ray has a good job in the district attorney's office. Reporter Clarence loves Tom's daughter Polly. Clarence is currently working on a story about a gang of bootleggers. To put Clarence off their track, the bad guys' frame Ray on a bribery charge. Clarence reports the trumped-up charge to the Chronicle in time to make the last edition. Just as the story is about to hit the presses, Dan finds out. He attempts to shut down the machinery so they will be unable to print the story. He fails and is thrown into jail with his son. Meanwhile, the plant is burned down, and Dan receives the blame. Clarence and Polly eventually uncover evidence exonerating father and son. Tom becomes the new foreman, they build a new plant, and Clarence marries Polly. ===1926=== The year started with tragedy. Emilie's grandson was run over by a truck and killed in Los Angeles. Alfred Bernard Johnson was only five years old when he died in March 1926. He was Emilie's second oldest grandson. In March, Emory and Emilie Johnson released their last picture for FBO, The Non-Stop Flight. The story starts out in 1906 Sweden. A sea captain, Lars Larson, returns home from a long voyage. He discovers his wife and child kidnapped. He goes mad and becomes a smuggler. Fast-forward to 1925, when the Navy is conducting its history-making nonstop flight from San Francisco to Hawaii. A fuel shortage forces the plane down in the Pacific. The PN9 drifts to an uncharted island. Once the crews travel to the island, they find a hermit and a beautiful woman. The crew's second in command falls in love. Captain Lars happens to be on the island at the same time. A conflict breaks out between smugglers, flyboys and Chinese coolies. A US submarine arrives in the nick of time to rescue the downed plane and restores order. Captain Lars finds out the woman is his missing daughter and the plane's number two gets the girl. This same year, Emory and Emilie were working on a movie titled Happiness. Work had supposedly started in December 1925. Emory, Emilie, and cast and crew had sailed for Sweden to film the movie. The fate of the movie remains unknown. In April, FBO decided to let Emory and Emilie Johnson's contracts expire. No reason was published regarding the expirations. In June, Emory and his mother signed a new eight-picture deal with Universal. ===1927=== Emilie was now approaching 60 years old, while Emory was still in his thirties. In March, Universal released the Fourth Commandment. Emilie wrote the story. This tale starts by showing a devoted son living with his mother and his wife. His wife becomes jealous of her mother-in-law's devotion to her son. She orders his mother to leave home. They eventually get divorced, and she marries a millionaire. They have a son. Her husband goes broke, and she loses everything. The disgraced divorced wife is forced to move in with her son and his wife. The circle is now complete; she starts to experience the same hardships her first mother-in-law had endured. In September, Emilie \\"assisted\\" in the writing of The Lone Eagle, according to the credits. This Emory Johnson movie is a World War I aviation film. Billy is an American aviator who gets an assignment to the Royal Fling Corps. The unit is located on the western front and sees plenty of action. During one encounter with the enemy, Billy is accused of cowardice. Then he meets Mimi, a French girl. She inspires him to prove his bravery in battle. During the next air skirmish, Billy's best friend shoots down a German ace, but is killed in the process. The German aviator's brother, upset over his sibling's death, challenges the Allies to a sky duel. After loads of action, Billy shoots the German ace down. After the Armistice is signed, Billy marries Mimi, they return to the United States. ===1928=== In February, Universal released The Shield of Honor. Emilie wrote the story. This film starts out when veteran policeman Dan MacDowell and his son Jack are honored at an event celebrating the addition of an airplane to the police force. Jack will become the plane's first pilot. Gwen, the daughter of a wealthy jeweler, christens a plane. Jack and Gwen immediately fall in love. Her father asks Jack to help him solve the jewel robberies of his customers. Jack investigates and narrows the search to Gwen's father's business partner. Another robbery is committed, and Jack knows who did it. Jack and his father jump into the police plane, pursue the criminals and fight a night air battle. The jewel thieves are captured. Jack and Gwen live happily ever after. After completing three fairly successful movies for Universal, the Johnson team jumped ship, reneged on their eight-picture contract and signed with another company. Emory and his mother negotiated a new contract with Poverty Row studio Tiffany-Stahl Productions. Major chunks of 1929 were spent with Emory trying to reunite with Ella Hall and repair their marriage. Because they had lost Alfred Bernard in 1926, Emory and Ella decided to have one last child. Emilie's granddaughter Diana Marie (Dinie) was born in October 1929. Provided by State of California Department of Health Services, Center for Health Statistics. ===1930–1932=== In November 1930, Emory Johnson released his first Tiffany-Stahl Productions contract production, The Third Alarm. This film would become his first talkie. Although the name of this film was the same as the 1922 version, the similarity ended there. This remake is a family drama about a young heroine and her younger brother who are orphaned when their father is killed in a fire. A hero emerges who tries the children from going to an orphan asylum. A fire starts at the orphanage and the children must be saved. After saving them, the hero realizes he is in love with one of the orphans. They get married and live together with her brother. Emilie's original story is the basis for this film, but the similarity only extends to both stories being about firefighters. The screenwriting duties of this version of The third Alarm were assigned to another T-S writer, Frances Hyland. A significant news item appeared on Page 4 of the September 4, 1930 edition of Variety Magazine. > Emory Johnson, engaged by Tiffany to direct \\"The Third Alarm\\" on the > strength of his silent of the same title for FBO; has been off the picture > since the first day's shooting. Martin Cohn, the editorial supervisor at > Tiff, is finishing it, although direction credit will go to Johnson, beside > a piece of the picture. Johnson objected to the supervision. The Third Alarm was the last film Emory Johnson made for Tiffany. Emory Johnson signed a new contract with another Poverty Row studio – Majestic Pictures. In August 1932, Emory Johnson released his last film, Majestic Pictures' The Phantom Express. Emilie received a story credit. Emory Johnson tried to recreate the success of his previous railroad film, The West~Bound Limited. The first railroad film was a silent, but this was a talkie. This story starts with engineer Smoky Nolan speeding down the tracks at full throttle when he spies an oncoming train directly in his path. He quickly applies the emergency brakes and the train starts screeching to a halt, but then derails. Several passengers are killed. Nobody can find any trace of the oncoming train causing the derailment, and Smoky is fired. Smoky has a beautiful daughter, Carolyn, and the CEO of the Southwest Pacific Railroad has a playboy son - Bruce. Boy meets girl, and they both set out to find the mystery of the phantom express. During their investigation, they uncover a diabolical scheme concocted by a network of bad guys. Because of the accidents, the bad guys want to purchase the railroad at a reduced cost. Bruce discovers the plot just hours before his father is going to sign the railroad over to the bad guys. The telegraph is down because of a storm, and the only way to advise his father is to have old 101 engineered by Smoky Nolan transport Bruce back to the central office so he can personally warn his father not to sell. The train must travel through floods, landslide, and other hazards. They make it just in time to nix the deal. Bruce and Carolyn hook up and honeymoon on the train. This was the curtain call for Emory's independent directing years, along with Emile's collaborative writing. Emory was contracted to make one last picture for Majestic, Air Patrol, but the project never came to fruition. ==Final chapter== In 1930, Emile Johnson turned 63 years old. Two years later, Emory Johnson filed for bankruptcy. Emilie and Emory sold the house on Franklin Avenue where Emory, his mother, Ella Hall, and all the kids had lived. Emory and his mother moved to a new house on Killion street sometime after 1930. Provided in association with National Archives and Records Administration Emory became a portrait photographer in Los Angeles and eventually relocated to San Mateo, California. He died in 1961. After 1932, Emilie's movie writing career was over. This last decade of her life was unremarkable. It closed with her death on September 23, 1941, at the age of 74 in Los Angeles, California. ==Family== Emilie Johnson was married to her only husband Alfred and had one son, Emory Johnson. Emilie had four grandchildren after her son married Ella Hall: # Walter Emory Jr, born in 1919, changed his name to Richard Emory and had an acting career in B Movies # Alfred Bernard, born in 1920, died in 1925 # Ellen Joanna, born in 1923, changed her name to Ellen Hall and had an acting career in B movies # Diana Marie, born in 1929, became a housewife ==Themes== Emilie Johnson wrote stories about law enforcement officers, firefighters, mail carriers, railroad engineers, patriots, baseball players, and newspaper pressmen. Her son brought them to the screen in epic melodramas. Nobody else had written screenplays about the everyday working joes. The Johnson team felt their human-interest stories would be relatable on the silver screen. Emory had also earned the title of \\"King of Exploitation.\\" The moniker was good for advertising but not truly earned. As the quote box shows, \\"His pictures will be made for exploitation.\\" The exploitation angle was not the brainchild of the Johnsons. FBO's Nat Rothstein hatched the exploitation strategy for all the Johnson movies. An example of this strategy can be seen at In the Name of the Law - Exploitation. ==Quotes== For the author, the world is your oyster.< I would much rather write for the screen than for the stage or the publisher. The greatest appeal in pictures is not in extravagant spectacles, historical pageants or adaptation of fairy tales. I think the straight-forward, clean, wholesome melodrama will always have the choice corner in the hearts of the American public.\\" Throughout my work, I have followed one rule which I think is successful. It is the combining of emotion with humor - making a laugh follow a scene of pathos. Emilie discussed \\"The Third Alarm\\" with the newspaper - \\"When creating a third alarm, I took every possible opportunity to visit the engine houses of the fire department, watching the actions of the firemen and observing the procedure in answering an alarm. Emory is always with me on these occasions, and we are in consultation daily in regard to angles of the story that present themselves as a result of our observations. Together we attend the fire chief's convention at San Francisco.\\" ==Selected film credits == { class=\\" mw-collapsible\\" style=\\"text-align:left\\" - !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Year !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Film !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Producer !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Distributor !style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Credits * !style=\\"width: 90px; text-align: left;\\"  Notes - 1921 Blind Hearts Hobart Bosworth Associated Producers Story  - 1921 The Sea Lion Hobart Bosworth Associated Producers Story  - 1922 In the Name of the Law Emory Johnson FBO Story, screenplay  - 1922 The Third Alarm Emory Johnson FBO Story  - 1923 The West~Bound Limited Emory Johnson FBO Story, screenplay  - 1923 The Mailman Emory Johnson FBO Story, screenplay  - 1924 The Spirit of the USA Emory Johnson FBO Story, screenplay  - 1924 Life's Greatest Game Emory Johnson FBO Story  - 1926 The Last Edition Emory Johnson FBO Story, screenplay  - 1926 The Non-Stop Flight Emory Johnson FBO Story, screenplay  - 1927 The Lone Eagle Universal Pictures Universal Pictures Adaptation  - 1927 The Shield of Honor Universal Pictures Universal Pictures Story  - 1927 Fourth Commandment Universal Pictures Universal Pictures Story Fourth Commandment at the AFI Catalog of Feature Films - 1930 The Third Alarm Tiffany Productions Tiffany Productions Story The Third Alarm details @ IMDb.com] - } * Based on WGA screenwriting credit system ==References* * American Film Institute Catalog listing on Emilie Johnson * Essay on the movie The Last Edition, including insights on Emilie Johnson * Catalogue of Copyright Entries -Motion Pictures 1912 to 1939 Category:1867 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Screenwriters from California Category:People from Greater Los Angeles Category:Writers Guild of America Category:American film producers Category:20th-century American screenwriters ","title":"Emilie Johnson"},{"id":"60280023","text":"Brian D.

Particularly given the drug-use scandal hanging over Keith Richards at the time, the period was frenetic. In a 2014 interview, Sage described long days in the studio and a prolific output of 40 tracks and 80 reels. During the production of Tattoo You, Mick Jagger and Sage were working alone one night when Jagger asked Sage to record himself clapping for a song.

Simurrum was an important city state of the Mesopotamian area, during the period of the Akkadian Empire down to Ur III. The Simurrum Kingdom disappears from records after the Old Babylonian period. According to an inscription (the stela now located in the Sulaymaniyah Museum), Iddin-Sin seems to have been contemporary with Lullubi king Annubanini.History of Iddin-Sin's stela Several rulers of the Simurrum Kingdom are known, such as Iddin-Sin and his son Zabazuna. Various inscriptions suggest that they were contemporary with king Ishbi-Erra (1953—c.1920 BCE). In inscriptions, the name of Iddin-Sin is written 𒀭𒄿𒋾𒀭𒂗𒍪, with one silent honorific (𒀭, \\"Divine\\") before the phonological part of the name, 𒄿𒋾𒀭𒂗𒍪, where the second 𒀭 (An) has the value of \\"n\\". The last part 𒂗𒍪 was initially En-Zu but is pronounced Sîn, name of the Moon God. Four inscription and a relief of the Simurrum have been identified at Bitwata near Ranya in Iraqi Kurdistan, near the border with Iran, including the large relief now in the Israel Museum, and one from Sarpol-e Zahab. It is thought that the design of the relief is derived from the Victory Stele of Naram-Sin, King of the Akkadian Empire (2254-2218 BCE), in which the king is also seen trampling enemies. It is also similar to other reliefs in the area, such as the Anubanini rock relief. The Sarpol-e Zahab relief, representing a beardless warrior with axe, trampling a foe, and inscribed with the name \\"Zaba(zuna), son of ...\\", may be the son of Iddin-Sin. Iddi-Sin is also known from a stele, which he inscribed in the Akkadian language, now in the Sulaymaniyah Museum, Iraq. A seal showing Iddin-Sin and his son Zabazuna (: Za-ba-zu-na), is also known from the Rosen collection.

His father was a mechanic during World War I, but after the war, was unable to find a job in his field. Minter's father instead worked for thirty years as caretaker of a white cemetery. Joe Minter attended local Birmingham schools, was drafted in 1965 and discharged in 1967. After the military, Minter took a series of low-paying jobs, from dishwasher at a drive-in, to messenger and orderly hospital work. Minter also worked in metals, constructed school furniture, did work on cars, and with crews building roads. As a result of his fabrication work, Minter got asbestos dust in his eyes in the 1960s and ‘70s. Minter had one eye was operated upon to mediate the asbestos; however, he wouldn't let the doctors operate the other eye. Minter never lost the feeling of grit in his eyes and was forced to retire. Upon retiring, Minter rediscovered an artistic practice dormant since childhood. ==Artistic practice== ===African Village in America=== Located on the southwest edge of Birmingham, Alabama and begun in the late 1980s and built over the course of thirty years, Minter's African Village in America is part sculpture garden, part history museum, and part memorial. The African Village in America is an ever-evolving art environment, populated by sculptures made from scrap and found materials from footwear, lawn decorations, toys, old sporting equipment, to baking utensils, and more. Although Minter's sculpture have a variety of themes and influences, from one commemorating the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting to one dedicated to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, Minter's overriding message is to provide a recognition for the eleven million Africans shipped in bondage to America, and to their descendants who helped to build and defend America. The sculptures in the African Village in America tell the stories of African-Americans over the centuries, from the griots and warriors of West Africa to the deadly 1963 bombing at the 16th Street Baptist Church. ===Exhibitions=== *2019 – Whitney Biennial – Whitney Museum of American Art – curated by Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta *2018 – History Refused to Die: Highlights from the Souls Grown Deep Foundation Gift - Metropolitan Museum of Art *2018 - Revelations: Art from the African American South - de Young Museum, San Francisco, CA *2018 - Joe Minter: Once That River Starts to Flow - Atlanta Contemporary, Atlanta, Georgia *2017 - The Road Less Traveled Exhibition Series.

The Pundersons fled to Long Island, where they lived in reduced circumstances for the duration of the war. ==Work and illness== Prudence turned to domestic work to earn money. In 1780 she overcame a severe illness that threatened her artistic ability; a letter to her sister from this time survives, speaking of a \\"gathering\\" on her breast that required lancing. ==Marriage and death== On October 20, 1783, she married Timothy Wells Rossiter; their daughter Sophia was born on July 18, 1784, and Prudence died on September 16 of the same year. She was interred in the Maple Cemetery in Berlin, Connecticut. ==Art== Rossiter produced a number of needlework pictures, including twelve depictions of the twelve apostles inspired by print sources. She is best known, however, for the self-portrait The First, Second, and Last Scene of Morality, completed around 1775. This work portrays a young woman, the artist herself, seated at a table in a finely-furnished parlor. To one side is a baby in a cradle, being cared for by a black servant. To the other is a coffin, marked \\"PP\\", sitting on a table. The piece is owned by the Connecticut Historical Society. The same organization owns her other needlework pieces as well as her letters, poetry, drawings, and diary. They provide a rare glimpse into the life of a young woman of the period. Rossiter's embroidery is the most-reproduced piece in the Society's collection. Elements of Rossiter's art have been incorporated into the work of artist Kiki Smith.

She is best known for crossover projects, sculpture and drawing. ==Early life and education== Pullen was born to Gillian Lovitt (née Wickwire) and Hugh Francis Haswell Pullen in Montreal, Quebec and raised in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 1994 she received a bachelor's degree in studio art from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax. In 2001 she received a Master of Fine Art from Tyler School of Art, Temple University, in Philadelphia. From 2002 to 2013 Pullen was an assistant professor of visual art at the University of Victoria in British Columbia Canada, tenured in 2007. ==Work== In 2018, Pullen participated in the CAFKA (Contemporary Art Forum Kitchener and Area), a biannual, free public exhibition of contemporary art in the cities and surrounding areas of Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge. For CAFKA.18, Pullen produced a mural, titled Recognize Everyone, that covers the elevator shaft and the wraparound fire escape on the building of 27 Gaukel Street in Kitchener. The polychromatic star mural work is an immersive art work, that visitors can walk into as they climb the stairs of the building. In her series Interval for Halifax (2013), Pullen wrapped playground swings in Scotchlite tape. Visitors interact with the work by playing on the swings. The artist suggests photographing the swings in action, using flash, in order to experience the work fully. \\"The swing is [wrapped] in reflective material, in a certain moment it looks like a line of light, as if someone is riding a bolt of lightning.\\" The use of silver reappears throughout Pullen's work. Examples include, a silver print of the artist in a reflective silver skirt Flash, 1999; a series of drawings made on metallic paper Portal, 2002; and a rope sculpture covered in the same light-sensitive Scotchlite material called The Thing, 2003; and Ladder and Ladders, both 2003, which also involve the eponymous being covered in Scotchlite material. Pullen's work has been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Henry Art Gallery (Seattle, 2011), Artspeak (Vancouver, 2010), The Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver, 2003), Art Metropole (Toronto, 2006) and Eye Level Gallery (Halifax, 1997).

It can be critically linked to conceptualism, and to a NSCAD trend to use unusual materials to make metaphysical points, but it is not necessary to know a secret art language to understand or enjoy it.Bernard, A., \\"Great Pairs of Legs Sculptor’s style playful; painter as darker view\\" The Chronicle-Herald, Halifax: May 9, 1997 Her work is marked by conceptual ambition, technical daring, and antic humor.Hayes, K., 1:1 Recent Halifax Sculpture, SL Simpson Gallery, Toronto Canada: April 4–30, 1996 Pullen's work is built on paradox.Jenkner, I., Somewhere Along The Line, Mount St. Vincent Art Gallery, Halifax: 2009 While her work varies dramatically in its final form, an analytical orientation can be isolated as a unifying thread throughout her recent work.Laurin, G., St. Mary’s University Art Gallery, Halifax, Canada: April 9 – May 18, 1997 Product and invention never seem to be the point.

He authors books as well as offers advice online on such forums as Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop column and his own website. William claims that the Epstein-Barr virus is responsible for multiple ailments, including cancer. He is the self-proclaimed originator of the lemon juice in water morning detox as well as the celery juice fad, which he claims can offer many health benefits that are not scientifically proven. Critics allege that he is practising medicine without a license and that he has, at times, improperly solicited positive Amazon reviews for his books. ==Early life== Anthony William Coviello claims that he first received his expertise through a connection to \\"Spirit\\" when he was four years old. He claims that he correctly diagnosed his grandmother with lung cancer, and often \\"healed\\" family and friends throughout his childhood. ==Career== William is best known as the \\"Medical Medium\\". He is a New York Times bestselling author who has published 6 books. Anthony William's company is based in Sarasota, Florida. He is a writer for Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, for which he is considered a \\"trusted expert\\". He had over 1.6 million followers on Instagram as of 2019 and had 3.3 million followers on Facebook as of 2019. His website also contains at least 177 revenue-generating affiliate links to Amazon products, such as nutritional supplements. According to the legal disclaimers on his site as well as on his Goop articles, William has no certifications of scientific or medical training. His disclaimers also advise that his suggestions should not be a substitute for medical advice, and that you should seek advice from a medical doctor before following his advice. He has frequently been solicited by the traditional press for comments, but appears to infrequently engage with journalists. ==Claims and practice== ===Psychic connection and angels=== William asserts that his abilities come from a psychic connection with Spirit, which allows him to diagnose other people of various illnesses as well as offering treatment. William claims that Spirit gives him the ability to scan bodies in a way that can diagnose all blockages, infections, trouble areas, past problems, and even soul fractures with knowledge that comes from Spirit. He believes this information will eventually be recognized by the scientific community. The final chapter of his book, Life-Changing Foods, is called Life-Changing Angels. In this chapter he explains that he believes in the existence of twelve different angels, with names such as the Angel of Abundance and the Angel of Addiction. He encourages his followers to invoke the names of specific angels to ask for help in various circumstances. ===Cancer and Epstein-Barr virus=== Epstein-Barr virus One of the health issues that William most frequently diagnoses is chronic disease that is created by the Epstein–Barr virus, for which he prescribes a treatment of B12 vitamins that Spirit recommends, along with high doses of celery juice. He asserts that the virus can be transmitted in utero. Current scientific evidence suggests that it is most often transmitted via saliva. William says, in his Goop column, that \\"ninety-eight percent of the time, cancer is caused by a virus and at least one type of toxin\\". He attributes many cancers to the Epstein-Barr virus, and that this virus is \\"responsible for breast cancer, liver cancer, almost all lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, prostate cancer, women's reproductive cancers, leukemia, and many more.” William feels strongly that the cancers we face today are something that has advanced rapidly recently, specifically since the Industrial Revolution. He also contends that cancer as a whole has no genetic component, despite scientific evidence to the contrary. William also suggests that the Epstein-Barr virus causes over 95% of thyroid issues, which needs more research as there is no current scientific evidence supporting this view. According to the CDC, there is no current peer-reviewed scientific evidence to support the claim that the Epstein-Barr virus causes lung cancer. The American Cancer Society has noted that the Epstein-Barr virus might possibly be linked to Hodgkin's lymphoma or certain stomach cancers, but this is still undetermined. ===Food and diet=== In his book, Life Changing Foods, he considers \\"fruits, vegetables, herbs and spices, and wild foods\\" to be the Holy Four. Of them he claims: Against these Holy Four he positions the Unforgiving Four, which are radiation, toxic heavy metals, the viral explosion, and DDT. Of these, he claims that they \\"ravage our bodies, make us question our own sanity, and push us to the breaking point as a society.\\" William also claims that there are two kinds of Living Water. \\"Hydrobioactive water\\" is found in all of the Holy Four foods. This, he states, can hydrate a person more than tap water. He also claims there is a, yet undiscovered, cofactor in water which \\"contains information to help restore your soul and spirit and to support your emotions.\\" He also describes six foods which he considers to be life-challenging. He contends that dairy bogs down the liver; eggs feed the viral explosion; corn is no longer nutritious due to overuse of genetic modification; wheat feeds pathogens; canola oil destroys the lining of the stomach, veins, and heart, and finally that food additives described or labeled as \\"natural flavors\\" are actually a neurotoxin called MSG which, he feels, destroy brain and nerve cells over time. ===Celery juice=== Celery juice Anthony William is the self proclaimed originator of the celery juice diet, and journalistic research has led others to conclude that he is the primary source. William claims that \\"the science behind the healing powers of celery juice is just yet to be discovered\\" because it is from the future. Currently none of his claims can be proven. William claims that celery juice has medicinal uses. He suggests that it can \\"improve energy levels\\", reduce bloating, increase \\"clarity of mind\\", and even improve such conditions as headaches and anxiety. The juice is supposed to be extra hydrating, \\"inflammation-reducing and microbiome-sustaining\\". He also calls it \\"a miracle juice\\" and \\"one of the greatest healing tonics of all time.\\" None of these claims is supported by scientific evidence, thus no dietitians or other members of the medical community are supportive of these claims. In an interview with UK's Evening Standard William describes how to make celery juice. He claims it has \\"healing powers\\" and explains that it is difficult to make. William explains that the juice must be pure, so not even a squeeze of lemon juice or a mixture of other vegetables is permitted. The juice should be consumed on an empty stomach, first thing in the morning. He recommends doing exactly 16 ounces of juice to start, and working up to 32 ounces, twice a day. He says that it should be ingested at least 15–20 minutes before consuming other food. Amanda Mull, of The Atlantic interviewed two registered dietitians on the benefits of celery juice. They agreed that celery is a healthy snack, and that there is some evidence that celery may have benefits for managing blood pressure, but these benefits were observed when patients ate full stalks. One dietitian remarked, \\"there is no one food that will cure your cancer, inflammatory disease, or other ailment, so don't believe the hype you see and hear on Instagram.\\" Dietitian and Nutritionist, Marika Day, says of William's celery juice claims: Nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert of Harley Street also weighed in to point out that fiber is an important part of diet, and this is lost in the juicing process. She states that there is no current evidence for these more \\"magical claims\\" of celery juice, only anecdotal evidence. Australian dietitian Stefanie Valakas, interviewed by a reporter with news.com.au, also states that there is no evidence for these health claims and that any fiber benefits of celery are lost in the juicing process. Both remark that one is likely to get the same nutritional benefit from drinking a glass of water and eating a balanced diet. Although most medical professionals agree that the potential harm in adding celery juice to one's diet is likely minimal, there is the possibility of a negative reaction with certain medications. Celery contains Vitamin K, which can potentially affect medications, such as Warfarin, if intake suddenly increases. There is also a potential risk of bloating and diarrhea for those suffering from IBS. Ginger Hultin, a dietitian and spokesperson Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, commenting on the celery juice phenomena, warns it is dangerous to attempt to fight diseases, such as cancer with food alone, as many proponents of celery juice claim to do. ===Other=== William also claims that even infertility is treatable with such practices as \\"creative visualizations, walking meditations, and breathing exercises\\", which he claims will \\"draw white light into the reproductive organs.\\" ==Controversy and criticism== ===Goop=== In January 2018, Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop was criticized for posting articles by William, saying that as their \\"trusted expert\\" he \\"dispenses junk science.\\" Goop has said of William, that he: ===Soliciting Amazon reviews=== Jonathan Jarry, of the McGill Office for Science and Society, argues that some of William's accolades are not naturally achieved. For example, he notes that William offered entry into a contest where participants could win autographed books, private consultations, and live show tickets in exchange for positive book reviews on Amazon. Rae Paoletta, of Inverse, found that Anthony William's publisher, Hay House, ran a lottery to give prizes to whoever wrote the \\"most inspiring\\" Amazon review for his 2015 book titled \\"Medical Medium\\". According to Paoletta, \\"when Inverse asked Amazon about the accusations of positive book reviews for compensation, a spokesperson confirmed the e-commerce site would be investigating the claims.\\" ===Practicing medicine without a license=== Jarry also argues that Anthony William is practicing medicine without a license. In William's operating state of Florida, the definition of practicing medicine is as follows: On William's radio shows he allows fans to call in and describe their symptoms. He performs \\"scans\\" with his angel guide, and then offers advice to the caller, suggesting things like eliminating certain food groups, taking vitamin B12, or doing a celery juice cleanse. Jarry argues that this does constitute \\"practicing medicine\\" based on the aforementioned definition. Jarry also describes the case of a woman who, six months after being \\"scanned\\" by Anthony William on a TV program and found to be completely healthy by \\"Spirit\\", was diagnosed with a serious blood disease that William and Spirit were not able to detect. ===Other=== Jennifer Gunter, an OB/GYN from San Francisco who has criticized Goop in the past, made the following statement regarding Anthony William: Harriet Hall argues that \\"William's belief system has no grounding in reality or science.\\" She observes that there is no evidence to back up Anthony William's claimed divine guidance. ==See also== * Mediumship * Goop * Psychic ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Alternative cancer treatment advocates Category:Alternative detoxification promoters Category:American psychics Category:American spiritual mediums Category:Pseudoscientific diet advocates ","title":"Anthony William"},{"id":"60280476","text":"National Highway 373, commonly referred to as NH 373 is a national highway in India.

He was born in Egypt to Greek parents, grew up in Australia, lived and worked in the UK, was imprisoned in South Africa and now lives in France. He is known for his political activism against the apartheid régime in South Africa in the 1970s, and his subsequent incarceration in, and 1979 escape from, Pretoria Local Prison (within the Pretoria Central Prison complex) with Tim Jenkin and Stephen Lee. He returned to France after his escape. ==Biography== ===Early life and activism=== Moumbaris's family migrated to Australia when he was young and he became a naturalised Australian citizen, but he left for France when he was 16 years old. There he met and married a French woman, Marie-José. They moved to London in 1961, where Moumbaris worked for the IT department of Reuters-Comtel. He worked for about nine years before becoming involved with the ANC, as one of the \\"London Recruits\\". He had not grown up in a political family, but when in Britain associated with Communists there and heard and was inspired by the communist resistance to the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. He was also influenced by the Vietnam War and the Greek coup of the colonels in 1967. He started associating with African National Congress (ANC) exiles and from 1967 travelled in and out of South Africa transporting literature for the movement. He also once unfurled an ANC banner from a building in Durban, (As per Oliver Tambo: Beyond the Engeli Mountains (2004) by Luli Callinicos, p.629, this is in the souvenir 25th anniversary issue of the Umkhonto We Sizwe journal Dawn.) and was entrusted with more risky assignments. Moumbaris became involved with the ANC at a time when the organisation had suffered many setbacks. The arrests at Liliesleaf and convictions which followed at the Rivonia Trial in 1963-4 were followed by widespread roundups of activists and leaders, including Bram Fischer and Wilton Mkwayi. Spirits were low and the combination of factors made it difficult for the ANC to re-infiltrate the combatants who had been trained abroad. There was an effort to rebuild the armed wing known as Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), and a plan was hatched by Oliver Tambo, Joe Slovo and/or Moses Mabhida, with the help of the South African Communist Party to land 25 combatants plus arms via a boat previously purchased by the ANC, the Adventurer (or Avventura), on the Transkei coast via the Indian Ocean from Somalia. Moubaris went to the USSR for training. However the boat had developed engine problems and had to return to Somalia. Instead, 25 guerillas were infiltrated overland, with Moumbaris aiding with border reconnaissance and transport, as commander of the receiving operation. Moumbaris and Marie- José were caught while trying to enter South Africa from Botswana in 1972, after a previously arrested comrade had informed on them. The arrest was part of an operation to catch some of the operatives in the operation dubbed \\"the Moumbaris Adventurer Episode\\" by the government. Others were also caught, but they had succeeded in infiltrating a number of trained militants. As Marie- José was pregnant at the time and under pressure from the French ambassador, she was not charged but deported to France after four months. Moumbaris was sentenced in June 1973 to 12 years' imprisonment for conspiring with the ANC to \\"instigate violent revolution in South Africa', aiding guerrillas to enter the country, distributing ANC literature and reconnoitering the coast to find places for the sea-borne landing of guerrillas and arms. On 23 October 1973 the matter of possible theft of documents from the Clapham Common home of Moumbaris and his wife was raised in the UK parliament by Labour MP Alex Lyon. It was suspected that South African agents may have raided the home for documents to use in Moumbaris' trial. Home Office Minister Mark Carlisle said that no evidence had been found at that time of South African responsibility for illegal activities, but that appropriate action would be taken should it appear. ===Prison=== Moumbaris was the only non-South African prisoner, and when Jenkin met him, he appeared as \\"a little aloof\\". He signalled his wish to be included in any possible escape plan to Jenkin even before the idea was presented to him, after Jenkin had mentioned that he and Lee had brought some money into prison. He became instrumental to the escape plan in several ways, making the early suggestion that any escape plan would have to involve the making of keys, providing a hacksaw which he had secreted after plumbers had left it behind, and getting involved in some of the riskier aspects of the planning and testing of the scheme. When an escape committee of three prisoners was set up, Moumbaris (and not Jenkin or Lee) was selected as he was \\"the most vociferous\\" and a good negotiator. His ongoing task of generating enthusiasm amongst the other inmates for the escape plan was onerous, and the stress affected his health. His relationship with the jailers tended towards being outwardly defiant and somewhat aggressive, laughing at new wardens who tried to discipline him. This, along with his generally scruffy appearance and his refusal to keep his cell tidy led to a bad reputation amongst the prison wardens meant that he had never been promoted beyond the \\"B\\" group in his six years in prison, while the others had reached \\"A\\" within two. However, after the escape plan had captured his imagination, he cleaned up and changed his attitude, and was soon promoted to the \\"A\\" group. The wardens were all Afrikaans-speaking and were not fluent in English, and while most of the prisoners were fairly fluent in Afrikaans, they were not familiar with the topics they talked about. Moumbaris, although enrolled in university courses, did not undertake formal studies at all while in prison; it was a cover so that extra books could be obtained from the university library for everyone to make use of; it was a way of keeping themselves informed about the world. Marie-José was repeatedly denied a visitor's visa to visit him in prison, and in February 1978 Moumbaris went on a hunger strike to try to force the authorities to let her in, but after 10 days realised the futility of this and gave up. He was visited in prison twice a year by his mother and young son, Boris, from France. The only languages allowed to be spoken during visits were the two \\"official\\" languages, English and Afrikaans, but as Boris only spoke French and was deemed too young to be a security risk, allowed them to converse in French. Moumbaris was allowed to see the French envoy from time to time, who would assure him that he was doing everything within his power to secure his release and persuade the authorities to let Marie-José visit him. Moumbaris grew cynical about these claims but continued to see him as it was another visit from an outsider, and he could ask him questions about France. He afterwards said that the prison was \\"luxury\\" compared to French prison. He and Jenkin carried out a first trial run of the escape plan, and were involved in a couple of scrapes which nearly led to discovery in the lead-up to the escape. Both of them and Lee felt throughout that the sooner they got out, the greater the chances of being discovered; the others warned against impatience but agreed that the participants should as far as possible be in control. ===Escape=== On 11 December 1979 the three escapees managed to execute their master plan, against all odds, and found themselves outside the prison, in civilian clothes. Lee, having many friends in Johannesburg, thought it best to contact them in the first instance, so the group split at that point, making plans to meet in London. Moumbaris and Jenkin, by a variety of means, travelled overland to Swaziland and went to United Nations High Commission for Refugees, who were sympathetic to their plight and took them to an ANC representative. Thence to Mozambique, and, via contact with FRELIMO, to Angola, where from the ANC office in Luanda they were able to make phone calls to their families, and were also given the news that Lee was on his way to join them at the airport. On 30 December they were flown to Zambia, where they were accommodated under armed guard in Lusaka and their presence was officially announced by the ANC in early January 1980. Here they met Oliver Tambo and Alfred Nzo, President and Secretary-General of the ANC respectively, and gave a press conference on 2 January 1980. From there they were flown to Dar-es-Salaam in Tanzania, accompanied by MK commander, Joe Modise. On 9 January Moumbaris left for France and was welcomed upon arrival in Paris by Marie-José (whom he had not seen for seven years), his mother, 7-year-old son Boris, and many friends and well-wishers. ===Life after prison=== By escaping, Moumbaris had reduced his sentence by five and a half years. Two years later, Marie-José gave birth to a daughter, Zoë, who was born on 11 December 1981, the second anniversary of the escape. In Paris, Moumbaris organised the opening of the ANC office in 1981 and continued to assist the struggle against apartheid in various ways, including recruiting comrades for missions in South Africa for MK. With bills to pay, he took a job as computer specialist with a subsidiary of the Société Générale and became a shop steward for the Confédération Générale du Travail (CGT). In the 1990s he and others created an association dedicated to the memory of Joseph Stalin, later dissolved but re- formed, for his role in creating socialism, with free health and education. In March 1988, Moumbaris was at the side of ANC Chief Representative Dulcie September in 1988 when she was shot and killed outside the office in Paris. In May 2011, Moumbaris was charged with making a \\"Public call to discrimination\\" and set to appear in court in Flers, in Normandy. He was accused of having published, in the Press Newsletter (BIP), the article \\"Boycott Divestment Sanctions (BDS) 2010\\", summing up the activities and successes of the BDS campaign during 2010. The French Communist Party published a press release in his support on 20 May 2011. Commenting on the 2017 French election, Moumbaris named François Asselineau as his favourite candidate, but that he would vote for Marine Le Pen rather than Emmanuel Macron, purely based on protection of the nation against Macron's \\"financial fascism\\", but was still a staunch communist. Moumbaris was still living in Normandy . In June 2018, he was received by South African ambassador Rapu Molekane at the embassy in Paris. ==Recognition== *2012 - Sabotage Campaign Medal *2014 - Order of the Companions of OR Tambo, Silver, \\"For his excellent contribution in the struggle for liberation\\". ==In TV and film== In 2013, the story of the prison escape was dramatised in the 7th episode of the 2nd season of Breakout, a television series made by National Geographic TV channel dramatising real-life prison escapes.

It was the largest scandal to hit the K-pop industry. The allegations of sex crimes involved added to the country's \\"epidemic\\" of what is called molka, a Korean word for the online distribution of unconsented sex videos taken of women, and the scandal became fodder for political parties, who argued over how to handle it. It began on January 28, 2019, when MBC Newsdesk reported a November 2018 alleged assault of a male clubgoer at the Burning Sun, a prominent nightclub in Gangnam, by a staff member. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency investigation soon turned to one concerning the club's alleged involvement in prostitution, drug trafficking and police corruption. Seungri of the band Big Bang, one of the club's directors, subsequently resigned from the entertainment industry on March 11, 2019, after being charged with sex bribery. The scandal quickly encompassed allegations of rape and spy cams when singer and entertainer Jung Joon-young confessed to secretly filming himself having sex with women and sharing the videos, without their knowledge or consent, in the Jung Joon-young KakaoTalk chatrooms, and he resigned from the entertainment industry on March 12. While looking into the Burning Sun scandal, SBS funE had discovered videos dated from 2015 to 2016, as well as conversations he shared in chat groups on the social media app KakaoTalk with Seungri, and acquaintances. The chatroom exposé immediately affected a few celebrities, and more as the case developed. On March 14, Yong Jun-hyung of Highlight and Choi Jong-hoon of F.T. Island resigned from their positions, after allegations they were participants in the chatrooms, and the agency for Lee Jong-hyun of CNBLUE admitted his involvement on March 15. On International Women's Day on March 8, the scandal led to a street protest in Gangnam against the Burning Sun and other nightclubs, calling for an end to what the protesters called a culture that treats women as sexual objects. Although thousands of women had rallied in 2018 against illicit filming and sharing, the allegations against the idealized image of pop idols still surprised the public. The serious nature of the scandal prompted a response from President Moon Jae-in, who ordered a thorough investigation. Although most of the criminal investigations generated by the scandal were concluded by the end of 2019, final legal proceedings for defendants, including trials and appeals, continued into 2020, with Seungri's own case referred to a military trial scheduled in the fall. ==Burning Sun nightclub== Closed entrance of Club Burning Sun, Le Méridien Hotel, Gangnam. March 27, 2019. The Burning Sun nightclub, (Hangul: 클럽 버닝썬, Club Burning Sun), opened at the Le Méridien Seoul hotel in Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu, on February 23, 2018, and closed during the investigation of the scandal on February 17, 2019. The upscale hotel had just replaced the Ritz Carlton Hotel and opened in September 2017, months before the Burning Sun's opening. The nightclub was often called \\"Seungri's Club\\", due to its affiliation with K-pop idol Seungri of Big Bang. The Burning Sun advertised itself as, “the most elegant and finest club in South Korea\\". It included a basement level for EDM, a second level for hip hop, VVIP admittance, 60 VIP tables near the DJ box and stage, spacious dance floors and accommodation for 1000 guests. The drink menu listed Armand de Brignac champagne and Louis XIII cognac sets, priced in the thousands of dollars. The sound system was set up by Funktion-One, a specialized overseas company, whose sound expert, Tony Andrews, was invited to the club for sound tuning. Seungri served as one of the DJs, along with other local and visiting guest artists like R3hab. The club's CEOs were Lee Moon-ho and Lee Sung-hyun, a former board member of the company that operated the Le Méridien Seoul hotel. Seungri was one of seven in-house directors, and resigned from his position in January 2019. Seungri was the co-founder of Yuri Holdings, a shareholder of Burning Sun Entertainment that operated the club. which owned as much as 20 percent in shares, and which was established in March 2016, with Yoo In-seok, to manage his restaurant and entertainment businesses. Seungri resigned from his position in mid February and Yoo resigned on March 13. Seungri described his relationship to the club in an interview with The Chosun Ilbo, published on March 22, 2019, saying that CEO Lee Moon-ho, a friend of his, was the operator of the club and in charge, while Seungri's name was used for marketing, after his initial investment of 10 million won (around US$8,800). In the interview, Seungri said the breakdown of Burning Sun's shares were as follows: owners of Le Méridien Seoul, 42 percent; Lee Sung-hyun (CEO of Le Méridien Seoul), 8 percent; Yuri Holdings, 20 percent, Madam Lin (Taiwanese investor), 20 percent; and Lee Moon-ho, 10 percent. ===Other clubs=== Monkey Museum was the first Gangnam club to associate Seungri's name, and opened on July 27, 2016, in the upscale neighborhood of Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu. It was a trendy hip hop lounge-style bar, co-owned by Seungri, Yoo and a group of K-pop singers. During the scandal's investigation, it became one of the first non-relevant charges against Seungri, of illegal operation as a bar, while it was registered as a restaurant; and later involved allegations of embezzlement of funds by Seungri and Yoo. Arena (or Club Arena) was a dance club that opened in 2014 in Nonhyeon-dong, Gangnam-gu. It was known as a TV and sports celebrity hang-out, had a reputation for a very strict dress code, and could accommodate 700 guests with separate EDM and hip hop dance floors. It was another club Seungri was affiliated with, and where he was alleged to have made arrangements for investors to receive sexual favors. The owner, last name Kang, and another of the club's operators, were arrested on tax evasion charges during the scandal's investigation. ===Seungri's background as a businessman=== The club's scandal was heightened in the media, exacerbated by Seungri's wide popularity and his possible business connections to it. He had developed a second career in business, and the nightclub business was not his first business venture, having been preceded by several others: a Japanese ramen restaurant chain, cosmetics, a Belgian waffle cafe, and a record company co-founded with his agency YG Entertainment. He invested in biotechnology and nanotechnology and the development of masks for yellow dust protection. and failed at real estate and electronic businesses. He closed his successful vocal and dance academy, the Joy Dance – Plug In Music Academy, which he first opened in 2011, in his home town of Gwangju, with branches around South Korea, after some parents complained about an \\"overly friendly\\" teacher-student relationship at one location. In November 2018, he entered the IT sector when he became the Creative Director and model for HeadRock VR, a franchise brand of the AR product company SocialNetwork and affiliate Mediafront; and assisted in the opening of the Headrock VR theme park in Singapore. Seungri who used a stage name that means \\"victory\\" in Korean, his real name is Lee Seung-hyun, at the age of 28, was the youngest member of Big Bang; having debuted at age 15. Just before the scandal broke, he released his first solo Korean language studio album in July 2018, and was conducting his first solo tour, The Great Seungri, after 13 years as a group member. He was filling the void for the band's hiatus while all remaining four members were in military service, and waiting for his own enlistment in March. Jessica Oak at Billboard wrote, \\"Seungri has forged and built an empire all his own during his 13 years in the industry. The superstar has become known as a thriving entrepreneur with business ventures in food, nightlife and music labels\\". He had been the subject of a popular TV show on SBS, about his life and businesses, filmed \\"speaking four languages and throwing lavish parties in luxury resorts.\\" In August 2018, Baik Su-jin, a journalist at The Chosun Ilbo, described his story, among other rich celebrities, as a \\"rags-to-riches\\" story, adding that Seungri was a late bloomer in the spotlight, only coming into his own after the other Big Bang members were absent. Seungri said, \\"I had a tough time outshining other members of the group, so I studied foreign languages.\\" He said he had tried to succeed at business, in part, because he felt \\"overlooked and underappreciated\\" by fans, being the youngest of the famous group, and business was a place where he would not have to compete with the other band members. Seungri said his popularity had been a business asset and he had looked for partners that would benefit from it.\\" His last studio album The Great Seungri was a play on his nickname, from the novel The Great Gatsby. After his involvement in the scandal, a popular culture critic in Seoul, Lee Moon-won, said \\"the multilingual Seungri\\", with \\"has multiple business interests\\" had been seen as an “ideal cultural export”, deemed to be a hard- worker by his fans. Lee pointed out the irony of Seungri's having been found to be thoroughly comparable to The Great Gatsby protagonist, not only for his good looks, business acumen, and lavish parties, but because both had sought \\"illicit and corrupt activities to gain fame and wealth.\\" ====Seungri's friends and scandal participants==== Seungri was close to celebrity friends Jung Joon-young, age 30, and Choi Jong-hoon, age 29, who joined him when his agency YG Entertainment launched their newest YG Republique restaurant in August 2017, in Kuala Lumpur. Jung, a singer-songwriter and television celebrity, and the key person in the illicit sex video portion of the scandal, had been a friend of Seungri for several years. In 2015, he showed off their relationship by telephoning Seungri for a chat during a live radio broadcast. In August 2018, Seungri joined him on the travel show Salty Tour, where Jung was a main cast member, and made comments that generated disciplinary actions by the Korea Communications Standards Commission due to their gender insensitivity or potential \\"sexual harassment\\". During a broadcast episode on a trip to Xiamen, China, Seungri asked a female guest to pick a favorite amongst the five male cast members and pour them a drink; which viewers complained about. ==Development== Le Meridien Hotel, Gangnam, location of Club Burning Sun. ===January 28, Kim Sang-kyo assault at Burning Sun reported=== The first public awareness of the Burning Sun scandal was on January 28, 2019, when MBC Newsdesk reported on an alleged assault of a 29-year-old clubgoer, Kim Sang-kyo, at the Burning Sun nightclub. Kim said he was attempting to help a woman who was being sexually harassed, but staff had assaulted him. When the Yeoksam police arrived, he was arrested as the assailant and booked on seven charges, including criminal battery, an indecent act, defamation and the obstruction of the performance of official duties. He said the police assaulted him after he was placed under arrest. The incident occurred on November 24, 2018, but came to media attention in January 2019, after Kim posted a petition on the Cheong Wa Dae website detailing his assault by Burning Sun staffers and mistreatment by police; and further stating that female customers were drugged by staffers and the club had a corrupt relationship with district police. Another current petition on the website called for the investigation of the club scene, in general, and druggings occurring there. Cheong Wa Dae is a petition website based on former President Obama's We the People, and which was launched in August 2017, on President Moon's 100th day in office. Kim's petition had received the benchmark 200,000 signatures prompting an official response. ====Initial allegations at Burning Sun==== During the early stages, the scandal evolved around Kim's complaint against the Burning Sun nightclub, including any possible crimes that may have occurred there, and the identities of responsible parties. The initial January 28 report of the Kim incident, by MBC Newsdesk, had included two CCTV videos of the club's security footage purportedly showing Kim's assault inside the club, and a second one showing a woman being dragged down a hallway, and alleged to have been drugged. A KBS report soon added that an alleged former employee had talked about illegal drug use in the club's VIP rooms. An additional report by MBC, on February 14, included allegations of a purported VIP client of the club, who said staff solicited him in text messages, offering women who were available for sex, after readying them with date rape drugs. He claimed to have received a video clip from staff, showing \\"an intoxicated woman being raped\\". By January 31, 2019, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency (SMPA) had taken charge of the investigation, which included allegations of local Gangnam police corruption and collusion with the club's owners, and had assigned a team to look into the club's allegations of sexual violence, drug use, Kim's arrest and any connection with the local police station. The SMPA said their quick response and follow-up investigation was due to media attention garnered by the Big Bang K-pop group member Seungri's affiliation with the club. They also said they had expanded their probe of drug-related allegations to all Gangnam clubs, due to club marketing by independent \\"merchandisers\\" or \\"MDs\\" for many different clubs. Seungri's involvement and his relationship to the nightclub immediately became a hot media issue. Yang Hyun-suk the chief of his agency, YG Entertainment, released a statement on January 31, that Seungri had been at the club on November 28, but left before Kim's incident occurred. He also said Seungri's recent resignation as a senior director of the club was due to his upcoming military enlistment. Seungri's delayed response to the controversy was in an Instagram statement on February 2, stating that he was not present at the club during Kim's alleged assault, had belatedly heard about it, and served as an executive director for the club and had no part in the club's operation or management; but he, however, apologized that he had not taken responsibility from the beginning. ===February 26, first KakaoTalk messages revealed=== On February 26, 2019, SBS FunE released the first portions of the KakaoTalk recordings that would become crucial in the investigation, saying their origin was an anonymous source which had turned them over to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission on February 22. The recordings dated back to 2015, and seemed to implicate Seungri with allegations that he had directed Burning Sun staff to arrange prostitutes for foreign investors who were coming to Seoul, at another Gangnam nightclub. The source had cited possible police collusion as the reason for not turning them over directly to police. The police held a press conference on March 4, saying they had not seen the original, unedited KakaoTalk messages and doubted their veracity, just prior to an SBS report detailing how they had obtained them. On February 27, Seungri was questioned by the SMPA, a lengthy interview that lasted overnight and included a drug test. Seungri denied allegations of attempts to buy sex for potential foreign investors (or sex for business favors) and any knowledge of the KakaoTalk messages, which had been disclosed by media, conversations he allegedly had with a Burning Sun co-founder and another of its employees about such arrangements; and he denied drug use. Media reports said that various nightclubs were used for the lobbying, including one named Arena, where Seungri allegedly arranged sexual favors for investors. In one alleged chat conversation between Seungri and his business partners in December 2015, Seungri says, \\"Give B (the anonymous investor) everything she wants. Get a hold of the main [rooms] 3 and 4 at the [club] Arena. We have guests from Taiwan\\". After confirming arrangements with a man surnamed Kim, Seungri asked, \\"“And what about the girls? [Give them] the easy girls.” Yoo answered, “I’m getting the prostitutes ready, so if you get two prostitutes, then lead them to the hotel rooms. Two is good?” ====Seungri booked==== On March 10, Seungri was booked on sex bribery charges. The following day, he resigned from entertainment on his Instagram account, stating that he had caused a \\"societal disturbance\\" and said he would cooperate with the investigation. ===March 11, Jung Joon-young KakaoTalk chatrooms and source revealed=== The source of the KakaoTalk messages was revealed to be a lawyer, Bang Jung-hyun, on March 11, when he was interviewed on SBS Eight O'Clock News. He had obtained the messages from a whistleblower or \\"anonymous source\\", possibly a technician at a phone repair shop, where singer and entertainer Jung Joon-young had dropped his phone off for repairs. The whistleblower had sent an email to Bang, of thousands of chats taken from Jung's phone, which took place over eight months between 2015 and 2016. When the Burning Sun scandal started, the phone messages were forwarded to the Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission and to SBS FunE; and the secretly filmed sex tapes and other chat messages on Jung's phone became public. During the SBS interview, the integrity of the chat room file was discussed, and was said to have a tamper-proof device, technically a hash-code verification, showing that the file had not been manipulated; and could stand as circumstantial evidence to seek more evidence. Bang, an economics graduate of Seoul National University, and a practicing lawyer, said of the chats, \\"Their conversations showed that there were not only sex crimes by celebrities, but also a cozy relationship between them and top police officers,\\" and \\"It is someone higher up than [the Gangnam Police Precinct chief].\\" Traffic on Bongeunsa-ro, Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam. Le Meridien Hotel, location of Club Burning Sun on left. Also, on Monday, March 11, due to possible police involvement, the Commission, a watchdog agency, turned the records over to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office of the Republic of Korea, asking them to investigate the scandal instead of the police. Within a week, the case was transferred to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office who said they would assign a team to direct the SMPA's investigation. Also, due to the new allegations of possible police misconduct, on March 14, Commissioner Min Gap-ryong of the Korean National Police Agency (KNPA) reported to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security at the National Assembly, that \\"A total of 126 agents will be assigned to investigate the nightclub Burning Sun, the assault at Club Arena, drug use, ties with the police, and allegations of brokering prostitution, filming and distributing illegal videos, among other things\\". President Moon ordered an investigation of the scandal on March 18, to include two past sex scandal cases; the first one involved a former vice justice minister, Kim Hak-ui, who was cleared of a scandal in 2013, but had new allegations of raping women and appearing in sex videos with them, and the second one was the 2009 suicide of rookie actress Jang Ja-yeon, whose purported suicide note included a list of men who she was forced to have sex with, by her entertainment agency. The handling of those cases had been criticized for nonimpartiality due to the involvement of high-profile figures. He said, \\"The current leadership of the prosecution and police should stake the fate of their organizations with responsibility on uncovering the truth and becoming a law enforcement agency that can reveal its own shameful acts so as to regain trust,\\" and \\"I am stressing that if we cannot fix it, we cannot call this society a just one.\\" Ha Hyun-ock, a deputy financial news editor of the JoongAng Ilbo likened the burgeoning events to the mafia, with allegations of \\"drug dealing, prostitution, violence, tax evasion and collusion with police\\". He referred to the assessment Bang brought up on the SBS news program, of its being the beginning of a Korean mafia, with K-pop's popularity creating celebrities of new money and status, who hobnob with business and government connections. Seungri's and Jung's inter-locking scandals were combined in public televised view when both were called into the SMPA station on March 14, with more than 100 journalists gathered for Jung's 10 a.m. appearance. It consisted of his arrival, and apology, before entering the station for questioning and a drug test; followed similarly by Seungri, some three hours later. Police also questioned Seungri's business partner and Yuri Holdings CEO Yoo In-seok. Seungri exited first, at around 6:15 a.m. on March 15, some 16 hours later, and he told reporters, as he exited, that he would be putting in a request to delay his mandatory military service later in the month. Jung exited, about an hour later, after his 21-hour interrogation. ===April 1 – end of year=== ====Seungri's business partner admits to hiring prostitutes, and first arrest warrant fails==== On April 1, SMPA announced they had booked Seungri and Yoo for allegations of embezzlement from the Monkey Museum club, which they opened in 2016. Later allegations stated that funds from Yuri Holdings were used to pay attorney fees for a criminal case involving an employee of the club. On April 29, a Chosun Ilbo headline, \\"Seung-ri's Business Partner Admits Pimping\\", followed Seungri and Yoo's new questioning by SMPA, in which Seungri continued to deny any involvement with prostitution, and Yoo finally admitted that he supplied prostitutes to six or more Japanese investors at their Gangnam nightclub in December 2015. SMPA had paper trails of money transactions, a YG Entertainment credit card payment by Seungri and a wire transfer by Yoo, and chat room conversations the two had with Jung about the arrangements; and had booked 17 prostitutes and pimps related to the incidents. Seungri was summoned for questioning about alleged embezzlement of the Burning Sun club's funds for the first time, on May 2, following sixteen prior interrogations about his alleged arrangement of sexual services for investors. MBC TV covering a Burning Sun protest rally, Le Méridien Hotel subway exit, Gangnam, May 25, 2019. On May 7 SMPA requested arrest warrants, to include pre-trial detention, for Seungri and Yoo, and they appeared at May 14 hearings, on charges of embezzling company funds and arranging sexual services for foreign investors, along with a new charge that Seungri had paid for sexual services himself. Seungri admitted that he received illicit sex services but denied all other allegations at the Seoul Central District Court hearing, and was led to a holding cell in ropes to await the decision, which came later in the evening, when both arrest warrants were denied, with the court citing \\"room for dispute\\" over the alleged embezzlement, and said the possibility of destroying evidence was slim. SMPA referred Seungri's case to prosecutors on June 25, with charges related to 1.1 billion won (US$951,000) in embezzlement, destruction of evidence, violation of laws on sex trade, sexual crimes and food hygiene. Allegations included procuring prostitutes for himself and for others from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan from December 2015 to January 2016. His business partner Yoo was also referred to prosecutors for procuring prostitutes. MBC TV's May 27 show Straight introduced new allegations and another celebrity name to the scandal. It alleged that YG Entertainment's founder Yang Hyun-suk had arranged sexual services for foreign investors in July 2014, which he and the company denied. SMPA began an investigation based on the show's details of an alleged dinner meeting in Gangnam and a trip to a nightclub NB, affiliated with Yang, that included Yang, age 50, a Malaysian fugitive Jho Low, age 38, a Thai national named Bob (Chavanos Rattakul), a YG singer, a Madam Jung, Hwang Ha-na; and as many as 10 prostitutes, who allegedly provided sexual services at the nightclub. Singer Psy, age 42, who was with YG Entertainment at the time, released a statement that he had introduced his friend Jho Low to Yang, and admitted that he and Yang had been invited to the dinner and drinks with Low and the other man. Allegations also referenced a December 2018 rape complaint at the Burning Sun against Rattakul, one of the foreign investors also affiliated with Seungri, and who had been summoned by police. In June, Yang was questioned by police about the prostitution allegations but not taken in as a suspect and Psy was questioned as a witness about the July 2014 incident, which statute of limitations was soon to expire. On July 17, SMPA reported having booked Yang for allegations of arranging sexual services for the foreign investors in 2014, along with three more suspects for prostitution allegations; but dropped the charges against Yang on September 20, stating that they had failed to prove them. A prior allegation of Seungri's possible gambling overseas was reignited by an August 9, JTBC report alleging instances of Yang and Seungri having gambled up to 1 to 2 billion won at the MGM Grand Las Vegas on past occasions. SMPA said they were examining Yang's financial records for possible illegal foreign exchange transactions that may have been used for his alleged gambling, which is illegal for South Koreans at home and abroad. On August 14, both Yang and Seungri were booked on charges of habitual gambling, and by August 20, charges included illegal foreign trade transactions and a travel ban had been imposed. On August 28 and 29, both were questioned and Seungri admitted to gambling, but denied allegations of illegally securing funds, in violation of the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. Seungri was questioned again on September 24 and Yang on October 1. On October 31, SMPA said they would be referring Yang and Seungri, along with three others, for prosecution of alleged habitual gambling, for a time period from the second half of 2014 to the present. In the first case with allegations of police collusion, a former Gangnam police officer surnamed Kang, age 44, was sentenced to one year in prison on August 14. During the trial co-CEO Lee Sung-hyun testified that he paid 20 million won (US$17,000) to Kang to cover for an underage clubgoer incident at the Burning Sun and had not discussed the arrangements with Seungri. In drug related cases, on August 22, co-CEO Lee Moon-ho received a suspended sentence of three years probation and community service for a year and a half prison term in a habitual drug use case where he pled guilty, but at a second trial on November 28, was sentenced to one year in prison with charges of using more than 10 drugs, including ecstasy and ketamine in Gangnam clubs from 2018 through February 2019. The court said that Lee Moon-ho's position as the operator of the Burning Sun Club put him at a different level than an \\"ordinary drug offender\\" and his first sentencing had been \\"light and unfair\\". A senior police official, Yoon Gyu- geun, age 49, referred to as the \\"police chief\\" in the chatrooms, was arrested on October 10, on charges of accepting bribes and misuse of power, among others, following a search at his KNPA office in September. Yoon was referred for prosecution in June for allegedly informing Seungri and Yoo In-seok of police crackdowns, but the late search and focus on Yoon was questioned by a The Korea Times report by Lee Suh-yoon as possibly being related to his having worked in the Blue House in 2017 under Justice Minister Cho Kuk, who was being investigated in a separate case. A businessman named Jeong, a possible link between Yoon and Yoo was arrested earlier on embezzlement charges. Yoon was indicted on October 29, on charges of bribery, obstruction of business, and concealing evidence, among others, related to allegations of attempting to cover up illegalities at the Burning Sun and other businesses run by Seungri and Yoo. Yoon was also alleged to have received unlisted stocks from businessman Jeong in relation to the case; while Jeong is suspected of being tied to illicit financial transactions in the separate case against ex-Justice Minister Cho. A Burning Sun employee, an MD named Cho, age 28, one of the first investigated in the club's scandal, was sentenced to four years and six months imprisonment in early December for smuggling and administering drugs. ====Other investigations==== SMPA announced on May 15 they had referred the original whistleblower of the club's scandal, Kim Sang-kyo, to the prosecution for indictment for sexually assaulting three women and obstructing the business. In early July, the government responded to an April 11 Cheong Wa Dae petition which had detailed new allegations at the Burning Sun club, which was followed by a report on MBC TV's Straight. Witnesses interviewed on the program alleged \\"underage sex trafficking and violent sexual abuse of women\\", claiming VIP rooms at the club and offsite were set up for customers, including those from upperclass Korean families, and a special clean-up crew called the \\"incinerators\\" were employed to remove blood and incriminating evidence. The petition which received the required signatures, asked for the investigation of an alleged group rape by six men in one of the VIP rooms, of a woman who had been given GHB, called \\"mulpong\\" in South Korea. In late June, BBC News reporter Laura Bicker shared similar allegations of Gangnam's nightlife, \\"in its glitzy nightclubs, women have been drugged to order by powerful men and raped\\" and \\"underage girls are being sexually exploited for profit\\". On July 9, KNPA Commissioner Min responded that the allegations of sexual abuse and drug use in the VIP rooms, per the petition, were not confirmed. He added, \\"I will humbly accept the public's criticism that the results of the investigation are insufficient in relation to the Burning Sun case\\". On July 17, SMPA held a preventive meeting at the Seodaemun-gu police offices to discuss a \\"Second Burning Sun Club Opening\\", after a KBS report detailed possible new problems of sexual harassment at a new club in the Gangnam area, opened by former employees of the Burning Sun club, just four months after it closed down. Also, as part of an anti-corruption initiative established at the troubled Gangnam Police Station, SMPA announced an unprecedented open recruitment just for that police station in mid July, after 164 officers were transferred to other departments. A newly formed three month joint response team was also set up to investigate club illegal activity in Gangnam, from August through October, to prevent a new Burning Sun incident. On September 10, SMPA's Cyber Security Division referred charges of defamation and pornography for twelve participants in an investigation of media personnel which began on May 3. A Cheong Wa Dae petition was filed, alleging that a chat group of about 200 reporters, producers and media staffers had shared illicit video clips of incidents that had occurred at the Burning Sun, as well as information about brothels and prostitutes. On September 29, Lee Jae-jung, a member of the National Assembly Public Administration and Security Committee released SMPA data showing that 12 of 40 police officers involved in the initial assault allegations of Kim Sang-kyo and afterwards had been disciplined, with any actions pending for key figures, such as Yoon. Lee criticized the results as \\"very disappointing\\" and \\"far from the public's expectation\\". ===January 8, 2020 – present=== ====Seungri second arrest warrant fails, prosecution indicts without arrest==== On January 8, 2020, seven months after police had submitted their case, the prosecution filed a second warrant requesting Seungri's arrest on seven charges – procuring prostitution for himself and others (29 times for foreign investors between September 2015 and January 2016), embezzlement (about $17,000 from Yuri Holdings), habitual gambling in Las Vegas (for a period of three years and six months since 2013), illegal currency transactions, violation of the Food Sanitation Law (at Monkey Museum club), and sharing three unconsented nude photos of women via mobile messenger. No other warrants for his business partner Yoo, or any others involved, were requested. The court denied the request at a hearing on January 13, saying detention was not warranted based on Seungri's \\"role and involvement in wrongdoings\\" and \\"his attitude toward the prosecution's investigation\\". On January 30, prosecutors indicted nine people, without detention, for allegations of crimes related to the Burning Sun case, including: Seungri for mediating prostitution, gambling, and violation of the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act, Yoo In-seok for mediating prostitution and business embezzlement, and Yang Hyun-suk for gambling and violation of the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act. Another two, Jung Joon- young and Choi Jong-hoon, who were already imprisoned after a rape trial in 2019, were indicted for allegations of soliciting prostitution and for bribery of a police officer in a drunk driving incident, respectively. On February 7, former police officer Kang's trial conviction and sentencing in August 2019 for police collusion in the admittance of an underage customer at the Burning Sun club was overturned by an appeals court, based on lack of evidence showing that Kang had received the money. On April 3, four of the nine people charged with prostitution allegations received a summary judgment, with Jung Joon- young fined one million won and the Burning Sun's prior MD Kim fined two million won. On April 25, the so-called \\"police chief\\" Yoon Gyu-geun, previously arrested in the fall of 2019 for allegations of bribery and mediating favors for the Burning Sun club, among others, was acquitted of all charges by a Seoul Central District trial court due to the prosecution's lack of evidence, although the court said, \\"It is not that the accused is 100 percent innocent or that the charges are not true.\\" At a June 3 court hearing, Yoo admitted to all charges, including those related to prostitution and embezzlement. At trial on June 22, Yoo again admitted to most of the charges, but denied intentionality, in particular in the embezzlement charge. His charges include allegations of sex trafficing a total of twenty-four times to foreign investors from 2015 to 2016 to open the Burning Sun club. At a court hearing on September 9, Yang admitted to the gambling charges involving about 400 million won (around US$335,000) in Las Vegas casinos approximately twenty times between 2015 and 2019; with the next hearing scheduled for October 28. At a court date for Yoo on October 14, the questioning of duplicate witnesses for both the civilian trial and military trial for Seungri was discussed. ====Seungri's military trial==== After the conclusion of the criminal investigation and indictment in civil court, on February 4, Seungri, who had already turned 30 (Korean age) received a final notification for his mandatory military service by the Military Manpower Administration. Their statement said they were \\"concerned a protracted trial in civilian courts\\" might restrict the military obligation and the case against him would be referred to a military court for trial. Seungri joined the military on March 9, and on May 15, his trial was transferred from the Seoul Central District Court to a military court, with the civilian court trial for a remaining six defendants, including Yoo In-seok, scheduled to proceed separately. At his first hearing at the Ground Operations Command's General Military Court in Yongin on September 16, Seungri denied all the charges except for the violations of the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act. A second court date on October 14 listed some twenty-two witnesses scheduled to testify. ==Investigative reporting== SBS VIP bus, Bukchon Hanok Village, Seoul. The SBS investigative reporter who examined the KakaoTalk chat messages sent by the whistleblower to the television station SBS funE was Kang Kyung-yoon. Her previous work included reporting on the corruption cases related to former President Park Geun-hye. When she started interviewing some of the victims of the videos, she found they did not know of their existence. She said, “Some of them begged, ‘Please save me. How do I live after this?’” She said they were ashamed and angry but feared \\"wearing a scarlet letter as a sex crime victim\\", and thus feared being identified. Kang said that the sex video investigation was seen by some people as a means to avert attention away from the larger corruption scandal with its multiple allegations, but she perceived it as a serious social issue that needed reporting on. At the end of March 2019, Seungri told the director of SBS's investigative program, Unanswered Questions, in a text message, that the lawyer whistleblower and journalist were responsible for all the criminal allegations against him, had not checked facts properly and had \\"ruined his career for their own personal gain\\". In June, the production team of Unanswered Questions (also called I Want to Know) received the Seoul City's Gender Equality Award Grand Prize, in part for their coverage of the scandal. ==Investigation summary== Korean National Police Agency KNPA, press bus, Jongno-gu, Seoul. During the course of the investigation, SMPA focused on the Burning Sun club and its affiliates. Police conducted searches at the Burning Sun club, at the homes of CEO Moon and a sales executive Han, as well as at Burning Sun Entertainment, YG Entertainment, Yuri Holdings, Junwon Industries and Club Arena (and at the Seoul Regional Office of the National Tax Service of South Korea related to allegations of tax evasion). The investigation found a 2.45 billion won (US$2.15 million) investment to the Burning Sun, with the Taiwanese investor having contributed 1 billion won and Seungri having contributed 225 million won. Yonhap News Agency reported that one of the club's investors, perhaps Junwon Industries (also called Cheonwon Industry and a major shareholder in Burning Sun Entertainment which operated Burning Sun), Le Méridien Seoul's operator, may have forged a connection with the hotel, in the amount of $8.8 million, using the intermediary firm to attract larger investments to the club. Junwon CEO Choi Tae-young was charged with embezzling funds, along with Seungri and Yoo. A Burning sun employee Ahn, who worked as a female Taiwanese investor's Korean guide, was booked for embezzlement charges, and the possibility of any Triad investments or organized crime connections were investigated with Interpol and other agencies. Burning Sun's female Taiwanese investor Lin was also booked on charges of embezzlement, in collusion with Seungri and Yoo. Seungri was investigated for allegedly: supplying prostitutes for investors, sharing an illicit photo of a woman in Jung's chatroom, giving concert tickets to a police officer Yoon, and embezzlement of funds from the clubs Monkey Museum and the Burning Sun. Seungri's business partner and CEO of Yuri Holdings, Yoo In-seok, age 34, was investigated for connections to Gangnam police officer Yoon, embezzling Monkey Museum and the Burning Sun's funds, and for supplying prostitutes, along with Seungri. CEO's Lee Sung-hyun and Lee Moon-ho, both age 29, were investigated for allegedly hiring minors as security guards and for bribing former Gangnam police officer Kang with 20 million won (US$17,700) to cover up an underage drinking issue at the club, the latter which Lee Sung-hyun admitted to doing, at a hearing for Kang. YG head Yang and singer Psy were questioned about additional allegations of sex-for-favors involving Yang and foreign guests Jho Low and Chavanos Rattakul. Arrests related to Burning Sun included CEO Lee Moon-ho who was detained and charged with drug use and distributing drugs to Burning Sun customers. Others included a Burning Sun board member Jang, the alleged attacker of clubgoer Kim Sang-kyo, a chat group member named Kim who distributed illicit videos, and a Club Arena security guard Yoon, accused of attacking a guest in 2017. A Chinese promoter, nicknamed Anna, age 26, was investigaed for drug use and distribution, but no arrest was made. An owner of Arena, Kang Mo, age 46, and a \\"puppet head\\" of the club, surnamed Lin, were arrested on charges of tax evasion, alleged to have not paid taxes in the amount of 16.2 billion won (US$14.31 million) between 2014–2017. On April 11, SMPA said 59 persons had been apprehended related to drug use and distribution charges in the Burning Sun scandal, and 11 were under arrest. Former Gangnam police officer Kang, age 44, was arrested for allegations of brokering between the Burning Sun and other police officers, and booked for assisting with an underage drinking incident at the Burning Sun, which co-CEO Lee Sung-hyun admitted to paying him for. Police firings and investigations included a senior superintendent Yoon, who knew Yoo, and assisted with the underage drinking incident and Monkey Museum's business zoning violations, and was charged with violating the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act for receiving concert tickets from Seungri. In peripheral investigations, police announced over 500 drug related arrests on March 25, 2019, after declaring \\"total war\\" against drug crime on February 25, due to the scandal at the Burning Sun. Of the 523 arrests for the use and distribution of drugs, 216 were detained. 421 cases, or 82 percent, involved psychotomimetic drugs like GHB, a common date rape drug, and one alleged to have been used at the Burning Sun. On May 30, SMPA reported to have arrested nearly 4,000 people at 148 entertainment establishments on drug related charges in the three month crackdown after the scandal started. Some 920 of those were detained; 886 for drug related crimes, 23 for sexual assault or rape while under the influence of drugs, and 11 for taking illegal videos during drug use. Most were in their 20s and 30s, and about 40 percent of the crimes involved the use of the drug ecstasy. ==Women's issues and public protests== Protest rally, Sinnonhyeon Station Exit 6, (Le Méridien Hotel), Gangnam, May 25, 2019. The scandal ignited public protests early in March, and later, after police attempts to arrest Seungri and Yoo fell through. A May 17 press conference held by women's rights groups, in front of the SMPA, criticized the results of the three month Burning Sun investigation, conducted by some 152 officers, as \\"dismal\\", with allegations of the club's \\"cozy\\" ties with police, and the illegal filming of women and distribution still unresolved. Weekend rallies condemning the investigation's results started at the Blue House on May 19 and in Gangnam on May 25. Lee Taek-kwang, a professor at Kyung Hee University said, “The recent Burning Sun nightclub scandal exposed a culture that exploits women, which has brought about public rage.” Months later, on November 6, members of seven civic and women's groups, including the Green Party Korea and the Korean Cyber Sexual Violence Response Center (KCSVRC) held a press conference and protest in front of the SMPA Jongno-gu building demanding the resignation of KNPA's Commissioner Min Gap-ryong, criticizing the police investigations of the Jang Ja-yeon and Burning sun cases as biased and poorly conducted. The scandal added to ongoing discussions of women's issues in South Korea — gender inequality, the budding Me Too movement in South Korea, feminism, \\"molka\\", prostitution, and the K-pop industry's attitude towards women. South Korea's #MeToo movement began in January 2018 and was followed by a students' #SchoolMeToo, which became the most tweeted social issue in South Korea in 2018, followed by \\"feminism\\", then \\"molka\\", the abbreviation for \\"spy cameras that are hidden in places such as public bathrooms and for the explicit videos later posted on porn sites\\". In July 2018, thousands marched in Seoul against spy cameras and the government responded by hiring workers to monitor public bathrooms, but activists criticized a general dismissive attitude towards the crimes, citing a \\"deeply rooted gender inequality and misogyny in the country\\". A 2018 OECD ranking of the country, at 30 out of 36 for women's employment, exemplifed the country's gender pay gap, while it ranked highly for women's education. Jung's distribution of sex videos was one of the top gender issues talked about on online platforms in South Korea for the first half of 2019, with research showing a growing trend of gender based topics, most in a negative context. Talks included the K-pop industry, which critics had blamed for sexualizing women; Jang Yun-mi, a spokesperson for the Korean Women Lawyer's Association said, “The industry in Korea … is a boys’ club\\". Women's rights activist Bae Bok-ju said of the spycam allegations in the scandal, \\"This case just shows that male K-pop stars are no exception when it comes to being part of this very disturbing reality that exploits women\\". But, Seoul freelance journalist Haeryun Kang opined in The Washington Post, \\"The most recent celebrity scandal has generated fury among so many Korean women not because it is unique but because the story goes far beyond K-pop. The patterns of male behavior feel disturbingly familiar. The gender power dynamics — that often objectify women into sex tools — feel exhaustingly repetitive\\", and said the scandal was more than \\"misogyny and spy cameras\\", but a larger story of the Burning Sun nighclub's \\"alleged involvement in prostitution, drug trafficking and police corruption\\". ==Effects on entertainment industry== Between February 25 and March 15, 2019, five major South Korean entertainment companies lost 17.52 percent in value, with their market value dropping from 3.35 trillion won (around US$2.96 billion) to 2.76 trillion won. Stocks dropped for the \\"big three\\" K-pop management companies: YG Entertainment (Seungri's company), 24.8 percent, SM Entertainment, 20 percent, JYP Entertainment, 5.5 percent; and additional 20 percent drops for Cube Entertainment and FNC Entertainment. But, on April 11, while the scandal was still under investigation, entertainment companies were forecast by experts (FinGuide Inc. and a Hyundai Motor Securities analyst) to post solid profit growth in 2019, with substantial operating profits for the three big labels; while others added that K-pop's financial reliance on YouTube was unlikely to be affected. However, by September 16, YG Entertainment stocks had dropped by nearly half since January 7. Actress Park Han-byul, who married Yoo of Yuri Holdings in 2017, first stated that she knew nothing more than his being Seungri's business partner, but made a public apology on March 19, after it was reported that she and her husband had played golf previously with the high-ranking police offiicial under investigation for collusion with the nightclubs in the scandal. She said she would not leave a major role in the television drama Love in Sadness, despite calls from some viewers for her to do so. YG Entertainment discontinued sales of merchandise featuring Seungri, and major networks and cable companies deleted episodes of programs both Seungri and Jung had appeared in. In another YG Entertainment artist's scandal, on June 12, 2019, idol B.I, whose real name is Kim Han-bin, age 23, a songwriter and leader of K-pop band iKon, quit his group after the media outlet Dispatch revealed 2016 KakaoTalk messages of him attempting to purchase LSD from a suspected drug dealer, which he admitted to. YG Entertainment, still under scrutiny for allegations concerning their former artist Seungri and head Yang in the Burning Sun scandal, quickly ended their contract with B.I, stating their \\"sense of responsibility in managing its associated artists\\"; and Yang resigned from the agency on June 14, amidst allegations of police collusion to cover up the case. Seoul's EDM festivals responded that they would not hold after-parties in 2019 in Gangnam's clubs, due to the Burning Sun police investigation. The festivals were often promoted in association with entertainment clubs and Ultra Korea, Seoul World DJ Festival and Spectrum Dance Music Festival all held after-parties in 2018 at the Burning Sun, among other clubs. An organizer for the largest, Ultra Korea, said that due to the scandal's allegations of sex crimes involving GHB or \\"mulpong\\", and cannabis use at festivals, plans were being made to mobilize detection dogs, bag checks and X-rays for monitoring drug trafficking this year. Gangnam's nightclubs, usually \\"a pilgrimage site for K-pop fans\\", immediately saw a tapering of Chinese tourists, followed by a general decline of customers to nightclubs and lounge bars. Bars that were registered as general restaurants with the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, where dancing is not allowed, a tactic used by clubs in the Burning Sun scandal to avoid paying higher taxes, underwent a strict monitoring, causing a subdued atmosphere with \\"Please do not dance\\" signs posted and police checking in, to enforce the rule. In late October, France's Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs released an informational report (not a travel alert) for travelers to South Korea, advising caution due to reported cases of GHB and assault drugs at clubs in Hongdae, Itaewon and Gangnam, following earlier French media reports of the Burning Sun scandal. After internet users raised rumors about the possible involvement of several actresses in the scandal, Go Joon-hee, who was managed by YG Entertainment in 2015, first objected on social media, then filed a libel suit for defamation against twelve of them, citing damages to her career, and Han Hyo-joo filed a criminal complaint against thirty-three more. Other actresses and their agencies made denials and warned of legal actions, and at least seven (which included college students, the unemployed, construction workers, and one U.S. citizen) were arrested and referred for prosecution. Some scenes from a 2019 South Korean film, Quantum Physics, about a celebrity drug scandal at a nightclub, were filmed at the Burning Sun nightclub before it closed down. Although it was not based on the real-life scandal, Director Lee Sung-tae said he reconsidered one of the film's scenes, as they were editing as it was ongoing. A November 2019 retrospective article, written by Matthew Campbell and Sohee Kim for Bloomberg Businessweek, pointed out that the K-pop industry, in general, had ignored the scandal, with \\"no organized demands for better behavior from male stars or serious discussions about revamping how idols are trained.\\" They quoted a former SM Entertainment executive, Jeong Chang-hwan, on its implicit impact, “It’s a huge lesson in what not to do,” he says. “The best teacher for young idols is to see fellow idols get into a scandal and disappear from the industry.” ==Public response== Allegations of police misconduct and corruption in the scandal added public support to a government proposal to create an independent investigative agency, first announced by President Moon in July 2017, and still undergoing political debate. Proposed to \\"uncover wrongdoing by high-level government officials and their relatives\\", with the power to take over prosecutions, opponents had questioned its own potential for corruption. K-pop fans' reactions were mixed, some called for YG Entertainment to remove Seungri from the group Big Bang for tarnishing the group's image and having used the group's celebrity to promote his business, even waiting outside his agency's office for an explanation. But other fans continued to support him. The public appeared to boycott a noodle chain called Aori Ramen between January and April 2019, according to multiple store owners who filed a compensation lawsuit in July blaming Seungri, who had run and promoted the franchise, for falling sales. Google Korea's most popular domestic searched terms for 2019 included Jung Joon-young ranked at number two over-all, and number one for top public figure; with Burning Sun ranked at number three for domestic news and issues. Yonhap News Agency editors selected the scandal as one of the top ten South Korean news stories of 2019. ==References== ==External links== Category:Scandals in South Korea Category:Entertainment scandals Category:Law enforcement scandals Category:Sex scandals Category:Crime in South Korea Category:Seungri Category:Rape in South Korea ","title":"Burning Sun scandal"},{"id":"60280775","text":"The Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark III is a digital mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera released by Olympus Corporation in September 2017.

In his hometown he was taught by Alice Goldberg, in Vienna by Emilie Auer-Weißgerber, in Bucharest by Albert d'Andrée, in Munich by Rudolf Großmann and in Berlin by Josef Burgwinkel. An engagement of Jungwirth in the Stadttheater Klagenfurt did not come about because he had to do military service. Therefore he had his debut at the Romanian National Opera, Bucharest. Still in 1942 and then again from the end of the war until 1949 he was engaged at the Tyrolean State Theatre, where he also studied musicology and obtained his doctorate in this discipline in 1948.Manfred Jungwirth: Die historische Funktion des Baß-Buffo in stimmtechnischer Beleuchtung, Innsbruck, phil. Diss. 9 Sept. 1950, 91 sheets. From 1949 to 1954 as well as 1958 to 1961 and then 1971 to 1982 he was a permanent guest at the Zurich Opera House. In between 1956/57 also in Staatstheater Wiesbaden, from 1960 to 1968 in Oper Frankfurt and 1967 to 1985 at the Wiener Staatsoper. He mainly sang the bassbuffo parts, including operas by Domenico Cimarosa, Peter Cornelius, Friedrich von Flotow, Albert Lortzing, W. A. Mozart, Richard Strauss, Otto Nicolai, Gioacchino Rossini and Bedřich Smetana. He also took on roles like Rocco in Beethoven's Fidelio, but also some of the roles of Giuseppe Verdi, Richard Wagner and Carl Maria von Weber. Already at the age of 30 he took over the part of Ochs von Lerchenau in Richard Strauss' der Rosenkavalier, which he first sang in Zurich in 1951/52 and then impersonated on all important stages. At the Grand Théâtre de Genève in 1974 he appeared as Osmin in Die Entführung aus dem Serail, in other Swiss theatres as van Bett in Zar und Zimmermann.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It is thought to be the first brick building constructed in Calhoun County. As of 2019, the building operated as a bed and breakfast. ==History== In 1834, local businessman Andrew Mann hired George Bentley and Nathan Benedict to construct a brick hotel. The structure was completed in 1835, and Mann opened the inn by hosting a formal ball on January 1, 1836. Mann leased the inn to another proprietor in 1837, but it continued to prosper as a stop on the Territorial Road to Detroit. By 1837 it was one of three taverns in Marshall, and by 1877 it was one of eight hotels in the area. Around this time an addition was constructed. In 1879, it was sold by Mrs. R. A. Facey, and ceased operating as a hotel. For a time it housed a factory for wagons and windmills, and around 1900 it was purchased by Dr. Andrew Dean, who converted it into an apartment building. It operated as apartments until it was purchased by the Minick and Kinney families in 1976. The new owners refurbished the building, and in 1977 reopened it as the National House Inn. As of 2019, the National House is open as a bed and breakfast. ==Description== The National House is a two story brick hotel on a sandstone foundation with a gable roof. It is built in an L plan, with the main facade fronting onto Parkview and the old Courthouse Square. This facade has a central door opening containing a transom and side panels around the door. Flanking the entrance are two irregularly placed windows. Five window bays run across the second floor. All windows have plain stone lintels and slipsills. On the side, the gable facade of the main rectangle has three windows and a linteled door on the ground floor and four second story windows, with one smaller window located above under the eaves. A gabled four bay extension, which defines the shorter leg of the L, continues the facade. This extension contains openings similar to the main facade. The late 1870s brick addition is a two story, six bay structure adjoining the original section in one corner. ==References== ==External links== *National House Inn Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calhoun County, Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1835 ","title":"National House (Marshall, Michigan)"},{"id":"60280819","text":"In model checking, a subfield of computer science, a clock is a mathematical object used to model time. More precisely, a clock measure how much time passed since a particular event occurs, in this sense, a clock is more precisely an abstraction of a stopwatch. In a model of some particular program, the value of the clock may either be the time since the program was started, or the time since a particular event occurred in the program. Those clocks are used in the definition of timed automaton, signal automaton, timed propositional temporal logic and clock temporal logic. They are also used in programs such as UPPAAL which implement timed automata. Generally, the model of a system uses many clocks. Those multiple clocks are required in order to track a bounded number of events. All of those clocks are synchronized. That means that the difference in value between two fixed clocks is constant until one of them is restarted. In the language of electronics, it means that clock's jitter is null. == Example == Let us assume that we want to modelize an elevator in a building with ten floors. Our model may have n clocks c_{0},\\\\dots,c_{9}, such that the value of the clock c_i is the time someone had wait for the elevator at floor i. This clock is started when someone calls the elevator on floor i (and the elevator was not already called on this floor since last time it visited that floor). This clock can be turned off when the elevator arrives at floor i. In this example, we actually need ten distinct clocks because we need to track ten independent events. Another clock s may be used to check how much time an elevator spent at a particular floor. A model of this elevator can then use those clocks to assert whether the elevator's program satisfies properties such as \\"assuming the elevator is not kept on a floor for more than fifteen seconds, then no one has to wait for the elevator for more than three minutes\\". In order to check whether this statement holds, it suffices to check that, in every run of the model in which the clock s is always smaller than fifteen seconds, each clock c_i is turned off before it reaches three minutes. == Definition == Formally, a set X of clocks is simply a finite set. Each element of a set of clock is called a clock. Intuitively, a clock is similar to a variable in first-order logic, it is an element which may be used in a logical formula and which may takes a number of differente values. === Clock valuations === A clock valuation or clock interpretation u over X=\\\\\\\\{x_1,\\\\dots,x_n\\\\\\\\} is usually defined as a function from X to the set of non-negative real. Equivalently, a valuation can be considered as a point in \\\\mathbb R_{\\\\ge0}^n. The initial assignment u_0 is the constant function sending each clock to 0. Intuitively, it represents the initial time of the program, where each clocks are initialized simultaneously. Given a clock assignment u, and a real t\\\\ge0, u+t denotes the clock assignment sending each clock x\\\\in C to u(x)+t. Intuitively, it represents the valuation u after which t time units passed. Given a subset r\\\\subseteq C of clocks, u[r\\\\rightarrow 0] denotes the assignment similar to u in which the clocks of r are reset. Formally, u[r\\\\rightarrow 0] sends each clock x\\\\in r to 0 and each clock x ot\\\\in r to u(x). === Inactive clocks === The program UPPAAL introduce the notion of inactive clocks. A clock is inactive at some time if there is no possible future in which the clock's value is checked without being reset first. In our example above, the clock c_i is considered to be inactive when the elevator arrive at floor i, and remains inactive until someone call the elevator at floor i. When allowing for inactive clock, a valuation may associate a clock x to some special value \\\\bot to indicate that it is inactive. If u(x)=\\\\bot then ( u+t)(x) also equals \\\\bot. == Clock constraint == An atomic clock constraint is simply a term of the form x\\\\sim c, where x is a clock, \\\\sim is a comparison operator, such as <, ≤, = ≥, or >, and c\\\\in\\\\mathbb N is an integral constant. In our previous example, we may use the atomic clock constraints c_i\\\\le180 to state that the person at floor i waited for less than three minutes, and s>15 to state that the elevator stayed at some floor for more than fifteen seconds. A valuation u satisfies an atomic clock valuation x\\\\sim c if and only if u(x)\\\\sim c. A clock constraint is either a finite conjunction of atomic clock constraint or is the constant \\"true\\" (which can be considered as the empty conjunction). A valuation u satisfies a clock constraint \\\\bigwedge_{i=1}^nx_i\\\\sim_ic_i if it satisfies each atomic clock constraint x_i\\\\sim_ic_i. === Diagonal constraint === Depending on the context, an atomic clock constraint may also be of the form x_i\\\\sim x_j+c. Such a constraint is called a diagonal constraint, because x_1=x_2+c defines a diagonal line in \\\\mathbb R_{\\\\ge0}^2. Allowing diagonal constraints may allow to decrease the size of a formula or of an automaton used to describe a system. However, algorithm's complexity may increase when diagonal constraints are allowed. In most system using clocks, allowing diagonal constraint does not increase the expressivity of the logic. We now explain how to encode such constraint with Boolean variable and non-diagonal constraint. A diagonal constraint x_i\\\\sim x_j+c may be simulated using non- diagonal constraint as follows. When x_j is reset, check whether x_i\\\\sim c holds or not. Recall this information in a Boolean variable b_{i,j,c} and replace x_i\\\\sim x_j+c by this variable. When x_i is reset, set b_{i,j,c} to true if \\\\sim is < or ≤ or if \\\\sim is = and c=0. The way to encode a Boolean variable depends on the system which uses the clock. For example, UPPAAL supports Boolean variables directly. Timed automata and signal automata can encode a Boolean value in their locations. In clock temporal logic over timed words, the Boolean variable may be encoded using a new clock x_{i,j,c}, whose value is 0 if and only if b_{i,j,c} is false. That is, x_{i,j,c} is reset as long as x_{i,j,c} is supposed to be false. In timed propositional temporal logic, the formula x_i.\\\\phi, which restart x_i and then evaluates \\\\phi, can be replaced by the formula x_i.((x_i\\\\sim x_j+c\\\\implies\\\\phi_\\\\top)\\\\land( eg x_i\\\\sim x_j+c\\\\implies\\\\phi\\\\bot)), where \\\\phi_\\\\top and \\\\phi_\\\\bot are copies of the formulas \\\\phi, where x_i\\\\sim x_j+c are replaced by the true and false constant respectively. === Sets defined by clock constraints === A clock constraint defines a set of valuations. Two kinds of such sets are considered in the literature. A zone is a non-empty set of valuations satisfying a clock constraint. Zones and clock constraints are implemented using difference bound matrix. Given a model M, it uses a finite number of constants in its clock constraints. Let K be the greatest constant used. A region is a non-empty zone in which no constraint greater than K are used, and furthermore, such that it is minimal for the inclusion. == See also == * Timed automaton * Signal automaton * Clock temporal logic * Timed propositional temporal logic == Notes == Category:Automata (computation) Category:Model checking ","title":"Clock (model checking)"},{"id":"60280851","text":"Aleksej Pokuševski (; born December 26, 2001) is a Serbian professional basketball player for Olympiacos Piraeus of the EuroLeague, and formerly of the club's reserve team.

Alexandre Bandzeladze's family, after having been exiled to the Irkutsk District during the repressions in the 1920s, returned to Tbilisi in 1932. In 1947, he enrolled in the Oil Painting Department of the Tbilisi Academy of Fine Arts under the tutorship of Sergo Kobuladze, Iosif Charlemagne, and Valentin Sherpilov. Expelled from the academy in 1949, he received his diploma as late as 1963, with the help of Apolon Kutateladze. At that time, Bandzeladze actively collaborated with the editorial teams of various Georgian magazines. He authored milestone works for the development of Georgian book graphic design, such as Arsenas Leksi (Arsena's Poem) (1957) and Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli (1960). In 1978–1988, he painted the murals at the Church of the Dormition of the Mother of God in . In the 1950s, Alexandre Bandzeladze led an innovative movement in Georgia and the Soviet Union in general and pioneered the process of rejuvenating the language of visual arts. During his creative quest, and as a result of taking in the traditions of modernist European oil painting, he developed his own artistic system characterized by striking individualism. After Davit Kakabadze, Alexandre Bandzeladze was one of the first to have returned abstract art into Georgia's artistic context. Alexandre Bandzeladze's works have had an enormous impact on the development of contemporary Georgian visual arts and on nourishing interest in arts among younger generations. == Exhibitions == Solo exhibitions *1991 \\"Dissident “, Sevikli, Pennsylvania, USA *1991 Georgian Abstractions, Nicholas Rerikh Museum, New York - New York, USA *1990 \\"Where am I...?\\", Amsterdam, Netherlands *1989 Sevikli, Pennsylvania, USA *1988 Basel, Brussels, Belgium *1968 Opava, Czech Republic Group Exhibitions *2000 - N Gallery, Tbilisi, Georgia *1992 - Mapini Art - Gallery, Sheffield, England *1991 - \\"Georgian Abstraction\\", \\"international image\\" Gallery, Pittsburgh, USA *1990 - \\"In the expression of watercolor,\\" Tbilisi, Georgia *1990 - Four Design from Tbilisi, prideritsianis Museum, Kassel exhibition of abstract art.

He is the son of West Ham United owner, David Sullivan. ==Social media and journalism== Sullivan first came to public attention following his controversial use of Twitter to discuss West Ham United's club affairs and transfers. In 2013, commenting on the signing of Marouane Chamakh, Sullivan wrote \\"I am very sorry about this news Chamakh has sign a 6 month loan deal! not my pick :(\\". In 2015, Sullivan posted a picture of West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce laughing in a tweet mocking West Ham rivals, Millwall following their relegation to League One. Sullivan was criticised by Graeme Souness for his use of Twitter. Souness wrote in The Times that the use of Twitter to criticise the manager’s selections, substitutions and signings was unacceptable. Former West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce, blamed owner David Sullivan for giving the information to his son and for allowing him to tweet it. Sullivan also wrote a column called The Insider on West Ham's website. This discussed transfer targets and fees and was pulled from the club's official website on the orders of West Ham's managing director, Karren Brady after she had been inundated with complaints from supporters. Following this Sullivan was engaged by The Sun tabloid newspaper to write a twice monthly column. ==West Ham United Women== Sullivan was appointed as managing director of West Ham Women, by his father, in 2017. He had been involved with the women's team since leaving school aged 16. In Sullivan's first year, he led an application to advance the club from the part-time third division to the Women's Super League; it was West Ham's first appearance in the top competition. In 2018 he was the subject of a BBC Three programme, Britain's Youngest Football Boss, focusing on his running of the club and on the lives of female footballers. The programme was later shown on BBC One after Match of the Day, achieving viewing figures of 1.3 million. ==Personal life== Sullivan attended Chigwell School. He has dyslexia.

The total installed capacity of wind power on the island is about 171,700 kilowatts. Nan'ao island is rich in wind resources. with an average annual wind speed of 8.54 m/s. and an effective wind speed of more than 7,000 hours. ==Development== Since 1989, wind farms have been built and developed in Nan'ao County. Nine companies have participated in the project through wholly owned, financing, Sino-foreign joint ventures, or joint-stock cooperation. So far, the project has gone through 13 stages. Wind power development was initially brought to Nan’ao by the local government for electrification of the island. The continued involvement of the local government in Nan’ao's wind power industry has proved instrumental in the continued development of the island's wind resources. Selling about 75 percent of the power produced by the island's wind farms to the mainland has become a profitable industry that brings important revenue to the small island economy (U.S. Embassy Beijing, 1999). ==Details== There are 10 wind farms located on the central part of the Nan'ao island, with a total of 236 wind turbines. By 2020, it will be planned to add 25 wind farms (21 onshore and 4 offshore) with a total installed capacity of 621.4MW (211.4MW onshore and 410MW off shore). In the year 2016, Nanao Wind Power Project created a total wind power output of 36.29 million kWh and an output value of US$28,369,896. ==Tourism== In order to popularize the technology, research and development, application, value of wind power generation, and inspire people to protect and cherish the earth, resources and environment, the local government has built some science functional showrooms based on the wind farm nearby. There visitors can get wind power knowledge on wind turbine structure, power generation principle, development, status quo, significance and prospects of wind power by video, pictures and text. Otherwise, new energy projects of the 21st century, such as solar energy, wave energy, electric vehicle projects, various types of wind turbines, and related scientific knowledge, such as optoelectronics, aerodynamics, energy conversion, electromagnetic induction, electronic remote control, computer programming, power grid texture, etc., are presented to the visitors in the form of models, pictures, text, videos, slides, etc. ==See also== *List of power stations in China#Wind ==References== Category:Wind farms in China Category:Shantou ","title":"Nan'ao Wind Farm"},{"id":"60280954","text":"Nadejda \\"Nadia\\" Waloff FRES (2 September 1909 – 5 June 2001) was a Russian- born English entomologist.

Nadia was born in St. Petersburg and her family fled in 1919 and took refuge in Britain. Along with her sister Zena (died 1991) and two brothers she was taken care of by Boris Uvarov, who was the director of the Anti-Locust Research Centre in London. An early interest in entomology led her and Zena to study at the Imperial College. Nadia worked on pests at the Slough laboratory and received a Ph.D and Sc.D from Imperial College. She was known for her teaching ability and conducted research on the diapause of flour moths, the ecology and population dynamics of various insects. Some of her significant research included studies on the dispersal and flight of Hemiptera including leafhoppers. She examined the factors contributing to wing polymorphism, the presence of wingless, short-winged and long-winged forms in relation to habitats and life-history. She suggested that trees and woody plants are architecturally more complex with leaves being widely separated and making flight more important. This she suggested would explain the observation that cicadas and other arboreal hemiptera rarely had wingless forms. She was also among the first to use radioactive P-35 tracers to study the dispersal of mirid bugs. She retired in 1978. The grasshopper Oedaleus nadiae was named after her. ==References== Category:British entomologists Category:Women entomologists Category:Fellows of the Royal Entomological Society Category:20th-century British scientists Category:20th-century British women scientists Category:Russian emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:People from Saint Petersburg Category:People who emigrated to escape Bolshevism Category:Alumni of Imperial College London Category:Academics of Imperial College London Category:1909 births Category:2001 deaths Category:20th-century zoologists ","title":"Nadia Waloff"},{"id":"60280956","text":"The Emporium is a commercial building located at 154-156 West Michigan Avenue in Marshall, Michigan.

Lutes made by Laux Maler were highly prized by musicians in the seventeenth century. In April 1645 Constantijn Huygens tried to obtain a nine rib Laux Maler lute from Jacques Gaultier, a lutenist at the court of Charles I of England. Gaultier said there were only fifty extant, six in London, of medium size and not suitable to accompany a singer. Soon after Gaultier found one of the larger size, recently rebuilt in London by a Master Nichols. Huygens had the lute sent to him on approval, but did not buy it. In 1649 Charles I gave Gaultier another Laux Maler lute, formerly belonging to the royal lutenist John Ballard. Gaultier offered this lute to Huygens, and sent it to The Hague but could not secure an expert recommendation for it from their mutual friend Mary Woodhouse.Matthew Spring, 'A Goose Among Swans', The Lute in the Netherlands in the Seventeenth Century (Cambridge Scholars, Newcastle, 2016), pp. 131, 137-40: Lisa Jardine, Temptation in the Archives (UCL: London, 2015), pp. 61-3. ==References== Category:Lute makers Category:Luthiers Category:1485 births Category:1552 deaths Category:People from Füssen ","title":"Laux Maler"},{"id":"60281079","text":"Hans Frei or Hans Frey (1450–1523) was a renaissance luthier specialising in lutes, from Nuremberg, Germany.

Nissenkorn is a member of the 21st Knesset for the Israel Resilience Party, as part of the Blue and White list. ==Biography== Avraham (Avi) Nissenkorn was born in Afula to Israel and Ilana, physicians who immigrated from Poland. He was Israel's youth sprinting champion, and holds the underage Israeli record for 200 m. He participated in the 1986 World Junior Championships in Athletics – Men's 200 metres. In the Israel Defense Forces, he served as a sports instructor at Bahad 4. Nissenkorn studied at Tel Aviv University and earned a bachelor's degree in law. Nissenkorn met his wife Andrea while studying at Tel Aviv University. They have two children, Ori and Ron and live in Hod HaSharon. His younger son Ron suffers from severe epilepsy. ==Legal career== Nissenkorn started his career with an internship at Benjamin M. Cohen and Associates, a Tel Aviv law firm. Nissenkorn began at Histadrut in the late 1990s, as head of the collective agreement department. He continued as head of the legal department of Histadrut's professional unions. In this capacity, he participated in negotiations related to large- scale government reforms, such as the transition from budgetary to cumulative pensions, Bezeq's privatization and others. In 2001 he founded a private law firm specializing in labor laws, and returned to Histadrut in 2010 at Eini's request, to chair the professional unions—a position considered second only to the general secretary. He sold the private firm to Orna Lin & Co. In May 2014, following chairman Ofer Eini's resignation, Nissenkorn ran uncontested in an internal leadership election, where Histadrut's 171-member parliament would pick the new chairman, as a member of Eini's Oganim faction. The election itself was contested by Labor politician Eitan Cabel. Cabel claimed that the internal election was illegal and that in the case of a chairman's resignation, general Histadrut elections would have to be called. The case reached the Supreme Court, where it was struck down. As chairman, Nissenkorn helped seal a deal that would see contract workers working for government agencies move to direct employment, and agreements for general pay raises for government employees. However, he was criticized for not doing enough to curb the contract worker phenomenon in practice, as well as over-representing major labor unions at the expense of ordinary workers. ==Political career== In February 2016, Nissenkorn registered as a member of the Labor Party. In February 2019, in the lead-up to the April 2019 national elections, Nissenkorn joined the Israel Resilience Party led by Benny Gantz. He was placed fifth on the list, and was reportedly promised a ministership by Gantz should the faction succeed in forming a government.

The film was produced by Amoghavarsha J S and Kalyan Varma in collaboration with Icon Films and Mudskipper. The film was narrated by Sir David Attenborough with theme music composed by Grammy-winning composer and music-producer, Ricky Kej. The film was premiered on 3 March 2019 in front of an audience of 3000 at an open-air theatre at Palace Grounds in Bangalore, India. It was also shown at a special screening at the United Nations headquarters on the same day in 2020. == Background == Karnataka is India's 6th largest state and has a recorded forest area of 38720 km2 which constitutes 20.19% of the total geographical area of the state. Its ecosystem supports different kinds of forests, ranging from the wet evergreen forests of the Western Ghats, to deciduous forests of the Mysore district to thorn scrub forests and rocky outcrops of Ramnagar and Daroji, extending to the riverine and marine ecosystems, all found in this one state of Karnataka. These forests support 25% of the elephant population and 20% of the tiger population of India, making it home to the largest population of tigers and Asiatic elephants on the planet. This 52 minute film took 1500 days of production with 15000 hours on the field resulting in 2400 minutes of footage from 20 cameras and 50 sequences all shot with an intention to spread awareness, love and respect for the state's majestic and beautiful natural history and heritage. All of this was shot at locations within a 7-hour drive from the capital district of the state, Bengaluru. == Subject == Wild Karnataka displays the varied habitats and species across Karnataka. The film is story driven. Subjects include tigers and elephants, along with lesser-known species like the Lion-tailed Macaque, Hornbills, amphibians and reptiles. It was the first film in India to be narrated by Sir David Attenborough. == Production == The documentary took about 4 years to produce from more than 400 hours of footage. The film was shot using cutting edge technology and cameras with 4k broadcast quality, and was the first to show wildlife in India from an aerial perspective. Quiet air-borne cameras were used for this so as to create minimum disturbance to the wildlifet. This is the first wildlife film in which has an equal representation of women. As opposed to the traditional instances where women work in the production side of a film and as much on the field bringing in a different perspective. === Filmmakers and partners === The team behind the film include Prashanth S Nayaka, Praveen, Sugandhi Gadadhar, Raghunath Belur, Adarsh Raju, Pradeep Hegde, Pooja Rathod and Ashwini Kumar Bhat and was headed by award-winning wildlife photographers and film-makers Amoghavarsha J S and Kalyan Varma with the unwavering support of Chief Conservator of Forests at Karnataka's Forest Department, Mr. Vijay Mohan Raj and acclaimed naturalist Sarath Champati. Even though the theme of the documentary is forest and wilderness, the Forest Department has not made any funding and much of the film's financing has come from eco-tourism resorts and mining companies. The partners include Sandur Iron ore and Manganese Limited, Discovery Village and Jungle Lodges & Resorts. ==Soundtrack== ===Original soundtrack=== == Recognition == * Released in PVR screens within India on 17 January 2020, Wild Karnataka was the first Indian wildlife film to be released in theatres.

On account of the temple, the hillock on which the temple is located is known as Temblai hill. The temple complex has two temples, the bigger temple on the southern end is Temblai devi while the one on the north eastern side is a smaller one dedicated to Yamai devi. The location is flanked on the northern side by a road and the southern side by the territorial army quarters. Devotees, especially women visit the temple and pray to marry a man of their choice or if married, wish and pray for the long and healthy life of their husband. It is also a well known local tourist spot for visitors and locals. The Temblai temple complex has been recognized as one of the many places to visit for tourists coming to the city. There exists another temple of Temblai devi near the Panchganga river at Kadamwadi a short distance away from this grand temple. The temple complex has a large idol of Ganpati in the open plateau section on the north eastern side of the temple. Next to the Ganpati idol is a small commemorative bust statue of Shivaji built by the Devasthan committee. The local authorities have developed this area with a small children's park. In the pre-independence era, the hillock was a centre for treating tuberculosis patients on account of fresh air winds blowing in over the hill.. Another relatively lesser known temple of Goddess Temblai is located in the city on the banks of Panchaganga river at Kadamwadi on the north eastern side of the city. == Legend == Ganesha statue at the Temblai hill temple complex Local legends say that Goddess Renuka is the sister of Mahalaxmi and she actively supported Mahalaxmi in her endeavours to slay the demons in the region. However after the wars Mahalaxmi did not accord her due respect to Goddess Renuka and she came down to the hill and sat there with her back towards Mahalaxmi. This is the reason why the idol of Mahalaxmi at her temple faces the west and that of the Goddess Renuka at Temblai faces the east. Every year during Navratri there is a procession that celebrates the reconciliation of the two sisters on the fifth day of Lalitpanchami. == Culture and celebration == A bust statue of the founder of the Maratha empire, Shivaji inside the temple complex In the month of Shravan, pilgrims flock to the temple for the annual pilgrimage known as Temblai yatra (jatra) where people from far off areas of Kolhapur and Belgaum district arrive to worship the Goddess. Every year during Navratri, on the fifth day of Lalitapanchami, a palkhi procession is taken from the Mahalaxmi temple to Temblai mandir at Temblai hill. As of 2013, over 1 million devotees visited the temple during Navratri festival. Local dialects use a common salutation to the Goddess Tembali chya navane chang bhala, this has extensively been used in sholkas and bhajans that devotees sing and play during the annual pilgrimage and other times at their homes.Song dedicated to Goddess Temblai During the festival special arrangements are made by the administration to manage traffic and diversions for the convenience of the devotees. The royal family of Shahu II had special regard for the Temblai fair as people had a special importance for his presence during the event. Another legend from the Karvir Puran states that Temblai, the younger sister of Mahalaxmi, left the city of Kolhapur 1800 years ago and came over to the hillock three miles from the city and remained there with her back to her elder sister at Mahalaxmi temple. Every year in the month of Ashvin, on the fifth day of the bright moon, the elder sister Mahalaxmi visits her younger sister at Temblai. The festival is now celebrated as traditional event where a procession is carried out with Mahalaxmi placed in a palkhi and followed by a young unmarried girl cutting a pumpkin to commemorate the killing of the demon Kolhasur by Mahalaxmi Ambabai. Temblai hill hosts a fair in the temple complex that has 15000-20000 pilgrims. There are offerings and distribution of sweets to the Goddess. The fair has food and toy stalls along with fun rides attractions for children. The royal family of the Maratha empire had also been actively participating in the temple celebrations. On one instance, the queens of the royal family of Kolhapur had invited Shahu II to perform a ceremony at the Temblai festival after his marriage. In 2009, the Temblai temple at Panchganga ghat was also the venue for the Kolhapur municipal corporation event of Rankala mahotsav. == Temblai locality and the army == The Temblai area is a formation of three hillocks, one of which has the Renuka devi temple complex. The second one has a water tank built over it. The third one on the opposite side of the road was donated by the royal family of Chhatrapati of Kolhapur in the 1950s for utilization by the Indian army territorial army contingent. Prior to this the hillock was the headquarter and barrack of the royal army called Rajaram rifles (that later merged with Maratha regiment in 1951) that was under Chattrapati's command during colonial times. In December 2018, an event exhibition was organized for citizens by the territorial army to commemorate the armed forces flag day. This exhibition had a display of various arms and ammunition including machine guns, rocket launchers and grenade launchers. There was a small function too to felicitate family members of martyrs. == References == https://abpmajha.abplive.in/videos/kolhapur-kohala-panchami-sohala-tryamboli- devi-utsav-live-1pm-595506 *https://maharashtratimes.indiatimes.com/kolhapur- western-maharashtra-news/kolhapur/changing-kolhapur-temblai- wadi/articleshow/53049738.cms Category:Hindu goddesses Category:Kolhapur Category:Temples Category:Devi temples in India Category:Deities by religion ","title":"Temblai"},{"id":"60281454","text":"Novourusovka () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Buzansky Selsoviet, Krasnoyarsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

He later lived in California, USA and finished his secondary education at Beverly Hills High School. He went to the University of California Los Angeles to earn his bachelor degree in Aerospace, Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering and his master degree in Mechanical Engineering. In June 2017, Yenbamroong founded mu Space, a company based in Bangkok that offers satellite services, smart city solutions, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, of which he is CEO and lead design architect. In addition to his primary business pursuit, Yenbamroong has future plans of providing space tourism service to people in Asia-Pacific and sending the first 100 humans to the moon. He has stated that the goals of mu Space revolve around his vision of improving the quality of life of people on Earth. His goals include mitigating the impact of human overpopulation on the environment and reducing the risk of human extinction by setting up a lunar habitation. == Early life == Born on June 13, 1984 in Bangkok, Yenbamroong was the youngest among three siblings. He is the son of Vilas Yenbamroong, a Thai military general, and Lamaiporn Yenbamroong, a senior US embassy staff in Thailand. He is a cousin of award-winning chef Kris Yenbamroong, named Food & Wine Magazine's Best New Chef in 2016 and author of the Night + Market cookbook. Yenbamroong's interest in aviation started when, as a child, he drew airplanes and robots on the wall of his bedroom. His father, who often brought him to airshows and military museums, had also influenced his fascination with flights and the outer space. Yenbamroong had read the biographies of Internet entrepreneur Sergey Brin and business magnate Warren Buffett, from which he learned about investing and how to start a company. He was exposed to business at a young age, starting off by selling used books and video games to his childhood friends for profit. == Education == Yenbamroong received his early education in Bangkok at Sarawittaya School. At 14, he went to New Zealand for his secondary education at Cambridge High School, where he was a varsity player in tennis. At school, he showed a strong interest in astronomy, physics and kinematics. Yenbamroong later moved to the US and continued his secondary education at Beverly Hills High School. While studying, he played for the school's soccer team. His time in the US, which coincided with the boom of private space ventures, had influenced Yenbamroong's decision to pursue a university degree in Aerospace, Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering. He obtained his bachelor degree in 2008 from the University of California Los Angeles and his master degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2010 from the same university. == Career == === Early career === During his initial years in the US, Yenbamroong worked as part-time staff at Talesai, a Thai restaurant in Los Angeles. He was later a physics lab assistant at Santa Monica College and an intern at the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. While studying at the University of California Los Angeles, Yenbamroong worked as a system engineer for satellite projects at Northrop Grumman, an aerospace and defense technology company. He was later promoted as project lead for unmanned vehicle systems at Northrop. Yenbamroong left the US and moved back to Bangkok in 2014. === Space and satellite company === In June 2017, Yenbamroong founded mu Space and Advanced Technology, or mu Space, using his personal money. The company researches and develops satellite and smart city services for urban and rural areas. mu Space initially had 6 staff and later increased to 30 after the company raised US$3 million in funds. In December 2017, Thailand's National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission granted mu Space a 15-year license until 2032 to provide satellite services in the country. The company is temporarily using the satellites of another company SES to provide broadband services, pending the launch of the company's own satellite in 2021. Worth up to US$150 million, the satellite will use the 50.5-degrees East orbital slot to provide coverage over Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand. Initially focused on the implementation of a satellite-powered broadband project in Thailand, the company under Yenbamroong, later on, started doing space-related activities. In July 2018, mu Space became the first Asian company to send a payload aboard the New Shepard rocket of Blue Origin to test the effects of microgravity on properties of materials. The payload included a silicon bleeding-prevention device used in hospitals, a carbon nanotube and a vacuum- sealed food product. In April 2019, Yenbamroong revealed that mu Space has submitted a proposal to NASA to build a lunar landing system. === Venture capital === Yenbamroong is opening in 2019 a venture capital unit to provide funds to startups and medium-sized companies working on artificial intelligence, robotics, space research and deep space exploration. The venture unit, with an initial fund of US$100 million, will be set up in Singapore. === Tham Luang cave rescue === Yenbamroong sent several engineers of mu Space to help in the rescue mission to save the 12 boys and their football coach trapped inside Tham Luang cave in 2018. His company mu Space also collaborated with Google and Weather Decision Technologies to provide rescuers with weather forecast models in the cave area. Elon Musk, the founder of The Boring Company, a US-based tunnel construction company, also discussed with Yenbamroong his plan to help in the rescue. Over Twitter, Musk initially suggested using a ground penetrating radar to dig holes to reach the boys, and then to install a giant air tube that the boys can use as a temporary passageway. Later on, Musk settled on the idea of using kid-sized submarines for the rescue mission, which he had personally flown to Thailand on his private jet. However, Thai authorities did not use the kid-sized submarines, and decided to send divers to extract the trapped boys and their football coach out of the cave. == Recognitions == * Received the Quality Persons of the Year 2018 award from the Foundation of Science and Technology Council of Thailand * Listed in GQ Magazine in 2018 as \\"19 Thais We Are Proud Of\\" == References == == External links == *James Yenbamroong's blog Category:Living people Category:Beverly Hills High School alumni Category:People from Bangkok Category:Thai engineers Category:1984 births Category:People in the space industry Category:University of California, Los Angeles alumni Category:Thai chief executives Category:People educated at Cambridge High School, New Zealand ","title":"James Yenbamroong"},{"id":"60281481","text":"Pervomaysky () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Krasnoyarsky Selsoviet, Krasnoyarsky District, Astrakhan Oblast, Russia.

Jason’s favorite songs as a child were \\"I Wanna Know\\" by Joe, \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\" by Tupac, and \\"If I Ain’t Got You\\" by Alicia Keys. He grew up on the music that the older generation enjoyed, and this influenced his soulful, melodic sound. Surely, the Chris Brown and Mariah Carey concerts he attended as a child shaped his perspective on musical artists as well. Jason began writing poetry and songs as early as eighth grade, when he noticed the apparent link between written poetry and musical rhythm. In his freshman year of high school, Roberts tried his hand at music production as part of a Technology class centered on Apple products. Naturally, he learned his technique on Garageband, and produced his first instrumental for the class final. His production was compared to that of Kid Cudi, who he played heavily during his high school days, along with Alternative Rock bands like My Chemical Romance, Green Day, Kings of Leon and many others. Roberts started performing live in venues across the Chicagoland area with the Soul Children of Chicago. This acclimated him to the concepts of live performance and touring, with long hours of practice, sound checks, and extensive travel time. At the University of Pennsylvania, Jason continued to advance his music career, adding a cappella to his growing repertoire. He joined The Inspiration A Cappella Group as a tenor, and had solos on songs like Butterflies by Michael Jackson and Can You Stand the Rain by Boyz II Men. Roberts then left The Inspiration to join The Collctve and explore the more collaborative side of music with “a diverse network of creatives, risk-takers, innovators, and collaborators coast to coast.” (2) Jason recorded two songs with them, titled “Freshman Cypher” and “Don’t Mind.” ===2018: Career beginnings and Higher=== During a self- exploratory gap year from UPenn, Roberts underwent formal musical training for the first time in his life, with Rev. Dr. Lena McLin, the woman responsible for the musical education of Whitney Houston, Jennifer Hudson, and R. Kelly.https://respect-mag.com/2019/12/buddaflywolf-talks-working-with-ye-ali- how-he-got-into-producing-and-more/ After graduating from UPenn, Roberts returned home to Chicago to being writing drafts for his first EP, CØMPLIMENTS. In April of 2018, Jason began the process of incorporating himself as Jason Ivy LLC, with the help of the legal team at DiSchino & Schamy, PLLC in Miami, Florida. This process was finalized in May of 2018, and Jason officially began his career in the music industry, surrounded by the familiar scenery and local artists of his hometown. Roberts recorded, mixed, and mastered his first single, “Higher,” exclusively at Classick Studios with the help of engineers Bryan Schwaller and Elton L10 Chueng. “Higher” received over 100,000 streams on Spotify and Soundcloud combined in under one week of its initial release, as well as praise from musical talent around the world.https://respect-mag.com/2019/12/buddaflywolf-talks-working-with-ye-ali- how-he-got-into-producing-and-more/ ===2019 — Present: CØMPLIMENTS EP=== CØMPLIMENTS, read: Empty Compliments, is the first EP project from Jason Ivy. While it encompasses a wide array of sounds, its genres can best be described as Neo Soul, R&B;, and Lo-fi Hip Hop.https://jlsc.com/winners/2019b/finalists.php The cover art for the album is as stimulating, visually, as the music. “Each icon represents one of the six songs from the project. In order, they are: Hate (the spiteful message and angered posture of the astronaut), Foreign (the astronaut itself), Higher (the rocket), Chlorophyll (the sunflowers), Ivythemoon. (the ivy leaves), and Pyre (the woman with the burning heart).” Jason Ivy explains that the “concept behind both the EP and the cover art is that these are all separate concepts that function as a whole, all mostly contained within this jar. Each of the songs addresses the state of the jar — being emotionally empty or filled — which doubles as a graphic metaphor for the state of the narrator’s own emotions.” It is apparent Jason uses his extensive education to clearly convey meaning through the mediums of art and music. ==Artistry== ===Musical style=== Roberts’ music has been described as smooth and uplifting, taking listeners “Higher.” His music generally consists of RnB-fueled melodies and harmonies, and Gospel-influenced runs and melismas. Roberts’ lyrics are extremely illustrative, often walking listeners through a complete train of thought with multiple double and triple entendres along the way. His musical style and instrumentation makes for chill, easy listening, but his lyrics provoke through and reflection, often addressing real life problems rather than reciting the music industry standard of “money, women, cars, clothes, and jewelry.” Jeff Mitchell at Odd Nugget has described Roberts’ lyrics as “sonic fire with a chill flame.” Though he may rap from time to time, the majority of Roberts’ music consists of traditional singing songs. Jason possesses a lyric- dramatic tenor voice with an expansive vocal range that covers 4 octaves. Roberts’ vocal range reaches its extreme low nearing vocal fry at the bass low B (B1), and rises to its high at the soprano C (C6) in falsetto. ===Fashion=== Roberts’ fashion style is a significant part of his public image, and he has taken interest in the industry for many years. He is part owner of the “No Homo Company” a fashion line dedicated to the reclamation of the deleterious homophobic phrase “no homo” for the LGBTQ+ community. This company illustrates Roberts’ ally-ship for the aforementioned community.https://www.wciu.com/videos/thejam/neo-soul-artist-jason-ivy In addition to the No Homo Company, Roberts has designed apparel for college student groups, as well as all of his own artist merchandise.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1762413337/thats-gay-rainbow- t-shirts-the-no-homo-company/posts ===Personal life=== Roberts lives on the Southside of his hometown, Chicago, Illinois. He leads a relatively normal life outside of music.https://www.wciu.com/videos/thejam/neo-soul-artist- jason-ivy ===Family=== His younger brother, Brayden Roberts, is also working on gaining a footing in the music world, by writing and producing music as a hobby. Brayden is credited on the first song of CØMPLIMENTS, “Hate,” as a songwriter. His younger brother, Brayden, is currently an undergraduate student at the University of Minnesota — Twin Cities.https://www.indiemusicreporter.com/post/the-2020-w-a-m-awards-announce- official-nominationshttp://wam-awards.com/2020-wam-award-album-nominees ===Spirituality=== After being confirmed as a Lutheran in eighth grade, Roberts refers to himself as a Christian. Roberts was raised as a Christian by his parents, and later went on his own spiritual journey, studying various religions and their origins throughout his free time in high school. He later settled on Taoism and Zen Buddhism as models for how to live his life due to their introspective natures, in addition to Christianity.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eSi7V2VEOw&list;=PLpnpcZweXcpZGzOimh23gWj9lwGyUiH4B&index;=14 Roberts often credits “the Universe” for his success and career opportunities, as a more open way to convey to others his belief in a higher being. ===Activism and politics=== Roberts is a Democrat, and both of his godfathers, Congressman Bobby Rush and Senator William Marovitz, are Democratically oriented politicians.https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/5/19/18629694/chicago- neighborhood-high-schools-memo-mayor-lightfoot-on-the-table Roberts served as an election judge during high school, and was a lively participant in voter activism. Throughout his career, Roberts has completed over 600 hours of community service, through his affiliation with the National Honor Society and his fraternity organization, Alpha Phi Omega.https://www.crresearch.com/webinar/amplifying-the-voice-of-the-african- american-consumer ==Discography== ;EP *CØMPLIMENTS (2019) ::- 2020 W.A.M.

Van Patten Co. Mill was a grist mill located at 109 Byron Street in Homer, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. It was destroyed by fire on May 17, 2010. ==History== The first mill in Homer was constructed about 1837 by Leon Barney and was likely located near the location of the later Cortright- H. Van Patten Co. Mill. In the 1850s, Cornelius Cuykendall Cortright moved from New York state to Michigan, settling first in Hillsdale County, then Branch County before moving to a location near Homer. In 1886, the original mill burned down. Cortright and his son David formed the firm of C. C. Cortright and Son, and in 1887 had the main section of this flour mill constructed. The Cortrights hired George A. McCartney of Homer as the contractor. A substantial addition was made to the original mill in about 1910. Cortright's son, David W. Cortright, also owned a farm in the area and operated the mill in Homer. In 1940, the H. Van Patten Company of Allen, Michigan, purchased the mill from the Cortright family and operated it as a mill until 1970. Leon A. Van Patten, son of Harlow Van Patten, operated the mill until its sale. In 1974, the mill was sold to James L. Miller, who converted it into a dinner theater known as \\"True Grist Ltd.\\" The dinner theater operated under various owners until 1987. In 1996, John and Alice Blakemore purchased the mill and opened a restaurant and banquet hall. in 2006, Lance and Susan Cuffle opened the Homer Mill as a restaurant, bar, and haunted house. The mill was destroyed by fire on May 17, 2010. ==Description== The Cortright- H. Van Patten Co. Mill was a rambling frame structure, mixing two-, three-, and four-story sections. The structure was clad in novelty siding. The original 1887 mill had bracketed eaves and dormer-pierced mansard roofs. Later portions, added in about 1910, were gable- and shed-roof sections. The mill manufactured Victor Flour until the H. Van Patten Co. converted it to grain storage and custom feed mill for local farmers. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calhoun County, Michigan Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1887 ","title":"Cortright-Van Patten Mill"},{"id":"60281670","text":"Efrat Mishori (in Hebrew: אפרת מישורי; born May 5, 1964) is an Israeli poet, essayist, performance artist, and filmmaker.

At the same time, they are operatively subordinated to the command of military districts. In this regard, the commander of the Airborne Forces in order to plan the transfer of units, you must go through a lot of approvals at the level of higher headquarters. Therefore, precious time is lost. In addition, a large number of participants in such negotiations may lead to information leaks. This negates the key factor of the Airborne Forces - surprise. Another reason: in the conditions of powerful air defense, the most effective is the transfer of troops by helicopter, which is almost imperceptible at ultra-low altitudes. In addition, a helicopter for paratroopers is not only a means of delivery, but also fire support. That is why it was decided to form its own aircraft in the Airborne Forces - airborne units will be able to use their helicopters without unnecessary delay. == Formation == The Ministry of Defense of Russia noted that the proposal to form one air force brigade in the Airborne Forces as a whole was approved. A new brigade is planned to be formed in the next 2-3 years. For the brigade it is necessary to order new helicopters.

Born in Dublin, Harris became a cabinet maker, and moved to Belfast to find work. He joined the Amalgamated Union of Upholsterers, and became prominent in the local trade union movement. In 1907, Robert Morley from the British-based Workers' Union came to speak in the city, and while he was present, a major strike occurred. This enabled him to recruit two local branches of factory workers, and Harris was appointed as the union's full-time Irish Organiser. Initially, he proved successful, recruiting heavily among chemical workers and builders' labourers', giving a total membership of more than 500. Although many of these workers soon left, Harris began recruiting among linen workers in Lisburn, and worked with James Larkin to establish branches of the union in Derry, Dundalk, Lisburn and Limerick. In 1908, he tried to establish a branch in Dublin, but due to disputes with other unions, he offered to transfer the branches to the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. Larkin declined the offer and, annoyed by this, Harris became an opponent of Larkin. He worked with James Sexton to get Larkin removed from the Parliamentary Committee of the Irish Trades Union Congress. The union's branches across Ireland did not prove lasting, and by 1911 Harris was described as the union's organiser for the Belfast District. During the early 1910s, the Workers' Union grew substantially in Britain, but Harris struggled to match this. Several local strikes ended in defeat, with many members leaving, though Harris claimed that his difficulties resulted from employers exploiting religious differences among workers. Early in 1913, he was transferred to South West England, to become assistant organiser to Matt Giles. Membership in the region was increasing rapidly, and by the end of the year, Devon and Cornwall was split off as a new region, with Harris as its organiser. He served on the Cornwall Agricultural Wages Committee, and soon chaired the Joint Industrial Committee for the china clay industry. The union sponsored Harris as a candidate in Penryn and Falmouth at the 1922 United Kingdom general election, and then in Plymouth Devonport at the 1923 United Kingdom general election, taking third place on each occasion.Labour Party, Report of the Twenty-second Annual Conference of the Labour Party, pp.255-272 ==References== Category:1866 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Irish trade unionists Category:Labour Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:People from Dublin (city) ","title":"Joseph Harris (trade unionist)"},{"id":"60281954","text":"Joaquín Martínez de la Vega Cisneros, usually cited as Joaquín Martínez de la Vega (Spanish: [xoa'kin mar'tineθ de la 'βega]; 23 June 1846 - 4 December 1905), was a Spanish painter and illustrator. Although he was born in Almería and studied at the Royal San Fernando Academy in Madrid, he is considered a member of the Málaga School of Painting. A dandyish, dissolute and often transgressive individual, Martínez de la Vega clashed, both personally and artistically, with traditionalist Bernardo Ferrándiz, founder of the Málaga School; on the other hand, he sympathized with young Picasso and was a lifelong friend of José Denis. His work, especially in the late part of his career, is considered the closest to modernity within the aforementioned painting school, approaching cultural fin-de-siècle European tendencies like symbolism, post-impressionism and even, according to some authors, pre- raphaelism. Notable works include his pastel series on The Temptations of St. Anthony, his religious paintings (Ecce Homo and Dolorosa) and the posters he designed for the Feria de Agosto, especially the one he painted for the 1895 edition. == Early life and education == Joaquín was born in Almería to parents Fernando Martínez de la Vega, a civil servant, and Carlota Cisneros Bonifaz, a housewife, both originally from Málaga. The family later relocated to Córdoba, where at age 15 Joaquín started art studies at the city Institute. He impressed his masters so much that just the following year he received a commission from the Provincial Government to illustrate an album to be presented to Queen Isabel II; as a reward, he received a 1000 pesetas per year scholarship to study art in Madrid. He moved to Madrid in 1863, where he enrolled in the Royal San Fernando Academy, the leading art school in Spain at the time. There he studied for three years under Federico de Madrazo, acquiring from him an admiration for Velázquez, a pure style for drawing and a restrained palette. In those years he kept sending works to Córdoba (as established by the terms of his scholarship), most of them copies of Velazquez's paintings. In 1866 he was granted a 3000 pesetas scholarship by the Córdoba Provincial Government to study painting in Rome; however, according to most of his biographers, he never travelled there and the scholarship was cancelled, apparently due to the death of his father. == Career and personal life == In 1869, Martínez de la Vega relocated to Málaga, where he rapidly befriended the painter José Denis and joined the local artistic circles; his recognition was boosted by the medal he obtained at the 1871 National Exhibition in Madrid, with the work A Beggar. In 1875 he started teaching drawing and color at the Málaga Lyceum, having among his pupils future painters such as Reyna Manescau and Xavier Cappa. Ecce Homo (1893), Málaga Museum. During the late 1870s and early 1880s he rose to local fame and became a popular portrait painter and private drawing teacher for the provincial aristocracy, at a time when Málaga was a prosperous industrial center; however, unlike other painters like Moreno Carbonero, the dandyish and flamboyant Martínez de la Vega did not seek international or even national fame and he would not again send his works to any national exhibitions, which some biographers connect to a dissolute and disordered lifestyle and others to the bad reviews received by a painting he sent to the 1871 exhibition. In 1882, despite his public disagreements and conflicts with Bernardo Ferrándiz, he was appointed as an assistant teacher at the Málaga School of Fine Arts. On 30 April 1885 he married María Dolores Casilari Bailón, with whom he had a daughter the following year; in this period he focussed on his career and produced, among other works, Vamos o No Vamos for the Málaga Lyceum. However, the infant died before her first birthday, which made the artist plunge into a severe depression aggravated by alcohol and cocaine abuse. The couple decided to move out of Málaga, but Joaquín's application for a teaching position in Seville was rejected in 1892. In early 1893, his wife María Dolores died too. Martínez de la Vega would never recover from the loss of his family; however, the personal and financial collapse stirred him artistically to find new themes and styles. After the death of his wife he devoted to religious paintings, producing among others a series of Ecce Homo and paintings of the Virgin Mary (Dolorosas) that count as some of his master pieces. In 1894 and 1895 he was commissioned by the town council to create the posters for the Feria de Agosto festivals; the 1895 poster, titled Carmen, la más fea de mi tierra (Carmen, the Ugliest in my Hometown), is one of his most cited works. In 1897 he met Pablo Picasso, then sixteen, and immediately recognized his talent; Martínez de la Vega organized a tribute for the young artist at the Málaga Lyceum, where he and José Nogales mock-baptyzed Picasso with champagne as a newborn master. The Temptations of Saint Anthony (c. 1900), private collection. His addictions and scandals made him gradually infamous among the city's society, and he gradually lost his private lessons and most sources of income. On 19 September 1900 he married, against the will of her family, Pepita Cestino Utrera, the young heiress of a rich local family, only to have her running away back to her family's home on their wedding night; she died at the age of 78, without ever marrying again. With the meager salary as an assistant teacher at the School of Fine Arts as his almost only earnings, he lost his house and had to move to a small accommodation provided by José Denis. His late paintings became highly symbolic and sketchy; he was said to pay his bills at local taverns with doodles and sketches drawn on napkins or rough wrapping paper. Destitute and marginalized, Martínez de la Vega was found dead in his room on 4 December 1905, at the age of 59, victim of an intracerebral hemorrhage. == Style and technique == Within the Málaga School of Painting, Martínez de la Vega represented \\"vanguardism without rupture\\", and he was the most closely connected to the new European artistic tendencies of the time. Since he did not travel much, biographers speculate that he was influenced by the new movements through illustrated art magazines and contact with more internationally connected colleagues. Throughout his career he rejected landscape painting (which was popular at the time) and narrative conventionalism. Sauret and Chaves distinguish three different artistic periods in his career: \\\\- From 1863 to 1877, under the academical influence of Federico de Madrazo, he developed a romantic style, with a carefully drawn trace and classical composition. He preferred romantic themes to historical ones, and his portraits were influenced by Madrazo and Velázquez. Portrait of D. Joaquín Inglada Torregrosa (1900), private collection. \\\\- From 1877 to 1888 Martínez de la Vega was influenced by other members of the Málaga School, particularly Denis and Ferrándiz. He produced orientalist paintings reminiscent or Fortuny, whom his colleagues in Málaga greatly admired, and also religious paintings. He continued creating abundant portraits, with similar techniques. \\\\- From 1888 to 1905 he suffered a profound personal crisis that heavily transformed his style and technique; this is the most interesting period of his production. He gradually introduced new techniques and themes; in the first part of this period, specially after his wife's death, he spiritualized the characters in his religious paintings and, according to some authors, approached pre-raphaelism. This religious paintings gradually evolved into symbolism and post-impressionism, adopting pastel as his main art medium and abandoning his carefully drawn lines to develop a sketchy technique that is reminiscent of contemporary post-impressionist painters like Toulouse-Lautrec and Ramón Casas. His themes in this final stage included religious introspection and erotism, as reflected in his series on The Temptations of St. Anthony. In his late portraits, like the Portrait of D. Joaquín Inglada Torregrosa, he abandoned classical composition and sets the models in daily and intimate environments. == Gallery (in chronological order) == File:Gaitero napolitano - Joaquín Martínez de la Vega.jpgNeapolitan Piper (c. 1865), Córdoba Museum of Fine Arts.

Previously she also served as MP of the Congress for the constituency of Madrid in 9th and 10th Legislature of the Cortes Generales. She is the current Director of International Relations of FAES. Since her return to journalism she writes for the daily newspaper El Mundo. ==Biography== Cayetana Álvarez de Toledo y Peralta-Ramos was born in Madrid to a French father and an Argentine mother. She is a national of Argentina, France and Spain. She is the daughter of Juan Illán Álvarez de Toledo y Giraud, the 12th Marquess of Casa Fuerte, who fought as part of the French Resistance during the Second World War, and of Patricia Peralta-Ramos y Madero. Having spent most of her early life in the United Kingdom and Argentina, Cayetana Álvarez de Toledo has stated on various occasions that she «decided to be Spanish». After spending the first seven years of her childhood in London, she moved to Buenos Aires, enrolling in the exclusive and prestigious «Northlands School». She returned to the United Kingdom to obtain her university degrees. There, she obtained a post-graduate degree in Modern History at the University of Oxford, being a member of the New College and she also obtained a PhD on that matter with her dissertation about the Bishop Juan de Palafox, Viceroy of New Spain, directed by the Hispanicist historian John H. Elliott. She married Spanish businessman (and her distant cousin) Joaquín Güell (from the family of the Marquesses of Comillas and Counts of Güell) in 20 October 2001. They had two daughters but they divorced in January 2018. After obtaining her PhD, she became an editor in the daily newspaper El Mundo in September 2000, first in the Opinion section and later in the Economy section. She was also a talk show guest on the Cadena COPE programme «The Morning», hosted by Federico Jiménez Losantos. ===Political career=== In 2006 she was appointed Chief of Staff of the leader of the People's Party (PP), Ángel Acebes, with the task of advising Acebes regarding political strategy, managing his agenda and coordinating the elaboration of his speeches in parliament. She continued her job as journalist in El Mundo and she was elected the «young global leader» in 2008 by the World Economic Forum to recognise «her professional achievements, commitment to society and her potential to contribute to the forging of the future of the world». Álvarez de Toledo, who obtained Spanish nationality in 2007, stood for the 2008 general election as a member of the People's Party list for the constituency of Madrid, as number 9 on the list, becoming a Member of Parliament in the 9th Cortes Generales, where she served as a Deputy Spokesperson of the People's Party Parliamentary Group. In 2011 she stood again in the general election, being re-elected MP to the 10th Legislature. She was the Vice President of the Joint Committee for the European Union and a member of the Justice and Constitutional Committees in the Congress of Deputies. She was also responsible for the Analysis Department of the People's Party of the Community of Madrid. As a result of her father's death in Paris in 2012, she inherited the title of Marchioness of Casa Fuerte a year later. Boletín Oficial del Estado (BOE) - 12 October 2013 She is the 13th holder of the title. In 2014 she wrote an article in the Financial Times against the separatist direction in which Catalan nationalism was perceived to be heading. In 2014 she launched the constitutionalist manifesto Free and Equal as one of her first signature reforms. The manifesto rejected all concessions to the Catalan nationalists who desired independence. She was the spokesperson of the homonymous organisation which seeks to involve the Spanish citizenry in the defense of the constitutional provisions of equality between all Spaniards against Catalan nationalism which is perceived as a threat to «the equality of all Spaniards», citing the attempt to establish the «Catalan people» as sovereign. Among the events organised by Free and Equal is the one which took place on 11 September 2014, the triennial of the defeat of the pro-Habsburg forces in Barcelona during the War of the Spanish Succession, in the Círculo de Bellas Artes of Madrid, where she also gave a speech. On 14 October 2015, she announced, through the newspaper El Mundo, that she would not stand for re- election as a candidate for the People's Party due to disagreements with the Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, regarding economic matters, Catalan separatism and the erosion of public institutions. She gained particular popularity in 2016, after criticising the Cabalgata de Reyes organised by the City Council of Madrid, through a Tweet with the following text: «My 6-year old daughter: 'Mom, this Gaspar's costume isn't real' I will never forgive you for this, Manuela Carmena. Never». The Tweet received more than six thousand replies and twelve thousand retweets, going viral. On 8 March 2018, she criticised the feminist strike taking place on that same day through a newspaper. In June 2018 she published an opinion article after the dissolution of Mariano Rajoy government resulting from the no confidence motion sponsored by the PSOE. Álvarez de Toledo confirmed that she continue being a People's Party member, having however voted for the liberal centre-right party Ciudadanos, and she asked for the merging of the two parties. On 15 March 15, 2019 it was announced that she would run 1st in the PP list for the Congress of Deputies in the Barcelona constituency for the 28 April 2019 general election. As result of the election she became a member of the lower house, effectively assuming office on 21 May 2019. In July, the party's leader, Pablo Casado, announced that she would be the party's spokesperson for the 13th Congress of Deputies. She continued in the position in the 14th Congress of Deputies until 21 August 2020. == Committee assignments == === 9th Congress of Deputies === * Constitutional Committee * Committee on Home Affairs * Joint Committee on Parliamentary Control of the RTVE Corporation and its companies === 13th Congress of Deputies === * Constitutional Committee * Committee on Justice ==References== Category:1974 births Category:20th-century Spanish historians Category:21st-century women Category:Living people Category:Marquesses of Spain Category:Members of the 9th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 10th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 13th Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Argentine nobility Category:Spanish journalists Category:Spanish people of Argentine descent Category:Spanish people of French descent Category:Spanish women journalists Category:Women members of the Congress of Deputies (Spain) Category:Members of the 14th Congress of Deputies (Spain) ","title":"Cayetana Álvarez de Toledo"},{"id":"60282051","text":"Uroballus kinabalu is a species of spider of the genus Uroballus.

From 1895 he was apprenticed as an engineer at Bow, McLachlan and Company at the Thistle Works at Abbotsinch.Paisley Post Office Directory 1895 He also undertook formal training at Anderson College in Glasgow. He then joined the British and Burmese Steam Navigation Company as Chief Engineer. In 1910 he joined Brown Brothers in Leith as an engineer. He originally lived in a small flat at 116 Easter Road.Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1911 He rose rapidly becoming Managing Director in 1916 aged 35. He remained Managing Director until 1957 also becoming Chairman in 1947. Considering that Brown Brothers was primarily involved in the design and creation of ship components it is unusual that their premises was not located at a dock or major river. Their huge complex stood linking Pilrig Street to Broughton Road, wrapping around Rosebank Cemetery. This is around a mile from Leith Docks. This \\"inconvenience\\" was probably the result of a ground-rent dispute, but gave them a later advantage in giving a very \\"secure\\" site in terms of new creations for warfare, commissioned by the government. During the First World War he was involved with the design and building of the infamously ill-fated British K-class submarines. Due to this position as designer he was on board K 13 during its trials when she failed to surface during trials at the Gareloch on 29 January 1917. Thirty two people died in this incident, and 48 were rescued. Wallace's technical knowledge undoubtedly aided the survival of those rescued. In the 1930s (with Maurice Denny) he developed the Denny-Brown stabilizer, first used on a cross-Channel ferry in 1936 and a popular choice in many Royal Navy ships during the Second World War.https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Maurice_Edward_Denny He was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1944 for services to the shipbuilding industry. He later specialised in designing steering gear for the major liners such as the RMS Queen Mary (1934) and RMS Queen Elizabeth (1938).https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/William_Wallace_(1881-1963) In 1946 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Cameron Smail, Sir Ernest Wedderburn, Sir David Russell and John Barber Todd. He was knighted by King George VI in 1951. In 1954 he was the second recipient of the Churchill Medal awarded to major figures of British engineering.https://www.imarest.org/awards/churchill-medal The University of Edinburgh awarded him an honorary doctorate (LLD) in 1956.https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/William_Wallace_(1881-1963) He retired in 1959 after almost 50 years at Brown Brothers.

He is known for his work on the grammar of Scottish Gaelic, A double grammar English and Gaelic. == Biography == John Forbes was born in Strathglass, in the North West Highlands of Scotland, in 1818. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh and then worked as a teacher for several years. He was the schoolmaster of Fort Augustus in 1843 and one of the masters at the Normal Institute, Edinburgh in 1848. Between the years 1849 and 1851 he worked as an assistant at St Stephens in Edinburgh. In 1851 he was presented to Queen Victoria, and also ordained as a minister of the Church of Scotland. Forbes was minister in Kilmore, Sleat, on the Isle of Skye during a time of famine and poverty where he provided relief to his parishioners. He provided boys with an education and supported them in gaining entry to university. He retrieved young girls who had been lured to the mills in Manchester with false promises of well-paid work and wrote Weeping in the Isles, an exposé of the death of two girls and testimony from other girls returned to Skye. He also did his best to suppress sexual impropriety on the island. He married Jane Smith (d. 1874), whom he cut out of his will due to her alcohol consumption: \\"To my beloved wife personally I cannot entrust anything. Prudence and my sense of duty forbid it. I do it with grief and pain, because she has, during the last 18 years, proved herself utterly unworthy of trust or confidence, being unfortunately addicted to the vice of intemperance.\\" They had one son, Alexander Robert, an assistant keeper of the Court of Session's minute book and Gaelic scholar who published Gaelic names of beasts (mammalia), birds, fishes, insects, reptiles, etc. and Place- names of Skye and adjacent islands.

Segal, a licensed clinical social worker, examines the constructivist epistemology of physicist and philosopher Heinz von Foerster. Originally intended as a transcription of von Foerster's lectures, the book evolved into Segal's interpretation of von Foerster's constructivism written in everyday language. == Synopsis == The book begins with a foreword by Paul Watzlawick, a preface by the author, and an introduction which provides a synopsis of the book's content and structure. In chapter one, The Myth of Objectivity, Segal introduces the objectivity vs. constructivist epistemology debate, illustrated with examples of making sense of undifferentiated sensory input and eigenvalue puzzles, where the observer is necessary. In chapter two,The Difficulties of Language, the author describes what we can learn about epistemology from syllogisms, paradox, self- reference, and causality, finally focusing on the circular causality described in cybernetics. In the third chapter, Maturana and the Observer, Segal reviews Humberto Maturana's \\"observer-based science\\" where the object observed is not assumed to exist independent of the observer. The Nervous System is the next chapter, where Segal surveys the historical theories connecting perception and thought, including theories by Aristotle, Alkmaeon, Hippocrates, Galen, William Harvey, René Descartes, and Santiago Ramón y Cajal. In this chapter the author also looks at the evolution, structure, and function, of the nervous system and its relationship to the endocrine system. The fifth chapter, Computation, examines how computation happens in both computers and brains, using formal logic and trivial and non-trivial logical machines as conceptual tools to distinguish the two. Humans have capacity to \\"compute\\" in additional domains beyond mathematical-logical, including sensory and semantic domains. In chapter six, Biocomputation, Segal looks at how neural circuits work to calculate Boolean operations, and how these circuits fire in the presence of different but ignore sameness. In the final chapter, Closure, the author looks at closure across thermodynamics, mathematics, systems theory, and autopoesis. Segal goes on to examine the double closure of the nervous system along its sensorimotor and synapitc-endocrine dimensions. He returns to mathematics to examine recursion theory, cognition, and solipsism. The book ends with an interview with Heinz von Foerster conducted by media studies professor Carol Wilder. == Publication == The first edition of the book was published in 1986 by W. W. Norton. A second edition of the book was published in 2001 by Springer with some corrections from von Foerster. == Reception == The book received both mixed and positive reviews from the mental health and academic communities. Psychiatrist Peter Bruggen, reviewing the book for the Journal of Family Therapy, notes that Lynn's discussions around paradox, reality, and the role of the observer are easier to follow than other writers such as Bateson and Maturana, even if Lynn's logic is difficult to follow at times. Writing for Contemporary Psychology, David E. Presti questions Segal's application of neuroscience principles to questions of epistemology, while Klaus Krippendorff reviewing for the Journal of Communication praises Segal's ability to clearly present von Foerster's ideas, even if the book doesn't explore counterarguments. Linda Ade-Ridder writes in her review for Family Relations, \\"Written for anyone interested in exploring the concepts of objectivity and reality, this concise volume translates the ideas behind radical constructivism into a very readable form. Therapists will find the ideas particularly thought-provoking through the exploration of how language and logic shape thinking, especially within psychotheraputic models.\\" In The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy, psychiatrist Bill McLeod describes the book as \\"difficult but rewarding.\\" == References == Category: Systems theory Category: Epistemology of science Category: Cybernetics Category:Philosophy books Category:1986 non-fiction books ","title":"The Dream of Reality"},{"id":"60282526","text":"Russell Valentine Gardner is an educationist in the city of Dehradun.

Forstmann placing emphasis on equity investment and a close, collaborate relationship with a company's management. This, coupled with the industry's youth, served to contain PE investments to a comparatively small scale. However the large returns prompted new entrants to the sector. The expansion of the industry, along with the higher returns which could be earned by PE houses through employing debt in place of equity, created a market for a higher risk loan product; leveraged debt. This carried a higher risk profile than the investment grade corporate debt which had hitherto dominated corporate America. The 1980s innovations in debt capital markets led by Michael Milken's pioneering of high yield bonds (then called 'junk bonds') served to give the industry further mass, as did certain key takeover events such as the $25bn 1988 takeover battle for RJR Nabisco. Given the higher-risk profile of leveraged loans vis investment grade debt, original bank lenders would typically syndicate the debt, selling down some or all of their loans to other debt providers. The LSTA was founded in New York City (the focus point for America's loan market) on 26 December 1995 as the Debt Traders Association, Inc., before changing its name on 28 June 1996 to the Loan Syndications and Trading Association, Inc. to serve as an industry association for the sector, and to enhance its running and advocate for its expansion. The LSTA's involvement in corporate debt is not solely limited to private equity, but corporate debt more generally. ==Objective and work== The LSTA's mission statement is to \\"promote a fair, orderly, efficient, and growing corporate loan market and provide leadership in advancing and balancing the interests of all market participants\\". For this purpose the LSTA publishes standardised precedent documents to be used in loan creation (as the Loan Market Association does for EMEA), provides training seminars, and engages in public relations. ==Governance== The LSTA is headed by an Executive Director, currently Lee Shaiman.

There are three classes of membership: full members, associate members, and affiliate members. Full and associate members are typically market participants, whilst associate members are entities which have a strong interest in the market but which are not themselves market participants, such as law firms. The costs of the LSTA are borne by its membership. There are approximately 280 different members, all of them corporate or similar entities. ==See also== * Loan Market Association, the equivalent body for Britain, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and parts of Asia. * Asia Pacific Loan Market Association, the equivalent body for the Asia-Pacific region. ==References== Category:Finance industry associations Category:1995 establishments in the United States Category:Organizations based in New York City Category:Financial services in the United States ","title":"Loan Syndications and Trading Association"},{"id":"60282644","text":"Ronald Hunt (born 5 April 1929) is an Australian wrestler.

Many writers, translators and others were forced into exile, or faced stifling censorship and harassment if they remained. Spanish restrictions meant writing became one of the few acceptable occupations for women, and literate women with few other outlets for participation in Spanish society became voracious readers. Internationalism disappeared in the early days of Spanish literature. The 1940s and 1950s saw the most popular form of women's literature being romance novels. Despite important literary contributions like Carmen Laforet's 1945 novel Nada, the 1940, 1950s and 1960s were a period where the broader male dominated literary establishment refused to take women's literary efforts seriously. The major theme in women's literature was trying to understand women's place in society in the period between the 1940s and 1950s, changing in the next decade with women beginning to challenge their role in society and to argue more for women's rights in literature. The death of Franco in 1975 would see women writers liberated in the themes they could explore. In the early Francoist period, comic reproduced the gender roles advocated by the state, and were used to push this ideology onto children. Explorations of women's roles in society began to appear in comics in the 1970s, while women also began to appear as more three dimensional people and less as pure sex objects. Women were often portrayed as chaste, saintly figures who submitted to male authority in government approved domestic films. Starting in the 1950s, foreign movies in Spain presented women with images of beautiful and glamorous women who had their own agency. Censorship became a new reality for many women writers in Francoist Spain. Publishers were subject to government control, and the Catholic Church was highly influential in what was allowed to be published. This would not begin to change until the 1970s, when some restrictions were relaxed. == Overview == Following the Spanish Civil War, many writers, translators and other women involved in media production during the Second Republic went into exile. This included almost all Spain's most prominent feminist of the time. Those who remained faced repression, either because of their views or because of the language they spoke. Writing was one of the few culturally acceptable forms of industry for women in the Franco period because it did not require women to leave the home to take up the occupation. Lack of education though could often lead to problems in the quality of women's writing, which would serve to further marginalize women's writing and their broader exclusion from Spanish literary canon of the Francoist period as a result. With few other outlets for participation in Spanish society, many literate women spent hours a day reading various print publications and consuming other medium like radio programs. These included magazines, romance novels, history books, religious books and literary novels. This would inspire a new generation of women's writers and producers, both in print and other mediums. == Literature == === 1930s === In the post-Civil War period, women's fiction was often marginalized, unclassified and dismissed as unimportant. A body of this work has largely disappeared, serving in part to erase the daily experiences of women in the early Francoist period. Almost none of the works of Spanish women in the period would make their way into the Spanish literary canon, largely as a result of the literary community at the time being dominated by the male victors of the Spanish Civil War. Starting with the end of the Civil War, Catalan language materials would officially be prohibited in the press and media until the 1970s. This would impact many women writers during the Franco period. The start of the Franco period represented the start where internationalism disappeared from Spanish literature in favor of state favored domestically produced texts. At the same time, many of Spain's domestically produced works would not be translated into other languages or distributed internationally. Foreign literature would continue to enter Spain through more covert channels, bypassing censors. Spanish literature would not achieve any degree of major internationalism until after Franco's death, when many leading leftist Spanish publishers like Editorial Lumen would be acquired by international publishers like Random House. === 1940s and 1950s === Spanish writer Ana María Matute. The most popular novels written by women in the 1940s and 1950s were romance novels (), outselling all other types of women's writings. These were not serious literary works, but were intended for mass consumption. Carmen Laforet was the most important Spanish woman novelist during the 1940s, with her novel Nada published in 1945. It challenged Francoist Spain by showing a dirty underside that served as a counterpoint to the triumphalism of the Nationalists. Ana María Matute was one of the most important Spanish women novelists of the 1950s and 1960s. Her works were similar to that of Laforet and had Civil War themes, but represented a perspective of a child. The 1940, 1950s and 1960s were a period where the broader male dominated literary establishment refused to take women's literary efforts seriously. Francisco García Pavón asked in an interview about women's writings, \\"Are women's arms to weak for the oars of a great novel?\\" to which he basically answered yes. Consequently, there was very little serious criticism of women's writings and an erasure of their efforts in the immediate post war period. When their works were criticized, they were often compared only to works of other women in the past and found wanting. Some criticism in literary publications would comment on a female writers appearance, while taking very little note of her actual writings. When good women writers like Carmen Nonell were recognized, they were recognized in ways that sought to erase their gender. When women's works in the 1950s were perceived as offering social commentary on Spanish life, they were often subjected to critical commentary that tried to dismiss criticism of women as being an unnecessary female incursion into masculine life. At the same time, any promotion of the work of women writers as women writers was viewed as undermining women's creative and intellectual reputations. Male literary society believed women could only be properly supported by ignoring their status as women. A key theme of women writers in the 1940s and 1950s was understanding their role in society. Examples of such works include those by Carmen Laforet. Unlike earlier periods, these novelists did not use their writings to argue that women were entitled to equal rights. Their domestic writings did not espouse radical philosophies that would have challenged Francoist Spain. Overtly female Francoist writers were held in even less esteem than their male contemporaries, a situation that would continue throughout and after the fall of Francoism in Spain. === 1960s === The 1960s would begin to see a change in major themes in women's writings, with women beginning to challenge their role in society and to argue more for women's rights. This represented both self- realization in women expressed in fiction and a begin to a return of Republican era thinking about women. These writers were not intending to subvert Francoism, the Catholic Church or their parents, but instead were about improving their own situations and creating more opportunities. These women were not ideologically united for a variety of reasons, including their educational backgrounds, shifting positions in Spain sanctioned organizations like Sección Feminina, the lack of a clear ideological viewpoint from Francoism and that their beliefs contradicted societal norms which they needed to explore in more socially accepted methods to avoid censorship. During the 1960s, publishers were afraid to take risks in printing many new novels out of fear of Francoist interference, even when the established risks were low. This particularly disadvantaged women writers who already faced many commercial obstacles. Writers in the 1960s were often poorly paid and could not afford to live exclusively on money earned from their craft. Women had a slight advantage of their male counterparts in that social norms at the time meant middle and upper class women could more easily rely on their families for financial support. === 1970s === Catalan Esther Tusquets was an important woman author in the 1970s and 1980s, though her works are notable in this period for being unlike her peers in exploring themes of Catalan nationalism. Starting in 1975, as a direct result of the death of Franco, women writers in Spain were liberated for the first time in the subject content for which their works could focus on. This led to them exploring things such as sexual desire and fantasy. This period marked the beginning of a self-made era where women's work was equal to that of their male contemporaries, based on the merits of their work while being created in female defined spaces. Following the death of Franco, the most important novel published was by a woman. At the same time, a group of women novelist emerge to describe feminist life in post-Civil War Spain. They had started writing in the 1940s, with a second cohort joining them in the 1960s when censors began to relax. === Literary awards === Between 1945 and 1960, the Nadal Award was given to women six times. The 1958 Nadal Award had 175 entrants, of which 58 were women. The awards committee's willingness to consider women's writings on par with that of men made it particularly attractive for women, and it acquired a reputation as \\"fama de feminista\\". Among literary circles, this resulted in a loss of prestige for the prize, with it becoming known as the \\"premio dedal\\" or the thimble prize. This was a result of the patriarchal male dominated literary establishment doubting the talents of women based purely on sex related factors. Writers such as Mercedes Salisachs were particularly looked down upon by this male group as they were viewed as prize collectors, instead of serious writers. In 1953, the Premio Fémina was created by the publisher Colenda to be a women's only equivalent to the Nadal Prize with the intention of encouraging more women to become writers. It had a prize of 50,000 pesetas. The inaugural prize, in a 63 participation deep competition, was given to Carmen Nonell for her work Zoco grande. The Ateneo de Valladolid created Spain's second women's only literacy award in 1962, with the Premio María de Molina. The prize money was only 10,000 pesetas. === Feminist writers === Margarita Nelken, María Martínez Sierra and Carmen de Burgos had all been pre-Civil War feminist writers. Following the war, their work was subjected to strict censorship. Spanish feminists in Spain in the post Civil War period often needed to be active in exile. Works produced by these writers including Nada by Carmen Laforet in 1945 and La mujer nueva in 1955, Primera memoria by Ana María Matute in 1960. Writings of some foreign feminists did find their way to Spain, including the Le deuxième sex published in French in 1947 by Simone de Beauvoir. Inside Spain, well connected, often aristocratic Spanish feminists were sometimes able to publish their works for domestic consumption by 1948. This includes works by María Lafitte, Countess of Campo Alanaga, and Lilí Álvarez. Works by Republican pre-war feminists like Rosa Chacel and María Zambrano, who continued to write from exile, also saw their works smuggled into Spain. Following the war, many women artists went into exile because of there leftist leanings. Those who remained often had to deal with censorship of their work by the Franco government. British Surrealist Leonora Carrington traveled to Spain in 1940, seeking to find her partner Max Ernst who had left Germany was on the run from the Gestapo. Her trip happened only months after the Civil War officially ended, and the arrest of Ernst precipitated a mental breakdown that eventually saw her put into an asylum in Santander after her father and the British government agreed. While there, she was regularly dosed with Cardiazol and restrained naked over a six month period. She was eventually released, and then went to Lisbon. It was in the immediate start of the Franco period that Gregorio Martínez Sierra would sign a notarized declaration stating that half the works previously published under his name in the Second Republic period were actually the writings of his feminist MP Socialist wife, María de la O Lejarraca. Some Catalan women writers who initially remained after the conclusion of the Civil War found they could not publish in Catalan in Spain and so also joined the exodus, including Mercè Rodoreda. Rosa Chacel had fled abroad and might have been able to return but refused on principle. María Zambrano was the same. Many women writers of the Second Republic period found their works banned by the government or shunned by the reading public. Some writers who remained like poet Carmen Conde found they had to completely reinvent themselves to accommodate the realities of a new Spain. By the mid-1960s, Lidia Falcón, a Barcelona based lawyer, had established herself as a leading feminist in Spain at a time when the women's liberation movement in the country lacked a formalized ideology and structure found in other European countries and the United States. At the same time, feminists texts like Simone de Beauvoir's Le Deuxième Sexe and Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique began to be circulated more underground, helping to shape the emerging Women's Movement. === Sección Femenina === Sección Femenina was active in promoting both women to become writers and women's writers in general. This was a result of many of its most influential members being writers. They include Carmen de Icaza, Mercedes Formica, Mercedes Ballesteros, Eugenia Serrano and Ángeles Villarta. Many women writers got their first opportunity to write in part as a result of Sección Femenina publications. Sección Femenina published women's works, comments from readers about short stories they published, and reviews of women's writing in non-Sección Femenina publications. One Sección Femenina publication casually refers to these women, stating, \\"The university has seen the arrival of these girls who study happily, write novels and organize group activities and have overcome the traditional passive attitude of their predecessors as they follow the route of intelligent to become part of a minority in our nation's life.\\" === Lesbian literature === Spanish lesbian literature has three main periods. The first is from 1964 to 1975, during the last years of Francoist Spain. The second is the transition period of 1975 to 1985. The last period was from 1985 to the present. Novels featuring lesbian characters in Francoist Spain included Ana María Matute's 1964 novel The Soldiers Cry at Night (). The lesbian character is featured as a morally reprehensible woman. The next major novel was the 1967 Premio Nadal finalist The Last Summer in the Mirror () by Teresa Barbero, where the lesbian couple is portrayed as being bad women who struggle to conform with their social reality. The next major novel is Julia, published by Ana María Moix in 1969. The main lesbian character expresses sexual desires for other women including her aunt and a professor. Celia Bites the Apple () by María Luz Malecón in 1972 implies through its lesbian characters that being a lesbian is a result of trauma or people who provide a bad influence on their lives. Time of the Cherries () by Montserret Roig in 1976 is an example of the cliche of students in an all girls school having lesbian sexual experiences. During the 1960s, Ester Tusquets and her brother Oscar were the owners and influential forces behind the left leaning antidictatorial publisher Editorial Lumen. Starting in 1968, following the departure of Oscar, the publisher began publishing works by gay men, women in general and lesbians specifically, along with foreign works, cultural theory texts and children's stories. The first major out lesbian writer was Andrea Luca. Gloria Fuertes, Ana María Moix, Ana Rosetti, Ester Tusquets, Carme Riera, Elana Fortún and Isabel Franc were all in the closet in Spain or the first stages of the transition. Lesbian writers did not start to come out until the 1990s. Despite the liberalization of Spanish society in the immediate post-transition period, literature featuring lesbian characters tended to conform to historical type of being secondary figures and representing insubordination against oppressive heteronormative societal norms. == Comics == Spanish comics followed an established European tradition dating to the 1900s, utilizing the styles of Rodolphe Töpffer and Wilhelm Busch. Comics developed concurrently with mass culture, especially that being exported by the United States. Spanish comics did not use the American model. First getting popular during the pre-Civil War period, Spanish comics were inserts in satirical and children's magazines. They were known as tebeo. Tebeo is a phonetic adaptation of TBO, a long-running (1917–1983) Spanish comic book magazine. Elena Fortún's works, especially those about Celia, a young girl who questions adults and the world around her in ways that were both ingenuous and innocent, were popular in pre-Francoist Spain; they offered veiled criticism of bourgeois society. In the early Francoist period, comic production was limited and easily controlled by the state. They reproduced the gender roles advocated by the Francoist government, being used to push this ideology onto children as part of a lifelong push for people to become readers. This included by creating specialized markets for both boys and girls, where comics were included as part of gender segregated primary education. Despite Franco's controls, the 1940s and 1950s are considered a golden age of Spanish comics, and many titles were at the height of their popularity.Porcel (2002), 69-70. In comics for girls, \\"the woman was taught to suffer and hope that, with the passage of time, the high divine design of motherhood could be fulfilled.\\"Ramírez, Juan Antonio. (1975) El “cómic” femenino en España. Arte sub y anulación, Edicusa: Madrid. Mis Chicas, a comic for girls, was first published in 1942. It would become a model for many comics for girls going forward. The magazine was \\"inserted ideologically in the environment of educational separation that was advocated officially in the post-war Spanish.\\" The comics would popularize the names of Azucena, Ardillita, Margarita, Florita, lupita and Mariló in a new generation of Spanish youth. The comics gave beauty tips, included recipes and gave behavioral advice. During the 1950s, as a result of American troops being stationed in Spain, American comics began to impact the Spanish comic scene. Daily newspapers would begin carrying a daily comic strip. Still, the government imposed the 1952 Infant and Juvenile Press Norms () to make sure that comics did not encourage female emancipation. Divorce could not be depicted. Women could not be shown as being deceptive towards men. During the 1950s, the focus shifted from rural life to industrial life. It then soon transitioned to the world of fantasy. Despite this, female characters continued to be virtuous, waiting for the right man to come along for her to marry. Questions around gender and women's roles in society began to appear in comics during the 1970s. Consequently, the nature of female characters began to change. Women in comics became less sexually objectified and began to take on more dimension, not being passive characters. Anna María Moix discussed in a 1976 edition of Vindicación Feminista about how comics were a reflection of culture, serving as a modern form of fables and myths that had \\"an educational purpose in the induction of norms, behaviors and codes of values.\\" Analysis of women's comics was first done in 1975 with El cómic femenino en España. Arte sub y anulación by Juan Antonio Ramírez. It primarily focused on pre-1950s Spanish comics. Second-wave feminism was manifested in Spanish comics in two ways. The first was that it increased the number of women involved in comics production as writers and artists. The second was it transformed how female characters were portrayed, making women less passive and less likely to be purely sexual beings. == Newspapers and magazines == The number of and variety of opinions in newspapers greatly declined in Francoist Spain from the Second Republic period. Women were regular contributors to Spanish newspapers and magazines from 1940 to 1975. Lidia Falcón wrote of this period, \\"Literature continues to be the poorest and most lowly of intellectual pursuits.\\" Popular magazines for young women included Mis chicas (1941-1950), Florita (1949-1961), Sissi (1958-1967) and Lily (1970-1977). ¡Hola!, Spain's most popular and typical Spanish gossip magazine, was first published in 1944. It would continue to be the best selling magazine of its type until the mid-1990s when it was replaced by Pronto. Most of the readership of this type of magazine was female. Women were initially attracted to this type of magazine because they allowed people into the private lives of celebrities without pathologizing people's lives or condemning them as social problems. Abortion was not allowed to be discussed in newspapers, only by male medical doctors. During the 1940 in Aragon, there were almost no references abortion. The few references that did used euphemisms. One example was in an article by Pedro Galán Bergua in Heraldo de Aragón on 1 January 1942 \\"The evil is not in those who marry, but in the married who are satisfied with the reduced offspring and go to methods condemned by God and for the country.\\" State controlled or supported religious, medical, legislative and newspapers sources from the 1940s give an impression that all women accepted the imposition of the state around the topic of abortion and its relation to the need for the maintenance of the population size. Despite this, one estimate in 1943 by Matemólogo de la Sanidad Nacional Angel Clavero Núñez estimated one abortion for every three live births. The first opposition press in Spain was created in 1963 with the founding of Cuadernos para el Diálogo that would continue in print until 1978. In 1964, Spanish exile women began publishing Mujeres Libres again. The magazine Vindicación Feminista as published between 1976 and 1979. Coming out after the death of Franco, it was the first militant feminist publication to be published in Spain since the 1930s. Poder y Libertad replaced Vindicación Feminista following the ratification of the new Spanish constitution in 1978. == Radio == During the first thirty years of Francoist Spain, the dominant medium for consumers was radio. Radio was very popular with women in the 1940s because it could be listened to in the private domain, but also collectively at places like work. The Spanish government took advantage of this by using sentimental music to indoctrinate women. Mundo femenino, Consultorio Femenino de Marta Regina, Radio Fémina, and La hora de Francis were all radio programs aimed at women between 1947 and 1984. They regularly attracted total listeners of between 25,000 and 30,000 listeners. The 1950s saw the introduction of serialized narratives on Spanish radio. They included Llamas de redención, Se abren las nubes, La sangre es roja, La segunda esposa, La verdad escondida, Sangre negra, and Lo que nunca somos. These radio series were also popular with women listeners. Starting in the 1940s, women began to become much more involved in journalism, with their participation accelerating into the 1980s. By that time, it was not unusual to hear women on the radio or see them on the television. Starting in May 1946, Sección Feminina, in conjunction with their magazine Ventanal, began an hour long Monday night weekly radio program that focused on women's writers. Their first interview was with Rosa María Cajal. They would also interview Blanca Espinar, Dolores Pérez Camarero, María José Pomar, Carmen Martín de la Escalara and María Antonia Morales. Despite their intention of promoting women's writers, most of their interviews and commentary were often in support of state goals, namely in reinforcing women as being passive with their primary role being wives and mothers, not writers. Radio would reach its peak importance in Spain for women during the 1950s. It served as an important integration tool for women who moved from the rural countryside to urban areas. == Television == Television Española (TVE) began in 1956 with an hour of daily programs. One year later, in 1957, TVE had five hours of daily programming. In this early period, it was primarily funded by the state. By 1963, this had changed with 92% of its funding coming from commercial activities while producing 66 hours of programming a week. Victoria Prego began her journalism career in 1974 working for TVE in the international section. By 1976, she headed the department. She moved to London in 1977 where she became the London RTVE correspondent. At the time, there were few women working for the organization on air as tv or radio correspondents. Even those with news gathering roles were often forced to complete menial tasks by their male dominated newsrooms. == Movies == Movies were generally condemned by the Catholic Church as they saw them all as subversive towards the Church, the state and the role of women. Dubbing became a feature early on in Spanish cinema. This was a result of two factors. The first was Spain had high rates of illiteracy. The second was it was easier for movie distributors to add a new sound track than it was for them to add subtitles to foreign films. This policy was formalized into law in 1941, along with the requirement that all foreign film distributors have a license to show the movie. Francoist Spain argued in requiring this that it was needed to preserve both Spanish language and Spanish culture. They wanted to also make sure that Hollywood did not negatively influence Spanish women by making them think that a woman had an important role outside the home. In Francoist approved domestic films, women were often portrayed as chaste, saintly figures who submitted to male authority. Women could not see their everyday domestic life depicted on film. Exceptions to this norm included roles played by Aurora Buaista, and Spanish folk singers Juanita Reina and Lola Flores. These exceptions though were largely limited to allowing women to be represented as people with personalities in a music only context. There were a few domestic films in the 1950s which broke this mold, including Manuel Mur Oti's 1957 movie The Battalion of Shadows, featuring a group of women living in tenement housing. Movies featuring women as Madonna like mother figures include the 1949 film Little Matters, the 1951 film Burrows (), and the 1979 film Mama Turns 100. This image of women would not begin to change in Spanish movies until the early 1960s. Women were also sometimes featured in Spanish films of the 1940s and 1950s as whores, offering a counterpoint to the sainted Spanish woman. It was not until the 1960s that these two views of women began to merge, with distinctions between type being less important to the narrative. Starting in the 1950s, foreign movies in Spain presented women with images of beautiful and glamorous women who had their own agency. This image conflicted with the state presented image, which demanded women surrender agency to their husbands and fathers and become mothers. These movies also served to bring Spanish women out of their international isolation. They also helped spur a generation of younger women to question their place in society and decisions made by their mothers. This would later be a factor in bringing about large scale social changes during the transition. Because of censorship, movies deemed offensive in Spain it could not be viewed in the country. One of the methods to get around this was for Spaniards to take organized tours to French towns like Perpignan where they could watch these films. These buses would often form large caravans traversing the border. One of the biggest female stars of Spanish cinema in the late 1950s was Sara Montiel, who despite playing morally unobjectionable roles was still sexualized by producers where possible by highlighting her voluptuous form in costume. As Montiel's characters were viewed as being more three dimensional, she found many female fans. Natalie Wood, Audrey Hepburn and Julie Andrews were some of the stars of the screen during the 1960s in Spain. They represented the idea of the fragile and innocent woman that the government support. It was not until the end of the 1960s that Audrey Hepburn, Sonia Bruno, Concha Velasco, Teresa Gimpera and Sara Montiel began to appear in Spanish cinema, portraying women as strong and independent. == Music and dance == Marisol Lacalle and Segundo García in the zarzuela Doña Francisquita. Some forms of music were openly tolerated and supported in Spain, though expression within these genres was subject to censorship and artists were not fully independent. These included zarzuela, flamenco, copla and pasodoble. They essentially became stuck in time during the Francoist period. In small towns like Picassent and Silla, the people who were allowed to show off their singing skills were primarily men, as it was viewed as unseemly for women to put themselves forward in this way. A major theme in traditional songs became the female body and the beauty of a woman's virginity being protected. In small towns, musical life would often center around the Church. Sección Feminina had groups dedicated to music and dance. They were less about promoting and encouraging music than they were about using both music and dance to reinforce government sanctioned gender roles. They only supported traditional Spanish music styles. Dance was particularly problematic in this period. National Catholicism taught that dance was a moral and social ill, that encouraged the mixing of the sexes. At the same time, dance was viewed as hugely important for creating a form of social cohesion and towards social activities. == The stage == Ana Diosdado became Spain's most important contemporary woman playwright. She started out as a novelist, publishing her first work in 1964. Starting in 1970, in the later stages of Francoism, she switched to writing plays. Olvida los tambores was written and performed on Spanish television in 1970. Los comuneros was written in 1974 and used the reign of Carlos I to act as a historical allegory to criticize the Francoist government. Yours for the Asking () was a critique of a consumerist society that manipulated women. Her works would continue into the post-Franco period and well into the 1990s. == Advertisements == Advertisements were used by the Franco government to further perpetuate their vision of the ideal Spanish women. Advertisements for working class women in the early Franco period included ones for hygiene and cleaning products, food substitutes, and pharmaceutical products. Upper class women were targeted with advertisements for many luxury products. In 1975, the UN International Year of Women, Banco de Bilbao made a television advertisement encouraging women to open accounts with them that said, \\"That determined walk is the symbol of the woman of our day, of the responsible woman who works and lives her time. And to her, for the first time, a bank addresses this message of friendship, this tribute of admiration.\\" == Pornography == In the early transition period, Spanish pornography was often cruder and had inferior production standards than internationally produced pornography. Consequently, foreign produced pornography dominated the internal Spanish market. While the issue of pornography was of interest to feminists in the transition period, it was not center to their political activities as they had other goals they wanted to work on first before seriously visiting the topic. Most of the condemnations of pornography in this period consequently came from conservative women opposed to sex more generally and seeking to return to a more traditionally family centered period. == State sanctioned works == Spain approved women's instructional manuals during the 1950s and 1960s followed the style of Spanish Baroque conduct manuals. Themes in these works included the marriage market in Spain, and how to navigate it in religious, political and sexual contexts. In their later period, they highlighted the growing gender conflicts in the family. Guerra Gallego and Carmen Sebastián published some of the most popular fictional books that prepared Spanish women for married life. Sebastián's works represented a Vatican supported perspective of marriage. El Angel de Hogar was a series of French books by Catholic publisher Desclee de Brouwer that were translated into Spanish during the 1950s and 1960s that served as guidebooks for women in how they should behave in marriage. Some books included René Boigelt's El Matrimonio: El Libro de la novia, and El Matrimonio: El libro del jóven 17 a 20 años. The series also included works on motherhood. == Censorship == Censorship became a new reality for many women writers in Francoist Spain. Publishers were subject to government control. The Catholic Church was highly influential in what was allowed to be published. Depictions of women were censored by the media in Francoist Spain. Suicide, abortion, nudity, drug use, and alcohol and alcoholism were often considered taboo subjects that would warrant censorship by the Spanish State. Starting in 1962, censorship across Spain began to officially relax. Further changes to relax censorship occurred four years later in 1966. One of the ways to journalists would get around censorship was to avoid direct criticism of Franco and the military. Scholars such as Michael Ugarte suggest that censorship may have been advantageous to some writers, as it required the \\"sharpening of the writer's traditional tools: irony, allusion, ambiguity, association, multiple signification and other devices that enhance the sophistication of the writing and the reader's reception of it.\\" Children's magazines and women's magazines were heavily censored in Francoist Spain. Authors who faced censorship included foreign writers like Nadine Gordimer, Margarite Duras, Doris Lessing, Dacia Maraini, Mary McCarthy, Carson McCullers, Nathalie Sarraute and Mary Wollstonecraft. The writings of Frederica Montseny and Dolores Ibárruri were particularly a target of censors, with the government also targeting both women who had fled abroad for their own safety. Despite her leftist leanings, Carmen Conde took care to try to represent all the victims of the Spanish Civil War in the 1967 Spanish language edition of Mientras los hombres mueren in Obra poética so as to avoid to potential that the government would censor her work. Despite lifting of censorship, many translated texts continued to contain censored versions well into the 2010s. This includes Grace Kelly and Clark Gable's 1953 film Mogambo. In its Spanish dubbed release had a husband and wife replaced with two brothers to avoid representing adultery in the film. Whole parts of the film were also removed. This censorship still exists in Spanish dubbed versions. == References == Category:Women in Francoist Spain Category:Cultural history of Spain Category:Arts in Spain Category:Entertainment in Spain Category:Mass media in Spain Category:Feminist mass media ","title":"Women's media in Francoist Spain"},{"id":"60282783","text":"Women in the workforce in Francoist Spain faced high levels of discrimination. The end of the Spanish Civil War saw a return of traditional gender roles in the country. These were enforced by the regime through laws that regulated women's labor outside the home and the return of the Civil Code of 1889 and the former Law Procedure Criminal, which treated women as legally inferior to men. During the 1940s, women faced many obstacles to entering the workforce, including financial penalties for working outside the home, job loss upon marriage and few legally available occupations. Spain's economic picture began to change in the 1950s, and there was more economic pressure for women to enter the workforce. Some groups like Sección Feminina and Falange responded to this by offering women childcare services in a limited context. Skilled jobs like nursing were highly gendered, with men and women receiving differing educations. The 1960s would see Spain go through a cultural and economic transformation, with the law trying to slowly catch up. Reforms included more opportunities for women in the public sector and women no longer being fired because they were married. More legal reforms took place in 1970, though women's professional opportunities in fields like medicine continued to be limited. == History (1939–1975) == === 1930s Francoist Spain === The policy of the Franco regime with regard to women was a huge setback for the Republic as it set out to impose the traditional Catholic family model based on the total subordination of the wife to her husband. It reduced women to their place in the home as the Labor Charter of 1938 proclaimed changes in order \\"to free the married woman from the workshop and from the factory.\\" This hindered women's access to education and vocational and professional life and abolished or restricted their rights both in the public and private domains. One example involved Franco returning to the Civil Code of 1889 and the former Law Procedure Criminal, which sanctioned the legal inferiority of women. Women who had been behind Republican lines found themselves locked out from a number of professions just because of the place where they had lived. These included civil service jobs, teaching positions, journalism, and places in professional organizations. The 1938 Law of Family Subsidies had a negative impact on women's ability to work. By the end of 1939, women could not register as workers at employment offices unless, as heads of family, their economic situation forced them to work. === 1940s === Numerous obstacles were placed on the work of women, especially married women, and restrictions were placed on their registration in placement registers, requiring their husband's authorization to be hired. In addition, numerous labor ordinances stipulated that as soon as she married, a woman had to leave her job, being compensated with a dowry. A so-called \\"plus family\\" function, established in 1945, served as a financial aid whose purpose was \\"to strengthen the family and its Christian tradition, the perfect society and the foundation of the Nation.\\" In addition, the access of women to large sections of the public administration, especially as superiors, was prevented by law. Women were not permitted to become lawyers of the State, judges, prosecutors, diplomats, property registrars, notaries, labor inspectors, exchange agents or stock exchange employees. Women were also unable to take any jobs related to the military on the grounds that they needed to be protected from war. However, these measures could not prevent women from working, for \\"obvious reasons of family subsistence\\", but always with lower salaries than men, between 30 and 50% less. Women also participated in labor disputes that, according to a provincial delegate of the OSE, \\"for reasons of their sex and special way of reacting, it is very difficult to convince with reasons, or to discuss them with arguments\\". In the 1940s, women were barred from a number of professions as a women's primary job was to be a homemaker. They were prevented from becoming lawyers or judges or roles within the Ministry of Justice. Teachers were purged from the classroom in Spain on a regular basis for a variety of reasons. In Valencia, these included providing sex education or information about contraceptives. Working women could receive a salary 70% less than that of men working exactly the same job. The Labor Regulation Act of 1942 stated that women had to sign a voluntary dismissal form within a month of being married that resulted in them losing their job. After that, these newly married women had to wait two years before they could re-enter the workforce and only then, if they had permission from their husband. The Labor Contracts Act of 1944 meant women needed permission of their husbands before they were able to sign an employment contract. This act also had a clause that said to work in the industrial or commercial sector, women needed to have proof they had been vaccinated and a doctor's note saying they did not have a contagious disease; no similar requirement existed for men. The 1945 Plus de Cargas Familiares had a negative impact on women's ability to work. Because of labor market restrictions related to marriage, the vast majority of working women were between the ages of 15 and 25. Most women worked as domestic servants or in commercial service jobs. The vast majority of women had their official employment listed as \\"housewife\\". These were women who engaged in domestic labor inside their home for outside clients, doing tasks like cleaning laundry. Women in agricultural jobs were often listed as \\"housewife\\". Their presence in agriculture was largely unchanged from the pre-Second Republic period. Women in the industrial sector were primarily concentrated in the textile industry. Women were concentrated in sales clerk and primary school teaching positions in the service sector. Many would have precarious working conditions. In 1942, the average seamstress made 6.74 pesetas a day. The average female agricultural worker made 7.08 pesetas a day. Midwives made between 40 and 525 pesetas for every birth they attended. In the 1940s, women represented only 15% of workers in industry and 23% in the service sector, which included domestic servants. A lack of jobs in the 1940s also led to male resentment against women, as the men believed women were stealing their jobs and interfering with their right to work. This often meant women were vulnerable to being paid less or accepting casual jobs. Women who did work were doubly burdened, as they were expected to maintain the home, take care of the children in addition to working outside the home. Married women with young children often had high results of absenteeism on full-time jobs where they were expected to work 40 to 48 hours a week. Young, single, childless women had lower rates of absenteeism than their married counterparts with children. Successful married women in the workforce in 1940s, 1950s and 1960s were often blind to their own privilege, and they were often unsympathetic to other women with similar double burdens. Women working outside the home in the 1940s were often demeaned and devalued by others who were unsympathetic to their economic situation and tried to impose their belief that these women should stay at home. ==== Medical jobs ==== One of the differences between nursing as an occupation in Spain and in English-speaking countries was that the latter had deep roots in the feminist movement. This was not the case in Spain, where nursing was viewed as a lower rung in the broader Spanish medical hierarchy. Even in the face of international programs like the Red Cross and visiting medical professionals from abroad, Spanish medicine resisted making its hierarchy and teaching practices less sexist. Men and women received different training for the same roles, be it being a midwife, nurse or medical practitioner. Training for women was focused on maintaining the woman's virtue and on her alleged inferior intellect. In Francoist Spain, female nurses were treated as carers, while male nurses were treated as healers. This was a result of gender biases in teaching and the concept of scientific knowledge possessed by each gender, especially in the medical context. Caring was more centered around the home, while healing was performed outside the home. Because midwives appeared to be so frequently involved in sharing knowledge about abortion and contraceptives and performing abortions, the male-led scientific community in Spain tried to marginalize these women. Professionalization in medicine would help to further relegate the importance of midwives in Spain. Further attempts to dislodge midwives from the birthing process included accusing them of witchcraft and quackery, trying to make them appear unscientific. This was all part of a medical and eugenic science driven effort to reduce the number of abortions in Spain. === 1950s === The situation of women began to change in the 1950s and especially in the 1960s as a result of the economic and social transformations that took place in those years. It led to \\"a progressive increase in women's legal salaried work, as well as greater access to the middle and upper levels of education. And all this involved changes in the family structures themselves, the increase in the presence of women in public spheres and a greater diffusion of alternative models on the female condition, which contrasted clearly with the values fostered by the official Francoist approach. It was not until later labor shortages that laws around employment opportunities for women changed. The laws passed in 1958 and 1961 provided a very narrow opportunity, but an opportunity nevertheless, for women to be engaged in non-domestic labor outside the home. Adelia Díaz commented on women's issues in the 1950s: \\"The woman depended on everything from a man, she did not have a bank account in her own name, it had to be either with the father's name or, once married, with the husband's name.\\" Money from women's jobs would be put into bank accounts controlled by husbands and fathers, with women unable to access these funds. Sección Feminina and Falange provided childcare services during the 1950s and 1960s to women working in the agricultural sector. Official women's participation in this industry were around 5.5%, but informal participation was much higher, resulting in the need for childcare. ==== Medical jobs ==== The introduction of the Ayudante Técnico Sanitario (ATS) in 1952 increased gender inequality in the medical field. Women, unlike men, who enrolled in ATS programs were required to board at the school; men could commute in for their classes. Women were taught a course called, Home Teachings () where the male equivalent was Medical-legal autopsy (). ==== Servants ==== Many maids faced unwanted male sexual attention they could not escape, and were sometimes sexually assaulted. They would become pregnant and forced out of their jobs. Men would also blackmail them over these relationships. Because many were unmarried, when relationships were discovered, even those resulting from male coercion, they would be fired for being involved. This would leave these women destitute. Many turned to prostitution as they could find no other source of income. === 1960s === Technological innovations of the 1950s and 1960s pushed a lot of women into the workforce at a time when Spain's economy was undergoing a radical transformation. A change in the law on 22 July 1961 made it easier for women to gain employment in the public sector. Despite less stringent laws, they still faced many restrictions, including the need for their husband to approve their job before allowing them to sign an employment contract. The 1961 Law on Political Rights was supported by Sección Feminina. This gave women in the workforce additional rights they had previously lacked by recognizing the importance of their work. This law entitled single women being to a salary equal to that of her male peers working in the same job. Pilar Primo de Rivera commented, \\"The law rather than being feminist is, on the contrary, supportive of what men can give to women as the emptier glass. Why else would we want the man's salary to be sufficiently remunerative so that women, especially married woman, would not have to work out of necessity! I assure you that if family life was sufficiently endowed, 90% of women would not work. For us, it is much more convenient and more desirable to have all the problems solved. But there are many families not just in Spain but around the world that cannot dispense with working women, precisely because it ensures there is enough for their children's care and education, the primary goal of marriage.\\" Discrimination in employment based on gender was banned in 1961, with exceptions for the judiciary, armed forces and merchant navy. Reforms also meant that women were legally guaranteed the same wage as their male counterparts. In 1961, 4% of all Spanish women between the ages of 16 and 65 described their occupation as professional writer. This occupational description included both fiction and non-fiction writers, romance novelists and newspaper reporters. Until 1962, women were forced to leave the workforce when they married. In exchange for doing this, they were given a small monetary compensation. A 1963 legal reform meant employers could no longer dismiss women because they were married. Nevertheless, the law still required women to have their husband's permission before starting work. In 1966, the law was amended to allow women to be magistrates, judges and prosecutors. A Decree was issued on 27 October 1967 that supported the principle of equal pay for equal work. Trade unions were officially not allowed in Francoist Spain with the exception of the Falange led union organizations. These tended to attract little female membership. When they did, Falangist women would often find themselves working alongside socialist and communist women and would serve as a focused source of opposition to the regime before Comisiones Obreras was banned in 1967. Comisiones Obreras served a pivotal role in positioning the PCE as a leading union organizer and key opposition player during the Franco period. CCOO would also attract critical Communist women's anti-regime activists, among the most important of the area. === 1970-1975 === In 1970, only 4.4% of all physicians were women. A 20 August 1970 Decree brought in new legislation on maternity leave. Pregnant women could now leave the workforce without penalty for a period of between one and three years. Other rules that changed as a result of this decree included the eliminating of gender discrimination during periods of apprenticeships. Another change was that working women could continue their jobs after they married or could terminate their contract early by paying a compensatory dowry. == References == Category:Women in Francoist Spain Category:Women by occupation ","title":"Women in the workforce in Francoist Spain"},{"id":"60282798","text":"Faruque Alam (born 1 March 1940) is a Bangladeshi Civil Engineer, Wood Technologist and former Chairman of Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Corporation (BIWTC).

The repression behind nationalist lines during the war and the immediate years that followed left many politically active women with few choices but to leave or face death. The exact totals of women who were murdered, fled or disappeared is unknown, as it was only possible to make estimates. For those who had been politically active, a number continued to oppose the regime from exile. This included Republican militants broadly who sometimes coordinated together. It also included Mujeres Libres. Unlike other groups, most militants only became active as a result of the war. Consequently, they were less politically in exile and only saw a resurgence in the mid-1960s. Partido Comunista de España (PCE) was the most active political group both inside Spain and abroad. PCE's Unión de Mujeres Antifascistas Españolas (UMAE) attracted large numbers of politically active female Spanish exiles. They were not about liberating women as part of a broader agenda, but instead imposed strict gender norms. Women from Partido Socialista Obrero Español (PSOE) also went to Mexico, with four of PSOE's five Second Republican female deputies, Veneranda García Manzano, Matilde de la Torre, Julia Álvarez Resano and Margarita Nelken, going into exile in Mexico. Women gained leadership positions in exile, both in groups in Mexico and France. Some returned and were elected to the Cortes. Women who had been involved with POUM also went into exile, with Mika Etchebéhère the most notable of these. The group would reform following World War II but would dissolve again by the mid-1950s with María Teresa Carbonell, wife of POUM's last President Wilebaldo Solano, helping found Fundació Andreu Nin to keep the group's legacy alive. Basques were also subject to repression in Francoist Spain. Women in the Basque Nationalist Party also went into exile, with many helping in charity work, worshiping activities and propaganda efforts. They also worked to preserve Basque culture and language in exile. Some would return from exile following Franco's death in 1975. == Going into exile == As a consequence of the Spanish Civil War, over a million Spaniards died, another million were forced into exile and an unknown number disappeared. Franco's regime continued Civil War-based reprisals until the end of World War II, with an estimated 200,000 people being executed by the regime or dying in prison in that period for their alleged Republican links. Adolf Hitler provided support for Franco during the Spanish Civil War. Following the collapse of the Republic in 1938 and the establishment of recognition of the Nationalist government in February 1939, many women went into exile. Women in refugee camps in France often found themselves in squalid conditions. Pregnant women had few facilities to give birth and they were often inadequate. Swiss aid worker Elizabeth Eidenbenz arrived at the camps on the frontier in December 1939, and immediately set about improving maternity services. In the period between December 1939 and February 1944, the facilities she helped to establish saw 597 births of Spanish, Polish and Jewish women. Eidenbenz helped many of the women to get papers and visas for themselves and their children. Despite better facilities, many things could not be done including cesarean sections. As a consequence, information morality rates remained low, with many newborns dying within weeks of their birth. Women who remained were subjected to economic reprisals by the regime. In Galicia, around 14,600 people were victims of such reprisals. Former Republican A Gudiña mayor Florinda Ortega Pérez was one such victim. The Government confiscated her business and all her property, along with fining her 10,000 pesetas. This bankrupted her and forced her into exile. == Exile groups == === Republican militants === Most of the resistance in Spain during the early Franco period was a result of guerrillas, who coordinated their activities in the interior both with political militants in exile and with militants in prison. Most of Spain's militant women who remained in the country were in prison or had gone underground where they served as important figures in coordinating activities between all three groups. Prisons in this case proved invaluable for many militant women as they allowed them to rebuild their activist networks or create new networks. They were also one of the biggest sources of female resistance to the Franco regime by exercising daily resistance behind prison walls. PSOE, UGT, PCE, CNT, Juventudes Socialistas de España (JSE), Movimiento Libertario Español (MLE) and the Moviment Socialista de Catalunya (MSC) continued their struggle in exile. From 1944 to 1960, the French city of Toulouse served as a major publishing hub for many of these organizations' home in exile. The city of Toulouse itself would see around 40,000 exiles from these groups settle permanently in the city. === Mujeres Libres === The CNT aligned women's group, Mujeres Libres, had its leaders generally flee into exile abroad with the notable exception of Lucía Sánchez Saomil who went into internal exile. Mujeres Libres disappeared from the scene during the early Francoist period. This was largely a result of most of the women involved not having been involved in militant activities before the start of the Civil War. Sara Berenguer was a CNT affiliated miliciana in the Spanish Civil War. The poet was forced into exile in France after the war, where she wrote about her experiences and that of other women who fought with her. In 1964, Spanish exile women began publishing Mujeres Libres again. === Partido Comunista de España === Partido Comunista de España became the dominant clandestine political organization in Spain following the end of the Civil War. It would retain this position until the death of Franco saw PSOE replace it. Women were involved with the party, helping to organize covert armed resistance by serving in leadership roles and assisting in linking up political leaders in exile with those active on the ground in Spain. During the later part of the war and at its conclusion, some women from POUM were coerced into making false confessions in Moscow courtrooms, and then sent to Soviet prisons. Their major crime was being Trotskyites. PCE aligned Unión de Mujeres Antifascistas Españolas (UMAE) attracted large numbers of Spanish exiles in France in the immediate post-war period. It faced more challenges recruiting members in the interior. The group published a magazine in France called Noticias del interior, which discussed the activities of UMAE women working in the interior and manifestos written by these militants. In Paris in the mid-1940s, UMAE took pains to make clear that women could be involved with the organization while keeping up with all their domestic work. PCE did not want to scare away more traditional women by making the organization too focused on male militant activities. Further, they also wanted to broaden their support base to include traditionalists and Catholic women who firmly supported traditional Spanish gender roles. Activities for women included supporting prisoners, fund- raising, protecting children, acquiring clothing for distribution to other exiles in need and providing snacks for PCE party events. Neus Catalá and Irene Falcón were both involved in PCE in the exterior in the 1940s. === Partido Socialista Obrero Español === Following the end of the Spanish Civil War, the leadership of PSOE went into exile and reconstituted themselves externally with their leadership largely based in France. Inside Spain, PSOE shrank to all but a few militants mostly based in the Basque country and Asturian UGT strongholds. Socialist women also went into exile during and after the Spanish Civil War. Oran, Algeria, received around 7,000 members of PSOE and UGT who fled into exile as a result of the Spanish Civil War. UGT and PSOE party member Selina Asenjo Puello went into exile in Argentina after 12 years in France. María Lejárraga also spent time in exile in many European and South American countries. Spanish Socialist women in general found their most welcome home in Mexico. Four of PSOE's five Second Republican female deputies eventually sought exile in Mexico. These women included Veneranda García Manzano, Matilde de la Torre, Julia Álvarez Resano and Margarita Nelken. In 1943, Claudina García Perez was invited to serve on the interior Executive Commission. She also served on the PSOE First and Second Executive Commission in the same period. Franco's government spied on her and persecuted her, before hunting her down with the intention of arresting her. García Perez then fled into exile in France in December 1946. The International Socialist Conference in Zurich in June 1947, with García Perez serving as the secretary of the Feminine Section of PSOE. She then moved to Mexico in February 1948. The early Francoist period saw both PSOE and UGT largely absent from leadership positions. The only socialist woman in leadership for PSOE was Carmen Maestre Martín, and she was actually on the executive committee of Junta de Liberación Española (JEL), which was not founded until February 1943. On 30 January 1944, she was appointed to the Sección de Trabajo, Previsión, Asistencia y Sanidad del Consejo Técnico of JLE. Matilde de la Torre and Julia Álvarez Resano had both been expelled from PSOE in 1946, and became political non-entities as a result. Dolores Arizaga went into exile in France following the end of the Spanish Civil War. She would serve as a representative of Section of Tarbes (Hautes Pyrénées) at the II PSOE Congress in exile in 1946. Carmen García Bloise joined the socialist movement as the daughter of a Spanish PSOE exile in Paris in 1948 when joined Juventudes Socialistas. Agrupación de Socialistas Asturianos en México member Purificación Tomás played an important role among socialist women in Mexico in the 1940s and 1950s. She was affiliated with the UGT affiliated exile group Círculo Pablo Iglesias. In 1942, Spanish Republican groups in exile met in Mexico, forming the Unión Democrática Española (UDE). Participants included PSOE, UGT, Izquierda Republicana (IR), Unión Republicana (UR), Partido Republicano Federal (PRF), Unió de Rabassaires and Aliança Nacional de Catalunya (ANC). Partido Comunista Española (PCE) was excluded as communists were out of favor following the end of the Spanish Civil War.Heine, Hartmut (1983). La oposición política al franquismo. De 1939 a 1952. Barcelona: Crítica. . PSOE, UGT, PCE, Confederación Nacional del trabajo (CNT), Juventudes Socialistas de España (JSE), Movimiento Libertario Español (MLE) and the Moviment Socialista de Catalunya (MSC) continued their struggle in exile. From 1944 to 1960, the French city of Toulouse served as a major publishing hub for many of these organizations' home in exile. The city of Toulouse itself would see around 40,000 exiles from these groups settle permanently in the city. During the 1960s in Mexico, Purificación Tomás played a leading role among exiled socialist women. She was in charge of organizing the IX Congreso of PSOE in Mexico in 1964. Purificación Tomás created the Secretariado Femenino, with the goal of integrating women's issues into the broader Spanish socialist movement. She built and maintained contacts with the Socialist International Women. Carmen García Bloise represented the Paris Section at the XI PSOE Congress in 1970 and 1972. From 1970 to 1972, Carmen García Bloise was a substitute member of the PSOE Steering Committee in exile based on her position in the 6th area (Seiene). Carmen García Bloise would be appointed the Secretary of the Formación del Militante by the new PSOE committee following the XII Congreso of PSOE that saw the interior finally come into power. Palmira Pla Pechovierto returned from Venezuelan exile in the late 1970s. The teacher immediately became involved with PSOE in Castellón, and went on to represent the area in the 1977 Constitutional Legislature of Spain. === Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista === Most of POUM's leadership were in Republican prisons in Barcelona near the end of the Civil War at the hands of PCE who acted at the behest of the Soviet Union. Some managed to escape to exile in France, but thousands were stuck in concentration camps. Later, they were accused of opposing the French government and some were sent to German concentration camps. After the end of World War II, POUM constituted itself legally abroad. El Combatiente Rojo was published by POUM starting in 1939. It was one of several publications produced by POUM militants in the decade after the Civil War. Mika Etchebéhère was a POUM militant who went into exile in Argentina following the war. In a letter to friends in the United States, she said of her experiences, \\"Sometimes, it seems to me that as long as life is this dreadful quagmire that drowns us, no matter how many efforts we make to try to live normally, they will not be of any use. To live, to hold onto the light, to enjoy the sun, to eat every day, to read books, to what extent all this seems to be wished, forced. Deep down, you feel that you do not live, that you are vegetating, that you are floating.\\" In another letter, she said, \\"The beings that I love the most have died or are absent and I see this strange fact: I live increasingly away from the beings that surround me, and I take refuge in memories, in the past. I cannot find a place in reality. I'm constantly upset, hurt. Beings and things that I endured perfectly before, now make me nervous and exasperate me to a point that I came to believe myself seriously sick with nerves. The effort that I do to improve myself exhausts me, and I end up shutting myself up with books and memories. Anyway, I'm not worth much lately. However, I hope that one day I will get better.\\" Other POUM women militants in exile expressed similar feelings of isolation and being torn apart inside. María Teresa Carbonell married the last POUM President Wilebaldo Solano in the 1950s. She assisted him in running POUM's headquarters in Toulouse. She later helped found Fundació Andreu Nin in order to keep the legacy of POUM alive. === Basque Nationalist Party === PNV's women section, Emakume Abertzale Batza, was created in April 1922 in Bilbao and closed in September of the following year. It was re-created on 23 June 1931. Following the war, most of its members were forced into exile in France, Belgium, England and Catalonia, where the organization was reconstituted and would never return to Spain. Many Emakume Abertzale Batza women stood out from other Republicans in that they were Catholic and celebrated mass in refugee camps. Their first board in exile included President Concepción de Azaola, Vice President María Teresa Salcedo, Secretary Angeles Zuazagoitia, Deputy Secretary Martina Bernal de Azurmendi, Treasurer Garbiñe de Urresti, Deputy Treasurer María Elosua de Irizar, and members Alava de Miremón, María Olondo de Etxebarria, Miren Irujo, and Miren de Guerricagoitia. The French group was involved with charity work, worship activities and propaganda efforts. They also encouraged other Basques to subscribe to PNV publications. The women constructed two chapels in refugee camp hospitals. They also organized a Basque language course. They tried to help other Basque women find accommodation in Catalonia. They provided mail networks for clandestine PNV activities. Basque PNV women in exile in Argentina created a branch of the organization on 16 August 1938 called Acción Nacionalista Vasca. Women involved in the initial organizing of the group included Amelia Arteche de Jáuregui, Amelia G. De Menchaca, María Begoña de Orbea como Tesorera y Angelita de Bilbao, Arantzazu de Barrena, Ikerne de Kortazar, Antonia de Amorrortu and Miren de Muxika. Their goal was to keep Basque culture and language alive among exiles in the country. Garbiñe Urresti was another member of Emakume Abertzale Batza who worked as a nurse during the Civil War. She finally left Spain, going into exile in Caracas, Venezuela, where she was a member of the PNV and STV Junta Extraterritoriales. She joined and created local Basque cultural institutions in the city, and helped run a Basque language radio station. Julene Azpeitia was a teacher involved with PNV before the Civil War. She fled Spain following the war, but returned by 1947 where she took a teaching job at a Provincial Councila school of Bilbao. The regime punished her with jail time in 1949, and was let out in 1952.EIMA: Eskola- liburuetako onomastikaren, gertaera historikoen eta artelanen izenak.

Itziar Mujika Irastorza was Emakume Abertzale Batza member and secretary before the Spanish Civil War. During the war, she went to France where she became involved with the Francophone Basque Resistance Information Service, helping to clandestinely send messages to people in prison. She was given a death sentence in 1941, which was commuted the next year to 30 years and then freed in 1944 if she agreed to go into exile. Garbiñe Urresti returned from exile in Venezuela after Franco's death and ran a clandestine Basque language radio station. She helped prepare programs and helped prepare information for air. She also was an on air personality. == Motherhood == Republican mothers abroad addressed the problem of specifically being targeted by Franco's regime by creating the Unión de Mujeres Españoles (UME) in France. The purpose of the organization was to legitimize political activity of mothers as being part of the broader efforts of \\"female consciousness\\". UME published a magazine called Mujeres Antifascistas Españolas. The publication linked Republican women in exile with those in Spain, including some who were in prison. It honored women's roles as front line combatants, and suggested the special role of motherhood made their voices more valuable when it came to speaking out against the problems of the Franco regime. This contrasted with the beliefs of Spanish Communist women in exile, which suggested mothers in this period should fade into the background, serving in roles that supported single women and men who could be more visible in the struggle against Franco. Communists emphasized a traditional view of motherhood espoused by Franco. == References == Category:Women in Francoist Spain Category:Mujeres Libres Category:Communist Party of Spain Category:Basque women Category:Exiles of the Spanish Civil War ","title":"Women in exile during Francoist Spain"},{"id":"60282921","text":"Women in POUM in Francoist Spain were few as many, along with male dominated leadership, were forced into exile following the end of the Spanish Civil War. Those in exile often felt isolated and alone. Those who remained were sometimes sent to prison. POUM women participated in a hunger strike at Madrid's Las Ventas prison in 1946. The group fell by the wayside as Partido Comunista de España became the pre-dominant resistance organization in Spain. The organization finally dissolved during the 1950s in Toulouse, France with its memory kept alive by the wife of its last president, María Teresa Carbone, through the Fundació Andreu Nin . == Background == left Francoist Spain was a pseudo-fascist state whose ideology rejected what it considered the inorganic democracy of the Second Republic. It was an embrace of organic democracy, defined as a reassertion of traditional Spanish Roman Catholic values that served as a counterpoint to the Communism of the Soviet Union during the same period. It came into exist in 1939 following the end of the Spanish Civil War. Misogyny and heteronormativity where linchpins of fascism in Spain, where the philosophy revolved around patria and fixed gender roles that praised the role of strong male leadership. In July 1936, the Spanish Civil War started with a military coup attempt launched from the Spanish enclave of Melilla. In October of that same year, Franco took over as the Generalissimo and Chief of State in Nationalist zones. On 19 April 1937, Catholic and Falangist parties were merged, making Falange Española Tradicionalista the official state party behind Nationalist lines. On 30 January 1938, the first National State Cabinet meeting was held, with the Spanish Civil War formally coming to an end on 1 April 1939 and an official government formalized on 8 August 1939. The Franco regime banned all political parties and trade unions. The only permissible type organization was Falange, founded by José Antonio Primo de Rivera in 1933. An election was held in 1966, where people were given the option to affirm or deny Franco's leadership. With more voters than electors, Franco was affirmed as Head of State. Prince Juan Carlos was appointed as Franco's official successor in 1970, with Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco being the unofficial successor. Carrero Blanco was assassinated in 1973 by ETA. Franco died in November 1975. == Party history == Workers Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) was founded on 29 September 1935 in Barcelona as a result of mergers of the Bloque Obrero y Campesino and Izquierda Comunista. They would find support from many inside the anarchist union, CNT. By the mid-1936 and through to 1938, Spanish communist found itself in internal conflict between Stalinist and Trotskyites, with PCE lining up behind Stalin and POUM supporting Trotsky. The Russian backed Stalinist PCE started purging left-wing Trotskyites in the during the Civil War, culminating in the May Days of 1937 purges in Barcelona and the overthrow of Prime Minister Largo Caballero. POUM was damaged by these events, but did not disappear. Instead, members went into hiding until the end of the war and continued to publish La Batalla and Juventud Obrera. Most of POUM's leadership were in Republican prisons in Barcelona near the end of the Civil War at the hands of PCE who acted at the behest of the Soviet Union. Some managed to escape to exile in France, but thousands were stuck in concentration camps. Later, they were accused of opposing the French government and some were sent to German concentration camps. After the end of World War II, POUM constituted itself legally abroad. El Combatiente Rojo was published by POUM starting in 1939. It was one of several publications produced by POUM militants in the decade after the Civil War. == Women's history == POUM all but disappeared in Spain at the end of the Spanish Civil War, with PCE and PSOE being more successful at re-organizing. Women affiliated with POUM found themselves imprisoned following the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War. Most of the resistance in Spain during the early Franco period was a result of guerrillas, who coordinated their activities in the interior both with political militants in exile and with militants in prison. Most of Spain's militant women who remained in Spain were in prison or had gone underground where they served as important figures in coordinating activities between all three groups. Prisons in this case proved invaluable for many militant women as they allowed them to rebuild their activist networks or create new networks. They were also one of the biggest sources of female resistance to the Franco regime by exercising daily resistance behind prison walls. Águeda Campos Barrachina was one of POUM women imprisoned during the Franco regime as a result of her involvement with the group during the Civil War. In 1946, women political prisoners in Madrid's Las Ventas prison held a hunger strike to protest the poor quality of food they were provided. Women from socialist, communist and anarchist organizations came together behind bars to coordinate the strike. While they were successful in seeing food quality improved, prison officials subsequently reorganized the prison population to prevent further political collaboration within the confines of the prison. Anarchist ideas about abortion in the early Francoist period were informed by opinions exemplified by Director of General Health and Social Assistance of the Generalitat of Catalonia Félix Martí Ibáñez during the Civil War, with a policy called \\"Eugenics Reform\\" that included support of abortion by removing it as a clandestine practice. Their policies also included support of working class women, by attempting to provide them with economic relief so elective abortions were not needed. During the Civil War, the only women's anti-fascist group to support the legalization of abortion was POUM. Mujeres Libres never mentioned abortion nor contraception. Support of policies in favor of legalization consequently largely were made by leftist men. Women did not see abortion as part of a policy of women's liberation. During the later parts of the war and at its conclusion, some women from POUM were coerced into making false confessions in Moscow courtrooms, and then sent to Soviet prisons. Their major crime was being Trotskyites. It was only during the 1950s and 1960s that some of those women involved with POUM and Trotskyite purged began to re-evaluate their role in them; their change of hearts only occurred after Stalinist Communism lost its prestige among leftist circles. Many of those affiliated with POUM went into exile. Mika Etchebéhère was a POUM militant who went into exile in Argentina following the war. In a letter to friended in the United States, she said of her experiences, \\"Sometimes, it seems to me that as long as life is this dreadful quagmire that drowns us, how many efforts we make to try to live normally will not be of any use.

It occurred on April 7, 1971, at the embassy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Stockholm, Sweden. Among the victims was Vladimir Rolović, the ambassador, who was shot by the attackers, and died a week later. ==Background== On 10 February 1971, two Yugoslav men entered the Yugoslav Consulate in Gothenburg. They gathered and restrained all the Consulate staff on the premises, at knife and gunpoint. The two men, Blago Mikulić and Ivan Vujičević, demanded that the Yugoslav authorities release the convicted Miljenko Hrkać who was imprisoned in Yugoslavia and that he be brought to the Franco-controlled Spain with $20,000 in his pocket. If the demands were not met, the employees of the consulate would be executed. After just over one day's siege and fruitless negotiations with the Swedish police, they gave up and were arrested. Mikulić and Vujičević, who belonged to the organisation \\"Jadran\\", or the Black Legion, were later sentenced to three and a half years in prison. The Yugoslav ambassador to Stockholm, Vladimir Rolović, criticised the Swedish police in the media and saying they did not take the terrorist threat seriously enough, claiming that the Croatian separatists belonged to Ustashe, an organization that collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. The assailants were then popularly called Ustashe. ==Events== A few months later, on 7 April 1971, at the Yugoslav Embassy on Strandvägen 7B in Stockholm, Miro Barešić and Anđelko Brajković penetrated the building and took the ambassador Vladimir Rolović (a former OZNA colonel) hostage. He was struck across the face with a pistol and dragged into his room. The men tied Rolović to a chair, pulled a leather belt around his neck and shot him in the face and stomach. Several shots were fired, one penetrated a door and injured the embassy secretary, Mira Stempilhar. One of the men urinated on his hands to clean off Rolovic's blood, the other threw a portrait of Tito through the window. An embassy officer who tried to escape through a window was taken to the hospital. When the police arrived, they immediately stormed the building and forced the terrorists to surrender. The ambassador, fatally-wounded, was laying in a pool of blood on the floor. Barešić and Brajković stood in a corner with their hands in the air. On their way out of the building, they shouted \\"Long live the Independent State of Croatia\\" and \\"long live Ante Pavelić\\". Barešić and Brajković said they belong to Ustashe and also proclaimed that he wanted to punish Rolović for his visit to Canberra, Australia, where he was sent by the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry to inform the Australian Government of the Ustashe members who prepared terrorist actions in Yugoslavia from its territory. Rolović died a week later without regaining consciousness at Karolinska Hospital. The Yugoslav secret service has always maintained that Ante Stojanov, who was convicted by Stockholm District Court for complicity to murder, was, in fact, the mastermind behind the attack and aircraft hijacking, which Stojanov later admitted. He supervised the operation from a bar on Strandvägen. Ante Stojanov, was convicted of complicity to the murder of the Yugoslav ambassador, while his then twenty-year-old cousin Miro Barešić along with Anđelko Brajković were convicted to life imprisonment. Stojanov and the other two assailants, Marinko Lemo and Stanislav Miličević, was sentenced in the same trial to between two and four years in prison and deportation. The Swedish government was now under heavy pressure. The Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito immediately sent his Deputy Foreign Minister to Sweden. A furious Milorad Pešić was met at the airport by the State Secretary Thage G. Peterson. During the journey towards Stockholm and the waiting Prime Minister Olof Palme, a shocked Peterson were told how the Deputy Minister demanded that the arrested should be cut into pieces. He wanted them to be executed in Sweden as soon as possible or at least to be taken to Yugoslavia to be killed. The Swedish police investigation in 1971 had failed to uncover that the kidnapping of Rolović was not the goal of the attack on the Yugoslav Embassy. The Swedish-Croatian journalist Tonči Percan showed, after a thorough examination of the archive material in Stockholm 45 years later, and after talking with the mastermind behind the attack Ante Stojanov, that it really was an act of revenge. Rolović was to be executed. In 1969, the Yugoslavian agent Ilija Stanić had murdered the Ustashe general Vjekoslav Luburić in Spain. After World War II, Luburić had fled to Spain, where he was active in the Croatian National Resistance, and the State Security Administration (UDBA) pursued an intensive search for Croatian nationalists around the world. The attack in Stockholm was a revenge for the murder of Luburić. Before Rolović was murdered, Barešić had placed a photo of Ilija Stanić on the ambassador's desk; It was a message to UDBA and Tito that revenge was completed. ==Aftermath== The first and so far only aircraft hijacking in Sweden, that of the Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 130 took place at Bulltofta Airport on 15 September 1972. It was hijacked because the six Croats who were imprisoned for the murder of Yugoslav ambassador Rolović in Stockholm in 1971 would be released. The aircraft hijacking was already planned before the attack on the Yugoslav Embassy. Stojanov said in an interview in 2004 that if they were to get caught, their comrades would get them free by hijacking an airplane. Three Croatian men, Tomislav Rebrina (36), Nicola Lisac (44) and Rudolf Prskalo (29), from the fascist Ustashe movement held 86 passengers and 4 crew members hostage. In the end, six of the detained terrorists who were taken to Malmö were exchanged for hostages to be released. The hijackers also received half a million Swedish crowns, which they demanded. A seventh of those involved in the ambassador's murder refused to come along. The plane took off and flew to Madrid. The hijackers and their comrades were arrested and received extremely symbolic punishments - rather protection - in Spain which was then a fascist dictatorship under Francisco Franco. They were eventually released and scattered across the world. Some returned to Croatia in connection with the breakup of Yugoslavia. After the release from a Spanish prison, Barešić lived a flattering life for several years. He worked for a couple of years under a false name as a bodyguard for Paraguay's president Alfredo Stroessner. When he arrived in the United States in 1979, he was disclosed and extradited to Sweden. Again, he created headlines when he repeatedly hunger striked to get his life sentence timed and avoid solitary confinement. In 1985, the sentence was converted to 18 years in prison and in 1987 Barešić was able to leave Österåker Prison where he served his last time of the sentence. He was deported from Sweden to Paraguay. From there he finally returned to Croatia. Barešić was killed in action in July 1991, but the Croatian government kept his death secret for over a year so that the morale of the Croatian Army would not sink. He was appointed posthumously to general. Anđelko Brajković also returned to Croatia and retired as a colonel after the war. Both in connection with the murder of ambassador Rolović and after the aircraft hijacking, the diplomatic situation between Sweden and Yugoslavia was tense. Many Yugoslavians argued that the Swedish government should never have released the Croatian terrorists. The two attacks also caused great concern among the many Yugoslav immigrants in Sweden. However, as a result of the murder of Rolovic, the punishment for unlawful weapons possession and arms crimes in Sweden was tightened. In 1973, the much talked about terrorist law was passed, which gave the Swedish Security Service (Säpo) greater authority. Among other things, Säpo was now able to legally bug suspects phones and open their mail. The law also gave Säpo the right to expel a foreign citizen \\"with regard to what is known about the foreigner's previous activities\\". Stojanov told an interviewer in 2004 that he considered the ambassador's murder and aircraft hijacking as the start of the Croatian struggle for independence. ==See also== *Scandinavian Airlines System Flight 130 ==References== ==External links== *Bulltofta hijacking at P3 Dokumentär Category:1971 in Sweden Category:1971 in Croatia Category:1971 murders in Europe Category:1971 crimes in Sweden Category:Terrorist incidents in Europe in 1971 Category:Croatian nationalist terrorism Category:Sieges involving Sweden Category:Hostage taking in Sweden Category:Sweden–Yugoslavia relations Category:1970s in Stockholm Category:April 1971 events in Europe Category:Attacks on diplomatic missions in Sweden Category:1970s murders in Sweden Category:Terrorist incidents in Sweden in the 1970s ","title":"1971 Yugoslav Embassy shooting"},{"id":"60282949","text":"Rosemary Climbs the Heights is a 1918 American silent drama film directed by Lloyd Ingraham and starring Mary Miles Minter, Allan Forrest and Margaret Shelby.Guide to the Silent Years of American Cinema p.191 ==Cast== * Mary Miles Minter as Rosemary Van Voort * Allan Forrest as Ricardo Fitzmaurice * Margaret Shelby as Wanda Held * Charlotte Mineau as Mme.

Mossberg & Sons that was made until 2001. ==Features== The Mossberg 9200 series of shotguns are autoloading, gas-operated shotguns. Consistent with all Mossberg shotguns, this model series has the same ambidextrous thumb-operated safety switch positioned in the middle of the receiver. The Mossberg 9200 series uses 2¾ or 3 inch Magnum shells. The 9200A1 was specifically designed to use 2¾ inch \\"maximum load\\" rounds such as #00 Buck. ==Variants== Two main versions were made: the 9200 and 9200A1. The 9200 was a general platform with several grades of finish and features and primarily intended for hunting and sport shooting. Versions of the 9200 include Crown Grade, Combo, Camo, and Viking. The Crown Grade model had a high-quality Walnut hardwood stock, polished blued finish, and a 22, 24, 26, or 28 inch vent-rib or slug barrel. The Camo models all had a synthetic stock, 24 inch vent-rib barrel and were camouflage coated. The Combo was a Crown Grade model with multiple barrel options included, and the Viking model had a synthetic stock and more rugged finish. Mossberg also produced a \\"Persuader\\" model under their \\"Special Purpose\\" line which had a parkerized finish, a synthetic stock, and an 18.5 inch barrel and was intended for tactical or law enforcement use. In May of 1998, the US Department of Defense issued a solicitation for a new shotgun called the Joint Service Combat Shotgun (JSCS) program. The JSCS program was tasked with choosing a successor shotgun to replace the current shotgun models used by the US Military. In response, Mossberg produced a variant of the 9200 called 9200A1 or \\"Jungle Gun\\"designed to the JSCS specifications and submitted for review, however, the 9200A1 was not selected. Mossberg also offered the 9200A1 for sale in their catalog through 2000. The 9200A1 had many of the features of the Persuader model, with the addition of a heavier barrel and fixed cylinder choke, however, the 9200A1 did not share barrels with the other 9200 models and had a different gas system design to accommodate the high power ammunition specified in the JSCS solicitation. ==External links== *Owners Manual 9200 and 9200A1 Autoloading Shotgun *Mossberg 9200A1 \\"Jungle Gun\\" Review by S.W.A.T.

The statue is an early example of an Egyptian statue belonging to a private individual. Metjen lived at the end of the Third and the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty (around 2600 BC). The statue is made of granite and about 47 cm high. It is datable under king Snofru. Metjen is shown sitting on a chair. His right hand forms a fist and is placed on the chest, the left hand is placed on the leg. Metjen wears short curly hair. On the sides of the chair are inscriptions providing Metjen's name and his titles.Günther Roederː Aegyptische Inschriften aus den Königlichen Museen zu Berlin, Berlin 1913, p. 68 online The statue was once placed in the serdab of the mastaba and was therefore only visible via a small hole in the wall.

As of April 2019, the number of measles cases reported worldwide represented a 300% increase from the number of cases seen in the previous year, constituting over 110,000 measles cases reported in the first three months of 2019. In the first half of 2019, the World Health Organization received reports of 364,808 measles cases from 182 countries, up 182% from the same time period of 2018 when 129,239 confirmed cases were reported by 181 countries. == Countries affected == In the United States, the number of measles cases was set to reach a 25-year high by the middle of the year, beginning with a large concentration of cases in the Pacific Northwest followed by another in New York, as well in the U.S. state of California with two quarantines ordered at two colleges in Los Angeles on April 28, 2019. Other countries reporting large increases included Brazil, Nigeria, Israel, Ukraine, Madagascar, India, and the Philippines. However, the largest and most fatal outbreak of measles in 2019 occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Other notable outbreak locations include the 2019 Kuala Koh measles outbreak, 2019 Philippines measles outbreak in Asia; the 2019 Pacific Northwest measles outbreak and 2019 New York measles outbreak in the United States; and the 2019 Philippines measles outbreak, 2019 New Zealand measles outbreak, and 2019 Samoa measles outbreak in Oceania. == Contributing factors == In some countries, this outbreak has been fueled by lack of access to the measles vaccine, while in others it has been exacerbated by opposition to vaccination. As one such example, the outbreak in the Philippines was attributed by Health Secretary Francisco Duque III to lowered trust in the government's immunization drive due to a controversy regarding administration of a dengue vaccine. The outbreak prompted President Donald Trump to shift away from his previous skepticism regarding vaccination, and to insist that parents must vaccinate their children. The Trump Administration also took a forceful position of requiring vaccination, with Trump's Surgeon General Jerome Adams calling for limitations on exemptions to vaccination. ==See also== *Vaccine hesitancy ==References== ","title":"2019 measles outbreaks"},{"id":"60283155","text":"The BAFTA Student Film Awards are an annual awards ceremony hosted by BAFTA as a showcase for rising industry talent.

In the immediate post-Civil War period, the new regime was not concerned with homosexuals in general, but instead were focused on changing laws to enforce restrictive gender norms like repealing divorce. While original laws banning homosexuality were on the books and enforced using a 1933 law, they were changed in 1954 and 1970. Unlike male homosexuality, lesbians were less clearly addressed by these laws and were much less frequently prosecuted for the crime of homosexuality. Lesbians from that period are hard to identify because they were not identified as such, and often identified as prostitutes instead. Lesbians were repressed in Spain, using cultural, religious, psychiatric and medical institutions to facilitate this repression. During the Franco period, lesbians were forced into an inescapable closet that sometimes led to suicide. Consequently, lesbian culture was pushed underground. Women had to meet clandestinely and use code words to identify each other. They created their own unique family units, married men or had fake marriages to gay men. Some entered convents. Being outed posed dangers, including that they would be subjected to electroshock treatment as part of conversion therapy. Still, lesbians through parties, went to the movies, and, starting the year Franco died, they created their own bar scene. Oculto sendero by Elena Fortún and the lesbian poetry of Lucía Sánchez Saornil were the most important works of early lesbian literature of this period, before the lesbian literary movement really began to take off in 1964 with works like Ana María Matute's 1964 novel The Soldiers Cry at Night () An independent history of lesbianism as a political movement in Spain does not begin until 1975, the year Franco died, as lesbian voices had been intentionally silenced prior to this. In this early period a transition to democracy, the voices of gay men were often louder with lesbians playing important support roles because of historically greater past gay male visibility and continuing patriarchy. In 1977, Barcelona based Front d'Alliberament Gai de Catalunya (FAGC) became the first gay men's organization to have a lesbian section. The first lesbian organization, Grup de Lluita per l'Alliberament de la Dona, in Spain would not be founded until 1979 in Barcelona. Political tensions would see lesbians split from gay men by 1981 and they would not join together again until the early 1990s. == Francoist definitions of womanhood == left Anyone who did not fit into traditional gender norms and who expressed any deviance from Roman Catholic sexual norms was viewed as a sexual pervert. While some women quietly questioned their biologically determined place in society, male intellectuals provided rationals to support Francoist policies that used medical and biological sciences, along with anatomy and physiological studies. These works often drew on phrenological works by doctors such as Franz Joseph Gall that were later translated into Spanish. Carmen de Burgos Seguí published one such translation in La inferioridad mental de la mujer which said, \\"Many female characteristics are very similar to those of beasts; mainly the lack of a main of their own. Since the beginning of times they have functions like that, hence the human race would be stagnated in its original state if there were only women.\\" Misogyny and heteronormativity where linchpins of fascism in Spain, where the philosophy revolved around patria and fixed gender roles that praised the role of strong male leadership. While not putting women in prison, this ideological position effectively made women prisoners of their home, with imprisonment aided by the Catholic Church and Spain's educational system. The ideology of Francoism was opposed to gays, lesbians, transgender people, asexuals and anyone who did not fit into neatly constructed and enforced ideological gender roles. Lesbians were a particular threat because lesbian women remove themselves from the process of biological reproduction.Platero, R. (2009). \\"Apuntes sobre la represión organizada del lesboerotismo y la masculinidad de las mujeres en el período franquista\\". En VVAA. (2009) Homosexuales y Transexuales: Los otros represaliados del franquismo, desde la memoria histórica. Barcelona: Bellaterra. Participa en el proyecto I+D+I Ref 140/07 The Catholic Church in Spain in this period continued to perpetuate teachings that subjugated women. This included a belief that women should be covered up, chaste and virginal. Any women who broke this mold were evil temptresses in the vein of Eve. Women were encouraged to model themselves after Mary, the mother of Jesus. Women were taught to be asexual beings. Women in Francoist Spain had problems meeting their own heterosexual desires, required through state indoctrination to forgo female sexual expression. Heterosexual female desire represented for men an undesirable and perverted female attribute. Lesbians faced this and more, with a reality that for most, there could be zero expression of any sexual desire, let along for that of other women unless they wanted to put themselves in opposition to the regime. Starting in the 1950s, Spain started adopting a more consumerist economy. This would continue on into the 1960s and would play a role in introducing Spanish women to the new modern Western woman. This introduction would result in the eschewing of the concept of True Catholic Womanhood. By the end of the 1960s, the destiny of lesbians in Spain was changing as women increasingly began to express their dissatisfaction with state imposed patriarchy. Their dissatisfaction would play a large role in the later collapse of the regime following Franco's death. == Societal views of lesbians == For many in the Franco period, lesbians were considered straight women who sought needed sexual satisfaction from other women because their sexual needs were neglected by men. For others, lesbians were any women who challenged stereotypical culturally enforced gender roles. Society did not conceptualize lesbians in the same way as it did gay men. Psychiatrists espoused a belief that women were lesbians because of the everyday desire to be a man in order to be with the mother. They also claimed it was a result of neurosis, narcissism, or immaturity. It was not a result of congenital or hereditary factors. Regime fear of homosexuality would lead to carefully curated single sexed spaces that reinforced gender stereotypes. Sección Feminina encouraged women's sport but only some. Athletics were viewed as problematic because they encouraged a more masculine style of dress to compete. The organization feared this masculine dress style would lead young women into becoming lesbians. With lesbian behavior being hard for militant patriachialists to conceptualize, it often meant it was harder for homophobes to attack them directly. While make it easier for lesbians to blend, broader cultural implications made it for this same culture to engage in widespread lesbian erasure. This erasure is expressed most clearly in Anna María Moix's 1969 work Julia. Ahead of the Year of the Woman, the government created eight commissions to investigate the status of Spanish women. The government used reports from these commissions to produce two reports that were published in 1975. They were La situación de la mujer en España and Memoria del Año Internacional de la Mujer. Among the findings were that the number of lesbians was increasing as a result of a number of factors including \\"physical or congenital defects\\", the \\"affective traumas and unsatisfied desires\\", family being unable to prevent women's conversation, \\"Contagion and mimicry\\" and \\"[...] the lack of relationship with men as a consequence of an excess education rigidly rigid, the existence of institutions that by their very nature eliminate these relationships: prisons, hospitals, psychiatric, religious communities etc ..., the media, tourism, alcohol, drugs and desire of search for new sensations, prostitution, and vice.\\" To tackle the problem of the growing lesbian population, the government commission proposed solutions like \\"early diagnoses and medical treatments and psychotherapeutics that [corrected] possible somatic defects\\", creating a sex education program and the promotion of the idea that both genders can peacefully co-exist. Tourism and urbanization were two leading causes for greater societal toleration of homosexuality in the waning days of the Franco period. == Laws around women and homosexuality == In the immediate post War period, the government's primary concern was removing political and armed resistance. LGBT people were not and would not be a major focus until they had eliminated these threats, and were able to force a form of conservative Catholicism on the populace. More pressing issues for lesbians included a return to a reduced legal status. The repeal of the law allowing divorce occurred on 23 September 1939, and severely restricted ways which in women, including gender non-conforming lesbians, could behave outside their homes by placing legal and cultural constraints on them.Daimon. Revista Internacional de Filosofía, nº 63, 2014, 207-222 ISSN: 1130-0507 The 1932 Penal Code with its concepts of “estado peligroso” and “defensa social” were re-purposed by Franco in 1954 to criminalize homosexuality as a sex crime. The 1933 Ley de Vagos y Maleantes was used by the Franco regime until 1970 to criminally punish homosexuals. The 1933 law meant the police could detain anyone they suspected of being a homosexual. The 1954 modification largely excluded lesbians from legal punishment as the law did not conceptualize that two women could have sex with each other. The 1933 constitutional replacement was the 1970 Ley de Peligrosidad Social, which labeled homosexuality as a mental illness. These laws would later be used to imprison women and to commit them to mental institutions. Under the 1933 era law, only two charges were against women. One of the woman prosecuted under the law was prosecuted in the period between 1971 and 1978. The other involved a woman named María Helena who was prosecuted in 1968. Under the 1954 law, only one lesbian was ever charged. Unlike gay men, lesbians were never legally assigned to specific penal colonies or mental institutions. Instead of using existing laws, lesbians in Francoist prisons were charged with prostitution instead of homosexuality, which makes it impossible to determine their true numbers when compared to gay men.Conxita MIR CURCÓ, Pobreza, Marginación, delincuencia y políticas sociales bajo el franquismo. Lleida, Ediciones de la Universidad de Lleida, 2005. This was because the regime had only two categories for women's employment: housewife and prostitute. Despite this, the Franco regime largely could not comprehend lesbian activism, and when they did, they took active steps to erase it. Because of a more active focus on the threat of male homosexuality as an affront to the regime, the number of prosecutions of women was always much lower than those for gay men, especially in the later years of the regime. This was also in part because lesbianism was never made illegal in the same way as male homosexuality as the regime never considered it to be a similar threat. Lesbians in Francoist prisons were charged with prostitution instead of homosexuality, which makes it impossible to determine their numbers when compared to gay men.Conxita MIR CURCÓ, Pobreza, Marginación, delincuencia y políticas sociales bajo el franquismo. Lleida, Ediciones de la Universidad de Lleida, 2005. This was because the regime had only two categories for women's employment: housewife and prostitute. Lesbians who did find themselves in prison were often easy blackmail targets for guards. This was because a number of lesbians had sex behind bars with other non-political prisoners and prison staff. Some of these relationships were non-consensual as female guards might use their power to force other women to have sex with them and rape them. At camps set up for sexually deviant women, lesbians and other women had their heads shaved and were subjected to a program of feminization that included prayer. Lesbians were among the prisoners held at Caserón de la Goleta, the prison for women in Málaga. The 1970 law was officially modified on 26 December 1978, and effectively ended active prosecution against \\"those who perform acts of homosexuality.\\" The enforcement removal did not come with any official state recognition. The law against public scandal continued to be enforced, with many transsexual women continuing to be detained in the following years. Because the law about homosexuality was not fully repealed in 1977 before the new constitution, homosexual men and women effected by it were not able to obtain amnesty like general political prisoners were. LGBT activists would later ask that these homosexuality related offenses be removed from their police identification records. A compromise was eventually made that saw these removed from their public records but maintained in the historical record accessible to historians because of their historical value. Homosexuality would not be fully decriminalized and LGBT organizations would not be allowed to operate in Spain until 1981. Following these early changes, the law and the rights bequeathed by it for lesbians would remain largely unchanged until 2005 with the introduction of the marriage equality law. In 2009, the Government of Spain passed a law providing compensation to gays, lesbian and transgender people who were imprisoned as a result of 1933 Ley de Vagos y Maleantes and 1970 Ley de Peligrosidad Social. There was a deadline of 31 December 2013 for people to file compensation claims. In 2018, the Townhall of Barcelona tried to bring six Spanish judges to trial for alleged crimes against humanity for the period between the 1950s and 1970 over their judicial treatment of homosexuals and lesbians. One purpose of this was to purge the official criminal record of 550 people in Barcelona who were charged with homosexuality related offenses. They faced a number of challenges, including a general amnesty law for members of the Franco regime. === Case of María Helena === 21-year-old María Helena was charged in Catalonia with violating the Ley de Vagos y Maleantes on 30 March 1968, with a file number of 296.Platero, R.

The charge against her read, \\"She was arrested when she was in the bar La Gran Cava, located on Calle Conde del Asalto number 25 in a suspicious attitude and dressed as a man. He has no background, stating that he does not engage in any activity, living off the charities he is given and sometimes making blood donations. He says that he dresses as a man so that he can deceive women towards whom he feels an irresistible inclination.\\" () The act that precipitated her arrest was drinking wine at a bar while appearing in masculine clothes, violating state norms by challenging the gender norms of the period. While there are elements of transvestism in the arrest sheet, it is unclear if she was transgender. In the sentencing decision, the court ruled, \\"Her clearly, defined and manifest tendency towards homosexuality, make it particularly dangerous to coexist with the young women who have received this patronage, whom she has already tried to make her homosexual practices in the few days she has been hospitalized. Such dangerousness [...] is what makes us put the aforementioned young woman at the disposal of that Ilmo. Special Court, especially when, to a greater extent, our rehabilitation services inform us in an absolutely negative sense as regards the possibility of reeducation of this young woman, given her age and characteristics.\\" () While initially held in a Barcelona prison, she was then transferred to the Women's Section of the Junta Provincial de Madrid prison facilities as a dependent of the Ministry of Justice. While in prison, her body and mental state are all examined by the state. This included searching for physical deformities, measuring the size of her clitoris and asking for detailed information about her sexual habits. Her final prison sentence term was given at between 127 days and one year in prison, followed by a 2-year mandatory ban from going to Barcelona, and two years of government supervision. This sentence followed guidance spelled out in the Ley de Vagos y Maleantes. María Helena's behavior was so transgressive that the state felt a need to interfere with it and punish it. Despite this, the state does not make clear if the problematic nature of her behavior is that it was homosexual and transvestite in manner. Government texts discussing her incarceration do not make clear if Helena was a butch lesbian or a trans man. === Case of M.C.D. === M.C.D. was sentenced to four months to three years in prison on 21 March 1974 because she was a lesbian. The charge against her was of being \\"a rebellious homosexual with her family who is in a dangerous state.\\" She was sentenced to re-education under Article 2 of the Law 4 of August 1970 of social dangerousness. Her sentence of for months was based on Article 6. She was arrested by a group of plainclothes policemen. M.C.D. was never sure why they arrested her, if it was because someone denounced or her behavior raised suspicions with the authorities. At the trial, her side did not put up any defense. In the end, the then 17-year- old served four months at the Alcázar de San Juan in Ciudad Real as the state determined that she presented a social danger and needed to be re-educated. Despite the re-education part of the sentence, none actually took place in the prison. Instead, women knit, sewed and did leather crafts. She was compensated, with a very poor wage, for these activities. After her sentence was completed, she was barred from \\"visiting nightclubs and public establishments where alcoholic beverages are consumed for two years.\\" Arrested when she was a 16-year-old, M.C.D. was interrogated repeatedly, where she was asked incomprehensible questions. She said of the experience, \\"For months I was subjected to a pantomime persecutory that I did not understand at all and that ended in a paranoia of lasting effects for life.\\" At the time of her arrest, she was a student. She was intellectually curious, always wanting to know how and why things happened. On 15 October 2009, M.C.D. filed a complaint with the government asking to be compensated for her incarceration. Her claim was approved on 23 December 2009. The claim was the first made by a lesbian woman. Members of the LGBT community hoped the case would encourage other lesbians to make claims and to assist in the broader lesbian community in reclaiming dignity stripped of them by imprisonment or internment in asylums during the Franco regime. M.C.D. said of her own experiences and desire for compensation, \\"The important thing is to remember so that it does not repeat itself, since sometimes it seems that we are going backwards.\\" By law, her name and place of residence could not be made public as part of the claims process. M.C.D. felt disgust over these limitations, but refused to provide her own details about her life as she felt it would put her and her partner's safety at risk. == Lesbian culture == Repression of lesbians differed from gay men in Spain in that cultural, religious, psychiatric and medical institutions were used to domesticate lesbians. Men in contrast were repressed using legislative and penitentiary tools. Gay male persecution was similar to that of other socially undesirable elements. Later, the regime would view male homosexuality as a contagion for which psychiatric tools could be used to prevent its spread. This resulted in the formalization of specialized centers for incarceration. Being a lesbian in this period was about being forced into the closet with no chance of escape. They hid their identities from family, friends, their church community and their employers. Homosexual women during the Franco period could only meet each other clandestinely, perpetuating a silencing of their voices and rendering them unintelligible to outsiders. The clandestine nature of their relationships rendered lesbians invisible and prone to having collective imagery about them negatively defined by the state and its apparatus. The need to constantly be alert to the potential of discovery of their orientation stressed out many lesbians. It could also lead to isolation, as they cut ties to groups who might discover they were lesbians. This included religious and social groups. Some lesbians could not deal with the pressures they faced and committed suicide. Because of the Franco regime's beliefs about women, including an inability to understand lesbianism, there was an underground culture available for lesbian women. Where multiple men using public urinals was suspect, girls having parties without boys in attendance was viewed less circumspectly as it was assumed by many that they were being pure by not inviting boys. Their invisibility protected lesbians in ways that it did not protect men because many people believed lesbianism did not exist. Lesbians would often use code words, such as librarian or bookseller (), to identify one another. Younger lesbians might identify each other by asking, \\"Are you a comic?\\" (). Because beaches were gender segregated, it was often an easy place for lesbians to socialize. They organized cabarets where they could more legitimately question gender norms while socializing strictly with other women. Lesbians created their own economic networks to insure their ability to survive. They also created their own spaces where they could feel free, including placed near Parallel and las Ramblas in Barcelona. Matilde Albarracín described their actions as they related to the regime and cultural attitudes of the time as, \\"So subversive.\\" Because the Spanish cultural and government apparatus have often been centered around the concept of family, many members of the lesbian community sought to create their own non-traditional family units. Later, in the post-Franco period, these lesbian family units would serve as political reasons for many activists seeking for rights recognition in areas such as claims of political asylum, adoption rights and the right to habeas corpus.Unmarried women could cohabitate together in a culturally acceptable way, being accepted or dismissed as cousins () while two men cohabitating together were attacked as queers (). These cohabitating women were sometimes mocked as women who could not find men who would tolerate them. These attitudes though helped to erase lesbians by allowing their preferential status as women who stayed at home to define them more than their orientation. At the same time, the lack of assumptions about the sexual nature of their relationships meant women constantly feared being outed. Some lesbians were married to men and had children. Some married after being in prison to escape societal pressures to conform. Other lesbians married before understanding their sexuality, and put these relationships at risk by meeting in secret with female lovers. Lesbians would sometimes feel guilty about what they were doing, feeling isolated and alone. This would sometimes drive women to go to church to confess to having impure thoughts. Sometimes, lesbian couples lived with a gay male couple. They might even use these men for semen donations, so they could have children and continue to portray themselves as culturally acceptable heterosexuals. With few outlets to escape the confines of marriage, some lesbians in rural areas deliberately sought out convents as a safer place to exist. The convent allowed them to more easily hide their sexual orientation and sexuality. Lesbians were at risk of imprisonment during this period because of their orientation. Families also highly disapproved, and conversion therapy using electroshock treatment was not unheard of. Some women died within a few years of being given electroshock treatment. This sort of conversion therapy and problems with family estrangement would continue on into the Spanish transition to democracy. For many lesbians, it would be a tough choice as to which was worse: prison or mental institutions where conversion therapy took place. In addition to the threat of conversion therapy, lesbians had to worry about other aspects of their family discovering their orientation. This included being disowned by their family or being assaulted by family members because of their orientation. In rural areas, lesbians were tremendously isolated. Their youthful experiences could be quite lonely and sad, as they had no one to turn to to provide guidance. Some of these lesbians sought to escape this life by moving to more urban areas. Some lesbians in rural areas sought to escape through education. Once that was attained, their options were often limited to teaching where they would continually fear being outed. If parents suspected teachers of being lesbians, they might and did withdraw their children from the school. 1920s and 1930s had created a fashion shift in Spain that allowed women to echo their foreign counterparts in wearing clothes and styles traditionally associated with masculinity. This enabled more self- expression among lesbians of the period. Franco's victory shut down this fashion outlet of expression, with the imposition of a generic feminine women's style that attempted to oblate female sexual identity. Lesbians ability to use clothes to express their sexuality would not happen again until the 1960s. Even though lesbians were given more freedom following the death of Franco, lesbian culture continued to be mostly invisible to the larger Spanish populace well into the 1990s, being referred to as the hidden homosexuality (). Gay men were out of the closet, but lesbians continued to be marginalized and hidden. During the Franco period, Chueca was a working-class neighborhood that was also home to many working class Spanish prostitutes. The area would later transform into one of the most important hubs of radical leftist Spanish thinking and be an intrinsic part of Madrileño LGBT identity. For lesbians in the late transition period, the act of sex became about ongoing negotiations on personal sexual pleasure as lesbian identity and culture were bound together with the concept of lesbians being able to express their own sexuality and sexual needs. === Social activities === Lesbians were not confined to their homes during the Franco regime. Many socialized with other lesbians and non-LGB acquaintances both in and outside their homes, with their own cultural norms and rules. When lesbians socialized with each other but still in broader society in places like theaters, cafes, cabarets and literary gatherings, they would use pseudonyms to make it harder for people to be able to identify them if they were inadvertently outed. La Cabana Cafe and the baños orientales at the Barceloneta beach were popular meeting spots in Barcelona. In urban areas, lesbians would sometimes throw women only parties. Because they were single and not sexually involved with men, while still in the closet, they were often accepted by their neighbors who viewed them as good examples of Spanish womanhood and who applauded their not socializing with men. They also developed their own social networks. One of the first lesbian bars to open in Spain was Daniel's, which opened in 1975 in Plaza de Cardona in the barrio of Sant Gervasi in Barcelona. The bar attracted a wide variety of clientele including university students, housewives, celebrities and lesbian prostitutes from across the whole of Spain. It had a dance floor with a red light. When the red light went on, it signaled a police raid, and women then sat down and started talking. === Media === The 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s are considered to be a \\"period of the catacombs\\" where literature for everyone in the LGBT community was underground. Despite draconian policies policing the LGBT community, lesbians were able to attain literature from abroad including French newsletters and magazines like Arcadia founded in 1957 which was more gay focused, Groupe de lesbiennes which started publishing in 1976 in Paris, and Quand les Femmes s'aiment, published from 1978 to 1980. === Literature === Eleana Fortún in Crónica Magazine, Madrid, June 1936. An open and accessible Spanish literary tradition for lesbians would not start until the end of Francoism.Sanfeliu Gimeno, Luz .\\"Lucía Sánchez Saornil; an alternative life and work to the society of his time \\" . Retrieved on 25 August 2016 . The most significant piece of Spanish lesbian literature in the early and middle Franco period was Oculto sendero by Elena Fortún, which while never officially published until 2017 was circulating by 1945 and told the fictionalized account of a Spanish lesbian in exile. The author was more famous for other works, and was the Spanish equivalent for many young Spanish readers as Richmal Crompton, Mark Twain or Roald Dahl were for American and British readers. The lesbian poetry of Lucía Sánchez Saornil fell into oblivion during the Franco period as the writer went into hiding and tried to anonymize herself in order to protect both herself and her partner. Spanish lesbian literature has three main periods. The first is from 1964 to 1975, during the last years of the Franco regime. The second is the transition period of 1975 to 1985. The last period was from 1985 to the present. Novels featuring lesbian characters during the regime included Ana María Matute's 1964 novel The Soldiers Cry at Night (). The lesbian character is featured as a morally reprehensible woman. The next major novel was the 1967 Premio Nadal finalist The Last Summer in the Mirror () by Teresa Barbero, where the lesbian couple is portrayed as being bad women who struggle to conform with their social reality. The next major novel is Julia, published by Ana María Moix in 1969. The main lesbian character expresses sexual desires for other women including her aunt and a professor. Celia Bites the Apple () by María Luz Malecón in 1972 implies through its lesbian characters that being a lesbian is a result of trauma or people who provide a bad influence on their lives. Time of the Cherries () by Montserret Roig in 1976 is an example of the cliche of students in an all girls school having lesbian sexual experiences. During the 1960s, Ester Tusquets and her brother Oscar were the owners and influential forces behind the left leaning antidictatorial publisher Editorial Lumen. Starting in 1968, following the departure of Oscar, the publisher began publishing works by gay men, women in general and lesbians specifically, along with foreign works, cultural theory texts and children's stories. The Same Sea as Every Summer () was published by Tusquets in 1978, while Love is a Solitary Game () was published a year later and the final book of her trilogy, Stranded () was published in 1980. These works were part of an important lesbian political literary criticism of the stresses faced by lesbians in try to exist in a heterosexist society. They were published in the same period as Carmen Riera's 1980 A Woman's Word (), another important work in the lesbian literary canon of the period. The first major out lesbian writer was Andrea Luca. Gloria Fuertes, Ana María Moix, Ana Rosetti, Ester Tusquets, Carme Riera, Elana Fortún and Isabel Franc were all in the closet during the Franco regime or the first stages of the transition. Lesbian writers did not start to come out until the 1990s. Most of the lesbian literary body in this period came from outside Madrid and Castile, with many being multi-lingual. Catalonia produced Riera, Roig and Laforet. Galicia produced Mayoral. Extebarria was a Basque from Valencia. Despite the liberalization of Spanish society in the immediate transition period, literature featuring lesbian characters tended to conform to historical type of being secondary figures and representing insubordination against oppressive heteronormative societal norms. While gay men were the more visible homosexuals in the Franco and transition period, women writers would be at the forefront of normalizing homosexuality in literature for the average Spanish reader in the final Franco years and first years of the transition. Women writers like Ester Tusquets were the first to break taboo subjects like female desire. Political feminism that saw lesbianism as a natural endpoint for women began to become a bigger theme in some feminist works of this period. === Movies === Homosexuality began to be addressed in a more open and liberal manner in Spanish films starting in the 1970s. Most of the important works were produced by men and featured male homosexual characters. Basque Eloy de la Iglesia was an important film director of this type in this era. Dark Habits () was released in 1983. Written by Pedro Almodóvar, it featured Julieta Serrano as a lesbian Mother Superior of a Spanish convent. The film was revolutionary in breaking the mold of conservative depictions of lesbians in Spanish cinema by using Serrano's character as a vehicle to criticize the Roman Catholic Church and by challenging the Franco driven view that only two type of women existed: decent conservative women and evil, sexually promiscuous liberal women. The film was rejected by the Cannes Film Festival on account of its apparently sacrilegious treatment of religion, and although it had its premiere on 9 September at the Venice Film Festival, some of the organizing committee considered it blasphemous and anti-Catholic and it was not shown in the official section.Edwards, Almodóvar: Labyrinth of Passion, p. 31 Almodóvar's provocative and in your face dealing with homosexuality Entre tinieblas and his 1982 film Laberinto de pasiones were viewed by parts of the LGB community as a necessary responsive to the oppressive nature of state-censorship during the Franco period that condemned and erased them. Liberal depictions of lesbians by lesbian film makers would not begin until much later, during the 1990s. Influential films of this period included 1996's Costa Brava by director Marta Balletbó-Coll and Ana Simón Cerezo. Electroshock (2007) is a film that shows the impact of imprisonment of lesbians during the time of Franco and the effects of electroshock conversion therapy. It was based on a real life story. The documentary Bones of Contention was released in 2017, and focused on describing everyday life for gays and lesbians during the Franco regime. The movie was written by filmmaker Andrea Weiss. == Lesbianism political movement == Lesbianism as a specific social, cultural and historical identity did not exist in Spain until during much of the Franco period. This was in part because while lesbianism was culturally taboo, norms around women allowed them to walk arm-in-arm down the street unmolested except by a few aggressive and insulting men. An independent history of lesbianism as a political movement in Spain does not begin until 1975, as lesbian voices had been intentionally silenced prior to this. This late emergence meant that lesbians had to largely independently political define themselves both inside the established feminist movement and the gay and transgender movement at a time when Spanish society as a whole and these movements specifically were undergoing major stresses as a result of the death of Franco. Despite this, lesbianism as a political movement still maintained a low profile, with a limited voice as part of broader discussions. Politically, lesbians in the immediate post-Franco Spain were often nothing more than supporters of their more vocal and visible male counterparts because of greater past gay male visibility and continuing patriarchy. Some radical feminists in this period would chose lesbianism as a form of exerting control over their sexuality that had been repressed by the Franco regime. There were arguments at the time over the way to be both a feminist and a lesbian.Amman, Gretel (1979). \\"Como lesbiana contra la nueva moral feminista\\". Ponencia en las Jornadas Feministas de Granada, December 1979. Marchante Barrobes, Karmele. (1980) \\"Las relaciones entre mujeres y la bisexualidad como alternativas sexuales en el feminismo radical\\". Jornadas feministas de Barcelona, p. 10. The lesbian political movement at the time largely concluded that lesbian sexuality \\"did not have to be soft or aggressive, nor follow any feminist or feminine pattern.\\" It was not until the mid-1990s that lesbianism as a unique political movement began to step independently into the political sphere, demanding legal equality and citizenship rights enjoyed by the rest of the Spanish populace. This period would herald in an exponential increase in the number of lesbian only political groups. Some groups would seek international affiliation and media attention, while others would seek to organize while hiding or downplaying their lesbian identities in the service of other women. For politically active lesbians during the late stages of the transition, a key component of their activism was about lesbian sexuality and the ability to express it freely, despite stereotypes that suggested women, and lesbians in particular, were less interested in sex because there is nothing after sex once the act of penetration is removed. For lesbians of this period, the act of sex became about ongoing negotiations on personal sexual pleasure. In Spain, the broader homosexual rights movement was known as GLTB during the 1980s and 1990s. This served to exacerbate gender imbalances in the movement, by signaling to women that they were not wanted. This would be slow to change when in relation to forming LGB identities, with lesbians being slower to abandon the femme/butch identity than Spanish gay men with their queen/bear identities.In other literature describing the period, the acronyms GL, GLB, and LG are often used, with B for bisexual and T for transgender not being used until a much later date as they were not connected in the same way to the previous period of orientation being defined around sexual acts and identities contrary to the reproductive needs of the Spanish state. Q for queer does not enter the conversation until a much later period, and often used in a contemporaneous context to describe historical events that are exclusively describing gays and lesbians as a short hand for homosexuality. Given these complex issues, the acronyms used in the article are based on ones used in sources to reflect this reality. Front d'Alliberament Gai de Catalunya (FAGC) became the first gay men's organization to have a lesbian section. The group was created in 1977 in Barcelona, after the first pride march in Spain. Maria Giralt was given a list of 30 names and phone numbers of women who attended, called them all up and got 10 to show up at Bar Núria for the new organization's first meeting. Being part of FAGC turned out to be problematic as the organization was full of blatant and latent misogyny. When the women asked the organization to create posters for their events, FAGC would often create them with phallic symbols all over them despite protests to not do that. This type of action by gay men would push many of these women into becoming radical feminism. The first lesbian organization in Spain, Grup de Lluita per l'Alliberament de la Dona, was not founded until 1979 in Barcelona.Hooper, John (2006). The new Spaniards . Penguin. 0-141-01609-4 . Despite this, lesbians continued to maintain a lower profile in the LGBT community in Spain than their gay male peers. When not maintaining a lower profile, they were actively ignored by their male peers as completely unimportant. It was not until 1987 with the arrest of two women for kissing on 28 July that lesbian political activism took on a bigger stage, with lesbian groups holding a massive protest with a public kiss at the Puerta del Sol in Madrid, which has been repeated annually since then. Tensions between gays and lesbians led to the creation in 1981 of the Colectivo de Feministas Lesbianas de Madrid (CFLM), and the Grupo de Acción por la Liberación Homosexual (GALHO), which was somewhat less radical than the Frente de Liberación Homosexual de Castilla (FLHOC).«De Pavlov a la lobotomía». Interviu. 5 de febrero de 2007. Consultado el 2 de marzo de 2014. Despite these external tensions, politically active lesbians faced fewer issues around internal dissent about ideology than their male counterparts. Shared experiences during the Franco regime acted as a social and political glue that bound them together strongly. They often found themselves politically situated among radical feminists of the period. Politically, lesbians and their gay male counterparts would continue to be separate through the final part of the transition period in 1985 and remain separated until the early 1990s when marriage equality became a goal of many in the broader LG movement.Unlike in some other countries, the concept of civil partnerships was never widely discussed in Spain as an alternative to marriage. This was in part because LG activists were insistent from the onset of the conversation that they demanded full equality under the law. While Partido Popular briefly considered the concept in 1997 and 2002, the LGB activists's political partner of PSOE understood the community was willing to make the sacrifices necessary to achieve full legal marriage equality. The LGB community's desire for full marriage equality was in part a response to what the realization of lesser legal partnerships under Partido Popular would actually mean and how they would be implemented. They feared that legally it could actually mean merely cohabitation. During the early 1990s, much of lesbian political thought was on practical issues, where there was not a heavy emphasis on developing broader LGB theory that underpinned their political activities. === Broader LG political movement === Barcelona was at the forefront of some early Spanish LG activism in the last days of the regime and the transition. Broader Spanish homosexual liberation movements during the 1970s were closer to the French movement, where personal and sexual liberation were perceived as necessary goals towards gays and lesbians developing a new social consciousness that would lead to a social revolution. It differed from American and British activists who were keen to develop political connections and change the legal status for members of the LG community, while maintaining links to explicitly leftist organizations. Agrupación Homófila para la Igualdad Sexual (AGHOIS), later renamed Movimiento Español de Liberación Homosexual (MELH) in 1975, was created in 1970 as a liberation movement for homosexuals. The purpose of the group was to influence the Church, arts, medicine, law, sociology and the press to change their stereotypical views about homosexuality and combat negative indoctrination which said homosexuality was evil. The mostly gay male Barcelona based group kept meetings to eight people or fewer in order to avoid attracting attention from the government. Revista española de investigaciones sociológicas. They felt compelled to start organizing in response to the 1970 Ley sobre peligrosidad y rehabilitación social. Their work dismayed other members of the LGBT community as they believed it entailed too much risk without any substantial reward. They started publishing an eponymous newsletter of the same name in 1972. Front d'Alliberament Gai de Catalunya was formed in 1975 in Barcelona, and two years later, in 1977, would host the first Spanish Gay Pride march which saw participation from lesbians, politicians and union members.«Front d’Alliberament Gai de Catalunya». L'Enciclopèdia.cat. Barcelona: Grup Enciclopèdia Catalana. This was the first LGBT political event in the country's history at a time when such protests were still illegal. 4,000 people took part, and lesbian marchers chanted, \\"Behind the windows, there are lesbians!\\" Lesbian participants included Maria Giralt. Following the achievements involving changes to the law to decriminalize homosexuality in the late 1970s following the death of Franco and transition to democracy, much of the GL activist structure was dismantled as the immediate needs in the transition period were perceived as having been accomplished. Consequently, the community also began to fracture along ideological grounds, particularly among gay liberationists. == Lesbian in exile == Carmen Conde, Victorina Durán, Margarita Xirgu, Ana María Sagi, Irene Polo, and Lucía Sánchez Saornil survived the war as Spain's most famous lesbians, but all were required to go into exile for their own survival. While relatively open about their orientation in exile, they all tried to maintain levels of discretion about it. Lucía Sánchez Saornil went into exile at the end of the Civil War, facing three disadvantages: being a woman, a writer and a lesbian. During the 1950s, 62-year-old Victoria Kent became involved with New York philanthropist Louise Crane, who was 15 years her junior, while living in exile. Starting in 1954, the couple published Ibérica: por la Libertad. The magazine was one of the most important publications among Spanish moderates living in exile. It only closed in 1974. It served to pressure the US Government to end its ties to Franco, even as the US sought to strengthen to combat the perceived communist threat. == Historical memory == Historical memory of LGBT people has often focused much more on gay men and the transgender community than around women more generally and lesbians specifically. This did not occur by accident, but by design as traditional gender norms in Spain always emphasized men as being more important than women. Consequently, historical memory focused on telling the stories of gay men first. The Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory was founded in 2000 by Spanish journalist Emilio Silva after he successfully located the remains of his grandfather and eleven others in a roadside ditch. Starting in 2002, he began lobbying for historical memory to become law, which it did in 2007 with the support of the Zapatero government as La Ley de Memoria Histórica. It did not overturn Law 46/1977 and Pacto de Olvido that provided amnesty for members of the Franco regime. By law, victims existed but perpetrators did not. One aspect of historical memory has involved identifying the bones of LGBT people killed during the Civil War. This is questioned by some, who do not understand how finding and identifying the bones of Francoist victims will assist Spaniards in resolving their complicated past. For many families of LGBT people, identifying remains is important because it is all they have of their family member. They do not have any larger legacy. Lesbian stories are harder to find as gay men had much more visibility as a result of more brutal punishment by the Franco regime. Lesbians, benefiting from lower visibility as a means to avoid repression, have a much harder history to document in the Civil War period. According to documentary film maker Andrea Weiss, historical memory requires people first know stories about people before they can be remembered. While broad strokes are known, many of the individual stories are lost or forgotten so they cannot be remembered. It makes it impossible to understand the level of suffering endured by Spain's LGBT community during the Civil War. == Footnotes == == References == Category:Lesbian culture in Europe Category:LGBT rights in Spain Category:Women in Francoist Spain Category:Women in the Spanish transition to democracy Category:Lesbian history in Spain ","title":"Lesbians in Francoist Spain"},{"id":"60283366","text":"Jennifer Soto (born May 5, 1996) is a goofy-footed American skateboarder from Jersey City, New Jersey. ==Skateboarding== Soto started skating in 6th grade.

The only known species is A. schweitzerae. The holotype fossil of the bird was found in the Xiagou Formation, and is noted as the first discovered fossil bird with an unlaid egg. Abnormalities, including egg binding in which the egg becomes stuck within the body of the bird causing death, were found in the egg suggesting that the preserved egg may have caused this bird's demise. Egg binding is a serious and lethal condition that is fairly common in small birds undergoing stress. According to paleontologist Jasmina Wiemann of Yale University, “This is a spectacular fossil with a lot of potential for future paleobiological investigations.\\" Further, \\"This new specimen is arguably one of the most interesting Cretaceous fossil birds yet discovered, providing more reproductive information than any other Mesozoic fossil bird,\\" according to a paleontology researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. == Discovery and naming == In 2006, at Changma in Gansu the skeleton was found of an enantiornithean bird. In several studies it was referred to with its field number DCAGS-IG-06-CM-012 or FDRC-06-CM-012. In 2019, the type species Avimaia schweitzerae was named and described by Alida M. Bailleul, Jingmai Kathleen O’Connor, Zhang Shukang, Li Zhiheng, Wang Qiang, Matthew C. Lamanna, Zhu Xufeng and Zhou Zhonghe. The generic name is a combination of the Latin avis, \\"bird\\", and Maia, a mother goddess, in reference to the find of an egg in the abdomen of the fossil. The specific name honours Mary Higby Schweitzer, one of the founders of the application of molecular biology in paleontology. The holotype, IVPP V25371, was found in a layer of the lower-middle Xiagou Formation. It consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull, compressed on a single plate. It conserves the rear half of the body. It is articulated and visible from the underside. Parts of the plumage and an egg are preserved. A second specimen, CAGS-IG-04-CM-007, was referred to the species. It is a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It is not articulated and preserves parts of the pelvis and the hindlimbs. == Description == Avimaia is a relatively small member of the Enantiornithes. The describing authors found two distinguishing traits. They are autapomorphies, unique derived characters. The pubic bone has a slender build and is curved upwards, causing a hollow profile over the entire length of its rear edge. The rear end of the ischium is curved to above. In several additional traits Avimaia differs from some relatives. The sacrum consists of eight sacral vertebrae. The first metatarsal is J-shaped with its diverging lower end having two thirds of the length of the shaft, which is a relatively low ratio. ===Egg=== Between the pubic bones of the fossil, a flattened egg is present, running from the last back vertebra to the front of the pygostyle, the fused outer tail vertebrae. It covers a surface of 5.2 cm². It is the first time a fossil bird egg has been discovered within the abdomen of the female. The egg is not merely an outline of organic remains: the egg shells themselves have been preserved, which is again unique. The combined shells have a thickness of 0.2 to 0.4 millimetres. A section showed the presence of four to six separate shells stacked on top of each other, each about 0.05 millimetres thick. Each shell consists of three layers, as with modern birds and generally in derived dinosaur eggs. There is an inner mammillary layer, an intermediate prismatic layer and an outer crystalline layer. The three layers combined are rather thin: earlier reported shells of Enantiornithes are thicker. Another anomaly consists in the fact that the prismatic layer and outer layer combined are thinner than the mammillary layer, whereas normally the opposite is true. On the surface of the egg a brown organic layer is visible, which was identified as the cuticle. In the cuticle nanospheres of calcium phosphate were discovered, which are also present in the cuticle of some extant birds. Additionally, remains were identified of the egg membrane, the membrana testacea. The fibres of the membrane are individually visible and have a length of 1.5 to 4 micrometres. They possibly contain part of the original proteins. It is likely that during fossilisation, the egg shells shifted in relation to each other and were otherwise distorted. The presence of four to six shells on top of each other is difficult to explain. The authors considered the possibility that the shells represented two eggs, but this hypothesis was rejected. In case of two eggs, the two top shells should have mirrored each other, as they then should have been the opposite shells of a top egg. In reality, they mirror the lower shells. Furthermore, it is generally assumed that the Eumaniraptora only have one functional oviduct. It was concluded that the stacking was caused by a pathology, egg binding, which is not uncommon among some modern bird species, such as the chicken, and can be caused by stress. Retention of the egg in the oviduct would have led to the deposition of multiple shells on a single egg. Such a condition is potentially fatal and it was suggested that it led to the demise of the holotype individual. ===Medullary bone=== In the thighbone, section showed that an inner layer of medullary bone was present around the medullary cavity. Such a medullary bone is used by modern bird females to extract chalk from during the laying of eggs. Its presence thus confirms that the holotype is a female and the structure in its abdomen is indeed an egg. ===Plumage=== What little of the plumage has been preserved, seems to indicate that long tail feathers were absent. It has been suggested that in the Enantiornithes such long display feathers were limited to the males only, as an instance of sexual dimorphism. Their absence thus is a further corroboration of the hypothesis that the type specimen is female. ==Phylogeny== Avimaia was placed in the Enantiornithes in 2019. A cladistic analysis indicated a derived position in that clade, in a polytomy with Neuquenornis, Enantiophoenix, Concornis and Eoenantiornis. == Gallery == Simplified phylogeny - hypothetical evolutionary stages - modern avian reproduction == References == Category:Enantiornithes Category:Aptian life Category:Early Cretaceous birds of Asia Category:Fossils of China Category:Fossil taxa described in 2019 ","title":"Avimaia"},{"id":"60283401","text":"Gardella is a surname.

As a member of the Indian National Congress (1918 – 1966) and of the Constituent Assembly, he was a significant contributor to the debates and issues that chartered the course of the Indian independence. Apart from being one of the foremost leaders of the Congress in Bihar, his association with the All India Hindu Mahasabha (becoming its General Secretary at its Calcutta session in 1926) makes him a very important figure of India’s nationalist history. == Early LifeExcerpts from, Varma, Pratima (Seema Press, 2004). Bihar ki Ananya VibhutiI: Translated by Chandra, Rajshree == Jagat Narain Lal was born on 21 July 1894 in a small mofussil town called Akhgaon in the district of Arrah, Bihar. His father, Bhagawat Prasad, had a railway job as a station master, whose transferable job took him to many places. His mother, Radhika Devi, was a homemaker and a great Kirshna bhakt. The inspiration of his mother’s bhakti and the enchantment of the metaphysical formed the core of Jagat Narain Lal’s religiosity, but also his politics. He received elementary education, like many other children of those times, by a maulvi who used to come home. Jagat Narain Lal joined a formal school only much later in Gorakhpur where his father, Bhagwat Prasad, had been posted. In 1910, for higher studies he first joined the very reputed, and a more cosmopolitan, Irwin Christian College, and then, after graduating with a first division, moved to the Allahabad University for his post graduate studies in economics and law. In 1918, Lal moved to Patna where he began his practise in the Patna High Court in the august company of Sir Ali Imam, Syed Hasan Imam, Sachidanand Sinha, Sri Baidyanath Singh, and above all Dr. Rajendra Prasad. Under their mentorship Jagat Narain Lal soon began to make a name for himself. But just as he was beginning to make a name for himself professionally, he was sucked into the the national movement. The nation woke up to the efficacy and immense possibilities of a form of resistance that was a combination of extra- constitutional struggle as well as of moral force against an adversary that has both the rule of law and might on its side. Almost all prominent leaders of Bihar - Brajkishore Prasand, Rajendra Prasad, Muzharul Haq – participated in the movement. == Intellectual Life == Jagat Narain Lal was a very learned man with a wide-ranging interest in Vedantic philosophy, Western political philosophy, economics and matters of law. He was a professor of economics at Bihar Vidyapith (inaugurated by Gandhi on 4 Feb 1921), a practising lawyer, editor of journal Mahavir (till 1928), a writer who wrote extensively about his political life and spiritual awakening. The Nehru Memorial Library has more than two thousand hand written pages that record his wide intellectual interests and repertoireJagat Narain Lal Papers: Correspondence, Notebooks, Dairies, Speeches and Writings by Him, Nehru Memorial Museum & Library. http://nehrumemorial.nic.in/images/pdf/individual_pdfs/list_of_the_papers_of_jagat_narain_lal_1384344370.pdf. In a book recounting his jail years, Light Unto a Cell. he references the Mahabharat, the Bhagwat Gita, Isha Upanishad, among others. There’s an interesting anecdote in the book, he writes: \\"Along with my old friend, Narayan Prasad Sinha, MLA with whom I had first started the study of the Gita and the Upanishads in 1921, I wanted to form a study circle of lovers of the Gita. But, so nervous were most of the Gandhites and Congressmen of anti- religious bias of our socialist and communist fellow prisoners that they had hardly the courage to broach the matter openly.’ == Political life == As a committed freedom fighter and Congressman, Jagat Narain lal was imprisoned during the Non Cooperation, Civil Disobedience and the Quit India Movements and spent close to a decade in jail. As the assistant secretary of the Provincial Congress Committee He played a major role in the success of the Gaya Congress in 1922 after his release from Buxer jail. He was sentenced to prison for a second time in 1929 under the charges of sedition for having become, as he writes, ‘the bête noir to the Government and the police chief of the province, thanks to my bitter and scathing criticism of their bungling which had resulted in communal antagonism and riots.’ After he was released from Hazaribagh Central jail in 1929, he lent his support to and spearheaded the Salt Satyagraha as the President of the Patna District Congress Committee. In the interim, Lal, under the influence of Madan Mohan Malviya and B.S. Moonje, also acquired dual membership of the Hindu Mahasabha. His association with the All India Hindu Mahasabha strengthened and he became its General Secretary at its Calcutta session in 1926. Beginning early 1930s, his enchantment with the Hindu Mahasabha began to wane. On his release from Hazaribagh Central Jail in 1932, he joined the Servants of Hindu Society. He wrote: ‘[When] Bhai Paramanand was elected president of the Hindu Mahasabha, he openly advocated a pro-government and anti-Congress policy, in defiance of all earlier traditions. The rift between us grew wider and wider until…I felt I could no longer associated with him.’ In protest, and to register his disenchantment, Jagat Narain Lal finally stopped taking his allowance from the Mahasabha. His disenchantment with the Hindu Mahasabha was complete by the time the first provincial assembly elections took place in 1937 when he fought the elections on a Congress ticket defeated the Mahasabha candidate who stood against him. ‘The election was almost a cake-walk for me. The Hindu Sabha candidate forfeited his deposit.’.In 1937, he became the Parliamentary secretary to the then https://books.google.co.in/books?id=0iVHBAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA118&dq;=parliamentary+secretary+Jagat+Narayan+Lal&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwi106GB0IHpAhUtILcAHQIoACkQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q;=parliamentary%20secretary%20Jagat%20Narayan%20Lal&f;=false Finance Minister of Bihar province Dr.Anugraha Narayan Sinha. At the Congress session at Allahabad in 1942 he moved a resolution with Nehru’s backing and support – famously known as the Jagat Narain lal’s Resolution– rejecting Sir Stafford Cripp’s interim proposal for a Dominion Status and Partition of India, and defeating C. Rajagopalachari’s resolution in support of the Cripps’ proposals. Jagat Narain Lal went on to become a member of the Constituent Assembly as a Congress representative from Bihar. He made several important interventions regarding the right to religion, on matters pertaining to the federal structure and nature of citizenship in the constituent Assembly Debates. He was also appointed as a member of the Dar Commission, 1948 – (a three member commission) – which was the first linguistic reorganization commission of India. He went on to become a member of the legislative assembly from the Danapur constituency, and the Deputy Speaker of the Bihar state assembly led by Chief Minister Krishna Sinha and a cabinet minister in 1957, handling the portfolios of Law, and Cooperative and Animal husbandry. == References == Category:1894 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Indian independence activists from Bihar ","title":"Jagat Narain Lal"},{"id":"60283586","text":"Dominioni is a surname.

He survived the war, despite spending most of it in the Buchenwald concentration camp, followed by two years in a punishment battalion sent to support the war effort on the Russian front. After 1945 he became a mainstream Social Democratic politician, eventually serving between 1970 and his death in 1978 as a President of the National Council (\\"Nationalratspräsident\\"). ==Biography== ===Provenance and early years=== Otto Probst was born in the Favoriten quarter of Vienna. Urban Probst, his father, was a carter/courier originally from the Lavant Valley in eastern Carinthia. His mother, born Maria Szerenczi, was from Rechnitz on the Austria-Hungary frontier. He joined the Young Socialists, still aged only 15, in 1926 and remained a member till 1934. From 1930 he was also a member of the Social Democratic Party. Otto Probst attended the \\"Further education college for graphic arts\\" (\\"Fortbildungsschule für das graphische Gewerbe\\") between 1926 and 1930. Between 1932 and 1934 he worked in the Youth Protection Office of the Vienna \\"Chamber of Labour\\" (\\"Arbeitskammer\\"), where he was involved in the \\"Youth in Need\\" and the \\"Youth at work\\" initiatives. A period of unemployment followed. ===Austrofascism=== Between 1934 and 1938 he was a member of the Austrian Revolutionary Socialists (\\"Revolutionäre Sozialisten Österreichs\\" / RS). Political activity on behalf of the (now banned) Socialist parties had been illegal since shortly before the short-lived insurrection in February 1934. Directly after the insurrection Probst found himself held for several days in political detention because he had been identified as a member of the national executive of the Young Socialists. Other leading roles in socialist organisations on a local level were also cited. There were further periods of political detention followed in 1935/36 and again, briefly, in 1937. In the long-remembered \\"Socialist [show] Trial\\" of 1936 he was one of the 30 people facing charges involving illegal political activism. but in the end he was set free for lack of evidence. ===Great Germany=== Following the largely peaceful invasion of Austria by Nazi Germany Probst was able to work, between 1938 and 1939, as a welder. Then in August 1939 he was caught up in a Gestapo wave of arrests targeting remaining Revolutionary Socialist activists, and transferred to the Buchenwald concentration camp where he was kept till 1943. That year he was placed in an army punishment battalion sent to support the war effort on the Russian front. ===Postwar politics=== The end of the war marked a return to democracy, and he played a leading part in re-establishing the party in the Favoriten quarter (Vienna 10th district), becoming the longstanding chairman of the local party. He became known, half jokingly, as the \\"Emperor of Favoriten\\" (der \\"Kaiser von Favoriten\\"). \\"Between 1946 and 1970 Otto Probst served as National Secretary (Zentralsekretär) of the Social Democratic Party. During that period he was also, between 19 December 1945 and 24 June 1970, a member of parliament (\\"Abgeordneter zum Nationalrat\\"). That covered ten parliamentary sessions, between the fifth and the fourteenth. ===Ministerial office and the Fußach Affair=== Between 27 March 1963 and the end of the \\"Grand Coalition\\" government on 19 April 1966, Otto Probst served under Chancellors Gorbach and Klaus as \\"Minister for Transport and Electricity Supply\\" (\\"Bundesminister für Verkehr und Elektrizitätswirtschaft\\"). His three year incumbency goes mostly unremarked in sources and was evidently largely uneventful. The exception was the \\"Fußach affair\\". Fußach is a small town on the shores of the Bodensee (\\"Lake Constance\\"), a large lake bordered by three different countries. The eastern shore is in the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, where historical memories remained powerful. Following the First World War a reconfigured (and much diminished) Austrian state emerged: there was a desire by many in Vorarlberg to join Switzerland.1982 edition of Encyclopædia Britannica, \\"History of Austria\\" In a referendum held in Vorarlberg on 11 May 1919, over 80% of those voting supported a proposal for the state to join the Swiss Confederation. However this was blocked by the opposition of the Austrian government, with support from the victorious powers. The Austrian Chancellor in 1919 was Karl Renner, a man widely celebrated, at least in Vienna, as the \\"Father of the Republic\\". He was still active at the heart of national politics after the Second World War, serving as President of Austria between 1945 and 1950. When Otto Probst, as Minister for Transport, was called upon to come up with a name for a new lake steamer for the Bodensee in 1964, it evidently made sense to name the boat after Karl Renner. It quickly became apparent that the idea made no sense at all for people in Vorarlberg. No lake steamer had been named after any individual since the creation of the republic in 1919, and personality cults of all types had been discredited by Adolf Hitler. The Vorarlberg regional government passed a resolution that the boat should be named \\"Vorarlberg\\". The national government in Vienna was unpersuaded. On 24 November 1964 thousands of demonstrators - one source states there were 20,000 - awaited the arrival of Otto Probst's special train at Bregenz station. When the special train arrived without its special ministerial passenger, the crowd made their way eight kilometer (five miles) along the lake shore to the little town of Fußach where the naming ceremony was to take place. As the minister approached by boat from Bregenz in order to preside at the naming ceremony, information came through that the call in the \\"Vorarlberger Nachrichten\\" (the local newspaper) for people to demonstrate against him had met with a far larger and more determined response than the authorities had anticipated. Tomatoes were thrown and barricades were over-run as the authorities struggled to rescue the guest of honour from contact with the demonstrators. In the end the naming ceremony involving the minister had to be deferred, although an impromptu naming ceremony did take place when one of the demonstrators clambered up beside the new lake steamer and scrawled the name \\"Vorarlberg\\" on the bow. A woman then completed the ceremony by smashing a bottle against the ship. (The bottle contained not sparkling wine but lake water, however.) Probst refused to back down, and more arguments about the naming of the lake steamer continued for half a year. Mindful, perhaps, of a banner carried by one of the protestors calling for \\"More democracy less personality cult\\" (\\"Mehr Demokratie weniger Personenkult\\"), he offered as a compromise the proposal that the next new lakesteamer should be called \\"Austria\\". On 3 April 1965 30,000 demonstrators turned up in the centre of Bregenz demanding the minister's resignation. It was only on 14 July 1965 that the Party executive were seen to soften their position, recommending to the minister that he should give the new lake steamer the name \\"Vorarlberg\\". A low-key - almost secret - naming ceremony for the \\"Vorarlberg\\" finally took place on 30 July 1965: the minister attended the ceremony. ===Final decade=== On 20 October 1970 he became a President of the National Council (\\"Nationalratspräsident\\"). He held the office till December 1978. He died suddenly in his office at the parliament. ==Notes== ==References== Category:1911 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Buchenwald concentration camp survivors Category:Presidents of the National Council (Austria) Category:Social Democratic Party of Austria politicians Category:Government ministers of Austria Category:Recipients of the Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria ","title":"Otto Probst"},{"id":"60283603","text":"The Online Pornography (Commercial Basis) Regulations 2019 is a statutory instrument issued under the powers given by the Digital Economy Act 2017.

In 1923, Souths reached the grand final against Eastern Suburbs. Lawrence played at lock in the 15–12 defeat which was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Lawrence finished 1923 as the club's top point scorer. In 1924, Souths again reached the grand final against rivals Balmain. Lawrence played at prop in the match which Souths lost 3-0 which was the lowest scoring grand final at the time. In 1925, Lawrence was part of the South Sydney side which went the entire season undefeated and won the premiership outright without needing to play in a grand final. Over the next few seasons, Lawrence played sporadically for Souths and did not play in the club's premiership victories between 1926 and 1928. Lawrence retired at the end of 1928 and played a total of 95 games for Souths across all grades.Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: The Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players.

Arnold Block was a commercial building located at 12-14 East State Street in Battle Creek, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It was demolished in 1988. ==History== Adam C. Arnold arrived in Battle Creek in 1857 with his wife, Marla Dygert Arnold. He first ran a wooden pump-manufacturing business, gaining the nickname \\"Pump.\\" After some time, he found that operating a hotel and saloon was more lucrative, and he ran the Arnold House (later renamed the Exchange Hotel). The hotel and saloon quickly acquired an unsavory reputation, as Arnold repeatedly violated the city's liquor control laws and allegedly bilked travelers out of their change. However, business was good, and in 1886 Arnold constructed the Arnold Block. The block originally contained a restaurant and saloon operated by Arnold's son George H. Arnold, in addition to A. C. Arnold's office and storage for pawned goods. Just as the Arnold House/Exchange Hotel had quickly acquired an unsavory reputation, the Arnold Block did likewise, with rumors of prostitutes and other shady characters. In 1895, George H. Arnold was found murdered, and Adam C. Arnold was eventually convicted of the crime. He appealed, and while released, died himself in 1897. By this time, much of Arnold's assets had been lost to legal fees, and the Arnold Block was in the possession of the City Bank of Battle Creek. In 1896, the \\"Arnold Mission\\" for men hunting work was established in the Arnold Block, with the bank donating free rent. Eventually the mission hosted a cheap lunch counter, free beds, and free baths. In subsequent years, the building housed a telephone company warehouse, a restaurant, a furniture store, billiard roan, barber shop, real estate office, cigar store, and office supply store warehouse. In the early 1980s, the building was refurbished to house an antique store, \\"Pump Arnold's Place.\\" In 1988, the building was demolished to make way for the headquarters of the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. ==Description== The Adam C. Arnold Block was a four-story Late Victorian red brick commercial block with a flat roof. It measured thirty feet wide and fifty-one feet deep on one side, and sixty-five deep on the other. The building had a facade with extensive ornamentation, including an iron cornice and iron storefront elements, stone window surrounds, and decorative tile. On the first floor, the storefront held a plate glass windows framed by galvanized iron architectural piers and lintels . To one side was a recessed entrance to the staircase leading to the upper floors. The store entrance was through wooden double doors with transom lights above. The second and third floors contained rock-faced window facings, lintels, and sills, above which were bands of sawtooth brickwork extending across the facade. On the fourth floor, more galvanized Iron trim surrounded the windows, as well as \\"bat-wing\\" and keystone trim between the windows. Above were the cornice with supporting brackets and frieze, also of galvanized iron. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calhoun County, Michigan Category:Victorian architecture in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1886 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1988 ","title":"Adam C.

K-268's western terminus is at U.S. Route 75 (US-75) and K-31 north of Lyndon, and the eastern terminus is at K-68 north of Quenemo. K-268 was first designated a state highway in 1962 to connect Pomona State Park to the State Highway System. ==Route description== K-268 begins at an intersection with US-75 and K-31 north of Lyndon and travels east for roughly and intersects Rural Secondary 1471 (RS-1471), which travels south to K-68. From here it continues east for roughly and intersects RS-262, which travels north to Pomona State Park. It continies east another and intersects K-368, a short spur that also travels north to the state park. From K-368 it continues east for another roughly and intersects South Pomona Dam Road, which crosses the dam of Pomona Lake. At this point it begins to curve to a southeast direction. It travels southeast for roughly then curves back east. It continues east for approximately and reaches its eastern terminus at K-68 north of Quenemo. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 2450 vehicles per day slightly west of the terminus with K-368 to 2910 vehicles per day near the western terminus. K-268 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-268 does connect to the National Highway System at its terminus with US-75. The entire route is paved with full design bituminous pavement. ==History== The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began to construct Pomona Dam and its associated reservoir in the early 1960s. The federal agency agreed to relocate several county highways that would be displaced by the reservoir, and the Kansas State Highway Commission requested a pair of those highways–an east–west highway between US-75 and K-68 and an access road to the recreational land around the reservoir—be constructed to state highway standards. Then in a November 14, 1962 resolution, K-268 was approved from US-75 to K-68 south of the lake. Also at this time, K-368 was approved as a short spur from K-268 to link it to the recreation area by the lake. The former western terminus was a four-way intersection, and from January 2004 to August 2009, there was a total of 24 crashes, which included one fatality and fifteen that resulted in injuries. Residents of the surrounding communities requested a \\"safer type of intersection\\", then in late Fall of 2013, work began to reconstruct the intersection as a roundabout. On November 17, 2014, the new roundabout at the eastern terminus opened to unrestricted traffic. The project was fully completed by the end of December. Smoky Hill LLC from Salina, was the primary contractor on the $2.541 million roundabout project. On August 9, 2018, a tractor-trailer travelling southbound on US-75 crashed into the roundabout. The trucks fuel tank was damaged and spilled about 70 gallons of diesel fuel. K-31 and US-75 traffic was reduced to one lane for about four hours after the crash. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Kansas Department of Transportation State Map *KDOT: Historic State Maps 268 Category:Transportation in Osage County, Kansas ","title":"K-268 (Kansas highway)"},{"id":"60283913","text":"Alioune Diakhate (born 10 April 1994) is a Senegalese professional footballer who plays for USL Championship club Indy Eleven. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Senegalese footballers Category:Indy Eleven players Category:USL Championship players Category:Senegalese expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Association football forwards ","title":"Alioune Diakhate"},{"id":"60283948","text":"The 16 members of the inaugural U.S.A Skateboarding National Team announced in March, will compete to qualify for Skateboarding at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games.

Shenker was born in the heyday of the American hazzan. He became interested in the art as a child, and was performing on radio by his early teens. Soon after, he became close to Rabbi Shaul Taub, the Holocaust-surviving Modzitz Grand Rabbi, who was known for his mystical Hasidic compositions. He dedicated much of his life to recording and publishing the large stock of pre-war Modzitz songs, as well as Taub's post-war work. Shenker created a music label, Neginah, for the purpose of recording those songs, and himself became a composer of hundreds Modzitz moded songs. == Early life == Shenker's parents were Mordechai and Miriam Shenker, Polish hasidim who came to America about 1921. Their son was born four years later, and they raised him in Williamsburg. He had two brothers and a sister: Chaim Baruch, Nachman, and Rose. Even as a child, he showed interest in cantorial music, preferring to listen to greats such as Yossele Rosenblatt rather than play with toys. Joshua Samuel Weisser (originally Pilderwasser), known as the leading New York cantor of the 1930s, took Shenker into his choir at age 12. Weisser had a Yiddish-language radio program at the time, and Shenker was a soloist on it, with his own 15-minute weekly segment. In performance, mostly during prayers, he was described as having a reedy tenor and perfect pitch. Shenker also studied with teacher and conductor Seymour Silbermintz. He attended Yeshiva Torah Vodaath, where he received weekly leave to go to the radio studio for his show, so long as he returned in time for the next study session. He recorded an album at age 13. When he was about 14 or 15 he visited Rabbi Shaul Taub's house. Taub was the leader of the Modzitz Hasidim, who were known for their often lengthy and sophisticated musical compositions. While there, the young Shenker sight-read some of Taub's sheet music, which surprised Taub, who asked him to serve as a music secretary. Part of Shenker's job was to write musical notation for Taub, including early drafts of unrecorded compositions. == Adulthood == Shenker continued his studies in Yeshiva Torah Vodaath, and was ordained a rabbi. He married Dina Lustig, a Cincinnati native, in the late 1940s. === Music preservation === He started the Neginah label in 1956. The name is Hebrew for \\"playing of music.\\" For its first album, Shenker trained a choir at the residence of the Bessers in Manhattan, former members of the congregation in Crown Heights. The selections consisted of devotional songs for the Saturday night meal known as Melave Malka. Neginah eventually recorded a total of ten albums, including the most important songs in the traditional Modzitz repertoire, as well as Rabbi Taub's later works and many of Shenker's own 500-plus compositions. However, the main purpose was to record the legacy, over which Shenker was very concerned. Once, he became upset when he heard a rendition of an early Modzitz tune that he felt had become distorted; he felt the producers \\"had a lot of nerve\\" to make such changes. The Neginah catalog inspired other hasidic sects to similarly record their own musical history. Shenker's personal tape library of over 600 cassettes and reel is held at the Institute for Preservation and Documentation of Modzitz Music Though Hasidic songs starting in the late 20th century began to absorb American popular music styles, Shenker's songs are fully rooted in ancient Hasidic tradition, and show little American influence. On the other hand, his influence extended outwards, to the Klezmer scene (a secular Jewish form of Jazz), and to recordings by Itzhak Perlman, Andy Statman, and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. He was known as the leading composer of music across the Hasidic spectrum. === Career and artistry === Velvel Pasternak, a Jewish music producer and historian, described Shenker's own melodies as \\"singable\\" by the masses. Many of Shenker's songs have become so much a part of the fabric of Ashkenazic Jewish Orthodox life that they are erroneously thought to be much older songs whose authorship is unknown. Shenker, a humble man, did not mind the anonymity, and was typically surprised when approached as a celebrity. Two songs in particular became global Sabbath meal standards (even in Sephardic homes, unusual for Ashkenazi material): Eishes Chayil (1946) on Friday nights, and variations of his Mizmor LeDovid (1953) on Saturday afternoons. His Yossis Alayich (1965) is also the most commonly used song for Jewish weddings, typically used as the opening song to the first dance at Orthodox weddings throughout the world. Hankus Netsky compared the Modzitz music to symphonies, and stated that Shenker treated them with appropriate gravitas. Statman described the melodies as powerful enough to purify and to reach the stars, and Shenker's mastery of music color and ornamentation as incredible. Shenker was the primary cantor at the Modzitz synagogue in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and later in Midwood, Brooklyn. In the 1980s, he left the established Modzitz synagogue to form a second one, also in Midwood. He regularly composed new songs each year for the High Holidays. He was the rabbi of that synagogue until his death on November 20, 2016 of heart disease. He continued to record music until the last days of his life. Shenker did not make a living from music, rarely collecting royalties. His family owned a sweater manufacturing business, and he was partner in a diamond dealership. == Legacy == For his shloshim (ritual event on the 30th day of passing), Cantor Chaim Dovid Berson of New York's Jewish Center and musicians Shim Craimer and Yitzy Spinner performed some of Shenker's work. He had three daughters: Esther Reifman, Adele Newmark, and Brocha Weinberger. When he died, he had 24 grandchildren and 90 great-grandchildren. Shenker was a prolific artist, with his voice and compositions appearing on dozens of albums. ==References== Category:American composers Category:Jewish composers Category:1925 births Category:2016 deaths Category:American Orthodox rabbis Category:Hazzans ","title":"Ben Zion Shenker"},{"id":"60283974","text":"The Moto Z3 (stylized as Moto z³ by Motorola and not to be confused with the Moto Z3 Play) is an Android smartphone developed by Motorola Mobility, as the successor to the Moto Z2 Force Edition.

Mods are case-like accessories that are attached to the rear of the Moto Z via a series of magnets. Using the pogo pin connectors, Mods can communicate with the device to provide additional functionality. Mods are hot swappable, and are automatically detected by the operating system software once installed. Motorola provides a relatively wide array of these \\"Moto Mods\\" in various departments such as photography and entertainment. However, there are reports that indicated Motorola's diminished interest in its MotoMods modular concept, which was initially expected to give the flagship Motorola phones edge in a highly competitive Android market. This is attributed to a recent move on the part of the company to scale back on its partnership with third-party MotoMod makers. The company also confirmed previously reported layoffs, which was acknowledged to have affected less than two percent of its global workforce. == Reception == TechRadar noted the phone's \\"stylish design\\" and primarily its 5G up-gradable feature.

The first is one of the variants of the free radical theory of aging. It was formulated by J. Michel in 1980 and was developed in the works of A. V. Linnan (1989). The second was proposed by A. N. Lobachev in 1978. Lobachev A.N. Mitochondrial free radical theory of aging, MFRTA, proposes that free radicals produced by mitochondrial activity damage cellular components, leading to aging. Free radicals damage mitochondria, which according to the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging, leads to ageing Mitochondria are cell organelles which function to provide the cell with energy by producing ATP (adenosine triphosphate). During ATP production electrons can escape the mitochondrion and react with water, producing reactive oxygen species, ROS for short. ROS can damage macromolecules, including lipids, proteins and DNA, which is thought to facilitate the process of ageing. Electron Transport Chain in the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane In the 1950s Denham Harman proposed the free radical theory of ageing, which he later expanded to the MFRTA. When studying the mutations in antioxidants, which remove ROS, results were inconsistent. However, it has been observed that overexpression of antioxidant enzymes in yeast, worms, flies and mice were shown to increase lifespan. ==Molecular basis== Molecular contributors to ageing (Reactive Oxygen Species, Mitochondrial Unfolded Protein Response, Mitochondrial Metabolites, Damage- Associated Molecular Patterns, Mitochondrial-derived Peptides, Mitochondrial Membrane) Mitochondria are thought to be organelles that developed from endocytosed bacteria which learned to coexist inside ancient cells. These bacteria maintained their own DNA, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which codes for components of the electron transport chain (ETC). The ETC is found in the inner mitochondrial membrane and functions to produce energy in the form of ATP molecules. The process is called oxidative phosphorylation, because ATP is produced from ADP in a series of redox reactions. Electrons are transferred through the ETC from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen, reducing oxygen to water. ===ROS=== Reactive Oxygen Species and oxygen ROS are highly reactive, oxygen- containing chemical species, which include superoxide, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical. If the complexes of the ETC do not function properly, electrons can leak and react with water, forming ROS. Normally leakage is low and ROS is kept at physiological levels, fulfilling roles in signaling and homeostasis. In fact, their presence at low levels lead to increased life span, by activating transcription factors and metabolic pathways involved in longevity. At increased levels ROS cause oxidative damage by oxidizing macromolecules, such as lipids, proteins and DNA. This oxidative damage to macromolecules is thought to be the cause of ageing. Mitochondrial DNA is especially susceptible to oxidative damage, due to its proximity to the site of production of these species. Damaging of mitochondrial DNA causes mutations, leading to production of ETC complexes, which don’t function properly, increasing ROS production, increasing oxidative damage to macromolecules. ===UPRmt=== The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is turned on in response to mitochondrial stress. Mitochondrial stress occurs when the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane is dissipated, mtDNA is mutated, and/or ROS accumulates, which can lead to misfolding and reduced function of mitochondrial proteins. Stress is sensed by the nucleus, where chaperones and proteases are upregulated, which can correct folding or remove damaged proteins, respectively. Decrease in protease levels are associated with ageing, as mitochondrial stress will remain, maintaining high ROS levels. Such mitochondrial stress and dysfunction has been linked to various age-associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, and type-2 diabetes. ===Mitochondrial metabolites=== As the mitochondrial matrix is where the TCA cycle takes place, different metabolites are commonly confined to the mitochondria. Upon ageing, mitochondrial function declines, allowing escape of these metabolites, which can induce epigenetic changes, associated with ageing. TCA cycle Acetyl-coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA) enters the TCA cycle in the mitochondrial matrix, and is oxidized in the process of energy production. Upon escaping the mitochondria and entering the nucleus, it can act as a substrate for histone acetylation. Histone acetylation is an epigenetic modification, which leads to gene activation. At a young age, acetyl-CoA levels are higher in the nucleus and cytosol, and its transport to the nucleus can extend lifespan in worms. Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD+) is produced in the mitochondria and upon escaping to the nucleus, can act as a substrate for sirtuins. Sirtuins are family of proteins, known to play a role in longevity. Cellular NAD+ levels have been shown to decrease with age. ===DAMPs=== Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are molecules that are released during cell stress. Mitochondrial DNA is a DAMP, which only becomes available during mitochondrial damage. Blood mitochondrial DNA levels become elevated with age, contributing to inflamm-aging, a chronic state of inflammation characteristic of advanced age. ===Mitochondrial-derived peptides=== Mitochondrial DNA has been known to encode 13 proteins. Recently, other short protein coding sequences have been identified, and their products are referred to as mitochondria-derived peptides. The mitochondrial-derived peptide, humanin has been shown to protect against Alzheimer’s disease, which is considered an age-associated disease. MOTS-c has been shown to prevent age- associated insulin resistance, the main cause of type 2 diabetes. Humanin and MOTS-c levels have been shown to decline with age, and their activity seems to increase longevity. ===Mitochondrial membrane=== Almaida-Pagan and coworkers found that mitochondrial membrane lipid composition changes with age, when studying Turquoise killifish. The proportion of monosaturated fatty acids decreased with age, and the proportion of polysaturated fatty acids increased. The overall phospholipid content also decreased with age. ==History== In 1956 Denham Harman first postulated the free radical theory of ageing, which he later modified to the mitochondrial free radical theory of ageing (MFRTA). He found ROS as the main cause of damage to macromolecules, known as “ageing”. He later modified his theory because he found that mitochondria were producing and being damaged by ROS, leading him to the conclusion that mitochondria determine ageing. In 1972, he published his theory in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. ==Evidence== It has been observed that with age, mitochondrial function declines and mitochondrial DNA mutation increases in tissue cells in an age-dependent manner. This leads to increase in ROS production and potential decrease in the cell’s ability to remove ROS. Most long-living animals have been shown to be more resistant to oxidative damage and have lower ROS production, linking ROS levels to lifespan. Overexpression of antioxidants, which function to remove ROS has also been shown to increase lifespan. Bioinformatics analysis showed that amino acid composition of mitochondrial proteins correlate with longevity (long-living species are depleted in cysteine and methionine), linking mitochondria to the process of ageing. By studying expression of certain genes in C. elegans, Drosophila, and mice it was found that disruption of ETC complexes can extend life – linking mitochondrial function to the process of ageing. Evidence supporting the theory started to crumble in the early 2000s. Mice with reduced expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant, SOD2, accumulated oxidative damage and developed cancer, but did not live longer than normal life. Overexpression of antioxidants reduced cellular stress, but did not increase mouse life span. The naked mole-rat, which lives 10-times longer than normal mice, has been shown to have higher levels of oxidative damage. ==See also== *Aging *Calorie Restriction *Denham Harman *Free radical theory of aging *Gerontology == References == Category:Ageing ","title":"Mitochondrial theory of ageing"},{"id":"60284000","text":"Battling Orioles is a 1924 American silent comedy film directed by Fred Guiol and Ted Wilde and starring Glenn Tryon, Blanche Mehaffey and John T.

After his retirement in 1889, Green was promoted to the rank of brevet general in recognition of his 43 years of distinguished service. Green fought in the Mexican–American War, the American Civil War, and in many battles during the westward expansion of the United States. He received the Medal of Honor for bravery in the First Battle of the Stronghold in 1873. Green first assumed command of Fort Boise in 1877. In 1879 he was given command of Fort Walla Walla. During the 1880s Green shuttled between Boise and Walla Walla, alternating his command between the two forts. Green retired in 1889 and settled in Boise, although during his last ten years he resided in Germany and returned to Boise for extended visits. He died in Boise in 1908.

Letterlocking is the securing of a letter without an envelope using folding and cutting. The process of letterlocking dates to the 13th century in Western history, corresponding with the availability of flexible writing paper. Letterlocking uses small slits, tab, and holes placed directly in to a letter, which combined with folding techniques are used to secure the letter, preventing reading the letter without breaking seals or slips, providing a means of tamper resistance. These folds and holes may be additionally secured with string and sealing wax. Intricate letterlocking works contain artistic elements, demonstrating more than a utilitarian purpose. While the use of sealing techniques may have been limited to ecclesiastic and the nobility, letterlocking was historically performed by all classes of writers. An individual could also be recognised by their personal technique of folding, as was the case with Jane Whorwood, of whose letter Charles I, imprisoned in Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of WIght, wrote “This Note [...] I know, by the fowldings [...] that it is written by [Mrs Whorwood]“.

Hodder served in the Royal Air Force from 1925 until his death in 1943 during the Second World War. During his athletic career, he played for the Royal Air Force cricket team and rugby union for London Irish. ==Early life and military career== The son of Samuel and Maud Hodder, he was born at Ringabella House in Carrigaline, Ireland. He was educated in England at Forest Hill House School, where he played for the school cricket team. On one occasion while playing for the school he scored a century and took all ten wickets. After leaving Forest Hill, he took up employment with Midland Bank. However, he became dissatisfied with his job, instead enlisting with the Royal Air Force as a pilot officer in 1925. He was promoted to the rank of flying officer in January 1927. Three years later he was promoted to the rank of flight lieutenant in November 1930. Hodder played first-class cricket for the Royal Air Force cricket team against the Army at The Oval in 1931. Batting twice in the match, Hodder was ended the Royal Air Force first-innings unbeaten having scored a single run, while in their second-innings he remained unbeaten on 10. With his right-arm bowling, he bowled a total of 28 overs across the match, conceding 69 runs and taking the wicket of Bill Leggatt. He also played rugby union, playing for London Irish for ten seasons, as well as representing Kent in the County Championship. He also trialled for Ireland, but was not successful in being selected to play. During the 1930s he served in Iraq and Aden, as well as passing a specialist engineering course. He was promoted to the rank of squadron leader in February 1937. He married Evelyn Margaret Bowden-Smith in early 1940, with the couple having two sons. ==WWII service and death== He served during the Second World War and was stationed in France at its outbreak, later working alongside the Advanced Air Striking Force to cover the retreating British Expeditionary Force during the Battle of France, for which he was mentioned in dispatches. After the allied defeat in France, Hodder returned home and was placed on engineering duties, firstly at Rootes Aircraft Factory and later at Handley Page. He was promoted to the temporary rank of group captain in March 1942, with Hodder obtaining the full rank the following month. In July 1943, he was placed in command of RAF Syerston. Having had little flying experience, Hodder wanted to experience what his men experienced during bombing raids.

Preap, No. 16-1363, 586 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case related to the detention of legal immigrants with criminal histories. In a 5–4 vote, the Court ruled that the government has the power to detain immigrants at any time that have committed certain crimes that could lead to their deportation, even if those crimes occurred long in the past. ==Background== The case centers on the language of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, codified at , which states that an immigrant \\"shall be taken into custody\\" if they have committed a deportable offense, when that alien is \\"released\\". In the specific case, the respondents were legal immigrants in California that had been convicted of criminal charges, each which fell into the class that could lead to deportation, and served their time. They were not detained at their release from serving this criminal sentence, but instead were detained by immigration officials five to eleven years later after being released for serving time on non-criminal charges. With help from the American Civil Liberties Union, the three sued the Department of Homeland Security, arguing that because they were not immediately detained on release from the criminal sentence, Sect. 1226 did not apply to them. The District Court certified their case as a class-action case, represented all immigrants in similar situations, and found for the immigrants, ruling that they could not be held under Section 1226 due to lack of immediate detention. The Ninth Circuit upheld the ruling on appeal. A similar separate class-action case was made in Washington state, under Khoury v. Asher, where both the District and Ninth Circuit reached the same conclusion, that the immigrants could not be detained since they were not detained immediately after release from the criminal offense.Khoury v. Asher, 3 F. Supp. 3d 877 (W.D. Wash. 2014); affirmed, ==Supreme Court== The Department of Homeland Security petitioned their case to the Supreme Court, who granted certiorari to hear the challenge on both cases, citing that the Ninth Circuit's decision had created a split on the matter among the circuit courts. Oral arguments were heard on October 10, 2018. The decision was released on March 19, 2019. In the 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's two rulings and stated that the language of Section 1226 allowed detention at any time after the deportable offense. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, stated that Congress enacted mandatory detention out of concern that individualized hearings could not be trusted to reveal which deportable criminal aliens who are not detained might continue to engage in crime or fail to appear for their removal hearings, and that allowing for detention long after release reflected the fact that immigration officials are not always notified or available in a timely manner to be at the point of release. Those delays may be caused by unintentional delays, or in some cases, purposely not notified as in the case of some sanctuary cities. However, Alito did acknowledge that this interpretation would end up targeting a wider range of immigrants, including those that have only had minor infractions such as drug offenders and tax cheats, but was necessary to serve the purpose of the law as written by Congress. The other four justices on the conservative wing joined on the majority, though Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote his own opinion that concurred in part to Alito's, while Justice Clarence Thomas also wrote a concurrence in part, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch. The dissenting opinion was delivered by Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by the other three liberal Justices. Breyer cautioned that the majority opinion gave the government a new wide-ranging power; \\"It is a power to detain persons who committed a minor crime many years before, and it is a power to hold those persons, perhaps for many months, without any opportunity to obtain bail.\\" The decision of the Supreme Court was noted to be the second within the last few years to support a strong government stance on immigration, following Trump v. Hawaii (Docket 17-965). ==ReferencesNielsen v.

She earned a doctorate in science and a research position at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, to work at the Western Brain and Mind Institute with neuroscientist Adrian Owen. She married a Canadian scientist with whom she works. In 2017, she won an International Talent Award for the L'Oréal-UNESCO For Women in Science program. Lorina Naci joined the Global Brain Health Institute in Dublin in 2017 and became assistant professor of psychology at Trinity College Dublin. ==Works== In 2013, she and Adrian Owen developed a method for communicating with patients in a persistent vegetative state. A patient with this condition was located within a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner, and neuro- imagery was used perceived to amount to answers to several simple yes/no questions. In 2014, through a second method, the Canadian team also screened a film by Alfred Hitchcock to a group of healthy volunteers and two patients in coma. Then, by analyzing the cerebral activity of both by functional MRI, the team found that the brain of one of the coma patients, a young man, reacted to the film much as did a healthy person; on the other hand, no activity was found in the brain of the other patient, a young woman. Owen and Naci's work has attracted international attention from the world's media; it was reported in many hundreds of newspapers around the world (including twice on the front page of the New York Times and other quality journals) and has been widely discussed on television (e.g. BBC News, Channel 4 News, ITN News, Sky News, CNN), radio (e.g. BBC World Service) 'Outlook' documentary, NPR Radio (USA), BBC Radio 1, 2, 3 and 4), in print (e.g. full featured articles in The New Yorker The Times, The Sunday Times, The Observer Magazine etc.) and online (including Nature, Science and The Guardian podcasts).

The increase in social movements can be attributed to the rise of globalization, increased flows of migratory workers, and issues arising from the neoliberal management of workers. Repeated complaints and demands by pro-labor movements typically revolving around issues such as minimum wage and insurance coverage can be seen. These demands usually move away from a narrative of labor disputes and begin to encompass a human-rights perspective. How these social movements manifest depends on the level of restrictions and autonomy given workers by employers and foreign governments. Although Hong Kong allows demonstrations and NGOs, the Middle East continues to outlaw such practices. This has led some workers to alternative forms of resistance. Protesting outside one's home country is a relatively-new phenomenon, and scholars have noted that the potential to protest relies on a quasi-stateless nature. Although foreign domestic workers receive visas to live and work temporarily in their host country, they rarely become citizens or permanent residents of their country of employment. ==East Asia== ===Hong Kong=== Hong Kong is a major East Asian metropolis with industry, trade, and economic freedoms fueling its development. Because of a local, highly-skilled labor force, there has been an influx of migrant domestic workers to the Chinese special administrative region since it left British control. These workers were initially mainly Filipino, but Indonesians currently make up about half; workers from Nepal, Thailand, and Malaysia are a small minority. Because of the large number of foreign domestic workers and Hong Kong's democratic stances on freedom of speech and assembly, the region has become a center of protests. Hundreds of NGOs and labor unions have formed partnerships with international human-rights and labor organizations, such as Migrant International (in the Philippines) and the International Labour Organization (ILO). ===Singapore=== Although foreign domestic workers have been common in Singapore since before the state's independence, the number of protests is significantly less than in Hong Kong. Foreign construction workers (predominantly male) have mobilized and improved their situation in similar issues, such as unfair wages. Singapore has had a mixed history with its foreign domestic-worker policy. Migration was restricted during the early post-independence era, but was later promoted (and subsidized) by the government to influence Singaporean women to take skilled-labor jobs. Cases of mistreatment of foreign domestic workers exist, but they afford some benefits and protections (such as the 1997 Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, which requires employers to purchase a $10,000 accident-insurance policy). ==Middle East== The Middle East is an area of concern about the welfare of foreign domestic workers, who generally lack freedom of mobility and other rights. Under the Kafala system in many Middle Eastern countries, workers have been physically abused, overly controlled, and isolated. ===Lebanon=== Foreign domestic workers in Lebanon, which uses the Kafala system, are primarily from Africa, Sri Lanka, India, and the Philippines. Because of Lebanon's strict laws about freedom of assembly and the illegality of unions and NGOs, it is difficult for workers to protest publicly. Instead, they go against their employers' and the state's wishes to increase their autonomy. Nominal or non- Christians ask employers for Sunday off to attend church, where they socialize, disseminate information, and gain a better understanding of how to improve their situation. Those with less freedom have balcony talks. Since Lebanon has many tall, residential buildings with small balconies, workers use the balconies as a refuge where they can talk with others about the same subjects as in a church setting. Some workers consider the balconies their own space, which is minimally monitored by employers. ==United States== The number of foreign domestic workers in the United States is relatively small compared to other regions; the country has about 200,000, half of Lebanon's total. About 7.5 percent are from Asia, most from the Philippines. Labor-rights movements and protests address the same complaints as those of foreign domestic workers elsewhere. ==Causes== Foreign domestic workers worldwide (including democratic or developed countries, such as the United States) note wage-and-hour violations, restrictions on freedom of movement, abuse, and isolation. Workers frequently receive an inadequate wage or less than minimum wage. Many consider themselves as working around the clock, since their workplace is also their residence. Since these workers are legally vulnerable, they may be physically or mentally abused by employers. Many workers report feelings of isolation, due to strict supervision and the inability to leave the household, and rely on their phones for entertainment, information and connection with loved ones. Foreign domestic workers see their treatment as similar to slavery; workers may go months without being paid, and cannot leave a position due to strict local laws, confiscation of their passport by employers, and lack of funds to return to their home country. ==Unconventional protests== ===Erwiana Sulistyaningish=== On January 11, 2014, photos of severely-beaten Hong Kong-based domestic worker Erwiana Sulistyaningsih were posted on Facebook. The photos were quickly shared by an Indonesian journalist and, three days later, a Facebook group entitled Justice for Erwiana and All Migrant Domestic Workers Committee was formed. The group attracted national and international attention, and by January 16 it had organized a protest in conjunction with the Asian Migratory Coordinating Body (AMCB). The movement was reported by the South China Morning Post, NewsForAfrica, Daily Mail, The New York Times, and Australia's ABC News. Although Sulistyaningsih's case was not unprecedented, social media brought her broad support in the form of events, petitions, and protests from international organizations. She continues to advocate for domestic migrant-worker rights. ===2005 Hong Kong consulate-hopping=== On December 15, 2005, foreign domestic workers participated in a consulate-hopping and Hall of Shame Awards protest. Many protesters were dressed as politicians and figures from their home country, such as Nepal's king Gyanendra who was crowned King of Tyrants. As the protesters visited consulates and presented awards for poor governance by their home countries, they were doing the same for the government of Hong Kong. A man representing Chief Executive Donald Tsang received an Edward Scissorhands Award for cutting wages and benefits and imposing a monthly tax on their employers. The protest ended in front of the U.S. consulate, with a Terror Award presented to a costumed George W. Bush and protesters calling the U.S. the number-one terrorist. ==References== Category:Domestic workers Category:Labour law Category:Migrant workers ","title":"Foreign domestic worker protests"},{"id":"60284651","text":"Péter Piti (4 June 1935 - 31 January 1978) was a Hungarian wrestler.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Goodsir, to the southeast. Mount Vaux can be seen from Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway, which traverses the western foot of the mountain, as well as from Emerald Lake. Vaux is pronounced Vox, rhymes with box.BC Geographical Names ==History== The mountain was named in 1858 by James Hector for his friend William Sandys Wright Vaux (1818–1885), a resident antiquarian at the British Museum who helped secure funds to support Hector's Palliser Expedition report.Mount Vaux PeakFinderMount Vaux from Emerald Lake The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1901 by Charles E. Fay, James Outram, and J. Henry Scattergood, with Christian Hasler Sr. as guide.American Alpine Club Publications - Joseph Henry Scattergood, 1877-1953 Outram described the view of the peak from Emerald Lake in his book, \\"In the Heart of the Canadian Rockies\\" as follows, \\"The drive is a lovely one, particularly where the \\"long- drawn aisles\\" of stately firs open out a vista piercing the tall, tapering trees, that form a grand enshadowed avenue nearly a mile in length, beyond which the white sunlit crest of glacier-crowned Mt. Vaux leaps high into the heavens.\\"In the Heart of the Canadian Rockies, James Outram, Rocky Mountain Books, 2007 ==Geology== Mount Vaux is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Cambrian periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Vaux is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C. Precipitation runoff from Mount Vaux drains into tributaries of the Kicking Horse River which is a tributary of the Columbia River. ==See also== *List of mountains of Canada *Geography of British Columbia ==References== View of Ottertail Range from west with Vaux (left), Chancellor Peak (center), Mount Goodsir (right) ==External links== * Weather forecast: Mount Vaux * Parks Canada web site: Yoho National Park * Sonny Bou website: Climbing photos Vaux Vaux Vaux ","title":"Mount Vaux"},{"id":"60284705","text":"Euastacus dalagarbe is a species of freshwater crayfish endemic to Australia that belongs to the family Parastacidae. It has a small range in New South Wales and is regarded by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as \\"critically endangered\\". == Description == Euastacus dalagarbe is one of four new species of freshwater crayfish that were first described by Coughran in 2005 during surveys of the northeastern part of New South Wales. It is intermediate in morphology between Euastacus setosus and the more spiny members of the genus. The rostrum of the holotype was long. The dorsal surface of the body is greenish-brown, and the ventral surface and the abdomen brown. The chelae are greenish-blue dorsally and the walking limbs are pale tan, both being dull orange ventrally. There is a blue spine with a yellow tip immediately behind the eye. == Ecology == Euastacus dalagarbe is often host to small flatworms in the order Temnocephalida. === Distribution and habitat === Euastacus dalagarbe is endemic to a small area in the Border Ranges National Park in New South Wales. It is known from a number of gullies and small, headwater streams in forests at altitudes of over . The total area of occupancy is about and is fragmented into eight separate locations. It burrows under stones in the mud and clay to reach moist areas. It shares its range with the larger and much spinier Euastacus sulcatus which tends to be present in the larger creeks while E. dalagarbe occupies the smaller ones, many of which dry up in summer. === Conservation status === The species has very specific habitat requirements and is threatened by habitat loss. Forest fires or other natural disasters could significantly impact populations, and because of its fragmented range, it is particularly vulnerable to habitat loss, with little possibility of dispersing to new locations. Climate change may force it to higher elevations to find the cool waters it needs. Another cause for concern are the feral cats, foxes and domestic livestock that prey on it or pollute the waters where it lives. Cane toads, which have invaded its range, may also impact on populations, and for all these reasons, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as \\"critically endangered\\". == References == == Further reading == * Category:Euastacus Category:Freshwater crustaceans of Australia Category:Vulnerable fauna of Australia Category:Endemic fauna of Australia Category:Crustaceans described in 2005 ","title":"Euastacus dalagarbe"},{"id":"60284716","text":"Mineplex is a Minecraft minigame server.

It was developed starting in 2005 by the Disability Justice Collective, a group of \\"Black, brown, queer and trans\\" people including Patty Berne, Mia Mingus, Stacey Milbern, Leroy F. Moore Jr., Eli Clare, and Sebastian Margaret.\\" In disability justice, disability is not defined in \\"white terms, or male terms, or straight terms.\\" Disability justice also acknowledges that \\"ableism helps make racism, christian supremacy, sexism, and queer- and transphobia possible\\" and that all those systems of oppression are intertwined. The disability justice framework is being applied to the intersectional reexamination of a wide range of disability, human rights, and justice movements. ==Origins== Initially conceived by queer, disabled women of color, Patty Berne, Mia Mingus, and Stacey Milbern, in the San Francisco Bay Area, Disability Justice was built in reaction to their exclusion from mainstream disability rights movement and disability studies discourse and activism, as well as the ableism in activist spaces. They were later joined by Leroy Moore, Eli Clare, and Sebastian Margaret. Disability justice centers \\"disabled people of color, immigrants with disabilities, queers with disabilities, trans and gender non-conforming people with disabilities, people with disabilities who are houseless, people with disabilities who are incarcerated, people with disabilities who have had their ancestral lands stolen, amongst others.\\" Sins Invalid, the group through which the founders were connected, defines disability justice through ten key principles: intersectionality, leadership by those most affected, anti- capitalism, solidarity across different activist causes and movements, recognizing people as whole people, sustainability, solidarity across different disabilities, interdependence, collective access, and collective liberation. The disability justice work of the Bay area activists has informed the development of the Disability Justice Initiative in Washington, D.C. On July 26th, 2018, the 28th anniversary of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), the Center for American Progress (CAP) formally announced its Disability Justice Initiative, under the direction of Rebecca Cokley. CAP is the first public policy think tank to specifically focus on disability. Recognition of the need for an intentional and intersectional approach was driven in part by attempts to cut the Affordable Care Act. In April 2019, Performance Space New York hosted a three-day festival developed around the Disability Justice framework. Performance Space New York worked with the political arts group Arika, the Whitney Museum of American Art and others to bring together disabled artists and writers. Entitled I wanna be with you everywhere (IWBWYE), the festival attempted to create an experience of “access intimacy,” in which needs were \\"respected, anticipated, and lovingly welcomed\\". == Critiques of Disability Rights == Like earlier critiques of reproductive rights by reproductive justice activists and critiques of environmentalism by environmental justice activists, the founders of the disability justice movement thought the disability rights movement and disability studies overly focused on straight white men with physical disabilities to the exclusion of others. Many in the disability justice movement were also critical of an emphasis on rights without a broader examination of systems of oppression (for example, the right to an education does not mean that all education is equitable). Writer and activist Audre Lorde is frequently referenced as inspirational to the disability justice movement, for works such as her essay “A Burst of Light: Living with Cancer,” which addresses disability, illness, and racial justice, emphasizing that “We do not live single issue lives”. Writers such as Catherine Jampel have emphasized the importance of disability justice to an intersectional reexamination of environmental justice. Writers such as Jina B. Kim draw upon disability justice and \\"crip-of-color\\" critiques in an attempt to develop an intersectional critical disability methodology which emphasizes that all lives are \\"enriched, enabled, and made possible\\" through a variety of means of support. ==See also== *Disability rights movement *Disability studies *Spoon theory == Further reading == * Bartlett, Jennifer, Sheila Black, and Michael Northen. 2011.

It increased the wind generating capacity in the state by 20% when it came online in late 2018. The facility is financed, owned, and operated by Xcel Energy, the largest public utility in the state. The project was developed primarily for its numerous economic benefits since Xcel previously met the minimum 30% requirement of Colorado's 2020 renewable portfolio standard. ==Facility details== The facility consists of two wind farms that occupy 95,000 acres of leased private land. The largest grouping of turbines is within Elbert County near the community of Matheson and located about 60 miles southeast of Denver. A smaller grouping of turbines is located 35 miles east and spans the intersections of Cheyenne, Kit Carson, and Lincoln County near the town of Hugo. 83 miles of new 345 kV overhead transmission line carry the electricity to the Xcel Energy substation near Deer Trail in Arapahoe County. Most components for the 300 Vestas 2.0 MW turbines were produced at the four nearby manufacturing facilities in Pueblo, Brighton, and Windsor, Colorado, which together employ about 3,500 people. Overall, it is estimated that each turbine supports about 30 jobs over the course of its lifetime through its manufacturing, supply chain, construction, and operation. The facility is also expected to generate $180 million in landowner lease payments and property tax revenues in the counties where it resides. Xcel Energy contracted Invenergy to lead the development and asset management of the facility through the construction phase. Mortenson Construction served as the EPC contractor for the project. Construction began in June 2017 and completed in December 2018, employing about 350 workers. The facility consists of 300 turbines, two substations, maintenance building, access roads, and transmission lines. About 10 permanent jobs were also created to maintain the facility, and Xcel has partnered with the Vestas operations group to assist with maximizing the electricity production. It is expected to generated enough electricity to meet the needs of about 325,000 Colorado homes. ==See also== *Wind power in Colorado *Environmental impact of wind power *List of wind farms in the United States ==External links== * Rush Creek Wind and Transmission Project - Fact Sheet ==References== Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2018 Category:Wind farms in Colorado Category:Buildings and structures in Elbert County, Colorado Category:Buildings and structures in Lincoln County, Colorado ","title":"Rush Creek Wind Project"},{"id":"60284870","text":"Sanhe () is a town under the administration of Pubei County, Guangxi, China. , it has 1 residential community and 8 villages under its administration. == References == Category:Township-level divisions of Guangxi Category:Pubei County ","title":"Sanhe, Guangxi"},{"id":"60284874","text":"Samuel Cooper Gardiner was an English born Canadian international lawn bowler. ==Bowls career== He won a silver medal in the pairs at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Vancouver with Dick Williams and was the President of the North Vancouver Lawn Bowling Club. ==Awards== Both he and Dick Williams were inducted into the North Shore Sports Hall of Fame in 1968. ==Personal life== He emigrated to Canada at the age of 20. ==References== Category:1888 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Canadian male bowls players Category:Commonwealth Games silver medallists for Canada Category:Commonwealth Games medallists in lawn bowls Category:Bowls players at the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games ","title":"Sam Gardiner (bowls)"},{"id":"60284962","text":"Stellman is a surname.

Timber structures were installed by Norwegian firm Moelven Limtre, including load-bearing structures in glued laminated timber. Cross laminated timber were used for stairwells, elevator shafts and balconies. As the main vertical/lateral structural elements and the floor spanning systems of Mjøstårnet are constructed from timber, the building is considered an all-timber structure.

It is native to India and Sri Lanka. Joseph Dalton Hooker and Thomas Thomson, the British botanists who first formally described the species under the basionym Orophea heyneana, named it after Benjamin Heyne a German botanist who collected and described many plant species from India. ==Description== It is a tree reaching 12 meters in height. Its leathery, oval to lance-shaped leaves are 3-11.5 by 2-4.5 centimeters with pointed or rounded bases and pointed to tapering tips. The upper side of the leaves are matt and hairless, while the undersides are covered in sparse, fine hairs. The leaves have 6-10 pairs of secondary veins emanating from their midribs. Its petioles are 3-7 by 1.2 millimeters and covered in sparse, fine hairs. The flowers are on fleshy, densely hairy pedicels that are 2.5-5 by 0.5-0.9 millimeters. The pedicels have an oval, basal bract that is 1 by 1 millimeters, and another upper bract that is 1-1.5 by 1-2 millimeters. Its flowers have 3 oval sepals that are 1.5-2 by 2-2.5 millimeters. The sepals are covered in dense, brown hairs on their outer surface and sparse hairs on their inner surface. Its 6 petals are arranged in two rows of 3. The yellow, oval to lance-shaped, outer petals are 7-14 by 2.5-6 millimeters and come to a point at their tips. The outer surface of the outer petals are covered in dense, brown, fine hairs while the inner surface is sparsely hairy. The margins of the outer petals are slightly wavy when mature. The inner petals are yellow with red to purple stripes. The inner petals are 6.5-8.5 by 4.5-6.5 millimeters. The inner petals have dense, fine hairs on their outer surface. The inner surface of inner petals is covered in glandular hairs that become longer at the tip and cause the petals to interlock to form a dome. Its flowers have stamen that are 0.4-0.7 by 0.4-0.6 millimeters. Its flowers have 9-10 carpels that are 0.9-1.4 by 0.4-0.5 millimeters. The carpels have 4-6 ovules.

Higgins and Katherine Chapin. Milton was a founder of the Norton Company and superintendent of the Washburn Shops. As a teenager, Higgins attended Worcester High School. He attended Worcester Polytechnic Institute and graduated in 1893. For several months afterwards, he worked as a machinist in one of his father's shops, after which he entered the National University Law School in Washington, D.C. At this time, Higgins was appointed assistant examiner in the U.S. Post Office. ==Career== Upon receiving his law degree in 1896, Higgins resigned his job at the post office, returned to Worcester, and was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar. He opened his own practice, specializing in patent law for several years. While doing this, he was in charge of the patent and legal matters of the Norton Companies, which demanded so much time and attention that he retired from the general practice of law and began working exclusively for the Norton companies. In 1901, while managing an electric-furnace plant in New York, Higgins invented a water- cooled electric-furnace in which alundum was made commercially. For this invention, he received the John Scott Medal and Premium Award from the City of Philadelphia in 1913. ==Family== In 1898, Higgins married his first wife, Edgenie Gertrude Brosius. After she died, Higgins married Mary Sprague Green in 1914. ==Later life== Aldus Chapin Higgins House In 1921, Higgins commissioned Grosvenor Atterbury to design a house modeled after the Compton Wynyates estate in England. It is an eclectic structure 2-1/2 stories in height, with its exterior finished in stucco, brick, and stone. It consists of two roughly rectangular wings, set at right angles to each other and joined by a central octagonal entry. The octagonal tower is crowned by a crenellated battlement. The upper levels are generally finished in half-timbered stucco, in some places decorated by additional foliate carvings. Many of its leaded casement windows are antiques shipped from Europe, and the house's Great Hall has architectural features removed from an Italian monastery. After the death of Mary Higgins, the house was donated to Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1971, and now houses the Office of Alumni Relations.

She was born and raised in Regina, Saskatchewan, but currently resides in Winnipeg, Manitoba—a location that has had a direct influence on her current artistic practice. As an artist of Métis ancestry, Boyer's personal connection to the traditional narratives and practices of her Indigenous culture are continually articulated within her work. The combination of these complex historical narratives coupled with an investigation of personal familial stories join together in shaping Boyer's research and artistic practice, as she explores themes of place and identity. == Early life and education == In 2010, Boyer received her Bachelor of Fine Arts at the University of Regina, and she proceeded to complete her MFA at the University of Manitoba in 2018. Over the course of her educational journey, Boyer also worked as the gallery and collections coordinator of the First Nations University of Canada. While maintaining this position, Boyer organized several symposiums, and in 2015 she aided in the implementation of Performing Turtle Island: Fluid Identities and Community Continuities—a national symposium focused on investigating the connection between Indigenous theatre and performance and Indigenous identity and community health. == Career == Dedicated to the investigation and contemplation of Métis visual culture, Boyer explores her concepts through various mediums. Her contemporary beading practice is rooted in the traditions of Indigenous culture and has also extended toward feminist contemplations of agency for Indigenous women in craft—a subject that was highlighted in the exhibition Material Girls, Dunlops Art Gallery, which toured nationally across Canada in 2015, including venues such as Rodman Hall Art Centre at Brock University, and Contemporary Calgary. For Boyer, the commitment she devotes to the labour-intensive process of beading is motivated by the connection it evokes with her familial memories; it is a practice of care and connection that has been shared among generations of women in her family. More recently, as a prolific beadworker, Boyer has also developed an extensive body of beadwork executed as \\"visualmaps\\". They are pieces that allude to stories of identity and place and can be \\"read as microcosms of an intersection of cultural and physical space\\". Water Meets Body is a solo exhibition, held at the University of Winnipeg's Gallery 1C03, which will run from February 28-April 6 (2019), and the installations it features are created with video, sculpture and textiles. Referencing the specific intersection of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, Boyer explores her personal relation to this geographic space. == Exhibitions == * Water Meets Body, Gallery 1C03, Winnipeg (2019) * The Prairie Rose Won't Mourn Us, Zalucky Contemporary, Toronto (2018) * Labour is the Body; Time is the Bridge, School of Art Gallery, Winnipeg (2018) * Li Salay, Art Gallery of Alberta, Edmonton (2018) * Crafting the Future, OCADU Canadian Craft Biennial (2017) * Out of Repetition, Difference, Zalucky Contemporary, Toronto (2017) * LandMarks 2017/ Repères 2017, Place and Placelessness, Winnipeg (2017) * BeadSpeak at Slate Fine Art Gallery Regina (2016) * Anishnaabensag Biimskowebshkigewag (Native Kids Ride Bikes) Dunlop Art Gallery, Regina (2016) * Material Girls, Dunlop Art Gallery, Regina (2015) == References == Category:Created via preloaddraft Category:Canadian women artists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Métis artists Category:Canadian Métis people Category:Artists from Regina, Saskatchewan Category:University of Regina alumni Category:University of Manitoba alumni ","title":"Katherine Boyer"},{"id":"60285213","text":"David Nicholls (born 3 November 1956) is an English former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. ==Career== Born in Bradford, Newton began his career with Huddersfield Town.

From 1952 to 1972, he was Deputy Commissioner of Public Welfare for the City of Philadelphia, and simultaneously served as Superintendent of the Philadelphia Prison System. By virtue of office, he was the lead named defendant in Jackson v. Hendrick, which set important legal precedents regarding humane conditions and overcrowding in US prisons. He was previously Chief Probation Officer for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. During World War II, he served in the US Navy as prison administrator for the 12th Naval District based in San Francisco, California. His career was bookended by service in the Catholic Church. As a young man he entered the Jesuit formation and taught Latin at Regis High School in New York City. After retiring from government service, he became one of the most senior laypeople in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, leading Adult Social Services - including the management of various nursing homes and shelters, and related programs. He was made a Knight of St. Gregory the Great by Pope John Paul II. ==Early Life== Edward was the first child born to Foscola Orrimela (F.O.) Hendrick and his second wife Helen C. Hendrick (née O'Neil). Foscola was an inventor and restaurateur, serving as general manager of Childs Restaurants, which was owned by his mother's family. Foscola's first wife, Frederikke Marie Blix, had died in 1902, leaving Foscola with four children. Foscola subsequently met and married Helen C. O'Neil, who had been a cashier in one of the Childs restaurants. In addition to Edward, Foscola and Helen had three further children: Helen, Catherine, and James. As a boy, Edward attended Xavier High School in New York City, and then proceeded into the Jesuit formation, attending Woodstock College and Georgetown University. ==Career== In 1940, Hendrick was appointed US Probation Officer for the District of New Jersey, by the Honorable Guy Leverne Fake; the appointment was confirmed by US Attorney General Robert H. Jackson. In 1943, Hendrick accepted a transfer to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, reporting to Randolph E. Wise, Chief US Probation Officer. When Wise resigned, Hendrick was appointed to succeed him. Wise and Hendrick formed a professional relationship that would span another 40 years, through the City of Philadelphia (1952–1972) and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia (1973–1984), when both men retired. In July 1944, Hendrick was granted a leave of absence from his federal role, in order to join the US Navy in support of World War II. During the war, he ran several Navy prisons in the Western US. In 1952, Wise was appointed Philadelphia's first Commissioner of Public Welfare. Wise named Hendrick as one of his three Deputy Commissioners, with a specific focus on the city's penal system. They were part of a wave of reformers coming in under Joseph Clark, who was the city's first Democratic mayor in 68 years. Wise and Hendrick would continue in their respective roles through the next 20 years under Mayors Clark, Dilworth, and Tate. Hendrick was recognized as a progressive and vocal advocate of prison reform efforts – mounting campaigns to end prison overcrowding, to improve staffing and training levels, and to offer inmates rehabilitation and vocational programs. As early as 1957, Hendrick gave an interview to The Philadelphia Inquirer where he called attention to the issue of overcrowding and under-staffing in his own prison system, lobbying for the construction of a new facility \\"to replace the overcrowded, outdated Moyamensing Prison\\". Nevertheless, the Philadelphia prison population exploded during his tenure, the city did not provide adequate funding to expand capacity or programs, and the system began to crack. On July 4, 1970, inmates at Holmesburg Prison rioted. In February 1971, five inmates filed a class action (Jackson v. Hendrick), \\"seeking injunctive relief from conditions of confinement alleged to violate the prisoners' constitutional and statutory rights\\". Over 15 years the case worked its way through the legal system, ultimately to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. In 1972, a frustrated Hendrick surprised new Mayor Frank Rizzo by resigning his City post and joining the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, to help lead the Catholic Social Services Administration. The move should not have been a great surprise, as his friend and boss Randolph Wise had also left the City and joined the Archdiocese, just months prior. In 1984 at the age of 74, Hendrick retired from the Archdiocese. In 1986, Pope John Paul II made him a Knight of St. Gregory; he was invested by Cardinal John Krol. He died at his home in Philadelphia on August 12, 1987. ==References== Category:Knights of St. Gregory the Great Category:1910 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Woodstock College alumni Category:Georgetown University alumni Category:Xavier High School (New York City) alumni Category:People from East Orange, New Jersey ","title":"Edward J.

In 1938 Cox graduated from the University of Hawaii with a B.S. degree in Physics and Mathematics. He earned his Masters degree in Geology from Harvard in 1941. == Career == Cox spent the next four years working with the U.S. Geological Survey. After World War II, his career path lead him to accomplishing a good deal of research in hydrogeology, earthquake and tsunami research, and the environment. In 1946 he returned home to work for the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Association (HSPA). At HSPA, he was put in charge of the water development and research program of water and geology. For the next 14 years, Cox worked on Arno Atoll, Western Samoa, the Marshall Islands and the Marianas. He was the first to define the sigmoidal mixing curve in a fresh water lens, which he discovered by using a series of sampling tubes. Cox was good at recognizing needs that could be taken care of by science. After the 1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake created a destructive tsunami, he wanted to make a wave-based warning system for tsunamis. He wanted to know the height and velocity of quake-generated waves, what time they would arrive, what direction they would come from, and what the destruction impact may be. In 1946, 1952, 1957, 1960, and 1964 Cox gathered data from tsunamis that struck Hawaii. His data later became are part of today's Pacific Tsunami warning system. In the early 1960s, Cox became a professor of geology at the University of Hawaii, remaining in that position until 1985.

Youngest child of Western Union founder Hiram Sibley and Elizabeth Tinker Sibley, she grew up in a family that valued service, faith, and the arts. She is best known as the founder of the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester, and patron of Rochester's Hochstein School of Music & Dance. With her mother, she was a major supporter of the Homeopathic Hospital (later Genesee Hospital). == Early life and education == Hiram Sibley's youngest child, Emily Sibley, was born within a few years of the founding of her father's most famous endeavour, Western Union. The financial success of the company created stupendous wealth for him and for many other Rochesterians. While little is known about Emily Sibley's early education, early opportunities for travel contributed to her interest in art and culture. In 1864-1866, Hiram Sibley travelled through Europe, in part to negotiate with the Czar of Russia to run a telegraph line across the Bering Strait from Alaska to Russia, taking his wife and daughter with him to join his son, Hiram Watson Sibley, who was already studying abroad. Emily's schooling and travels during this period were documented in a diary, now in the collection of the Memorial Art Gallery Archives. She records visits to museums and picture galleries, concerts, and parades. She was a boarding school student in Paris before the family returned to Rochester in 1866.

At some point in the year, the Averell family returned to Rochester, and her son James George (called J.G.) was born on December 23, 1877. By early 1878, Ike Averell bought out the previous shareholders of the Bank of Monroe, and became President, with Hiram Sibley on the board of directors. By May 1880, financial problems had started to emerge, problems which continued for several years. While not reported until after his death, in July 1883 Hiram Sibley added a codicil to his will ensuring that Ike would have no access to Sibley family funds at any time in the future. Less than a week after signing the codicil, Hiram & Elizabeth Sibley, and Emily Sibley Averell and her two children departed for a lengthy stay in Europe. By the time the family returned in June 1884, Isaac Averell was no longer residing in Rochester and was listed in the Alameda, California city directory. Upon her return to Rochester, Emily Sibley Averell moved into a new home around the corner from her parents at 11 Prince Street. Within two years, diphtheria claimed the life of young Louise, age 9. Separated from her husband, a friendship blossomed between Emily Sibley Averell and James Sibley Watson, son of her father's partner, Don Alonzo Watson. \\"Jimmie\\" and his sister Belle likely met up with Emily and her family in Europe in 1883, and did return with them on the SS Oregon on June 16, 1884. By 1885, James Watson was writing Emily regularly whenever he was out of town on hunting trips. He also was part of an extended Sibley family trip to Yellowstone in 1889. In Fall 1890, Emily Sibley Averell spent several months in Santa Barbara, California, establishing residency in order to divorce Isaac Averell. On January 5, 1891, the Democrat and Chronicle reported that \\"Emily S. Averill [sic] has instituted an action for divorce against Isaac Averill.\\" Emily Sibley Averell and James Sibley Watson were married on April 6, 1891. Emily and Jimmie traveled to Spain and Morocco for their honeymoon, and in 1892-1893, the family traveled to Egypt. In fall 1893, Emily's son J.G. Averell enrolled as a student at Saint Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, and the next summer, a son, James Sibley Watson, Jr. (called Sibley), was born to Emily and Jimmie on August 10, 1894. Subsequent family travels were documented in James Sibley Watson, Jr.'s \\"Baby Book,\\" in which Emily Sibley Watson documented annual trips at the time of Sibley's birthday. == Philanthropy == Watson was raised in a philanthropic environment. Her mother, Elizabeth Tinker Sibley, supported churches in her home town of North Adams, Massachusetts, Sibley, Illinois, as well as Rochester, New York, and was the founder of one of Rochester's early homeopathic hospitals. === Homeopathic hospital === Beginning in the late 1880s, Emily Sibley Averell participated with other family members in the support of the Homeopathic Hospital (later the now-defunct Genesee Hospital). Both the Sibley and Watson families, including Emily's soon-to-be husband, James Sibley Watson, were active supporters. Emily Sibley Watson's children from both her first and second marriage were involved in fundraising. In 1898, Watson donated a new maternity ward to the hospital. === Fine arts === Memorial Art Gallery, 1913 Watson's art collection began after her first marriage and continued throughout her life. In 1881, she became actively involved in the Rochester Ladies Art Exchange (organized in 1879), a charitable organization that fostered the interests of art in the community through exhibitions, sales and art classes, particularly focusing on the work of local craftswomen and artists. She loaned works from her personal collection to the Art Exchange's 1881 Loan Exhibition. She was one of the Art Exchange's managers as early as 1883. Beginning in 1886, the Art Exchange began to host exhibitions in partnership with the Rochester Art Club. Throughout the 1890s, Watson supported local artists, purchasing art from exhibitions of the Art Club as early as 1893 (ledger of Art purchases, Memorial Art Gallery archives). After the 1877 closing of the Powers Art Gallery and the 1899 auction of Daniel W. Powers' art collection in New York City, the Rochester Art Club increased its campaign for a public art museum in Rochester. By 1903, the Art Club began to solicit art for such a museum, receiving donations from local and nationally- known artists and collectors. While the Art Club continued its annual exhibitions and continued to report progress on creating a Fine Arts Museum for Rochester, other individuals and groups would ultimately be successful in fulfilling the Art Club's vision. Watson's son J.G. Averell was a budding architect and active amateur sportsman when he died of typhoid at age 26 in 1904. Given her family's history of donating memorials in the name of deceased family members, it is likely that Watson was soon considering how she might best commemorate her son. University of Rochester president Rush Rhees had been thinking about an art museum on campus as early as 1905. Watson's donation of the Memorial Art Gallery to the University of Rochester was publicly announced on April 22, 1912. A New York City architect, and Watson's nephew by marriage,, John Allyne Gade of the firm Foster, Gade, and Graham, designed the Renaissance Revival structure, modeling some of its details after the Malatesta Temple in Rimini, Italy. J.G. Averell had visited Rimini the summer before he died and made measured drawings of the building. From its opening on October 8, 1913 to her death in 1945, Watson and her husband were dedicated supporters of the Memorial Art Gallery. They funded an addition to the 1913 building in 1926, made up shortfalls in the Gallery's budget in the years before it had significant endowments, and donated generously from their personal collection as well as purchasing art out of exhibitions. More than 500 objects from Emily and James Sibley Watson, with additions from subsequent family generations, are part of the collection of the Memorial Art Gallery. === Music === Paralleling her interest and involvement with the visual arts was Watson's love of music, which she shared with her family. Watson's brother, Hiram Watson Sibley, founded Rochester's outstanding Sibley Music Library in 1904. Watson's son, J.G. Averell, studied violin under the tutelage of Hermann Dossenbach, and Watson supported Dossenbach's European travels. Of all the people whom Watson took under her wing, David Hochstein was the best known. A musical prodigy born to Jewish immigrants who arrived from Russia as part of the great wave of Eastern European migration in the late nineteenth century, Hochstein was becoming known to the musical community in the years that overlapped with Emily’s son J.G.’s death. Along with George Eastman, Emily Sibley Watson supported young Hochstein's violin studies abroad. After his death in World War I, Emily Sibley Watson purchased the Hochstein family home so that it could be used to create the settlement school that became the Hochstein School of Music & Dance. For her gifts to music, Watson was elected a charter member of the Rochester Music Hall of Fame. == Death and burial == Watson died in her home on Prince Street on February 8, 1945. She is interred in Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester, NY. Her tombstone and the Watson family monument were designed by local architect Claude Fayette Bragdon. == References == Category:People from Rochester, New York Category:American women philanthropists Category:1855 births Category:1945 deaths Category:American patrons of the arts Category:Philanthropists from New York (state) ","title":"Emily Sibley Watson"},{"id":"60285468","text":"Tom Poole Tom Poole is the Chief Creative Officer and Senior Colorist at Company 3.

It is the third film in the Bill & Ted series, and the sequel to Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey (1991). Alex Winter, Keanu Reeves, and William Sadler reprise their roles as Bill, Ted, and the Grim Reaper, respectively, while Kristen Schaal, Samara Weaving, Brigette Lundy-Paine, Anthony Carrigan, Erinn Hayes, Jayma Mays, Holland Taylor, Kid Cudi, and Jillian Bell join the cast. In the film, Bill and Ted must write a song to unite humanity before time and space are destroyed. The film's script was laid out as early as 2010, but there were difficulties finding a distributor to back production. By May 2018, a distribution deal was secured and the film entered pre-production; filming commenced on July 1, 2019. Bill & Ted Face the Music was simultaneously released in theaters and through Premium VOD in the United States on August 28, 2020, by United Artists Releasing. It received generally positive reviews from critics. == Plot == In 2020, Bill Preston and Ted Logan have failed to write a prophesied song to unite the world, and time and space are beginning to collapse. Their wives are unhappy and Ted confides in Bill that he does not believe they will ever write the song. Kelly, the daughter of Bill and Ted's deceased time-travelling guide Rufus, arrives to take them to the future. They meet Kelly's mother, the Great Leader, who tells them that they have until 7:17 p.m. that night to write the song or reality will collapse. Realizing they will not be able to write the song in time, Bill and Ted use Rufus's time-traveling phone booth to steal the song from their future selves. However, their future selves are unsuccessful and their wives have left them; they blame their past selves for their failures. With Bill and Ted missing, the Great Leader sends a time-traveling robot named Dennis to kill them, hoping this will restore balance to the universe. Kelly travels back to the present to warn them, but instead meets their daughters, Billie and Thea, who decide to help their fathers create the song. Using Kelly's time machine, Billie and Thea recruit musicians Jimi Hendrix, Louis Armstrong, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ling Lun, and Grom, a drummer from before recorded history. Bill and Ted travel to 2025, where they have seemingly become successful. However, they are tricked by their future counterparts, who try to pass off a song by Dave Grohl as their own. Billie, Thea, and their band return to the present to meet up with Kelly and a time-displaced Kid Cudi, but Dennis inadvertently kills them and sends them to Hell. Bill and Ted travel to 2067 and find their elderly future selves on their deathbeds. The elder Bill and Ted give their younger selves a USB drive containing the fabled song written by \\"Preston / Logan\\", stating that it must be performed at 7:17 PM at \\"MP 46\\". Dennis appears, but stands down upon learning Bill and Ted have the song, and regretfully informs them that he killed their daughters. In an attempt to goad Dennis into killing them so they can rescue their daughters in Hell, Bill destroys the USB drive. This backfires as a distraught Dennis turns his weapon on himself, but Bill and Ted throw themselves in the way of the beam. All three are sent to Hell, where Bill and Ted locate their daughters and the band. With the help of their daughters, Bill and Ted settle their differences with their old bandmate Death to return everyone alive to the present. The group arrive on Interstate 210 at the MP 46 marker, just as reality is collapsing. Bill and Ted realize that the \\"Preston / Logan\\" on the USB drive actually refers to Billie and Thea, and that the song must be performed by everyone across time and space. They are joined by their wives, who have realized they are happiest in their current dimension. The four use Rufus' phone booth to create infinite copies of themselves across time and space, handing instruments to everyone who ever lived. Everyone across reality performs the song together, with Billie and Thea producing, while Bill and Ted lead the band on guitar. The universe is repaired and everyone returns to their proper time periods. == Cast == * Keanu Reeves as Theodore \\"Ted\\" Logan * Alex Winter as William S. \\"Bill\\" Preston, Esq. * Kristen Schaal as Kelly, daughter of Rufus and the Great Leader, and a messenger from the future.

Musician \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, talk show personality Guillermo Rodriguez and actor Nathan Head make cameos during the credits.http://nathanhead.tv/gallery%20-%20featurefilm%20-%20BillAndTedFaceTheMusic.html == Production == === Development === Through the production of the first two films in the Bill & Ted series, actors Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter and writers Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon had become close friends, though after the completion of Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey in 1991, there was no immediate plans for a sequel. The four had continued successful careers in the interim. Around 2005 during a red carpet event, a reporter asked Reeves if he had any interest in playing Ted again, which he responded positively to. This inspired the group to actually think about a third film. Conceptualization for this film began between the four around 2008. In an interview with MTV in September 2010, Winter confirmed that they had come onto an idea for a plot that they felt appropriate with Matheson and Solomon beginning to work on the script with significant input from Reeves and Winter. According to Winter, \\"We kicked around the idea over the years and had always thought if we could make something that was as kind of genuine in spirit as the originals and without falling prey to kind of retro cynicism or something that was unnecessary, it would be worth doing\\" and that \\"we have finally hit upon an idea that we think is pretty great.\\" Even at this early stage, the concept for the third film had involved Bill & Ted having reached middle age and still yet to achieve the prophesized music that brings world peace. First draft of the script had been completed by April 2011. By August 2012, Dean Parisot was attached to direct. While Reeves and Winter were both eager to return to their roles, there was little interest in the script from any studios. According to Matheson, the original films were considered \\"cult-y\\" by the studios, and wanted significant changes to the ideas that they had established, or even a reboot of the series. Studios also expressed concern that since the first film was not distributed internationally, there would not be a large audience for another sequel. Finding little traction with the studios, the group began trying to appeal to fans around 2014, being more public about the existence of the script and their desire to make it, as a means to show the studios there was a strong audience demand for the film. Reeves and Winter confirmed that the film was still planned in interviews over the following few years. They emphasized that this was more than just a money grab, but an earnest work. Solomon, speaking to Digital Spy in January 2018, said: Due to their messaging, fans began various campaigns to try to influence the studios to pick up the film for production. The producers decided to not repeat the anti-gay slurs that were casually used by titular characters in previous Bill & Ted movies—a decision that was praised by both Winter and Reeves. The movie's outlook changed after the release of John Wick in September 2014 which starred Reeves, according to Matheson. Reeves' career in the prior decade had been lackluster with several flops, but John Wick had renewed his career, and brought newfound attention to any potential projects he was attached to. This included the Bill & Ted script. Two outside media investors, David Haring and Patrick Dugan, came in to provide the financial backing for the film, and by the end of September 2014, more rigorous script reworking had begun while efforts were made to find a studio. Winter said that while John Wick did help with drawing attention to their script, he did not believe that the film was as fundamental to ultimately getting their film made, since they still struggled with longer- term financial deals from that point. Instead, Winter attributed the continued pressure from fans over social media to influence Hollywood that came with news that the film had means of going forward. Even with initial funding, it still took several years for them to make necessary deals for the actual production. Solomon said many of these deals fell through at the last minute; \\"We've been to the altar a few times. We get rejected right about the 'now you may kiss the bride' part of it.\\" During this time, they had secured Steven Soderbergh as executive producer, Scott Kroopf, who produced the original film, as producer, and affirmed Bill Sadler's intention to reprise his role as Death. By this point, the script was mostly finalized and known as Bill & Ted Face the Music. Winter said that of the concept of the script, \\"The longer it took us to get it made, in a way, the funnier that got.\\" According to Winter, they eventually had sufficient funds with a studio ready to go, and had added Alex Lebovici as a producer. They approached MGM to secure distribution, prior to its relaunch of Orion Pictures in September 2017. MGM accepted the offer, which Winter said was due to them having a complete package of production ready to go and the backing of fans. In an unusual move, MGM did not finance the film's production, but only took a 15% cut of the film's revenue for distribution and supplied a marketing package to be recouped from the revenue. The film was formally greenlit on May 8, 2018, with production handled by Hammerstone Studios. Alongside Soderbergh, Scott Fischer, John Ryan Jr. and John Santilli were named as executive producers, while Steve Ponce joined Kroopf and Lebovici as producers. On March 20, 2019, Winter and Reeves affirmed that the film's production was ready to start, and that they had secured a release date on August 21, 2020. ===Casting=== Both Winter and Reeves were confirmed to be in the movie once it was greenlit in May 2018. William Sadler was confirmed to be reprising his role as the Grim Reaper from the second film in March 2019. Brigette Lundy-Paine and Samara Weaving appeared as Ted's daughter Billie Logan and Bill's daughter Thea Preston, respectively. Kid Cudi was also announced as a cast member for the film, playing himself as he gets caught up in the events of the film. Anthony Carrigan was cast in June 2019 as Bill & Ted's yet-named adversary in the film. In late June 2019, it was announced that Amy Stoch would be returning as Missy, and Hal Landon Jr. would be returning as Ted's father, Captain Logan. Other casting announcements include recasts of characters from previous films, with Erinn Hayes as Elizabeth, Jayma Mays as Joanna, and Beck Bennett as Deacon, Ted's younger brother. Among casting announcements in July 2019 include Jillian Bell as Dr. Taylor Wood, the family therapist to both Bill and Ted's families, Holland Taylor as the Great Leader in the future San Dimas, and Kristen Schaal as Kelly, a messenger sent from the future for Bill & Ted. Also in June 2019, Backstage listed a casting call for extras to appear as various historical figures. With help from Jake Tapper, a number of veterans supported by the Wounded Warrior Project were also featured as extras during filming. Part of the writing and casting for the film was creating a supergroup of musicians across time for the film's conclusion. Solomon, Matheson, and Parisot ran through some of most influencing musicians and centered on Jimi Hendrix, Louis Armstrong and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played in the film by Jeremiah Craft, DazMann Still, and Daniel Dorr, respectively. In the case of Hendrix and Armstrong, they were able to secure rights to use the artists' likeness for the film but were forbidden to use them within the film's advertising nor could they use any of their musical works. Christian Scott was brought in to provide instrumental performance for Armstrong, while Ray Suen provided both the piano and guitar performances for Mozart and Hendrix. They included Ling Lun, believed to be the creator of Chinese music, to help diversify the group, and while the legends around Ling Lun identify him as male, the producers opted to cast Sharon Gee as Lun to help round out the cast, given that the Bill & Ted series had never been beholdened to historical accuracy. With Death as the group's bassist, they only needed a drummer and created the character of the cavewoman Grom for this, played by Patty Anne Miller, a real-life drummer for artists like Beyoncé and CeeLo Green. Tosin Abasi plays the \\"air guitar\\" riffs for Bill & Ted. There were no plans to recast the role of Rufus, played by George Carlin who had died in 2008. Instead, as tribute, Carlin appeared posthumously as a holographic tour guide in the future, using archival footage from the original film, and Kristen Schaal's character is Kelly, Rufus' daughter, who is named after Kelly Carlin, George Carlin's real-life daughter. Kelly Carlin was also given a cameo role in the film as well. There had been plans to have the older Bill & Ted travel back to the Circle K scene from the first film to ask Rufus for advice, which they would have used a combination of practical set reconstruction and computer-generated imagery to recreate the younger versions of Bill, Ted, and Rufus, but were limited by budget and time to make this work, and scrapped this approach. ===Filming=== Initial production and filming started on June 17, 2019, while cast filming commenced on July 1, 2019. The bulk of the filming took place in New Orleans during July 2019. Filming was completed by August 24, 2019. Filming of the scene with Dave Grohl took place in Los Angeles. Bonita Unified School District in Los Angeles County, California, which serves the cities of San Dimas and La Verne where the real- life San Dimas High School is located, has opened its doors to allow production to use the school on camera, although most of the actual filming in San Dimas for the first film was in a school in Arizona. ===Music=== Rather than focus on the hair metal of the original films, music director Jonathan Leahy involved groups such as Weezer, Mastodon and Lamb of God, who he believed represented the current state of electric guitar. He helped them compose songs for the film, such as Lamb of God's \\"The Death of Us\\", used in the future prison scene. As Tosin Abasi was also serving as the \\"air shredder\\" for Bill & Ted, Leahy brought in his band, Animals as Leaders, to play on the soundtrack version of the world-saving song. In addition to selecting the musical acts, Leahy also worked with Gibson to select the various styles of guitars that are used to represent various eras of music in the film. The soundtrack announced on August 13, 2020, and will be published by 10K Projects to be released alongside the film on August 28, 2020. Weezer released a music video for \\"Beginning of the End\\" on August 14, 2020. During a performance in August 2019, Kid Cudi announced that the soundtrack for the film will feature a remix of his 2010 song \\"Erase Me\\" done by Steve Aoki. ===Post-production=== Winter stated in a February 2020 interview that they had completed a \\"fantastic first cut\\" but were still working on visual effects and music, along with additional filming such as with Kid Cudi a few days prior. == Marketing == First images from the film were published by Entertainment Weekly on December 17, 2019. A teaser poster was released on February 5, 2020. A new poster and a trailer was released on June 9, 2020, unofficially referred to by fans as \\"Bill & Ted Day\\" as the date's digits 6 and 9 make up the duo's favorite number 69 from the first film. The second trailer was released along the announcement of the planned mixed theatric/video-on-demand release approach, on July 23, 2020. == Release == Bill & Ted Face the Music was originally scheduled to be released on August 21, 2020 by Orion Pictures through United Artists Releasing in the US and by Warner Bros. Pictures in the UK. Looper observed that the date's digits (8, 21, 20 and 20) coincidentally added up to 69, an in-universe reference to the first film. Due to the postponement of other films due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Face the Music was moved up a week to August 14, 2020 to fill vacated slots, before then being delayed to August 28, 2020 as to avoid conflicting with the rescheduled release of Tenet. As further complications from the pandemic continued to threaten movie theater openings, United Artists Releasing announced in late July that they would release Face the Music in a combined theatrical and Premium VOD premiere on September 1, 2020. Then, on August 6, 2020, Alex Winter announced that the film had been moved back to its August 28 slot. The film was distributed internationally by MGM. ==Reception== === Box office and VOD === Bill & Ted Face the Music grossed $400,000 from 1,007 theaters in its first day, and went on to debut to $1.1 million, finishing third at the box office. That same weekend, it was the top-rented film on FandangoNow, Apple TV, the iTunes Store, and Google Play. Fandango also announced that despite being released for only four days, the film was the most popular on the service for the entire month of August. In its second weekend the film made $765,000 from theaters and remained in either first or second place on every VOD platform, including Amazon Prime, Vudu, iTunes, FandangoNow, and Google Play. On September 30, Deadline Hollywood reported that the film had grossed an estimated $32 million from U.S. digital rentals up to that point. === Critical response === On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 224 reviews, with an average rating of 6.74/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"As wholesomely goofy as its heroes, Bill and Ted Face the Music is a rare long-belated sequel that largely recaptures the franchise's original charm.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Owen Gleiberman of Variety wrote: \\"It zips right along, it makes you smile and chortle, it's a surprisingly sweet- spirited love story... and it's a better tribute to the one-world utopian power of classic rock than Yesterday was. On a scale of one to 10, I wouldn't say that Face the Music goes to 11, but it's a most excellent sequel.\\" Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, John DeFore called the film \\"an uneven but likable return\\" and said: \\"Dean Parisot's Bill & Ted Face the Music is almost exactly as good as its two big-screen predecessors — make of that statement what you will — while cleaning up some, but not all, of the things that might make an old fan of those films cringe today.\\" == References == == External links == * Category:2020 films Category:2020s science fiction comedy films Category:American films Category:American science fiction comedy films Category:Bill & Ted Category:English-language films Category:Films about time travel Category:Films directed by Dean Parisot Category:Films postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in Vienna Category:Films set in China Category:Films set in New Orleans Category:Films set in Africa Category:Films set in prison Category:Films set in prehistory Category:Films set in the 18th century Category:Films set in 1922 Category:Films set in 1967 Category:Films set in 2020 Category:Films set in 2022 Category:Films set in 2025 Category:Films set in 2030 Category:Films set in 2067 Category:Films set in the 28th century Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in New Orleans Category:Films with screenplays by Ed Solomon Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Midlife crisis films Category:Orion Pictures films Category:Warner Bros. films ","title":"Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music"},{"id":"60285611","text":"Mitrephora keithii is a species of plant in the family Annonaceae. It is native to Myanmar, Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand. Henry Nicholas Ridley, the English botanist who first formally described the species, named it in honor of Dr. A. Keith who collected the sample that Ridley examined. ==Description== It is a small tree reaching 6 meters in height. Its leathery, oval to lance-shaped leaves are 7.5-17.5 by 2.5-5 centimeters with pointed bases tips. The upper side of the leaves are matt and hairless, while the undersides are covered in sparse, fine hairs. The leaves have 7-11 pairs of secondary veins emanating from their midribs. Its petioles are 3-8.5 by 1.5-3 millimeters and covered in sparse, fine hairs. The flowers occur in groups of 3 or fewer on a rachis. Flowers are attached to the rachis by fleshy, densely hairy pedicels that are 4.5-9 by 0.8-1.5 millimeters. The pedicels have an oval, basal bract that is 1.5 by 2 millimeters, and another upper bract that is 1-2.5 by 1.5-2.5 millimeters. Its flowers have 3 triangular sepals that are 3-4 by 3-4.5 millimeters. The sepals are covered in dense, brown hairs on their outer surface and sparse hairs on their inner surface.

It consists of 126.49 acres. The name Killykeskeame is an anglicisation of the Gaelic \\"Cill Choiscéim\\" which means the 'Church of the Footstep', referencing a medieval chapel that once was located in the townland. ==Name== The English version of the name for the townland is a close approximation to its original Gaelic pronunciation. However, as with many Irish placenames, the name has drifted from both the original and official pronunciation among some of its inhabitants. An incorrect, though recognised, form of \\"Killykespin\\" is now used by some people. ==History== The earliest historical remains in the townland consist of a Neolithic or Bronze Age Enclosure. Human activity from the Iron Age is attested from the presence of a ring fort, which are common archaeological features in drumlin landscape County Monaghan. The medieval chapel which gives the townland its name is, by folk tradition, associated with the MacMahon Lords of Dartree. Tradition states that this chapel was destroyed by Oliver Cromwell's soldiers during the Irish Confederate Wars in the 1650s. The religious history of the townland continued through the Penal Era when a Mass Rock was found in the townland. ==Irish Language== Irish Gaelic was the ordinary language of the people in the area until the nineteenth century. The form of Irish used was Oriel or East Ulster Irish. It is not known when exactly Irish ceased to be used as the ordinary medium of communication but it is likely that Irish continued to be used until the mid-nineteenth century. Throughout the Parishes of Killeevan and Aghabog, Irish words continue to be used in ordinary speech, especially for things relating to nature, agriculture and the landscape. The last traditional speaker of Irish in the parish of Killeevan was Mrs. Bridget Beggan, who died in the late 1930s. ==Landscape== The townland is located in the drumlin country of South Ulster. The undulating landscape is a creation of Ice Age glaciers which once covered the area. The townland is now mostly farmland, with some forestry, and a single lake. However, due to its position in the historic \\"Glens\\" district of northern Killeevan and Aghabog, it offers views of Northern Monaghan, Slieve Beagh, parts of County Fermanagh, Cavan and Tyrone. == References == Category:County Monaghan Category:County Monaghan articles missing geocoordinate data ","title":"Killykeskeame"},{"id":"60285729","text":"Digi Sport is a Hungarian sports television that was launched on 23 July 2009,a vailable only on the Digi TV platform.

Patented by the University of Minnesota, this apple variety is known botanically as “Malus Domestica”. The MN55 cultivar apple was originally develop two decades ago through natural cross-pollination. David Bedford and the team at the University of Minnesota also developed the popular Honeycrisp apple and its successor, SweeTango-brand Minnieska apple. The MN55 fruit is grown and sold under the licensed brand names, Rave® and First Kiss®. The quality of MN55 fruit is dependent upon climate, grower sites and production practices. To insure consistency in fruit quality the University of Minnesota limits the license of MN55. Outside Minnesota, MN55 is licensed to Stemilt Growers under the Rave brand. Minnesota commercial growers grow and sell the fruit under the brand name, First Kiss. == Characteristics == The MN55 produces early ripening fruit that are ready to pick in July. Medium to large in size, and globose- conical in shape, the apples have a crisp, juicy texture, and are similar in flavor to Honeycrisp. Its Monark parentage contributes to its quick ripening, its mostly dark red color, and long storage life. == Uses == Rave and First Kiss apples are intended for eating. Baking is not recommended, as the flesh is so delicate it falls apart. == Development and characteristics == * MN55 is crossbred without using genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This is a difficult task and took Bedford and Luby more than 14,000 tries. * From crossbreeding MN55 to producing the first commercial Rave apple took 20 years. * MN55 fruit fall off the tree before harvesting, so need to be monitored closely. ==Timeline== * 1997 – First seedling tree selected at a research center located near Lake Minnetonka in Excelsior, Minnesota. * 1998 - Asexual propagation succeeds * 2014 – United States patent PP26,412 filed * 2014 – Licensed to Stemilt Growers * 2017 – Stemilt releases Rave apple * 2018 – University of Minnesota Introduces First Kiss apple == References == Category:Apple cultivars with patented mutants Category:American apples Category:Apple cultivars ","title":"MN55 (apple)"},{"id":"60286081","text":"Dousdebes or Dousdebés is a surname.

He simultaneously proved a result showing that the positive false discovery rate (pFDR) is exactly equal to a Bayesian posterior probability, thereby providing the first direct connection between false discovery rates and Bayesian theory. In these works, he also invented the q-value, which is a false discovery rate analogue of the p-value. Storey then introduced false discovery rates and q-values as widely applicable measures of statistical significance in genomics, shifting the focus from false positive control to false discovery rate control. With Jeff Leek, Storey discovered that \\"expression heterogeneity\\", or unmodeled sources of systematic variation in gene expression data, are very prevalent and need to be modeled and corrected when analyzing genome-wide gene expression data. Leek and Storey introduced \\"surrogate variable analysis\\", which is a high-dimensional regression model that includes both known and unknown covariates. He has developed a number of methods for estimating this model. Recently, Storey has shifted his focus to population genomics, where he has introduced genome-wide models of allele frequencies, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and F-statistics that hold under arbitrary population structures. ==Honors and awards== * Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science 2011 * Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics 2012 * COPSS Presidents' Award 2015 * Mortimer Spiegelman Award 2015 ==References== ==External links== * Homepage Category:Living people Category:American statisticians Category:Princeton University faculty Category:Fellows of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics Category:Fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"John D.

Theodore Percival \\"Percy\\" Wilson (1819 – 8 August 1881), generally known as T. P. Wilson was an Anglican priest and author known for his pioneering, albeit brief, work in Adelaide, South Australia. ==History== Wilson was born in England, a son of Thomas Wilson, solicitor and later mayor of Adelaide and his wife Martha Wilson, née Greenell (1790 – 29 January 1858), whose sister Mary Anne Greenell was the mother of Alfred Russel Wallace. His parents and his four younger siblings emigrated to South Australia aboard Duke of Roxburghe in 1838. Wilson completed his master's degree at Brasenose College, Oxford, and was ordained a priest of the Church of England. He was sent out to Tasmania, where in 1845 he accepted a call to take over the newly built St John's Church, Adelaide, but instead returned to England on account of his wife's illness (but see reference below). Details of activities in Tasmania, an earlier wife and family (unspecified) mentioned in this article have not been found, and may be entirely mistaken. He was sent out to South Australia by the barque Derwent, arriving in December, 1847 in company with the Augustus Short, Lord Bishop of Adelaide, and Dr. Hale. He was appointed first Head Master of St Peter's College, at that time held in a small room behind Trinity Church, and also acted as Bishop's Chaplain, and in 1849 incumbent of MacGill and Walkerville churches. The college moved to its current location in 1850, and in 1851 Wilson resigned over differences with the school's governors. He served for some 15 months as incumbent of St John's Church, then returned to England at the end of 1852. He was appointed curate of Bardsley in 1854, and, at some unspecified date, \\"a living\\" near Shrewsbury. His last posting was as vicar of Pavenham in Bedfordshire, where he died. ==Other interests== *Wilson is known for at least one work of art, an historic sketch of the Hotel Brighton dated 5 November 1850, the day of his marriage. *Wilson was a confirmed teetotaler and almost certainly preached on the subject. Back in England, he entered a competition hosted by the Band of Hope, who were looking for a popular novel to promote their cause. Wilson's entry, Frank Oldfield, set partly in England and partly in South Australia, won the £100 prize, and was published to some critical acclaim. ==Family== Wilson married Barbara Sophia Cameron (born 1818, the fifth daughter of the Rev. Charles Richard Cameron, Rector of Swaby, Lincolnshire) at Kensington, South Australia on 5 November 1850. They had one daughter and five sons, Charles Thomas Wilson (born in Adelaide 14 October 1851) and Rev. Theodore Cameron Wilson (1857–1940) of Christ Church, Paignton among them. The similarly named Theodore Augustus Greenell Wilson (1831 – 31 August 1908), a prize-winning student at Saint Peter's College 1848–1850 and State government official, was a younger brother. See Thomas Wilson for details of other siblings. Theodore Percival Cameron Wilson (25 April 1888 - 23 March 1918), the \\"brilliant young school-teacher poet\\" a moving tribute who was killed at the front in WWI, was a son of Theodore Cameron Wilson (above). His Magpies in Picardy was published posthumously by The Poetry Bookshop. == References == Category:1819 births Category:1881 deaths Category:Australian Anglican priests Category:Australian temperance activists ","title":"T.

Traditionally the game was played mainly in Northern Ireland but the Kenilworth Bowling Club of Dublin joined the Irish Bowls Association in 1906 which prompted the merger into one team. With the exception of the Commonwealth Games players continue to represent a combined Ireland team. Roy Fulton is a record seven times singles champion closely followed by Martin McHugh with six wins. The singles championship is called the Dr Rusk Cup named after Dr John Rusk, President of the IBA and the singles representative player at the Lawn Bowls at the 1934 British Empire Games. The Pairs is called the T.W McMullan Cup, the Triples is known as the Charlie Clawson Cup and the Fours is known as the C.L MacKean Cup. The Women's National Championships were inaugurated in 1947 but only consisted of the pairs and fours initially. ==Irish National Bowls Championships== ===Men's Singles Champions=== {class=\\"sortable \\" - !width=\\"30\\"Year !width=\\"350\\"Champion !width=\\"350\\"Runner-Up - align=center1908 R.

She specialised in acute pain in women and was the first to study the changes that occur in the brain during parturition. ==Education== Holdcroft holds Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MB, ChB) and Doctor of Medicine (MD) degrees. == Research and career == Holdcroft has held many notable positions, including serving as the President of the Royal Society of Medicine (RSM) forum on maternity and the newborn, the Committee Member of the Obstetric Aneasthetists Association, British Medical Association (BMA ) medical academic staff Committee and as Chair of the Europain Visceral Pain Group. Her research considered the representation of gender and sex dimensions in medical research. She was supported by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the European Commission (EC). She was the first secretary and subsequent Chair of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Special Interest Group (SIG) on Sex Gender and Pain. The group presented a report documenting sex and gender differences in pain and analgesia. In the 1990s Holdcroft became interested in the use of cannabis in pain relief, and was one of the first UK doctors to perform clinical trials for the therapeutic use of the drug. She studied the impact of cannabis plant extract during surgery, leading a placebo-controlled study with patients suffering form chronic pain. She demonstrated that it does indeed provide pain relief, leading to a range of drugs that can be used for post-operative pain.

DC is the abbreviation of \\"Double Cassette\\", as the cassette contained two reels; International was intended to indicate that, from the beginning, several companies around the world supported the format with suitable tape cassette tape recorders, recorded music cassettes and blank cassettes. Since DC-International did not compete effectively against the similar Compact Cassette, it was discontinued in 1967.Grundig Technische Information, Ausgabe September 1965Zeitschrift „Tonband“, Ausgabe 5/1967 Starting in 1961, Philips (in conjunction with Grundig) began work in its Vienna tape production facilities, on a (HiFi)-compatible single-hole cassette. At the same time, a Philips team in Belgium developed a 2-hole cassette, under the name Pocket Recorder ( later-named Compact Cassette). Philips' management finally gave preference to this development, but informed its partner Grundig rather late, which led Grundig - who received an offer to participate in the Pocket Recorder, to abandon the DC-International cassette it developed without further ado. This was based upon construction drawings of the compact cassette, which Grundig had taken after their negotiations with Philips. The DC-International system was presented at the 1965 Stuttgart, Germany radio exhibition. At that time, Grundig was the largest tape recorder manufacturer worldwide and wanted to be represented in the newly created tape cassette market, as well.Grundig Technische Information, Ausgabe September 1965 == Construction == Construction of a DC-International cassette The DC- International cassette is a two-roll cassette tape which can be flipped over. The dimensions of a tape cassette (according to the DC-International system) are 120 mm × 77 mm × 12 mm, the weight is . The case is made of polystyrene, and a viewing window with scale incorporated into it, was included, so a user could view the tape from both sides of the cassette. The cassette has openings for the tape head and the erase head, as well as for the capstan pinch roller. A built-in pressure pad provides for tape-head contact. Like the Compact Cassette would later have, a recording lock against unintentional erasure of a cassette was present in the form of 2 recesses in the cassette. If an opening is closed, it prevents any recording on that side. For protection against dust and scratches, the cassette can be inserted into a protective case when not in use.Grundig Technische Information, Ausgabe September 1965 The tape's capable of recording 2 soundtracks in opposite directions. The tape speed is 5.08 cm/s = 2 ips, slightly faster than the Compact Cassette. Recording and playback in stereophonic sound would be possible with stereo devices, but there were never any such devices manufactured for this cassette format.Grundig Technische Information, Ausgabe September 1965Zeitschrift „Tonband“, Ausgabe 3/1965Zeitschrift „Tonband“, Ausgabe 2/1967 For a 90-minute DC-90 cassette (45 minutes per side), the tape length is 137 m with a triple play band (PES 18, thickness 0.018 mm). For a 120-minute DC-120 cartridge (60 minutes per side), the tape length is 185 m with quadruple play band (PES 12, thickness 0.012 mm). The tape itself consisted of polyester.Grundig Technische Information, Ausgabe September 1965Zeitschrift „Tonband“, Ausgabe 3/1965 DC-International empty cartridges and covers With the DC-International format, the focus was on music playback right from the start. At its launch, there were 25 pre-recorded music cassettes from Telefunken, Decca and RCA Victor available. These recordings on the cassettes ranged from country music to The Rolling Stones, the playing time is about 30 minutes per side. With a total playing time of about 60 minutes available, this was comparable to a phonograph record. The selling price of a pre-recorded cassette was 24 DM.Grundig Technische Information, Ausgabe September 1965 For home recordings, unrecorded, blank cassettes were available from Grundig, Telefunken, BASF and Agfa-Gevaert. These blank cassettes were available as both 90 minutes and 120 minutes of running time. A DC 90 blank cassette cost 12 DM, and a DC 120 blank cassette 15 DM.Zeitschrift „Tonband“, Ausgabe 3/1965 DC-International cassettes were still commercially available a few years after the players' production had been discontinued. Recorded music cassettes were later distributed by Autoplay-Musikkassetten GmbH of Fuerth, Bavaria. Unrecorded cassettes were also produced for several years. An unrecorded DC 90 cassette was later 11 DM, and the DC 120 cassette fetched 14 DM.Zeitschrift „Tonband“, Ausgabe 3/1969 == Cassette machines == Grundig C 100 Several portable cassette tape players were made using transistor technology and for installation in a motor vehicle. As portable devices, the Grundig C 100 was the first cassette tape recorder manufactured by Grundig and a similar model Magnetophon 401 by Telefunken. Both devices are battery powered, though an optional AC adapter was available. The power supply is stored inside the battery compartment and is hidden completely. The sales price of both devices was 298 DM.Grundig History Jahre 1965–1974 http://www.grundig.de/unternehmen/grundig- history/jahre-1965-1974.htmlGrundig Technische Information, Ausgabe September 1965 The Grundig C 100 was later replaced by the 2 slightly revised Grundig C 100 L models and the parallel model of the Grundig C 110 and replaced it later. The Grundig C 110 can be operated on electric power only - no portable options were available.Zeitschrift „Tonband“, Ausgabe 2/1967 For cars which did not feature a built-in radio, the Grundig AC 50 was able to connect to an existing radio head unit. The Grundig AC 60 contained a built-in 5-watt amplifier, as well as a volume and tone control. This model had no radio receiver uncoated into it, though Blaupunkt released 2 models of car tape recorders - identical to the Grundig models, as they were manufactured by Grundig. All built-in devices are only capable of playback.Grundig Technische Information, Ausgabe September 1965 == Discontinuation == Comparison of the Compact Cassette to the DC-International After just two years, the DC- International system was discontinued in favor of the Compact Cassette. At the 1967 Hannover Exhibition Telefunken announced it was ending support for the format, followed shortly after by Grundig at the 25th Radio Exhibition Berlin (IFA). At IFA, Grundig presented its Grundig C 200, a tape recorder for Compact Cassettes.Grundig History Jahre 1965–1974 http://www.grundig.de/unternehmen/grundig- history/jahre-1965-1974.htmlZeitschrift „Tonband“, Ausgabe 5/1967 == List of prerecorded cassettes == At the launch of the DC-International, pre-recorded cassettes from Telefunken, Decca, and RCA Victor were available.Grundig Technische Information, Ausgabe September 1965 * TTP 90000 Buntes Nachmittagskonzert * TTP 90001 Gute Fahrt mit Schwung und Rhythmus * TTP 90002 Im Reich der Operette * TTP 90003 Große Marschparade * TTP 90005 Musikalische Rundreise * DTP 90006 Singen, Lachen, Tanzen * TTP 90007 Melodie und Rhythmus * TTP 90009 Drei Meisteroperetten * TTP 90010 Cocktails For Two * TTP 90011 Erinnern Sie sich? * DTP 90012 In der kleinen Bar * DTP 90013 The Fantastic Rolling Stones * DTP 90014 Durchs deutsche Heimatland * DTP 90015 Musik für dich * DTP 90016 Große Stars – große Erfolge * DTP 90017 Tanzen und Singen mit Catrin, Silvio und Vico * DTP 90018 Die große Musical Show * DTP 90020 Zauberwelt der Melodien * DTP 90021 Jetzt geht’s los * RTP 90022 Western Saloon * RTP 90023 Teenager Melodie * RTP 90024 America’s Favourite Bands * TTP 90025 Bunt gemischt * DTP 90026 Die schlagen ein * TTP 90027 Mal dies – mal das == External links == * Techmoan: DC International & the forgotten audio cassette format war, YouTube, 19 March 2019 * Grundig C 100, Grundig C 100 L, and Grundig C 110 at the radiomuseum.org * Telefunken Magnetophon 401 at the radiomuseum.org * Grundig AC 50 Grundig AC 60 at the radiomuseum.org * Blaupunkt Auto-Tonbandgerät I and Blaupunkt Auto-Tonbandgerät II at the radiomuseum.org == References == Category:Audio storage Category:Tape recording Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1965 Category:Information technology in Germany Category:Science and technology in Germany Category:Discontinued media formats Category:Products introduced in 1967 Category:1965 in music Category:Pages with unreviewed translations ","title":"DC-International"},{"id":"60286561","text":"Ali Lotfi or Aly Lotfi may refer to: * Ali Lotfi (film director), Iranian film director, film producer, and animator * Ali Lotfi (footballer) (born 1989), Egyptian footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Al Ahly in the Egyptian Premier League * Aly Lotfy Mahmoud (1935–2018), Egyptian politician who served as Prime Minister of Egypt from in 1985 and 1986 ","title":"Ali Lotfi"},{"id":"60286620","text":"Wateree is an unincorporated community in Richland County, in the U.S. state of South Carolina. ==History== A post office called Wateree was established in 1852, and remained in operation until 1963.

On three consecutive occasions, during the presidential elections in 2006, 2011 and 2016, the party fielded retired Colonel Doctor Kizza Besigye, as the party's flag-bearer against the ruling National Resistance Movement's candidate, General Yoweri Kaguta Museveni. Dr Besigye lost the contest, on each occasion. In 2017, Patrick Oboi Amuriat won the FDC presidency against the then-party president, retired Major General Gregory Mugisha Muntu, in hotly contested elections that were allegedly characterised by character assassination and verbal attacks to the person of General Muntu as well as insults, tribal and degrading statements against the person of Patrick Amuriat Oboi by the Muntu team. In this election, Amuriat polled 641 votes against 463 votes for Muntu. ==Formation of ANT== The November 2017 election of Patrick Amuriat split the FDC into two camps, one that supported a confrontational and defiance approach to the regime led by Gen. Yoweri Museveni (supported by Amuriat) and the other that supported non- confrontational institutional approach (supported by Muntu). In September 2018, Mugisha Muntu and his supporters quit the FDC party to form a new party. His main objective in the new party is to build grass-roots party structures, encourage more members to run for parliamentary seats and in local elections as well as working in coalition with like minded opposition forces, namely People Power (Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu aka Bobi Wine), the Democratic Party Bloc (Norbert Mao) and JEEMA (Asuman Basalirwa) with the aim of putting forward a single joint candidate to compete in the 2021 presidential elections to oust the Museveni, who has been in power since the overthrow of the democratically elected President Milton Obote after a protracted Bush War that used child soldiers and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Ugandan civilians. Later the same month, Muntu announced that he had begun the process of forming the new party, under the code name New Formation. In March 2019, the Electoral Commission of Uganda, approved the political party, opening the way for gazetting and opening of offices in the future. Ms Alice Alaso, a former member of Parliament for Serere District Wmen Constituency and former Vice President of FDC for the Eastern Region of Uganda, is one of the promoters of the new party. It was officially launched at the Serena Kampala Hotel, in an event attended by Members of Parliament, heads of political parties, civil society organizations and the academia. Those present at the launch included Kyadondo East MP Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, Democratic Party (DP) president Norbert Mao, Uganda People’s Congress (UPC) President Jimmy Akena, the Conservative Party’s Ken Lukyamuzi, former leaders of Opposition Winifred Kiiza and Prof Morris Ogenga Latigo, Arua Municipality MP Kassiano Wadri and Bugweri County MP Abdu Katuntu, among others. The Party unveiled its official symbol, a lighting bulb, its colours (white, purple, and orange) and a logo: a map of Uganda lit with a bulb in the middle. On 7th July 2020, Jinja East MP Paul Mwiru and Ntungamo Municipality MP Gerald Karuhanga announced that they had crossed the floor and joined The Alliance for National Transformation (ANT). The two were unveiled by the principal and presidential aspirant, party flag bearer for the 2021 presidential elections, Gen Mugisha Muntu. ==Leaders== ===The Interim Committee=== ===National Coordinators=== National Coordinator: – Major Gen.

Moragne Davis; 1815–1903) was an American diarist, and an author of romantic fiction, poetry, and religious topics. ==Early years and education== Mary Elizabeth Moragne was born in 1815, at Oakwood, in Abbeville District, South Carolina. Her father, Isaac, Moragne, was a planter. Her mother was Margaret Blanton Caine Moragne. There were ten younger siblings, including brothers, John Moragne and William C. Moragne. Moragne is descended, on the paternal side, from the French Huguenots who sought religious freedom in the United States in 1764. That portion of the colony which did not remain in Charleston, South Carolina found refuge on the banks of Little River, in that district, where they formed a township after the manner of the country which they had left. Her connection with, and proximity to this settlement, gave inspiration to Moragne, and in the introduction to an unfinished story once contemplated on this subject, she gave a brief history of this settlement. Among these settlers was Pierre Moragne, her grandfather, who, having lost his wife on the passage round by Plymouth, returned to Charleston from New Bordeaux, and married Cecille Bayle, a beautiful “compagnon-du-voyage.” As his letters and journals testify, he was from his youth addicted to literary pursuits, and though the wants of a primitive settlement could not have been very favourable to such inclinations, he is remembered and spoken of as a character of great eccentricity, on account of having devoted the latter years of his life to writing. His writings were not appreciated by his immediate descendants; and of the many manuscripts which he left, prepared for publication, only a few remain. The youngest of his four sons, who inherited much of his philosophic and eccentric temperament, was the father of Miss Moragne. On the other side, her maternal grandmother claimed descent from the Randolphs of Roanoke. Moragné grew up on her father's small plantation, Oakwood, near the French Huguenot settlement, New Bordeaux. She attended neighborhood schools and local female seminaries, but she was mostly self- educated, having acquired a knowledge of some of the sciences and of the French language mainly by her own efforts. An avid reader and writer from an early age, she began keeping a journal in 1834. ==Career== \\"The British Partisan\\", her first publication, appeared, as a prize story, in the Augusta Mirror, in 1838. It was well received, adding greatly to the extension of the periodical, besides being reprinted in book form. In 1839, soon after the publication of her first effort in novel-writing, she attached herself to the Presbyterian church at Willington, South Carolina in which she had been brought up, under the care of the Rev. Dr. Waddel. She experienced at the same time a change of views in regard to the propriety of that branch of literature which she had adopted -romantic fiction- and finally, after a few more efforts, some of which were never published, she resolved to end writing in this form, though it had been her favorite pursuit. In 1841, appeared the \\"Rencontre\\", a short story, embracing revolutionary incidents. Of this story, Mr. Thompson, the editor of the Augusta Mirror, remarked as follows:—“The ‘Rencontre’ is of that class of literary productions which we prize above all other orders of fiction. Illustrative as it is of our own history, descriptive of our own peculiar scenery, and abounding in sound reflections and truly elevated sentiment, we hold it worth volumes of the mawkish romance and sickly sentimentality which has of late become a merchantable commodity with a great portion of the literary world.” About this time appeared also some smaller pieces, both in prose and verse. One of the latter was called \\"Joseph, a Scripture sketch, in three parts\\", comprising more than a thousand lines of blank verse. Near the close of the year 1841, the editor of the Augusta Mirror stated:—“We have received the first part of a tale, entitled \\"The Walsingham Family, or, A Mother’s Ambition\\", by a favourite lady correspondent. We are much pleased with it, and judging from past efforts of the same pen, do not hesitate to promise our readers a rich treat.” This was a domestic tale of some length, apparently designed to illustrate the folly and vanity of a worldly and ambitious mother; but although the first six chapters were in the hands of the publisher, and the remainder nearly ready for publication, it was, for the reasons before-mentioned, entirely withdrawn, notwithstanding the earnest solicitation of the editors into whose hands it had passed. In 1842, she married Dr. Waddel's successor, the Rev. William Hervey Davis, and removed with him the following year to Mount Carmel, South Carolina, in the vicinity of the same church. She died in Talladega, Alabama, 1903, and was buried in that city's Oak Hill Cemetery. ==Selected works== * The British partizan : a Revolutionary War tale, 1838 * Mrs. Rebecca Motte, 1877 * Lays from the sunny lands, 1888 * The neglected thread a journal from the Calhoun community, 1836-1842 ==Awards== * First Prize, \\"The British Partizan\\", a short historical romance, 1838, Augusta Mirror == References == ===Attribution=== * * ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * Category:1815 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Pseudonymous writers Category:Pseudonymous women writers Category:Abbeville County, South Carolina Category:19th-century American writers Category:19th-century American women writers Category:19th-century American short story writers Category:American romantic fiction writers Category:19th-century American poets Category:American religious writers Category:Writers from South Carolina ","title":"Mary Elizabeth Moragne"},{"id":"60286911","text":"Reverend Monsignor Eugene Boyle (July 28, 1921 – May 24, 2016) was an American Roman Catholic priest and activist based in California. He became known in the 1960s and 1970s for supporting the Civil Rights Movement as well as left-wing political groups such as the United Farm Workers and the Black Panther Party. He was the first Catholic clergyman to run for the Legislature in California history, despite opposition from within the Catholic hierarchy. == Early life == Eugene was born in San Francisco on July 28, 1921. He attended Saint John's School in San Francisco, Saint Joseph's College Seminary in Mountain View and Saint Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, and was ordained by Archbishop John J. Mitty on June 15, 1946. After ordination, Father Boyle served in parishes in San Francisco and Livermore, eventually becoming Pastor of Sacred Heart Parish in San Francisco by the late 1960s. In 1956, he became the host of his own radio show on KCBS, entitled \\"Underscore: Catholic Views in Review\\", described as \\"an adult show voicing the dialogue of religion and modern life\\" and discussed topics such as church-state relations, the Civil Rights Movement and Social Justice. The show lead to Boyle gaining the reputation of \\"San Francisco's leading liberal Catholic intellectual\\". == Early Activism in the Civil Rights Movement== Boyle became politically active, as many priests in that time were, after being influenced by the Second Vatican Council of the early 1960s, which encouraged Catholics to actively engage themselves in the world. In 1962, Boyle was recruited to become Chaplain of the Archdiocese of San Francisco's \\"Catholic Interracial Council\\", a group dedicated to promoting harmony between the black and white communities in San Francisco. The work of the CIC was considered important and contemporary by the Church in the 1960s; beyond the national debate that had emerged from the Civil Rights Movement, the Black population of San Francisco had risen from just 4,846 around 1940 to a considerable 74,000 in 1960.Burns (1995), Page 4 With this sudden increase in population, racial tensions had risen in the area. The work of the CIC brought Boyle into the Civil Rights movement itself, although he admitted himself that he was reluctant to do so at first out of the shame of breaking social norms in America; Boyle's involvement in the Civil Rights Movement saw him march with Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 at a protest around San Francisco City Hall, in response to Civil Rights leaders including King being targeted by a bomb while staying at a hotel in Alabama. However, as Boyle was further pulled into interracial dialogue and public life, the more comfortable he became with it. Along with the CIC, He campaigned for \\"fair housing\\" in San Francisco, working to fight the , which allowed white real estate sellers to discriminated against \\"coloured\\" people. Boyle was able to rally the Catholic Bishops of San Francisco against the proposed law, who then came out and vocally condemned it, but despite these efforts, it was still voted into law.Burns (1995), Page 8 While the Bill was later ruled unconstitutional, Boyle was highly disappointed by the public, feeling that the bill was clearly immoral. Despite losing the vote, Boyle was still spurred to fight for civil rights. The campaign against the Fair Housing Act had seen him made chairperson of the newly established San Francisco Archdiocesan Commission on Social Justice, further augmenting his authority to speak and tackle social justice issues in San Francisco. Furthermore, the campaign had also brought together a coalition of various religious group from around the city that Boyle could harness to fight for civil rights. == The Little Kerner Report == In 1965, Boyle joined Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in Selma, Alabama for the Selma to Montgomery marches. That same year he also joined up with Cesar Chavez on a protest march from Delano to Sacramento, which was the beginnings of the Delano grape strike. In the years to come Boyle would become an important ally to Chavez and the United Farm Workers labour movement. In 1968 and 1969 Boyle would face back-to-back controversies that would see him pitted in arguments against his superiors in the Catholic hierarchy. The first controversy was the \\"little Kerner Report\\". 1968 the Kerner Commission published a report on the cause of the riots of the Long, hot summer of 1967. It concluded that racism was the ultimate cause of the riots. The report caused enormous controversy across the United States of America for the starkness of the language used to express its findings. In the wake of the findings of the Kerner Report, the San Francisco Conference on Race, Religion, and Social Concerns (SFCRRSC) asked Boyle and seminaries working under him to create a report in a similar vein, examining the conditions of the Black Community in San Francisco. What Boyle had intended to be a 40-page report became a 600-page titan entitled \\"San Francisco: City in Crisis\\" and became nicknamed the \\"Little Kerner Report\\". In its findings, the report contained not just criticism of the wider white power structure in San Francisco, but also levelled criticism against Churches and Synagogues in San Francisco. The SFCRRSC lead a press conference to announce the publishing of the report and report became front-page news in the City and caused massive controversy.Burns (1995), Page 10, 11 Despite praising his effort, San Francisco Major Joseph Alioto denounced the report, calling it \\"inflammatory and ill-conceived\\". What partially alarmed and infuriated the establishment in San Francisco was that the report suggested a race riot could be imminent in the city. Archbishop Joseph Thomas McGucken, Boyle's direct religious superior, publicly supported the report when it was published. However, two months after the report came out, Boyle was moved to a new, predominantly African-American parish. Then the following year McGucken cancelled Boyle's yearly seminar, privately fearing the seminarians were becoming too political. == Working with the Black Panther Party & and the Coloring Book Scandal == Boyle's new parish was roughly in the Western Addition neighbourhood of San Francisco, which was predominantly African-American. Through working and engaging with the community, Boyle came into contact with the Black Panther Party, who had originated just over the Golden Gate Bridge in Oakland. Boyle seemed to be aware of the controversy around Panthers but believed they had been misrepresented in the press. What primarily interested Boyle was the Panthers' social works, such as their free Breakfast for Children Programme, in which members of the Party would provide food for underprivileged children before the school day started. Boyle also believed that isolating a movement such as the Panthers would only further back them into a corner.Burns (1995), Page 15 It was with Boyle's permission that the Black Panthers set up their Free Breakfast programme at Sacred Heart School in the Parish. It was not until many months later that Sacred Heart and Boyle would be swept up with the Panthers in the Black Panther Coloring Book Scandal. In 1968 San Francisco Police Officer Ben Lashkoff appeared before a Senate Committee and stated that he had discovered a Black Panther Coloring book, aimed at the children who came for breakfast, which encouraged them to commit violence against the police. Lashkoff contended that Boyle was aware of the book, and allowed it to be distributed at Sacred Heart. The news story became front-page news in San Francisco and once again the establishment looked in fury towards Boyle. Boyle fully stood by the Panthers, refusing to end the Breakfast programme and declared that at most 2 books had ever been handed out, and once he was made aware of the book he had immediately forbid it. Boyle also claimed no more than 25 copies of the book could ever have been created. Finally, he declared the book was highly suspect to begin with, as it did not reflect the views of the Black Panthers.Burns (1995), Page 17 Boyle's stern defence of the Panthers was met with outrage from the white public, who demanded his resignation. Archbishop McGucken was put under considerable pressure to censure Boyle. However, despite his own feelings on the matter, McGucken refused to do so. It was only years later in 1975 that Boyle, The Panthers and the American Public at large became aware of COINTELPRO, a dedicated unit of the FBI that had been directed by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to destroy the Black Panther's reputation by smearing their name in any way possible. It has been suggested that the \\"Black Panther Coloring Book\\" was a deliberate invention of the FBI designed to turn the white community against the Black Panthers.Clay Mansfield, O. (2019). On Story Ground: The Catholic Interracial Council in the Archdiocese of San Francisco. PhD. University of Virginia. == Archbishop McGucken ends Boyle's Seminary == In the wake of the Little Kerner Report and the Coloring Book affair, yet more controversy would be in store for Fr. Boyle and Archbishop McGurken. In an attempt to pull back from politics, McGucken decided that he would not give his permission for Boyle to run his seminary as he had done in 1968, looking to avoid any repeat of the Little Kerner Report. However, when supporters of Boyle became aware of this, the reaction was quite aggravated. The Monitor, a local newspaper in San Francisco sympathetic to Boyle, lead with the headline \\"Father Boyle fired from College post\\". The narrative that McGurken had fired Boyle based on his social views emerged in many quarters and this drew negative commentary. The pressure built up so much it boiled over into the Archbishop being confronted by a community group of 150 people headed up by a local Black Methodist pastor, Rev. Cecil Williams, on the steps of his own Chancery building, demanding that the Archbishop explain himself. Archbishop McGucken suggested he had not fired Boyle because of his social views, nor was it because of personal animosity. The crowd, however, was not pleased with this explanation and heckled and jeered the Archbishop. Shaken by the confrontation, McGucken agreed to put his actions up for review by the San Francisco Priest's Senate, promising to stand by their decision on the matter. The move made national headlines as it was almost unprecedented for a Catholic Archbishop to allow a challenge to his authority of this sort or to cede his authority in this way. As there was no precedent in Canon law for a process of this nature, it took some time for things to progress.Burns (1995), Page 20 In December 1969, the committee responsible for reviewing McGucken came to their conclusion. They used language so ambiguous in meaning that the San Francisco Chronicle announced the committee had found in favour of Boyle, while the San Francisco Examiner proclaimed \\"Priests vindicate SF Archbishop\\". The committee found that McGucken had not acted on racial bias, citing his good works in favour of interracial community relations, but that Boyle could be reinstated to the Seminary following discussion with McGucken.Burns (1995), Page 21 == Later Work and Life== 1973, Boyle became Director of Field Education at the Jesuit School of Theology at the University of Berkley. In 1974, Boyle ran for California State Assembly, seeking to represent the 16th district, located in San Francisco. Despite a chronic lack of funding, Boyle was able to secure 45% of the vote. For the rest of his life and career, Boyle remained in projects based around Social Justice, although never again courted the controversy he earned during the 60s and 70s. In 2000, Pope John Paul II approved giving Boyle the honorary title of monsignor. ==References== Category:1921 births Category:2016 deaths Category:20th-century American Roman Catholic priests Category:Activists for African-American civil rights Category:Catholics from California Category:COINTELPRO targets Category:History of Catholicism in the United States Category:Religious leaders from the San Francisco Bay Area ","title":"Eugene Boyle"},{"id":"60286937","text":"The 2019 Open Harmonie mutuelle was a professional tennis tournament played on hard courts.

He obtained in 1883 the Burdett Coutts University Scholarship in Geology. Having won an Open Entrance Scholarship, he began in 1885 his clinical training at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College, where he learned bacteriology from Emanuel Edward Klein and pathology from Alfred Antunes Kanthack. In 1887 Andrewes graduated there BM (Oxon.) and qualified MRCS. At St Bartholomew's Hospital he was house physician to James Andrew and completed his medical education by a brief course of study in Vienna. Upon his return from Vienna Andrewes was appointed casualty physician at St Bartholomew's Hospital and later tutor in practical medicine. He was also assistant physician and pathologist to the Royal Free Hospital. He qualified MRCP in 1889. In 1891 he graduated DPH (Cantab). In the 1890s he graduated MD (Oxon.). In 1894 he was appointed assistant demonstrator of practical medicine as successor to Archibald Garrod. In 1897 the joint appointments of pathologist and lecturer on pathology at St Bartholomew's Hospital became vacant when Kanthack was appointed to the chair of pathology at the University of Cambridge. Andrewes succeeded him in these posts and continued in office for thirty years. In 1912 Andrewes's lectureship in pathology was raised by the University of London to a professorship. He did research on the classification of streptococci, the histology of lymphadenoma, immunology, and arterial degeneration. Horder, as well as John Hannah Drysdale, Hugh Thursfield, Frank Atcherley Rose, and W. Girling Ball, were, early in their careers, demonstrators in pathology under Andrewes.

His father, Lucien Lee Kinsolving, was a missionary bishop in Brazil who helped establish the Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil. His mother was Alice Brown. During WWI he served as an ambulance driver with the French Army and later with the United States Army. He also became a first lieutenant and was later awarded the French Croix de Guerre. After the war, he graduated from the University of Virginia in 1917 and then from Virginia Theological Seminary from where he gained his Bachelor of Divinity in 1924. ==Ordained ministry== Kinsolving was ordained deacon in 1924 and priest in 1925. He served as assistant minister at the Church of St Paul of the University of Virginia from 1924 till 1927. Later he became chaplain at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. Between 1933 ans 1940 he served as Dean of the Cathedral of the Incarnation in Garden City, New York. ==Episcopacy== Kinsolving was elected Missionary Bishop of Arizona in 1945 and was consecrated on May 29, 1945, by Presiding Bishop Henry St. George Tucker. In 1959, after the Missionary District of Arizona was established as the Diocese of Arizona, he became its first diocesan bishop. He retired a dew years later in 1962. He died on June 15, 1965, in Carmel, California. ==Family== In addition to his father being a bishop, Kinsolving's uncle, George Herbert Kinsolving, his father's half brother, was the second Bishop of Texas. He married Edith Wharton and together had three sons. One of his sons, Arthur Barksdale Kinsolving III, died after an accident at the age of eighteen on January 22, 1948. ==References== Category:1884 births Category:1964 deaths Category:Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America ","title":"Arthur B.

The shows served as the year-end finale for EMLL before Arena México, EMLL's main venue, closed down for the winter for renovations and to host Circo Atayde . The shows replaced the regular Super Viernes (\\"Super Friday\\") shows held by EMLL since the mid-1930s. Records indicate that 1989 was the first year that EMLL used the name \\"Jucio Final\\" for their show, a name they would use on a regular basis going forward. The main event of the show was a Luchas de Apuestas, or bet match, which is considered a higher profile match type than a championship match in Lucha Libre. The main event of the December 1 Juicio Final show was a Relevos Suicidas (\\"Suicide Relay\\") tag team match where All Star and El Hijo del Santo defeated Fuerza Guerrera and Rocky Star. As a result of their loss, Fuerza Guerrera and Rocky Star had to wrestle for their masks, which Fuerza Guerra won, forcing Rocky Star to unmask and reveal his real name, Federico Ramírez Ibarra, per lucha libre traditions. The other featured match on the show saw El Dandy successfully defend the Mexican National Middleweight Championship against Emilio Charles Jr. two falls to one. The December 1st show included three additional matches. Three main event competitors who survived the December 1 show with their masks intact had to face off in the main event of the December 8 Juicio Final. Fuerza Guerra, El Hijo del Santo and All Star competed in individual matches against each other, where the first wrestler to win two matches would not have to put his mask on the line. With victories over both Hijo del Santo and All Star, Fuerza Guerra watches as El Hijo del Santo then pinned All Star in the last match of the night. After the loss All Star unmasked and revealed his real name, Cesar Antonio Amezcua Muñoz, as a result of his loss. In the second match of the night US wrestler Fabuloso Blondy defeated Pirata Morgan to win the NWA World Light Heavyweight Championship. The December 8 show featured one additional match. ==Production== ===Background=== For decades Arena México, the main venue of the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), would close down in early December and remain closed into either January or February to allow for renovations as well as letting Circo Atayde occupy the space over the holidays. As a result CMLL usually held a \\"end of the year\\" supercard show on the first or second Friday of December in lieu of their normal Super Viernes show. 1955 was the first year where CMLL used the name \\"El Juicio Final\\" (\\"The Final Judgement\\") for their year-end supershow. Until 2000 the Jucio Final name was always used for the year end show, but since 2000 has at times been used for shows outside of December. It is no longer an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All Juicio Final shows have been held in Arena México in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". ===Storylines=== The 1989 Juicio Final show featured five professional wrestling matches scripted by EMLL with some wrestlers involved in scripted feuds. The wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that play the part of the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (técnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they perform. ==Results December 1, 1989== ==Results December 8, 1989== ==References== Category:1989 in Mexican sports Category:1989 in professional wrestling Category:CMLL Juicio Final Category:Sport in Mexico ","title":"Juicio Final (1989)"},{"id":"60287326","text":"This is a list of NUTS-2 regions in EU which have a Gross domestic product over €100 billion.

The brand curates a collection of social media interactions between celebrities, emphasizing lighthearted interactions while trying to humanize celebrities. The account gained popularity through Instagram, although they also have Twitter, and Facebook accounts. ==Background== Comments by Celebs was co-founded by Diamond and Kramer in April 2017. At the time, Instagram had recently changed its algorithm so that comments from verified accounts were visible first. This led Kramer and Diamond to create an Instagram account featuring a variety of comments and social media interactions between celebrities. Comments by Celebs' popularity grew after Kelly Ripa mentioned the account on the air on her show Live with Kelly and Ryan. In early 2018, they also added a watermark to their posts, which they claim helped to grow the account. The company is based in New York City and Kramer and Diamond work out of the WeWork spaces in the city. Their account has also become a source of entertainment news due to the fact that they capture and instantly release information about which celebrities are interacting with one another. Because of this, they have built relationships with several entertainment reporters and celebrities, and many gossip bloggers have featured work from the accounts. To maintain positive relationships with celebrities, they request permission to post comments that may be considered questionable. As a result of the popularity, they started various spinoff accounts with the handles @CommentsByBravo, @CommentsByBachelor, @CommentsByAthletes, @CommentsByInfluencers, and @CommentsByTikTok. While Kramer and Diamond run most of the accounts themselves, they hired someone to run @CommentsbyAthletes. Diamond and Kramer are alumnae of Syracuse University, where they met and were in the same sorority. They bonded through a group chat which discussed Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Diamond holds a bachelor's degree in communications and rhetorical studies, while Kramer holds a Bachelors in psychology. At the time the account started, Diamond was pursuing a Masters in Social Work at Columbia University and Kramer was also planning on attending graduate school, but after the account's popularity grew, they deferred to pursue Comments by Celebs full-time. Both women are Jewish. Comments by Celebs was named as an honoree in the 2019 Webby Awards. On June 2, 2019, Kramer and Diamond launched a Patreon account. Subscribers pay for a membership which provides access to bonus episodes of the podcast, a Facebook group, and behind the scenes information about the company. ==Podcast== Diamond and Kramer's podcast began in July 2018 as a partnership with Betches, with their first episode airing on July 10, 2018, and featuring Kelly Ripa as a guest host. Other occasional celebrity guest hosts have included Katie Couric, Lisa Rinna, and Gary Janetti. In January 2019 they left Betches and partnered with Cadence13. The podcast generally consists of five sections: weekly celebrity news, a comments award ceremony, a Kardashian update, and sometimes a Q&A; or game. ===Kardashian bonus episodes=== In February 2019, they started releasing weekly bonus podcast episodes which focus on the stars of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. The episodes discuss Kardashian news, scandals, and past and current episodes of the reality show. They covered the Jordyn Woods and Tristan Thompson scandal on the podcast through a series of episodes which they named \\"JORDYNGATE\\" and which began trending on the Apple podcast app. ==List of episodes== ===Main episodes=== ====Kardashian bonus episodes==== ====Bravo bonus episodes==== ==References== ==External links== Category:Instagram accounts Category:Social media accounts Category:Audio podcasts Category:2018 podcast debuts Category:Comedy and humor podcasts Category:Internet properties established in 2017 Category:2017 establishments in New York City Category:American entertainment websites ","title":"Comments by Celebs"},{"id":"60287395","text":"Nelda is a given name.

K-214 was first designated a state highway on December 13, 1961, to connect Hoyt to a new alignment of US-75, that was built to the west of the city. ==Route description== K-214 begins at an intersection with US-75 and travelers east for roughly and intersects West First Street, also known as Rural Secondary 318 (RS-318), at the Hoyt city limits. At this point it turns north and travels approximately then intersects West 4th Street, which is the former routing of US-75. It then continues north for about , curves to the west and intersects 118th Road. From here it continues west for roughly and reaches its northern terminus back at US-75. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 825 vehicles near the northern terminus to 1980 vehicles near the southern terminus. K-214 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-214 does connect to the National Highway System at each end. The section of the route within the Hoyt city limits is paved with full design bituminous pavement and the remaining portions are paved with partial design bituminous pavement. ==History== ===Early roads=== Before state highways were numbered in Kansas there were Auto trails, which were an informal network of marked routes that existed in the United States and Canada in the early part of the 20th century. The section of K-214 that runs north- south through Hoyt was part of the Capitol Route and Omaha-Topeka Trail. ===Establishment=== Originally US-75 traveled through the city of Hoyt. Then in a December 13, 1961 resolution, US-75 was realigned between Topeka and Hoyt. At that time, K-214 was created to link Hoyt to the new US-75 west of the city.

The memoir describes her life from the age of nine to adulthood. In this memoir, she narrates the consequences of the disease in her emotional life as well as the physical implications that it had on her face, which resulted in a lifetime of self-consciousness. When interviewed about the novel in 1994 by Charley Rose, the author explained that the books principal theme was identity. The novel was first published in 1994, and a renamed British edition was released in 1995 under the name In the Minds Eyes. == Plot summary == The prologue introduces the reader to Lucy's struggle with self-image. She describes her work at the stable Diamond D, which was her first job after finishing chemotherapy. Through this first narration, Lucy introduces her family's situation both emotionally and financially. Moreover, she begins talking about the stares that she received from children which she did not know if they were better than the hidden looks from adults. Lucy brings the reader back with flashbacks of fourth grade. Being a tomboyish girl, she would play with boys and participate in dares. However, one day during physical education she bumps into Joni Friedman's head. Later at night, while doing her homework she feels a toothache and thinks that this would be her way to get out of going to school the next day. While her mother worries, her father tells her that it's just a toothache. However, the next day when she visits the dentist, she receives her first diagnosed as having fractured her jaw. Nevertheless, after performing an X-ray, she is told that she had a dental cyst and that she needed emergency surgery. She thoroughly describes her operation and her experience with anesthesia and says that back to school she felt like a warrior for experiencing something the other kids hadn't. Six months after her operation, “a bony knob” had appeared at the tip of her jaw. Her mother asked the doctor repeatedly about it, but he dismissed her by saying that it was just a \\"bony growth\\". Yet as the situation worsened, she is back at the hospital and undergoes multiple tests, including a bone marrow examination. She is diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma, however, no one describes it to her as cancer until further in the disease which makes her not assimilate the diagnosis as she should. She meets Derek at the hospital and he becomes his partner in mischievous adventures around the hospital. Lucy is scheduled for an operation involving the removal of the right side of her jaw, but she was not aware of the implications that this would have on her life. After the operation, she could sense her families discomfort when visiting because of the way she looked. Lucy starts chemotherapy and experiences pain more than ever. The treatment would make her nauseous and cause vomiting, and as she recovered it was once again time for the treatment. She dreaded Fridays, which were the day for the treatment so much that she tried to get her white blood cell count up so that the treatment could not be administered. Around this time, she starts wondering about the idea of God and she starts realizing how her disease was not only affecting her but also the rest of her family. As a result of the chemotherapy, her hair starts falling off, which brings about another issue for self-esteem. When Lucy returns to school after missing much of fifth grade, boys start bullying her and making fun of her appearance. Later in high school, things get worst and she asks a counselor for help and the only thing he offers is to allow her to eat lunch at his office. During this time, she preferred the pain of chemotherapy than the pain of being bullied. As Lucy's hair grows back, so does her confidence. She starts building new friendships, however, she still carries the weight of feeling that no one would ever love her in a romantic way. At the age of 16, she has her first reconstructive surgery and yet not happy with the results she hopes that the next surgery will truly bring her happiness. However, this process repeats cycles never truly being happy about her looks. In high school, even though no one said anything about her looks, she became her own judge and reminder of what she was lacking. However, what helped her go through all these negative emotions she created for herself was horse riding and reading. She starts to attend Sarah Lawrence College, and feels acceptance for the first time because of how different everyone was. She makes true friends for the first time during college. As she encounters adulthood, being fulfilled with her career and having experienced some romantic relationships, Lucy starts to accept her image as it is and stops waiting for the physical beauty that will make her happy. She claims to have finally become \\"acquainted\\" with her face and feels whole after a long journey of not feeling good about herself. == Characters == * Lucy: She is a girl that suffers from a very uncommon form of Ewing's sarcoma. This disease greatly affects Lucy for the rest of her life. * Lucy's mother ==Reception== Autobiography of a Face has received reviews from Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, and Seventeen Magazine.

He was a member of Voivode Vojislav Tankosić's band (1903-1912). After participating in the Balkan Wars and World War I, he joined the First Serbian Volunteer Division in Odessa and continued fighting against the Bolsheviks in the White movement. https://www.google.com/search?tbs=bks:1&q;=%22Vlada+Voskar%22+-wikipediaThat was the last record of him. As a member of the Serbian Chetnik band, Vlada Voskar and his fellow volunteers were under the command of Vojislav Tankosić, one of the most important Chetnik voivodes at the time. They went to Skopje, Bitola, and Thessaloniki in the winter of 1903–04, where they organized Chetnik action in the struggle for Macedonia.Krakov 1930, pp. 103-104Voskar also participated in the victory on Čelopek near Kumanovo on 16 April 1905, part of the četa (unit) of vojvoda Savatije Milošević. Voskar went to Belgrade after Tankosić disbanded the Chetnik volunteers in late July 1908. Among the first to join the Chetniks in the Balkan Wars, Voskar chose Tankosić's Laplje Chetnik detachment. The detachment began operations in the Turkish-controlled territory two days before the outbreak of the war, at the border post (karaula) at Merdar, where the Chetniks and Albanian Kachaks skirmished into the first battle of the war. The fighting evolved on its own, obviously, without headquarters' approval. Voskar and his comrades at arms fought for three days until the Serbian Army came and brought victory. Tankosić's Chetniks were among the first to liberate Priština from the Ottoman Turks. After the outbreak of World War I, when Jovan Babunski formed the Sava Chetnik detachment, which was then placed under the command of Major Vojislav Tankosić, Voskar's unit went on to fight the Austro-Hungarians in the late summer of 1914 and later destroyed a railway bridge on the Sava River to prevent Austro-Hungarian forces from crossing it. It took the Austrians and the Central Powers three attempts at invading Serbia in late 1915 to reach their goal. During the Serbian army's retreat through Albania, the Montenegrin Army that protected the retreat of Serbian forces defeated the Austrians on 7 January 1916 in the Battle of Mojkovac. This allowed the Serbian army and civilians to reach Corfu and eventually Salonika, where they met up with expeditionary forces from several countries, including France, Italy, Great Britain, Russia, and Greece, the so-called Allied Army of the Orient. In February 1916, the Serbian Supreme Command at Corfu issued a directive to Colonel Stevan Hadžić (appointing him as Commander) to leave for Imperial Russia, in order to form the First Serbian Volunteer Division.Hadžić took several volunteers with him, among them Vlada Voskar, an experienced Chetnik, before leaving for Odessa, they made a stop-over in Iaşi where Voskar joined up with Lieuteant-Colonel Aleksandar Srb,Magarašević, and Pavkovićwho become prominent commanders in the ranks of the First Serbian Volunteer Division and later in the White movement. Voskar went on to fight in Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai, Krasnoyarsk, Tyumen, Tobolsk Kremlin, Novi Nikolaevsk (Novosibirsk) and Vladivostok. The last record we have of him is in Russia during the Russian Civil War. ==See also== * List of Chetnik voivodes == References == * Postcard photo of Vlada T.

One possibility is that the name referred to the roses that grew in grew in the gardens at One . Another possible explanation is that the nobleman Jens Rosengaard may have owned a house there. The low Tvermosegård (No. 12) was for many years operated as a guesthouse. It was replaced by a four-storey building in 1905. Marie Christensen established the Copenhagen Maid's School (Københavns Tjenestepigeskole) at No. 14 in 1907. A restaurant was also operated from the premises. The school was converted into a self- owning institution and relocated to Fensmarksgade 65-67 in 1926. ==Notable buildings== No. 5, No. 6, No. 7 and No. 13 have been listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places. No. 5 and No. 7 were built in 1844-1845 for master saddler J. C. Culmsee. No. 6 was built in 1810-1811 by master carpenter Henrik Tyberg. No. 13 was built in 1850 for destiller N. P. Cadovius, He had in 1840-41 also constructed the neighbouring building at No. 11. ==Public art and memorials== The commemorative plaque at No. 9 commemorates that the illustrator and caricaturist P. C. Klæstrup was born in the building. The plaque was installed in 1958 and features a relief portrait of Klæstrup as well as a relief based on his caricature of Søren Kierkegaard. ==Cultural references== The writer Arthur Abrahams (1836-1905) mentions Tvermoes Gård in his childhood memoirs Minder fra min barndom og tidlige ungdom. ==References== ==External links== * Rosengården at indenforvoldene.dk Category:Streets in Copenhagen ","title":"Rosengården"},{"id":"60287900","text":"Bound for Glory () is a Canadian drama film, directed by Clément Perron and released in 1975.\\"Première du film «Partis pour la gloire»\\".

Weapons featured in Chinese mythology, legend, cultural symbology, and fiction include Guanyu's pole weapon (featured in the 14th century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms). This non-factually documented weapon has been known as the Green Dragon Crescent Blade. Other weapons from Chinese mythology, legend, cultural symbology, and fiction include the shield and battleax of the defiant dancer Xingtian, Yi's bow and arrows, given him by Di Jun, and the many weapons and armor of Chiyou, who is associated with the elemental power of metal. Chinese mythology, legend, cultural symbology, and fiction features the use of elemental weapons such as ones evoking the powers of wind and rain to influence battle. ==Chinese mythology== Chinese mythology refers to mythology that has been passed down in oral or written forms from in the geographic area now known as \\"China\\". Chinese mythology includes many varied myths from regional and cultural traditions. Chinese mythology is far from monolithic, not being an integrated system, even among just Han people. Chinese mythology is encountered in the traditions of various classes of people, geographic regions, historical periods including the present, and from various ethnic groups. China is the home of many mythological traditions, including that of Han Chinese and their Huaxia predecessors, as well as Tibetan mythology, Turkic mythology, Korean mythology, and many others. However, the study of Chinese mythology tends to focus upon material in Chinese language. Like many mythologies, Chinese mythology has in the past been believed to be, at least in part, a factual recording of history. Along with Chinese folklore, Chinese mythology forms an important part of Chinese folk religion (Yang 2005, 4). Many stories regarding characters and events of the distant past have a double tradition: ones which present a more historicized or euhemerized version and ones which present a more mythological version (Yang 2005, 12–13). Many myths involve the creation and cosmology of the universe and its deities and inhabitants. Some mythology involves creation myths, the origin of things, people and culture. Some involve the origin of the Chinese state. Some myths involve a culture hero who used or made and/or taught people how make or use artifacts.(Yang 2005, 5-10) ==Notable users== ===Xingtian=== Xingtian One of figures of classical mythology is Xingtian, a defier of Heaven and a dancing wielder of shield and weapon (Birrell 1993, 216-217). Xingtian's name is also transliterated as \\"Hsing T'ien\\". Xingtian fought against the warrior-god Huangdi (Birrell 1993, 130). Defiant to the last: even after being beheaded, Xingtian carries on, becoming immortal (Birrell 1993, 181). This, despite having his head chopped off, and having to resort to using his nipples for eyes and his navel for a mouth (Birrell 1993, 216-217). Generally, Xingtian's fighting paraphernalia is depicted as a shield and an ax. ===Di Jun and Yi's bow and arrows=== The great archer Yi was given a bow and arrows by Di Jun, in order to dispel the noxious presence of nine of ten over-heating suns (Birrell 1993, 314). Some scholars identify Di Jun and Di Ku as variations from a shared original source (Yang 2005, 100). ===Lü Dongbin=== Immortal Lü Dongbin, painted by Gu Jianlong, first half of 17th century Lü Dongbin had or has a demon-slaying sword, according to legend (Eberhard 1986, 281-282). ===Guan Yu and his glaive=== Sacrificial Rites Martial Temple, Tainan, Taiwan The mighty warrior, later general, and subsequently deified Guan Yu is particularly associated with his glaive weapon, known in China as a yanyuedao, \\"crescent moon blade\\", or as a guandao. Guan's blade-weapon is known as the Green Dragon Crescent Moon Sword or as the Frost Fair Blade, from the idea that during a battle in the snow, the blade continuously had blood on it; the blood froze and made a layer of frost on the blade. According to Chapter 1 of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, the Green Dragon Crescent Blade was said to weigh 82 catties. During the Eastern Han Dynasty and Three Kingdoms periods, one catty was approximately 220 grams, so 82 catties would have been approximately 18 kilograms (~40 pounds). A weapon weighing about 100 pounds (~45 kilograms), purported to be the Green Dragon Crescent Blade, is on display at the Purple Cloud Temple in China today. Despite the weight, Guan Yu was said to have ridden alone for a thousands of miles, carrying his weapon, and to have capably wielded it one-handed, according to the somewhat mythologically-based novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. ===Magical weapons in Journey to the West=== Various weapons appear in Journey to the West, some of interest as part of a mythological legacy. ====Ruyi Jingu Bang==== Ruyi Jingu Bang is a name for the magic staff of Sun Wukong. ====Fly-whisks==== Fly whisks appear as weapons of immense magical potency, especially wielded by Daoists. ==Use in notable battles== ===Battles of Banquan and Zhuolu=== The early mythological battles of China were the battles of Banquan and of Zhuolu. Of the two, the conflict at Zhoulu is the more mythologically replete: both offensive and defensive weapons are described, along with countermeasures. Also, a third battle was held to have been fought between Huangdi and Yandi, as part of the series match-up (Birrell 1993, 132, citing Ta Tai Li chi, Wu ti te, SPTK 7.1b) ====Banquan==== The Battle of Banquan () is the first battle in Chinese history is recorded by Sima Qian's in the Records of the Grand Historian, a major source of both historical and mythological material. It was fought by Huangdi, the Yellow Emperor, and Yandi, the Flame Emperor. ====Zhoulu==== According to the Chinese mythological account Classic of Mountains and Seas, Chiyou, various allies fought against Huangdi at the plain of Zhuolu. Both sides used magical means, but Chi You had the advantage of forged swords and halberds. Using his powers, Chiyou covered the battlefield in thick fog. The Yellow Emperor's troops found their way through the mist with the help of a magical south-pointing chariot. Huangdi used Nüba (also known as Ba or Han Ba), a drought deity, to harm Chiyou's troops by application of weather control as a weapon. Yinglong, the winged dragon, finally defeated Chiyou (Sima Qian, \\"Wǔdì Běnjì\\", Records of the Grand Historian). Yandi Yandi is also known as the Flame Emperor or the Red Emperor. He fought a war with Huangdi which was decided in the Battle of Banquan. The fire with which Yandi is associated seems to have been put to agricultural purposes along the lines of slash-and-burn farming techniques (Wu 1982, 56). In mythology, Yandi uses fire as an elemental weapon, in opposition to the use by Huangdi of water as an elemental weapon (Birrell 1993, 131). Chiyou The mythological Chiyou was supposed to have invented weapons and war, Chiyou's legendary war with Huangdi included enhancing the technology to use of artificial mists and possibly the use of the compass as a countermeasure by Huangdi, and evoking the powers of wind and rain to influence battle (Christie 1968, 90-91). Chiyou is especially associated with the element of metal, using it to form arms and armor (Birrell, 296, and so on). Huangdi Huangdi is also known as the Yellow Emperor, Yellow Thearch, or Xuanyuan, among other names. Well known as a culture hero in Chinese culture, part of the mythology surrounding him involves his martial prowess and the use of mythological arms and apparatus of war. One example is the south-pointing chariot. Another example is the use of water as an elemental weapon (for example, see Birrell 2003, 130-137). ==Made by notable smiths== Sword of Goujian, Hubei Provincial Museum. Magical writing was often accomplished during the making of swords. The makers and origins of weapons and armor is often mythologically important. Examples include the swords and spears originating from Wu (state), such as the sword used to slice open Gun to release his son Yu, or the legendary swords of Gan Jiang and Mo Ye (Birrell 1993, 222). The mythological materials quoted by Birrell from various sources illustrate the dangers associated in mythology with mythological weapons, both their manufacture and their acquisition. ===Ou Yezi=== Ou Yezi was a famous swordsmith, according to Chinese mythology (see Birrell loc. cit. below, and so on). ===Ganjiang and Moxie=== Also known as Kan Chiang and Mo Yeh, Gan Jiang and Mo Xie were a husband and wife pair and eponymous makers of paired swords, with Gan Jiang having studied under Master Smith Ou Yezi, according at least to the Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue (Birrell 1993, 221-227 and 303). Gan-jiang was the male, Mo-xie female. They were sometimes said to have been forged from the liver and kidneys of a metal-eating hare residing in the Kunlun Mountains (Eberhard 1986, 282). ===Famous swords of Chinese legend or mythology=== Various famous swords may be encountered Chinese legend or mythology. Some of these swords also appear in literary fiction; or, various other media, including comics and video games. There are two main types of sword: jian and dao. Swords with estimated or presumed magical powers (or, that were especially well-made) were often designated by the epithet \\"treasure\\" (寶), as is the case with \\"treasure jian\\" (寶劍) and \\"treasure dao (寶刀)\\". Famous sword smiths documented in mythology include Ou Yezi and the husband and wife pair Gan Jiang and Mo Xie. ====Jian==== Jian swords have blades with two edges, longer than what would be considered to be a dagger. Translations into English are mostly provisional. In Chinese mythology, in various sources, associated with much related mythological material, various swords are said to have been forged by Gan Jiang (who studied under Ou Yezi) and Mo Xie (also transliterated as \\"Kan Chiang\\" and \\"Mo Yeh\\"), who were a husband and wife pair and eponymous makers of paired swords (Birrell 1993, 221-224 and 303). Gan-jiang was the male, Mo-xie female (eponymously both swords and smiths). The Gan-jiang and Mo-xie swords were sometimes said to have been forged from the liver and kidneys of a metal-eating hare residing in the Kunlun Mountains (Eberhard 1986, 281-282, sub \\"Sword\\"). Note that just because these swords may be encountered in mythology does not mean that they never existed historically. ==Various types== ===Demon-slaying weapons=== Some of the weapons most commonly wielded against demons were made of peach-wood, such as the either actually made or made according to mythology peach-wood bows actually or mythologically wielded to shoot down mythologically, superstitiously, or religiously conceived or believed demons (Eberhard 1986, 228). Birrell (1993, 103) cites the following: > \\"Club\\" is the large stick that he [ Feng Meng, that is ] made of peach wood > to batter Yi to death with. From that time on demons are terrified of > peachwood. (Hsu Shen's commentary on Huai-nan Tzu, Ch'ian yen, SPPY 14.1b) ==Sources== There are many sources for information on arms and armor in Chinese mythology. These sources range from literature to oral sources and from classical times to modern times. Mythological gems may be embedded in the matrix of histories, such as Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian or located somewhere in the mythological landscapes of the Classic of Mountains and Seas. Besides the Chinese sources and their translations, a mythological studies oriented literature in English has been an actively growing field. ==See also== ===General information=== *:Category:Weapons of China *Chinese armour *Chinese swords *Chinese martial arts *Chinese mythology *Dao (sword) *Gun (staff) *Ji (polearm) *Jian: general article about double-edged straight sword used during the last 2,500 years in China. *List of Chinese wars and battles *List of magical weapons *Qiang (spear) ===Other information=== *Green Dragon Crescent Blade *Hymn to the Fallen (Jiu Ge) *Jiutian Xuannü *Leigong *Mr. He's jade *South-pointing chariot *Thunderbolt *Wu xing *Yinglong *Xuan- Yuan Sword: a video game series. ==References cited== *Birrell, Anne (1993).

The nationality laws were only in rough form from about 1913 to 1923, taking more definite form in 1924. There were several major changes in the nationality law, especially in 1931, 1938, and 1978. Soviet law originally expanded the bounds of jus sanguinis and citizenship by residence more than was common among European countries, before tending to gradually retract from that over time. Soviet citizenship law was also used as a political tool to expand the number of Soviet citizens globally, increase military conscription pools, and punish dissenters or even entire ethnic groups. ==Early situation on citizenship== After the Russian Revolution, between 1917 and 1923, citizenship and nationality questions were subject to the control of various bodies in the \\"numerous independent and semi-independent republics and regions.\\" Earlier leaders did not focus on nationality law, because they believes that an ongoing worldwide Communist revolution would eventually join all person on the world into one larger Communist citizenship. The 1918 constitution of the Russian SFSR did not draw a clear distinction between citizens and non- citizens, instead simply extending rights of Russian citizens to non-citizens within the Russian Republic. While residents of the Russian Empire were initially welcomed by the government to return, after the Russian Civil War, the Bolshevik party leadership engaged in mass denaturalization of Russians who had left. The 1923 USSR constitution established a single uniform USSR citizenship for all citizens of the SSRs. It was not until October 29, 1924 that the first comprehensive citizenship law or regulations came into effect in the USSR, making it difficult to determine citizenship status until then. The first comprehensive Soviet law on citizenship, in 1924, established USSR citizenship, status of foreigners, citizenship at birth, citizenship effect on children of their parents, and naturalization. A 1930 revision modified a few details. It also greatly expanded the power to denaturalize citizens. ==First comprehensive laws== The \\"Statute on Citizenship of the Union of the S.S.R. of April 22, 1931\\" laid out Soviet laws on citizenship. All citizens of the USSR were also citizens of an SSR, and all citizens of the SSRs were also citizens of the USSR. The citizenship laws of the SSRs were very similar in form and substance to the USSR citizenship laws. Citizenship in the individual SSRs \\"formally existed but had no practical or political consquences\\" because it was subsumed into USSR citizenship. Experts believes that SSR citizenship was largely non-existent. All persons in the USSR were citizens unless proved to be citizen of a foreign state. The rule avoids statelessness, and also \\"subject[s] every one who cannot prove his foreign citizenship to the strict surveillance to which all citizens are subjected.\\" It also had the effect of building the potential pool of military recruits for conscription. Any person born of a parent who was a citizen of the USSR was also a citizen of the USSR, which extended the principle of the previous imperial regime. This practice continued through the later Stalin's 1938 \\"On USSR Citizenship\\" law, in order to broaden the number of Soviet citizens. This includes children born outside wedlock. No process of renunciation was given for those living inside the USSR. Marriage to a USSR citizen did not automatically confer citizenship, which was seen as a break from European bourgeois customs. The citizenship of a child under 14 generally changes with the citizenship of the parents, either to or away from USSR citizenship, but did not do so automatically if the parents' citizenships differed, which was also seen as a break from European custom. A Soviet citizenship act number 198 was enacted on August 19, 1938, consisting of only eight articles instead of its predecessor's 29 articles. It was originally designed to replace all earlier Soviet citizenship regulations and laws, until that provision was removed, as it was too terse to provide substantial guidance, so that only conflicting earlier provisions were replaced. The 1938 law no longer stated that all persons in Soviet territory were presumed to be citizens. It created officially stateless persons who did not have Soviet citizenship and could not prove other citizenship. The 1931 act was repealed in 1939. ==Practical application== Details of naturalization in the 1931 law were deliberately kept vague, so as to provide full power to administrative authorizes to decide upon who might be admitted to citizenship. In general, Soviet citizenship law was very inclusive in theory. There were no official requirements for residency; knowledge of language, history, constitution, or political system; minimum income; or the like. All that was required was an application and renunciation of other citizenships, and specifying of a particular SSR citizenship. In the period leading up to the 1938 law, the Soviet political system made strong use of deprivation of citizenship and reinstatement as instrument of discipline and sanction.

Cougar Den, Inc., 586 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Yakama Nation Treaty of 1855 preempts the state law which the State purported to be able to tax fuel purchased by a tribal corporation for sale to tribal members. This was a 5-4 plurality decision, with Justice Breyer's opinion being joined by Justices Sotomayor and Kagan. Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Ginsburg, penned a concurring opinion. There were dissenting opinions by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh. == Background == === Facts of the case === The Yakama Nation is an American Indian tribe in Washington, located on the Yakama Indian Reservation, on the east side of the Cascade Mountains. In 1855, the tribe signed the Yakama Nation Treaty of 1855, ceding approximately 10,000,000 acres to the United States, but reserving important rights for the tribe and its members. In the treaty, the tribe reserved “the right, in common with citizens of the United States, to travel upon all public highways.”Yakama Nation Treaty of 1855, June 9, 1855, ratified Mar. 8, 1859, 12 Stat. 951. Cougar Den, Inc., was a corporation owned by the Yakama Nation, and which imported gasoline onto the reservation for sale to tribal members. The laws of the State of Washington imposed a tax on fuel imported into the state by truck,Wash. Rev. Code § 82.36.020. which the tribe refused to pay. Washington, in 2013, assessed taxes and penalties of $3.6 million dollars against the tribe.Washington State Dep't of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc., No. 16-1498, 586 U.S. ___, slip op. at 3 (2019) (hereinafter cited as Cougar Den); Cougar Den v. State Dep't of Licensing, 392 P.3d 1014, 1015 (Wash., 2017) (hereinafter cited as State Dep't). Cougar Den appealed the assessment. === Procedural history === The matter was first heard by an administrative law judge, who ruled in favor of the tribe, and that the tax was preempted by the treaty.Cougar Den, slip op. at 3; State Dep't, 392 P.3d at 1015; Kate Prengaman, Gas tax fuels debate between Yakama Nation, state, , May 22, 2015, (last visited Mar 24, 2019). The State asked for review, and the Director of the State Department of Licensing reversed, holding that the tribe owed the Department the assessment.Cougar Den, slip op. at 3; State Dep't, 392 P.3d at 1015. Cougar Den then petitioned in the Yakima County Superior Court, which was sitting in an appellate capacity. The Superior Court reversed the Director's decision, holding that the tax was preempted by treaty.Cougar Den, slip op. at 3; State Dep't, 392 P.3d at 1015; Kate Prengaman, Judge's ruling expected to favor treaty rights in gas tax case, , July 22, 2015, (last visited Mar 24, 2019). The Department appealed and the Washington Supreme Court granted direct review. In a 7-2 decision, the Washington Supreme Court affirmed the lower decision, holding that the treaty preempted the state tax.Cougar Den, slip op. at 4; State Dep't, 392 P.3d at 1020. The Department then petitioned the United States Supreme Court, and the Court granted certiorari.Cougar Den, slip op. at 4. == Supreme Court == === Arguments === State Solicitor General Noah Purcell argued the case for the State of Washington. Purcell argued that the taxes merely reached possession of the fuel, not the right to travel.Bethany Berger, Argument analysis: Justices conflicted in clash between fuel tax and Yakama Treaty (2018), (last visited Mar 21, 2019) (hereinafter cited as Berger, Argument analysis). Assistant U.S. Solicitor General Anne O’Connell argued for the United States, supporting the State of Washington. She took the same position as Purcell, that the treaty only guaranteed the tribe the right to use the roads.Berger, Argument analysis. Adam Unikowsky argued the case for the Yakama Nation. Unikowsky argued that the treaty allowed the tribe the right to take its goods to and from the marketplace. He stated that this was a tax on travel with goods, not the possession of the goods.Berger, Argument analysis. === Opinion of the Court === Justice Stephen Breyer, author of the opinion The opinion of the Court was delivered by Associate Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Justice Breyer noted that the Washington tax was not a tax on possession or the importation of fuel, only on the ground transportation of fuel.Cougar Den, slip op. at 6. Therefore, the \\"State must prove that Cougar Den traveled by highway in order to apply its tax.\\"Cougar Den, slip op. at 7 (emphasis in original). He observed that Washington had amended its fuel taxation scheme, after a U.S. District Court had barred the State from taxing fuel on the tribal reservation.Cougar Den, slip op. at 9-10. In addition, Breyer noted that the tribe, at the time they agreed to the treaty, would have understood that they had the \\"right to travel on the public highways included the right to travel with goods for purposes of trade.\\"Cougar Den, slip op. at 14. Since the tax placed a burden on the right of the tribe to travel on the highway with goods, the state law was preempted by the treaty, and the lower decision was affirmed.Cougar Den, slip op. at 18. === Concurring opinion === Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, issued a concurring opinion. In his view, the Court was \\"charged with adopting the interpretation most consistent with the treaty’s original meaning.\\"Cougar Den, slip op. at 1 (J. Gorsuch, concurring). Justice Gorsuch noted that the treaty was written in English, then translated into Chinook (a pidgin language, not the native tongue of the tribe), and the interpretation must be based on how the Yakama Nation understood it at the time of the treaty signing.Cougar Den, slip op. at 2 (J. Gorsuch, concurring). He felt that the tribe believed that the treaty provided them “with the right to travel on all public highways without being subject to any licensing and permitting fees related to the exercise of that right while engaged in the transportation of tribal goods.”Cougar Den, slip op. at 3 (J. Gorsuch, concurring). Justice Gorsuch concluded his opinion with: === Dissenting opinions === Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Brett Kavanaugh dissented. Roberts believed that the State's tax was a tax on the possession of the fuel, not on its transportation.Cougar Den, slip op. at 2 (CJ Roberts, dissenting). In his opinion, the tax would be preempted only if it acted as a toll or a blockade.Cougar Den, slip op. at 2 (CJ Roberts, dissenting). Further to Roberts' dissent, Justice Kavanaugh, joined by Justice Thomas, issued a separate dissent. Justice Kavanaugh stated that the treaty merely allowed tribal members to travel on public highways on the same basis as non-Indian citizens.Cougar Den, slip op. at 1 (J Kavanaugh, dissenting). == See also == *Oklahoma Tax Commission v.

His grandparents having been received into the membership of the Duck Creek Meeting of the Society of Friends, Emerson was brought up in their faith. Through his mother's ambition he began to study medicine when he was sixteen, under one of her cousins, Dr. James Sykes, a surgeon of some note in Dover and one time governor of the state of Delaware. Afterwards he attended medical lectures in Philadelphia. The University of Pennsylvania granted him his M. D. in March, 1816. In 1816, owing to poor health, he moved to and practiced near Montrose, Pennsylvania, but after two years accepted an appointment as surgeon on a merchant ship bound for China. His journal gives detailed account of his voyage and a dramatic account of being held up and robbed by Spanish pirates on the return voyage. When Dr. Emerson returned to America he settled in Philadelphia where a yellow-fever epidemic gave him an opportunity for usefulness which he used so well that he was appointed attending physician to the City Dispensary. The Board of Health being without authority to deal with smallpox as it did with other contagious diseases, Dr. Emerson turned his attention, when on the Board of Health, to necessary legislation concerning checking the disease. Statistics relative to smallpox are to be found in his article, \\"Medical and Vital Statistics,\\" published in The American Journal of the Medical Sciences for November, 1827, 1831, and July, 1848. Dr. Emerson made some contributions to the improvement of the agriculture of his native place, editing the Farmer's Encyclopedia and Dictionary of Rural Affairs. His interest in agriculture increased until he was entirely occupied with its demands to the exclusion of medicine. He definitely gave up his large practice in 1857 and occupied himself with questions of political economy and social science for the remaining years of his life.

Alan Bartholomai was born on 31 December 1938 in Boonah, Queensland. He attended Boonah State School and after his parents moved the family to the Gold Coast, he attended the Southport State School. He boarded at Gatton College in 1953-1954 where he took his Junior Certificate, and completed his senior studies at Southport State High School. He was able to obtain a Commonwealth Scholarship to attend the University of Queensland and pursue a BSc in geology and zoology, graduating in 1960. == Career == After graduation, Bartholomai was appointed the Curator of Geology at the Queensland Museum. He studied his MSc on fossil kangaroos, under the supervision of Dorothy Hill, and graduated in 1969. He continued his study toward a PhD, taking this in 1973 with a thesis on the Stratigraphy, skeletal morphology and evolution of the Upper Cainozoic and recent Macropodidae of Queensland. He became Director of the Queensland Museum in 1969 and continued in this role until 1999. Despite the difficulties of balancing this job with research, he maintained a steady interest in Cretaceous fish faunas of the Great Artesian Basin and published eleven papers on this topic. The Queensland Museum expanded under his direction; staff employed there increased from 44 to 200. He sought to employ professional staff with science and curatorial backgrounds and help the Museum build visitor numbers by revitalising displays. The Museum purchased life sized models of Triceratops horridus in 1976 and Tyrannosaurs rex in 1978, at his recommendation. The Museum was also moved to the South Bank Cultural Centre Precinct in 1985, as it had outgrown its previous location in Fortitude Valley near the Brisbane Exhibition show grounds. Further extensions to the Queensland Museum network occurred during Bartholomai’s time as Director, including the establishment of the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying at Woollongabba, Woodworks in Gympie, the Cobb & Co Museum in Toowoomba, the Museum of Tropical Queensland in Townsville, the Museum of North West Queensland in Mt Isa and the Science Centre in Brisbane. He was an Honorary Research Fellow with James Cook University. He served on a number of committees at both state and national level. He was a member of the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, the Lizard Island Research Committee (Australian Museum) and a past President of the Royal Society of Queensland. Bartholomai participated in the American Museum of Natural History expedition in 1971. He also undertook palaeontological work at Rewan in central Queensland. He joined the Natural History Museum (British) expedition to collect Queensland Mesozoic vertebrates in 1978. He had studied the Riversleigh site in Queensland in 1965, before it would become a major fossil site in 1975. He facilitated the acquisition of the Muttaburrasaurus and Minmi dinosaur specimens. Other collections which Bartholomai pursued for the Museum included a collection of personal memorabilia of Sir Charles Kingsford Smith.

A. Paul. The book analyzes decision-making in circumstances where one of the possible options offers a radically new experience that cannot be assessed in advance, such as deciding to become a parent, or choosing to alter one's physical or mental capabilities. Transformative Experience was covered in numerous popular and academic outlets, including The New York Times, The Times Literary Supplement, Commonweal, Mind, Dialogue, and the Australasian Journal of Philosophy. ==Summary== Rational choice models of decision-making suggest gathering information on options and then proceeding with the option that best fits a person's current preferences and values. Paul argues that such a decision- making process is not possible for some options, called \\"transformative experiences\\", because the experience fundamentally transforms the person experiencing it. Paul offers a hypothetical example of a decision to become a vampire. Because a person would be fundamentally transformed by becoming a vampire, they cannot possibly know in advance what being a vampire is like. Other vampires might offer information, but their advice is likely shaped by their own irreversible choice. In this situation, a fully informed comparison of preferences and values is impossible. Paul argues that several major life choices, such as having a child, converting to a religion, or medically altering one's physical and mental capacities, are transformative experiences that are structurally similar to becoming a vampire. A transformative experience changes the values and preferences held before making the decision. Making a choice therefore requires either relying on current preferences that may be incompatible with preferences developed after a transformative experience, or it requires relying on possibly biased or unreliable input from others about their transformative experiences. As neither of these options is consistent with a first-person preference-based rational decision-making model, making a rational decision about transformative experiences requires thinking about the decision-making process differently. Rather than focusing on a specific personal outcome, Paul suggests instead considering the value of \\"revelation\\" by weighing the value of becoming a different person against the value of remaining the same person. ==Background== An earlier version of the argument in Transformative Experience appeared in the working paper \\"What You Can't Expect When You're Expecting\\", which examined the failure of rational choice when deciding whether or not to have a child. The paper was later accepted at Res Philosophica, but the unpublished draft was widely discussed on philosophy blogs, including the group blog Crooked Timber. Writing in Psychology Today, Tania Lombrazo found the paper's argument against empirical decision-making unpersuasive, but acknowledged that people who become parents are more likely than childless people to value parenthood. ==Reception== Transformative Experience received attention from popular and academic media. Writing in The New York Times, columnist David Brooks praised Paul's \\"ingenious\\" description of the problem and repeated the book's opening example of becoming a vampire, but objected to Paul's focus on \\"revelation\\" as too focused on personal desires rather than moral improvement. Amia Srinivasan's review in The Times Literary Supplement proposed that the main issue raised in the book was \\"not about the rationality of decision-making, but about the ethics of making decisions rationally\\". In The Stone, Paul Bloom suggested that Paul's argument should be extended to include how people imagine others, not just their future selves. John Schwenkler, in a review for Commonweal, praised the book for its persuasive argument but also suggested that coming to trust another person's opinion about a transformative experience might itself be a form of transformative experience. By the end of 2015 Cass Sunstein had named Transformative Experience in his Bloomberg essay on the \\"best books of 2015 on human bias and blunders\\". Academic reviews offered several criticisms of the book but also acknowledged its influence on the field of philosophy. In a review in Mind, Richard Pettigrew criticized Paul's statement of the problem of deciding to become a parent, noting that the book did not consider how a person might rationally assign subjective probabilities that are not highly certain yet support a rational choice, but he concluded that the book \\"has proved enormously influential, and rightly so\\". Krister Bykvist's review in Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews suggested that Paul's analysis did not account for partial aspects of transformative experience that can be compared to known experiences. In Dialogue Irena Cronin praised the framework provided in Transformative Experience, particularly its distinction between decision- making processes in high-stakes life choices and low-stakes decisions about, for example, whether or not to try eating an unusual fruit. Writing for the Australasian Journal of Philosophy at the end of 2015, Marcus Arvan observed that Transformative Experience \\"has already received well-deserved public and philosophical attention\\", summarizing the book as \\"one of the best kinds of philosophy books\\". ==References== Category:2014 non-fiction books Category:Philosophy books ","title":"Transformative Experience"},{"id":"60288860","text":"__NOTOC__ John \\"Jackie\\" Maloney (1896–1971) was an American football and college basketball coach.

Another method of oxidizing hypobromous acid can be used: :HBrO + H2O - 2e− → HBrO2 \\\\+ 2H+ The oxidized bromine-containing acid need not contain oxygen originally, as in this comproportionation reaction: :2 HBrO3 \\\\+ HBr → 3 HBrO2 Bromous acid was originally prepared using another method of adding oxygen to hypobromous acid, where the free oxygen was freed from water when the free hydrogen was taken by NO3 (to form nitric acid) that was freed from silver nitrate when the silver was taken by elemental bromine to form silver bromide. :2 AgNO3 \\\\+ HBrO + Br2 \\\\+ H2O → HBrO2 \\\\+ 2 AgBr Chlorous acid may be generated from salts of the conjugate base, chlorite, which is more stable than chlorous acid. :Ba(ClO2)2 \\\\+ H2SO4 → BaSO4 \\\\+ 2 HClO2 ==Stability== Chlorous acid, bromous acid, and iodous acid are all unstable. Chlorous acid is the only isolatable halous acid, and while it has stable salts, they tend to decompose rapidly, some even explosively, upon heating. Neither bromous acid nor iodous acid has ever been isolated, and while a few salts of bromous acid have been isolated, the same is not true for iodous acid. One method of decomposition of halous acids is disproportionating to the corresponding hypohalous acid and halic acid: : 2 HClO2 → HClO + HClO3 : 2 HBrO2 → HBrO3 \\\\+ HOBr In acidic solutions, chlorous acid tends to decompose via another disproportionation reaction: : 5 HClO2 → 4 ClO2 \\\\+ HCl + 2 H2O ==References== Category:Halogen oxoacids ","title":"Halous acid"},{"id":"60289032","text":"Harvest Gold is an Indian food company, headquartered in New Delhi, that produces multiple varieties of bread and its associated products.

The film features an original score by Keri Latimer, dance performances by CindyMarie Small, Natasha Torres-Garner, and Ali Robson, and is choreographed by the dancers taking an award-winning original poem by Deborah Schnitzer as inspiration. ==Title== In its earliest release, the film bore the title of its source poem, Spellbinding, which won a Margaret Laurence Award. The film was re-released under its new title in 2013. Some early National Screen Institute sources mistakenly refer to the film as Is It My Turn? No question mark appears in the film's title onscreen. ==Synopsis== At first seen through a dome or globe, three women perform a piece of interpretive dance to music. ==Performers== *Natasha Torres-Garner *Ali Robson *CindyMarie Small ==Themes== Is It My Turn has been described as an \\"expression of the hope of the feminine, expressed through dance\\" and an exploration of the nature of \\"creative female energy\\" through dance. Shelagh Carter herself stated: \\"In capturing the moving images of three female dancers as an act of love, I return to that deep personal and professional space whose channels I have learned to open and touch as an artist. ==Production== ===Background and inspiration=== Is It My Turn is based on the poem Spellbinding by Deborah Schnitzer, who in turn was inspired by Gertrude Stein. Schnitzer has collaborated with Shelagh Carter several times on her films, starting with Rifting/Blue (2005). ===Financing=== Carter's film received support from the Winnipeg Film Group, Manitoba Film and Music, and a film/video tax credit from the Government of Canada. ===Filming=== The film was shot in the University of Winnipeg's Asper Centre for Theatre and Film, \\"with film students handling everything from shooting, camera angles, lighting, sound and post-production.\\" To make the film, the three dancers were given a poem by Deborah Schnitzer, Spellbinding, and asked to interpret assigned sections through dance, their movements filmed by cinematographer Danielle Sturk, who had also made a career as both a dance artist and choreographer. Carter found that the use of the 3D camera offered an opportunity to explore the visual depth of dance choreography as it could take far greater liberties with space and time, enhancing further the film’s ability to be interrupted at any moment. ===Editing and music=== After the shoot, the film was edited and scored, respectively, by Juno Award-winning musicians Chad Tremblay and Keri Latimer. ==Release== The film was initially released under the title Spellbinding, beginning its festival run in Los Angeles, at the Lady Filmmakers Film Festival in September 2012.

It stars Andy Samberg, Cristin Milioti, Peter Gallagher, and J. K. Simmons, and follows two strangers who meet at a Palm Springs wedding only to get stuck in a time loop. The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 26, 2020, and was released in select theaters by Neon and digitally on Hulu on July 10, 2020. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise drawn towards the performances of the cast and use of the concept. == Plot == On November 9, Nyles wakes up next to his girlfriend Misty on the wedding day of Tala and Abe. At the reception, he delivers a seemingly impromptu speech, to the relief of Tala's sister, the drunk and unprepared maid-of-honor Sarah. Nyles and Sarah bond and, after discovering Misty cheating on Nyles, are about to have sex when Nyles is abruptly shot in the shoulder with an arrow by an older man named Roy. Wounded, he crawls toward a mysterious amber light in a nearby cave, warning Sarah not to follow. Sarah, curious, is sucked into a vortex in the cave. Sarah wakes up, again, on November 9. After she confronts Nyles, he explains that she has become stuck in the same time loop as him. Sarah unsuccessfully attempts many escape methods, such as driving back to her hometown or suicide. Nyles and Sarah spend many days together, often relaxing in the pool of a home where the occupants are away on vacation. Nyles reveals that Roy is a family man who lives in Irvine, whom Nyles also trapped in the time loop. In a flashback, Nyles and Roy meet, party and do drugs, which they get from Trevor. Roy wishes that the night would never end and an inebriated Nyles introduces him the cave. Roy, unaware of the time loop, goes in. Nyles explains to Sarah that Roy blames him for getting stuck in the time loop and occasionally comes to Palm Springs to hunt Nyles for revenge. After many more loops, Nyles and Sarah camp out in the desert, where they see dinosaurs, and eventually have sex. The next day, Abe wakes Sarah up, advising her to leave his room (having spent the night of November 8 together). A guilt-ridden Sarah refuses to talk to Nyles about their previous night, expressing that everything they do is meaningless. They are pulled over by a police officer, who turns out to be Roy. Sarah runs over Roy in his police car, and after an argument, Nyles admits that he had sex with Sarah numerous times before she entered the time loop, something that he had lied about before. A disgusted Sarah runs in front of an oncoming truck, killing herself and restarting the day. After the next reset, Nyles goes looking for Sarah to apologize, but he cannot find her. Lying in Abe's bed while the groomsmen take drugs, Nyles smells Sarah's hair mist, Orchid Explosion by Fournier, on his pillows and realizes that Sarah and Abe had sex the night before the wedding. He confronts Abe during the wedding, and a fight breaks out between Nyles and Abe. Multiple resets later, Nyles realizes that he loves Sarah. He travels to Irvine to talk to Roy, who has given up on killing Nyles. Roy explains that his life is perfect but also imperfect, as he lives in the perfect day forever, but will never get to see the future or his children grow up. Roy says that they should never speak again, and Nyles asks Roy to murder him one last time by shooting him with an arrow. The time loops where Sarah was gone are then shown, Sarah confronts Abe over their affair, and both express their regret and remorse. Sarah then resolves to escape the time loop, spending many days in a diner studying quantum physics and talking with professors, finally coming to a solution. She tries her theory by sending a goat in the cave with explosives. The next reset, the goat disappeared. Sarah wakes Nyles up and tells him she believes she knows how to escape the time loop by blowing themselves up in the cave before they restart the day. Nyles admits he loves Sarah but wants to stay in the time loop forever, where he knows how everything will work precisely. She leaves him in the room alone, and a frustrated Nyles breaks up with Misty. Sarah attends the wedding, gives a heartfelt speech for Tala, makes a phone call, and goes to the cave with explosives. Drinking alone in a bar, Nyles decides to leave with her and rushes to the cave, professing he would rather die with her than remain in the loop alone. Sarah reciprocates his feelings, and they kiss while she presses the detonator. Nyles and Sarah again lounge in the vacant pool when the house owners show up, revealing it is November 10, and the plan worked. In a mid-credits scene, Roy approaches Nyles at the wedding, asking about Sarah's plan to escape the loop. When Nyles does not recognize Roy, Roy realizes the plan has worked and smiles. ==Cast== * Andy Samberg as Nyles, Misty's boyfriend and Sarah's love interest * Cristin Milioti as Sarah Wilder, Tala's sister, Howard's daughter and Nyles' love interest * J.

Johnson as himself ==Production== Andy Siara wrote the first draft of the script during his second year as a film student at AFI, and did not include elements of science fiction. He said the script originally had more in common with Leaving Las Vegas than Groundhog Day, and the script was deliberately limited so that it would be something they might actually be able to make. Siara went on to write for the television show Lodge 49 and redeveloped the script into a more ambitious project. While Groundhog Day was a fundamentally important starting point for the use of a time loop in a romantic comedy, Barbakow and Siara knew they needed to distance their script from the film. This led to starting with Nyles already within the time loop, making the film like \\"a sequel to a movie that doesn't exist\\" according to Siara, and then adding Sarah as a second character within the loop to serve as a point of navigation for the audience. The project was announced in November 2018 after it secured a tax credit to film in California, however due to the limitations of that tax credit, they were forced to film in Los Angeles area rather than Palm Springs. Andy Samberg was revealed as starring in the film. In March 2019, Cristin Milioti and J. K. Simmons joined the cast. Camila Mendes was added in April.'Riverdale's Camila Mendes To Star In Netflix Film 'Windfall'; Joins J.K. Simmons & Andy Samberg in 'Palm Springs' Filming began in April 2019.

She has studied father-child relationships and takes the position that human fatherhood would not have developed unless the investment that fathers make in their children is vital for the survival of the species. She has concluded that fatherhood was fundamental to the development of humans and humanity, with fathers performing critical parenting tasks in coaching and educating their children. Machin has also studied the expectations and reality of fatherhood, and systemic impediments to fathers' involvement in their children's lives. ==Popular media== Machin has been interviewed and cited about fatherhood and love relationships by a variety of popular media outlets, including the New Scientist,Jessica Hamzelou, Dad power: The surprising new science of fatherhood, New Scientist, March 21, 2018.

Her career represents one of the few artistic occupations felt to be suitable for young women during the nineteenth century. Butler was the daughter of tinsmith Aaron Butler of Greenville, New York and his wife Sarah Cornell; she was the eldest of eleven, of whom nine survived to attend Greenville Academy. Ann may have learned to paint at this institution. From an early age she was familiar with most aspects of her father's business; she even accompanied him on business trips, traveling as far away as New York City. Family lore indicates that she was in charge of decorating tinware by the age of fourteen or fifteen. She went on to teach her sisters Minerva, Marilla, and Harriet to paint on tin as well, and their work is greatly similar to hers. Butler's work ceased upon her marriage, arranged by her father, to Eli Scutt, with whom she moved to Livingstonville, where she raised three children, and where she is buried. Her father's shop at Brandy Hill in Greenville, which had been active since around 1824, ceased production in around 1855. Butler signed a number of her pieces with her full name; other works are marked with a heard-shaped device in which her initials are included. Thanks to this, it has been possible to identify certain stylistic characteristics of her work. Flowers are often painted in red, sometimes with blue; white paint is used to provide delineation. Fine ink work can be found in various places, and is sometimes used to build crosshatching. Decoration is dense, with various elements painted brightly against a dark background. One writer has describe her style as \\"busy\\". Numerous pieces by Butler survive in the collection of the American Folk Art Museum. ==References== Category:1813 births Category:1887 deaths Category:American women painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:19th-century American women artists Category:People from Greenville (town), New York Category:Painters from New York (state) ","title":"Ann Butler (painter)"},{"id":"60289322","text":"Beijing NO. 20 High School (Chinese: 北京市第二十中学 or 北京二十中学 or simply 二十中), is a public combined secondary school, providing both junior and senior stage secondary education.

The 1948 discovery of the takahe, the largest living member of the rail family, happened after unrecognized bird footprints were found, and Geoffrey Orbell, an Invercargill-based physician, led an expedition to find the unknown bird. After this, an area of was set aside for the conservation of the takahē. To this day it is the only place where wild takahē can be seen. It is the longest running conservation programme in New Zealand. With the aim of protecting the native bird populations, the New Zealand Department of Conservation started a program in 2002 to control stoats in the area. In 2007, a population increase of stoats in the mountains after a beech and tussock mast seeding led to a halving of the takahē population. The numbers of red deer in the Murchison Mountains steadily grew between 1930 and 1973 but hunting on foot and helicopter reduced the population by 60% between 1973 and 1975. In a 1953 expedition to the Murchison Mountains for the Canterbury Museum, W. R. Philipson discovered a new type of plant from the genus Pachycladon, Pachycladon crenata.

He was a son-in-law of Francisco Ribalta, whose painting style was similar; as was that of his brother-in-law, Juan Ribalta, leading to a misattribution of many of his paintings. He was virtually forgotten until these errors were corrected. == Biography == His father, Salvador, was a painter from Aragón who came to Valencia just before Vicente's birth. His mother, Jerónima Comes, was the daughter of Jerónimo Comes, also a painter. It is likely that his father worked, at least temporarily, for Francisco Ribalta. In 1616, he was inscribed on the list of the College of Painters. After 1620, he worked in Segorbe, together with Juan Ribalta and Abdón Castañeda. The three also created an altarpiece in Andilla, completed in 1626, and painted two images (now lost) for the chapel of the Communion at the Segorbe Cathedral. The Apotheosis of San Bruno at the (now at the ), was originally attributed to Francisco Ribalta; although it now appears to have been done by Castelló.Benito Domenech (1987) He is also credited with completing the Virgin of Porta-Coeli at the Porta Coeli Charterhouse (now at the Museo de Bellas Artes de Valencia), which was begun by the elder Ribalta in 1625. Both of the Ribaltas died in 1628, and Castelló took over the family workshop. In 1630, he was back in Segorbe, where he engaged in a challenge, from Pedro García Ferrer, to create a painting on the theme Story of the Innocents, entirely of their own invention; nothing copied from other sources. The loser would forfeit fifty Libras (Pounds).Kowal, David The last reference to Castelló is in 1635, from the papers of the Bishop of Segorbe, , regarding a commission for a painting of The Last Supper.

His main research interests include neural stem cell and brain development. He is a member of the National Academy of Medicine. == Early life and education == Kriegstein received his BA in biology and psychology from Yale University in 1971, and his MD and Ph.D. degrees from New York University in 1977. He completed his doctoral work in physiology in the laboratory of Eric Kandel and residency training in neurology at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Children's Hospital, and Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He is a board-certified neurologist. == Career == Following residency, Kriegstein began his academic career at Stanford University where he worked for ten years, serving as a pediatric and adult neurologist as well as starting his research laboratory. He held appointments at Yale University from 1991-1993 before joining the Neurology Department at Columbia University in 1993 where he stayed until 2004. While at Columbia, Kriegstein was named the John and Elizabeth Harris Professor of Neurology and became the founding director of the Neural Stem Cell Program at Columbia University. Kriegstein joined the University of California, San Francisco in 2004, where he became the John Bowes Distinguished Professor in Stem Cell and Tissue Biology and founding director of the UCSF Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research. In 2011, the $123 million Ray & Dagmar Dolby Regeneration Medicine Building was opened, which is home to the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine at University of California, San Francisco. The building houses one of the largest stem cell programs in the United States with over 70 laboratories. == Research == Kriegstein is known for research focusing on the way in which neural stem cells and progenitor cells produce neurons in the embryonic brain, and how this information can be used for cell- based therapies to treat diseases of the nervous system. His lab found that radial glial cells, long thought to simply guide nerve cells during migration, are neuronal stem cells in the developing brain. This concept, unexpected at the time, is now one of the tenets of developmental neuroscience. Kriegstein also described a class of intermediate precursor cells produced by radial glia, suggesting a new mechanism for the generation of cell diversity. More recent research has focused on the developing human brain. Kriegstein discovered that the outer subventricular zone, a progenitor region in the developing human brain, contains a novel neural stem cell type he termed the outer radial glial (oRG). He found that oRG cells generate transit amplifying daughter cells, thus producing further complex neuronal lineages. Over the past several years, Kriegstein has applied strategies for massively parallel profiling molecular and physiological properties of primary human cortical cells using microfluidic technologies, cellular barcoding, and timelapse microscopy to identify additional progenitor cell types. His research has also addressed brain evolution and neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. == Honors == Solomon A.

It was the spiritual successor to the 2009 film of the same name, also directed by Imtiaz Ali. ==Plot== Zoe and Veer meet at a bar. The two leave and decide to spend the night together at Veer's home but Veer stops Zoe from continuing their act. He tells her that the time is not right. Zoe leaves, infuriated. Veer keeps following Zoe, who finally confronts him and asks him not to follow her. There is a flashback scene where Leena and Raghuvendra \\"Raghu\\" Singh have the same conversation back in the 1990's in Udaipur. Back to present day, Veer drops her for an interview at the office of the Mehta Group and they slowly begin their relationship. Raghu is an ex- medical student who ran away from Udaipur and now owns several restaurants in Delhi, including the café at which Zoe hangs out very often. Raj, who is good friends with Zoe, tells her the story of his childhood sweetheart, Leena, thus implying that he is a grown up Raghu. He tells her that he used to behave with Leena just as Veer behaves with Zoe, and recites his own childhood memories with Leena to Zoe and tells her how he asked Leena for a dance together. In the flashback, it is seen that Raghu and Leena used to meet each other secretly and how Raghu left everything for Leena and moved for her to Delhi, discontinuing his studies to be with Leena. Later one day Zoe walks in on Raj and a woman, assuming she is Leena, but realizes it's not the case. Raj now reveals that he left Leena, for his own big town fantasies. Zoe is convinced by her mother that she can't possibly have both her love and career together. She goes to meet Veer's parents, but leaves crying. Veer relays to Raj what Zoe did, and Raj, convinced that he influenced Zoe towards behaving this way, responds by getting her the job. Some days later, Zoe sees Veer with another girl. Heartbroken, she hangs out with multiple people but doesn't happen to like any of them. She goes to a bar with a guy and gets drunk but he refuses to drop her at her home. Veer picks her and drops at her house. He tells that he can't enter a relationship of compromises with Zoe and breaks up with her. The next day he informs her about a new job in the Himalayas and is leaving for 2 years, explaining that he has as much right to be focused on his career as does she, and bids her goodbye. Zoe gets a proposal from the Mehta family to marry Rishabh, but she refuses. When Zoe goes to meet Raj, he tells her that he met Leena one last time, when he realized he lost the person who he was before with Leena and finds that she is pregnant. He leaves from there, gets into a cab and goes to airport. He adds that he still misses Leena, but is helpless now. He starts crying and Zoe comforts him. Raj tells her that she shouldn't make the same mistake he made. Zoe leaves for the Himalayas to reunite with Veer. She sees Veer sleeping outside. She goes and rests atop him. She says that she won't be able to balance between love & work ever, but still she wanted to be with him. Veer asks whether she will take a leap with him, to which she agrees, and they reunite and kiss. == Cast == * Kartik Aaryan as Veer Taneja / Raghvendra \\"Raghu\\" Singh * Sara Ali Khan as Zoe Chauhan * Randeep Hooda as Raj, in reality an adult Raghvendra \\"Raghu\\" Singh * Simone Singh as Zoe's Mother * Arushi Sharma as Leena Gupta * Siddharth Kak as Mr. Harshwardhan Mehta * Pranati Rai Prakash as Office Girl * Kavita Ghai as Veer's Mother * Shataf Figar as Veer's Father * Vedika Haralalka as Zoe's Friend * Monika Panwar as Sweetu * Siddharth Shaw as Rathore ==Production== On 17 January 2019, it was reported that Ali was considering his next venture with Khan and Aaryan, a romantic film.
