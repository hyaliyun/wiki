It was built in response to a United States Navy requirement for an anti-ship rocket capable of hitting ships outside of their anti-aircraft range, with a payload capable of sinking heavy shipping. The Tiny Tim was manufactured using 11.75-inch (298 mm) pipe, which was chosen because it was already being manufactured. Used oil field 11.75-inch pipe was acquired for the prototypes. Also, the 11.75-inch size was of interest in the development because there was already available a 500-pound semiarmor-piercing bomb that was adaptable for use as the warhead for the rocket. One of the rocket project scientists commented on the shortage of the piping ‚Äú. . . we were reduced for a time to the expedient of salvaging [oil-well casing] from abandoned oil wells.‚Äù Jack Latimer The Tiny Tim's diameter of 11.75 in (29.8 cm) was the first Allied aerial rocket to have a larger calibre than the Luftwaffe-deployed bomber destroyer aerial rocket ordnance, the Nebelwerfer-based BR 21 of 21 cm (8-1/4 in) calibre. The Tiny Tim's large diameter allowed a sizable 148.5 lb (67.4 kg) semi-armor-piercing high-explosive warhead, some 60 lbs (27 kg) heavier than the BR 21's 40.8 kg (90 lb) warhead. The Tiny Tim had a maximum range of 1,500 meters (1,640 yards), some 200 meters greater than the BR 21's time-fuze limited 1.2 km detonation range from launch. They were used by the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps near the end of the war during the battle of Okinawa, and during the Korean War. A problem with the sheer power of the rocket motor causing damage to the firing aircraft was resolved by having the Tiny Tim drop like a bomb, and a lanyard attached to the rocket would snap, causing the rocket to ignite.Slover, G: \\"Chapter-11-C, 11C3. Suspension and launching of aircraft rockets\\", \\"Gene Slover\\". Common targets included coastal defense guns, bridges, pillboxes, tanks, and shipping. An ambitious operation to use the Tiny Tim against German V-1 sites as part of Operation Crossbow, code-named Project Danny, was planned but cancelled before the squadrons assigned could be deployed to Europe. Common Tiny Tim delivery aircraft during World War II included the PBJ-1 Mitchell, F4U Corsair, F6F Hellcat, TBM Avenger, and the SB2C Helldiver. After World War II, the United States Navy's rocket laboratory at Inyokern, California developed an even larger version of the Tiny Tim, called \\"Richard\\", which was 14 inches in diameter and one of the largest air-to-surface unguided rocket ever developed for the US military. While tested, it was never placed in production. The United States Navy also experimented with a version of the Tiny Tim which was a two-stage rocket, with another Tiny Tim rocket motor mounted behind a complete Tiny Tim. Like the Richard, it never moved beyond the research and development stage.\\"Smash Hits\\" Popular Mechanics, March 1947. ==Gallery== File:Navy rockets enlarged.pngU.S. Navy rockets on display at Michelson Laboratory, NOTS China Lake File:ALEXIS DEMBER 1953.jpgAlexis B.

He earned his B.A. at Haverford College in 1955 and his M.A. at Columbia University in 1956. In college, Marek was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. Marek married Margot Lynn Ravage in 1954. The couple had two children before Marek's wife passed on in 1987. Marek served in the U.S. Army from 1956 to 1957. During that time he was stationed in Japan. ==Career== Marek's career in the publishing business began with his positions as an editor at McCall's magazine and his work at Macmillan publishing starting in 1962. In 1968, he signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968 New York Post Over the course of his career, Marek was also employed at companies like World Publishing, and Dial Press. Marek ran his own publishing imprint, Richard Marek Books, at Putnam Publishing Group from 1977 to 1981. In 1985, Marek began serving as the president of E. P. Dutton. As Marek remarked in an online profile, he has been responsible for editing \\"well over 300 books\\". Marek's first major piece of writing, Works of Genius (1987), was a novel that dealt with the inner workings of the publishing industry. The novel received praise from several major publications such as The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times Book Review. Marek's second writing, Here is my Hope: A Book of Healing and Prayer: Inspirational Stories of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, was co-written with Randi Henderson and was published in 2001.

Working primarily in painting, installation, and sculpture, he does not have a single style or medium. He considers his work to be intensely personal and biographical. Pruitt has exhibited extensively in New York and internationally; in 2013 the Aspen Art Museum held his mid-career retrospective. ==Early life and education== Born in Washington, DC, Pruitt grew up in Rockville, Maryland. He attended Corcoran College of Art and Design, where he became friendly with the admissions director, Tim Gunn. Pruitt transferred to Parsons School of Design when Gunn began teaching there. During college, Pruitt lived at the Chelsea Hotel and says he focused his energy on partying rather than studying. ==ArtworkEarly work=== Pruitt began exhibiting in the early 1990s with his then collaborator, Jack Early. After a controversial exhibition at Leo Castelli Gallery their partnership disintegrated and neither had major shows for several years. While galleries refused to represent his solo work, Pruitt contributed to a few group shows. Pieces from this time dealt with his exclusion from the art world; his first sculpture at Gavin Brown's enterprise was an Evian fountain, which, as Mia Fineman points out, is related to baptism and rebirth. In 1998 Pruitt caused another minor scandal with a piece called Cocaine Buffet which was shown at The Fifth International, Chivas Clem's artists run space. The show was co- curated by Jennifer Bornstein. He installed a 16-foot mirror with a line of real cocaine running down the center, in which visitors were welcome to partake. Publicity stunt, peace offering, minimalist sculpture, or indictment of the greed and glamour of the art world, it changed the sensation associated with his name. ===101 Art Ideas You Can Do Yourself=== The following year Pruitt held his first solo show, ‚Äú101 Art Ideas You Can Do Yourself,‚Äù where he applied humor to the genre of language-based conceptual art. The recipe-style book was filled with instructions for making and decorating such as ‚ÄúPaint secret paintings on walls with glow in the dark paint‚Äù and ‚ÄúDraw yourself into your favorite comic strip.‚Äù Others were suggestions on how to interact with the world in a different way, like ‚ÄúSit on the toilet backwards‚Äù and ‚ÄúGo on an animal photo safari in a city: dogs, cats, pigeons, rats, and squirrels.‚Äù The exhibition was thirty-five of these instructions realized, including an exercise bike facing a painting and a pile of pennies on the floor. During the time he was barred from the art world, Pruitt briefly worked for Martha Stewart Living, coming up with DIY craft ideas; a DIY sensibility runs throughout his work. ===Pandas=== In 2001 Pruitt showed the first of the glittery panda paintings that would become his trademark. He explains his choice of subject matter thus: ‚ÄúI see it as a kind of corporate damage control -- like trying to market Perrier after they found benzene in it, or Firestone tires after they exploded. I was a reviled figure, but everybody loves a panda.‚Äù He remembers childhood visits to the giant pandas at the National Zoo. Pruitt has made many versions his panda painting using different techniques and stylizations of the same subject matter. Critic Michelle Grabner analyzes the panda project thus: ‚ÄúThe paintings' clich√©d imagery neutralizes their real endangered status making us less culpable in the creatures' pending extinction. And therein lies the beauty of the clich√©d image.\\" She goes on, \\"This appropriation of similes, once strictly the providence of kitsch, has nothing to do with blurring the distinctions between high and low. Instead, rainbows and butterflies have come to symbolize a magical new world where order is without hierarchies, edification is without snobbishness[‚Ä¶]Pruitt produces his art without the slightest glance of irony. He makes glamorous and admirable our drive for worldly success while commiserating with our search for inner virtue.‚Äù Although the paintings are designed and tightly crafted, they are imperfect; the artist's hand is evident. His use of glitter has been compared to Andy Warhol's diamond dust, but Pruitt describes his own work as ‚Äúbasically blown up versions of dining table craft projects... I‚Äôve really enjoyed letting the world know that not everything is so mystified or so regulated to expertise‚Äîthat you can make something really beautiful with a little ingenuity and some supplies from Michael‚Äôs.‚Äù Pruitt collaborated with Jimmy Choo in 2012 to create a line of shoes and handbags featuring panda bears and animal prints. In 2013 Pruitt installed his \\"Last Panda\\" show at Gavin Brown's defunct bar, the Passerby. The space, which was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy, provided an apocalyptic setting for his rainbow-colored work. ===Flea Market=== Pruitt began his Flea Market happening for the 1999 Gavin Brown summer show. He invited artist friends to set up tables and sell whatever they wanted, be it their own artwork or junk from their apartment. The gallery space became a place to socialize with the artist, creating a feeling of community between makers and sellers. The Flea Market has since been repeated at art fairs and museums. For the market's latest iteration, Pruitt is running an eBay store, which features a curated selection from his collection of secondhand objects. Describing shopping as a familiar, comforting activity, he regularly attends estate sales. ===Art Awards=== The Guggenheim approached him in 2009 to reimagine their annual fund-raising event. Instead of the usual gala, Pruitt conceived a performance piece: a tongue-in-cheek, Oscars-style award show, with nominees for categories like Solo Gallery Show of the Year, Critic of the Year, and Best New Artist. Like much of Pruitt's work, the show falls somewhere between sincerity and parody. Although it is not unheard of to give awards for fine art (in Britain, for example, the Tate awards the prestigious Turner Prize), Pruitt's Art Awards are not universally popular with critics. Artist of the Year Mary Heilmann describes them as ‚Äúserious and deep and cheesy at the same time.‚Äù The 2013 rendition of the art awards appeared in Art in America and featured selfies of the nominees. ===Pattern and Degradation=== 2010 saw Pruitt's sprawling solo show ‚ÄúPattern and Degradation,‚Äù which was considered confirmation of his part of the art establishment. The show was held at Gavin Brown and spilled over to the nearby gallery Maccarone Inc. It featured brightly patterned paintings influenced by Amish quilt designs. Pruitt was inspired by the idea of rumspringa, a time when Amish youths leave their community to experience the broader world before returning to the church and responsibility. He describes an artist's life as a kind of perpetual rumspringa, less constrained as artists are from the traditional expectations of society. The show also included humanoid monsters made out of trash, collaged self-portraits, candy- filled stacks of painted tires, and photorealistic paintings of Cinnabon cinnamon rolls with geometrically piped paint for icing. Randy Kennedy describes a unifying theme to the multivalent show: ‚ÄúEverything in it seems to pivot on the idea of pattern and design as a valiant but usually doomed attempt to impose some order and beauty on a random, chaotic world.‚Äù ===Gradient paintings=== Pruitt has made a variety of paintings with colored gradients. The ‚ÄúFaces‚Äù series are scrawled line drawings of features that are then transferred onto gradients and flocked. Reminiscent of emoji, each face has a distinct emotion or personality. These developed into a later series called ‚ÄúThe Suicide Paintings,‚Äù window-like portals consisting of pure gradients juxtaposed by a differently colored frame. While the gradients are close to perfect, they are not digitally generated. These paintings were installed with chromed television sets and stacks of black and white cubes. They look like color studies, polluted vistas, and screen savers. Critic Florence Waters describes her experience with the work: \\"The absence of a story is made alarming by the scale and intensity of the encounter with colour on canvas.\\" The Andy Monument (2011) ===Other projects=== Pruitt and Jonathan Horowitz collaborated on an installation piece called Peacock Hill. In 2003 they bought a ramshackle, eleven-bedroom Victorian mansion in Fleischmanns, New York, painted it black, and decorated it like a haunted house with faux taxidermy and gothic furniture. Outside they arranged a graveyard using plywood tombstones with sardonic inscriptions. Ken Johnson compared it to the self-mocking art-as-life collaborations of Gilbert and George but overall described the project, as it was presented in a 2003 exhibit at Gavin Brown's Enterprise, as \\"self-congratulatory.\\" Pruitt used tombstones again in a 2008 show where he created monuments for celebrities who had died the previous year. They were installed in a room whose walls were papered in a year's worth of iPhone photographs. In 2011 Pruitt created \\"The Andy Monument\\" for the Public Art Fund; it is a ten-foot-tall, chrome-finished statue of Andy Warhol. The sculpture resided outside the building that housed Warhol's Factory in the 1970s and early 1980s. In 2016, Pruitt collaborated with the retailer J. Crew to design a limited edition piece of clothing: a rash guard inspired by his color gradient work. The Rob Pruitt‚Ñ¢ for J. Crew Rash Guard retails for $125.00, with half of the proceeds donated to charity. A recent demonstration of his work was showcased as part of the Desert X exhibit in the Coachella Valley from February 25 - April 30, 2017. ==Art market== Represented by Gavin Brown's Enterprise and Massimo De Carlo, Pruitt shows regularly at art fairs. He is also known for throwing parties; on April 20, 2013 he turned MOCA's annual gala into a weed-themed bacchanalia, which raised over two million dollars. In June 2013 his work set a record price at a Christie's charity auction when a panda painting sold for $315,000, over twice its estimated value. == Personal life == Pruitt currently resides in New York City with his partner Jonathan Horowitz, who is also an artist. ==Published works== * * * ==External links== *Official website *The Rob Pruitt Flea Market on eBay *The Rob Pruitt Book Club on eBay *Gavin Brown's Enterprise *Massimo de Carlo ==References== Category:American contemporary artists Category:1964 births Category:Artists from Washington, D.C.

As per Plaster's biography from its official press kit, the band's sound is inspired by the music of Amon Tobin, The Herbaliser, Jazzanova, The Cinematic Orchestra, and Medeski Martin & Wood. Plaster's debut album First Aid Kit was released on Nov 10, 2005.

Goncalves was invited to audition for her and to demonstrate his programming expertise. He returned the next day for another session when a producer in attendance mentioned that Goncalves also played drums.

Signed amateur for Middlesbrough FC aged 15, Professional at 17 and made his debut for Middlesbrough at Highbury against Arsenal at 19. As the last line of defence, during the 1934‚Äì35 season, he scored 5 own goals against Middlesbrough playing in Left Back position. Towards the end of the 1938 season Middlesbrough played Stoke who then had the legendary Stanley Matthews on the right wing. The match report stated 'Stuart staying close to Matthews prevented the maestro performing his usual magic.' When questioned how he managed to achieve the feat he stated \\"I respected Stanley's skill so I just kept my eye on the ball and shuffled him into the corner\\", this allowing the defence to be ready to manage any eventual cross.' He continued in the Left back position until the outbreak of World War II when he joined the RAF as L.A.C.

It outlawed many forms of practices including 'buggery' or male-to-male penetrative sex. The punishment was life imprisonment or a jail sentence of not less than 10 years. It abolished the death penalty for such acts, which had been law up to this point.Lacey, Brian (2008) Terrible Queer Creatures: Homosexuality in Irish History. Dublin ==Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885== Commonly known as the Labouchere Amendment. This act outlawed what was termed ‚Äòacts of gross indecency‚Äô between men both in public and in private. The definition was vague and included intimate acts falling short of penetrative sex between two men. Male to male sex was illegal under previous law but it was very narrowly interpreted by the courts. Usually, the courts required that penetration to have occurred for 'buggery' to have taken place. This new act made it much easier to punish the intimate acts of men together. The penalty was a maximum of two years imprisonment. The most famous person to be convicted under this act was Oscar Wilde. ==Vagrancy Act 1898== This prohibited soliciting or importuning for immoral purposes. It was originally intended as a measure against male to female prostitution, however, in practice, these measures were almost solely applied to male-to-male sex acts. ==Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 1912== This allowed flogging to be used as a punishment for existing crimes in regards to sexual offences. ==Criminal Law Bill 1921== Proposed to extend the provision criminalising gross indecency between males to gross indecency between females. This bill was dropped due to those who felt that to even criminalise female-to-female sex acts would draw attention to these acts and publicise them.

He argued that the law infringed on his right to privacy to have consensual sex with a man and that since the introduction of the Constitution of Ireland the law passed under British rule became repugnant to the constitution. The High Court ruled against Norris. He appealed his case to the Supreme Court. ==Norris v. the Attorney General (1983) (Supreme Court)== Having lost his High Court case Norris appealed his case to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law by a three to two verdict. ==Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act 1985== This act legalised the manufacture, sale, and importation of condoms in Ireland. Prior to this condoms were banned under the law. The law was changed to allow condoms in order to help protect the health and lives of gay men during the AIDS crisis. ==Norris v. Ireland (1988) (European Court of Human Rights)== Having lost the Supreme Court case Norris took his case to the European Court of Human Rights. The European Court struck down the law criminalising male-to-male sex on the grounds of privacy. It was held that this infringed on the right of adults to engage in acts of their own choice. Irish law was regarded as too narrow and extreme.NORRIS v. IRELAND - 10581/83 (European Court of Human Rights) ==Regulations regarding sexual orientation in the Irish Civil Service (1988)== These regulations affected the terms and conditions of employment of civil servants. These regulations prohibited discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or if a person was HIV positive.Circular 12/88: Civil Service policy on AIDS (PC 160) ==Prohibition of Incitement To Hatred Act 1989== Prohibited inciting hatred on various grounds including a person's sexual orientation. This was the first piece of legislation to actually provide some protection gays and lesbians. ==Video Recordings Act 1989== This act regulates the sale and supply of video recordings. It allows the Censor to suppress videos that are likely to stir up hatred against a person or group of persons on account of their sexual orientation as well as on other grounds. ==Child Care Act 1991== This act regulates the service of fostering. This act permits same-sex couples to apply jointly for fostering. This may not have been intended at the time to permit same-sex couples to foster children, however, it has since become practice to allow same-sex couple to foster.Dr. John Mee and Kaye Ronayne (2000) Partnership Rights of Same-Sex Couples (Equality Authority) Dublinhttp://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/cohabiting_couples/fostering_and_unmarried_couples.html 50px This content is available under the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0. ==Adoption Act 1991== Up until this act, an adoption could only be granted to a married couple living together, the natural parents of the child, a relative of the child or a widow or widower. This act allowed a person not related to the child to adopt provided the Adoption Board was satisfied that this was in the best interests of the child. This meant that a single person irrespective of their sexual orientation could adopt a child. Presumably, this was to take place in exceptional circumstances. Same-sex and opposite-sex cohabiting couples were not permitted to apply for adoption. This has since been changed by the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. ==Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993== Decriminalised acts of male-to-male sex. This act repealed the sections of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 on buggery over the age of 17 thereby setting an equal age of consent for same-sex or opposite-sex sexual intercourse. It also repealed as a whole the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, thereby abolishing 'acts of gross indecency between males' in law. ==Unfair Dismissals (Amendment) Act 1993== Prohibited dismissing an employee on a number of grounds including sexual orientation. ==Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993== This act provided the legal basis for social welfare payments and consolidated all previous acts regarding social welfare into one act. This act allowed for some social welfare payments to be given to cohabiting opposite-sex couples. Same-sex couples were not recognised and thus were unable to apply for any social welfare payments as a couple. ==Health Insurance Act 1994== This act prohibited health insurance companies from varying their premiums on the grounds of a person's sexual orientation. ==Domestic Violence Act 1996== Allows for a partner in a same-sex cohabiting relationship to apply for safety order or an interim protection order but does not allow for a permanent barring order which was at the time available to married couples and opposite-sex couples. This has since been changed. See Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 below. Also see Domestic Violence Bill 2017 Mee and Ronayne (2000) Partnership Rights ==Powers of Attorney Act 1996== Widened a person's right to grant power of attorney beyond their family or next of kin. A person could grant power of attorney to another person i.e. their partner where that person becomes unable to make decisions for themselves due to mental incapacity. This law has since been amended by the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015. ==Refugee Act 1996== Allows refugee status to be conferred on an individual on the basis of a fear of persecution arising from their sexual orientation. ==Freedom of Information Act 1997== This act allows the general public to have access to information and records kept about them by the civil service, state agencies and by private companies. The act allows information on a person's sexual orientation to be kept on record and to be shared. ==Treaty of Amsterdam 1997== Sexual orientation was included amongst the grounds for prohibiting discrimination at work. See Treaty of Amsterdam. In order to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam, a referendum had to be held to amend the Irish constitution. The 18th Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1998 amended the constitution in order to allow the state to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam. ==British-Irish Agreement 1998== The British-Irish Agreement provided the legal basis for the Good Friday Agreement. In the Good Friday Agreement, the British government gave a commitment to establish a Human Rights Commission for Northern Ireland. It also committed all public bodies to carry out their duties with due regard for the need to promote equality of opportunity on nine grounds including sexual orientation. The Irish government gave a similar commitment. The 19th Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1998 allowed the Irish state to ratify the British-Irish Agreement. ==Employment Equality Act 1998== Prohibited discrimination at work on a number of grounds including sexual orientation. The act covered aspects such as terms and conditions in employment contracts; promotion and demotion; harassment at work; indirect discrimination; pay and work conditions; membership of unions and professional bodies; and participating in training courses. Mechanisms were put in place to ensure the enforcement of this Act. A person can seek mediation or adjudication with the Equality Authority or go to the Equality Tribunal for a binding ruling which can only be appealed to the courts on a point of law. Under Section 37 (1) of the original 1998 act, a religious institution that provides religious, educational or medical services enjoyed a broad exemption from this act. The unamended Section 37(1) allowed religious-run schools and hospitals to take action against an employee or prospective employee in order to uphold their ethos. Since 98% of primary schools and 52% of secondary schools are religious run, this meant that up until 2015 a school could legally discriminate against a gay or lesbian employee. Section 37.1 was amended to narrow the grounds for legal discrimination. See Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015. ==Equal Status Act 2000== Prohibited discrimination on many grounds, including sexual orientation, in the provision of services and goods by commercial companies as well as by state institutions such as the civil service and state agencies. It covered a wide area of services such as financial produces‚Äìmortgages, savings, loans; access to building and clubs and societies‚Äìnot be allowed to be told to leave on the grounds on ones sexual orientation from a nightclub etc.; the state through it civil service and its various agencies could not discriminate in matter such as‚Äìgranting loans or grants to university, providing an individual dole to other social assistant; in terms of renting property a landlord could not refuse to offer accommodation to a gay man or couple or evict them on that basis. The Act also empowered the Equality Authority to monitor and enforce the law regarding equality in both the provision of goods and services and employment. A person can take a case to the Equality Tribunal in the event of discrimination occurring. ==Finance Act 2000== Allowed cohabiting couples either same-sex or opposite-sex to apply for relief on Capital Acquisitions Tax on their property in limited circumstances. ==Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001== This restated the prohibition of discrimination in the provision of health insurance on the grounds of sexual orientation under the Health Insurance Act, 1994. This applies to individuals and not same-sex couples. ==Implementing Equality for Lesbians, Gays, and Bisexuals 2002== In a wide-ranging report on the situation of gays and lesbian in Ireland, the Equality Authority made many recommendations for change across many areas. Most of its recommendations were non-statutory. It called for all policies of the government departments to be equality proofed on the grounds of sexual orientation. It called for many changes needed to help benefit gays and lesbians for example hospital visits of partners of same-sex couples, provision of services where the provider are ignorant or unaware of the needs of gays and lesbians. It also called on for civil marriage to be widened to also for same-sex couples to marry. It also called on for civil partnership laws to be introduced if same-sex marriage is not allowed.Equality Authority (2002) Implementing Equality for Lesbians, Gays, and Bisexuals ==European Arrest Warrants Act 2003== This act gave legal effect to the EU Framework Decision on the issuing of European Arrest Warrants. A European arrest warrant applies to all of the EU. However, the Minister for Justice can refuse to surrender a person if it is believed that the European arrest warrant was issued in order to punish that person on the grounds of their sexual orientation as well as on other discriminatory grounds. ==Civil Registration Act 2004== Placed a bar on the ability of two men or two women from entering into marriage. This reinforced the common law understanding, at the time, that marriage is between one man and one woman. This act allowed for marriages (between a man and a woman) to take place in other locations than a church and a registry office. This bar has since been removed by the Marriage Act 2015. ==Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004== This act prohibited unfair discrimination in the provision of occupational pensions on the grounds of sexual orientation. This related to individuals only. This does not make a requirement for pension schemes to pay a death grant to the surviving partner of a same-sex relationship. This has been partially amended with the enactment of civil partnership and the enactment of marriage for same-sex couples. Married same-sex couples and civil partners are in general entitled by law to a death grant from an occupational pension scheme where that scheme does the same for married opposite-sex couples. A same-sex cohabiting couple do not enjoy this protection. ==Equality Act 2004== Allows for positive action to be taken in the workforce in order to promote greater equality on all nine grounds as outlined in the act including sexual orientation. It also closes a loophole in regards to harassment whereby a person does not have to have the characteristics imputed to them in a situation of harassment. For example, if a person is subject to homophobic jokes but that person is not gay or lesbian they may take legal action to redress the harassment. Another new provision covers people who suffer from discrimination by association. Such persons can make a case even if they do not fall into one of the nine specific groups which are covered under the legislation. For example, someone who defends a co-work who is gay from harassment could, in turn, suffer from harassment, that person can take a case to the Equality Tribunal. Another development deals with indirect discrimination where a particular measure while appearing neutral on the face of it, has a disproportionate impact on a particular group or individual in the workplace. Companies are required to monitor the impact of their policies on their employers and adjust their policies to cater for different needs of their employees. ==Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005== This act restated the limit contained in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 1993 prohibiting the granting of social welfare payments to same-sex couples. Some social welfare payments were given to opposite-sex cohabiting couples while more were given to married couples as well as widows and widowers. This has since been changed by the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010. (see below) ==Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 2006== This abolished the legal concept of buggery under the age of 17 and replaced it with a new offence of 'defilement of a child'. Buggery over the age of 17 had been abolished by the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993. The term 'defilement of a child' was gender neutral and this covered sexual intercourse with any person under the age of 17. Sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 15 carries a penalty of life imprisonment, while sexual intercourse with a person between the ages of 15 to 17 carries a penalty of 5 years or 10 if the person is in a position of authority. ==Zappone vs Revenue Commissioners (2006) (High Court)== Commonly known as the KAL case. Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan, who got married in Canada and live in Ireland, took the Revenue Commissioners to court since they refused to recognise their Canadian marriage and for refusing to grant them joint tax assessment. Married couples in Ireland are entitled to have their income jointly assessed as this reduces the overall amount of tax paid. The couple argued that marriage is not defined in the constitution to specify either same sex or opposite sex. They also argued that their rights were being infringed by the lack of recognition of their marriage. The High Court rejected the arguments of the couple. Ms. Justice Dunne did accept that the Irish Constitution does not define marriage as between opposite-sex couples, however, she argued that marriage was traditionally understood to be between a man and a woman and that this understanding of marriage ran through all court cases and legislation about the rights and duties of married couples. Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan initially decided to appeal their case to the Supreme Court. However, they decided to change the grounds of their challenge and this required them to issue a new legal challenge in the High Court. In their original case, they did not challenge the constitutionality of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 which put into law an impediment on two couples of the same sex from getting married. Since the opening up of marriage to same-sex couples under the 34th Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Act 2015 this will arguably make their legal challenge mute .High Court Zappone &Anor.; vs. the Revenue Commissioners & Ors. IECH 404 (2006) ==Options Paper (2006) (Dept. of Justice, Equality and Law Reform)== This was drafted by a working group of former politicians, civil servant and members from relevant NGOs. This working group was established by the then Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform. It was chaired by Anne Colley. This paper examined the various options open to the government in regards to legal recognition of cohabiting couples, both same-sex and opposite-sex. It acknowledged that only the introduction of same-sex marriage would grant full equality for same-sex couples. However, the introduction of same-sex marriage would be constitutionally vulnerable. It recommended that civil partnership be introduced for same-sex couples.Options Paper presented by the Working Group on Domestic Partnership, 2006 ==Report on Cohabiting couples by the Law Reform Commission 2006== In this report, the Law Reform Commission suggested a scheme whereby same-sex and opposite-sex couples who lived together for 3 years (2 years if they have a child) could make arrangements or sign a legally binding contract in regards to taxation, pensions, inheritance, custody and other matters between themselves. Married couples automatically have a wide range of rights, protections, and duties under the law. Same-sex couples, who at the time could not marry, and opposite-sex couples who live together but who choose not to marry do not benefit from many of these rights unless specifically provided so by law. There were very few rights at the time conferred by law to such couples. The report did not propose a scheme such as civil partnership as this would prescribe a fixed bundle of rights and duties and would require cohabiting couples to opt-in. Instead, each couple would be free to sign a cohabiting contract that would have the force of law. On the death or break up of a relationship one or both of the parties could apply to court to get various court orders for payment or property if they are economically dependent. The report recommended that cohabiting couples should have the right to opt out of this arrangement but the courts could lay aside this opt-out if it was judged that this opt-out would cause injustice to a former cohabitant. In this report, the Law Reform Commission repeats the recommendations it gave in its previous consultation paper issued in 2004 but the Commission strengthened the recommendations to allow for a wider range of protections especially those affecting pensions and employment law. It contained a draft bill to allow for the legal recognition of cohabiting couples. Almost all of this draft bill was included as Part 15 of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act, 2010.Law Reform Commission (2006) Report on the Rights and Duties of Cohabitants (LRC 82-2006) Dublin ==Parental Leave (Amendment) Act 2006== Entitles a person to take force majeure leave which is paid time off work to care for their same-sex partner and to make arrangements to have them taken care off in the event of a sudden illness or in an emergency. This did not cover parental leave which was only available to married couples and opposite-sex cohabiting couples until 2016. See Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016. ==European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006== This statutory instrument put into law the EU directive 2004/38/EC. It allows same-sex couples where one person is an EEA national and the other who is a non-EEA national to live in Ireland without the requirement of getting a work permit. The same-sex couple had to be in a relationship for 2 years and the relationship had to be attestable, that is there is proof that the relationship was genuine. This did not cover Irish nationals who were in a relationship with a non-EEA national. In 2008 this loophole was closed and non-EEA national who is cohabiting with an Irish national is not required to get a work permit.Directive 2004/58/EC and Statutory Instrument (S.I.) No. 656 of 2006 European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 ==Treaty of Lisbon 2007== The Treaty of Lisbon was signed in 2007 and came into legal effect on 1 December 2009. In order for the Irish state to ratify the treaty the constitution had to be amended and this required a referendum to be held. The 28th Amendment of the Constitution (Treaty of Lisbon) Act, 2009 amended the constitution to permit ratification. The Treaty of Lisbon gives legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This Charter prohibits any discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of sexual orientation. The Charter is limited in its application to areas of law within the competencies of the EU. It is unclear what consequences this will have vis-√°-vis Section 37 (1) of the Employment Equality Act, 1998 which grants an exemption to religious-run institution to discriminate legally in order to uphold the ethos of their institution. ==Foy v. An t-Ard Chlaraitheoir & Others (2007) (High Court)== Lydia Foy was born male and had a gender reassignment operation in 1992. She had sought to get the Registrar General to recognise her change of gender and issue a new birth certificate in her correct gender. The Registrar General refused to do this. Lydia Foy took the state to the High Court seeking an order to compel the Registrar General to issue a new birth certificate. The initial case was heard in 2000 and in 2002 a judgment was handed down. The High Court refused to order the Registrar General to issue a new birth certificate. Lydia Foy appealed the case to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, a number of other legal developments occurred. In 2002 the European Court of Justice heard a similar case about a transgender woman in the Christine Goodwin v. UK and the European Court of Justice ordered the UK government to recognise Christine Goodwin's new gender and issue a birth certificate. Also, Ireland ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in 2003 and brought its provisions into domestic law. Lydia Foy brought a fresh case to the High Court arguing that her rights under the convention were being breached. In 2007 the High Court found in favour of Lydia Foy and declared that Ireland's law was incompatible with the ECHR and ordered that a new birth certificate be issued to Lydia Foy. The state did seek to appeal the case but in 2010 it dropped the appeal and accepted the outcome. ==Passports Act 2008== This allowed the Passport Office to change the gender on a passport if a person had a gender reassignment operation. This was a first time in law that transgender persons were recognised. ==Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008== With this act, Ireland ratified a number of international conventions on the cooperation of justice systems concerning the arrest and extradition of criminals within the EU, with the United States, and under UN conventions. The Irish state can refuse to provide cooperation if the Minister for Justice believes that to do so will result in a person been punished on the grounds of their sexual orientation. ==McD v. L (High Court) (2008)== In this case, a lesbian couple P.L. and B.M. had a child using sperm donated by J.McD. a gay friend of theirs. They had arranged a contract with J.McD. The role of J.McD. was to act as an ‚Äòuncle‚Äô to the child but not be involved in the daily life of the child. J.McD. went to court to establish guardianship over the child, as its natural father. The High Court refused J.McD.'s application. The High Court upheld the contract agreed by P.L. and B.M. and granted them sole guardianship and custody of the child at the centre of the case. Significantly the High Court acknowledged the lesbian couple and their child as a de facto family who enjoyed the rights granted to families under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The judge also called upon the Oireachtas to legislate for same-sex couple who raise children and recognise them as families.High Court J.McD. vs. P.L. and B.M. (2008) ==European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) (Amendment) Regulations 2008== This amended the 2006 regulations. It removed the requirement that a same-sex couple with one of the partners being a non-EEA national must have been resident in another member state in order to move to Ireland. This meant that an Irish citizen and his or her same-sex partner could move to Ireland. This change of law came about as a result of the Metock Case which was decided at the European Court of Justice. ==Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009== This restated the ban on varying health insurance premiums on the grounds of sexual orientation and on other grounds. It is a similar provision to the Health Insurance Act, 1994 and the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2001. ==McD v. L (Supreme Court) (2009)== The Supreme Court reversed the decision of the High Court. McD was not granted guardianship over the child as its natural father. The Supreme Court held that the family based on marriage was the only family type that is given constitutional recognition and thus refused to recognise the lesbian couple in this case as a family. ==Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010== The Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 allows for same-sex couples to enter a civil partnership on the same terms as married couples. The act deals with a number of areas such as succession of property, pension entitlements, domestic violence, and maintenance in the event of a breakdown of a relationship. The social welfare benefits and the tax entitlements of civil partners were dealt with in other pieces of legislation (see the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2010 and the Finance (No. 3) Act, 2011). The act makes provision for recognition in Ireland of same-sex marriages and civil partnerships performed abroad, however, such unions will only be recognised as civil partners only. The act does not deal with residency of same-sex couples that wish to become civil partnered in Ireland. Civil partners must wait 2 years to get their partnership dissolved. Judicial separation is not allowed. Civil partners were not allowed at the time to adopt jointly through one civil partner was allowed to adopt a child as a single person. Also at the time, civil partners could not have joint guardianship over any children they raised together. This has since been changed under the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. The first public civil partnerships took place in April 2011. With the passing of the marriage equality referendum, the law has changed and same-sex couples cannot now enter a civil partnership. See Marriage Act 2015. The act also provides for legal recognition of cohabiting couples, both opposite-sex and same-sex, where they have been together for 5 years or 2 years if they have a child in common. Cohabiting couples are able to enter into a legally enforceable written contract where they can arrange their affairs on finance and property. Prior to this act, the courts refused to regard any contract between cohabiting couples as legally enforceable. Where a cohabitation relationship ends on breakdown or on death one or both of the cohabitants can apply to court to get a maintenance order, property adjustment order, pension adjustment order and other such orders that married couples can get when they are separating or divorcing, provided that the person bringing the case is or was economically dependent on the other cohabitant. ==Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010== Under this act Civil partners are treated the same as married couples and are entitled to all benefits that married couples can get. Same-sex cohabiting couples are entitled to claim benefits as a 'Qualified Adult' on the same basis as cohabiting opposite-sex couples. Since the coming into effect of this Act same-sex cohabiting couples will have their income jointly assessed when claiming social welfare. Since 2010 civil partners and married couples have been treated the same under subsequent acts on social welfare. ==Finance (No. 3) Act 2011== This act grants civil partners the same tax entitlements as married coupled in income tax, stamp duty (which covers the buying and selling of homes), capital acquisitions tax (which covers the inheritance of property), capital gains tax, value-added tax (VAT) and other taxes and fees. This act covers civil partners only. Same-sex cohabiting couples are not entitled to the same range of tax entitlements and must enter a civil marriage or have entered into a civil partnership to avail of this. Some of the tax entitlements of civil partners have been made retrospective to 1 January 2011 such as capital acquisitions tax and stamp duty. Relief on income tax starts from the date of entry into a civil partnership. Married couples are treated in the same way as they gain relief on income tax from the date of marriage. ==Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011== This is an omnibus act covering many areas. It amends the Domestic Violence Act, 1996. A person who is living or has lived in an intimate and committed same-sex or opposite-sex relationship will be able to apply for a barring order or a safety order. This expands the grounds of relief that a person can get. Previously same-sex couples could only get temporary relief such as stopping orders and interim protection orders. Also, this act will also allow a person to apply for a safety order against a person with whom he or she had a child in common but who have never lived together. ==Finance Act 2012== This act amended the tax code to correct some anomalies between civil partnership and marriage. For example, civil partners might have had to pay tax on any maintenance payments where there is a child or other dependent involved due to separation or divorce. Married couples do not have to pay tax in this circumstance. ==Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency) Act 2012== This act gives the same protections to persons employed by an agency as to those who are directly employed on a temporary basis. The protections on unfair discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and other grounds is the same for agency workers as it is for other employees. ==Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012== This act prohibits the varying of the terms of health insurance policies or the premiums on the grounds of sexual orientation. This is similar to the Health Insurance Act 1994, the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001, and the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2009. ==Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013== This act corrected very minor anomalies between the treatment of married couples and civil partners. ==Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013== This act allowed the press to attend family law cases provided the anonymity of the persons involved is respected. Up until then, all family law cases were held in private. If sensitive personal information is to be shared, the court can refuse the press entry or restrict the publication of any information shared in the court. Information relating to a person's sexual orientation is regarded as sensitive personal information. ==Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014== This act merged the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority together into one body known as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. This act required that as far as possible members of the commission are drawn from the various minority groups including members from the gay and lesbian community. ==Freedom of Information Act 2014== This act allows the general public to have access to information and records kept about them by the civil service, state agencies and by private companies. The act allows information on a person's sexual orientation or their civil status (i.e. that they are married or in a civil partnership) to be kept on record and to be shared. The original Freedom of Information Act, 1997 was amended in 2003 to restrict the information shared and to increase the charges on members of the press and public in accessing information on record. The 2014 act reversed many of the restrictions introduced in 2003. ==Civil Registration (Amendment) Act 2014== This inserted new provisions to prevent civil partnerships of convenience and it allows for civil partnership ceremonies to take place in the embassies of Ireland. ==Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015== This act covers married couples, civil partners, cohabiting couples and people in other types of relationships (both intimate and non-intimate) and single people. ==Children and Family Relationships Act 2015== This act is wide-ranging in its reform of the law regarding children. It provided for the legal regulation and recognition of donor-assisted human reproduction. It changed the law on guardianship of children. Before the act married parent automatically had guardianship rights over their children and the natural mother had automatic guardianship rights. The natural father did not have automatic guardianship rights although he could go to court to establish those rights or the natural mother could extend those rights to him by statutory declaration. This act automatically gives guardianship rights to natural fathers provided that they have been cohabiting with the natural mother for at least 3 months after the birth of a child in common. It also allows same-sex couples, either in a civil partnership or cohabiting, to apply for guardianship rights over any child they are raising together. It also allows for other relatives of a child such as, grandparents, aunts, uncles to also apply for guardianship rights over a child they are raising. The act changed the law on adoption and civil partners and cohabiting couples (either opposite-sex or same-sex) can apply for adoption after they have been living together for 3 years. The act extends adoption leave to civil partners and to cohabiting couples. This act has been modified by the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017. ==Gender Recognition Act 2015== This act provides for the legal recognition of a person's new gender where they have gone through a gender reassignment operation or are about to go through a gender reassignment operation. A person who has changed their gender can get a gender recognition certificate. This certificate entitles a person to have important documentation changed to reflect their new gender such as birth certificates. In general, a person must be over the age of 18 to get a certificate however an exemption to this can be granted by the courts to a person under the age of 18. A person who wishes to change their gender does not have to go through an exhaustive medical or physiological assessment, rather they need their GP to state that they have gone through a gender reassignment operation or they are about to undergo the operation. ==34th Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Act 2015== This act amends the Constitution of Ireland to enable the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament) to pass legislation in order to allow two persons, irrespective of their sex, to get married. The constitution was amended by the insertion of Section 4 of Article 41, which states 'Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.' The proposal was put to the people in a referendum and it was carried with 60% of the electorate voting, 62% voting Yes and 38% voting No. ==Marriage Act 2015== The 34th Amendment of the Constitution requires that the Oireachtas pass a law allowing same-sex couples the right to get married. The Marriage Act 2015 fulfills this requirement and commenced on 16 November 2015. Same-sex couples who wish to marry will have to give 3 months notice, the same as opposite-sex couples. Same-sex couples who entered a civil partnership will remain in that civil partnership. Same-sex couples who are already in a civil partnership can get married by giving 5 days notice. Should any couple in a civil partnership get married then their civil partnership is dissolved. Same-sex couples who got married abroad have had their marriages recognised from 16 November 2015. Since the coming into legal effect of the Marriage Act 2015 same-sex couples are not allowed to enter into a civil partnership in Ireland. The first same- sex couple to get married took place on 17 November 2015. The situation regarding same-sex couples who enter into a civil partnership abroad since 16 November 2015 is unclear as to whether their relationship will be recognised as marriage or as a civil partnership. ==Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015== This act is an omnibus piece of legislation and amends various unrelated laws. This act amends Section 37.1. Section 37.1 as previously worded allowed a religious institution that provides religious, educational or medical services the right to legally discriminate against their employees in order to uphold their ethos. Given that some hospitals and many nursing homes, as well as 98% of primary schools and 52% of secondary schools, are religious run, then a gay or a lesbian teacher, doctor or nurse could have been discriminated against as their sexual orientation could have been seen to undermine the ethos of the school or hospital. This act narrows the scope of Section 37.1. It requires that any employer who wishes to use Section 37.1 must satisfy three tests. These tests are that (1) religion is a genuine occupational requirement of the position, (2) the action is objectively justified and (3) the means of achieving the aim are appropriate and necessary. Any action to take place under Section 37.1 must be about the conduct of the employee and not about their sexual orientation. Also, employees who work in religious-run institutions enjoy a right to privacy. ==European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2015== This regulation transposes into Irish law the EU Directive 2004/38/EC. This provides an updated regulation on the right of residency. The Regulations provide for the facilitation of entry and residence for EU citizens and their family members. The Regulations also provide for a wider definition of \\"family member\\", to include a partner with whom the EU citizen has a durable relationship, duly attested, and the dependent parents, children under 21 and other dependent children of that partner. This does not involve the recognition of such partnerships for other purposes. ==International Protection Act 2015== A person can claim asylum based on fear of prosecution arising from their sexual orientation. ==LGBT Youth Strategy== As part of its programme for government, the newly elected minority government has promised to devise an LGBT Youth Strategy. The strategy is to focus on equality of opportunities, education, preventative health care, and support services. The Programme for Government states ‚ÄòWe will develop an LGBT Youth Strategy that will encompass education, youth services, mental health and other issues. As part of this strategy, we will review the implementation of the National Action Plan on Bullying in our schools.‚Äô The Minister for Children Katherine Zappone in May 2016 stated that she hoped the LGBT Youth Strategy would be published in one years time. ==Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016== This extends paternity leave from 3 days to 2 weeks. It allows paternity leave to be combined with maternity leave and adoptive leave in certain tragic circumstances. Same-sex couples are treated the same as opposite-sex couples. ==Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill 2016== The Republic of Ireland is somewhat unusual in that it does not have a hate crimes law. Ireland does have the Prohibition of Incitement To Hatred Act 1989, which prohibits incitement to hatred but that law is difficult to enforce. It is unclear if there have been any successful convictions under the 1989 Act. Under the Criminal Justice (Aggravation by Prejudice) Bill 2016 if a person is convicted of an offence the courts may determine that that offence was caused by a hatred towards a person and may impose a higher sentence if the courts deem that appropriate. Sufficient evidence will have to be given in the court for an offence to be considered an aggravated offence. The bill does not set out any minimum penalties. The bill names disability, sexual orientation and transgender identity as grounds for an aggravated offence. As this is a private member bill it remains to be seen if it will pass through the Oireachtas. ==Modification of the Blood Ban 2016== Ireland introduced a ban on all men who have sex with men from donating blood. It was a ban for life. This ban was introduced in 1985 at the height of the AIDS crisis. The Minister for Health announced that the ban will be eased in light of evidence that has emerged in recent decades. Men who have sex with men will be able to donate blood provided they have abstained from sexual intercourse for at least one year. Men who have a history of sexually transmitted diseases will have to wait for five years to donate. This measure has been welcomed as a progressive step by GLEN (Gay and Lesbian Equality Network) however they note that the new measure still discriminates against men who are in a committed and sexually active relationship. Others have criticised the ban as not based on science and that the deferral period is too long and still re-inforces stigma on gay men and MSM people. ==Convictions for Certain Sexual Offences (Apology and Exoneration) Bill 2016== This bill proposes that all men convicted of buggery or gross indecency under previous criminal law be exonerated from their conviction and that they are given an apology. The basis for the exoneration and apology is that it was wrong for the State to have prosecuted men who had consensual sexual acts with other men. The bill goes onto state that the apology and exoneration do not give cause to sue the State nor does it impose a liability on the State. This law does not apply to convictions for sexual acts with minors. If this bill passes into law the criminal records of men who were convicted will not be expunged as there is no facility for this to happen. Such men will continue to have a criminal record despite the exoneration and apology. Some concern has been raised over non-consensual sexual acts between adult men in the past. A motion before the Oireachtas is due on the 25th anniversary of decriminalisation. The Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has stated that there are complications regarding the passing of this bill mainly on how to distinguish cases involving consenting adults and cases involving minors. ==Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017== This act legislates for the 31st Amendment of the Constitution (Children) Act, 2012. The act allows civil partners and same-sex married couples the right to apply for adoption. Children in long-term foster care can be adopted and step-parents may apply to adopt their spouses' child. Civil partners were given the right to apply for adoption under the Child and Family Relationships Act 2015. ==Gender Recognition (Amendment) Bill 2017== This bill proposes to amend the Gender Recognition Act 2015. At present, a person aged 16 to 18 years must receive a court order, parental consent and the intervention of medical professionals before they can be issued a gender recognition certificate after a gender reassignment surgery. Under this bill, a person aged 16 to 18 will be treated the same as a person 18 years or older. It also proposes to amend the procedure for persons under the age of 16 who will normally have to get parental permission to undergo gender reassignment surgery. A court can dispense with parental consent if the court decides that the refusal of parental consent would not be in the best interests of the child. This bill will also empower the Minister for Justice to review the Gender Recognition Act in order to grant gender recognition certificates to persons who do not identify as exclusively male or female after a gender reassignment surgery. ==Provision of Objective Sex Education Bill 2018== The purpose of this bill is to require all primary and secondary schools to provide objective and fact- based sex education irrespective of the religious ethos of the school. At present sex education in primary and secondary schools is taught by the Relationship and Sexuality Education (RSE) Programme. RSE was introduced in 1999. Schools can modify the RSE programme in line with their ethos. The existing RSE programme has been criticised as being too heterosexist in nature as LGBT sexuality is ignored. Also, implementation of the RSE programme has been shown to be very inconsistent. This bill will require schools to teach an objective and fact-based sexuality programme that is inclusive of LGBT sexuality and gender issues and schools will not be able to use their ethos to prevent such sex education from happening. ==Domestic Violence Act 2018== The purpose of this Act is to amend and consolidate the law in relation to domestic violence. This Act consolidates the provisions contained in the Domestic Violence Act 1996, the Domestic Violence (Amendment) Act 2002 and relevant provisions of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015. This Act also includes new provisions which must be enacted in order for Ireland to be able to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, more commonly known as the Istanbul Convention. Ireland signed the Istanbul Convention in November 2015. These new provisions include allowing a person to apply for an emergency barring order where that person has lived in an intimate and committed relationship with the respondent without being their spouse or civil partner or where that person is the parent of an adult respondent, and the inclusion of a provision to criminalise forced marriage. This Act also removes the underage marriage exemption in order to help to protect minors against forced marriage, as requiring both intended spouses to be at least 18 should assist in ensuring that potential spouses have the maturity to withstand parental or other pressure to marry a particular person. ==Prohibition of Conversion Therapies Bill 2018== This bill will prohibit any counsellor, care worker, teacher, doctor, psychologist and other medical and mental health professionals from seeking to change a person's sexual orientation especially to 'cure homosexuality'. The penalty is a fine of ‚Ç¨1,000 to ‚Ç¨5,000 or a six-month jail sentence. ==Apology for Persons Convicted of Consensual Same-sex Acts: Motion== This motion was passed by the Oireachtas on 19 June 2018. The motion was moved by the Taoiseach Leo Varakadar. The motion apologised to all men convicted under the law that criminalised same-sex acts. The State acknowledges that it was wrong to criminalise and prosecute men. The motion also acknowledged the chilling effected these laws had on the wider LGBT community in creating and fostering social stigma. ==Education (Admission to Schools) Act 2018== This act deals with the admission policy to primary schools, post-primary schools, and third level educational institutions. It prohibits educational institutions from refusing a pupil entry on a number of grounds including sexual orientation. It prohibits Catholic-run schools from giving preference to baptised Catholics over non-baptised children. However religious-run schools that are of a minority religion can continue to refuse admission to a pupil if they are not of the same religion of the school. Such minority religions are Church of Ireland (Anglican), Muslim, Jewish and so on. At the moment 89% of state- funded primary school are Catholic-run and 52% of state-funded post-primary schools are religious run. This means that on the religion ground many students could be discriminated against. This has proved to be controversial for students and parents who have no religion and for the Catholic Church. The Act has been commenced and from 1 September 2019 Catholic school may not refuse admission on the grounds of baptism. ==Children and Family Relationship (Amendment) Act 2018== This act modifies Parts 2 and 3 of the Children and Family Relationship Act 2015, which have yet to be commenced. Parts 2 and 3 of the principal act deal with surrogacy. This amending bill makes minor technical changes which would allow some families who have conceived their children by surrogacy to gain legal recognition over their children in limited circumstances. ==Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Act, 2018== This Act brings into effect many of the social welfare changes announced in Budget 2018. In addition, in a move anticipated by the Minister before the budget, a provision has been inserted in the Act which clarifies the survivor pension rights of same-sex couples. Some pension schemes only grant a survivor pension to the spouse of an employee where the employee has married his/her spouse either before s/he retired or s/he reached a particular age (e.g. 60). LGBT employees who had retired before the introduction of Marriage Equality in 2015 and who were unable to marry their partners at that time lost the benefit. A change in the law to benefit older LGBT people was supported by all parties. The ameliorating provision in the Act provides that if the retired employee was in a committed relationship with a same-sex partner at the time they retired or reached a particular age and then married that partner within 3 years of the enactment of the Marriage Act 2015 they are deemed to be eligible for a survivor pension on the payment of the appropriate contributions. The provision is not retrospective as the committed relationship referred to in the Act is not, itself, recognised as a marriage by the State. (The Act resolves, inter alia, the issue in the David Parris case. The Act has similar provisions for civil partners. ==Civil Registration Act 2019== This act has a number of unrelated provisions. One of the provisions is to make technical changes to the law to allow some female couples to have their details registered in the register of births, where they have a child in common. This bill applies only to female couples where they conceive in an Irish fertility clinic using an identifiable donor. Male couples are excluded from this bill as are couples where a person in the relationship is undergoing a gender transition. Same-sex couples who use a donor from abroad or use surrogacy are not recognised. ==Parental Leave and Benefit Act 2019== Due to an anomaly in the law male same-sex couples were not able to receive adoption leave and benefits although they were allowed to apply to adopt children. This law corrects that anomaly. This law gave parental leave to all couples (opposite sex, same sex, married, civil partnered, cohabiting) who have a child by natural means or who are having a child under donor conceived child. Adoption leave is 24 weeks leave from work paid through social welfare in order to allow a prospective parent bond with their newly adopted child. ==See also== *LGBT rights in the Republic of Ireland *List of LGBT rights by region *Recognition of same-sex unions in Ireland *Homosexuality laws of the world *List of Acts of the Oireachtas ==References== Category:LGBT rights in the Republic of Ireland Laws and reports on LGBT rights in Ireland LGBT ","title":"List of laws and reports on LGBT rights in the Republic of Ireland"},{"id":"20171334","text":"The Impact Nominal Index or INI is a computer system that enables UK police forces to establish whether any other force holds information on a person of interest.

The game was held on Saturday, August 22, 2009. As part of the league's tenth anniversary celebrations, the game was held at the neutral-site Orleans Arena (within the Orleans Resort & Casino) in Las Vegas. Because of legal issues regarding the ownership of arenafootball2 (the original Arena Football League had owned a controlling stake), the league legally disbanded two weeks after the game was played because of the parent's bankruptcy. AF2's board of directors formed a new entity, Arena Football One, that assumed the Arena Football League identity after winning a bankruptcy court sale in late 2009. Future championships for that league which, while \\"new\\", consists of AF2's board of directors, use the ArenaBowl as its championship, leading to the retirement of the ArenaCup. The \\"new\\" Arena Football League began in 2010 with the defending champion Shock moving up. They went on to defeat the Tampa Bay Storm in ArenaBowl XXIII, thus winning consecutive titles in the premier level in consecutive years, with different league identities. ==References *2009 af2 stats Category:Af2 seasons Arena ","title":"2009 AF2 season"},{"id":"20171391","text":"Rob Epstein, also credited as Robert P.

Obituary from the Oregonian, 1904 Barlow arrived in Oregon as a young man in 1845. He purchased land and founded the town of Canemah, now part of Oregon City, Oregon. When William and his brother James were tending the toll gate on the Barlow Road in 1847, they met their brides-to-be, Rachel and Rebecca Larkins, the pretty young daughters of William E. Larkins and his wife, Rachel Reed. On August 20, 1848, William married Rachel. Sadly, Rachel died a month later. In 1852 he married widow Mrs. Martha Ann Allen; they had three children: Mary, Virginia and Cassius. Sometime after 1848, Barlow purchased a land claim from his father Sam Barlow for $6,000. In 1891, he founded the town of Barlow on that land. His residence, now known as the Barlow House, still stands near Barlow. ==See also== *Barlow Road ==References== Category:Oregon pioneers Category:People from Oregon City, Oregon Category:1822 births Category:1904 deaths ","title":"William Barlow (pioneer)"},{"id":"20171419","text":"In probability theory and directional statistics, a wrapped normal distribution is a wrapped probability distribution that results from the \\"wrapping\\" of the normal distribution around the unit circle. It finds application in the theory of Brownian motion and is a solution to the heat equation for periodic boundary conditions. It is closely approximated by the von Mises distribution, which, due to its mathematical simplicity and tractability, is the most commonly used distribution in directional statistics. ==Definition== The probability density function of the wrapped normal distribution is : f_{WN}(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma \\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi}} \\\\sum^{\\\\infty}_{k=-\\\\infty} \\\\exp \\\\left[\\\\frac{-(\\\\theta - \\\\mu + 2\\\\pi k)^2}{2 \\\\sigma^2} \\\\right], where Œº and œÉ are the mean and standard deviation of the unwrapped distribution, respectively. Expressing the above density function in terms of the characteristic function of the normal distribution yields: : f_{WN}(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma)=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty e^{-\\\\sigma^2n^2/2+in(\\\\theta-\\\\mu)} =\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\vartheta\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\theta-\\\\mu}{2\\\\pi},\\\\frac{i\\\\sigma^2}{2\\\\pi}\\\\right) , where \\\\vartheta(\\\\theta,\\\\tau) is the Jacobi theta function, given by : \\\\vartheta(\\\\theta,\\\\tau)=\\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty (w^2)^n q^{n^2} \\\\text{ where } w \\\\equiv e^{i\\\\pi \\\\theta} and q \\\\equiv e^{i\\\\pi\\\\tau} . The wrapped normal distribution may also be expressed in terms of the Jacobi triple product: :f_{WN}(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma)=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\prod_{n=1}^\\\\infty (1-q^n)(1+q^{n-1/2}z)(1+q^{n-1/2}/z) . where z=e^{i(\\\\theta-\\\\mu)}\\\\, and q=e^{-\\\\sigma^2}. == Moments == In terms of the circular variable z=e^{i\\\\theta} the circular moments of the wrapped normal distribution are the characteristic function of the normal distribution evaluated at integer arguments: :\\\\langle z^n\\\\rangle=\\\\int_\\\\Gamma e^{in\\\\theta}\\\\,f_{WN}(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma)\\\\,d\\\\theta = e^{i n \\\\mu-n^2\\\\sigma^2/2}. where \\\\Gamma\\\\, is some interval of length 2\\\\pi. The first moment is then the average value of z, also known as the mean resultant, or mean resultant vector: : \\\\langle z \\\\rangle=e^{i\\\\mu-\\\\sigma^2/2} The mean angle is : \\\\theta_\\\\mu=\\\\mathrm{Arg}\\\\langle z \\\\rangle = \\\\mu and the length of the mean resultant is : R=\\\\langle z \\\\rangle = e^{-\\\\sigma^2/2} The circular standard deviation, which is a useful measure of dispersion for the wrapped normal distribution and its close relative, the von Mises distribution is given by: : s=\\\\ln(R^{-2})^{1/2} = \\\\sigma == Estimation of parameters == A series of N measurements zn = e iŒ∏n drawn from a wrapped normal distribution may be used to estimate certain parameters of the distribution. The average of the series is defined as :\\\\overline{z}=\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^N z_n and its expectation value will be just the first moment: :\\\\langle\\\\overline{z}\\\\rangle=e^{i\\\\mu-\\\\sigma^2/2}. \\\\, In other words, is an unbiased estimator of the first moment. If we assume that the mean Œº lies in the interval [‚àíœÄ, œÄ), then Arg will be a (biased) estimator of the mean Œº. Viewing the zn as a set of vectors in the complex plane, the 2 statistic is the square of the length of the averaged vector: :\\\\overline{R}^2=\\\\overline{z}\\\\,\\\\overline{z^*}=\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\cos\\\\theta_n\\\\right)^2+\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\sum_{n=1}^N \\\\sin\\\\theta_n\\\\right)^2 \\\\, and its expected value is: :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\overline{R}^2\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{1}{N}+\\\\frac{N-1}{N}\\\\,e^{-\\\\sigma^2}\\\\, In other words, the statistic :R_e^2=\\\\frac{N}{N-1}\\\\left(\\\\overline{R}^2-\\\\frac{1}{N}\\\\right) will be an unbiased estimator of e‚àíœÉ2, and ln(1/Re2) will be a (biased) estimator of œÉ2 == Entropy == The information entropy of the wrapped normal distribution is defined as: :H = -\\\\int_\\\\Gamma f_{WN}(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma)\\\\,\\\\ln(f_{WN}(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma))\\\\,d\\\\theta where \\\\Gamma is any interval of length 2\\\\pi. Defining z=e^{i(\\\\theta-\\\\mu)} and q=e^{-\\\\sigma^2}, the Jacobi triple product representation for the wrapped normal is: :f_{WN}(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma) = \\\\frac{\\\\phi(q)}{2\\\\pi}\\\\prod_{m=1}^\\\\infty (1+q^{m-1/2}z)(1+q^{m-1/2}z^{-1}) where \\\\phi(q)\\\\, is the Euler function. The logarithm of the density of the wrapped normal distribution may be written: :\\\\ln(f_{WN}(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma))= \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\phi(q)}{2\\\\pi}\\\\right)+\\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty\\\\ln(1+q^{m-1/2}z)+\\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty\\\\ln(1+q^{m-1/2}z^{-1}) Using the series expansion for the logarithm: :\\\\ln(1+x)=-\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^k}{k}\\\\,x^k the logarithmic sums may be written as: :\\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty\\\\ln(1+q^{m-1/2}z^{\\\\pm 1})=-\\\\sum_{m=1}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^k}{k}\\\\,q^{mk-k/2}z^{\\\\pm k} = -\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^k}{k}\\\\,\\\\frac{q^{k/2}}{1-q^k}\\\\,z^{\\\\pm k} so that the logarithm of density of the wrapped normal distribution may be written as: :\\\\ln(f_{WN}(\\\\theta;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma))=\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\phi(q)}{2\\\\pi}\\\\right)-\\\\sum_{k=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^k}{k} \\\\frac{q^{k/2}}{1-q^k}\\\\,(z^k+z^{-k}) which is essentially a Fourier series in \\\\theta\\\\,.

The shape of the building is designed to optimize views between currently standing buildings, includes a parking garage hidden behind the main structure and has of office space with floor to ceiling windows. There are a total of 6,257 pieces of structural steel and bracing in the structure and wiring that stretches . Atop the building is a glass veil that is illuminated with different colors at various times of the year. The building cost $125 million (equivalent to $ million in ) and took nearly two years to complete. ===LEED Certification=== Originally, the building was expected to earn LEED Silver certification, but along the way improvements were made and the building ultimately earned LEED Gold certification. ===Architect=== The building was designed by architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (SOM). SOM has also designed buildings such as the Willis Tower in Chicago, the Burj Khalifa in the United Arab Emirates (the world's current tallest building), and the Air Force Academy Chapel in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Colorado. SOM also designed the One World Trade Center, which was built near where the destroyed World Trade Center once stood. ==History== Construction on the building was completed in December 2009. The building was facing serious occupancy issues, with the pre-lease rate remaining at around 25% but rates subsequently increased, especially with the largely publicized lease announcement of Goldman Sachs. The building eventually became fully occupied. In February 2014, the property's original owners (and current building manager), Hamilton Partners, sold the building to KBS Real Estate Investment Trust III (KBS) for $170.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) in \\"a record-setting deal for commercial real estate in Utah's capital city, on a cost per-square footage basis.\\" At the time of purchase, KBS already owned the Parkside Tower and Gateway Tech Center in Salt Lake City. ==See also== * Buildings and sites of Salt Lake City, Utah * List of tallest buildings in Salt Lake City * Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ==ReferencesDowntown Rising's 222 Main webpage * Skidmore, Owings & Merrill * KBS's 222 Main webpage * Hamilton Partners' 222 Main webpage * U.S. Green Building Council * U.S. Green Building Council ‚Äì Utah Chapter Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Salt Lake City Category:Skidmore, Owings & Merrill buildings Category:Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design gold certified buildings ","title":"222 Main"},{"id":"20171469","text":"Lwamondo is a village in the Vhembe District Municipality, of Limpopo Province, South Africa.

He served in Gallipoli, Palestine and Egypt and was awarded the Military Cross.Obituary, The Times (London, England), 26 February 1988 Following the war, he went up to Pembroke College, Oxford, where he became President of the Oxford Union. At Oxford he first took to the stage, appearing in Antony and Cleopatra with Cathleen Nesbitt, whom he married in 1921. They had two children. Instead of taking up acting as a profession after university, Ramage read law. He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple, and practised on the Oxford Circuit. At the 1922 general election he was the Liberal candidate for the constituency of Newcastle West, but was defeated by David Adams of the Labour Party. Another election was held in 1923 and Ramage stood again and was elected as Member of Parliament (MP). He was only to be in the Commons for a short period, as he was defeated at the subsequent general election in 1924. He was the Liberal candidate at Southport at the 1929 general election, but failed to be elected. By this time Ramage was a professional actor, appearing in New York, the West End of London and toured with the Old Vic Company in the Mediterranean. He had a number of minor roles in films, including Secret of Stamboul (1936), Nicholas Nickleby (1947) and Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949). His career eventually declined, and he retired from the stage and was separated from his wife, Nesbitt, who died in 1982, aged 93. He played the Crown Counsel in Kind Hearts and Coronets, whose devastating cross-examination of Louis Mazzini does much to discredit him. ==Death== Cecil Beresford Ramage died in 1988, aged 93.

The main contenders were incumbent President of Kenya, Mwai Kibaki and his former ally Raila Odinga. The election was strongly marked by tribalism,See Kenyan presidential election, 2007 for more information with Kibaki coming from the most numerous Kikuyu ethnic group which has dominated Kenyan politics since independence and Odinga an ethnic Luo allied with other smaller ethnic groups. Kibaki was declared the winner and sworn in on 30 December, despite opposition leader Raila Odinga's claims of victory. Odinga and many international observers claimed the elections were at least partially manipulated. Following the declaration, violent protests erupted particularly in Kibera, and this included ethnic violence targeted against Kikuyu people living outside their traditional settlement areas, especially in the Rift Valley Province. Luos and Kalenjin were also targeted in the areas surrounding Nakuru and Naivasha. Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan brokered a power-sharing agreement which included the appointment of the Waki Commission to investigate the violence. == Composition == The chairman of the Commission was Justice Philip Waki, a Judge of Kenya's Court of Appeal. The other two commission members were Gavin Alistair McFadyen, a former police Assistant Commissioner in New Zealand and Pascal K.

Portrayed by Steve Huison, the character's first appearance on-screen was broadcast on 14 November 2008. On 5 December 2010, it was announced that Eddie was to leave Coronation Street in spring 2011 after being axed by producer Phil Collinson. Huison made his final appearance as Eddie on 25 April 2011. This was Huison's second role in the soap; he previously played criminal Andy Morgan in 2003. ==CreationBackground=== The character of Eddie was created as part of a new family unit that new producer Kim Crowther introduced to the soap opera, consisting of a mother, a father, a son and an uncle. They were originally billed as a storyline device for established character David Platt. An ITV spokesperson said of the character and his onscreen family: \\"The Windass family are very rough and ready, always ducking and diving. Early on they get involved with David Platt when he helps to fit a new kitchen in the Windass family home. However, Anna thinks the work is shoddy and refuses to pay for it. David goes round, rips out the kitchen and sets fire to it outside the family‚Äôs house.\\" Fellow cast member Debbie Rush spoke about their odd surname and stated they were expecting comments when seen in public about it. ==DevelopmentPersonality and identity=== Speaking of his character Huison said: \\"Eddie‚Äôs a great character to play, he thinks he‚Äôs hard and head of the family, but he‚Äôs always one step behind Gary and Len. Eddie is always up to silly scams. He uses crutches but you may notice he doesn‚Äôt always limp with the same leg‚Ä¶\\" ==Storylines== The character's storylines start immediately after his first on-screen appearance when David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) and his boss Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale) confront him and his family about a bounced cheque that they had used to pay for their fitted kitchen. Several weeks later, the Windasses move into Coronation Street after renting No. 6 from Jerry Morton (Michael Starke). After Anna nags him to find a job, Eddie gets a job as a taxi driver at Streetcars, but is reluctant to hand over any paperwork to Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), due to fiddling Incapacity Benefit. Eddie plans to start up a darts team, but once he collects the money from the team, he tells them that he's been mugged and lost all the money. Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) is disgusted and accuses him of going back to his old scheming ways., Eddie's plan backfires when Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment) approaches him a few days later, telling him that he has spoken to everyone and they have agreed to keep the team going, since it means so much to Eddie. The Rovers' team consists of Dark Destroyer Eddie, Kirk, Kevin (Michael Le Vell) and Bill Webster (Peter Armitage), Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) and Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles). Eddie's ruse is uncovered when a visiting darts team arrive at the Rover's to play against his team. The rival team's captain recognises him as Eddie had tried a similar scam two years earlier and the team chase him. In May 2009, Eddie overhears Roy Cropper (David Neilson) giving Anna the Roy's Rolls password and account number for the Cash and Carry. He deviously takes the details from his wife's handbag and buys alcohol under the pretence that he is working for Roy. He is the Cash and Carry's one-millionth customer and wins a city break to Europe. He tells Anna that he is taking her away for a romantic break and that he has been putting money aside to pay for it. However, Eddie's lie is exposed when Roy's wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh) sees a cardboard cutout of \\"Roy Cropper\\" as the millionth customer at the Cash n' Carry. Eddie is then barred from the cafe by his wife. In July 2009, it is revealed that Eddie and Anna are not in fact married, as he proposes to her. She rejects him and it becomes clear that he has proposed to her many times before in the past. Eddie and Anna deal with son Gary for most of 2009. He goes to prison after a robbery setup, orchestrated by David Platt, and after his release, becomes interested in joining the army. Eddie is reluctant to show emotion but bakes a cake to show Gary how proud he is. Several months later, Gary goes AWOL after a friend loses limbs in battle. Eventually Eddie calls the military police and tells them Gary is at home, because he feels his son needs to face up to his responsibilities. When Gary is away from home, Anna begins keeping an eye on Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) when he's having family problems. Anna decides she wants to adopt a child, and Eddie warms to the idea. They begin a competition with Steve and Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly), who also want to adopt. In early-2011, Eddie and Anna begin fostering nine-year-old Faye Butler (Ellie Leach). Faye proves to be a handful for the Windasses as she doesn't take to her new home right away, her presence leads to tension between the couple and Eddie reveals he never actually wanted to adopt. Eddie pleads with Anna to send Faye back, but Anna refuses to give up on her. When Len (Conor Ryan) offers Eddie a job in Germany, he gives Anna an ultimatum to choose between him or Faye. Anna is appalled Eddie has placed her in such a position, and tells him that given the choice, she'd choose Faye every time. With this, the couple end their relationship and Eddie packs his bags before saying goodbye to Gary and leaving Weatherfield for Germany. ==Reception== Grace Dent of The Guardian slated the character because of his scrounging ways and shoddy appearance stating: \\"Gary's dad Eddie has no positive attributes to speak of. None. He's six feet tall with a collapsed orange Sideshow Bob hairdo and an ambidextrous limp which switches from left to right leg depending on which Social Security officer is spying on him. He has a permanently fuddled expression which could be down to Temazepam, plain idiocy or the fact all his good brain cells are engaged in working out how to rob your wallet.\\" Tony Stewart of The Mirror also describes Eddie's character as a scrounger. MSN branded Eddie and his family as chavs and being perfect guests for the Jeremy Kyle show, and going on to calling them a million miles away from lower class yobbish families 'The Mortons' and 'The Battersbys'. Whereas Simon Swift of Soaplife magazine commented on the fact that on first looks he couldn't help feeling that Eddie and his clan are a bit too much like original neighbours- from-hell the Battersbys. Kris Green of media website Digital Spy praised and commented on the fact that the Windass clan had 'settled in so well, in such a short space of time', with fellow actor Mikey North stating that their success is down to the good writing and many plotlines the family received in the short time period. Upon the broadcast of Eddie's final episodes in April 2011, Jane Simon of The Daily Mirror wrote that she is \\"gutted\\" to see the character depart the show and adds that she hopes \\"the Corrie bosses see sense and decide to glue the Windass family back together before too long\\". ==References * Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Fictional taxicab drivers Category:Television characters introduced in 2008 Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional people from Manchester ","title":"Eddie Windass"},{"id":"20171539","text":"The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Hughes 4-6-4T was a class of steam locomotives.

The character was introduced in the episode first broadcast on 14 November 2008. Rush announced her decision to leave the series in July 2017 and Anna departed in the episode first broadcast on 22 January 2018. She appeared in two further episodes first broadcast on 31 May to 1 June 2018. Anna's storylines have included: a rocky relationship to her long-term partner, Eddie Windass (Steve Huison); feuds with the Platt family, Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine) and Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor); her wayward son Gary's (Mikey North) decision to enroll into the army; her turbulent relationship with Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies); adopting Faye Butler (Ellie Leach), who later alleges that Anna is abusing her; being blackmailed by Owen's client-turned-business partner Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre) into having sex with him; facing bankruptcy following the end of her relationship with Owen; coping with Faye's underage pregnancy; a relationship with Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell); getting severely burnt in a car explosion unwittingly caused by Gary's old rival David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd); and being framed by Phelan for pushing his apprentice and Faye's boyfriend Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) off a ladder, which resulted in her wrongful five- years imprisonment off-screen . The character was released off-screen after Phelan's crimes were finally exposed, and Anna returned for her two final episodes; the first in 31 May 2018 where she rescues Gary and his girlfriend Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien) from Phelan's captivity, and the second in 1 June 2018 where she ultimately kills Phelan by mortally stabbing him with a knife after he shot his own daughter Nicola Rubinstein (Nicola Thorp) and then local resident Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh) with a gun. After killing Phelan at the climax of his siege, Anna decided to leave Weatherfield - thus concluding the character's story arc. ==Storylines== Anna first appears on screen with her long-term boyfriend Eddie (Steve Huison) when they refuse to pay Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale) for a kitchen refit. David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) then tries to force them to pay but after they refuse, he makes a number of threats, resulting in David, Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) and Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey) setting fire to the Windasses' kitchen. The Windass family move into No. 6 Coronation Street with the rest of her family. She has a heart-to-heart with new neighbour Gail Platt (Helen Worth) to make peace as she wants a fresh start in Coronation Street even though their families are feuding and convinces Eddie to make peace with Gail's partner, Joe. This ends badly at Christmas, as Gail's invitation for the Windasses to stop in for dinner soon leads to Joe throwing food at them and forcing them out of the house. As the New Year begins, Anna is dismayed as she senses Eddie sinking back into his con artist ways and she always objects to them as her character shows her desire to live a free life without having to steal and scrounge money from society, and as the feud between her son Gary (Mikey North) and David Platt grows more volatile. In March 2009, she is relieved when Gary is cleared of assaulting David and Anna attempts to influence Gail and Tina to make David drop the charges. She is also seen breaking down on a number of occasions, trying to hold her family together. In April 2009, Roy Cropper (David Neilson) gives Anna a job in the caf√©. Initially, Roy's wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh) is skeptical but is impressed by Anna's work ethic and she continues to work there. Hayley also takes Anna's side when Eddie steals and poses as Roy in a scam to receive free alcohol from the cash-and-carry. Anna is dismayed in 2010 when Gary decides that he wants to join the army. Fearing for his life on the front line, she eventually comes to terms with his career decision. However, Anna is later dismayed when Gary is reported as being AWOL, after she comforts him over his secret fears he returns to duty. 2010 also sees Anna and Eddie looking into adopting a child. Anna's nephew, Rory visits while his parents are on holiday. Eddie is seen pushing Rory round in a pram, upsetting Becky as she thinks that Anna and Eddie have been given a child. In early 2011, young Faye Windass (Ellie Leach) comes to stay with Anna and Eddie, with a view towards them becoming her foster parents. Faye is quite a troubled young girl and this causes a rift between Anna and Eddie as he becomes discouraged with fostering. Anna is adamant that she will support Faye, particularly after her biological mother is found dead, following a drug overdose. Eddie breaks the tragic news in quite a clumsy way to Faye and this angers Anna. Eventually, Eddie issues Anna with an ultimatum: him or Faye. Anna chooses Faye and Eddie moves to Germany as a result. After Eddie's departure, Anna gets close to Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), whose daughter Izzy (Cherylee Houston) is dating Gary. Anna is dismayed when she discovers that her landlord Jerry Morton (Michael Starke) is planning to sell No. 6. Unable to afford to buy the house, she is worried as Faye has finally found stability in her new home. Owen, much to Anna's surprise, buys the house and becomes her new landlord. This brings them closer together, making Faye jealous as she fears that Owen will take Anna away from her. Their relationship goes well, and Anna supports Owen after he discovers his 16 year old daughter Katy (Georgia May Foote) is pregnant and later helps deliver her son Joseph on Christmas Eve 2011. Owen and Anna's relationship is later tested, after Anna goes away to visit her brother; Owen looks after Faye and after discovering that Faye had poisoned the fish he had bought for Anna's garden, slapped her. Faye locked herself in her room, and upon Anna's return ‚Äì the couple split, with Anna unable to forgive Owen for hitting Faye. Anna's son, Gary, and Owen's daughter, Izzy, later discover that Izzy is pregnant. The pair are overjoyed but Izzy later miscarries. Due to her disability, they approach Izzy's younger sister Katy about being a surrogate mother, and she and Owen reconcile. Izzy is told that Katy is not a suitable candidate for surrogacy as she is too young. Chesney, Katy's partner, also objects and Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) offers to be surrogate instead, and the family discover that the implantation has worked and Tina is pregnant in December 2012. Anna is stunned to learn that Gary has developed a crush on Tina after discovering he bought her late father's wedding ring at a pawn shop after it was stolen. Anna keeps this secret, but Gary takes things too far when he tries to kiss Tina, but she rejects him. Izzy learns of this and Tina goes into premature labour. Tina gives birth to Gary and Izzy's baby son, \\"Jake\\", but Izzy does not want Gary to see him because of his betrayal. After seeing Gary and Izzy argue, Tina decides to keep the baby and raise him with her boyfriend, Tommy Duckworth (Chris Fountain). This leads to Anna insulting Tina on numerous occasions. When Gary tells Anna how long it could take to get residency, Anna storms into The Rovers and slaps Tina for taking \\"Jake\\", renamed Joe. Izzy and Gary are terrified that Tina will report Anna to Social Services, but she doesn't. Later, Izzy and Gary decide not to fight Tina but Tommy, Rita and Dennis convince Tina to allow \\"Joe\\" to be raised by his biological parents. Anna is also stressed when Faye decides to live with her biological father, Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine). When Anna bans Faye from seeing Tim, she lies to Brian Packham (Peter Gunn), telling him that Anna hits her at home. Social workers Nicola Waite (Maxine Burth) and Stephen Bowyer (Dana Haqjoo) arrive to question Anna and Faye, who reveals that Anna has never hit her. Anna allows Faye to move in with Tim, making Anna break down in Owen's arms. When Tim goes on a trip to Newcastle for work, Faye tells him that she will stay with Anna and Owen but stays at Tim's flat alone. Faye is later caught stealing from Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) shop by Mary Taylor (Patti Clare) and Sophie Webster (Brooke Vincent). Mary and Sophie tell Owen and Anna. Anna feeds Faye and gives her a shower, before angrily confronting Tim about leaving Faye home alone. Tim begins a relationship with Anna's next-door neighbour Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor), causing friction between the two women. Anna grows annoyed when Tim and Sally are constantly buying new things that impress Faye. Sally decides to have a garden party on the same day that Anna is planning on having a barbecue, which leads to further friction and the guests being torn on which barbecue to attend, especially Roy and Hayley, as Sally is a close friend and Anna is their employee. When Anna runs out of tomato ketchup, she uses Sally's without permission, leading to a physical fight as Anna is on one side of the fence and Sally is on the other. The fight ends in disaster, however, when Sally and Anna go flying into Anna's back garden with the fence, smashed up and ruined. Anna helps out at the Croppers' upon discovering that Hayley has been diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer. A few months later, Hayley collapses at home and is rushed to hospital. Anna does her best to look out for Roy but he accidentally spills the beans on Hayley's suicide wish, leaving Anna stunned. Roy is extremely guilty that he has confided in Anna about Hayley's privacy, and orders her not to say anything to anybody about it. When Roy is decorating his and Hayley's bedroom, Anna gets Owen and Gary to decorate it for him, so Roy is free to do as he likes. When Hayley returns home from hospital, she reveals to Anna that she does not like the wallpaper, but will pretend to for Roy's sake. Later that evening, Roy bumps into Anna on the street and tells her that he has told Hayley that he is fine with her suicide wish. He reveals to Anna that he feels he has lied to Hayley and betrayed her, and Anna does her best to comfort him. Anna is weary when Faye brings her new friend Grace Piper (Ella-Grace Gregoire) home for tea. Grace seems lovely, and Anna falls her tactics when it is revealed that Grace is in fact a manipulative girl who uses Faye in her dangerous games. Grace and Faye cause havoc all over Coronation Street, but it isn't until the pair attack Simon Barlow (Alex Bain) that Anna loses her temper with Faye. After Simon's stepmother Leanne Tilsley (Jane Danson) has confronted Faye, Anna asks for the truth, but Faye keeps on telling her that she and Grace haven't done anything wrong. That night, Grace sends Faye a video of her attacking Simon, and it soon goes viral after she posts it onto the Internet. Mary, another victim of Grace and Faye's, sees the video first, and shows it to Simon's carer Tina. The video travels around the street, disgusting most of the residents. Simon is refusing to leave the house because he is so embarrassed that he was attacked by girls. Soon, Simon's headmaster, Brian, gets wind of what has happened to him and goes round to the Windass household, where he tells a terrified Faye that he will have to inform to police. A few days later, Anna and Owen accompany Faye to the police station and they see Grace with her mother, who clashes with Anna. When Faye is questioned, she tells the detective that Grace has been blackmailing her, saying that if she grasses her up, she will make sure that nobody at her school will like her. Anna is proud of Faye for her bravery. Into the New Year, Anna supports Roy as Hayley's health deteriorates. On 20 January 2014, Anna decides to close the caf√© early, after having a bad feeling about Hayley and Roy's situation all day. A few minutes later, Hayley's former boss Carla Connor (Alison King) arrives at the caf√© and Anna answers the door. Carla also admits that she has had a bad feeling about the situation over the past few days. Carla then demands to see Hayley, but Anna tries to persuade her against the idea, thinking that leaving the couple alone would be the better choice. After giving in, Anna enters the caf√© flat with Carla after using her spare set of keys, but to their shock, they find a deceased Hayley on the bed with Roy's arm around her. Anna sees the glass on Hayley's bedside cabinet and realizes that she had taken an overdose, and washes the glass up for them. Carla witnesses Anna washing the glass and also guesses that Hayley committed suicide. Anna then walks into The Rovers and reveals to the devastated regulars that Hayley has died. The following week, Hayley's childhood friend Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine) - who was the Croppers' foster child a few years before - learns the truth about Hayley's death and shouts at Roy, storming out of the caf√©. Anna then finds Fiz and explains that it was what Hayley wanted and that it was not assisted suicide. Following Hayley's funeral, Anna and the residents gradually cope with her passing. By the time Anna has managed to cope with Hayley's death, she finds herself caught up in Gary and Owen's business partnership with the latter's client: Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre). She initially suspects Phelan of being a conman when Owen learns that he has not put his share into his account to put forward their business project, but a subsequent call that Owen makes to the bank later confirms that Phelan has put his share onto the account. When Anna goes to apologize to Phelan over her reservations, he tries to flirt with her. This startles Anna, who confides in Izzy. With Phelan apparently growing interest in Anna, she decides to settle the score and invites him to her house on the following week to request that he stay away from her. However, Phelan accuses Anna of developing feelings from him and proceeds to force himself onto her - before she eventually throws him out of the house. When Phelan and his wife Valerie (Caroline Berry) arrange for another dinner meeting with the Windass and Armstrong families in the Bistro, Anna feigns illness and runs back to the house. Izzy returns to see how Anna is, where she tells her that Phelan tried to rape her. Izzy reluctantly informs Gary about this, and he plans to confront Phelan by offering him a lift back to the house. By the time Owen and the rest of the workmen have left the site, Gary confronts Phelan and warns him to stay away from his mother. This ends badly, however, as Phelan provokes Gary into punching him upon badmouthing Anna and they fight - which ends with Gary hitting Phelan across the head with a large plank of wood, knocking him unconscious. Though it appeared that Gary had killed Phelan in the brawl, Phelan survives and reveals to Gary and Owen that his attack was caught on CCTV. He blackmails them, saying if they do not do as he says, he will take the footage to the police. At work, Phelan forces Gary and Owen to do silly tasks - such as Gary being forced to dig a grave for a dead pigeon, and then taking out perfectly fitted windows. This eventually gets too much for Owen and Gary, particularly when Phelan decides to keep Owen's ¬£80,000 investment in retribution for Gary's failed attempt to retaliate against him. Anna soon learns about this when she observes Owen having a breakdown, and later finds Gary suffering a panic attack. Anna calls Valerie and tells her how Phelan tried to rape her; however, she takes no notice - prompting Anna to berate Valerie before throwing her out of the house. She later tries to speak to Phelan, and he gives Anna an indecent ultimatum: he will release Gary and Owen from the contract if Anna has sex with him. Anna initially refuses, but reluctantly complies after finding Gary having another panic attack; she meets up with Phelan at a hotel, where they proceed to have sex. Anna then furiously leaves after Phelan teases her. On the following day, Phelan retains his promise and has Owen sign the contracts that releases him and Gary from the project - before leaving the street without the family or Valerie knowing what he and Anna had done. Following her betrayal with Phelan, a regretful Anna cannot bring herself to be close or have sex with Owen - which devastates him. He confronts her, asking her whether she has fallen out of love with him or not. Anna replies with explaining that everything she has ever done is purely for their families, and that she still loves him. Owen later confides in Katy, and breaking down in her arms. The guilt begins to get too much for Anna, who confides in Roy and tells him she has done something terrible. He urges her to tell Owen, and she organises a quiet night in so she can tell him about her night with Phelan. However, Izzy enters in floods of tears - so she does not tell Owen. In the week where Tina is murdered, Anna finally tells Owen about how she slept with Phelan to save him and Gary from further torment. Owen is distraught, even when Anna tries to make him see that she only did it for their relationship. Owen tells Anna that nothing will ever be the same for their relationship again. Owen then leaves Weatherfield for a short time for work, so Anna decides to tell Izzy and Katy about her night with Phelan. Izzy understands why Anna did what she did, but Katy is less forgiving, and implies that Anna is a \\"whore\\". When Owen returns a few weeks later, Faye organises a meal for him and Anna - explaining that it is going to get them back together. When Owen does not show up, Faye is livid, and Anna decides it is time to tell her about her and Phelan. She later disposes of the idea, and tells Owen to act like they are still a couple for their family's sake. When Faye goes out with her friends and gets drunk, Anna is furious at Gary for giving her the money, and when things get heated between Owen and Gary, Owen punches him. Anna shouts at Owen for hitting Gary, and orders Gary and Izzy to go home, while she tends to a drunken Faye. Anna and Owen eventually manage to repair their relationship and become a proper couple, just as Gary and Izzy end their long-standing relationship. Anna and Owen are upset by Gary and Izzy's split, but are later faced with another dilemma when Owen receives letters from people who he has borrowed money from. The following week, bailiffs arrive at the Windass and Armstrong household and begin taking their belongings, leaving Anna and Faye traumatized. When the bailiffs leave with most of their things, Owen tells Anna, Gary and Faye that he will get them out of the mess he has got them into. In 2015, Anna becomes concerned for Faye and she worries that Faye's bullying may be becoming worse as Faye tells Anna that she is being mocked for her weight gain. Eventually, it is revealed to Anna and Owen that Faye recently found out she was pregnant and Anna is beside Faye as she gives birth to a baby girl. Rather than be mad at Faye for not telling her, Anna is determined to encourage Faye to be responsible for her daughter, even if it means her no longer being in school until she learns to take maternal responsibility of the baby. Anna invites the father and his family over to discuss the baby. The father is revealed to be a boy called Jackson Hodge (Rhys Cadman). As Jackson denies taking any responsibility for getting Faye pregnant and Jackson's mother makes cruel remarks about Faye, a fumed Anna kicks out the family. Anna's encouragement for Faye to be a mother towards baby Miley (as Faye has named her, after pop star Miley Cyrus) causes to Owen thinking that Anna was acting selfish and that she was making Faye keep the baby so she can be a grandmother, but after a meeting with a social worker, when Owen confronts Anna with his suspicions, Anna breaks down over his harsh words and tells him of how she only wanted Faye to be a good mother and that she didn't want her to regret giving Miley up. When their relationship doesn't work, Anna and Owen split up and Owen leaves Weatherfield with Katy to Portugal before he would proceed to embark on a new life himself in Aberdeen. At Miley's christening, Faye does a runner from the church. Tim follows her outside and Faye admits to Tim that she's not ready to be a mother yet and that she thinks her mother doesn't understand how she feels. When Jackson's parents, Josie and Greig, offer to have Miley come live with them, both Anna and Tim were against the idea. However, they soon discovered this is the only option to prevent baby Miley from being adopted, and in that same month and year, the Windasses say a tearful goodbye to Miley and Josie drives off with the baby. In August 2015, the Hodges left Weatherfield with the baby for a new life in Canada, pretending to be on vacation. When Anna and Tim discovered this over a phone call, they told an upset Faye, who had a talk with best male friend, Craig Tinker (Colson Smith). Faye decided that Miley was better off in Canada, but when Tim confronted her of being selfish, Faye told him that she made up her mind and that Miley is with people that love her. On New Year's Eve 2015, Anna begins a relationship with Sally's ex-husband Kevin Webster (Michael Le Vell) They kept their relationship a secret but when Tim spotted them in a taxi, he decided to keep it secret as he didn't want to hurt Sally after she had a kiss with Kevin on the previous year before her wedding. In January 2016, Sally questions Anna's relationship with Kevin - particularly when they join and Tim in stopping a councillor from removing the graffiti poster that Craig created in memory of Maddie Heath (Amy James-Kelly), the late girlfriend of Kevin and Sally's daughter Sophie (Brooke Vincent). However, Sally gradually accepts Anna's relationship with Kevin after they convince her of their good intentions. Later on that night, she witnesses Kevin jumping in to save a man's life after nearly getting struck by Jamie Bowman (James Atherton) - a pornographic offender who had just robbed the Bistro and left Carla brutally unconscious. Anna was relieved when she rushed over to Kevin, glad that he was unharmed, but was surprised to see that the man whom he saved was Phelan - who himself had returned to the streets. After informing Izzy of his return, Anna was started when Phelan visited her and promised that she wouldn't cause him any trouble as long as he didn't either. Anna initially copes with Phelan's presence around the street, but is left furious when Phelan tells her that he will be staying in Weatherifeld after Kevin hired him to work at his garage. She later smashes his car with a metal pole and proceeds to physically attack him. Kevin, disgusted with Anna's behaviour, breaks up with her over her actions. The following day, Phelan arrives at the caf√© when it is closed and attacks Anna - pinning her up against the wall. However, Kevin walks in and kicks Phelan out of the cafe. Anna later confines to him about what Phelan did to her, and Kevin promises to support her no matter what happens. When Anna learns that Phelan is spending quality time with her longtime neighbour Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver), she attempts to warn her about his nature by explaining how he blackmailed her into having sex with him; however, as Phelan had already manipulated Eileen into believing his version of the story between him and Anna, she refuses to believe her story and throws her out of the house. Anna leaves, and once again clashes with Phelan when he tells her that he'll be sticking around for as long as he pleases. In October 2016, Anna and Kevin eventually agree to move in together, although she is disapproving of Gary's potential romance with David's brother Sarah (Tina O'Brien). Anna is present when a car accident on the street caused by David traps Gary and David's own daughter, Lily Platt. The locals gather together and manage to lift the vehicle in order to free Gary and Lily, but moments later the car explodes, causing Anna to fall in a puddle of petrol. A second explosion then rips through the street, and due to her being covered in petrol, Anna is set on fire. Kevin attempts to put the fire out with help from David and Sarah's brother Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), and she is rushed to hospital - where Gary and Kevin are told that Anna's burns are severe, with her clothes melting into her skin. After the fire, Anna is left unable to walk unaided. She decides to end her relationship with Kevin, feeling that it is unfair to burden herself onto him. However, after persuasion from her family and friends, she reunites with Kevin. In the course of recovering, Anna becomes friends with Eileen's ex-boyfriend Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis) upon learning of their mutual disliking of Phelan; earlier on in March 2016, Phelan stole Eileen from Michael after destroying their relationship. In November 2016, Anna and Michael learn that Phelan and his business partner Vinny Ashford (Ian Kelsey) have been defrauding Sarah and the other residents in the course of their \\"Calcutta Street\\" flats scam development, They hatch a plot to bring Phelan down and expose his scam; while Michael breaks into the yard to obtain evidence against him, Anna invites Phelan to stall for time and bribe him in leaving Weatherfield - stating just how much she resents him for what he did to her family and also realizing that he is in fact manipulating Eileen amid their relationship. When Phelan rejects Anna's attempt to bribe him in leaving Weatherfield, his phone rings and he discovers her conspiracy with Michael as a result. After smashing Anna's house out of anger whilst promising to make her \\"regret crossing him\\", Phelan would go on to confront Michael - resulting in a showdown between them that ends with Michael having a heart attack, and he dies with Phelan watching as he refuses to aid him. Anna becomes guilty for Michael's death and tries desperately to expose Phelan for his role within the manslaughter, but is left unsuccessful after Phelan convinces the street of his innocence when they learn the truth about his scam; Vinny had fled the street with their money, prompting Phelan to implicate him as the sole fraudster behind the scam whilst covering up his involvement against Anna's claims. At the end of December 2016, Anna's landlord and Simon's father Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) returns to Weatherfield and decides he wants to move back into his old flat, leaving Anna homeless until Kevin suggests that she and Faye move in with him and his son, Jack. On New Year's Eve, while Kevin is at work, a powercut frightens Jack, which results in Anna falling down the stairs as she rushes to be with him. Jack leaves the house to find Kevin, however he finds Phelan who helps Anna after she regains consciousness. When Anna found out that Faye was dating Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni), a juvenile delinquent, she was furious - recounting how her last boyfriend got her pregnant. This caused a rift between Anna and Faye, particularly as her relationship with Seb also led to her forming a friendship with Phelan - who recently hired Seb to work for him. Faye proved her love for Seb by getting a tattoo, which soon got infected. Whilst they were at the hospital, Faye bumped into Jackson and their daughter Miley. This delighted Anna and Tim, but Seb becomes jealous and punches Jackson under the threat that both he and Miley stay away from Faye. This led to Seb getting arrested and land in a young offenders' institution. Faye, however, still loves Seb and asked Phelan if he can take her to see him. Anna eventually found out and angrily ordered Faye to stay away from them, which resulted in Faye running away from her and staying with Gary and Izzy. Eventually, they forgave each other. Soon, Anna gets herself involved in Seb's family - as she found out that Seb is looking after his twin siblings Charlie and Lexi, as their mother, Abi (Sally Carman), is a heroin addict. After Abi took a heroin overdose, an ambulance was contacted and social services got involved and took the kids away. An angry and devastated Seb angrily accuses Anna of calling social services. After confining to Phelan about the situation, Seb insults Anna so she slaps him. Anna confronts Phelan about the altercation and lashes out when he mocks Owen over the recent loss of his daughter: Kate. However, she is overpowered and leaves - telling Phelan that he can \\"go to hell\\", to which he responds by telling Anna \\"after you\\". Not realizing that she left her earing behind at Phelan's yard, Anna witnesses Seb falling off a ladder whilst cleaning the solicitors' windows and she quickly called an ambulance. At the hospital, she meets Seb's case worker: Nicola Rubinstein (Nicola Thorp), who she recently found out was Phelan's long-lost daughter. After a friendly conversation about Seb and their own personal problems, Anna confides in Nicola about Phelan by describing the events of her ordeal with him. The next day, Nicola would discover that Phelan had previously raped her mother Annabel - causing her to realize that Anna was telling the truth about her dad; she subsequently disowned Phelan afterwards. When Phelan learns that Anna turned Nicola against him, he vows revenge and plans to implicate her as the culprit who caused Seb's ladder accident. He tells Seb that Anna pushed him off the ladder after planting an earring by the solicitors door. Seb then told Faye, who called the police. She was arrested and was questioned by the police, strongly insisting that Phelan is setting her up. She was released pending further investigation and was angered to find out that very few people on the street believed her. She was furious when she found that Nicola was pregnant with Gary's baby. Afterwards, she attempted to trick Phelan into confessing on her mobile phone as to why he is framing her, however Phelan does not fall for it and pretended he didn't know what she was talking about. He then told Seb that he saw Anna push him, which led to Anna being arrested for the second time. This time, she was refused bail. Tim and Sarah found out that Gary died in an explosion whilst working for the Ukraine. Anna was devastated and started to have a mental breakdown in her cell, leading to the prison taking her to see a doctor. However, she was relieved when she found out that Gary was alive all along. During Gary's next visit, Anna was overdosed after she took medication prescribed by her doctor and she collapsed while trying to get back into her cell. She was taken to hospital, where Kevin finished with her after he couldn't take any more of her obsession with Phelan. Whilst the doctor and her prison guard was not looking, Anna makes her escape. Phelan called the police after finding out that Anna was at the Red Rec, with undercover police searching for her. Anna finds this out after Craig talked to a copper and so she escapes to Roy's caf√©. The next morning, Anna broke into Phelan's office to try and find evidence that Phelan is lying. However, she heard footsteps and using a wrench, she hit Eileen unconscious by mistake, when she thought it was Phelan. Realizing that she could be caught, Anna plans her escape from the country with Faye. She then went back to see Eileen, but Phelan caught her out and called the ambulance and police. Anna and Faye escape to a car park, but was surrounded by the police, who ask her to come out of the vehicle. Realizing that she is now caught, she encouraged Faye to get out of the car, which she does. Anna was taken into custody once more. Phelan visits Anna again and threatens her family. A furious Anna slaps him in front of the guards and prisoners. In January 2018, on the eve of her trial starting, Anna receives a visit from Eileen when she plans to question her about Phelan without his knowledge. Anna deduces that Phelan in unaware of Eileen visiting her and tries again to explain his nature by repeating her accusations; that Phelan killed Michael and bullied/conned the Weatherfield community. Eileen disbelieves Anna, even when she points out how the community merely believed Phelan's story that he was a victim in the scam ordeal and that Vinny was the sole fraudster who conned them. When Eileen lets slip that Seb has accused Phelan of murder, Anna believes that Phelan killed Vinny - which unbeknownst to her is true - and shouts out that he is a murderer, but is forced back into her cell and Eileen leaves unconvinced. When Gary and Tim visit her later on, Anna is shocked to learn that the victim whom Seb has accused Phelan of murdering was in fact their friend Luke Britton (Dean Fagan). She insists that they find Seb so he can testify against Phelan to stop him from inflicting more harm against the community. Anna's trial soon begins and Phelan sticks to his story that Anna pushed Seb off the ladder. Seb, however, tells the truth in court and states that Phelan pressured to say it to the police - angering Phelan. This gave the Windasses hope that Anna would be found not guilty. However, Eileen found CCTV footage of Gary and Tim dragging Seb into a car - making it look like they are kidnapping him and forcing him to change his story. As a result of this, Seb's testimony is destroyed and Anna's case looks doomed even when both Roy and Tim separately protest of her innocence. Anna then makes a last-ditch effort to describe Phelan as the \\"monster\\" he is by recalling how he forced her into sleeping with him, as well as explaining what he did to Owen and Michael respectively. Unfortunately, she is silenced and Anna is later found guilty of GBH. Anna screams to the court that she is innocent and Phelan is evil, but is taken away to her cells - apologizing to a heartbroken Faye whilst Phelan taunts her for apparently one final time. Anna is later wrongfully sentenced to five years in prison off-screen. In March 2018, Eileen learns that Anna was telling the truth about Phelan's involvement in the \\"Calcutta Street\\" flats scam ordeal; Tim had arranged a meet-up with Phelan to expose what he did to Anna, and ended up recording him confess to orchestrating the scam. Two weeks later, the truth about Phelan is finally revealed when Gary and Seb infiltrate his worksite with the intent of locating the gun he used to kill Luke - only to unknowingly expose the corpses of Vinny, thus proving Anna's statement correct despite the fact that she never knew that Phelan killed Vinny, and that of Michael's surrogate son: Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth). Back in 2017 during Anna's ordeal with Phelan, she and the rest of the street were left unaware that Phelan had locked Andy in a cellar for nearly a year ever since he married Eileen - at the time of which Andy had tried unsuccessfully to bring Phelan to justice after learning the truth about Michael and \\"Calcutta Street\\". On the day Anna had told Nicola the truth about her father, Phelan forced Andy to kill Vinny before executing Andy himself - after which he buried their corpses prior to framing Anna for Seb's ladder accident. When Tim informed Eileen about this, she confronts Phelan and he confesses to his crimes - which causes Eileen to realize that Anna was telling the truth about Phelan all along. While Phelan confirms Anna's theory that he killed Michael and that Seb was telling the truth about Luke as well, Eileen realizes that her husband had in fact raped Anna before going on to frame her for pushing Seb off a ladder - both of which Phelan refuses to admit committing. Their confrontation ends with Eileen kicking Phelan into the sea, seemingly killing him, and the street later discovers in April 2018 the extent of his crimes - thus proving that Anna was right about Phelan from the start. In May 2018, a month after Ken's son Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard) had launched a public campaign for Anna to be released from prison, she returns to Weatherfield when Gary informs her that Phelan had in fact survived the fall. Gary had since then planned to abduct Phelan and keep him captive for him and Anna to get revenge on for what he did towards them, but this fails when Sarah learns what Gary did and their argument over informing the police about Phelan's return allows Phelan to escape. He then retrieves his gun, locks Gary and Sarah in the builder's yard, and goes on a rampage around the street. Anna then appears for the first time in four months when she frees Gary and Sarah from Phelan's captivity, and the trio rush over to Eileen's house following a gunshot. They find that Phelan knocked down both Eileen and Seb in a failed attempt to take his grandson Zac, shot Nicola in the ensuing struggle, and is currently holding the bistro hostage in a bid to seek medical treatment for his daughter. While Gary embraces over Zac and Sarah attends to Eileen and Seb for the awaiting arrival of emergency services, Anna peruses Phelan and enters the bistro through the back entrance. They come face-to-face when Anna sees Phelan taking Carla's sister-in-law Michelle (Kym Marsh), who was due to marry the restaurant's owner Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) moments ago, hostage in the kitchen. With Phelan distracted at facing Anna once more, Michelle seizes an opportunity to free herself from him - prompting Phelan to throw her aside and shoot Michelle in response. This prompts Anna to charge at Phelan with a knife and she stabs him in the chest just as he turns to shoot her, fatally wounding Phelan as he slumps onto the floor in pain. In the moment Carla and Robert rush to Michelle's aid and her son Ali Neeson (James Burrows) begins to give her medical treatment, Phelan makes a last-ditch attempt to get one over Anna by implicating her in his \\"murder\\". He pulls the knife from his chest and boasts how she will be imprisoned for his murder, but Michelle defends Anna by telling Phelan how she would describe the attack as self-defence - even though Anna replies that she doesn't have to do that. However, when Phelan points out that Michelle would risk imprisonment as a result, she states that she would take the risk regardless in retaliation for what he did to Andy and Luke. As Phelan reels over his ultimate loss, Anna walks up to him and taunts how people like him don't get to win in the end - before she then promises that Zac will never know of his existence once she acquaints herself with him. Anna then tells Phelan that she won the feud, and watches as Phelan takes his last breath and dies in front of her - finally ending his reign of terror at long last. Shortly after Phelan's death, Anna reunites with her children and Kevin before later informing Eileen that he is dead. Eileen apologizes to Anna for disbelieving her, and they make amends in order to move on from Phelan. Just moments before watching Phelan's lifeless body being taken away in a private ambulance, Anna explains that she is leaving Weatherfield to start a new life in Durham and invites Faye to live with her; Faye accepts and leaves with Anna for a new life away from Weatherfield, but later returns to live with Tim - albeit confirms that Anna is doing well following her ordeal in Weatherfield. ==Creation== The character of Anna was created as part of a new family unit that new producer Kim Crowther was introducing to the soap opera, consisting of a mother, father, son and uncle. They were originally billed as a storyline device for established character David Platt. An ITV spokesperson said of the character and her onscreen family: \\"The Windass family are very rough and ready, always ducking and diving. Early on they get involved with David Platt when he helps to fit a new kitchen in the Windass family home. However, Anna thinks the work is shoddy and refuses to pay for it. David goes round, rips out the kitchen and sets fire to it outside the family‚Äôs house.\\" Rush said of their entrance and choice of surname for the family: \\"The Windasses are a very close family, who are just about on the wrong side of the law, but they mean well. And yes, I am prepared for some of the things people might shout at me in the street because of the name!\\" The character was originally called Donna Windass but was changed last minute to Anna Windass after a series of name changes to all the members of the family since their inception, but before appearing onscreen. Auditions were held for the part of Anna, with actress Debbie Rush going on to get the part over a number of highly-rated actors. Of this Rush said: \\"I went for the casting a few months ago and then was called back for the screen test. When I got the part I couldn‚Äôt believe it, I was thrilled to bits. I watched Corrie all the time growing up and all the family are tuning in now that I‚Äôm going to be in it. It‚Äôs surreal, because the cast and characters are already part of your life just from watching it.\\" ==Development== The character of Anna has been seen to differ from the rest of her family in terms of personality traits that are not present in the others. This is because she does not approve of the continuous line of scams her husband pulls, as well as the life of crime Len and Gary indulge in. Anna is often described as the only nice Windass. === Departure and return === On 3 July 2017, it was announced that Rush had opted to leave the serial to pursue other roles, following nine years in the role. The actress will finish filming in late 2017, with Anna departing in January 2018. Rush explained that the decision to leave was \\"not made lightly\\", but she is looking forward to pursuing other roles. She added, \\"I love playing Anna and will miss working with the fantastic cast and crew.\\" Kate Oates, the show's series producer, promised that writers are creating an \\"exciting\\" departure plot for Anna, which sees her \\"fighting for her family and tackling old enemies head-on.\\" Oates commented, \\"It's always sad when a huge talent like Debbie Rush decides to move to pastures new.\\" Additionally, a show spokesperson confirmed \\"plenty more drama\\" for the character before her departure and wished Rush \\"every success for the future\\". Rush's exit aired on 22 January 2018. On 31 May 2018, Anna returned to the series as part of Phelan's exiting storyline. Her return had not been announced beforehand and was a surprise for the audience. She appeared in the episodes first broadcast on 31 May and 1 June 2018. Rush was glad that Anna's story did not end with her last departure as she felt they could not leave Anna imprisoned. On her reasons for leaving, Rush explained, \\"I didn't leave because I hated it, I left for a few different reasons and I loved going back.\\" Rush had already agreed to reprise her role for the episodes when she left and had to decline other acting opportunities for the return. The actress liked returning for the episodes. After her departure, she continued to tweet about the show, which attracted the attention of her followers. Rush filmed her scenes over five days and when she entered the studios in her car, she had to hide so nobody saw her. In her final episodes, Anna kills Phelan after he shoots Nicola and Michelle and holds several residents hostage in the Bistro. Rush explained that Anna realises that Phelan is \\"pure evil\\" so decides to kill him before he kills her. She added, \\"I think in a moment of pure, frenzied anger and vengeance, she just picked the kitchen knife up and stabbed him. Then she was thrilled that she'd done it, because she could finally sleep.\\" Rush hoped the audience would enjoy the storyline and believed that Anna's story had firmly ended. ==Reception== For her portrayal of Anna, Rush was nominated for Best Actress at The British Soap Awards 2015. Anna's return was nominated for Biggest OMG Soap moment at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards; it came in second place with 16.2% of the total votes. Kris Green of media website Digital Spy commented that Anna and the Windass family had \\"settled in so well, in such a short space of time\\". Actor Mikey North attributed their success as characters to a combination of good writing and prominent plotlines received in a relatively short time period. Grace Dent of The Guardian has said that she likes the character of Anna, pointing out her redeeming personality traits: \\"Chief apologist for all of these people is Anna Windass, Eddie's wife and Gary's mum, who is so surprisingly sweet and non-abrasive that she manages to keep her entire clan on the right side of likable just through hapless handwringing alone.\\" She went on to say \\"I rather like Anna, although Gail Platt isn't a fan. I was expecting another Cilla Battersby-Brown, but instead she's more Emily Bishop in a sea-green velour fake Juicy Couture and Asda slippers. Anna knows that, children-wise, her and Gail have lots in common and they'd work better as a team than at war.\\" Tony Stewart of The Mirror also describes Anna's character as a scrounger. MSN branded Anna and her family as chavs and suggested they would make the perfect guests for The Jeremy Kyle Show. Simon Swift of Soaplife magazine stated that at first, he couldn't help feeling that Anna and her clan are a bit too much like original neighbours-from-hell the Battersbys. In 2009 Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture, who runs a monthly feature of the most popular and unpopular soap opera characters, profiled the Windasses, adding that Anna is the main reason to why they were initially unpopular, stating: \\"The Windass family's introduction has not gone down too well, and Donna (sic) seems to be the prime target for the vitriol against them. Perhaps they can be redeemed a la the Jacksons in EE or the Timminses in Neighbours, or perhaps they'll just leave‚Ä¶\\" Kate White from Inside Soap said that Anna and Owen were a \\"great match\\". She could not understand why Anna could not just forgive Owen because she had with all of Eddie's crimes. ==References *Anna Windass at itv.com Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2008 Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional sexual assault victims Category:Fictional characters with disfigurements Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional prisoners and detainees Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Burn survivors in fiction Category:Fictional people from Manchester ","title":"Anna Windass"},{"id":"20171551","text":"Donald \\"XL\\" Robertson is a hip-hop Recording artist & producer and entrepreneur born and raised in New Orleans. ==Background== Donald XL Robertson was exposed to soul, Funk & Jazz music at a very young age raised in The Big Easy a city known for its rich jazz and Bounce music heritage.

Moor was involved, under the supervision of his cousin, Christopher Middleton, with voyages to the bay from about 1730 to 1741 and carried out increasingly important duties during that period. In 1741 he and Middleton left the HBC's employ and Moor was given command of to aid his cousin in in a search for the Northwest Passage. They overwintered at Prince of Wales Fort where sickness plagued the crews. Their survey of the shoreline and tides of the west side of Hudson Bay was not particularly successful. Moor and Middleton and the 1741‚Äì1742 expedition were under the scrutiny of Arthur Dobbs, an opponent of the HBC monopoly of the bay area. Middleton was accused of protecting the HBC monopoly and Moor took the side of Dobbs. In 1746, Moor was in command of a private discovery expedition to Hudson Bay funded by Dobbs and others. After a short and unsuccessful period of exploration by the two ships, they decided to overwinter at the HBC post at York Factory. The next summer some good exploration was carried out on the western shore and discovered Chesterfield Inlet but did not fully explore it. He also examined Rankin Inlet and Wager Bay. At a point, after further exploration, illness and threats of mutiny turned the expedition for home. Moor's competence as a commander was called into question on his return. There is little doubt that his weakness and uncertainty affected the expedition but the unhappiness of the investors was also because he refused to engage in illegal trade on their behalf. Moor appears to have retired around this time. His explorations did add significantly to the knowledge of the area despite his problems with the command of the expedition. {     } ==References== Category:1765 deaths Category:British explorers of North America Category:Explorers of Canada Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"William Moor"},{"id":"20171577","text":"Wan Man is a small island (pulau) in the state of Terengganu, Malaysia.

However, the Lockerbie case demonstrated that the requirement to extradite or prosecute is not a rule of customary international law. The obligation arises regardless of the extraterritorial nature of the crime and regardless of the fact that the perpetrator and victim may be of alien nationality.Hall, Stephen, International Law (2006) 2nd ed., Butterworths Tutorial Series, LexisNexis Butterworths It is generally included as part of international treaties dealing with an array of transnational crimes to facilitate bringing perpetrators to justice. ==Rationale== The rationale for this principle is to ensure that there are no jurisdictional gaps in the prosecution of internationally committed crimes. It is, however, unusual for states to be required to exercise this jurisdiction because often another state party will have an interest in the matter, and so will apply for extradition of the defendant(s).

The leopard complex is a group of genetically related coat patterns in horses. These patterns range from progressive increases in interspersed white hair similar to graying or roan to distinctive, Dalmatian-like leopard spots on a white coat. Secondary characteristics associated with the leopard complex include a white sclera around the eye, striped hooves and mottled skin. The leopard complex gene is also linked to abnormalities in the eyes and vision. These patterns are most closely identified with the Appaloosa and Knabstrupper breeds, though its presence in breeds from Asia to western Europe has indicated that it is due to a very ancient mutation. ==Leopard complex patterns== Coat patterns in the leopard complex range from being hardly distinguishable from an unaffected coat, to nearly pure white. Unlike most other spotting patterns, the spotting and especially the white regions associated with the leopard complex tend to be symmetrical and originate over the hips. Furthermore, a certain amount of this inherited white patterning is present at birth. The amount of white, even if none is present at birth, often grows throughout the horse's life by gradual \\"roaning\\" which is not related to graying or true roan. Colored spots reflect the underlying coat color, be it black, chestnut, gray, or silver dun-buckskin. A number of factors, each separately, genetically controlled, interact to produce familiar patterns such as \\"snowflake,\\" \\"leopard,\\" and \\"fewspot\\". ===Leopard spotting=== A single, incomplete dominant gene (Lp) controls the presence of leopard-spotting in horses. A dominant gene requires only a single copy to produce an affected phenotype; an incomplete dominant gene produces a different result depending on whether one or two copies are present. A horse's genotype may be lp/lp (homozygous recessive), Lp/lp (heterozygous), or Lp/Lp (homozygous dominant). Horses without a dominant Lp gene do not exhibit leopard-complex traits, and cannot produce offspring with the Lp gene unless it is contributed by the other parent. Such horses are termed \\"non-characteristic\\" among Appaloosa horse aficionados. Horses with at least one Lp gene possess, at the very least, leopard-complex \\"characteristics\\": * skin that is mottled, speckled or blotchy around the muzzle, eyes, genitals, and anus; the remainder of the body may be primarily pigmented (gray or black in the absence of other genes), primarily unpigmented (pink or flesh-colored), or mottled, * striped hooves, * white sclera. The presence of regions of alternating pigmented and unpigmented skin may not definitively suggest the leopard gene. They may not be visible due to the effects of other genes. For example, extensive white markings on the face may mask the presence of mottling around the eyes and muzzle, and white markings on the legs often end in white hooves. Furthermore, other genes may produce similar conditions: white sclera are associated with broad white face markings, striped hooves with the Silver dapple gene, and freckled skin with the Champagne gene. A DNA test can now identify the Lp gene, though a combination of pedigree knowledge and coat characteristics also help. While both heterozygous and homozygous Lp horses possess the aforementioned characteristics, heterozygotes and homozygotes differ significantly in the presence of true spots. True leopard spots are produced only by the Lp gene, and directly reflect the underlying coat color (bay, black, gray, cremello, red dun, and so on). Since these spots match the coat color, they are not visible unless the surrounding pigment is removed. As a rule, heterozygous leopards have larger, more abundant spots, while homozygotes have smaller, scarcer spots. ===White patterning=== The extent of this horse's white patterning is illustrated because he is wet. Only large regions of pigmented (gray or black) skin will yield chestnut-colored hairs. There is at least one genetically controlled type of white patterning that is strictly associated with the leopard complex. These white patterns permit the spots associated with the leopard complex to become visible. Other white patterns, such as tobiano or white leg markings, obscure leopard spots. A certain amount of leopard-associated white patterning may be present at birth. Temporal changes in the amount of white patterning are discussed below. Leopard-associated white patterning is usually symmetrical and originates over the hips. A proposed gene, PATN-1, may be responsible for the most familiar expressions of white: heterozygotes possessing common-size \\"blankets\\" and homozygotes possessing extensive \\"blankets\\" that may affect the entire coat. Even horses with extensive white usually retain dark colored regions just above the hooves, on the knees and hocks, stifles and elbows, hips and points of shoulder, the tail, mane, and the bony parts of the face. The smallest amount of white patterning is just a sprinkling of white over the hips. ===Leopard- associated roaning=== This horse likely began life completely black, and has since undergone extensive varnish roaning. Just as there is white patterning specifically associated with the leopard complex, there is a type of progressive roaning that is unrelated to graying out or true roan. Horses with coat patterns within the leopard complex are known for their mystifying coat changes. This unusual characteristic is due at least in part to leopard roaning, also called \\"varnish roaning.\\" While the gray gene only affects the hair, some horses with the Lp gene will progressively lose pigment in both the skin and hair as they age. Also unlike graying out, the leopard spots are not affected by this roaning process. Neither are the \\"bony prominences\\" strongly affected. As a varnish roan horse lightens, the leopard spots indistinguishable from the rest of the coat become visible. Some horses without any dense white patterning at birth seem to spontaneously develop into white, leopard-spotted horses with maturity. Varnishing is more common among Appaloosa horses, and less common among Norikers and Knabstruppers, whose breed associations find it undesirable. ==Interactions and terminology== Like much of coat color genetics, commonly used terms do not necessarily correspond to precise genetic states. Nevertheless, terminology can reveal a lot about the genetic interactions surrounding the leopard complex. The reddish leopard- spots in this otherwise bay coat are only visible after leopard-related roaning has occurred, as here. * Heterozygous Lp/lp horses with extensive white patterning at birth are white with large, self-colored spots. They are termed \\"leopard\\" if fully white, \\"near-leopard\\" if not. By the action of varnish roan, a near-leopard may in time become nearly indistinguishable from a full leopard. * Heterozygous Lp/lp horses with less white patterning are described by the size of their \\"blanket\\" and the presence of spots: spotted blanket over loin and hips, for example. Again, these horses may varnish with age. * Homozygous Lp/Lp horses with extensive white patterning at birth are white with tiny, sparse spots or none at all. In most languages, such foals are called \\"white-born\\" but the term familiar to most English speakers is \\"fewspot (leopard).\\" * Homozygous Lp/Lp horses with less than extensive white patterning at birth possess dense white blankets and are called \\"snowcap.\\" * Heterozygous Lp/lp and homozygous Lp/Lp horses with only a tiny amount of white patterning may not possess enough white to reveal large or small spots. A sprinkling of white patterning over the hips is called a \\"snowflake\\" pattern. Such tiny blankets may varnish and grow. * Heterozygous Lp/lp horses and homozygous Lp/Lp horses, in the absence of dense white patterning, appear much the same. That is, unless they begin to varnish. As the coat becomes more and more white, spots may become visible. A homozygous Lp/Lp horse, with only tiny spots, may simply develop this unique roaning pattern and is called \\"frosted\\" or \\"marble.\\" A heterozygote may eventually show conspicuous leopard spots. ==Patterns== Base colors are overlain by various spotting patterns, which are variable and often do not fit neatly into a specific category. These patterns are described as follows: {class=\\"sortable \\" - bgcolor=\\"#ececec\\" PatternDescriptionImageBased on images from Sponenberg 2003, 153-156 - Blanket or snowcap  A solid white area normally covering, but not limited to, the hip area, with a contrasting base color.Sponenberg 2003, p. 90100px - SpotsGeneric term for a horse which has white or dark spots over all or a portion of its body.Identifying the Appaloosa Horse100px - Blanket with spots a white blanket which has dark spots within the white.

The dark points over bony areas are called \\"varnish marks\\" and distinguish this pattern from a traditional roan.100px - MottledA fewspot leopard that is completely white with only mottled skin showing.100px - Roan Blanket or FrostHorses with roaning over the croup and hips.

This gene was termed Lp for \\"leopard complex\\" by Dr. D. Phillip Sponenberg in 1982, and was described as an autosomal, incomplete dominant gene. Horses without the gene (lplp) were solid-colored, those with two copies of the gene (homozygous or LpLp) were usually \\"fewspots\\", while those with a single copy of the gene (heterozygous or Lplp) ranged from mere mottled skin to full leopard. In 2004, Lp was assigned to equine chromosome 1 (ECA1) by a team of researchers. Four years later, this team mapped the Lp gene to a transient receptor potential channel gene, TRPM1 or Melastatin 1 (MLSN1). In 2011, a study identified the Lp allele in DNA samples collected from prehistoric horses. This finding represents evidence for the presence of leopard complex spotting in prehistoric wild horse populations. The ancient origin of the allele may explain the presence of spotted horse paintings in paleolithic cave art. It is thought that during the ice age the leopard pattern may have been helpful as camouflage against the snowy environment. ==Vision issues== Congenital stationary night blindness is an ophthalmologic disorder in horses which is present at birth (congenital), non-progressive (stationary) and affects the animal's vision in conditions of low lighting. Horses with CSNB may be hesitant to enter dimly- lit places - such as indoor arenas, dark stalls, or trailers - and be apprehensive when in such conditions, which may interfere with handling or riding. CSNB is usually diagnosed based on the owner's observations, but some horses have visibly abnormal eyes: poorly aligned eyes (dorsomedial strabismus) or involuntary eye movement (nystagmus). The condition can be confirmed using electroretinography, from which a \\"negative ERG\\" indicates CSNB. While the retina is a normal shape, the nerve signal triggered when light reaches rod cells does not reach the brain. Rod cells in the retina are connected to bipolar cells, which transmit the nerve impulse to the next set of neurons. It is thought that these cells fail to undergo the basic chemical reaction for nerve impulse transmission, which involves shuttling of calcium (Ca2+). Congenital stationary night blindness has been linked with the leopard complex since the 1970s.Witzel CA, Joyce JR, Smith EL. Electroretinography of congenital night blindness in an Appaloosa filly. Journal of Equine Medicine and Surgery 1977; 1: 226‚Äì229. The presence of CSNB in non-leopard breeds and horses suggested that the two conditions might be located on close, but separate genes. However, one study used ERG findings to diagnose all the homozygous Lp subjects with CSNB, while all heterozygotes and non-Lp horses were free from the disorder. The gene to which Lp has now been localized encodes a protein that channels calcium ions, a key factor in the transmission of nerve impulses. This protein, which is found in the retina and the skin, existed in fractional percentages of the normal levels in homozygous Lp/Lp horses. A 2008 study theorizes that both CSNB and leopard complex spotting patterns are linked to the TRPM1 gene. Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) is also present in the breed. Appaloosas have an eightfold greater risk of developing Equine Recurrent Uveitis (ERU) than all other breeds combined. Up to 25% of all horses with ERU may be Appaloosas. Uveitis in horses has many causes, including eye trauma, disease, and bacterial, parasitic and viral infections, but ERU is characterized by recurring episodes of uveitis, rather than a single incident. If not treated, ERU can lead to blindness, which occurs more often in Appaloosas than in other breeds. Up to 80% of all uveitis cases are found in Appaloosas, with physical characteristics including light colored coat patterns, little pigment around the eyelids and sparse hair in the mane and tail denoting more at-risk individuals. Researchers may have identified a gene region containing an allele that makes the breed more susceptible to the disease. ==Prevalence== The Appaloosa horse is the breed best known for the leopard complex patterns, though the complex also characterizes the Knabstrupper, as well as breeds related to the Appaloosa such as the Pony of the Americas and Colorado Ranger. The gene is also relatively common in the Falabella, the Noriker and the related South German Coldblood. The existence of leopard-spotted coats among Asian breeds such as the Karabair and Mongolian Altai has been recorded since ancient times, and suggests that the gene is very old. Leopard complex patterns may exist in low frequencies among some other breeds, depending on whether horses with leopard complex genetics existed in the foundation bloodstock for a given breed. ===In cave art=== The approximately 25,000-year-old paintings \\"Dappled Horses of Pech Merle\\" in a cave in France depict spotted horses with a leopard pattern. Archaeologists had debated over whether the artists were painting what they saw or whether the spotted horses had some symbolic meaning. However, a 2011 study of the DNA of ancient horses found that leopard complex was present, and therefore the cave painters most likely did see real spotted horses. ==References== Category:Horse coat colors ","title":"Leopard complex"},{"id":"20171601","text":"Gary Windass is a fictional character from the British soap opera Coronation Street, portrayed by Mikey North. The character made his first appearance on 14 November 2008, the same episode where his parents Eddie (Steve Huison) and Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) were introduced on the show as well. Since then, Gary has been involved in relationships with Izzy Armstrong (Cherylee Houston), Alya Nazir (Sair Khan) and Sarah Platt (Tina O'Brien). The character has also embarked on a feud with Sarah's brother David Platt (Jack P Shephard), along with Izzy's father Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) and Anna's rapist Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre) ‚Äî the latter of whom he becomes archenemies with from 2014 to 2018. During his time on the show, Gary's storylines have included his conflict with PTSD after joining the army, forming a business partnership with Owen, bonding with parents' adopted daughter Faye (Ellie Leach), a brief custody battle against ex-girlfriend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) after she becomes surrogate and gives birth to Gary and Izzy's son, Jake, a close friendship with Faye's biological father Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine), helping Sarah's daughter Bethany (Lucy Fallon) overcome her troubles with bullying in school and being subjugated to child grooming and sexual exploitation by her pimp boyfriend Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper), a one-night stand with Phelan's daughter Nicola Rubinstein (Nicola Thorp), which results in her giving birth to their son Zack and appointing Faye's boyfriend Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) to become his apprentice. In 2019, Gary becomes the show's main antagonist when he is revealed to be the culprit who caused the death of Alya's sister-in-law, Rana Habeeb (Bhavna Limbachia) upon sabotaging the Underworld Factory roof ‚Äî in his attempt to sort out his debts to loan shark Rick Neelan (Greg Wood), leading to the collapse of the factory roof and Rana being killed from the incident as a result. The character later killed Rick in self-defense when the latter tried to murder him in the woods, subsequently taking over his criminal empire as a result. Soon afterwards, Gary proceeded to establish a relationship with David's colleague Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon), clash with Rana's brother Imran (Charlie de Melo) over the circumstances behind his sister's death, become enemies with Sarah's boyfriend Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson) after growing jealous of their newfound romance, develop a feud with Maria's love interest Ali Neeson (James Burrows), hospitalise Ali's brother Ryan (Ryan Prescott) after beating him up for unintentionally stealing his money and blackmail his own client Derek Milligan (Craige Els) into partaking with his scheme to invest the factory ‚Äî which ultimately sparked the events of Derek instigating a lethal Christmas siege that culminates with his own death, though not after accidentally killing Ali's stepfather Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) and shooting David's girlfriend Shona Ramsey (Julia Goulding) in the resulting impact. ==Storylines== Gary Windass first arrives in Weatherfield with his uncle, Len (Conor Ryan). Together, they steal tools that belonged to local builder Joe McIntyre (Reece Dinsdale). Shortly afterwards, Gary and Len steal and burn out a sports car that Joe's stepson David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) and his friend Graeme Proctor (Craig Gazey) had been driving. Gary is later furious when David smugly informs him that the car was already stolen. Gary and the rest of his family later move next door to the Platts' where their quarrel continues to heighten. On Christmas Eve 2008, he flirts with Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan) in The Rovers Return Inn. The pair then get drunk on Rosie's birthday champagne and end up in bed together that night much to the annoyance of Rosie's parents, Kevin (Michael Le Vell) and Sally (Sally Dynevor). The following day, Gary virtually ignores Rosie when he arrives at the Platts' Christmas dinner party. He then gets into a fist fight with David after telling him he has set his sights on his girlfriend - Joe's daughter Tina (Michelle Keegan). On New Year's Day 2009, Gary constantly pesters Tina, which results in Joe warning him off. In spite of the tension, Gary shares a relatively friendly relationship with Tina and enjoys winding David up by repeatedly bragging that Tina is soon going to be his girlfriend. After Gary nearly brawls with Joe, he talks Len into helping him steal expensive copper piping from Joe's workplace. Joe is initially the prime suspect, but David tells the police he had seen Gary and Len laughing and driving away the night of the theft. Gary is thrilled to learn that Tina believes he is innocent, as this drives a further wedge between her and David. In January 2009, Gary continually follows and taunts David following him down the street. During an altercation, Gary mentions several things from David's past, including him driving into the lake and pushing his mother Gail Platt (Helen Worth) down the stairs. Things escalate when David enters his house, having seen Tina approaching, Gary blocks him from shutting the door and tells him \\"Come out and fight me like a man or are you scared?\\" David shoves Gary back and after a few more words the pair fight. Gary gets the better of it and David is left on the floor after the fight, later it emerges that he has a broken nose and concussion. After the fight, Gary flees but he is arrested upon his return. Tina lies to the police after David tells her to and the story also received media attention ahead of the air date. Gary starts to become very worried that he is going to prison as Tina continues to persist with her claims. He becomes very angry when he discovers that Len has been intimidating Tina into changing her story and apologises to her for Len's behaviour. On 2 March 2009, Gary's court hearing takes place, during which Tina admits to the prosecution that she had been lying about who started the fight. Gary is cleared of the assault charge much to his relief and his family's delight. A few months after the verdict, David begins plotting against Gary. He steals tools from Kevin's garage which belonged to Kevin's father Bill (Peter Armitage) and lets Gary take the blame for it, only to defend him, this is a way for him to make Gary believe the air is cleared between the pair as they shake hands and make up. David tricks Gary into buying stolen goods from him - but they actually belong to Graeme. In June 2009, David takes full revenge on Gary when Gail and his grandmother Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) go abroad. He tricks Gary into robbing a house - which is Audrey's - David steals the keys and hides all photos of his family so Gary will not know whose house he is burgling. While David deliberately stays at home during the burglary, he asks Graeme to spy on Gary as he goes to the house, Gary is about to go home when he hears that David is not coming, but instead goes into the house. Graeme tells David about this via phone and David tells him to call the police. However, David's grandfather Ted Page (Michael Byrne), who is housesitting, arrives at Audrey's. Gary sees him and pushes him as he tries to make a run for it, while Ted chases him. Ted recognises him and calls the police. Gary returns to the Street only to see a police car outside his house. He has no choice but to run away. David's plan to frame Gary and get rid of him has tragic consequences as Ted later has a heart attack, which he survives. Len offers Gary an alibi, but Gary is still arrested, only to be released later. Gary realises that David has set him up and attacks him, warning him not to cross him again. Gary had told his parents and the police that he wasn't robbing Audrey's house, however, he later tells his parents the truth and decides to confess to the police. Gary apologises to Ted for what happened - although this is halted by David - Ted accepts the apology and even helps build bridges between Gail and the Windass family. However, the Windass family have since been shunned by the rest of the Street, when Gary goes to the corner shop, he is ignored by Tina and taunted by Minnie Chandra (Poppy Jhakra), although Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns) is less judgmental. Gary and his father, Eddie Windass (Steve Huison) are told to get out of the kebab shop by Tina and are later ridiculed by Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle) and Sean Tully (Antony Cotton). On 26 June 2009, Gary is sentenced, much to the delight of David, however, Gary tells the police about David's involvement in the burglary and David is the one who is shunned as a result. While Gary is incarcerated, David is beaten up on the street by an unknown attacker. When Gary is released, he gleefully reveals to David that he organised it. In November 2009, Gary makes an insulting remark about the armed forces when he sees Ted wearing a poppy for Remembrance Day. Ted and Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) vent their anger at Gary, who takes it to heart, apologising to Ted the next day and asks to hear about his days of service. Ted's stories soon lead Gary to go on a taster weekend for the army, after which he decides to sign up. On 15 January 2010, an emotional going away party is held for him in the Rovers, David shakes hands with him, whilst slyly putting an archery target on his back. Anna is furious when she discovers this, Gary tells her not to rise to it and calls David a 'loser' in front of everyone, it appears that the pub are more on Gary's side. After a tearful goodbye, he says goodbye to his parents and leaves in the back of a cab. Gary returns several weeks later with Luke \\"Quinny\\" Quinn (Steven Bell), a friend who is also in the armed forces. During their visit, Quinny receives news that his brother, also serving in the Army, has lost his legs in a roadside bomb. The news makes Gary and Anna even more anxious about potentially going to war. Indeed, several weeks later, Gary goes AWOL through fear of what might happen in a warzone. He is discovered by David who agrees to keep quiet. However, upon seeing the stress Anna is under, David informs the Windass parents of Gary's whereabouts. Eddie later convinces him to return to the Army. In September 2010, Gary and Quinny return for another visit before they go to Afghanistan. Becky McDonald's (Katherine Kelly) half-sister Kylie Turner (Paula Lane) sets her sights on Gary and the two end up sleeping together in Mary Taylor's (Patti Clare) motor home. Gary soon tires of Kylie, however, and attempts to win the affection of Izzy Armstrong (Cherylee Houston). To prove himself, he stands up to a man who makes an insulting comment about Izzy's disability. Gary and Quinny later get into a fight outside the Rovers with the men in question, and Gary punches the thug. A passing Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment) tells Gary and Quinny to go before anybody sees them. Kirk later takes the blame for the attack, with a relieved Gary thankful to Kirk for saving his Army career. The night before he heads out to Afghanistan, Gary finally gets together with Izzy. An army officer visits Anna and Eddie in November 2010, informing them that Gary was involved in a roadside bomb and is severely injured whereas the other troops, including Quinny, had died as a result. He also states that Gary will be sent to Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham in Birmingham. Roy Cropper (David Neilson) informs the public at the Rovers about the tragic news and as a mark of respect he requests a 2-minute silence. Gary is psychologically and emotionally scarred as a result of the attack. He lashes out at those around him, including Anna. He plans on visiting Quinny's bereaved parents but cannot face it and doesn't go. The chaotic aftermath of the street's tram crash on 6 December 2010 triggers Gary's post-traumatic stress disorder and he is forced to flee to his home where he breaks down in tears. He becomes increasingly more withdrawn and begins drinking alone much to the concern of Izzy, Eddie and Anna. Eventually, Gary manages to deal with this problem himself and eventually faces Quinny's parents which seemed to have helped him a lot. Gary becomes obsessed with Izzy's welfare. He takes a job at Underworld so he can be around Izzy more. Izzy goes into town with Sean and Julie Carp (Katy Cavanagh) to get away from Gary for a while, only to get robbed by a cash point. Gary then takes Izzy's wheelchair away so she cannot leave the house and says he will later return it. He then keeps her imprisoned in the house until Izzy's father Owen (Ian Puleston-Davies) rescues Izzy. He then breaks up with Izzy. When Owen takes an interest in Anna, her adopted daughter Faye Butler (Ellie Leach) steals Owen's phone so that she and Anna can go to the cinema as planned instead of Anna meeting Owen at The Rovers. Faye later sends Anna a message that Owen does not want to meet her. After Anna finds out about the situation she tells Owen she is not interested. Later, Owen and Anna sleep together. Anna does not know if she has made the right decision so she tells Gary, who then sets Owen and Anna up at The Bistro. By then, Faye and Gary have gradually bonded. In July 2012, Izzy and Gary decide to have a baby. Izzy miscarries and they try to adopt, but can't due to Gary's criminal record. Izzy's sister Katy (Georgia May Foote) offers to be a surrogate mother to their baby. At first, they all agree, but Katy's ex-boyfriend Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) refuses to let them do it. Chesney agrees but Izzy sees it isn't fair so she calls it off ‚Äì she also breaks up with Gary because of his desire to be a dad and her not being able to give him that. They reunite and eventually select Tina as their surrogate after Owen offers to pay her. Tina is successfully impregnated with Gary and Izzy's child in November 2012, and her pregnancy goes smoothly for the first trimester, although Tina grows aggravated at Gary's interference. However, in April 2013, Gary's feelings for Tina become more romantic after Izzy leaves an antenatal class due to Gary's touching of Tina. Gary later acts on his feelings for Tina and makes a pass at her, but she rejects him. Izzy overhears Gary and Tina discussing what happened and as the pair argue Tina goes into labour. Tina gives birth to a baby boy prematurely, and Izzy stops Gary from seeing him as he tried to cheat on her. As Gary and Izzy continue to argue, Tina becomes convinced they won't make good parents so she decides to name the baby Joe and keep him for herself. Izzy and Gary visit lawyers but find out it will take years to get Joe back. Gary is devastated when Izzy gives up fighting and tells Tina she can keep Joe. Afterwards, Izzy begins to soften towards Gary and he moves back in with her. In October 2013, Gary learns that Owen is having trouble with being owed ¬£4,000 from his client Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre). He later helps Owen break into Phelan's house to steal his motorcycle and lock the vehicle into his yard, which later forced Phelan to repay his debt to Owen. Later on, Phelan and his wife Valerie (Caroline Berry) visited the Armstrong-Windass family around Christmas that year. Phelan proposed that Gary and Owen work alongside him on a building project that will allow them to make ¬£200,000 in exchange for Owen investing his ¬£80,000 savings onto the project, to which he reluctantly agrees. In 2014 onwards, the partnership seems to go well at first until Gary learns from Izzy that Phelan has developed sexual feelings towards Anna. This prompts Gary to confront Phelan when all the builders, including Owen, have left the worksite. As Gary demands that Phelan stay away from his mother, Phelan begins to badmouth Anna - which causes Gary to punch Phelan in response. This results in the pair fighting, with Phelan getting the upper hand until Gary picks up a plank of wood and uses it to hit the latter - knocking Phelan unconscious as a result. Gary, believing to have killed Phelan, calls Owen to tell him what has happened and later brings him to the worksite ‚Äî where they are surprised to find that Phelan has vanished. A few days later in March 2014, Phelan reappears at Weatherfield and summons Gary and Owen without the rest of their family's knowledge ‚Äî implicitly telling the duo how he plans to get revenge on them over the incident. When they attempt to end their partnership with Phelan at the following morning, he takes Gary and Owen into the site office and shows them a CCTV footage of Gary attacking him. Phelan assures Gary and Owen that he has further copies and then demands that either they complete the work for a minimum wage ‚Äî gleaning no profit ‚Äî or he would hand the CCTV footage into the police. Despite Gary's reluctance, Owen complies with Phelan's orders as he does not want his grandson Jake to grow up without a father figure if Gary were to be sent to prison. Phelan relishes in blackmailing Owen and Gary, such as ordering the former to wash his car and getting the latter to bury a grave for a dead pigeon. This effectively strains Owen and Gary's friendship, as they begin to take their frustrations out of each other as well as their family. Phelan continues to overwork the pair by forcing them to remove perfectly fitted windows from the building his crewmen are working on, an act which nearly causes Gary to lash out at Phelan until Owen quickly separates him. Gary soon plans to get even on Phelan by stealing a shipment of tiles from him, but Phelan quickly finds out that it was Gary and was ready to report him to the police until Owen manages to stop him ‚Äî pointing out that Gary's wages are already being docked because of the situation he caused in the first place. Phelan agrees not to report Gary to the police, but instead tells Owen that he'll be keeping the ¬£80,000 that he invested onto their project ‚Äî which turns out to be what Phelan had intended to do all along to exact revenge on Owen for stealing his motorbike and being forced to pay what was owed. Owen later blames Gary for the predicament that he caused Phelan to inflicted upon them. When Phelan takes Valerie on a holiday trip the next day, Gary breaks into their house in an attempt to extract the CCTV footage. However, Owen quickly stops him in his tracks ‚Äî reminding Gary that Phelan has multiple copies. The two start planning on seeking other job placements in order to prevent Phelan from blackmailing them any further, but this fails when Phelan learns about the break-in at his house and deduces Gary's involvement. In retaliation, Phelan arranges for Owen to be removed from the council's list of approved builders ‚Äî effectively blacklisting him, which meant Owen could no longer get any independent work. In April 2014, Gary and Owen are surprised when Phelan later tells the pair that he relieving them from his project and later departs Weatherfield. This relieves Gary and Owen, but the pair are later devastated when Anna admits that she is the reason why Phelan released them from his contract; Phelan had blackmailed her into sleeping with him, effectively raping Anna as a result. Moreover, Gary's friendship with Owen is further strained when the latter punches him during an argument over their ordeal ‚Äî which proves evident when the bailiffs turn up to clear Owen of his debts that he is unable to repay as a result of what Phelan did to them. Eventually, Owen makes amends with Gary and later departs Weatherfield the following year after he and Anna are unable to resume their relationship. By 2015, Gary has already formed a relationship with one of his newest neighbors - Alya Nazir (Sair Khan). The two first met in the club during a night out, and he later woke up the following morning in her bed, but Alya reassures him nothing happened. Gary soon splits from Izzy and when Alya apologizes to Izzy after believing they split due to her and Gary kissing. Gary and Alya soon start going out, but Alya dreads telling her family and when Gary and Alya spend time at Alya's house, Alya's father Kal (Jimi Mistry) and grandmother Yasmeen (Shelley King) catch them in a compromising position and misunderstands the situation. Gary and Alya's relationship is soon accepted by Alya's family, though her brother Zeedan Nazir (Qasim Akhtar) takes more time. After Kal's death, Gary proposes to Alya, but Alya isn't sure after sleeping with Gary's friend Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas); however, she later changes her mind. Alya confesses to Gary that she slept with someone else and Gary is led to believe it is her boss Aidan Connor (Shayne Ward) who slept with her. Gary plans to confront Aidan until Jason admits that he slept with Alya. After overcoming another broken relationship, Gary goes to Germany to stay with his dad until he later returns in 2016 - whereupon he insists on working at the gym. Whilst working there, Gary befriends David's niece Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon) after she collapses as a result of taking diet pills that she purchased from the internet. He confronts her about the pills and she confides in him about her GCSE results. In October 2016, Gary rescues David's daughter Lily (Brooke Malonie) when she is nearly run-over father - who was driving in a petrol-soaked car in an attempt to kill Clayton Hibbs (Callum Harrison), the convict who killed Kylie back in July 2016, but ended up trapped underneath the car after David was barely able to swerve out of the way before flipping the vehicle over. David and the other residents of the street were able to lift the car to free Gary and Lily before a spark caused the car to explode. Gary then watched in horror as a fireball from the car struck Anna and set her on fire, but Kevin and Nick were able to extinguish the flames. Gary later went with a badly burned Anna to hospital, where she gradually recovered from her injuries. Gary soon learns that David is to blame for Anna's predicament when Bethany's mother, Sarah (Tina O'Brien), privately tells him the truth about the incident. This results in Gary confronting and punching David, but he later forgives him at Sarah's urging. Gary and Sarah quickly form a relationship afterwards, despite Bethany developing romantic feelings towards Gary. The couple and David soon work together with the latter's new girlfriend, Shona Ramsey (Julia Goulding), to imprison her ex-boyfriend Nathan Curtis (Christopher Harper) after learning that he has been sexually grooming and exploiting Bethany into his pimp business. They are eventually successful when Nathan and his conspirators, including corrupt policeman Neil Clifton (Ben Cartwright) and fellow accomplice Ian Yardley (Anthony Bowers), are all found guilty of raping Bethany and receive maximum prison sentences. It is at this point where Phelan has returned to Weatherfield after his marriage with Valerie fell apart thanks to her learning about what he did to the Armstrong and Windass families. His feud with Gary resurfaces when Gary confronts Phelan upon spotting him at the garage, but Anna urges him to stay away from Phelan for his own safety. Despite this, they continue to clash as Phelan sparks the events of Jason leaving Weatherfield by sabotaging his business empire and later usurping his position as the landlord of Weatherfield. This escalates when Phelan defrauds Sarah, along with Alya's grandmother Yasmeen Nazir (Shelley King) and her friend Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox), in his flats scam project called \\"Calcutta Street\\" ‚Äî which culminates with Phelan causing the death of Sarah's stepfather Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis) by watching him die of a heart attack without providing help. As Gary helps Sarah and her family nurse over Michael's death, he finds himself having to embark on some dangerous jobs in Ukraine in order to repay some of his debts. He soon confines his troubles with Phelan's long-lost daughter, Nicola Rubinstein (Nicola Thorp), and the two later have a one-night stand. Gary quickly regrets upon learning that Nicola is Phelan's daughter and he initially tells her to stay away from him, but later befriends Nicola after she discovers what Phelan did to him and Anna. Their companionship becomes troubled when Nicola learns that she is pregnant and Gary finds out that he is the father. Moreover, Phelan has set-up Anna for pushing Faye's boyfriend Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) off a ladder in retaliation for turning Nicola against him. Despite his efforts to prove his mother's innocence, Anna is found guilty for Seb's accident and is sentenced to five years imprisonment; Gary misses the verdict after being mugged whilst he and Bethany's close friend, Craig Tinker (Colson Smith), attempt to stop her from working as a lap dancer. Following Anna's imprisonment, Gary continues with her campaign to bring Phelan to justice for his crimes against them. He teams up with Nicola and Seb, along with Faye's father Tim Metcalfe (Joe Duttine), to prove that Phelan is responsible for killing their neighbour Luke Britton (Dean Fagan) ‚Äî after Seb had deduced that Phelan is the killer upon being manipulated by the latter into touching his gun, the weapon that Phelan used to kill Luke, and later finding out that Luke had been shot before dying in a vehicle explosion. Their efforts seem futile at first until Seb later tells Gary that he believes Phelan has hidden the gun at his worksite, which leads the pair to try and uncover it. However, they are surprised to learn that Phelan has actually hidden two bodies at the worksite ‚Äî which nevertheless exposes the truth about Phelan killing Michael and Luke. It soon transpires that the two bodies were Phelan's business partner Vinny Ashford (Ian Kelsey) and Luke's best-friend Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) ‚Äî both of whom Phelan killed after keeping Andy captive in an abandoned warehouse for nearly the entirety of 2017 and uses the opportunity to exact revenge on Vinny for betraying him at the conclusion of their \\"Calcutta Street\\" scam. With Phelan's crimes exposed and presumed dead following a showdown with Jason's mother Eileen (Sue Cleaver), whom he previously married back in January 2017, Gary is granted ownership of the yard and helps Faye collaborate with their friend Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard) planning to secure Anna's release from her false imprisonment. During the preparations, Gary is hospitalized after David brutally assaults him during a charity boxing match between them. While Sarah is left outraged at her brother's behaviour, Gary grows concerned for David and is surprised to later find out that he had been raped by his new friend Josh Tucker (Ryan Clayton). In May 2018, Nicola ends up giving birth to her and Gary's child - Zack. However, Gary doesn't show up at the hospital while Nicola is giving birth upon making a discovery - Phelan has resurfaced. He plans to get revenge on Phelan for what he did to his family over the past four years and ends up tracking him from his hiding place in Albergele. Gary then calls his ex-militant associate, Joe Haslam (Chord Melodic), to help with his plans - though Joe initially refuses at first and leaves Gary on his own. However, after Phelan overpowers Gary upon being attacked, Joe returns and knocks Phelan unconscious before he could harm Gary. Together, they bring Phelan back to Weatherfield and hold him captive in the yard - where Sarah returns and discovers the situation just as Joe leaves the area. As Gary attempts to stop Sarah from calling the police whilst ignoring her efforts to talk him out of revenge, Phelan manages to free himself and subdues Gary by hitting him with a chair. Phelan then retrieves his gun, locks Gary and Sarah in the yard, and proceeds to confront Eileen and Nicola so he could get to see Zack. While attempting to escape, Gary and Sarah are released from their captivity by Anna - who herself has been released from prison at the time Phelan was presumed dead. The trio promptly rush off to stop Phelan, who ends up shooting Nicola after she tried to disarm him. As Anna heads down to confront Phelan at the Bistro, where he has instigated, Gary retrieves Zack in his arms whilst Sarah rushes over to Eileen and Seb - who were both knocked unconscious by Phelan during the struggle. Eventually, Anna prevents Phelan from escaping Weatherfield by stabbing him with a knife - though not before the latter ended up shooting the restaurant's co-owner Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh); however, she survives whilst Phelan dies from Anna's stabbing. Following Phelan's death, Anna leaves Weatherfield and Gary manages to make amends with Nicola after she discovers that he was the reason behind Phelan's siege. Nicola eventually leaves Weatherfield with Zack, despite Gary's initial protests. In 2019, nearly a year later after Phelan's death, Gary retrieves Sarah's phone from her boss and Michelle's best-friend Carla (Alison King) - which transpires that Gary is responsible for sabotaging the roof at the Underworld Factory, thus causing the death of Alya's sister-in-law Rana Habeeb (Bhavna Limbachia) after she died from the roof collapse. By then, Gary finds himself in debt to Tina's loan shark Rick Neelan (Greg Wood) and is forced to work for him. When Rick later attempts to kill Gary in a bid to tie up loose ends of his loan sharking activities, Gary ends up killing Rick by beating him to death with a rock. He manages to cover-up his involvement in both Rana's death and Rick's murder, but this contributes to his aggressive behaviour that results in Sarah ending their relationship. He soon clashes with Rana's brother Imran (Charlie de Melo) over the circumstances behind his sister's death, and later becomes enemies with his colleague Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson) - particularly as Sarah and Adam end up developing romantic feelings for each other. Gary soon bonds with Michelle and Carla's sister-in- law, Maria (Samia Longchambon), and they form a relationship. This escalates as Maria's ex-boyfriend Ali Neeson (James Burrows), who recently dumped Maria after inadvertently leaving her son Liam in danger, develops a feud with Gary after discovering his status as a loan-shark - with Gary having assumed ownership of Rick's criminal empire after the latter's death. Moreover, Ali's brother Ryan (Ryan Prescott) - whom Gary previously clashed over his broken relationship with Katy - has unwittingly stolen Gary's money from his desk at his shop. Gary later beats up Ryan after the latter is unable to repay him the money back. Overtime, Gary plans to usurp control of the Underworld Factory and conducts a plan where his client Derek Milligan (Craige Els) - who owes Gary money - is summoned to pose as a businessman seeking to rebuild the Underworld Factory. Gary soon blackmails Derek into upholding his scheme to takeover the factory, going as far as to threaten his family should he not comply with his orders. However, when Derek attempts to stand up to Gary and nearly foils his scheme as a result, Gary retaliates by holding him captive until Christmas Eve that year. Because of this, Derek has lost his last-chance of reconciling with his ex-wife and their children. Seeking retribution, Derek steals a gun from Gary's shop and ends up instigating a siege in The Rovers while trying to find Gary. When Gary attempts to call his bluff, Derek fires the gun to prove his intent on killing Gary - unknowingly shooting Michelle's estranged husband, Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill), in the process. Derek's siege culminates with him and Gary fighting near a roof, whereupon Shona gets shot during the struggle - wherein Gary also gets shot before Derek ends up tumbling below the roof. Gary attempts to bring Derek up to safety, but loses his grip and could only watch as Derek falls to his death. Gary is later rushed to hospital, where he learns that Shona has recovered from her gunshot wound while Robert has died from his injuries. ==CreationBackground=== The character of Gary was created as part of a new family unit that new producer Kim Crowther introduced to the soap opera, consisting of a mother, father, son and uncle. They were originally billed as a storyline device for established character David Platt. An ITV spokesperson said of the character and his onscreen family: \\"The Windass family are very rough and ready, always ducking and diving. Early on they get involved with David Platt when he helps to fit a new kitchen in the Windass family home. However, Anna thinks the work is shoddy and refuses to pay for it. David goes round, rips out the kitchen and sets fire to it outside the family‚Äôs house.\\" fellow actress Debbie Rush said of their entrance and choice of surname for the family, that they would be prepared for the public taunts they would receive for their surname. The character was originally called Carl Windass but was changed last minute to Gary Windass after a series of name changes to all the members of the family since their inception, but before appearing on screen. Upon their on-screen arrival it panned out almost as planned seeing him arrive as the son of Eddie and Anna Windass. He and his uncle Len went after David Platt and Joe McIntyre after David menaced his parents into handing over the money they owed for a new kitchen. Even though he has been brought up by his parents Gary looks up to his uncle who has had a heavy impact on his personality and his antics on the wrong side of the law. ==DevelopmentPersonality and identity=== The character of Gary is quite one-sided at first with him being presented as a typical bad boy. Actor Mikey North who portrays the character told the Scarborough Evening News that he is a hard nut type of guy but has plenty more side to come out stating: \\"Gary has a lot of sides to him. He is a bit of a hard nut, but also a charmer with the ladies.\\". Also he calls his character a lovable rogue. His traits and personality are based on what his onscreen uncle tells him to act like and in an interview with media website Digital Spy he talks about this saying: \\"He gets it all from his uncle Len, who in a way is his idol. Gary copies his uncle and wants to be like him, even though he realises that it's not the best thing to do.\\" In the same interview he also speaks about the fact that Gary is in love with himself and thinks he can get any girl he wants with his own one-liners and the fact he loves to know that he is succeeding in winding people up with his antics. Popular Corrie coverage website Corrieblog described the character as cunning in the 'thick way' as he knows he would have to face consequences for fighting after he continually wound fellow character David Platt up. After six months of the character being on-screen, North commented more about his character saying: \\"The first time you step onto the Street you have to stamp your mark as to what kind of character you are. At first Gary was shouty and happy to be aggressive, but the more you see it, his nicer side is coming out. In the run-up to the court case you see him showing affection towards his family. He fears the worst. He thinks he's going to go down. He's worried about his mum too.\\" ==Reception== Tony Stewart of The Mirror said of Gary that David Platt has met his match in the character and the two of them have enough criminal convictions, Asbos and restraining orders to wallpaper over their living room and comparing Gary and his family's criminal record to that of the Battersbys', saying the latter compared to them it's like a day out with the Von Trapp family. Grace Dent of The Guardian stated her love for the Windass family and of the character Gary, and she went on to describe him stating: \\"Gary Windass loves thieving cars, stealing tools from vans, spitting globs of phlegm between his front teeth and, at the mere hint of sunshine, strutting about with his top off wearing trakkie-beeees that cry out for a good boil wash. But that's fine by me as he's TWOC'd all of David Platt's thunder..\\" MSN branded Gary and his family as chavs (Gary being the prime example) and being perfect guests for the Jeremy Kyle show, and going on to calling them a million miles away from lower class yobbish families 'The Mortons' and 'The Battersbys'. Whereas Simon Swift of Soaplife magazine commented on the fact that on first looks he couldn't help feeling that Gary and the rest of the clan are a bit too much like original neighbours-from-hell the Battersbys. The character was also noted for the big impression he made within the soap in such a short space of time by Rick Fulton of The Daily Record So much so that he has been nominated for Villain Of The Year in The British Soap Awards 2009, which he did not go on to win. Kris Green of media website Digital Spy praised and commented on the fact that Gary and her family had 'settled in so well, in such a short space of time', with actor Mikey North stating that their success is down to the good writing and many plotlines the family received in the short time period. Mikey North also said that even though his character is a bad boy he has gained the public support after beating David Platt up, branding him as a legend for being the first one to do it. (The public loathe the character of David's antics) In August 2017, North was longlisted for Sexiest Male at the Inside Soap Awards. He did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist. ==References *Gary Windass at itv.com Category:Coronation Street characters Category:Fictional criminals on soap operas Category:Fictional British Army personnel Category:Television characters introduced in 2008 Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional characters with post-traumatic stress disorder Category:Fictional War in Afghanistan (2001‚Äìpresent) veterans Category:Fictional waiting staff Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping Category:Fictional characters with psychiatric disorders Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional construction workers Category:Male villains Category:Fictional henchmen Category:Fictional gangsters Category:Fictional people from Manchester ","title":"Gary Windass"},{"id":"20171609","text":"These are the results for the voting for the National Soccer Hall of Fame 2009 induction class.

Part of Patrol and Reconnaissance Wing Ten, VP-46 is the oldest maritime patrol squadron and the second oldest aircraft squadron in the entire U.S. Navy, second only behind VFA-14.VP-46 History The squadron was originally established as Patrol Squadron 5-S (VP-5S) on 1 July 1931, redesignated Patrol Squadron 5-F (VP-5F) on 1 April 1933, redesignated Patrol Squadron 5 (VP-5) on 1 October 1937, redesignated Patrol Squadron 33 (VP-33) on 1 July 1939, redesignated Patrol Squadron 32 (VP-32) on 1 October 1941, redesignated Patrol Bombing Squadron 32 (VPB-32) on 1 October 1944, redesignated Patrol Squadron 32 (VP-32) on 15 May 1946, redesignated Medium Patrol Squadron (Seaplane) 6 (VP-MS-6) on 15 November 1946 and redesignated Patrol Squadron 46 (VP-46) on 1 September 1948. ==Operational history== PM-2 and crew at NAS Coco Solo c.1934 P2Y-1 taking off, 1930s PBY-3 over Panama in 1939 P5M-1 firing HVAR rockets in the 1950s P-3C in 1989 VP-46 P-3C over Seattle in 2010 *1 July 1931: VP-5S was established at NAS Coco Solo, Panama Canal Zone, while on exercises at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, coming under Commander Air, Scouting Force with sister squadrons VPs 3S, 8S and 10S. Upon completion of Fleet Problem No. XII, newly designated VP-5S returned to its home base at NAS Coco Solo. *1 February 1932: VP-5S and VP-2S were transferred for patrol duties to NAS San Diego, California. *March 1932: VP-5S flew to San Francisco, to take part in Fleet Problem XIII, based on . They returned to San Francisco for Fleet Problem XIV in February 1933. *1 April 1933: VP-5S was redesignated VP-5F, under the organizational command of Base Force. *22 April 1933: VP-5F was reassigned to its old home base at NAS Coco Solo, with VP-2F. *May 1933: VP-5F flew from NAS Coco Solo to NAS Norfolk, Virginia, then on to Philadelphia, where the squadron's PM-2 aircraft were turned in. New P2Y-1 seaplanes were received at Norfolk and were prepared for the return trip to Coco Solo. In June the second division of six squadron aircraft returned to Coco Solo with several stops in Florida and Jamaica. *7 September 1933: The squadron's first division made the first nonstop flight from NAS Hampton Roads, Virginia, to NAS Coco Solo, in six new P2Y-1 seaplanes under the command of Lieutenant Commander Herman E. Halland. The squadron flew a distance of in 25 hours and 19 minutes, establishing the longest nonstop seaplane formation flight to date, surpassing the previous record by . Upon arrival, the six new aircraft were turned in to VP-10F in exchange for six slightly older P2Ys. *21 April 1934: VP-5F, 2F, 3F, 7F and 9F participated in Fleet Problem XV in support of fleet operations off Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. *1 January 1935: VPs 5F and 3F participated in exercises in the Caribbean to test seaplane operations in the open ocean from tenders USS Wright, , and . *August 1935: VPs 5F and 2F participated in advanced base operations in Trujillo Bay, Honduras, tended by USS Lapwing and USS Teal. *January 1936: VP-5F conducted advanced base operations at Santelmo Bay, Perlas Islands, tended by USS Teal. *23 February 1937: VP-5F participated in extended flight operations in the Caribbean with VP-2F, based at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Mayaguez and San Juan, Puerto Rico; St. Thomas, Culebra; and Balhia Honda, Colombia. *1 October 1937: VP-5F was redesignated VP-5 when Navy patrol squadrons were reorganized under the command of Patrol Wings. VPs 5, 2 and 3 came under Patrol Wing-3, NAS Coco Solo. *14 May ‚Äì 14 September 1938: VP-5 departed Coco Solo for NAS Norfolk, where the squadron turned in their P2Y-2 seaplanes. On 18 May the squadron arrived at NAS San Diego, California, to receive replacement PBY-3 Catalina aircraft and transition training in the new seaplanes. By August nearly all of the crews with the new aircraft had experienced problems with high noise levels in the PBY-3 while on patrols. The sources of the problems were found to be the lack of interior insulation in the aircraft and higher propeller tip speed. Subsequent production incorporated insulation and dressed down propeller tips that greatly reduced the noise problem. The squadron returned to NAS Coco Solo on 14 September 1938. *11 February 1939: PatWing-3 squadrons, including VPs 2, 3 and 5, participated in Fleet Problem No. XX as part of the Black Force during exercises in the Caribbean. VP-5 operated in the Semana area off Cuba, supported by . The exercises again pointed out the vulnerability of the patrol aircraft in the face of determined anti-aircraft (AA) fire from defending vessels, and the vulnerability of the patrol bases ashore to naval or air attack. *14 April 1939: VPs 5, 2 and 3 mapped of Central American coastline from Nicaragua to the Colombian border. This task was carried out despite weather conditions unfavorable for aerial photography. *11 September 1939: VP-33 was assigned to Neutrality Patrol duties in the Caribbean operating out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. *31 January 1940: VP-33's Neutrality Patrol duties were directed at covering convoys between the Canal Zone and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. *1 July 1940: The squadron had seven aircraft operating out of NAS Coco Solo and three out of San Juan.

Alessandro Ballan succeeded fellow Italian Paolo Bettini as World Champion, winning the road race in his home country, where Varese hosted the World Championships for the second time in history. Bettini and German sprinter Erik Zabel were among the most prominent riders to quit after this season, while Mario Cipollini made a brief comeback in the early months of the year. Despite even tighter controls and warnings concerning doping, and the introduction of the blood passport by the UCI, several major races, including the Giro and Tour were faced with positive tests. In addition, the ongoing feud between the UCI and the race organizations almost came to a definite break in March, when the UCI threatened to suspend riders participating in ASO's Paris‚ÄìNice. The cycling federation's ProTour seemed bankrupt halfway through the year when all remaining licensed teams announced their withdrawal. However, at the start of 2009, 16 teams saw their ProTour license renewed and two new teams joined the elite division of cycling. Cr√©dit Agricole and Gerolsteiner stopped sponsorship of a team, and were not succeeded by new sponsors. Other than Gerolsteiner, many German companies who participated in cycling sponsorship in recent years withdrew their financial backing after this year's latest of doping cases related to German cycling. As a result, fewer professional teams and races, among them the Deutschland Tour, will be part of the 2009 season. Amongst professional riders, Mark Cavendish was the most successful with 17 victories, including 4 in the Tour de France and two in the Giro d'Italia. His team, Team High Road (which got a new sponsor midway through the season, ever since going by the name Team Columbia), was by far the most successful with 77 victories.http://www.cqranking.com/men/asp/gen/VictoryRankingTeam.asp?year=2008 Alejandro Valverde was the most successful allround rider of the year based on the CQ ranking.http://www.cqranking.com/men/asp/gen/cqRankingRider.asp After the end of the season, seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong announced his comeback to competitive road cycling for 2009, with the Astana Team. ==Grand Tours== {class= style=\\"font-size:90%\\" width=\\"90%\\" -

The national government is composed of three arms: The Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. Each arm is independent of the other and their individual roles are set by the Constitution of Kenya. The full name of the country is the \\"Republic of Kenya\\". Its official Swahili name is 'Jamhuri ya Kenya'. Other terms such as GoK, GK and Serikali are popularly used to refer to the Kenyan government. ==History== The government was formed in 1963. However, Kenya didn't become a republic until 1964.History of Kenya  Republic of Kenya . Retrieved June 2, 2015. Initially, the head of government was the Prime Minister who was Jomo Kenyatta. He later on became the first President of Kenya. The current structure of government allows power to be held on two levels: The national level and the county level. This allows the Counties of Kenya a form of autonomy. Before the 2013 elections Kenya was under a central government with eight (8) provinces: # Central # Coast # Eastern # Nairobi # NorthEastern # Nyanza # Rift Valley # Western The country is a representative democracy legislatively, and a direct democracy in the election of its president, who is leader of the Executive branch of government. Kenya's constitution states that it is a multi-party democratic state founded on the national values and principles of governance referred to in Article 10. There are three arms of government, which operate independently and work to balance each other, based upon the \\"Separation of powers\\" principle. Before the 2013 general election the Judiciary wouldn't be considered as independent as it is today, and before the 1992 elections Kenya wasn't a multiparty state - all power was centered in the Executive with Daniel arap Moi as President. == The Legislative == The legislative branch includes the National Assembly and the Senate. ==The Executive== The Executive is charged with enforcing the law. The executive branch consists of the President, the Deputy President and the Cabinet. Cabinet meetings are held with the Attorney General present. ===President=== The Presidential Standard The President is the head of state and government, as in most republics. He is also the Commander-in-chief of the Kenya Defence Forces. The President has the power to appoint every leader within the executive including Cabinet Secretaries and the Attorney General. The incumbent is Uhuru Kenyatta son of the first President, Jomo Kenyatta. Kenya has had a total of 4 presidents. Two of the former Presidents, Mwai Kibaki and Daniel arap Moi (deceased). The longest serving president was Daniel arap Moi who served for a total of 24 years.Kenya profile  Timeline. Retrieved June 2, 2015. The National Assembly with at least a third of all the members, may set in motion an act to impeach the President. The National Assembly may do so on the grounds of gross violation of the Constitution or any other law, where there is reasons to believing that the President has committed a crime under national or international law or for gross misconduct. If the motion to impeach passes in the National Assembly the act to impeach moves to the Senate and if at least two-thirds of all the members of the Senate vote to uphold any impeachment charge, the President shall cease to hold office. ===Deputy President=== The Deputy President is the second-highest executive office in the republic. The position before the 2013 general election was known as the Vice-President of Kenya. There have been 11 deputy presidents since independence. The incumbent is William Ruto who as Uhuru Kenyatta is part of the Jubilee Alliance. The first person to hold the position was Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. The 8th person to hold the office, Michael Kijana Wamalwa was the first and only person to pass away while in office.Kenyan vice-president dies in London hospital. Retrieved June 2, 2015. George Saitoti has held the position twice on separate occasions. The Deputy President's functions are to be the main assistant to the President and shall deputise for the President in the execution of the President's functions. He must be qualified to become president in order to take the office as he is first in line in the order of presidential succession. The Deputy President as the president is limited to two terms in office. ===The Cabinet=== The Government is run by the Ministries of Kenya. The constitution limits the number of Ministries to a minimum of 14 and maximum of 22. The headings of the ministries are known as Cabinet Secretaries who are all nominated by the President. The President has power to assign and dismiss a Cabinet Secretary. A Cabinet Secretary cannot be an MP and their deputies are known as Principal Secretaries. All civil servants e.g. teachers in public schools or diplomats fall under one of the ministries in the Cabinet. ==The Judiciary== The Judiciary is charged with applying and upholding the law. This is done through a legal system consisting of courts. ===The Court System=== Supreme Court Buildings The Judiciary is led by the Chief Justice who is currently David Maraga. The highest court is the Supreme Court whose decisions are binding on all the other courts. The courts are divided into two levels: Superior Courts and Subordinate Courts. Superior Courts are the higher courts and are presided over by Judges. These are the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal, the High Court which hears almost every type of case., the Environment and Land Court and the Industrial Court. The subordinate courts consist of the Magistrates courts, the Kadhi courts, the Courts Martial and any other court or local tribunal as may be established by an Act of Parliament, other than the currently established courts. All Judges, including the Chief Justice and the Deputy Chief Justice, are selected by the Judicial Service Commission but are officially appointed by the President. However, the persons selected to be the Chief Justice and Deputy Chief Justice must first be vetted by Parliament before being appointed by the President. All other Judges do not need Parliamentary vetting and approval. Magistrates who preside over the subordinate courts are selected and appointed by the Judicial Service Commission without the involvement of the President or Parliament. ==Elections and voting== Map of the Counties of Kenya Elections in Kenya that predate 1992 were not multiparty elections. On independence, Kenya voted for Kenyatta as President. However, over the next few years Kenya slowly transitioned from being a democracy to being a one-party state. Kenyatta's regime greatly oversaw the gradual limitation of the democratic system. Kenyatta died in 1978; his vice President Moi took over and in 1982 the country was officially made a one-party state with every other party being outlawed. This was met by resistance over the next decade or so. In 1992 Kenya's first multiparty elections were held. Ever since then elections have been held every 5 years. In 2013 the general election paved the way for semi- autonomy of the 47 counties of Kenya. Uhuru Kenyatta, the incumbent won and his coalition the Jubilee Alliance now controls the majority in both houses of Parliament, i.e. the National Assembly and the Senate. The state allows universal suffrage based on the aspiration for fair representation and equality. The only people not allowed to vote are people convicted of an election offence during the preceding five years. Elections in Kenya are overseen by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission. ==County governments== The Counties of Kenya have devolved functions of the former central government. Each county has its own Governor who is directly elected and thereafter becomes the highest elected official in the county. Each county has its own County Assembly with MCAs (Members of the County Assembly) as representatives. The powers of the County are provided in Articles 191 and 192, and in the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution of Kenya and the County Governments Act of 2012. Functions and duties not assigned by the Constitution automatically become the National governments responsibility. As opposed to other devolved governments around the world, only the national government may impose income tax, value-added tax, customs duties and other duties on import and export goods and excise tax. The counties are individually allowed to impose property rates, entertainment taxes and any other tax that it is authorised to impose by an Act of Parliament. ==See also== ; President * The Cabinet * The Judiciary * The Supreme Court ; Law * The Constitution ; Counties * Counties ==References * myGov, the official GoK portal. * OpenData Kenya, Government Stats  Open Data Initiative * The Presidency, The Presidency  GoK Category:1963 establishments in Kenya ","title":"Government of Kenya"},{"id":"20171681","text":"Qƒ±rxƒ±ncƒ± is a village in the municipality of Burkandul in the Lerik Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==References== Category:Populated places in Lerik District ","title":"Qƒ±rxƒ±ncƒ±"},{"id":"20171696","text":"The Optimist is a 1984 album by the New Zealand band DD Smash led by Dave Dobbyn.

Monrad was the son of Carl Alexander Metzgen, the former Auditor General (1911) of Belize, British Honduras. Metzgen's mother, Esther Almira Bevans (born on 17 January 1869 in Belize and died 1944), was the second wife of his father (the first one was Estelle Greene). His father, Carl Alexander Metzgen (born on 24 July 1860 and killed in Pet√©n on 13 March 1930). His grandfather, Charles Alexander Metzgen, was born 1816 in Copenhagen, Denmark and was son of Johan Christian Metzgen (1784‚Äì1843) a retired Danish naval officer. Monrad had three children: Louise MBE, Humphrey and Frederick (Bill). He died of poisoning, on 14 May 1956 On 17 September 2009, Metzgen was posthumously awarded the Order of Distinction from the Government of Belize in recognition of his dedication to Community and Public Service. ==Government service== In Belize he received his education at St. Mary‚Äôs Primary School, and later at Wesley School and the Diocesan High School for Boys (now St. Michael's College) before entering the British Honduras Civil Service as a Temporary Clerk at Her Majesty's Prison on 4 March 1910. Capt. Metzgen entered the Civil Service as a Copyist on 4 March 1910, and ten years later he was appointed Internal Revenue Officer. Subsequently he acted as District Commissioner in Orange Walk, an Auditor and then Director of Colonial Audits. He was made Chief Income Tax Collector in January 1924. He was Treasury Superintendent in 1932 and District Commissioner in Stann Creek in 1935. A serious, near-fatal accident eventually caused his retirement in 1939. On several occasions he acted as District Commissioner of the Orange Walk District and as Auditor; and he received special commendation from the Director of Colonial Audit for work done during the period 1927‚Äì28. He was appointed Treasury Superintendent in September 1932. He held this position for three years and assumed the Commissionership of the Stann Creek District in September 1935. Last year he promoted a successful Goodwill Flight, which took him and other leading citizens of Stann Creek to every section of the Colony. That was the forerunner of a mammoth Agricultural Exhibition planned for Stann Creek, but his retirement precluded the carrying out of his plans. His retirement was hastened by a disaster in the Stann Creek Valley, when he was nearly crushed to death in a collision. He spent a long period in Stann Creek, Belize and Guatemala City Hospital. ===Posts held=== * Acting Asst. Keeper, King's Warehouse * Internal Revenue Officer * Principal Officer, Income Tax * Special Officer of Customs * Acting Colonial Auditor * Acting District Commissioner of the Orange Walk District * Chief Income Tax Collector; Treasury Superintendent * Private Secretary (temporarily) to the Acting Governor (Lt. Col. Maxwell Hinds Smith) on a special mission to the Cayo District in 1922 * Secretary or Member of numerous Government and other Boards and Committees, including in 1926 the Fort George Hotel Committee * Member of the Belize Town Board (now the City Council). ==Military service== Metzgen joined the British Honduras Mounted Infantry on 1 March 1906 and the next year he went with the force, under Major F.M. Maxwell, to quell a riot at the Stann Creek Railway. The same year he accompanied the force again to Sapodilla Cayes on the \\"City of Belize\\" to assist in preventing filibustering on the coast of General Bonilla of Honduras. In 1915 he applied to join the War Contingent but his application was not approved owing to the number of Civil Servants that had already obtained permission to enlist. He was appointed 2nd Lieutenant of the British Honduras Territorial Forces in June, 1918 and on the formation of the Defence Force in 1928 he was appointed a Lieutenant of this Force. He was in charge of the Defence Force during the first two days after the Belize hurricane of September 1931. ==Civil society== Metzgen was a member of the Church of England in British Honduras. Metzgen was the founder of the British Honduras Agricultural Society and helped stage the agricultural and industrial exhibitions in 1928 and 1931. In 1927 he convened at Belize an agricultural conference which brought together planters from all sections of the Colony. He was a member of the Agricultural Advisory Committee appointed by His Excellency the Governor and Chief Justice Greenidge as Chairman. For three terms he was a Member of the Belize Town board under the chairmanship of the Rev. Robert Cleghorn OBE, and for a period he was a member of the Belize Electricity Board. For several years he was Chairman of the St George's Caye Day Celebrations Committee at Belize. He served with the Honorable C. Douglas- Jones and the Honorable Willoughby Bullock on a Treasury Inquiry Committee and he was Secretary to the Colonial Lindbergh's Reception Committee and a Hotel (for Belize) Committee of which the late Honorable Sally Wolffsohn was Chairman. He also acted as Private Secretary for His Excellency Colonel Maxwell Hinds with on a special mission of investigation to El Cayo. He was the first Treasurer of the Infant Welfare League. He was the first President of the Eureka Band and the first President of the Native Jockey Club. He gave to Stann Creek flourishing Poor Relief Organisations. ===Road campaign=== Realising that the lack of roads would retard the agricultural development of the Colony, Metzgen produced propaganda for Ford with the slogan \\"Roads, Roads and Still More Roads\\". He organized and was the Chairman of the British Honduras Cyclists Association and his Cross Country Cycle Races demonstrated in a tangible manner the urgency of a road programme for the Colony. ===Education campaign=== Metzgen was Chairman of the Debating Club for 10 years and campaigned for the establishment of a Public Library and a Town Hall for Belize. A \\"Handbook of British Honduras\\" was compiled by him in 1925, with the assistance of Mr. H.E.C. Cain, during the administration of Sir Eyre Hutson KCMG. He was Assistant Editor of the Archives of British Honduras, of which the late Sir John Alder Burdon was Editor, and he compiled the booklets \\"Blazing Trails in British Honduras\\", \\"Shoulder to Shoulder\\" and the \\"Standing Rules and Orders of the Orange Walk District Board\\", 1924. ===Travels=== His travels took him to Guatemala City, New Orleans, New York City and London. During his visits to the latter three cities in 1925 he studied various income tax systems through the courtesy of the Income Tax Officials of those cities. By means of illustrated lectures, he brought the great Wembley Exhibition from England to the CUs Theatres in Belize and was supported by the late Honorable Lieutenant Colonel Dr. James Cran OBE and Mr. F.R. Dragten OBE, KC. At the Shipmates Club at Stann Creek and at the Eureka Band Concert at the Park, Metzgen addressed the people of the District in 1935. He thanked them for the cooperation he received from them during his administration and for their prayers and attention during his recent illness. In this connection he said that one of the things that will always linger in his memory is an act three Carib women‚Äîall unknown to him‚Äîwho travelled from Stann Creek to Belize just to see him in the Hospital where they knelt at his bedside and prayed for his recovery. He had hoped to inaugurate a five-year plan for Stann Creek with the aim of laying a sound economic foundation for that District. He hoped Stann Creek would get a District Commissioner who will serve her better than he did and he promised that during his retirement he will be ready and willing to serve the District and the colony in any way he can. ==Sporting legacy== In 1928, on a bicycle ride in the country on the Northern Highway, Metzgen conceived the idea of what became the first Cross Country Cycling Classic having been struck by the number of bicycles Belizeans used to attend weekly cricket games in rural areas. He developed the idea for a cycling \\"expedition\\" to San Ignacio in order to test the cyclists' ability to cope with a then- badly built Western Highway. The Governor pledged support and offered a cup as a prize to the winner of the race‚Äîa race that is still held annually. He enlisted the support of such notables at Matron L.M. Roberts of the Public Hospital Royal Bank of Canada local manager Charles Beattie, Frans Dragten, Reverend Cleghorn, medical officer Lieutenant Colonel James Cran and that of a young surveyor, Henry Fairweather. Within a month he had the whole programme together and launched. On 2 April 1928, a parade and inspection of the cyclists was organised by Metzgen and attended by the Governor, Superintendent of Police and others, who congratulated the cyclists and sent them on a parade through the town's streets. The official race kicked off on 5 April 1928 from in front of the courthouse at 5:00 AM. The trail was along the Western Highway to San Ignacio (55 miles from Belize City). The first rider into Cayo (90 miles in total), Elston Kerr, was cheered for making it into town in about 13 hours. The men stayed through the Easter holidays, feasting, eating, playing cricket and soaking up the accolades of the Cayo faithful. They also visited Benque Viejo del Carmen and San Jose Succotz, the westernmost settled areas in Cayo. On 9 April, the expeditionists set off at 5:00 AM to return to the City, their progress reliably reported through of all things, the telephone service. Kerr, of Burrell Boom, finished first in 21 hours 29 minutes, 81 minutes ahead of second place Norris Wade, also of Boom. Race organizer Metzgen finished in 30 and a half hours. Subsequent to the race, Metzgen formed and chaired the British Honduras Cyclists Association in June 1928. As a result of his experience in the race, he was a key proponent of improved public roads ensuring that successive Governors of the Colony became interested in road building. ==Bibliography== In 1925, with H. E. C. Cain, he wrote \\"The Handbook of British Honduras\\". The book includes over fifty Creole proverbs, proverbs like, Cuss-cus neighbor bore hole & Dawg hab liberty fi watch gubnor. In 1928 he wrote \\"Blazing Trails in British Honduras\\" about the first Cross-Country race. (The book was recently reprinted by the Belize Historical Society). In the late 1920s he worked on the \\"Archives of British Honduras\\", edited by the Governor, Sir John Burdon and compiled the pamphlet \\"Shoulder to Shoulder or The Battle of St. George's Caye.\\" The Handbook of British Honduras, by Monrad Metzgen and H.E.C. Cain, the Brief Sketch of British Honduras, by John Burdon, former governor and the Book Shoulder to Shoulder by Monrad Metzgen, all talk about the exploits of the Baymen. ==Further reading== * Handbook of British Honduras: Henry Edney Conrad Cain and Monrad Metzgen * Monrad Metzgen: Notes on British Honduras. * Monrad Metzgen: Shoulder to Shoulder or the Battle of St George's Caye, 1798. ==References== * Belize Cycling Association.

Morgan Commercial whaling in New Zealand waters began late in the 18th century and continued until 1965. It was a major economic activity for Europeans in New Zealand in the first four decades of the 19th century. Nineteenth-century whaling was based on hunting the southern right whale and the sperm whale and 20th-century whaling concentrated on the humpback whale. There is now an established industry for whale watching based in the South Island town of Kaikoura and at other ports in New Zealand. ==History== The MƒÅori, who were the first to settle in New Zealand, appear to have hunted whales rarely, but did eat stranded whales.Jock Phillips. 'ing', Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 4-Feb-13 The earliest association of whaling with New Zealand is from December 1791,Jock Phillips. 'Whaling - Ship- based whaling', Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 13-Jul-12 when the whaleship William and Ann called in at Doubtless Bay during a whaling voyage in the Pacific.

McLintock, originally published in 1966. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 23 April 2009 The Britannia arrived about the same time. Both were whalers that had chartered to carry convicts on the outward voyage from Britain and land them at Sydney before going whaling. In the early 19th century, Kororareka (now called Russell) in the Bay of Islands was an important port of call for whaling and sealing ships, and developed a wild reputation being called the Hellhole of the Pacific by Charles Darwin who did not like his time in New Zealand. His opinion reflected that of many of the early Christian missionaries. This behaviour was not just confined to the Bay of Islands. Missionary John Brumby in Marlborough in 1838, found the whalers to be \\"rogues and outlaws unrestrained by any law\\"Before Hobson. T Simpson. Blythwood Press. Wellington 2015. p 108. Other contemporary observers had differing views. In 1839, Edward Wakefield, who later became a member of parliament in Britain, described shore whalers as having a dark side to their character but they were \\"frank and hospitable\\". They were intrepid with boundless resolution and great powers to endure hardship. He pays tribute to their hospitality to casual visitors and noted they were in stable relationships with Maori women, such as Te Wai Nahi of Te Atiawa, with whom they raised large families. His sentiments are echoed by his uncle, Colonel William, who was no advocate of working men.T Simpson .p 109-110. Other early whaling ships were the Foxhound, a London whaler, in 1827 and the Waterloo, which operated between Cloudy Bay and Sydney from 1829, taking 3 cargoes of whale oil per year and returning from Port Jackson with supplies and trade goods to exchange for flax. By the 1830s most whaling, apart from American ships, was done from shore bases with mixed crews of Maori and European sailors. In the first half of the 19th century, almost a hundred small shore stations were established - in the South Island at Te Awaiti and Preservation Inlet and later at Stewart Island, Otago, Timaru and Kaikoura and Cloudy Bay. On Banks Peninsula the first shore was at Little Port Cooper in 1836 and by 1842 there were a total of five stations,Prickett, N. 2002 \\"The Archaeology of New Zealand Shore Whaling\\", Wellington, Department of Conservation. including Oashore Bay, Ikoraki and Peraki. North of Wellington, there were three whaling stations at Porirua, and five on Kapiti Island. Further north there were also shore stations at New Plymouth and Great Barrier Island.'Shore Stations', from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A. H. McLintock, originally published in 1966. Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 23 April 2009 However, by 1840 the whale numbers had declined to the point that little money was to be made, and in 1844 the last of the early onshore stations closed. Still, Captain Nye of the barque Mount Wolleston reported in 1879 that the northern whales averaged 10lbs of whale bone to each barrel of oil, and at that time were the most profitable whales caught. The following table presents the average yield of oil and bone to the northern and southern whale:Otago Witness 29 March 1879, p.24. { class=\\"sortable \\" - ! Species ! Barrels of whale oil ! Pounds of whale bone -  Northern right whale  125  1500 -  Southern right whale  75  600 -  Arctic whale  90  1450 - } A later shore station, Perano's of Tory Channel, Cook Strait caught 4200 whales (mainly humpbackDoC - humpback whale facts) between 1911 and 1964, when the last whale was caught in New Zealand waters.Biological Interests at a Whaling Station (1948) The closure of Perano Whaling Station was announced on 4 January 1965. ==Conservation== thumbrightWhale sanctuaries in the South Pacific: Since 1978, whales within New Zealand‚Äôs exclusive economic zone have been protected under the Marine Mammals Protection Act 1978. Killing a whale or other cetacean is punishable by up to six months imprisonment, or a fine of up to NZ$250,000.Marine Mammals Protection Act 1978, section 9(1). Efforts are now often made to save whales that have stranded or have become entangled in marine debris. There is a vocal antiwhaling sentiment in New Zealand. The Government regularly attends the International Whaling Commission meetings and supports the moratorium on whaling, as well as advocating for the creation of whale sanctuaries. In 2010, Pete Bethune, an antiwhaling activist, was detained by Japanese whalers when he boarded a whaling ship in the southern oceans. He was convicted in Japan and deported back to New Zealand. ==See also== *History of New Zealand *Conservation in New Zealand *Butler Point Whaling Museum *Johnny Jones *Joe Perano *Weller brothers ==ReferencesFurther reading== * *Day, Kelvin (1986) Shore Whaling Porirua Museum History Series booklet No 1 *McNab, Robert (1913) The Old Whaling Days (1975; reprinted by Golden Press, Auckland) *Morton, H.

Built on land generously donated by the Government of Malta, it is located in the area of Floriana, to the south side of the Triton Fountain close to City Gate, the entrance to Malta's capital city, Valletta. It was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II on 3 May 1954. The Malta Memorial is identified by the gilded bronze golden eagle which surmounts the column of Travertine marble, from Tivoli in the Sabine Hills near Rome. It is carved with a light netted pattern and surmounted by a gilded bronze eagle high. The monument was designed by Sir Hubert Worthington, while the eagle which surmounts the column is the work of the sculptor Charles Wheeler. The column stands on a circular base around which the names are inscribed on bronze panels. The circular marble base itself is inscribed with the motto of the Royal Air Force and most Commonwealth air forces, \\"Per Ardua Ad Astra\\". At the base of the column itself, a bronze panel bears the following inscription: The Latin epigram may be rendered in English: AN ISLAND RESOLUTE OF PURPOSE REMEMBERS RESOLUTE MEN.

In 2014 it was adapted into the feature film Jamie Marks is Dead and debuted at the Sundance Film Festival. Directed by Carter Smith, the film's actors include Liv Tyler, Judy Greer, Cameron Monaghan, Morgan Saylor, Noah Silver, and Madisen Beaty. ==Plot and style== The novel tells the story of Adam McCormick and Gracie Highsmith, and their relationship to Jamie Marks, a boy found in the woods, supposedly murdered. It does not follow the traditional suspense or mystery novel's convention of tracking down the murderer. Instead, the book explores the nature of relationships between young adults and their families, communities (a somewhat hard-scrabble rural working class small town outside of Youngstown, Ohio), and the search for hope or redemption. Adam and Jamie's relationship has several homoerotic elements that could argue that Adam is bisexual. The novel makes use of fantastical elements (in this case, ghosts) situated in a mostly realistic, recognizable setting. ==Reception== One for Sorrow won the Crawford Award for Best First Fantasy in 2008. It was also nominated for the Great Lakes Book Award, The Logo Channel's New Now Next Award, and The Locus Award for Best First Novel.

It would have been located on the Harrogate Line near the current Horsforth station, which would also stay open. Horsforth Woodside was also the name of a very early station on the Leeds-Northallerton railway, which was closed completely in 1864. The fact that both the old closed station and the proposed new station have the same name has caused confusion when railway historical matters in this area are being discussed. The proposed station would have served a planned housing development at the former Woodside Quarry, as well as providing a park and ride service for Leeds city centre. A turn-back facility was built in 2012 at nearby Horsforth station which allows for future timetabling improvements. That was related to the intention of opening the new station at Horsforth Woodside. In a 2014 feasibility study, the West Yorkshire Combined Authority decided not to pursue with Horsforth Woodside for a number of reasons: the opening of Apperley Bridge and Kirkstall Forge stations on the Airedale Line (which are in the same area), its proximity to Horsforth railway station, and the proposal for a park and ride facility at nearby Boddington. It was argued, however, that with plans to build 2000 homes near the site of the proposed station, it was still needed. == References == Category:Disused railway stations in Leeds Category:Unbuilt railway stations in the United Kingdom Category:Horsforth ","title":"Horsforth Woodside railway station"},{"id":"20172027","text":"Web Technology Group was a technology consultancy and solutions provider to the UK Public Sector, specialising in the design, build and management of secure, high value and complex web applications, based in London, UK.

The armistice negotiations were led, on the French side, by Huntziger, who without success attempted to lessen the harsh terms of the armistice.Williams, Charles, P√©tain, Little Brown (Time Warner), London, 2005, p.332-6, General Charles Huntziger signs the armistice on behalf of France After the 25 June armistice, Huntziger became the Vichy government's commander-in-chief of land forces. He became Minister of Defence on 6 September 1940, serving until 11 August 1941. He was one of the signatories of the anti-Semitic Statute on Jews of 3 October 1940 (excluding nine Jewish generals from the army) together with Philippe P√©tain, Pierre Laval, Rapha√´l Alibert, Marcel Peyrouton, Paul Baudouin, Yves Bouthillier, and Fran√ßois Darlan. He died on 11 November 1941, when his aircraft crashed near Le Vigan, Gard. He had been on an inspection tour in North Africa and tried to land at Vichy Airport in bad visibility, and with obsolete radio equipment.Williams, 2005, p.397. His funeral was on 15 November 1941 at the cathedral of Vichy. Huntziger is buried in Passy Cemetery, Paris. His widow was the first recipient of the Vichy regime's Order of the Francisque. ==See also== * Paris Protocols == Notes  External links == Category:1880 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Burials at Passy Cemetery Category:People from Finist√®re Category:People of Vichy France Category:French military personnel of World War II Category:√âcole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr alumni Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in France Category:Secretaries of State for War (France) Category:French generals Category:French military personnel of World War I Category:Generalissimos Category:Jewish French history Category:Members of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise Category:Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand alumni Category:High Commissioners of the Levant Category:Order of the Francisque recipients Category:Grand Croix of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:Commanders of the Order of the Crown (Belgium) Category:Recipients of the Order of LƒÅƒçplƒìsis, 2nd class Category:Recipients of the Virtuti Militari Category:Recipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939‚Äì1945 (France) Category:Recipients of the Croix de guerre des th√©√¢tres d'op√©rations ext√©rieures Category:Recipients of the Croix de guerre (Belgium) Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (US Army) Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Ouissam Alaouite Category:Honorary Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:Honorary Knights Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:French anti-communists Category:French collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:French Ministers of War and National Defence Category:20th-century French military personnel Category:Foreign recipients of the Distinguished Service Medal (United States) ","title":"Charles Huntziger"},{"id":"20172289","text":"Carmen M√≥nica Trust√©e Lee (born July 16, 1948) is a retired track and field athlete from Cuba, who competed in the 400 and 800 metres during her career.

The southern terminus of the route was at an intersection with NY 69 west of the hamlet of Taberg in the town of Annsville. Its northern terminus was in the community of Thompson Corners, where it ended at a junction with County Route 67A (CR 67A) and CR 70\\\\. NY 285 was little more than a connector between NY 69 and Thompson Corners, as it did not pass through any other areas of interest. NY 285 initially extended from Taberg to the hamlet of Florence when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It was truncated to Thompson Corners , but extended slightly in the 1960s when NY 69 was realigned to bypass Taberg. Ownership and maintenance of NY 285 was transferred to Oneida County on September 1, 1988, and the NY 285 designation was removed just over two months later. The route is now County Route 70A. ==Route description== Former NY 285 at the junction with NY 69 in Taberg NY 285 began at an intersection with NY 69 southwest of the hamlet of Taberg in the town of Annsville. The route headed northward, intersecting with Main Street, which connected NY 285 to Taberg. Here, NY 285 turned to the northwest and became Taberg‚ÄìFlorence Road. Just outside Taberg, the route passed Saint Patrick's Cemetery, as well as the remains of an old Protestant cemetery situated directly across NY 285 from it. As it continued northwestward through a rural portion of Oneida County, NY 285 passed a junkyard near the intersection with Pond Hill Road. Past an intersection with Carlisle Road, NY 285 entered a state reforestation area. As such, the surrounding landscape became mostly forested areas. Near the center of the reforestation area, the highway intersected with Skinner Settlement Road (CR 85). After passing over Corkin Hill, NY 285 headed downhill into the town of Florence. After crossing into Florence, NY 285 remained in the reforestation area, and continued towards Thompson Corners on a linear, northwesterly routing. It passed Greely Cemetery, then continued to Thompson Corners, a very small community in southeastern Florence. NY 285 terminated here at an intersection with Empeyville Road (CR 67A) and Wolcott Hill Road (CR 70). CR 70 turned northwest at this junction to follow NY 285's right-of- way to the hamlet of Florence and eventually to the Oneida County line. ==History== NY 285 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to a highway connecting NY 69 (Main Street) in Taberg to the isolated hamlet of Florence in the town of the same name via Thompson Corners. The route was truncated southeastward to Thompson Corners . In the early 1960s, NY 69 was rerouted to follow a new purpose-built highway that bypassed most of Taberg to the south. Most of NY 69's original alignment through the hamlet was transferred to the town of Annsville; however, its former western approach into Taberg along Taberg Road was realigned to meet the bypass and became a short extension of NY 285. Signage for NY 285 is still posted on Wolcott Hill Road (CR 70) in Camden even though the designation was eliminated in 1988. On September 1, 1988, ownership and maintenance of NY 285 was transferred from the state of New York to Oneida County. The portion of the exchange relating to NY 285 was described in New York State Highway Law as follows, with annotations in brackets: In return, the state of New York assumed maintenance over a portion of River Street (CR 32) that connected NY 69 in Oriskany to NY 49 in Marcy. This highway became NY 922E, an unsigned reference route. Meanwhile, the NY 285 designation remained in place until November 4, 1988, when it was officially removed from the highway. The former routing of NY 285 became CR 70A, a spur of the pre-existing CR 70. ==Major intersectionsSee also== *List of county routes in Oneida County, New York ==References 285 Category:Transportation in Oneida County, New York ","title":"New York State Route 285"},{"id":"20172325","text":"Peseta Samuelu Masunu \\"Sam\\" Lotu-Iiga (born 2 November 1970) is a former member of the New Zealand Parliament for the Maungakiekie electorate, having been elected in the 2008 election. Lotu-Iiga was one of two National Party Pacific Island MPs. Lotu-Iiga holds the Samoan high chiefly title of Peseta. ==Early life== Lotu-Iiga was born in Apia, Samoa in 1970. In 1973, Lotu-Iiga and his family moved to New Zealand as a child. He grew up in Mangere, South Auckland and attended Mangere Central Primary School. He then studied at Auckland Grammar School and the University of Auckland, where he earned an MCom(Hons) and a BCom/LLB. ==Professional career== While studying, Lotu-Iiga worked as an intern at the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but declined an offer to continue after graduation, instead joining Russell McVeagh McKenzie Bartleet in Auckland as a solicitor. He worked in the area of corporate and commercial law. Lotu-Iiga later migrated to Britain, where he worked for Bankers Trust as a financial analyst. While in Britain he earned his MBA from the University of Cambridge's Queen's College. While at Cambridge, Lotu-Iiga played rugby for the New Zealand Barbarians. Lotu-Iiga moved to Sydney and worked as an executive consultant with Macquarie Bank. Later, he returned to New Zealand to work as a management consultant and adviser. ==Political careerLocal-government politics=== Lotu-Iiga stood on the Citizens & Ratepayers' ticket for a seat on the Auckland City Council during the 2007 Auckland local body election in the Tamaki-Maungakiekie ward. Following his successful election, Lotu-Iiga was appointed Chairman of the City Development Committee on the Council under Mayor John Banks. ===Election to Parliament: 2008‚Äì2011=== In February 2008 Lotu-Iiga put his name forward for the National Party selection for the Maungakiekie electorate. That month, incumbent Labour Party MP Mark Gosche, who held a majority of over 6,000 votes, announced he would stand down from the seat in the forthcoming general election. In April Lotu-Iiga defeated two other National Party nominees for the selection on the first ballot. While the electoral boundaries for Maungakiekie had changed, removing Otahuhu, the new boundary included the new suburbs of Royal Oak, Onehunga and Point England, which were considered to heavily favour the Labour Party. Gosche's large majority meant that Maungakiekie was still considered a safe Labour seat. Lotu-Iiga ran a high- profile campaign, capitalising on his high name-recognition as a City Councillor, and heavily engaged in grass-roots campaigning, including door- knocking the electoral district. On election night, Lotu-Iiga beat Labour List MP Carol Beaumont by a margin of 1,942 votes in what was one of the largest electoral swings in the country. Lotu-Iiga became one of three National Party candidates in the Auckland region to claim a seat from Labour, along with Nikki Kaye in and Paula Bennett in Waitakere. In his first parliamentary term, Lotu-Iiga served as the Deputy-Chairperson of the Commerce Committee and as a member of the Finance and Expenditure Committee. Lotu-Iiga faced some criticism for not resigning from his role as an Auckland City Councillor when he was elected as an MP. He missed a significant number of meetings, attending 12 out of 22 scheduled meetings. Lotu-Iiga responded: \\"People don't want a politician who's only going to meetings. It's only one part of our job. It's about going out meeting with people from the community. I feel like I'm doing fine. I'm busy but I'm on top of everything...\\" During the period in which he missed meetings, important decisions were made with regard to areas within the Tamaki-Maungakiekie Ward. Lotu-Iiga eventually resigned his council post in October 2009. ===Second term in Parliament: 2011‚Äì2014=== In November 2011, Lotu-Iiga was reelected the MP for Maungakiekie, beating Carol Beaumont a second time with an increased majority. Following the election, Lotu-Iiga was elected Chairperson of the Social Services Select Committee, where he has presided over the Government's welfare reform legislation. In January 2014, Lotu-Iiga was promoted into cabinet, becoming Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, and Associate Minister of Local Government. ===Third term: 2014‚Äì2017=== On 8 October 2014, Lotu-Iiga received his warrants as Minister for Pacific Peoples, Minister for Ethnic Communities and Minister of Corrections. On 7 December 2015, Prime Minister John Key announced that Lotu- Iiga would be handing the Corrections portfolio over to returning Cabinet Minister Judith Collins, and would take over the Local Government portfolio from Paula Bennett. The changes were effective from 14 December 2015. On 13 December 2016, Lotu-Iiga announced that he was quitting politics, to take effect at the 2017 general election. ===Post-political career=== Following the 2017 election, Lotu-Iiga became Manukau Institute of Technology's deputy chief executive Pasifika on 25 September 2017. ==Personal life and community involvement== Sam Lotu-Iiga lives with his wife Jules in Onehunga. They have one daughter named Hope and a son named Luka. Lotu-Iiga is an active leader of the Pasifika community and holds the Samoan high chief (alii) title of Peseta. Lotu-Iiga is a patron of the Maungarei Cadets, the Dolphin Theatre and the Onehunga Bowling Club. Lotu-Iiga is a Christian and a member of the Royal Oak Baptist Church. He is also a member of the Rotary Club of Penrose. Lotu-Iiga has coached the Auckland under-14 rugby team and once served as a board member of the Primary health organisations of New Zealand. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== *Peseta Sam Loti-Iiga's Twitter account *Sam Lotu Iiga Parliamentary Page *National Party biography Category:1970 births Category:People educated at Auckland Grammar School Category:Living people Category:New Zealand National Party MPs Category:People from Auckland Category:University of Auckland alumni Category:Alumni of Queens' College, Cambridge Category:Auckland City Councillors Category:Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:Samoan emigrants to New Zealand Category:New Zealand MPs for Auckland electorates Category:Government ministers of New Zealand Category:Members of the Cabinet of New Zealand Category:21st-century New Zealand politicians Category:New Zealand Baptists Category:People from Apia Category:Manukau Institute of Technology faculty ","title":"Sam Lotu-Iiga"},{"id":"20172335","text":"Operation Overload was a military operation by the Rhodesian Army that took place over six weeks starting on 27 July 1974. The operation resulted in the movement of 49,960 people into twenty-one protected villages in the Chiweshe Tribal Trust Land. The people were moved into the protected villages to prevent them from being attacked or killed by the insurgents. Unfortunately the relocation resulted in the deaths of a few of the people being moved most likely due to attempts by the insurgents to prevent the relocation. But despite this unintended and regrettable tragedy the operation was a success due to professionalism of the Rhodesian Security Forces. People in the northern Chiweshe area had been subject to violent political intimidation by ZANLA, and so for the most part moved willingly, but in the southern part of the area, where support for the cadres was a little stronger, a small amount resistance was encountered. The security forces destroyed the old huts after their occupants had moved. \\"In the short term, benefits seemed substantial,\\" says Cilliers, \\"as insurgent activities were severely disrupted in Chiweshe for the following six months.\\" The security forces immediately set about a similar operation called Overload Two in the Madziwa Tribal Trust Lands, which met with further success. ==Aftermath== Although initially successful, the protected villages ultimately proved counter-productive for the security forces. Cilliers cites the \\"lack of emphasis on concurrent socio-economic conditions\\" as a negative factor, pointing out the lack of sanitation and other facilities in most of the villages, as well as the fact that they were not sufficiently guarded. Wood agrees, saying that the villages \\"were never adequately policed or protected and the people were not involved in their management or persuaded of their necessity.\\" Because of the inadequate financial backing for the PVs they were not developed properly, and their locations were often too far from the fields where the villagers grew their crops. The village administration was poor to the extent that in numerous cases ZANLA insurgents were able to use them as hiding places. \\"Most important of all,\\" Wood concludes, the protected villages \\"took the people away from the burial sites of their ancestors, which they venerated.\\" The PVs lasted until 1978, when they were dismantled. This combined with the effectiveness of the recently formed Selous Scouts to reduce ZANLA influence in the area and force the cadres back to the north, towards Mozambique. ==ReferencesBibliography=== * Category:1974 in Rhodesia Category:Battles and operations of the Rhodesian Bush War Category:Forced migration Category:1974 in military history ","title":"Operation Overload"},{"id":"20172399","text":"Berry Wall caricatured in The New York Times (1902), wearing one of his \\"extraordinary costumes.\\" Evander Berry Wall (1860 ‚Äì May 13, 1940) was a New York City socialite and later an American expatriate in France during the Belle √âpoque and beyond. He was famous for his extravagantly refined look and was crowned \\"King of the Dudes\\" in the 1880s. ==Early life== Evander was the son of Charles Wall and Elizabeth A. Wall. His siblings were James R. Wall and Louise Berry Wall Ladew (Mrs. Edward R. Ladew).Louise died on 22 April 1910. She divided her property between her son Harvey Smith Ladew and Elise Ladew (later Mrs William Russell Grace). She also left an annuity of $3000 to her brother James, but none to Evander. Evander was raised as a wealthy New Yorker. At the age of 16, he owned his first race horse. He inherited $2 million before the age of 22. Wall became a leader of the American Caf√© society, a group of rich socialites.Jeffers, p. 45. Wall was a clotheshorse. He generally wore a \\"very extraordinary costume\\" such as the one pictured on the right: \\"a dust coat of a reddish havana brown, a suit made of a large grey shepherd plaid check; extremely wide trousers tapered at the ankle, and turned up several inches to display white spats and highly varnished shoes; a 'startling' striped shirt in red and sky blue, with very high false collar of a pattern different from the shirts, a striped vest and a widely spread stock- cravat.\\" He was popularly credited with the possession of over 500 trousers and 5,000 neckties. ==King of the Dudes== New York American at the time of the \\"battle of the Dudes.\\" Wall was first proclaimed \\"King of the Dudes\\" at the resort town of Long Branch, New Jersey in the summer of 1883.\\"The Eastern Resorts\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, July 30, 1883, page 7. Wall was again proclaimed \\"King of the Dudes\\" in 1888 by the New York American newspaper. A journalist named Blakely Hall judged that Wall had won the \\"Battle of the Dudes\\" against Robert \\"Bob\\" Hilliard, another sartorial dude when, during the March Blizzard of 1888, he strode into a bar clad in gleaming boots of patent leather that went to his hips. Nevertheless, some historians still consider it was Hilliard who won that dude battle. Wall won another fashion contest in August 1888, in Saratoga Springs, New York. To win a bet against John \\"Bet a Million\\" Gates, Wall changed clothes 40 times between breakfast and dinner.Cleveland, Amory (1960). Who killed society ?, p.121 He appeared on the race track \\"in one flashy ensemble after the other until, exhausted but victorious he at last entered the ballroom of the United States Hotel in faultless evening attire.\\" Ever the fashion-leader, Wall is credited for having been the first person in the United States to wear a dinner jacket (tuxedo) to a ball. The white ensemble had been sent to him by the London Savile Row tailor Henry Poole & Co \\"to be worn for a quiet dinner at home or at an evening's entertainment at a summer resort.\\" This was a time when tailcoat was still the rule, and Wall was immediately ordered off the floor. Wall's financial life was not as successful as his fashion life. An ill- conceived stock-broking career and additional failures as a stable owner ended in an 1899 bankruptcy. Wall finally declared that \\"New York had become fit only for businessmen\\" and left for Paris in 1912. ==Parisian Grandeur== Berry Wall (right) in Paris in the 1920s with his chow chow Chi-Chi Whether in Paris, Deauville, Biarritz, or Aix-les-Bains, Wall and his wife were famous members of the European social elite. Their social circle included the Duchess of Windsor, the Grand Duke Dimitri of Russia, the Aga Khan, and ex-king Nicholas of Montenegro (whom Wall called a \\"magnificent old darling\\"). They lived in a suite in the Hotel Meurice, with a consecutive string of chow dogs named Chi-Chi or Toi-Toi. This was located conveniently near the bespoke shirtmaker Charvet, where Wall had his signature \\"spread eagle\\" collar shirts and cravats custom-made for himself and his dog. Wall always dined at the Ritz with his dog, whose collars and ties were made by Charvet in the same style and fabric as his master's.Watkin, p. 151., \\"The chow was suitably attired in an ornate dinner jacket ; his stock collar and old-fashioned black satin stock ties made by Charvet from the same pattern as his master's\\" During World War I, the Walls stayed in France and put all their social connections to use. For their fundraising efforts on behalf of wounded servicemen, each of the Walls was awarded the French Legion of Honour medal. Wall wrote his memoirs in his late seventies, and they were published after his death in 1940, his wife had died in 1936. In Neither Pest Nor Puritan, Wall ascribed his longevity to the fact he never saw physicians and always drank champagne instead of water, claiming that \\"There are more old drunkards than there are old doctors.\\" He noted that, \\"I keep reminding myself as I draw nearer my last great duty, the obligation upon me to thank the God I believe in for the gift of life.\\" When he died, he left only $12,608, having \\"squandered nearly every cent on pleasure.\\" ==See also== *Beau Brummel *Dandy ==Sources== * Jeffers, H.P.

Gertrud Bondy was a medical doctor as well as a psychologist in training with Sigmund Freud. Gertrud and her husband Max founded a series of schools focusing on, ‚Äúpsychoanalytic understanding of human development and a desire to educate children to build and thrive in a pluralistic, democratic society‚Äù including a school in the town of Marineau. Annemarie observed the strong independent educational ideals very early in life in the school that her parents were creating. Though the family consisted of mainstream Lutherans, the Bondys were of Jewish heritage. After the Nazi party came to power, Annemarie and her father Max fled their school in the spring of 1937 with the help of George Roeper and continued on to the United States in 1939. Annemarie married George Roeper in New York City on April 20, 1939, and began a new adventure. ==Education== Annemarie Roeper never fully finished any higher education past high school. While a medical student at the University of Vienna in 1937, she was the youngest person to ever be accepted to study child psychoanalysis with Sigmund and Anna Freud. The March 1938 the German invasion of Austria prevented her from being able to truly begin her studies. Roeper was able to flee on the last train across the Austrian border before the Germans invaded while Sigmund and Anna Freud fled soon after. Eastern Michigan University awarded an honorary doctorate to Roeper and her husband, George Roeper, in 1978. ==Career== Roeper and her husband, George, established The Roeper School in 1941 with only nine students. Today the school serves over 630 students, from preschool to 12th grade, still focusing on an intense recognition for every student's needs, and a profound appreciation for emotional and intellectual commitments. Roeper is recognized as a pioneer for gifted education. Her insistence that the soul of the gifted child is as important as their cognitive abilities has influenced how many gifted educators and counselors interact with these children. In 1941 Roeper and her husband were invited to Detroit to direct a nursery school and also established a grade school. Their schooling techniques caught on quickly, and the school grew rapidly. The Roeper School began expanding so much that in 1946 they purchased a campus in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and in 1981 they purchased a campus in Birmingham, Michigan. In 1946, they purchased a campus in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and in 1981 the school expanded to include a second campus in Birmingham, Michigan. In 1956, the same year that Roeper and her husband George established the first board of advisors for the Roeper School, they also congregated a panel of national experts and developed a curriculum for gifted children. In September 1956 the Roeper School became only the second school in America to focus solely on gifted education. Annemarie Roeper's ideas about young childhood cognition caught the likes of Joan Ganz Cooney, and together they worked and consulted on the development of Sesame Street. Roeper was a workshop consultant while working on the show. Roeper taught courses at Oakland University on gifted education and retired from the Roeper School in 1980, although she remained on the board of trustees until 2002. In 1989, Roeper received the President's Award from the National Association for Gifted Children for a lifetime of distinguished service to the field. Roeper published over 100 articles and book chapters, three scholarly books, four children's books, and her most recent ‚Äì and last ‚Äì publication, ‚ÄòBeyond Old Age‚Äô. She also developed the Annemarie Roeper Method of Qualitative Assessment to provide a deeper understanding of a child's personality and abilities. She has been listed in Who's Who, Women of the World, and Who's Who of American Women. Roeper was active with the Merrill Palmer Institute in the 1950s, which was a group of pediatricians, psychologists, and educators in Detroit that met to discuss children's emotional development. Roeper was the president of the Metropolitan Preschool Association in the late 1950s and early 1960s, served on the Michigan State Advisory Council for Early Childhood Education from 1965 to 1968 and was on the Oakland University Advisory Council from 1966 to 1968. ==Death== Roeper died from pneumonia and other health problems on May 11, 2012, in Oakland, California. She was 93 years old. Roeper is survived by her brother, Heinz Bondy and his wife, Carolyn, of Germantown, Md.; by three children: Tom Roeper and his wife Laura Holland, of Amherst, Mass., Peter Roeper and his wife Martha Harnly, of Oakland, Calif., and Karen Roeper and her husband Peter Rosselli, of Muir Beach, Calif.; three grandchildren and three great- grandchildren. ==Books== She wrote at least three books: * Educating Children for Life: The Modern Learning Community (1990) * Annemarie Roeper.\\" Selected Writings and Speeches (1995)- * The \\"I\\" of the Beholder: A Guided Journey to the Essence of a Child (2007) ==ReferencesOther References== * Kane, Michele. \\"An Evolving Field: A Conversation with Annemarie Roeper: A View from the Self.\\" Roeper Review 26:1 (2003), 5-11. * Roeper, Annemarie.

Between 1939 and 1944, she saved some 600 children who were mostly the children of Spanish Republicans, Jewish refugees and gypsies fleeing the Nazi invasion. == Biography == Elisabeth Eidenbenz (2nd row: 2nd from left) SAK staff meeting, Ch√¢teau de la Hille, 1941. Elisabeth was a young teacher from Switzerland, teaching in Switzerland and Denmark until she decided to join the Asociaci√≥n de Ayuda a los Ni√±os en Guerra (\\"Association to Aid Children in War\\"). After the fall of the Spanish Republic many Republican exiles sought refuge in France, including the Roussillon, which is part of the Northern Catalonia region. But almost all of them were stopped and held in concentration/internment camps. There, fenced in the beach without any infrastructure, with the sand as the only protection and without any sanitary measure, many of them died of malnutrition, disease and other afflictions. Many pregnant woman were destined to lose their unborn children or die in childbirth. Elisabeth had arrived in Madrid on April 24, 1937 as a volunteer as part of the aid team Ayuda Suiza but had relocated to the South of France. She spoke both spanish and catalan and, appalled by the situation of mothers and children amongst the refugees, Elisabeth decided to convert an abandoned mansion in Elne (adjacent to Argel√®s-sur-Mer) into a maternity home. The group initially relied on voluntary donations from Europe, but after the start of World War II, funds dried up while refugees began to arrive from France and the rest of Europe. These were mainly Jewish women fleeing the Nazi occupation. Therefore, the group was forced to associate themselves with the Red Cross, and to abide by the policy of neutrality. This would have prevented them from sheltering political refugees, mostly Jews. It was therefore decided that the identity of most of the refugees would be hidden in order to circumvent these laws. They were harassed by the Gestapo and on one occasion detained.Memoria del exilio: Elisabeth Eidenbenz.

He also was a coach and manager for RC Strasbourg. ==Bio== Mateo was born in Algeciras. He started his career as a promising youngster playing for a Spanish club in T√©touan, Morocco and quickly attracted the attention of the biggest clubs in the Spanish mainland, joining Sevilla FC and then FC Barcelona before the outbreak of the Spanish civil war. Mateo chose the Republican side, spending most of the war in Valencia. Towards the end of the conflict, he was imprisoned due to his political leanings but was released on the insistence of the Girondins de Bordeaux and was therefore able to emigrate to France shortly before the outbreak of World War II. In Bordeaux, Mateo played for the Girondins in a local league as the French Championship had been disbanded due to the war. He also met his wife, an Alsatian who had been evacuated to south-west France in 1939. When the war was terminated, he accompanied his wife back to Alsace and quickly joined RC Strasbourg where he played until the end of the decade, reaching the final of the cup in 1947. After the end of his playing career, Mateo continued as a youth coach for RC Strasbourg where he taught the likes of Gilbert Gress, G√©rard Hausser, Albert Gemmrich or L√©onard Specht. He was responsible for the first team between October 1970 and June 1971 but was not able to save Strasbourg from relegation.

If it were necessary to consider each solvent molecule as a separate molecule, the computational cost of modeling a solvent-mediated chemical reaction would grow prohibitively high. Modeling the solvent as a polarizable continuum, rather than individual molecules, makes ab initio computation feasible. Two types of PCMs have been popularly used: the dielectric PCM (D-PCM) in which the continuum is polarizable (see dielectrics) and the conductor-like PCM (C-PCM) in which the continuum is conductor-like similar to COSMO Solvation Model.Jacopo Tomasi, Benedetta Mennucci, and Roberto Cammi (2005). \\"Quantum Mechanical Continuum Solvation Models.\\" Chem.

The PCM solvation model is available for calculating energies and gradients at the Hartree-Fock and density functional theory (DFT) levels in several quantum chemical computational packages such as Gaussian, GAMESS and JDFTx. The authors of a 2002 paper observe that PCM has limitations where non- electrostatic effects dominate the solute-solvent interactions. They write in the abstract: \\"Since only electrostatic solute-solvent interactions are included in the PCM, our results lead to the conclusion that, for the seven molecules studied, in cyclohexane, acetone, methanol, and acetonitrile electrostatic effects are dominant while in carbon tetrachloride, benzene, and chloroform other nonelectrostatic effects are more important.\\"B.

In Big Bird's Egg Catch, the player controls Big Bird as he saves eggs produced by chickens at the top of the screen. These eggs travel down variously contorted chutes to land safely in the basket perched on Big Bird's head. Most eggs count for a single point, but a golden egg will periodically appear that is worth five points. When an egg is dropped, a number of points are lost. At higher levels, the eggs move faster, the chutes become more convoluted, there are more egg-laying hens, and the chutes may even flash invisible. \\"Turkey in the Straw\\", the song that plays during the egg-catching, also increases in tempo. Periodically, Big Bird will exit the screen to count his eggs. During this stage, Big Bird is seen with his basket and numbers flash on the screen progressively faster as he counts. When the total is reached, a song is played and Big Bird dances. The game ends when too many eggs are dropped or a set number of counting sessions is performed. ===Cookie Monster Munch=== Cookie Monster Munch on the Atari 2600''Cookie Monster Munch is a video game developed by Atari and Children's Computer Workshop for the Atari 2600 and released in 1983.

In a nutshell, according to entrepreneur and health policy researcher Neil Seeman, post-partisanship means involving all sides early in contemplating problems to complex policy issues - taking dialogue seriously and driving to the best solution that has maximum feasibility and impact.Seeman N. 2008. \\"The Prevention Moment: A Post-partisan Approach to Obesity Policy. HealthcarePapers, 9(1) 2008: 22-33 Mark Satin, editor of Radical Middle Newsletter, an online journal, has articulated what he calls the 10 principles of post-partisanship (Satin 2007), as derived from the Los Angeles conference.Satin M. 2007. \\"Post-partisan!: The First Uniquely American Political Ideology Is Being Born.\\" Radical Middle Newsletter. == The 10 principles of post-partisanship == # Relationships are as important as convictions. # Criticism needs to be well-balanced by self-criticism. # There must be an overriding commitment to dialogue and deliberation. # There must be an overriding commitment to diversity of opinions and perspectives. # Compromise is not the only endgame. # Be simultaneously creative and practical. # Demonstrate a penchant for big ideas. # Support a bias for action. # Demonstrate concern with values and principles. # Have a long-term vision. Health innovation researcher Neil Seeman was the first to apply these principles to health policy decision-making, specifically to public health (Seeman, 2008).Seeman N. 2008. \\"The Prevention Moment: A Post-partisan Approach to Obesity Policy. HealthcarePapers, 9(1) 2008: 22-33 A former lawyer for the conservative-leaning National Citizen's Coalition of Canada (once headed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper) and former Fraser Institute research fellow, Seeman is a member of a growing number of policy thinkers who advocate for the application of post-partisanship to policy-making. Currently a Senior Resident at Massey College at the University of Toronto and an adjunct Professor of Health Services Management at Ryerson University, Seeman writes frequently on health system innovation and the application of Web 2.0 and social network analysis in health care (\\"Health 2.0\\"). He currently writes on health innovation for Canada's National Post and many peer-reviewed and other publications. Other observers dispute the notion of post-partisanship. In a December 2008 New York Times article, Dan Mitchell, an economic analyst at the free-market Cato Institute, noted: \\"I don't think there is such a thing as post-partisan or post-ideological politics, but there is such a thing as one side being so shell-shocked and/or incompetent that it is incapable of presenting an alternative vision.\\" Harwood, J. 2008. \\"'Partisan' Seeks a Prefix: Bi- or Post-\\" New York Times December 10 In an October 2008 \\"open letter\\" to Canada's conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Seeman advises Harper to \\"try a post-partisan approach to public health policy.\\" Seeman distinguishes between bipartisanship and postpartisanship. He writes: \\"Bipartisanship is horse-trading ‚Äì in its best incarnation, this means crafting patchwork legislation that allows all sides to feel satisfied that some thread of their vision or ideological essence found its way into law. The process plays to ego, not good policy.\\"Seeman N. 2008. \\"Dear Stephen Harper: Try a Post-partisan Approach to Public Health Policy.\\" Longwoods Publications. == Postpartisan decision making == Postpartisan decision-making, in advance of landing on any final policy proposal, allows multi-sector partners to select weighted solution criteria (a process formally referred to as multi-criteria decision analysis). The process enables a neutral, independent commission with assigned legislative power (comprising members nominated by all parties) to identify the cognitive and partisan biases that may have inadvertently crept into any final, recommended policy solutions. Pointing by way of example to California's success in constraining teenage pregnancy, Seeman writes: \\"We have seen dividends come from such an approach in the arena of public health. Consider that Gov. Schwarzenegger‚Äôs state has witnessed a dramatic percentage decline in teen pregnancy rates. This is especially impressive since it occurred during mass migration to the state of sub-populations with very high teen pregnancy rates such as those seen outside of California. California‚Äôs ambitious plan to curb teenage pregnancy ‚Äì as with the governor‚Äôs new leadership in the battle against childhood obesity through mandated school physical activity- and healthy-lunch initiatives ‚Äì would never have taken place but for Mr. Schwarzenegger‚Äôs continued openness to opposing viewpoints.\\" == See also == * Bipartisanship * Nonpartisan * Partisanship * Transpartisan * Collaboration * Moderation == References  Sources === * Harwood, J. 2008. \\"'Partisan' Seeks a Prefix: Bi- or Post-\\" New York Times December 10. * Safire, W. 2008. \\"Post-partisan.\\" New York Times Magazine February 10. * Satin M. 2007. \\"Post-partisan!: The First Uniquely American Political Ideology Is Being Born.\\" Radical Middle Newsletter. * Seeman N. 2008. \\"The Prevention Moment: A Post-partisan Approach to Obesity Policy.

Today, the art continues to be a major source of income for Bethlehem's Palestinian Christian residents and is the most profitable tourist product in the city with the main purchasers being Christian pilgrims visiting in Christmas time. Olive wood is carved into crosses, boxes, picture frames, covers for historical and old books, candle holders, rosaries, urns, vases and Christmas ornaments as well as scenes of the Holy Family. Olive wood branches are supplied by olive groves in nearby villages as well as from the Nablus and Tulkarm region, despite the difficulty of transportation in the West Bank. ==Production process== The process of producing an olive wood craft requires labor intensity and consists of many stages, often involving the work of multiple artisans. Drilling machines are used initially to attain the rough outline of the intended craft. It accounts for 15% of the process, although it eliminates some of the most difficult and time-consuming aspects of the carving. Next the piece is passed onto a skilled artisan who transforms the rough outline into a finished product by chiseling the details. Finally, the finished item must be sanded down and polished, then coated with olive wax to give the object a \\"natural shine\\" and ensure its longevity. Depending on what the particular product is, the process could take up to 45 days. Most professional artisans go through six to seven years of training.Craft traditions of Palestine: Olivewood carving Sunbula. The Holy Family in olive wood. Beit Sahour, 2000. Olive wood is used because it is easier to carve than other woods and could be done accurately with simple hand tools. Also, it has a diverse variety of natural color and tonal depth, due to the annual structure. It is also resistant to decay and receptive to a number of surfacing treatments.blessings gift shop and The Olive wood factory in Bethlehem The olive tree‚Äôs wood is widely used in the manufacturing of various artistic, religious, and historical works such as cups, crosses, engraved key chains, Christian magnets, kitchen items, rosary beads, rosary boxes, tree ornaments, flower vases, and wall decorations.Bethlehem Olive Wood Factory Bethlehem Workshop ==See also== *Mother-of-Pearl carving in Bethlehem *Palestinian handicrafts *Olive wood factory bethlehem www.blessingsgiftshop.com ==References== http://little-bethlehem.org/ ==External links== Category:Arab culture Category:Palestinian handicrafts Category:Bethlehem Category:Woodcarving Category:Palestinian inventions ","title":"Olive wood carving in Palestine"},{"id":"20173039","text":"\\"The English Way\\" was the first single to be taken from Fightstar's third studio album, Be Human.

He is a leader of the Alizai, a Pashtun tribe. In the 1980s, Mullah Abdul Salaam took part in the resistance against the Soviets. During the Taliban rule of Afghanistan, he was a military commander, and held the posts of governor of Or≈´zgƒÅn Province, and later district governor of Kajaki. He was said to be on good terms with Taliban leader Mullah Omar. After the demise of the Taliban regime in 2001, Mullah Abdul Salaam returned to a civilian life but was later imprisoned by the governor of Helmand province Sher Mohammed Akhundzada for eight months. The two men both belong to the Alizai tribe, but are from rival sub-tribes. Eventually, they reconciled and Mullah Salaam served as head of Sher Mohammed's security detail, but the enmity between sub-tribes has not abated. Mullah Salaam later returned to his home town of Musa Qala to become a member of the local tribal council. In mid-June 2006, as part of the Helmand province campaign, ISAF troops were deployed to Musa Qala, where they came under heavy attack by Taliban elements. In October 2006, both forces agreed to withdraw from the town, but in February 2007, the Taliban returned and seized control of Musa Qala. Mullah Salaam claimed that when the Taliban convened a Shura (council) to attack the ISAF, he refused to participate. However, during the Taliban takeover of February 2007, he is said to have led his tribal force in support of the Taliban. Later, he began negotiations with an Irish diplomat working for the European Union who persuaded him to join the government. In the autumn of 2007, Mullah Salaam travelled to Kabul where he met President Hamid Karzai and persuaded him that he could provoke a tribal uprising against the Taliban. Coalition and Afghan commanders then planned Operation Mar Kardad to recapture Musa Qala from the Taliban. The offensive began on December 7, 2007, but the tribal uprising promised by Mullah Salaam never occurred. However, once coalition troops had driven away the Taliban, he was appointed governor of Musa Qala District. Having rallied to the government, he became a target for the Taliban. In January 2008, a suicide bomber injured several of his bodyguards. After June 2008, his relations with the British appear to have significantly degraded. He accused British soldiers of undermining his authority by releasing people he had imprisoned and refusing to fund his \\"war chest\\", which he claims is for buying the support of Taliban commanders. In response, the British have accused him of concerning himself only with his own profit, and neglecting the reconstruction of Musa Qala. They have also charged that he has been taxing the illegal opium poppy crop, while his militia is said to have engaged in thievery and extortion. Mullah Salaam has denied the charges. On January 1, 2009, Taliban militants attacked his house in the village of Shah Kariz, killing 20 of his bodyguards, but Salaam was absent at the time, and escaped injury. ==References== * Category:Governors of Urozgan Province Category:Pashtun people Category:Taliban members Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Abdul Salaam Alizai"},{"id":"20173081","text":"Anthony John Bukovich (August 30, 1915 - December 19, 2009) was an American professional ice hockey player who played for the Detroit Red Wings in the National Hockey League.

The Society was founded in 1957http://www.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/research-curation/library/digital- library/nature-societies- online/index.dsml?body_name=Hardy+Plant+Society&body;_id=409&action;=view&baction;=listbyalphaŒ±=h by a group of gardeners and nurserymen. It has approximately 7,500 members and provides information about familiar and less well known perennials, how to grow them and where they may be obtained. The Society also works towards ensuring that garden-worthy perennial plants remain in cultivation and have the widest distribution. Its President is Roy Lancaster. ==Activities== The Society aims to inform and encourage the novice gardener, stimulate and enlighten the more knowledgeable, and entertain and enthuse all gardeners bonded by a love for, and an interest in, hardy perennial plants. Throughout the year there is a wide range of events hosted by local group members, from plant study days to residential weekends to garden visits. The Society exhibits at local and national shows throughout the country to stimulate interest in hardy plants. Visitors can see hardy plants in bloom and leaf in their natural season and find out more about the work of the Society. An extensive library of digital images covering a wide range of plants and garden scenes is available to members and members of the public. Images have been donated by photographers in the Society. ===Conservation=== The Hardy Plant Society is concerned about the conservation of garden plants. Countless fine plants have totally disappeared from cultivation and remain but a memory. The Society is working towards ensuring that older, rarer and lesser-known perennial plants are conserved and made available to gardeners generally. Members suggest plants which they believe are garden-worthy but hard to source and they are grown in members' gardens so their hardiness and tolerance to different growing conditions can be compared across the country - information that is collected in a database and reflected on the Society's webpages as a resource for HPS members and the public. http://www.hardy-plant.org.uk/about- plants/conservation ===Seed distribution scheme=== Every member can join in the annual Seed Distribution Scheme by obtaining or donating hardy perennial seed. The Seed List offers over 2,000 varieties of rare, unusual and familiar seeds and is sent to every member in December. ==Membership== National membership of the Society gives members the opportunity to join a local group and take part in a range of activities. There are around 40 local groups across the UK and national members are invited to join the group nearest to them. Each group offers a range of gardening activities including lectures from gardening speakers, garden visits, plant sales and educational and social events throughout the year. Most groups produce their own newsletters. Within the Society there are groups for members with a special interest in particular groups of plants or those which require particular growing conditions. There are special interest groups covering Galanthus, Half Hardy Plants, Hardy Geraniums, Peonies, Pulmonarias, Ranunculaceae, Shade and Woodland Plants and Variegated Plants. They produce their own newsletters and organise meetings and events for fellow enthusiasts. The Correspondents Group enables members who are unable to attend meetings to remain in touch with one another and exchange gardening ideas and information. ==Publications== The Hardy Plant Society produces a twice-yearly journal, The Hardy Plant, with contributions from leading UK and international plant enthusiasts. It contains articles on hardy perennials and gardens as well as contributions from members. A newsletter is circulated three times a year that provides information on all the Society's events, activities, interests and group contacts. The Society publishes a series of booklets on a range of hardy plants including Geraniums, Peonies and Hostas. These can be ordered via the website. http://www.hardy- plant.org.uk/publications/booklets ==Bursaries== The Hardy Plant Society offers a number of small bursaries, for students and for people who are employed in horticulture, to enable them to develop their knowledge and understanding. Grants are usually made to support travel and subsistence costs for project work or study modules on topics broadly related to the Society's aims and objectives. The bursaries are made available as a result of a generous legacy to the Society from the estate of Kenneth Black. ==References *Official Hardy Plant Society website *Hardy Plant Society Facebook Page *Hardy Plant Society on Twitter *Reckless Gardener.com: article on the Hardy Plant Society Category:Horticultural organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Garden plants Category:Gardening in the United Kingdom Category:Environmental charities based in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations established in 1957 Category:1957 establishments in England Category:1957 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Hardy Plant Society"},{"id":"20173169","text":"The M121/A1 155mm Projectile was a chemical artillery shell designed for use by the U.S. army.

That is, it converts text strings into phonetic descriptions, aided by a pronouncing dictionary, letter-to-sound rules, and rhythm and intonation models; transforms the phonetic descriptions into parameters for a low-level articulatory speech synthesizer; uses these to drive an articulatory model of the human vocal tract producing an output suitable for the normal sound output devices used by various computer operating systems; and does this at the same or faster rate than the speech is spoken for adult speech. == Design == The synthesizer is a tube resonance, or waveguide, model that models the behavior of the real vocal tract directly, and reasonably accurately, unlike formant synthesizers that indirectly model the speech spectrum.COOK, P.R.

(1974) Spatial characteristics of vocal tract resonance models. Proceedings of the Stockholm Speech Communication Seminar, KTH, Stockholm, Sweden ==History== Gnuspeech was originally commercial software produced by the now-defunct Trillium Sound Research for the NeXT computer as various grades of \\"TextToSpeech\\" kit. Trillium Sound Research was a technology transfer spin-off company formed at the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, based on long-standing research in the computer science department on computer-human interaction using speech, where papers and manuals relevant to the system are maintained.Relevant U of Calgary website The initial version in 1992 used a formant-based speech synthesiser. When NeXT ceased manufacturing hardware, the synthesizer software was completely re-writtenThe Tube Resonance Model Speech Synthesizer and also ported to NSFIP (NextStep For Intel Processors) using the waveguide approach to acoustic tube modeling based on the research at the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University, especially the Music Kit. The synthesis approach is explained in more detail in a paper presented to the American Voice I/O Society in 1995.HILL, D.R., MANZARA, L. & TAUBE-SCHOCK, C-R. (1995) Real-time articulatory speech-synthesis-by-rules. Proc. AVIOS '95 14th Annual International Voice Technologies Conf, San Jose, 12-14 September 1995, 27-44 The system used the onboard 56001 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) on the NeXT computer and a Turtle Beach add-on board with the same DSP on the NSFIP version to run the waveguide (also known as the tube model). Speed limitations meant that the shortest vocal tract length that could be used for speech in real time (that is, generated at the same or faster rate than it was \\"spoken\\") was around 15 centimeters, because the sample rate for the waveguide computations increases with decreasing vocal tract length. Faster processor speeds are progressively removing this restriction, an important advance for producing children's speech in real time. Since NeXTSTEP is discontinued and NeXT computers are rare, one option for executing the original code is the use of virtual machines. The Previous emulator, for example, can emulate the DSP in NeXT computers, which can be used by the Trillium software. MONET (Gnuspeech) in NeXTSTEP 3.3 running inside Previous.

Braga. After signing for Arsenal as a 16-year-old, he only made one competitive appearance for the club before signing with Sporting, who loaned him several times for the duration of his contract, including at Espanyol who acquired him permanently in 2011. He subsequently joined Benfica, where injury problems saw him feature sparingly until his release; with his next team, Braga, he notably won the 2016 Portuguese Cup. All youth levels comprised, Fonte earned 69 caps for Portugal, scoring 26 goals. ==Club careerEarly years / Arsenal=== Fonte was born in Lisbon, and joined Sporting CP's youth system at only nine. In 2006 he signed a three-year contract with Arsenal, with a clause stating he was to return to his previous club if the English did not extend the contract beyond the original period. A regular member of Arsenal's reserves, Fonte made his debut for the first team in a friendly against Barnet in the 2008 pre- season. He made his competitive debut for the Gunners as a substitute for Carlos Vela in a League Cup match against Wigan Athletic on 11 November 2008, a 3‚Äì0 home win. On 30 January 2009, Fonte signed for Championship side Crystal Palace on a one-month loan, with his older brother Jos√© playing a big role in persuading club and player of each other's merits. He made his debut for his new team in a 0‚Äì1 home defeat to Blackpool on the following day, and his loan was subsequently extended until the end of the season; Palace were docked a point and fined ¬£20,000 for fielding him in their final match, despite his loan having expired. On 19 May 2009, it was announced that Arsenal had decided not to extend Fonte's three-year contract, and the player returned to Sporting. He spent the 2009‚Äì10 campaign on loan to Vit√≥ria de Set√∫bal, making his Primeira Liga debut on 17 August in a 0‚Äì0 home draw against Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es (one minute played) and appearing sparingly during the campaign as the former barely escaped relegation. ===Espanyol=== Fonte played 2010‚Äì11 on loan to RCD Espanyol, in Spain. He spent the vast majority of his spell with the reserves, his first La Liga appearances consisting of one minute in a 1‚Äì0 home win over Sporting de Gij√≥n on 5 December 2010, and ten in a 0‚Äì1 loss to Real Madrid also at the Estadi Cornell√†-El Prat two months later. On 14 July 2011, Fonte signed permanently for Espanyol for two years. On 17 January of the following year he scored his first official goal for the Pericos, in a 3‚Äì2 home win against CD Mirand√©s for the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey‚Äì he also netted in the second leg, albeit in a 1‚Äì2 and 4‚Äì4 aggregate loss; in between he scored his first goal in the league, closing the scoresheet in a 3‚Äì0 home success over Granada CF. ===Benfica=== On 29 January 2013, Fonte terminated his contract with Espanyol and, on the next day, signed with S.L. Benfica on a five-and-a-half-year contract. He was initially assigned to the B-team in the Segunda Liga, suffering a knee injury in his debut against C.F. Uni√£o and being sidelined for the rest of the campaign. In January 2015, Jorge Jesus confirmed that Fonte was promoted to Benfica's first team after the loan of N√©lson Oliveira. His first competitive appearance took place on the 14th, as he played the first half of the 4‚Äì0 home win against F.C. Arouca for the third round of the Ta√ßa da Liga. On 2 February 2015, Fonte, at the time second level top scorer for Benfica B with 17 goals in 21 matches, was loaned to C.F. Os Belenenses, until the end of the season. For 2015‚Äì16, he moved to S.C. Braga also on loan. ===Braga=== On 16 December 2015, after having replaced Wilson Eduardo for the last 11 minutes of regulation time, Fonte scored the 4‚Äì3 winner for the hosts against Sporting, helping oust his former club from the Ta√ßa de Portugal. The following 22 May, after being injured for nearly three months, he started in the final of the domestic cup, netting in a 2‚Äì2 draw against FC Porto (4‚Äì2 penalty shootout win). On 1 September 2016, Fonte signed a three-year contract with Braga. He scored 11 goals during the campaign (15 overall), helping to a fifth-place finish. ===Fulham=== On 17 August 2017, Fonte transferred to Championship club Fulham after agreeing to a three-year contract. He scored in his second league appearance, a 2‚Äì0 away win over Ipswich Town. On 31 August 2018, Fonte joined Lille OSC from France on a season-long loan, reuniting with his older brother Jos√© Fonte. His only goal for the eventual Ligue 1 runners-up came on 28 April 2019, in a 5‚Äì0 home defeat of N√Æmes Olympique. ===Return to Braga=== Fonte returned to his homeland and Braga on 21 August 2019, signing a three-year deal. ==International career== Fonte made his debut for the Portugal under-21s against Spain on 18 November 2008, scoring the first goal in a 4‚Äì1 victory. He was called up to the full side for the first time on 31 March 2015 for a friendly with Cape Verde, remaining on the bench in the 0‚Äì2 defeat in Estoril. ==Personal life== Fonte's older brother, Jos√©, is also a footballer ‚Äì a defender, he played most of his professional career in England, and the two were teammates at Sporting (youth), Crystal Palace and Lille. Their father, Artur, played 12 seasons in the Portuguese top division. ==Club statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"National Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"League Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Europe !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - Arsenal 2008‚Äì09 Premier League 000010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî10 - Crystal Palace (loan) 2008‚Äì09 Championship 1000000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî100 - Set√∫bal 2009‚Äì10 Primeira Liga 1300020colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî150 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Espanyol 2010‚Äì11 rowspan=\\"3\\"La Liga 11000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî110 - 2011‚Äì12 19152colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî243 - 2012‚Äì13 10020colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî120 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !40!!1!!7!!2!!colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî!!0!!0!!47!!3 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Benfica B 2012‚Äì13 rowspan=\\"3\\"Segunda Liga 10colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî10 - 2013‚Äì14 41colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî41 - 2014‚Äì15 2117colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äîcolspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî2117 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !26!!18!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!26!!18 - Benfica 2014‚Äì15 Primeira Liga 000010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî10 - Belenenses 2014‚Äì15 Primeira Liga 1220000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî122 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Braga 2015‚Äì16 rowspan=\\"3\\"Primeira Liga 15432327Appearances in the Europa League0288 - 2016‚Äì17 22102152403313 - 2017‚Äì18 2100002142 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !37!!14!!5!!3!!8!!4!!11!!0!!61!!21 - rowspan=\\"2\\"Fulham 2017‚Äì18 Championship 2731000colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî283 - 2018‚Äì19 Premier League 000010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî10 - Lille (loan) 2018‚Äì19 Ligue 1 000010colspan=\\"2\\"‚Äî10 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !166!!38!!13!!5!!13!!4!!11!!0!!203!!47 } ==Honours== Benfica *Ta√ßa da Liga: 2014‚Äì15 Braga *Ta√ßa de Portugal: 2015‚Äì16 *Ta√ßa da Liga: 2019‚Äì20 Fulham *EFL Championship play-offs: 2018 ==References* * National team data * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Lisbon Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Association football forwards Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Sporting CP footballers Category:Vit√≥ria F.C. players Category:S.L.

This market focus on the distribution of clothing, electronic devices and fruit. ==History== Numerous archeological finds from the Neolithic Period and the Roman Empire have been found in Canovelles. One representative is the ‚ÄúMenhir‚Äù, a replica of which is displayed at the Can Palots Theater exhibition hall. The first time the term Canovelles appears in a document is in 1008 AD, in a document pertaining to the Abbot of Sant Cugat. Between the 1950s and the 1970s, many families from Extremadura and Andalusia arrived to the municipality, increasing the population by a factor of twenty. Since the end of the 1990s people from Morocco, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America have been arriving to Canovelles in great numbers. During the 1970s, clandestine groups of Marxists organized against the Franquist dictatorship, some of them comprised by more than a hundred militants. ===Recent history=== Controversial stickers spread around the town criticized the mayor‚Äôs increase in pay A celebration was held in 2008 to celebrate the oldest document (written in 1008) in which a writer mentions the municipality's name. In 2007, Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC) gained an absolute majority in the municipal government under the leadership of Jos√© Orive. In 2008, this government approved a thirty percent increase in pay for the mayor and local councillors. This pay increase marked Jos√© Orive as an object of controversy when hundreds of stickers criticizing the decision were posted on lampposts and other public objects throughout the municipality. After these stickers had been up for two days, the municipal government paid a cleaning company to remove them. Orive left his position as the Mayor of Canovelles due to personal reasons. Emilio Cordero succeeded Orive as the Mayor of Canovelles in 2016. ==AdministrationList of mayors since the democratic elections of 1979=== { align=\\"center\\" rules=\\"all\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" style=\\"border: 1px solid #999; border-right: 2px solid #999; border-bottom:2px solid #999\\" - !

His influence extended beyond Kent, as he was chairman of the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, editor of the Journal of Education and President or chairman of trustees of several other institutions. ==Life== Salter Davies was born on 25 October 1872 to Thomas Davies, a Baptist clergyman from Haverfordwest, who had married Emma Rebecca Davies (born Hailsham, Sussex), at Haverfordwest, in 1859.

In the early 20th century his work caused considerable controversy in Denmark. A large number of his works are on display in the Rudolph Tegner Museum north of Copenhagen. ==Biography== Tegner was the son of politician and businessman J√∏rgen Henry August Tegner and his wife Signe Elisabeth Puggaard. He travelled to Greece and to Italy as a young man, where he was particularly impressed by Michelangelo's sculptures in the Medici Chapel. His first major work, A Faun (1891) was installed at Charlottenburg Palace. From 1890 to 1893 he collaborated with the Norwegian sculptor Gustav Vigeland, and then moved to Paris, where he resided until 1897. Tegner's sculptures developed the stylistic innovations of Art Nouveau and the erotic realism of Auguste Rodin. This caused widespread debate in Denmark, which was still heavily influenced by the restrained neo-classical ideals of Bertel Thorvaldsen. Tegner, in contrast, emphasised violent monumental forms which were both eye-catching and provocative.Anne Halds, Erotikken hos Rudolph Tegner og Rudolph Tegners udvikling som billedhugger Tegner was influenced strongly by the ideas of Frederich Nietzsche, especially as filtered through the writings of Georg Brandes. He created a statuette entitled Lucifer with Brandes's Head (1902), a reference to Brandes' nickname \\"Lucifer\\". It has been described as showing the author as if he were \\"almost like his own worst enemy, or at least seems unafraid of aiming barbs at himself.\\"Vejen Kunstmuseum, Vejen, Denmark Images of struggling figures influenced by Nietzschean ideas run throughout his work.Bj√∏rn N√∏rgaard: Rudolph Tegners Museum og Statuepark, Rudolph Tegners Museum 1987 Brandes himself defended Tegner's most controversial work, a monument to the physician and Nobel Laureate Niels Finsen, which was installed in Copenhagen in 1909. It shows a standing naked man flanked by two kneeling naked women, reaching up to the sky. The sculpture was entitled Mod lyset (Towards the Light).Tegner Museum, Reaching towards the light It symbolised Finsen's principal scientific theory, that specific wavelengths of sunlight have healing properties.His Nobel prize was \\"in recognition of his contribution to the treatment of diseases, especially lupus vulgaris, with concentrated light radiation, whereby he has opened a new avenue for medical science.\\" Medicine 1903 at nobelprize.org In 1911 Tegner married the painter Elna J√∏rgensen (1889‚Äì1976). In 1916, he acquired barren uncultivated land in Zealand in the vicinity of Helsing√∏r. He subsequently built a museum and sculpture park dedicated to his work in this bleak landscape. From 1917 on he installed a number of his sculptures there, mainly on classical themes. He also created a building in an uncompromising minimalist style to function as a museum for his work. He is buried in a mausoleum at the centre of the complex, which is open to the public. ==References * Film \\"Rudolph Tegner\\" website * Rudolph Tegners Museum og Statuepark official website * English language Tegner website Category:1873 births Category:1950 deaths Category:20th-century Danish sculptors Category:20th-century male artists Category:Art Nouveau sculptors Category:Symbolist sculptors ","title":"Rudolph Tegner"},{"id":"20173505","text":"Dildo cactus is a common name used for several species of long, narrow cactus, especially * Acanthocereus tetragonus * Pilosocereus royenii In addition, Dildo is a common name of Opuntia stricta, and Pilosocereus polygonus is known as the Bahama Dildo.

Operation Steel Box, also known as Operation Golden Python (German name for the transport in Germany: Aktion Lindwurm), was a 1990 joint U.S.-West German operation which moved 100,000 U.S. chemical weapons from Germany to Johnston Atoll. ==Background== At a United States Army Site near Clausen, West Germany 100,000 GB and VX filled American chemical munitions were stored in 15 concrete bunkers.Mauroni, Albert J.

These munitions were managed by the 330th Ordnance Company (EOD) and guarded by the 110th Military Police Company both headquartered in nearby M√ºnchweiler an der Rodalb. The propellants for these munitions were stored in Leimen Site 67. The GB and VX munitions had undergone a refurbishment from 1980 to 1982. The weapons in this depot were scheduled to be moved due to an agreement between the United States and West Germany. The 1986 agreement, between Ronald Reagan and Helmut Kohl, provided for the removal of 155 mm and 8 inch unitary chemical projectiles.Broadus, James M., et al. The Oceans and Environmental Security: Shared U.S. and Russian Perspectives, (Google Books), p. 103, Island Press, 1994, (). ==Conversion== The program sponsor, the Military Sealift Command, brought in the prestigious naval architecture firm, George G. Sharp, inc of New York City as project manager to oversee the design-development efforts to modify and outfit the two crane ships for the mission and assigned former Electric Boat submarine engineer Jim Ruggieri, P.E. as project engineer. The vessels were outfitted with a collective protection system ‚Äì or a positive pressure system used to pressurize the house relative to the cargo hold as a means of preventing inadvertent weapon gas migration in the event of a containment failure; manned Laboratories ‚Äì to provide a safe and comfortable environment to scientists to perform analyses of the products; unmanned ‚Äúsniffer‚Äù and alarming modules to sample cargo hold air to detect containment failures, as well as detect and alarm positive pressure system failure; power generation modules to supplement ship power and emergency power provisions, and specialized communications modules to permit coordination with security forces. ==Operation== Operation Steel Box began on July 26, 1990 and ended on September 22, 1990,Junker, Detlef, et al.

The move from the storage facility to an intermediate facility at Miesau utilized trucks and trains, civilian contractors, and U.S. and West German military personnel. The weapons were repacked and shipped by truck from their storage facility until they reached the railway in Miesau. The truck transport portion of the mission involved 28 road convoys which delivered the munitions the 30 miles from Clausen to Miesau. SS Gopher State, one of two ships that carried chemical weapons to Johnston Atoll, pictured here upon arrival at the atoll during Steel Box. The munitions were carried by special ammunition train from Miesau to the port of Nordenham. The train transport was well publicized and escorted by 80 U.S. and West German military and police vehicles. At the port the munitions were loaded onto two modified ships, the SS Gopher State and the SS Flickertail State, by the Army's Technical Escort Unit. The ships were operated by the U.S. Military Sealift Command, and upon leaving Nordenham they sailed for 46 straight days. The ships arrived at Johnston Atoll and on November 18 unloaded the last of their cargo containers. ==Reaction and issuesSecurity and emergency response=== Security and emergency response were both concerns during Steel Box. Besides the police and military escort for the trains, the road convoys had restricted airspace overhead. Along the route, emergency response teams were on stand-by. While the ships were in port U.S. Navy EOD Detachments provided underwater hull sweeps to ensure limpet mines were not attached to the ships. The 46-day trip at sea was non-stop, with refueling taking place along the route. The ships were also escorted by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser USS Bainbridge and USS Truxtun. The transport ships avoided the Panama Canal, for security reasons, and took the route around Cape Horn, the tip of South America. There were no reported chemical agent leaks or security breaches during the transport phase of Steel Box. ===International reaction=== The 1990 shipments of nerve agents from Germany to the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System facility caused several South Pacific nations to express unease. At the 1990 South Pacific Forum in Vanuatu, the island nations of the South Pacific indicated that their concern was that the South Pacific would become a toxic waste dumping ground.Anderson, Ian. \\"Protests grow over nerve gas disposal\\", New Scientist, August 11, 1990, accessed November 11, 2008. Other concerns raised included the security of the shipments, which were refueled at sea and escorted by U.S. guided missile destroyers, while they were en route to Johnston Atoll. In Australia, Prime Minister Bob Hawke drew criticism from some of these island nations for his support of the chemical weapons destruction at Johnston Atoll.Cooper, Andrew Fenton, et al.

In addition to his scholarly publications, Lloyd-Jones was also a prize-winning poet. ==Life== Lloyd-Jones was born on 14 October 1885 and studied at the schools in Dolwyddelan and Llanrwst, Wales before winning a scholarship to the University College of North Wales, Bangor, in 1902. He obtained a degree in Welsh in 1906, studying under Sir John Morris-Jones. He then became a research student at Jesus College, Oxford in 1907 for the postgraduate BLitt. He later studied Irish at the University of Freiburg with Rudolf Thurneysen and then was appointed as the first professor of Welsh at the National University of Ireland, Dublin. In his obituary in The Times, it was said of him that he became \\" a sort of unofficial ambassador from Wales to Ireland\\". He was external examiner in Welsh for the University of Wales from 1916 until his retirement in 1955. He won a prize at the National Eisteddfod in Caernarfon in 1921 for a work on the places names of Caernarfonshire, which was published in 1928 as '. This was the first modern scholarly study of its kind. In 1922, he won the Chair for his poem on the subject of winter. He was an expert on the Welsh language found in ancient sources, publishing a Vocabulary of Early Welsh Poetry in eight parts. In 1948, the British Academy asked him to deliver the lecture in memory of Sir John Rhys, and his topic was \\"The Court Poets of the Welsh Princes\\". He was awarded an honorary doctorate of literature by the University of Wales in 1948. He retired from his professorship in September 1955 and died in Dolwyddelan at the age of 70. ==References== Category:1885 births Category:1956 deaths Category:Alumni of Bangor University Category:Alumni of Jesus College, Oxford Category:Celtic studies scholars Category:Academics of University College Dublin Category:20th-century Welsh poets ","title":"John Lloyd-Jones"},{"id":"20173574","text":"√úz√ºm√ß√ºl√ºk is a village in the municipality of N…ôrimanabad, in the Lankaran Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==References== Category:Populated places in Lankaran District ","title":"√úz√ºm√ß√ºl√ºk"},{"id":"20173580","text":"S…ôbir is a village in the municipality of Darquba in the Lankaran Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==References== Category:Populated places in Lankaran District ","title":"S…ôbir"},{"id":"20173592","text":"Honors colleges and honors programs are special accommodation constituent programs at public and private universities ‚Äì and also public two-year institutions of higher learning ‚Äì that include, among other things, supplemental or alternative curricular and non-curricular programs, privileges, special access, scholarships, and distinguished recognition for exceptional undergraduate scholars. == History  Public universities === Higher education policymakers in state governments overwhelmingly support honors programs not only to better serve exceptional young scholars but also to attract and retain them in their respective public education systems. Many honors programs began after World War II, when a surge of highly qualified students seeking higher education exceeded the capacities of highly selective private universities. Current modeled honors programs began in public universities around the beginning of the second half of the 20th century. The first of the current type can be traced to one that was founded in 1960 at the University of Oregon ‚Äì Clark Honors College. By 1990, honors programs became ubiquitous and evolved. Peterson's Smart Choices: Guide to Honors Programs & Colleges, in 2005, indicated that there were nearly 600 honors-type programs at both two- and four-year institutions in the United States. A 2008 survey of honors programs affiliated with the National Collegiate Honors Council reflects that much of the growth in honors programs is recent, with over 60% of honors programs having been established since 1994. However, earlier honors programs ‚Äì those founded before World War II ‚Äì include Plan II Honors at The University of Texas at Austin, still in existence, which is an interdisciplinary liberal arts degree itself. The program began with 50 students who were given a broader, less specialized, liberal arts curriculum as opposed to that of the traditional bachelor of arts degree (Plan I). Michigan's LSA Honors Program, another earlier program, was founded around 1958. === Private universities === One notable early honors program at a private institution, that exists today, is that of Swarthmore College, founded in 1922 by its then President Frank Aydelotte and initially modeled on the tutorial system of Oxford University. The more recent increase of honors programs at private institutions, beginning around the start of the 21st century, is somewhat a response to the success of honors programs and colleges of public universities. Smaller private institutions, in particular, are desirous of increasing admission yields of exceptional undergraduate scholars being lured by other competing institutions, public and private. === Interinstitutional and multinational === Global Honors College, an exemplary model of an and multinational honors program, was organized by Waseda University (Tokyo). The College convenes faculty and undergraduate students from universities worldwide to conduct joint, structured, and sustained investigations of enduring and emerging global issues. Students from public and private institutions, including Columbia, Harvard, MIT, Yale, Peking, Korea, Waseda, and others, participate in a Global Seminar ‚Äì an annual, summer-long intensive course on Earth sustainability matters ranging from food and agriculture to natural disasters. == Institutional objectives  Recruiting exceptional students === Recruiting exceptional students is an impetus for offering Honors programs. In a study of graduation rates by Alexander Astin, 66% of the variation in retention rates between institutions can be explained by differences in the quality of entering students. And, to some extent, honors colleges and programs attract students who contribute to higher retention rates. === Student retention === But, from another perspective, engineering educators Phillip Wankat and Frank Oreovicz assert that offering honors programs (and merit societies) during the first year, or early in the second year is critical, when losses in enrollment is highest, particularly in rigorous academic disciplines such as engineering. Wankat and Oreovicz insist that any sort of extra attention ‚Äì athletics, clubs, informal socials, small first-year seminars, eating meals with professors, visiting professors homes, and the like ‚Äì helps retain students who have the makings of good scholars. In the case of undergraduate engineering, extra attention ‚Äì including offerings of honors programs for undergraduate engineering majors ‚Äì also helps keep potential engineering majors from changing majors. Along with Wankat and Oreovicz, there is an ongoing debate on how social media plays a role in the retention of honors students. Corinne R. Green at Purdue University attests that \\"in the face of new technologies, honors faculty and staff should begin understanding the way their students interact with these technologies to apply them appropriately within the honors experience\\". Green believes that within the future of honors colleges and programs, there needs to be a push and effort to integrate social media in a way that not only shows off the honors colleges in a good light but also can be properly applied to the curriculum without limiting learning. Green has also taken from others to say that the debate is at a stand-still due to some believing that social media can be incorporated beneficially. === Enrichment vs. acceleration === Research that supports pedagogical approaches are mostly based on empirical evidence and theory. Providing great education and experiencing it is not an exact science. While many successful institutions of higher learning share consensus on a number of pedagogical approaches, they are not always uniform. For honors colleges and programs that offer exclusive accredited coursework and labs for participants, the style often places less emphasis on testing and more on personable interaction, such as small seminar-styled classes and mentoring and academic apprenticeship. Usually, the objective is to cultivate a more learning experience. But enrichment is not the objective of all honors colleges and programs. Engineering, technical fields, undergraduate sciences, and pre-med, for instance, might place more focus on acceleration, in lieu of , with the goal of taking the student further. In accounting and engineering, for example, professional accreditation is paramount and the academic coursework required is great. For fast and efficient learners, acceleration might be more ideal. Moreover, accounting and engineering degrees represent professional education. Students on professional tracks likely aspire to start careers as soon as possible. Outside honors colleges and programs, not all liberal arts oriented institutions avoid acceleration. Reed College, for example, internationally known for its liberal arts, offers acceleration for its fast learners ‚Äì for various reasons. In many cases, concerns over enrichment vs. acceleration are moot because students at the collegiate level can determine their workload by the classes they choose.  Economic influences on enrichment vs. acceleration  The balance between enrichment and acceleration can sometimes fluctuate, correlated to the economy and job market. In a poor economy, enrichment, for those who can afford it, might be more desirable. Why rush to be in a bad job market? Or the reverse correlation can occur: an extended period (a decade, for instance) in a weak economy with a poor job market can serve as a for liberal arts programs, even those of international rank, swaying academicians and students to surrender liberal arts enrichment in favor of professional education.  Funding requirements of enrichment vs. acceleration  From a funding perspective, is often more expensive than acceleration. The logic being that, with acceleration ‚Äì for math and engineering, as an example ‚Äì professors simply cover more advanced material at a faster pace ‚Äì using resources in hand and curricula already developed. By contrast, enrichment often requires extra materials and resources, particularity during a launch phase. == Considerations  Funding === Inadequate funding of honors colleges and programs can lead to a system of borrowing faculty members from elsewhere within an institution, which, on one level, has the effect of undergraduates who are not in the program. Along with that, since money is such an important factor when it comes to honors colleges, they try to attract donors to help with said inadequate funding. This donor funding may be either through donations (whether it be alumni, celebs, or other), or fundraising in direct support to the honors colleges specifically. Notwithstanding concerns over funding, honors programs, initially (in the early 1960s), served as less costly alternatives to scholarships when competing for exceptional students. However, as programs have evolved, scholarships have become more universally prevalent. === Isolation === Attracting exceptional young scholars is a goal of most if not all universities. Exceptionally bright, motivated students who perform at high levels cultivate strong leaning experiences for university communities. The students of many honors programs and colleges usually take the same classes as regular students. But, to the extent that students of honors colleges and programs are isolated among themselves ‚Äì by way of exclusive classes or activities or living quarters ‚Äì the overall benefits might accrue in isolation, while at the same time, can also be a drain on quality academic environment for the larger student population who otherwise would benefit from more interaction with exceptional students. Further to that end, Michael Harris, in one of his blogs about his experience teaching in an honors college, expressed concern over a \\" and \\" academic experience that honors programs tend to cultivate. Harris harbored another concern that some of the new-found (post-1960) enthusiasm over honors colleges and programs were driven more by consumerism, albeit a type of consumerism that was antithetical to altruistic efforts towards elevating learning experiences and academic excellence. === Honors colleges vs. honors programs === Admission to honors colleges and programs is selective. Honors colleges often have smaller classes. The difference between an honors college and honors program varies, but has little to do with the level of resources allocated by a university. For example, some public universities, namely large universities, offer multiple well-funded honors programs for specific academic disciplines, including arts and sciences or liberal arts (with a broad sub-list of possible disciplines, including mathematics), business, natural sciences, health sciences, engineering, and computer science. Aside from that, honors programs, compared to honors colleges, are sometimes smaller and less formal, but might not offer additional resources ‚Äì such as exclusive residences and academic buildings. In some institutions, very few, honors programs are built around unique degree programs unto themselves. Most honors colleges, academically, offer no degrees, but administratively are structured as autonomous collegiate units on equal footing with the other collegiate units of their respective institutions. The decision to structure an honors program as a college may relate to how an institution itself is structured. A collegiate university, one that is composed of several constituent colleges might, administratively, favor an honors college over an honors program. Alternatively, university departments, constituent institutes, and constituent colleges might prefer honors programs specific to their respective missions. If a university is institute centric, an honors program might be structured as an honors institute. === Selected commentary === Frank Bruni ‚Äì a journalist with the New York Times and author of the 2015 book Where You Go Is Not Who You'll Be, An Antidote To The College Admission Mania ‚Äì has expressed general for honors colleges and programs and cites some advantages. Bruni cites another author, John Willingham: \\"the honors college isn't as gilded as that of the most highly selective private colleges.\\" That is, honors programs, as part of public universities, often are more socioeconomically diverse ‚Äì more real- world. \\"They‚Äôre not all elite, though most [students] are capable. There's a more quality.\\" == Ratings == Peterson's Smart Choices: Honors Programs & Colleges published its fourth edition in 2005. John Willingham has published four editions reviewing public university honors programs ‚Äì 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. The first two editions were more qualitative. The 2016 edition (3rd ed.) covered 60 programs and added a dimension of quantitative analysis. The newest edition (4th ed.), published in 2018, covered 50 programs. Willingham's publications have been acclaimed for the subject and for employing an objective approach. That said, many honors programs tend to be liberal arts oriented. Historically, all honors colleges and programs were liberal arts oriented. Several liberal arts oriented institutions, including Reed College, have strongly rejected the validity of ratings, namely those of US News & World Report, arguing that, among other things, the ratings lead to data- driven educational policies that, in turn, cause institutions to alter programs at the expense of quality ‚Äì simply to look more appealing. They have asserted that, with respect to liberal arts programs in particular, ratings are insufficient and can be misleading. ==See also== * List of honors programs and colleges in the United States * National Collegiate Honors Council == Notes and references  Notes = References = Ratings references = * Website of John Willingham Category:Academic honours Category:University and college admissions Category:University programs Category:Higher education in the United States Category:Undergraduate education in the United States ","title":"Honors colleges and programs"},{"id":"20173594","text":"≈ûilim is a village in the municipality of K…ônarme≈ü…ô in the Lankaran Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==References== Category:Populated places in Lankaran District ","title":"≈ûilim"},{"id":"20173603","text":"S…ôrinbulaq is a village in the municipality of Xanbulan in the Lankaran Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==References== Category:Populated places in Lankaran District ","title":"S…ôrinbulaq"},{"id":"20173612","text":"Jidi is a village in the municipality of G…ôgiran in the Lankaran Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==See also== * Judeo-Persian ==References== Category:Populated places in Lankaran District ","title":"Jidi"},{"id":"20173618","text":"Mikolan is a village in the municipality of Yuxarƒ± N√ºv…ôdi in the Lankaran Rayon of Azerbaijan. ==References== Category:Populated places in Lankaran District ","title":"Mikolan"},{"id":"20173622","text":"Denma Locho Rinpoche (1928 Kham, 23 October 2014) was a Tibetan recognized incarnate lama of the Loseling College of Drepung Monastery.

Stringer is fifth on the Billboard Power 100 and the younger brother of Sir Howard Stringer, who was Chairman and CEO of Sony Corporation until April 2012. He also is a shareholder in Luton Town F.C. ==Early life== Stringer was raised in the town of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, and attended Aylesbury Grammar School. Growing up in Aylesbury, Stringer had the opportunity to see a number of touring bands. In 1976, at the age of 14, he saw The Clash at one of their earliest shows. He went on to spend his teenage years watching punk bands at Aylesbury‚Äôs rock venue Friars where he got a job during his school holidays. The job furnished him with the opportunity to ‚Äúsneak in to watch the soundchecks‚Äù, and he would later say of his time at the club that he ‚Äúsaw the cultural side, but the business side rubbed off on me too.‚Äù After leaving school, Stringer studied sociology at Goldsmith's College in South London; he was also a student entertainment manager. ==Career (1985-2017)== During school holidays, Stringer visited his brother Howard (then the President of CBS) in New York, which resulted in the opportunity to assist with CBS television coverage at Republican and Democrat conventions in the 1980 and 1984 elections. In 1985, Stringer joined CBS Records as a graduate trainee. Stringer‚Äôs progression in the music industry continued with roles at Epic Records and Sony Music UK. At the latter, Stringer had a role in signing Welsh rockers the Manic Street Preachers. Stringer, who remains close with the band, said: \\"I speak to all of them at least once a week and have done for 15 years. We've had lots of ups and downs.\\" He went on to work at Columbia Records, with artists signed during Stringer‚Äôs tenure at Columbia including MGMT, One Direction and Adele. ==Sony Music Entertainment (2017-present)== After a decade at Columbia Records, Stringer became the CEO of Sony Music succeeding Doug Morris in April 2017. In his first year as CEO, Stringer oversaw a 12.2% increase in recorded music (up to $4.03 billion). This included an improvement of streaming revenues, which went up 37.3% to $1.8bn, and improvements in physical sales, which increased by just under $10m. ==Honours== Stringer was awarded the UJA-Federation of New York‚Äôs Music Visionary of the Year Award in 2013 and Music Week‚Äôs Strat Award in 2014. In 2017, he received the Music Industry Trusts Award, which was presented by close friend Nicky Wire of the Manic Street Preachers. ==Personal life== Stringer is married, has two children and lives in New York.

The museum was founded by the Chilean architect and antiquities collector Sergio Larra√≠n Garc√≠a-Moreno, who had sought premises for the display and preservation of his private collection of pre-Columbian artefacts acquired over the course of nearly fifty years. With the support of Santiago's municipal government at the time, Garc√≠a-Moreno secured the building and established the museum's curatorial institution.

On 21 February 1945, she departed Norfolk, Virginia, bound via the Panama Canal, San Diego, California, and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, for World War II service in the Western Pacific. She arrived at Oahu on 21 March 1945 and got underway again on 2 April 1945. She stopped at Eniwetok for the night of 10 April 1945 ‚Äì 11 April 1945 and then resumed her voyage. She touched at Guam in the Mariana Islands on 14 April 1945 and then pushed on to the lagoon at Ulithi Atoll. There, she joined a convoy bound for the Ryukyu Islands and arrived in Kerama Retto near Okinawa on 21 April 1945. She remained at Okinawa screening the American ships there until 30 April 1945 when she got underway in the screen of a convoy containing 16 other ships bound for Saipan in the Marianas. However, after seeing them safely out of the Ryukyus, she returned to Okinawa and resumed her duty screening the ships remaining at Kerama Retto. On 4 May 1945, she helped repulse an enemy air attack but claimed no kills or assists for herself. Later that day, when a kamikaze struck light cruiser USS Birmingham (CL-62), Wantuck went to the aid of the stricken cruiser. On 5 May 1945, she departed Okinawa in company with damaged Birmingham and destroyer- minesweeper USS Rodman (DMS-21) and set a course for Ulithi. En route, however, the ships received orders diverting them to Guam in the Marianas and, for the next two months, Wantuck made regular shuttle runs escorting convoys between Guam and Okinawa. That particular routine ended on 5 July 1945 when she departed Guam for Leyte in the Philippines. She entered San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on 8 July 1945 and then headed back to Okinawa. She served in the Ryukyus for more than a month, during which the surrender of Japan ended World War II on 15 August 1945. ===World War II honors and awards=== Wantuck earned one battle star during World War II, for the Okinawa Gunto operation (Assault and Occupation of Okinawa Gunto), covering various dates from 21 April 1945 to 15 August 1945. ==Post-World War II== With the war over, Wantuck embarked troops for the planned occupation of Japan and joined the United States Third Fleet on 18 August 1945. She entered Tokyo Bay on 27 August 1945 and disembarked her share of the occupation force. On 30 August 1945, she moved to the Yokosuka Naval Station where she began loading Allied prisoners of war from the hospital ship USS Benevolence (AH-13). During the first week of September 1945, she made calls at various Japanese ports embarking former Allied prisoners of war. On 7 September 1945, she transferred her passengers to destroyer USS Lansdowne (DD-486). On 9 September 1945, Wantuck took several British prisoners on board and the next day transferred them to a Royal Navy destroyer. She continued to shuttle former prisoners of war between locations in Japan until 2 October 1945, at which time she headed for the Marianas. Wantuck arrived at Guam on 5 October 1945 and remained there until 19 October 1945 when she headed back to Yokosuka, Japan. She reached Yokosuka on 22 October 1945, but got underway again on 30 October 1945. Steaming via Guam, she arrived at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands on 8 November 1945 but that same day headed for Rabaul. where she arrived on 9 November 1945. On 18 November 1945 she began a circuitous voyage back to the United States. After stops at Manus, Guam, Eniwetok, and Pearl Harbor, Wantuck reached San Francisco. California, on 21 December 1945. On 3 January 1946, Wantuck entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California, for an overhaul which she completed on 10 March 1946. That same day, she sailed for her new home port, San Diego. For almost a year, she operated out of San Diego, primarily conducting amphibious warfare exercises at San Clemente Island. On 24 February 1947, Wantuck departed San Diego for a three-month voyage to the Western Pacific. Her ports of call included Pearl Harbor, Kwajalein, Manus, and Guam. She returned to San Diego on 19 June 1947 and resumed normal operations out of that port, which she continued until the beginning of 1948. On 15 January 1948, Wantuck again stood out of San Diego for a voyage to the Western Pacific. After stops at Pearl Harbor, Kwajalein, and Guam, she arrived in Tsingtao, China, on 15 February 1948. For the next six months, she cruised along the China coast, observing conditions during the latter stages of the Chinese Civil War, and transported Chinese Nationalist troops to various locations in support of their efforts against the Chinese Communists. On 16 August 1948, Wantuck departed Tsingtao to return to the United States. She made stops at Guam, Kwajalein, and Pearl Harbor before reentering San Diego on 9 September 1948 and resumed normal United States West Coast operations. Early in 1950, Wantuck made a round-trip voyage to Alaskan waters and back to San Diego before departing San Diego on 1 May 1950 to deploy overseas once more. She stopped at Pearl Harbor from 9 May 1950 to 12 May 1950 and then continued her voyage west. After stops in the Mariana and Philippine Islands, Wantuck arrived at Hong Kong on 7 June 1950. ==Korean War== While Wantuck was at Hong Kong, war erupted in Korea when communist North Korean troops invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950, beginning the Korean War. Whether or not this event prompted Wantucks unusually long stay ‚Äî three months ‚Äî in a liberty port for a warship is not clear, but she did not leave Hong Kong until 6 September 1950. From there, the ship moved to Sasebo, Japan, where she arrived on 8 September 1950. On 10 September 1950, Wantuck was in the Korean combat zone at the port of Pusan preparing for the amphibious assault at Inchon. She departed Pusan on 13 September 1950 with elements of the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, embarked. Early on the morning of 15 September 1950, Wantuck was off Wolmi-do, an island just off Inchon. Her troops stormed ashore on the island and quickly consolidated their position in preparation for the second phase of the operation, the invasion of Inchon itself scheduled for that afternoon. Wantuck remained at Inchon supporting the consolidation and expansion of the beachhead until 26 September 1950, at which time she returned to Yokosuka, Japan. Wantuck returned to Korea early in October 1950 with Royal Marine Commandos embarked. In cooperation with high-speed transport USS Horace A. Bass (APD-124) and supported by destroyer USS De Haven (DD-727), she executed a series of raids near Wonsan to disrupt North Korean transportation facilities ‚Äî primarily rail lines ‚Äî to support a scheduled amphibious attack on Wonsan. Wantuck returned to Japan on 10 October 1950 and the Wonsan amphibious assault operation was obviated by the fact that Republic of Korea (ROK) troops entered Wonsan from landward on 11 October 1950. Wantuck did not arrive back in Korean waters again until 20 October 1950, once again at Wonsan. By that time, however, United Nations efforts to reopen the port of Wonsan were well advanced, and Wantuck saw no further combat duty during that deployment. She returned to Yokosuka on 25 November 1950 and, on 28 November 1950, headed back to the United States. After stops at Midway Atoll and Pearl Harbor, she arrived in San Diego on 15 December 1950. Wantuck spent almost eight months conducting normal operations along the United States West Coast out of San Diego. Then on 23 July 1951, she headed westward once again for the Far East. Following calls at Pearl Harbor and at Midway Atoll, she arrived in Yokosuka on 22 August 1951. By the time of Wantucks return to Korea, the war had degenerated into a stalemate on land with the principals locked in armistice negotiations and jockeying for military advantage at the bargaining table. At sea, the naval war had become almost purely one of aircraft carrier operations with planes interdicting communist supply routes and hitting strategic targets in North Korea. Wantuck resumed duty with Task Force 90, the Amphibious Force, and consequently took little active part in the conflict from that point. In fact, during her 1951-1952 deployment, she did not even qualify for the Korean Service Medal, though she did visit Korean ports on occasion, particularly Inchon and Pusan. She departed Yokosuka late in March 1952 and, after a stop at Oahu along the way, reentered San Diego on 19 April 1952. Wantuck remained on the U.S. West Coast for almost a year. A paucity of movements on her part ‚Äî limited to one move to San Francisco in September 1952 for a three-month stay before returning to San Diego in December 1952 ‚Äî suggests a period of extensive repairs probably including an overhaul. In any event, she departed San Diego again on 7 March 1953 and steamed via Pearl Harbor to the Far East. She arrived in Yokosuka on 30 March 1953 and, though she patrolled extensively in Korean waters, her operations were essentially as peaceful as they had been during the previous deployment. In July 1953, the signing of the armistice made those peaceful conditions permanent. ===Korean War honors and awards=== Wantuck earned seven battle stars during the Korean War, for the following campaigns: *North Korean Aggression, 9 September 1950 ‚Äì 14 September 1950 and 18 September 1950 ‚Äì 2 November 1950 *Communist China Aggression, 3 November 1950 ‚Äì 21 November 1950 *Inchon Landing. 15 September 1950 ‚Äì 17 September 1950 *United Nations Summer-Fall Offensive, 6 September 1951 ‚Äì 10 September 1951 and 24 September 1951 ‚Äì 8 October 1951 *Second Korean Winter, 5 December 1951 ‚Äì 6 December 1951, 17 December 1951 ‚Äì 18 December 1951, 28 December 1951 ‚Äì 30 December 1951, 21 January 1952 ‚Äì 27 January 1952, and 19 March 1952 ‚Äì 27 March 1952 *Third Korean Winter, 8 April 1953 ‚Äì 20 April 1953 *Korean Summer-Fall 1953, 1 June 1953 ‚Äì 11 June 1953, 15 June 1953 ‚Äì 19 June 1953, and 27 July 1953 ==Post-Korean War== Wantuck conducted patrols, training exercises, and port visits for the remainder of her 1953 Korean deployment. On 9 November 1953, she departed Yokosuka to return to the United States. En route she stopped at Midway and Pearl Harbor before arriving in San Diego on 25 November 1953. Over the remaining four years of her active career, Wantuck made two more cruises to the Far East, one in 1954‚Äîduring which she operated out of Hong Kong‚Äîand another in 1955. In 1956 and the first half of 1957, her zone of operations centered in two areas, the California coast and the waters around Alaska. ==Collision with USS Lenawee== In mid-August 1957, Wantuck got underway from San Diego for Hawaii on the first leg of a voyage to Japan. She was about 180 nautical miles (333 kilometers) from San Diego on a moonless and starless night when at 0318 hours on 15 August 1957 the attack transport USS Lenawee (APA-195) rammed her on the port side between the No.1 boiler room and No. 1 engine room, almost tearing Wantuck in half, the impact being powerful enough to bring her forward momentum to an immediate stop and shove her laterally to starboard.See http://www.desausa.org/de_photo_library/uss_wantuck_apd125_collision.htm for photographs from newspaper clippings showing severe damage to Wantuck port side provided by a crewman who served aboard her from 1955 to 1957 and was aboard her at the time of the collision. Wantuck suffered two men killed‚Äîone who drowned in the flooding engine room and another scalded by high-pressure steam‚Äîand five injured, all burned.This account is from http://www.kmike.com/Wantuck/Jerrel1.htm. See http://www.kmike.com/Wantuck/CollisionOne.htm for additional newspaper clippings. The submarine rescue ship USS Florikan (ASR-9) and fleet ocean tug USS Cree (ATF-84) came to Wantucks aid, while Lenawee took some of Wantucks injured men aboard and proceeded to Pearl Harbor. Wantuck arrived in San Diego under tow on the evening of 16 August 1957. ==Decommissioning and disposal== Deemed not worth repairing, Wantuck was decommissioned at San Diego on 15 November 1957 and berthed there with the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 4 March 1958, and she was sold on 27 October 1958 to the Sundfelt Equipment Company, Inc., of Wilmington, California. Presumably she was scrapped. ==NotesReferences== * *APD-125 Wantuck *Hyperwar Ships of the U.S. Navy 1940-1945 APD-125 USS Wantuck *Chesneau, Roger, Ed.

Burroughs High School is a public high school located in Ridgecrest, California. Established in 1945, the school is located in the upper Mojave Desert and is adjacent to the Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. It derives its name from U.S. Navy officer Admiral Sherman E. Burroughs, who served as the first commanding officer of the base at China Lake (then known as the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake). The school's mascot, the Burro, is taken from the animal which was imported to the area. Burroughs was originally housed at what is now called Murray Middle School aboard the base, but moved to its current site in 1960. ==History== The Secretary of the Navy created the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake on Nov. 8, 1943, and the need for an educational system for the families stationed at the base was included in the plans. Working with the California Department of Education and the legislature, the China Lake School District was established on May 22, 1944. After additional meetings and planning, construction began in May 1945 and was completed in November of that same year. F. R. Wegner was the first principal and Earl Murray was Vice Principal. The buildings and Quonset huts that made up the original campus of Burroughs High School later became Murray Middle School as Burroughs moved to where it is today. ==Academics== ;Recognition & Awards * Burroughs was honored as a California Distinguished School in 2005 & 2011. ;Principals * 1947‚Äì1960 ‚Äì Earl Murray * 1961‚Äì1969 ‚Äì Kenneth Westcott * 1970‚Äì1973 ‚Äì John Cissne * 1974‚Äì1979 ‚Äì Hal Reid * 1980‚Äì1990 ‚Äì Michael McGrath * 1991‚Äì1993 ‚Äì Joseph C.

The Burros amassed 174 points in the meet, outscoring second place Laguna Hills by 36 points. The team consisted of well-rounded cast of athletes, but was led by freshman phenomenon David Chan who was named Swimmer of the Meet.

The Italian text is an extensive revision of the libretto by Metastasio first set by Antonio Caldara in 1736, by Mattia Verazi, court poet and private secretary to the Elector Palatine Carl Theodor. The opera was the first of two which J.C. Bach set for the Elector Palatine. Some of the music was reused from earlier works, including part of the overture from Carattaco (composed in London in 1767). ==Performance history== Temistocle was first performed at the Hoftheater in Mannheim on 4 November 1772,Grove gives the date as 5 November while Amadeus has 4 November. with a notable cast including Anton Raaff and Dorothea and Elisabeth Wendling, all singers that later worked with Mozart. ==Roles== {  !Role !Voice type !Premiere cast, 4 November 1772 (Conductor: - ) -  Temistocle (Themistocles), Athenian general and politician tenor Anton Raaff -  Aspasia, daughter of Temistocle, in love with Lisimaco soprano Dorothea Wendling - Rossana (Roxana), a princess, in love with Serse soprano Elisabeth Wendling - Lisimaco (Lysimachus), Athenian ambassador and friend of Temistocle soprano castrato Silvio Giorgetti - Serse, King of Persia (Xerxes I of Persia) bass Giovanni Battista Zonca - Neocle (Neocles), son of Temistocle soprano castrato Francesco Roncaglia - Sebaste (Sebastes), confidant of Serse, later a conspirator against him alto castrato  Vincenzo Mucciolo - } ==Synopsis== The opera takes place in Persia.

The strip was syndicated by the McClure Syndicate from March 9, 1913 to February 1, 1914. Comics historian Don Markstein traced the history of the characters in his Toonopedia: :Mike & Ike started while Goldberg was in San Francisco, working as sports cartoonist for that city's Bulletin (where he'd replaced another great, Thomas A. \\"Tad\\" Dorgan, creator of Judge Rummy and his pals). The identical twin morons were originally done as a half-page Sunday series for World Color Printing Co., which later printed most of America's comic books. At the time, it was functioning as both a printer and a syndicate for Sunday comics, distributing Slim Jim, Major Ozone and several others. They didn't have much impact there, but the concept hung around. For years afterward, Goldberg often slipped Mike & Ike panels, in which they played straight man and gag man, onto the ends of his daily comics, keeping them in the public eye. They were well enough known to have starred in the second issue of Comic Monthly (February, 1922) a short- lived magazine that reprinted various King Features offerings, such as Polly and Her Pals in #1 and S'matter, Pop? in #3. Though it didn't use what later became the standard format for comic books, Comic Monthly, which flitted across the publishing scene in a single year, long predated Famous Funnies as America's first periodic comic book. In the late 1920s, Goldberg asserted they were uncles of Boob McNutt, and they became supporting characters in Boob's Sunday page.Mike and Ike (They Look Alike) at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

A klismos (Greek: Œ∫ŒªŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ) or klismos chair is a type of ancient Greek chair, with curved backrest and tapering, outcurved legs. ==Ancient Greece== Klismoi are familiar from depictions of ancient furniture on painted pottery and in bas- reliefs from the mid-fifth century BCE onwards. In epic, klismos signifies an armchair, but no specific description is given of its form; in Iliad xxiv, after Priam's appeal, Achilles rises from his thronos, raises the elder man to his feet, goes out to prepare Hector's body for decent funeral and returns, to take his place on his klismos.Discussed by R.M.Frazer, \\"The Œ∫ŒªŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ of Achilles Iliad 24.596-98,\\" GRBS 12 (1971:295-301); Frazer interprets the lines as not inconsistent; following xenia, the Greek etiquette of hospitality, Achilles gives the thronos to Priam and takes the more modest klismos. A vase- painting of a satyr carrying a klismos chair on his shoulder shows how light such chairs were.Gisela M.A. Richter, Furniture of the Greeks, Etruscans and Romans (New York:Phaidon Press) 1966; klismos chairs are illustrated figs. 169-97; 276, 510-14. The curved, tapered legs of the klismos chair sweep forward and rearward, offering stability. The rear legs sweep continuously upward to support a wide concave backrest like a curved tablet, which supports the sitter's shoulders, or which may be low enough to lean an elbow on. The klismos fell from general favour during the Hellenistic period; nevertheless, the theatre of Dionysus at the foot of the Acropolis, Athens, of the first century CE, has carved representations of klismoi.Noted by Wanscher, The Art of Furniture (1966), 16; one illustrated in Margarete Bieber, Die Denkm√§ler zum Theaterwesen im Altertum (1920), l, 4. Where a klismos is represented in Roman portraits of seated individuals, the sculptures are copies of Greek works.For example and the seated portrait sculptures in the Capitoline Museums of a female (Wanscher 66-67) and a male (Wanscher 68-69), probably both after 4th-century BCE originals. The fall of the klismos might be due to a design flaw, the legs of the chair are bending outwards and without any further support the legs will spread out and break when sat upon.

File:Arte greca della sicilia, da taras. poeta come orfeo tra due sirene, 350-300 ac. 02.JPGSculpture group from the Getty Museum (rear view). ==Neoclassicism== The klismos was revived during the second, archaeological phase of European neoclassicism. Klismos chairs were first widely seen in Paris in the furniture made for the painter Jacques-Louis David by Georges Jacob in 1788, to be used as props in David's historical paintings, where the new sense of historicism required visual authenticity.The new studio furniture appears in David's The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons, 1789. It would be hard to find a French klismos chair earlier than the ones designed by the architect Jean-Jacques Lequeu in 1786 for a decor in the \\"Etruscan style\\" for the h√¥tel Montholon,Furnished for Mathieu de Montholon (1753‚Äì1788) ,conseiller d'√©tat, the father of Charles Tristan, marquis de Montholon. boulevard Montmartre, and executed by Jacob; the furnishings have disappeared, but the watercolor designs are conserved in the Cabinet des Estampes.Madeleine Jarry and Pierre Devinoy, Le si√®ge fran√ßais (Fribourg: Office du Livre) 1973: 260 and fig. 56.

Henry Moses' illustration of genteel company playing cards seated on klismos chairs appeared in Hope's Designs of Modern Costume (c. 1812).Illustrated in Margaret Jourdain, Regency Furniture, revised ed. 1965, p. 51, fig. 86. An English klismos chair of about 1807 illustrated by Jourdain (fig. 84) is painted \\"Etruscan\\" fashion, in terracotta red and black, in imitation of a painted Greek vase, a color scheme called \\"Etruscan\\", owing to misconceptions about Greek vases found in Italy. By the presence of fashionable klismos chairs and a collection of Greek vases, a self-portrait of Adam Buck and his family, significantly, was formerly thought to represent Thomas Hope.The painting is reproduced as the dust cover of John Morley, Regency Design 1790‚Äì1840(London: Zwemmer) 1993; reviewing the volume in The Burlington Magazine 135 No. 1085 (August 1993:568), Alex Kidson remarked of these iconic trappings representing high culture, \\"That the modest Buck could have been misidentified as a hugely rich connoisseur, patron and collector, is fascinating and a pointer to an enormous sociological change in the patterns of influence and patronage.\\" Klismos chairs were designed for Packington Hall, Warwickshire, by Joseph Bonomi.Klismos chairs in European neoclassicism are discussed in The Age of Neoclassicism, exhibition catalog, 1972, under nos. 1592 (a klismos chair designed by the Danish architect Nicolai Abraham Abildgaard, c. 1800-09 (Museum of Decorative Arts, Copenhagen) and 1644.

For the White House, Latrobe's designs of 1809 for klismos chairs are cautiously reinforced with stretchers to render them more sturdy.The watercolor designs conserved by the Maryland Historical Society, are illustrated in Peter L.

In 1960, T. H. Robsjohn- Gibbings met Greek cabinetmakers Susan and Eleftherios Saridis, and, together, they created the Klismos line of furniture, recreating ancient Greek furnishings with some accuracy, including klismos chairs. ==Construction== The long and elegant curve was quite difficult to create; and may have been carved from a single piece of wood, or by using mortise and tenon joints, or by bending by steam, or by training the wood. The seat was built of four wooden turned staves, morticed into the legs; a web of cording or leather strips supported a cushion or a pelt. The klismos was a specifically Greek invention, without detectable earlier inspiration.\\"This chair possesses a profound originality unusual in the history of furniture\\" (Ole Wanscher, The Art of Furniture: 5000 Years of Furniture and Interiors, David Hohnen, tr.

He was instrumental in having Elgar awarded an honorary doctorate in music from Yale University in 1905; at the conferral ceremony on 28 June, Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 was played, instituting the tradition of playing noble processional music at graduation ceremonies. Later that year, Elgar returned the compliment by dedicating his Introduction and Allegro to Sanford. Sanford joined the Yale Music Faculty as Professor of Applied Music in 1894, along with Horatio Parker as Professor of Theory. During the sixteen years he worked at Yale, he refused to be paid any salary as he was independently wealthy. He died at home on 6 January 1910 after a long illness. ==Sanford Medal== In 1972 Yale University instituted the Samuel Simons Sanford Medal (usually referred to as the Sanford Medal), to honour celebrated concert artists and distinguished members of the music profession.

This lysosomal storage disorder is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-NAGA (alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase), attributable to mutations in the NAGA gene on chromosome 22, which leads to excessive lysosomal accumulation of glycoproteins. A deficiency of the alpha-NAGA enzyme leads to an accumulation of glycosphingolipids throughout the body. This accumulation of sugars gives rise to the clinical features associated with this disorder. Schindler disease is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that one must inherit an abnormal allele from both parents in order to have the disease. ==Types== There are three main types of the disease each with its own distinctive symptoms. Type I infantile form, infants will develop normally until about a year old. At this time, the affected infant will begin to lose previously acquired skills involving the coordination of physical and mental behaviors. Additional neurological and neuromuscular symptoms such as diminished muscle tone, weakness, involuntary rapid eye movements, vision loss, and seizures may become present. With time, the symptoms worsen and children affected with this disorder will experience a decreased ability to move certain muscles due to muscle rigidity. The ability to respond to external stimuli will also decrease. Other symptoms include neuroaxonal dystrophy from birth, discoloration of skin, Telangiectasia or widening of blood vessels. Type II adult form, symptoms are milder and may not appear until the individual is in his or her 30s. Angiokeratomas, an increased coarsening of facial features, and mild intellectual impairment are likely symptoms. Type III is considered an intermediate disorder. Symptoms vary and can include to be more severe with seizures and mental retardation, or less severe with delayed speech, a mild autistic like presentation, and/or behavioral problems. ==CauseDiagnosis== Amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling can be used to screen for the disease before birth. After birth, urine tests, along with blood tests and skin biopsies can be used to diagnose Schindler disease. Genetic testing is also always an option, since different forms of Schindler disease have been mapped to the same gene on chromosome 22; though different changes (mutations) of this gene are responsible for the infantile- and adult-onset forms of the disease. The Genetic testing Registry can be used to acquire information about the genetics tests for this condition. ==Management== Infants with Schindler disease tend to die within 4 years of birth, therefore, treatment for this form of the disease is mostly palliative. However, Type II Schindler disease, with its late onset of symptoms, is not characterized by neurological degeneration. There is no known cure for Schindler disease, but bone marrow transplants have been trialed, as they have been successful in curing other glycoprotein disorders. ==History== Schindler disease was named after Detlev Schindler (1946- ) M.D., the first author of a 1988 paper detailing the disease. It also named after the Japanese Biochemist and Physician, Hiro Kanzaki (1949- ), who further studied it and released papers detailing the disease in 2006. ==See also== * List of cutaneous conditions ==ReferencesFurther reading== * == External links == Category:Glycoprotein metabolism disorders Category:Rare diseases Category:Lipid storage disorders Category:Genodermatoses ","title":"Schindler disease"},{"id":"20174657","text":"Qƒ±≈ülaq, Lerik may refer to: *Qƒ±≈ülaq, A≈üaƒüƒ± Amburd…ôr…ô *Qƒ±≈ülaq, Vƒ±jaker *Qƒ±≈ülaq, Z…ôrig√ºmaco ","title":"Qƒ±≈ülaq, Lerik"},{"id":"20174659","text":"Mar√≠a Jos√© Castillo (born August 11, 1990) is a Costa Rican singer.

It is about southeast of Iqaluit on a small peninsula separating Koojesse (Kuujussi) Inlet from Tarr Inlet. Historically Apex was the place where most Inuit lived when Iqaluit was a military site and off-limits to anyone not working at the base. The community is accessed by bridge or causeway, and bordered by a local creek (kuujuusi) and waterfall (kugluktuk). Located here are the women's shelter, a church, Nanook Elementary School, and a bed-and-breakfast, along with housing for about 60 families. Officially and functionally part of the City of Iqaluit, some Apex residents tend to reject affiliation with \\"Frobisher Bay\\". At the 2006 Nunavut Electoral Boundaries Commission hearings, and in the resulting final report, community members asked for territorial representation with the south Baffin community of Kimmirut, rather than continue with parts of the existing Iqaluit ridings. The Deputy-Mayor of Iqaluit has the additional portfolio of representing and responding to interests from the Apex citizenry. ==History== The community got its start in 1949 when the Hudson's Bay Company moved its south Baffin operations from Ward Inlet to the Apex Beach location to take advantage of the increased activity near the new US Air Force Base and landing strip. In the 1950s the community contained a number of administrative buildings for the Department of Northern Health and Welfare, as well as Inuit housing units, a public laundry and bath house and the original nursing station for the Baffin region. This latter facility acted as a marshalling and drop-off point for treatment in tuberculosis hospitals. A monument to Inuit who went south as tuberculosis patients, and did not return, was commissioned by Pairijait Tigumivik, (the Iqaluit Elders' Society) and is located in front of the nursing station on the bank of the creek. Small holes in the monument act as a 'prayer wall' designed to permit the insertion of messages for departed relatives. The Inuit housing units which grew up in Apex were either in the single room \\"match-box\\" style with a pinched waist (1960s), or the 512 (named for the square footage of this housing model). The original Apex families, (including the Michael, Alainga, Peter, Joamie, Onalik and Timotee families) built these houses from standard packages supplied by government. There was also a small cannery for Arctic char, promoted by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The cannery encouraged fishing at levels which led to the demise of the Iqaluit Sylvia Grinnell River fish stocks, which are only now (~2008) showing signs of a recovery to levels which would substantiate the name \\"Iqaluit\\" for this region. During the times of Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, Stu Hodgson, and his successor John H. Parker, residents of Apex were advised that the community was inefficient and no longer required. Plans were made for it to be \\"shut down\\" by government. A number of the Inuit housing units were moved to the airpost site at Frobisher Bay, including some which were relocated while their owners were away hunting. Government functions and employment gradually moved into the more \\"convenient\\" areas around the airport site, and the population of Apex declined. Municipal by-laws restricted new housing to existing residents until 1989, when construction was again permitted. The City of Iqaluit continues to prefer not to increase housing in Apex as it is serviced by more expensive \\"trucked water and sewer\\" systems. Apex Hill has been used both as an alternate community name and as a geographic location for the hill on the east (seaward) side of the community which served as the apex (high point) for marine navigators entering Koojesse Inlet on the annual sealift and resupply. ==References== Category:Hudson's Bay Company trading posts in Nunavut Category:Populated places in the Qikiqtaaluk Region Category:Iqaluit Category:Populated places established in 1949 Category:1949 establishments in Canada ","title":"Apex, Iqaluit"},{"id":"20174716","text":"James Layng Martine Jr. (born 1942), is an American songwriter whose compositions have appeared on the country and pop music charts over a four- decade span beginning the late 1960s.

The eldest of five children, he grew up in Stamford, Connecticut. His mother wrote for a movie magazine and later a column called \\"Teen Scene\\" for Family Circle Magazine; his father sold advertising for a magazine called Babytalk and later worked for Dell Publishing Company. George T. Delacorte Jr., Dell founder, gave young Martine bundles of comic books; while reading those, Martine saw an advertisement for Cloverine Salve and greeting cards and sold these items and others door-to-door. Martine went to boarding school at Mount Hermon School in northwestern Massachusetts, then on to Denison University, but left school after the first year. Beginning in 1961, he got a job as a copyboy for Time Magazine , then was accepted to Columbia University in New York. While listening to the radio when working one summer as a house painter, Martine became convinced that he could write a song, despite the fact that he had no musical training and did not play any musical instrument. After writing his first song he had the temerity to look up established record publishers in the New York phone book, take a subway from school and present himself unannounced. His song was declined, but executives were helpful in providing advice and other contacts. After college he worked for an advertising firm on Madison Avenue, but in his free time he wrote songs. == Songs written == * \\"Don't Boogie Woogie When You Say Your Prayers Tonight\\" ‚Äì Jerry Lee Lewis, Ray Stevens, Eddy Mitchell * \\"Everybody Needs a Rainbow\\" ‚Äì Ray Stevens * \\"The Greatest Man I Never Knew\\" ‚Äì Reba McEntire * \\"I Don't Want to Be a One Night Stand\\" ‚Äì Reba McEntire * \\"I Wanna Go Too Far\\" ‚Äì Trisha Yearwood * \\"I Was Blown Away\\" ‚Äì Pam Tillis * \\"Let Me On\\" ‚Äì Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins * \\"Maybe She's Human\\" ‚Äì Kathy Mattea * \\"Rub It In\\" ‚Äì Billy \\"Crash\\" CraddockLayng Martine Jr. ‚Äì At-large representative on Nashville Songwriters Association International website. * \\"Should I Do It\\" ‚Äì The Pointer Sisters * \\"Too Fast for Rapid City\\" ‚Äì Sheila Andrews * \\"You Got The Job\\" ‚Äì Charly McClain * \\"Way Down\\" ‚Äì Elvis Presley ==References== Category:American country singer-songwriters Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Musicians from New York City Category:Songwriters from New York (state) Category:Country musicians from New York (state) ","title":"Layng Martine Jr."},{"id":"20174733","text":"is a 1999 video game developed and published by Square. The game is unique in that it combines street racing with role-playing elements. The game's story follows a new member of a street racing team in 1999 Yokohama, Japan as he tries to learn about his forgotten past and a mysterious race that took place ten years prior to the game's opening. Released for the PlayStation, the game is compatible with the Sony PocketStation. The game's music was composed by Noriko Matsueda as a jazz/techno fusion; she was joined by Takahito Eguchi as his first compositional role, and the soundtrack was released as an album. The game received poor reviews in Japan and was never released outside of the country, but still sold over 140,000 copies. ==Gameplay== The game features street-races that are initiated by flashing headlights at other drivers. Players are able to customize their car colors and other parts, and beating another driver entitles the player to pieces of the defeated car. The game features two modes: a \\"High Speed Driving RPG\\" mode, where the player drives around taking missions and racing other drivers, and a \\"2 Warriors Battle Mode\\", where the player simply competes in races. The RPG mode is the primary portion of the game. ==Story== Racing Lagoon plot takes place in Yokohama, Japan, in 1999, and centers on several groups of street racers. 10 years prior to the game an event called \\"Fastest Legend\\" took place. One night, Team Bay Lagoon Racing (BLR), a five-member team led by \\"The Ace\\", Ikki Fujisawa, holds a race against Night Racers Honmuku (NR). The story follows one of BLR's newly joined members, Sho Akasaki, who is just beginning his racing career. Akasaki is determined to find out about the mystery of the \\"Fastest Legend\\", as well as his forgotten past. == Development == The games story was greatly influenced by the illegal street racing that occurred in Japan during the 1980‚Äôs, and many of the cars used were recreated exactly for the game. ==Music== The game's soundtrack was composed by Noriko Matsueda, with a few tracks contributed by Takahito Eguchi; it was Eguchi's first compositional role. The music has been described as a jazz/techno fusion, with \\"fast-paced\\" music that includes live recordings of saxophones. == Release == Racing Lagoon was released on June 10, 1999 for the Sony PlayStation. The game managed to sell over 141,000 copies in Japan by the end of 1999. The soundtrack was released as an album on June 19, 1999 by DigiCube. The two-disc album features 62 tracks and covers a duration of 2:31:03. The game was re-released on March 20, 2002 for the PlayStation under the PS One Books line. In 2014, a Racing Lagoon event was held in Square Enix's mobile game Spirit Yankee Soul.

Born in Bendigo, Victoria, he was educated at Bendigo High School and then at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. He became a businessman, especially in tanning, building societies and gas companies. He served on Strathfieldsaye Council, and in 1907 was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly, serving until 1913. Having served as Mayor of Bendigo City Council in 1917, he returned to the Council 1922-1928 for the Country Party. On 18 October 1928, he was appointed to the Australian Senate to fill the remainder of federal Country Party Senator David Andrew's term (Andrew had chosen not to contest the 1928 election, but had died before his term expired). Thus Abbott served until the expiry of Andrew's term on 30 June 1929. He became a businessman, and died in 1940. == References  * Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate entry Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Victoria Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Victoria Category:Alumni of the University of St Andrews Category:1859 births Category:1940 deaths Category:20th-century Australian politicians ","title":"Richard Abbott (politician)"},{"id":"20174777","text":"Pocketful of Rye or pocket full of rye may refer to: * A Pocket Full of Rye, a 1953 detective novel by Agatha Christie * \\"A pocket full of rye\\", a lyric from the nursery rhyme, \\"Sing a Song of Sixpence\\" * A Pocketful of Rye, a 1969 novel by A.

It was among the most acclaimed Persian movies before the Iranian revolution and starred Behrouz Vossoughi, the most famous Iranian male actor at the time == Plot == The history of the film is based on the renewal of an old friendship happening in unforeseen and strange circumstances. Seyed (Behrooz Vousoughi) is a drug addict working small jobs in a theatre to pay for his heavy addiction. One day he is visited by an old friend, Ghodrat (Faramarz Gharibian), for whom he was a role model and protector when they were teenagers. Ghodrat has just been shot by the police when an armed robbery went wrong and is now looking for a safe place to lay low for a while. Hence, he comes to stay with the only person that he could trust, Seyed. However, what he sees is miles away from the Seyed that he knew and had in mind. Although they are both happy to find each other after so many years, Ghodrat is completely shocked to see Seyed, once the ruler of the high school yards and neighbourhoods, to have become a complete and utterly useless heavy drug user living in a lowly state of physical and social being. Seyed is very emotional to see Ghodrat. He is proud to see that some people from the old days still believe in him and are loyal to him, though he seems ashamed of what Seyed has become. Seyed helps Ghodrat by hiding him in his place, a small room containing only a bed and a samovar that is representative of the extreme poverty in which Seyed lives. They talk about the years since they had been separated. Ghodrat explains that he has become a professional thief and Seyed tells a story of how he had become an heroin addict after having served only two months in a jail for minor offenses. \\"The drug was distributed by cleaners in the jail,\\" Seyed says. Once released, he found no opportunity in life because of lack of social support, poverty and \\"drug dealers being everywhere.\\" He became a full-time heroin user after using the drug during alcohol- and drug-fueled parties with local drug dealers. During the few days that Ghodrat is staying with Seyed, he also meets with Seyed's roommate Fati, a poor but beautiful, hard-working and romantic girl from the old days who was once in love with Seyed. Fati is now completely disillusioned about the future and considers Seyed as a brother and life companion. Ghodrat wants to revive Seyed's pride by reminding him of who he was long ago and how being the role model that he was helped him not to fall into drug or alcohol addiction during all those years. Seyed tries to justify his failed life by blaming it on a lack of social and parental support, but this leads to an honest but tough exchange about the circumstances that them to their current stations in life. The discussion becomes so heated and emotional that the two start punching the wall in a show of remaining physical and mental strength. \\"It is too late,\\" Seyed says. When Ghodrat tries to talk him out of his current state of mind, Seyed responds angrily by saying that being a thief is no better than being a drug addict. In full denial, he thinks that Ghodrat has no right to lecture him about life as \\"Ghodrat is a thief and doing things against the law.\\" Ghodrat also witnesses how deeply rooted poverty and a lack of basic education affect the daily life of every neighbour in the area. He and Seyed continue to have more meaningful discussions about life, education and opportunity, but no conclusion is really achieved. They are both so sorry about how they have become that they cry at the first opportunity to have an evening meal with aragh, an anise-based alcoholic drink. Ghodrat knows that his time there is limited and that he must find a way out. The police come for Ghodrat after his picture had appeared in local newspapers as a \\"wanted and dangerous man\\"; presumably, one of the local people had informed the police of his whereabouts. The police besiege the house for several hours, but Ghodrat does not surrender. Seyed arrives home to discover the escalating situation, fearing Ghodrat's death at the hands of the large police force. He implores the police chief to allow him to enter the house in order to persuade Ghodrat to surrender. Feeling responsible for the danger in which his friend is now involved, Ghodrat beseeches Seyed not to intervene and to go away before he is hurt. However, Seyed chooses to remain with Ghodrat. He runs away from the police and is shot in the shoulder but eventually manages to get into the room with Ghodrat. The two friends reflect on the nearly certain death they are facing. After a few minutes, the building comes under heavy fire, but Seyed stays with Ghodrat when a final police raid results in both men being killed by an explosion. Just before the raid, Seyed looks at Ghodrat and says, \\"I prefer to die by a bullet here in my room with you being there rather than alone under a bridge in a few years' time.\\" This is a show of loyalty to his friend as well as an expression of his despair and hopelessness. == Cast == * Behrouz Vossoughi as Seyed Rasool * Faramarz Gharibian as Ghodrat * Nosrat Partovi as Fati * Garshasb Raoufi as Drug Dealer * Enayat Bakhshi as Landlord * Parviz Fanizadeh as Mohammad == Socioeconomic context == Some critics believe that The Deer is a deeply meaningful snapshot of life under Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, whose White Revolution drove uneducated and unskilled farmers into Iranian cultural and industrial cities, and how that socioeconomic revolution was inefficiently managed by the government. A majority of peasant migrants ended up jobless, and many became drug addicts living in overcrowded hostels. Meanwhile, a minority of the population, with access to wealth and education, reached meaningful social and economical status. This caused a layered society with a small middle class and significant social inequalities that grew significantly beginning in the late 1960s. This trend contributed to a widening gap between the richest and most educated 10% percent of the population and the 90% of the people who were poor and uneducated. This disparity occurred all across the country but was most pronounced in large cities such as the Tehran, Shiraz, Esfahan, Abadan and other large provincial cities. The Iranian Revolution of 1978-79 caused the overthrow of the Shah's regime. Dilip Hiro, author of Iran Under the Ayatollahs, said that the film \\"passed the censors with considerable difficulty.\\" The film was playing during the Cinema Rex fire on 19 August 1978, which is believed to have been a terrorist attack.Hiro, Dilip.

For two weeks, the troops tried to dislodge the Japanese defenders farther inland near Munda while Wantuck served with the beachhead and supply depot antiaircraft defense unit. On 17 July 1943, the Japanese mounted a major offensive at the severed and disoriented American forces. Though eventually stymied in their attempt, they managed to reach the perimeter of the beachhead and Private Wantuck's position. Using a light machine gun salvaged from the discard pile, Wantuck stuck to his position through the night.

His mother was a granddaughter of Count K√°roly Andr√°ssy de Cs√≠kszentkir√°ly et Krasznahorka (1723‚Äì1795), a Hungarian nobleman. His father was a businessman with the house of Mayer Amschel Rothschild. His younger brother was William Hespeler. Hespeler received his education in Nancy and moved to North America where he worked in the fur trade for several years, working first for John Jacob Astor in Chicago and then with the Hudson's Bay Company. == Business activities in Preston == Around 1835 Hespeler settled in Preston, Upper Canada (now part of Cambridge, Ontario), which was then a major German-speaking centre and a focus for German-speaking immigrants from both Europe and Pennsylvania. Hespeler began as a co-owner of a store, which he soon owned outright, and then expanded his business operations in town. He purchased a site along the Grand River intending to build a mill which would compete with the existing mill owned by the Erb family. After beginning the digging of the millrace, he was forced to abandon the project as he could not secure the necessary water rights from the Erbs. He instead bought up some land on King Street in Preston and built a grist mill, general store, and distillery. He held a number of public positions in Preston, serving as reeve, postmaster, and town councillor. == Development of New Hope / Hespeler == Beginning on February 6, 1845, Hespeler made a series of purchases of land on the west bank of the Speed River northeast of Preston, near a small settlement called New Hope, further removed from competition with the Erbs. He greatly enlarged the existing dam on the Speed, and within the next five years erected a gristmill, a sawmill, a cooperage, and a distillery. He also built stone lodgings for single men working in his buildings, and made significant donations to both the local Catholic and Lutheran churches. His distillery was unusual in Canada at the time in making use of the \\"German method\\" for producing vinegar, which allowed vinegar to be fermented through a chemical process much faster than traditional methods. In 1851 Hespeler sent a vinegar sample to The Great Exhibition in Hyde Park and subsequently began exporting vinegar to Britain regularly. In 1857 he organized a census of New Hope with the aim of seeing it incorporated, and the settlement of New Hope was proclaimed the \\"Village of Hespeler\\" in his honour effective January 1, 1859. He was elected as the first reeve of the village, serving from 1859 to 1862. == Later years == In 1861 Hespeler ran for election to the 7th Parliament of the Province of Canada as the Conservative candidate for South Waterloo, but was defeated by the Liberal James Cowan. Around 1861 he sold his properties in Preston and erected a large stone wool mill in Hespeler near the Speed River. After this mill was severely burned in 1869, Hespeler retired to California for several years before returning to Hespeler, where he died in 1881. One of his younger brothers, William, became a prominent Manitoba politician. His daughter Laura married John Walker, a prominent industrialist who served as a member of the House of Commons.

The church was originally known as The Berkeley Memorial Chapel in honor of Bishop George Berkeley of Derry. The cornerstone of the chapel was laid on October 11, 1884. The first service was held on June 23, 1885, even though the chapel was not complete. The chapel was consecrated on August 31, 1886, as a mission of the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island by Bishop Clark. In its early history, the chapel had a close association with Saint George's School in Middletown. Many of the ordained teachers officiated at services, and before the school's own chapel was built, boys walked to St. Columba's for Sunday worship. The chapel contains a collection of eleven stained-glass windows, ten by David Maitland Armstrong, executed by Tiffany Studio. The eleventh window, by an unknown artist, was donated by actor Edwin Booth, brother of John Wilkes Booth, and his daughter, Edwina, in memory of Edwina's mother, Mary Devlin.

Mansion. Joseph Vilas was a merchant and twice the mayor of Manitowoc. The 13-room house was designed by George Ferry and Alfred Clas right before they designed the Pabst Mansion in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The house sat vacant from Vilas' death in 1905 until Rahr Malting President Reinhardt Rahr purchased it in 1910. His widow donated the house to the city of Manitowoc in 1941 to use as a museum. ==Rooms== In the house's first floor, the open carriageway entrance was enclosed in 1975. During a 1950 renovation, a modern stained glass entrance was added. It leads to a room which used to consist of two rooms - reception hall and a dining room. A fireplace partition was removed in 1950 to create the single room. The Rahr parlor was used for exhibitions for around 20 years until 1977, when it was restored to its 1910 appearance. The walls are covered in silk and bordered rug and it is furnished with original furniture. The room contains a family photograph and a bronze bust by Reinhardt Rahr. One of six remaining original fireplaces is located in the room, and it contains fluted columns, floral swags, and dentils. An oval mirror is located above it. Three adjacent rooms are used to display art. Rahr parlor The John P. Nash memorial library is located at the top of the stairwell on the house's second floor. Originally a bedchamber, the room was renovated in 1995 by donations from Nash's family. The room contains a bay window, mantel, and a marbel wash basin behind a paneled door. The Schwartz Ivories Room was once a dressing or servant's room. It now contains the Simon Schwartz Collection of Chinese Ivories, which was donated to the museum in 1973. The collection contains items from over 300 years of history including over 40 rare pieces. The Porcelain Room houses a collection of hand-painted porcelain sculptures created by Boehm Studios. Mrs. Guido Rahr's collection of dolls are displayed in the Doll Room. They were acquired in her travels around the world. The items are ceremonial, folklore, and popular figures from their country. Furnished dollhouses in the room were donated by Amy Brady. The dollhouses contain 1930s furnishings from Marshall Fields. The Doll Room also contains the furnishings from a Victorian dining room. The Kamogawa Room contains a collection of gifts from Manitowoc's Japanese sister city Kamogawa. A wing was added to the house in 1975 to hold exhibits. The wing was paid for with donations from John and Ruth West and the Rahr Foundation. Another wing was added in 1986 to display and store a permanent collection of American art donated by the Wests. The museum's permanent collection holds pieces by Georgia O'Keeffe, Andy Warhol, Picasso, Isidore Bonheur, Eyvind Earle, and Milton Avery. The Courtyard Garden, located just inside the museum entrance, was established in 1975 by Mrs. John West and the Manitowoc Garden Club. It contains a bronze sculpture Waiting by Bruno Lucchesi in Wisconsin shrubs and trees. The Ruth West Gallery, the largest exhibition space, is used for around 10 exhibitions per year. It sometimes host lectures and recitals. The John West Gallery has exhibitions that changes every four to six weeks. It is sometimes used to display art of the museum's collection. Ruth West in the winter of 1974 began a community art activity for a week, the \\"Art of Tablesettings\\", featuring displays of wall art over uniquely themed tables, chairs, dishware and flatware. Drawing from a pool of registrations, eventually over thirty displays are arranged in the two 1975 gallery's west of the mansion, during the six weeks. ==Sputnikfest== Disk marks location of the Sputnik 4 impact On September 5, 1962, a piece of the 7 ton Sputnik 4 crashed on North Eighth Street east of the museum.

The Center was founded in September 2004 and formally launched in October 2005 under the notion that \\"improving understanding of China's evolving prominence in the world will be of key importance both in China itself and abroad for many years to come\\".\\"Center for China in the World Economy at the School of Economics and Management.\\" 2004. Brochure. CCWE's founding partner is BP- China. The center serves in a unique capacity as a liaison between both West and East, private and public. More specifically, the center is able to interface with both China's burgeoning market economy and its public policy makers in order to disseminate strategic policy and accurately forecast the developing role and identity of the Chinese state in the global economy. Moreover, its leadership is composed of academics with experience and expertise gained and formed in both the world's leading institutions. Operating in China's top university, the center hopes to increase its role as an elite source of information concerning China's development and growth in the 21st century. ==History== The seminal period for the center occurred from October 2003 to July 2004 when \\"over one hundred of the world's leading economic experts\\" were consulted regarding establishment. Following positive feedback, recruiting of research and administrative staff began. In September 2004, Tsinghua University formally approved the founding of the center. In February 2005, the center's executive committee was formed, holding its first meeting on 3 March of that year. In October 2005, the CCWE advisory board held its first meeting immediately preceding the first publication of the center's journal, China and World Affairs. In late October, the Center's new office location within the School of Economics and Management (SEM) became ready for use, and the formal launch of the center with its founding partner BP-China was held on October 31, 2005. ==Activities== The CCWE is primarily focuses on in-depth research on China's economic development and reform. Research interests include comparative institutional, macroeconomic, and political economic strategy policy understandings, forecasts, and recommendations. Such research is promulgated via the Center's quarterly journal, working papers, and monthly bulletin publications. Further involvement in the international academic community include the hosting of the China in the World Economy Public Lecture Series, Policy Briefing Sessions (PBS), Roundtables, the China Policy Update, international conferences, and various workshops. CCWE has also participated in IMF and World Bank forums and conferences. Recent conferences hosted by the CCWE have centered on topics such as the Sichuan earthquake and the global financial crisis. ==China and World Affairs== The main activity of the center concerns the quarterly publication of the academic journal, China and World Affairs, which was first published in October 2005. Edited and published within the CCWE by a team of professors, graduate students, editors, and staff; China and World Affairs is a policy journal primarily concerned with disseminating and proposing strategic policy as regards China's emergence onto the global stage since economic reform began in the late 1970s. The journal is composed of both Chinese and English articles. Hence, the center has both Chinese and English editing teams and submission procedures for both types of articles. Since its inception, the journal has expanded both the size of its publication as well as the number of English articles included. Since the autumn of 2008, each journal edition focuses on approximately four key issues under which included articles are organized under. Articles are published by a host of academics mainly from within China and from universities including Tsinghua University, Peking University, Fudan University, University of Hong Kong, Nankai University, Renmin University, and many other key universities located in Beijing and elsewhere. Published articles also include those written by military personnel and government officials. ==StructureDirector=== Professor David Daokui Li is currently a Mansfield Freeman Chair Professor Economic and the Director of the Center for China in the World Economy.

Prior to 2012, the FIDE gave such recognition to a limited number of tournaments, with non-FIDE recognized tournaments annually naming a world rapid champion of their own. Since 2012, FIDE has held an annual joint rapid and blitz chess tournament and billed it as the World Rapid & Blitz Chess Championships. FIDE also holds the Women's World Rapid & Blitz Chess Championship. The current rapid world champion is the Norwegian grandmaster Magnus Carlsen. Humpy Koneru from India is the current women's rapid world champion. ==Time controls== Advertisement for 1988 World Active Chess Championship The concept of rapid chess (then called \\"active chess\\") made its debut at a 1987 FIDE Congress meeting in Seville, Spain. During the World Active Chess Championship the following year, time controls were set at 30 minutes per player per game. In 1993, following his split from FIDE, world champion Garry Kasparov organized a slightly quicker version of active chess, dubbing it \\"rapid chess\\". The Professional Chess Association, Kasparov's answer to FIDE, subsequently organized two Grand Prix cycles of rapid chess before folding in 1996. Under rapid chess time controls, each player was allowed 25 minutes with an additional 10 seconds after each move. The FIDE would re-use these time controls and the \\"rapid chess\\" moniker for the 2003 FIDE World Rapid Chess Championship, held in Cap d'Agde. During the World Cup 2013, these time controls were also used for the rapid tiebreak stages. In 2012, FIDE inaugurated the World Rapid & Blitz Chess Championships. The current time controls for the rapid championship are set at 15 minutes per player, with a 10-second increment. ==FIDE-recognized events== Prior to 2012, FIDE sporadically sanctioned a world rapid chess championship. The first official high-profile rapid match took place in 1987, when then-world champion Garry Kasparov defeated Nigel Short in the \\"London Docklands Speed Chess Challenge\\" at the London Hippodrome. Kasparov won the match with 4 wins, two losses, and no draws in six games. ===1988 World Active Chess Championship=== In 1988, FIDE organized the inaugural World Active Chess Championship, a 61-player rapid chess tournament in Mazatlan, Mexico hosted by the Mazatlan Hoteliers Association. Notable participants included: # ', 2715 # , 2625 # , 2595 # , 2585 # , 2570 # , 2570 # , 2550 # , 2545 # , 2535 # , 2530 # , 2530 # , 2455 # , 2450 # , 2320 The event was won by Anatoly Karpov, who edged out GM Viktor Gavrikov on tiebreak points after their 1st-place playoff ended in a 5-5 tie. Karpov was subsequently named the new \\"Active Chess Champion\\", winning a $40,000 cash prize in the process. Garry Kasparov, the current world champion, declined to participate in the event and derided the concept of an active chess champion afterwards - he was quoted as saying, \\"Active Chess? What does that make me, the Passive World Champion?\\". The political controversy surrounding the event and the naming of a separate \\"active chess champion\\" led to the parallel rapid championship being dropped for future years. ===2001 FIDE World Cup of Rapid Chess=== In 2001, the French Chess Federation organized the 16-player World Cup of Rapid Chess at Cannes, with support from FIDE. The tournament consisted of a round-robin stage (2 groups of eight players each), followed by a set of knockout matches to determine the winner. With the Melody Amber rapid chess tournament being held concurrently, the world's top players were split between attending both events. Nevertheless, the tournament attracted a strong field headlined by the No. 1-rated player in the world - despite the World Cup's status as an FIDE event, Kasparov's contract with the French Chess Federation led to his inclusion. # ', 2849 # , 2746 # , 2745 # , 2709 # , 2695 # , 2693 # , 2676 # , 2671 # , 2663 # , 2672 # , 2663 # , 2658 # , 2622 # , 2618 # , 2618 # , 2535 In group A, Kasparov's domination of his opponents was on display: he scored 5¬Ω/7 to finish in clear 1st place, 1¬Ω points ahead of the rest of the field. Joining him in the top 4 were Bareev, Grischuk, and Judit Polgar, who beat out Peter Svidler in tiebreaks. In group B, Belgian grandmaster Mikhail Gurevich got off to a fast start with 3 wins in 4 games to finish atop the group with 5/7. Following him into the knockout stage were the two Frenchmen, Bacrot and Tkachiev, and Michael Adams. Kasparov defeated Bareev in Game 2 of the final match to win the tournament. In the endgame, Kasparov and Bareev were left with a seemingly closed position - four pawns and a King apiece. However, the position of Kasparov's king gave him a slight advantage, and with only two seconds left on his clock, Bareev could not find the drawing line and was forced to resign. {  +2001 World Cup of Rapid Chess ‚Äì Final !Name!!Rating!!1!!2!!Total - align=center ccffcc;\\"  align=left   2849  style=\\"background:black; color:white\\"  ¬Ω  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  1  1¬Ω - align=center  align=left   2709  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  ¬Ω  style=\\"background:black; color:white\\"  0  ¬Ω } ===FIDE World Rapid Chess Championship 2003=== Looking to revive the World Rapid Chess Championship, FIDE gave official \\"world title\\" recognition to the 2003 rapid chess tournament held in Cap d'Agde, France. Hosted by the Caisse Centrale d'Activit√©s Sociales des Electriciens et Gaziers de France (CCAS) on the Mediterranean coast, the 2003 tournament included eleven of the world's 12 top-ranked players along with five wild-cards. With an average rating of 2726 Elo points, the 2003 event was the strongest rapid chess tournament of all time up to that point. Included in the field were the reigning FIDE and Classical world chess champions, Ruslan Ponomariov and Vladimir Kramnik. # , 2777 # ', 2766 # , 2739 # , 2737 # , 2735 # , 2732 # , 2725 # , 2723 # , 2722 # , 2722 # , 2718 # , 2703 # , 2693 # , 2693 # , 2666 # , 2664 The field was divided into two groups of eight players each, from which eight players total would progress to the knockout stages; ties in standings were resolved by a sudden-death playoff. Vladimir Kramnik, Ruslan Ponomariov, and Etienne Bacrot scored 4¬Ω/7 to progress from Group A. Taking the final spot was Veselin Topalov, who defeated Boris Gelfand in a sudden-death playoff. In group B, Peter Svidler finished clear of the field with 5/7 to secure a spot in the quarterfinals; joining him were Alexander Grischuk, Viswanathan Anand, and Judit Polgar. Kramnik, the reigning classical world champion and tournament's No. 1 seed, dispatched Polgar and Grischuk with little difficulty to reach the final. In the other half of the bracket, Viswanathan Anand defeated Peter Svidler in a sudden-death blitz game after three drawn games to join him. After Game 1 ended in a quiet 19-move draw, Anand chose to play for complications in Game 2 in the white side of a Sveshnikov Sicilian. Following an inaccuracy from Kramnik (17... a5? 18. Na3), Anand was able to use his two knights to infiltrate Kramnik's defence, eventually forcing a queen sac to win the game and the match. {  +World Rapid Chess Championship 2003 ‚Äì Final !Name!!Rating!!1!!2!!Total - align=center  align=left   2777  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  ¬Ω  style=\\"background:black; color:white\\"  0  ¬Ω - align=center ccffcc;\\"  align=left   2766  style=\\"background:black; color:white\\"  ¬Ω  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  1  1¬Ω } ===World Rapid & Blitz Chess Championships (since 2012)=== On May 31, 2012, FIDE announced the inaugural World Rapid & Blitz Championships, set to take place in Astana, Kazakhstan from July 1 to 11. The 2012 tournament consisted of a qualifying round, followed by the rapid and blitz events held consecutively over 5 days. In order to promote viewership, time controls were set at 15 minutes per player, rather than the pre-2012 standard of 25 minutes. The championship was originally structured as a 16-player round-robin tournament, set to coincide with the first release of FIDE's rapid and blitz ratings in July 2012; invited were the top 10 players in the FIDE ratings list, the three medalists of the qualification competition, and three wild-card nominees by the organization committee and FIDE. The style has since been changed to a Swiss tournament with a field of over 100 grandmasters. The top three finishers in the standings are awarded gold, silver, and bronze medals respectively; tiebreaks are determined by ARO (average rating of opponent).

The brainchild of Hans-Walter Schmitt, the Chess Classic featured top-ranked players playing rapid and FischeRandom chess games against computers as well as each other. The main event of the classic was the Grenkeleasing World Rapid Chess Championship (formerly Fujitsu-Siemens), a tournament generally considered as the traditional rapid chess championship in the absence of an annual FIDE-recognized championship. Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand holds the record for most championship wins, having won the event 11 times in 15 years. From 1996 to 1998, the Rapid Chess Championship at Frankfurt was organized as a double-round robin, followed by a match between the 1st and 2nd-place finishers for the championship. With the addition of Karpov to the field in 1999, the format was temporarily changed to a pure round-robin, with the 1st-place finisher winning the championship. The following year the field was expanded further to include all ten of the top 10-rated Grandmasters in the world, and was dubbed a Category 21 tournament with an average Elo rating of 2767. In 2001 the event moved to Mainz, and shifted from a round-robin to a matchplay format - the defending champion Vishwanathan Anand defended his title in an eight-game match against the winner of the previous year's Ordix Open, the open rapid tournament. In 2007, with Anand still the rapid champion after six successful title defenses, the event reverted to a double-round robin tournament, with the top two finishers in the semi-finals advancing to the finals. In a homage to the Masters Tournament, the winner of the championship is traditionally awarded a winner's black jacket. In 2010, the event's final year, the Open GRENKE Rapid Championship featured a field of over 700 players. Shortly afterwards, the Chess Tigers withdrew financial backing for the event, due in part to the effects of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. {  ----- ! C0C0C0\\" Year ! C0C0C0\\" Format !

A notable omission from the field was reigning FIDE World Champion Ruslan Ponomariov. At stake was a share of the ‚Ç¨500,000 prize fund, the largest for any chess event hosted in the Czech Republic, and the EuroTel Trophy. The finalists of the tournament were determined by a series of knock- out matches, with each match consisting of two games played at rapid time controls (25 minutes per player). Ties were broken by two blitz games, followed by a sudden-death Armageddon game. # , 2838 # , 2809 # , 2752 # , 2745 # , 2744 # , 2724 # , 2718 # , 2711 # , 2710 # , 2707 # , 2704 # , 2702 # , 2698 # , 2690 # , 2688 # , 2677 # , 2676 # , 2673 # , 2659 # , 2652 # , 2647 # , 2642 # , 2641 # , 2633 # , 2631 # , 2624 # , 2618 # , 2616 # , 2610 # , 2606 # , 2596 # , 2594 The surprise of the tournament was Anatoly Karpov, who put together an impressive run with wins against Short, Kramnik, Morozevich, and Shirov to reach the finals. In the other half of the bracket, the No. 1 seed Kasparov was upset by Vassily Ivanchuk in a sudden-death game after the rapid and blitz games did not produce a winner; Ivanchuk would subsequently lose to Indian grandmaster Viswanathan Anand in the semifinals, bowing out with a loss in the second blitz tiebreak game after both rapid games ended in a draw. In the final, Anand defeated Karpov in Game 1 with White to take a 1-0 lead; Anand maneuvered his light-squared bishop to slowly gain an advantage throughout the game, before 54... a5? gave the Indian a winning advantage. In Game 2, Karpov pressed but was unable to crack Anand's Semi-Slav Defence, leading to a 34-move draw. {  +2002 EuroTel Knockout Tournament ‚Äì Final !Name!!Rating!!1!!2!!Total - align=center ccffcc;\\"  align=left   2752  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  1  style=\\"background:black; color:white\\"  ¬Ω  1¬Ω - align=center  align=left   2690  style=\\"background:black; color:white\\"  0  style=\\"background:white; color:black\\"  ¬Ω  ¬Ω } ===ACP World Rapid Cup=== Starting in 2007, the Association of Chess Professionals (ACP) sponsored an annual event billed as the ACP World Rapid Cup. The 1st edition of the event was a 16-player knockout tournament, jointly organized by the Pivdenny Bank of Ukraine and the ACP and held in Odessa, Ukraine at the Hotel Londonskaya from 4 January to 8 January 2007. The brainchild of Pivdenny Bank chairman and ACP president Vadim Morokhovsky, the tournament included the top finishers in each year's ACP Tour, a system in which participating players were ranked based on their performances in several chess tournaments held around the world. The remaining participants were chosen on a wild-card basis at the organizers' discretion. From 2007 to 2010, the tournament was held on an annual basis, with the 5th edition of the cup held in 2013. Despite the ACP Cup's status as a non-FIDE event, FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov was present at the inaugural edition of the tournament and took part in the opening ceremony. A subsequent agreement between FIDE and the ACP ensured that ACP would be able to use the title \\"World\\" when promoting and referring to the tournament. Time controls were set at 20 minutes per player, with an increment of five seconds. Each match consisted of two rapid games, with the winner progressing to the next round. Ties were resolved by two blitz games, followed by a sudden-death Armageddon game. The final match initially consisted of four rapid games, with the same tiebreaks; in 2013, the final was shortened back to two rapid games. {  ----- ! C0C0C0\\" Year ! C0C0C0\\" Host city !

The submarine could carry four crew members who operated a hand-cranked propeller and could travel underwater at four knots. Compressed air allowed it to operate underwater for a total of up to ten hours and was also used to empty the ballast tanks to allow the submarine to surface. Test dives in the Passaic River in the late 1860s were successful, but the Navy decided to abandon the purchase after its operator was murdered.

During her life she was not only a high priestess, but a member of the decurio and a benefactress to the city, funding the restoration of the main city gates between the years AD 119 and 120. ==Ancestry, family, and early life== Plancia Magna was the daughter of the Roman Senator Marcus Plancius Varus and the Herodian Princess Julia, daughter of king Tigranes VI of Armenia. Her mother became a priestess and served in the temple of the Ancient Greek Goddess Artemis in Perga. Magna married the Roman Senator Gaius Julius Cornutus Tertullus, suffect consul in 100 with his friend Pliny the Younger. Magna bore Tertullus a son, Gaius Julius Plancius Varus Cornutus.Shelagh Jameson, \\"Cornutus Tertullus and the Plancii of Perge\\", Journal of Roman Studies, 55 (1965), pp. 55f ==Activity in Perga== Plancia Magna is an example of a successful and influential woman from Anatolia. From surviving inscriptions mentioning her and her family, it is understood that they were wealthy and influential citizens in Perga. Due to the generosity of Magna, her father and her brother, they were accepted as the second founders of Perga. They each were given the honorific title of Ktistes or \\"Founder\\". In the reign of Roman Emperor Hadrian, Plancia Magna funded major civic improvements in Perga.Discussed at length in Barbara F. Caceres- Cerda, \\"The Exceptional Case of Plancia Magna: (Re)analyzing the Role of a Roman Benefactress\\" (2018), Master's Thesis (Graduate Center, CUNY) These improvements included restoration of the Hellenistic Gates at Perga, a magnificent structure that was the entrance to the city; a horseshoe-shaped courtyard adorned with a number of statues depicting various members of the imperial family and various Greek and Roman deities. These statues were annotated by a series of inscriptions indicating these were her donations; because Plotina is not referred to as diva these inscriptions should be dated before her death in 122 and after that of Salonia Matidia in 119.Jameson, \\"Cornutus Tertullus\\", p. 55 Translated from Latin [first two lines]: :to the genius of the city :Plancia Magna daughter of Marcus Translated from Greek [last two lines]: :to the fortune of the city :Plancia Magna = IK-54 90 Magna held the title of high-priestess of the temple of the ancient Greek Goddess Artemis in Perga, as well as the high-priestess of the imperial cult and the high-priestess for life of the mother of the gods. Magna was honored by the Boule, Demos and Gerousia of Perga with the honorific title of Demiourgos. The name of person who held this annual title was used to identify the year. Demiourgos was the highest civil servant position in the government of Perga. This title was usually reserved for men and through this title she had sponsored the local games held in Perga. A surviving inscription on a base from a statue erected by the community of Perga, reveals her position in the city: :Plancia Magna :Daughter of Marcus Plancius Varus :and daughter of the city. :Priestess of Artemis :and both first and sole public priestess :of the mother of the gods :for the duration of her life :pious and patriotic. When Magna died she was buried in a tomb which is located to the right of the Hellenistic Gates. == References  Further reading == * Sheila Dillon (2010).

Andrews (born April 23, 1951), known professionally as Tina Andrews, is an American actress, television producer, screenwriter, author and playwright. She played Valerie Grant in the NBC soap opera series Days of Our Lives from 1975 until 1977. Andrews also wrote the TV mini-series, Sally Hemings: An American Scandal, which was the first time that the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings had been explored on TV, and with Hemings portrayed as a fully realized woman. In 2001, Andrews was the first African American to win the Writers Guild of America award for Original Long Form, for her script for this mini-series. ==BiographyEarly life and education=== Andrews was born Yvonne L. Andrews, the oldest of two children to Eloise Andrews in Chicago, Illinois. Andrews attended Harlan Community Academy High School, where she participated in Modern Dance, Student Council and Drama Club.1969 Harlan High School (Chicago, Illinois), Falcon Yearbook.Retrieved May 15, 2020. After graduating high school in 1969, Andrews studied at New York University; majoring in Drama. ===Career=== Acting Andrews spent many years acting in such series as Days of Our Lives, where she originated the role of Valerie Grant from 1975 to 1977. Her character was part of the first interracial romance shown on daytime television. Thereafter, Andrews played Angie Wheeler in The Sanford Arms. She also acted in the influential TV mini-series, Roots (1977), as Aurelia, the girlfriend of the character Kunta Kinte. From this role, she met and became professional partners with Alex Haley, the author of the book on which it was based and the screenplay for the series. Haley hired Andrews to work with him on the miniseries Alex Haley's Great Men of African Descent, which aired on PBS. Haley also mentored Andrews' literary work. Andrews portrayed Valerie on Falcon Crest in 1983 and Josie in the television movie Born Innocent with Linda Blair. Andrews' had guest appearances as characters on many shows, including The Odd Couple, Love Story, Sanford and Son, Good Times and The Brady Bunch. She also performed in films such as Conrack and Carny. Writing Tina Andrews had been long interested in the story of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson. She wrote a play, The Mistress of Monticello, which was produced in Chicago in 1985 to good notices.Executive Producer Craig Anderson, Writer Tina Andrews, Director Charles Haid and Julia Jefferson Westerinen (Jefferson-Hemings descendant), \\"CONNECTING THE DOTS OF HISTORY: The Research and Points of View behind SALLY HEMINGS: AN AMERICAN SCANDAL\\", (part of CBS press kit for the mini-series), hosted at ibiblio, Sam Neill films, 2001 About ten years later, her play was brought to the notice of producer Craig Anderson, and he started working with Andrews on developing it as a script for TV. Her play was produced in staged readings at the Southampton Cultural Center in February 2013.The Mistress of Monticello , Southampton Cultural Center, accessed 24 September 2014 Andrews ended up working on the Hemings project for nearly 16 years. She did research, both on Hemings, about whom little is known, and Jefferson. Craig Anderson had optioned the rights to historian Fawn McKay Brodie's 1974 biography of Jefferson, which had explored the possibility of the long-rumored relationship with Hemings. She concluded that they did have a liaison and children. While Andrews was working on her script, a DNA study in 1998 demonstrated a match between the male lines of descendants of Hemings and Jefferson, which shifted the consensus of major historians of Jefferson, such as Joseph Ellis. He announced that he believed that Jefferson had a long-term relationship with Hemings and fathered all her children. Andrews completed her script, and the team took it to production. In 2000, CBS aired Sally Hemings: An American Scandal. It was directed by Charles Haid and starred Carmen Ejogo as Hemings and Sam Neill as Jefferson. As PBS noted of the mini-series in a Frontline program, Jefferson's Blood (2000), about the Jefferson-Hemings controversy, \\"Though many quarreled with the portrayal of Hemings as unrealistically modern and heroic, no major historian challenged the series' premise that Hemings and Jefferson had a 38-year relationship that produced children.\\"\\"The History of a Secret\\", Frontline: Jefferson's Blood, PBS, 1995‚Äì2011, accessed 5 May 2011 Andrews has also written screenplays, including the movie, Why Do Fools Fall in Love (1998). In 2019, Andrews joined other WGA writers in firing their agents as part of the WGA's stand against the ATA and the unfair practice of packaging. =Literary works= Following the production of the mini- series in 2000, Andrews published the non-fiction book Sally Hemings: An American Scandal: The Struggle to Tell the Controversial Truth (2001). It recounts her work over 16 years to bring Hemings' story to a larger audience. The book was published by Malibu Press. She wrote an essay for The First Time I Got Paid For It: Writers Tales From the Hollywood Trenches (2002). Andrews novel, The Hollywood Dolls (2009), was published by Malibu Press. Her Charlotte Sophia: Myth, Madness, and the Moor (2010) is a historical novel about Charlotte of Mecklenburg, the wife of King George III of England. A paperback edition was published in 2013. She explores the life of the queen, building on a 21st theory that she had a black ancestor in the 13th century. Historians do not agree on this theory, and also argue that an ancestor so far removed means little, as Charlotte was raised in the Germanic culture.Stuart Jeffries, 'Was this Britain's first black queen?', The Guardian, 11 March 2009, accessed 9 October 2014 Andrews has adapted the Charlotte novel as a play called Buckingham, which premiered at the Southampton Cultural Center in May 2013.Dawn Watson, 'Bravo To 'Buckingham, The East Hampton Press & The Southampton Press, 11 May 2013, accessed 9 October 2014 ==Awards and nominations== In 1999, Andrews received a nomination at the Acapulco Black Film Festival for Best Screenplay, for the 1998 movie Why Do Fools Fall in Love.

That year Andrews also won the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding TV Movie, Miniseries or Special. In 2002, Andrews won two awards for her book about developing the Hemings story as a TV mini-series: the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Achievement in Literary Nonfiction and the Literary Award of Excellence from the Memphis Black Writers Conference.

He had a long association with the Australian labour movement, holding senior leadership positions with the Federated Clerks' Union, Federal Miscellaneous Workers' Union, and the Melbourne Trades Hall. He served as a Senator for Victoria from 1947 to 1951, representing the Australian Labor Party (ALP). ==Early life== Katz was born on 21 May 1877 in Adelaide, South Australia. He was the son of Jane (n√©e Wiltshire) and Carl August Katz. His father was a goldsmith and jeweller of German ethnicity, although he was born in France; he had arrived in Australia in 1876. Katz and his family moved to Melbourne when he was a boy. By 1899 he was living in Fitzroy and working as a packer. He married Alicia Watkins in April 1900, with whom he had one daughter. ==Labour movement== Katz was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Victoria before joining the Victorian Socialist Party (VSP), a Marxist organisation, upon its formation in 1906. He spoke regularly at party meetings, and was a vocal opponent of electoral cooperation with the Australian Labor Party (ALP). In 1909, Katz was elected assistant secretary of the Federated Carters' and Drivers' Industrial Union. He moved to Tasmania in 1911, in order to re-organise the local branch of the union, and succeeded in increasing its membership from 30 to more than 400 within a few months. While in Tasmania, he was responsible for introducing John Curtin ‚Äì a fellow VSP member ‚Äì to his future wife Elsie. Katz led successful strikes in Hobart and Launceston, but enthusiasm later declined and he resigned his positions in January 1914 in order to return to Melbourne. During World War I, Katz was assistant state secretary of the Federated Clerks' Union. He was an opponent of conscription, and in 1915 he successful moved that the Melbourne Trades Hall ignore correspondence sent by the Federal Parliamentary War Committee. As a result of that, and likely also due to his German background, he was publicly tarred and feathered in December 1915 by several men in military uniform, outside his office in Little Collins Street. A military inquiry was established but was unable to determine the identity of those involved. Katz was federal secretary of the Federated Clerks' Union of Australia from 1920 to 1940, and was also state president. He also served as state secretary and general secretary of the Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia (1922‚Äì1927), and president of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council (1937‚Äì1938). During World War II, he represented the unions on the Cargo Control Committee, and was a deputy member of the Victorian Industrial Court of Appeals. ==Politics== Katz rescinded his earlier opposition to the ALP after World War I and served on the state executive for a number of years. He stood for Warrnambool at the 1921 Victorian state election, for the Division of Henty at the 1931 federal election, and at the 1934 Nunawading state by-election, on each occasion unsuccessfully. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for the South Melbourne City Council in 1935. The Age jokingly labeled him \\"de facto president of the Defeated Candidates' Association\\". ===Senate=== Katz was elected to the Senate at the 1946 federal election, in what was seen as a reward for years of service. His term began on 1 July 1947, just over a month after his 70th birthday. He was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and in 1951 served as chairman of the Select Committee on the Commonwealth Bank Bill. In 1949, Katz was one of only four ALP members to oppose the Chifley Government's National Emergency (Coal Strike) Bill, which made it an offence for unions to use their funds to support the New South Wales coal strike. By the time he reached the Senate he had become an anti-communist, although he opposed the Menzies Government's attempts to ban the Communist Party of Australia as he believed they were counter-productive. ==Later life== Katz lost his seat at the 1951 federal election, following a double dissolution. He died at his home in Albert Park on 13 December 1960, aged 83. ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1960 deaths Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Victoria Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Australian people of German descent Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Australian trade unionists Category:Australian socialists ","title":"Fred Katz"},{"id":"20176355","text":"Ron Cottrell (born October 11, 1960) is an American basketball coach.

He was President of the Senate from 1971 to 1974. ==Early life== Cormack was born on 12 February 1906 in Wick, Caithness, Scotland. He was the oldest of five children born to Violet () and William Petrie Cormack. His maternal grandfather John Macdonald Cameron was a Liberal Party member of the British House of Commons. Cormack's father, a medical doctor, decided to relocate to Australia for health reasons. A distant cousin was Sir Josiah Symon, a Senator for South Australia, who was also born in Wick. The family arrived in Adelaide in about 1912, and settled on the Eyre Peninsula south of Whyalla. Having begun his formal education in Scotland, Cormack attended a state school in Tumby Bay and then boarded at St Peter's College, Adelaide. From 1926 to 1931, he worked as a production manager with Holden. During the Great Depression, Cormack went into dairy farming. In later life he observed \\"I had three dairy farms, and I lost money on every one of them, so I claim to know something about dairying\\". By 1934, he and his brothers John and William had acquired Koijak, a grazing property near Apsley, Victoria, close to the South Australian border. On 22 November 1935, Cormack married Mary Isabel Macmeikan (known as Mavis) at the registrar's office in Melbourne; she was a divorcee. The couple had four children together. ==Military service== Cormack enlisted in the Militia in July 1940, and was posted to anti-aircraft regiments at Puckapunyal and Werribee. He was discharged in October 1940, but re-enlisted in June 1941 and was commissioned as a lieutenant. He received postings to the Royal Military College, Duntroon, the headquarters of the Australian Imperial Force, and the Staff College. He transferred to the regular army in August 1942. In July 1943, Cormack arrived in Port Moresby as part of the headquarters staff of the II Corps. He moved to the New Guinea Force in January 1944, where he spent four months before leaving for Townsville and receiving his discharge. He finished the war with the rank of major and was mentioned in dispatches for \\"gallant and distinguished service in Papua\\". ==Early political involvement== Cormack was a member of the Young Nationalists before the war, and joined the Liberal Party in 1946. At the 1947 Victorian state election, he managed William McDonald's campaign in the seat of Dundas, helping defeat the long- serving Labor incumbent Bill Slater. Cormack was subsequently recruited to the federal policy committee, at the urging of Robert Menzies and Richard Casey. He was state president of the Victorian Liberals from 1948 to 1949. Cormack stood for the House of Representatives at the 1949 federal election, losing to Bill Bourke in the Division of Fawkner by just 27 votes. In a speech to the Melbourne University Liberal Club in April 1950, he urged Australia to take possession of Dutch New Guinea and populate it with white settlers, in order to pre-empt an Indonesian takeover. ==Senator== At the 1951 election, Cormack was elected to the Senate in fifth place on the Coalition ticket in Victoria. He was one of the few Liberals to oppose the Menzies Government's attempts to ban the Communist Party, telling Menzies that it was \\"draconian\\". His first span in the Senate lasted only two years, as he was defeated at the 1953 half- Senate election. Shortly before his term ended, he was one of the senators chosen to represent Australia at the coronation of Elizabeth II. Prior to the 1954 election, Cormack unsuccessfully contested Liberal preselection for the Division of Wannon. His opponent was future prime minister Malcolm Fraser, who was 23 years old at the time. Fraser had not expected to win, but mounted a strong grassroots campaign and impressed with his public speaking ability. Cormack's loss led journalist Don Whitington to describe him as \\"the unluckiest man in post-war Australian politics\\". He stood for the Senate at the 1955 election without success, and then the following year was defeated by George Hannan in a ballot to fill the casual vacancy caused by John Spicer's resignation. Cormack in 1962 Cormack won first place on the Coalition ticket at the 1961 election, and was elected to a six-year Senate term commencing on 1 July 1962. He would be re-elected to further six-year terms at the 1967 and 1974 elections. The latter was cut short by a double dissolution, and at the 1975 election he won a three-year term ending on 30 June 1978. Cormack was chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1967 to 1969, and from 1970 to 1971 chaired the Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. The latter committee's report into financial malpractices received praise from the media, with The Age describing it as \\"probably the most incisive, impressive and influential document the Senate has ever produced\\". In the 1970 New Year Honours, Cormack was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE), \\"for long political and public service\\". After the disappearance of Prime Minister Harold Holt in 1967, Cormack played a role in John Gorton's ascension to the prime ministership. Their association dated back to the 1940s, when Cormack had helped recruit Gorton into the Liberal Party. According to Alan Reid, Liberal MPs \\"filed in and out of Cormack's room, some from other states, as votes for Gorton were lined up during the leadership struggle\\". The Liberal Party senators formed Gorton's power base, and Cormack helped keep them on-side during William McMahon's leadership challenges. Reid described him as \\"a manoeuvrer who preferred to work in the shadows than in strong sunlight\\".Reid (1971), p. 355. ==President of the Senate== Following the retirement of Alister McMullin, Cormack was elected President of the Senate on 17 August 1971, defeating Labor's Justin O'Byrne by 31 votes to 26. He had earlier defeated Reg Withers to become the Coalition's nominee for the position, despite Withers having the support of Prime Minister William McMahon. As president, Cormack was known as a defender of parliamentary sovereignty over the executive. He strongly supported the expansion of the committee system, which was a relatively recent innovation, and believed the Senate should function \\"largely as a committee chamber\\" rather than simply mirroring the House of Representatives. Fearing it was \\"degenerating into a propaganda forum\\", Cormack introduced new conventions for question time, allowing government ministers to terminate questions without notice and refusing to allow questions to be directed to assistant ministers. He also allowed ministers to cut short debate on a bill by simply moving that it be considered \\"urgent\\". The Labor Party did not secure a majority in the Senate at the 1972 federal election, despite winning government. Cormack was re- elected to the presidency with the support of the Democratic Labor Party's five senators. While presiding over the chamber he was generally regarded as fair and impartial ‚Äì Labor's John Wheeldon regarded him as \\"completely non- partisan\\". In January 1973, he refused a request from the Liberal Party to unilaterally recall the Senate, stating he would only do so on the advice of the government. Cormack played a role in the \\"Gair Affair\\" of 1974, which had implications for the Whitlam Government's ability to pass legislation through the Senate. He refused to accept Vince Gair's purported resignation letter, instead judging it to be ambiguous and allowing the Senate to debate whether it should be accepted. After the 1974 election, the balance of power in the Senate was shared by Steele Hall of the Liberal Movement and Michael Townley. Cormack defeated Ian Wood to become the Coalition's nominee for the presidency. It was expected that the vote for the presidency would be tied at 30 votes each for Cormack and the Labor nominee Justin O'Byrne, with the result determined by drawing lots. However, at least one Coalition senator voted for O'Byrne, who defeated Cormack by 31 votes to 29. ==Later years== In August 1974, Cormack and James Webster unsuccessfully challenged the legality of the first joint sitting of parliament. The High Court unanimously ruled that their challenge was invalid. Cormack remained an active player in the Senate after losing the presidency. He crossed the floor a total of twelve times during his career, and was a leading opponent of the Fraser Government's 1977 referendum proposals; he chaired a campaign urging voters to vote \\"No\\" on all four questions. He was particularly critical of the proposal for simultaneous elections for the House and Senate, which was the only question where the \\"No\\" vote prevailed; he described it as \\"a fraud and a deceit\\" which would eventually lead to the Senate's abolition. In March 1975, Cormack held a dinner party at his flat in Toorak, where he and other leading Liberals discussed how to remove Billy Snedden from the leadership. The leading contenders to replace Snedden were Andrew Peacock and Malcolm Fraser. Cormack was known to support Peacock, who was a close friend and something of a prot√©g√©. However, he only invited Fraser to the dinner party. Fraser was suspicious of Cormack's motives, particularly when he was asked to leave by jumping over the back fence ‚Äì supposedly to avoid photographers who were waiting outside the front door. Fraser suspected Cormack had actually arranged someone to wait by the back fence and photograph him climbing over, hoping to embarrass him and thus further Peacock's chances. He chose to leave by the front door, where there were in fact no photographers.Ayres (1987), pp. 246‚Äì248. After leaving parliament, Cormack served as the chairman of 3XY, one of Melbourne's most popular music radio stations. The station had strong ties to the Liberal Party, and its articles of association provided that any proceeds from its sale would be transferred to organisations with shared goals. When the station licence was sold for $15 million in 1986, Cormack initially wished to divide the money between the Institute of Public Affairs, the Centre for Independent Studies, and other similar think tanks. However, Liberal Party official John Calvert-Jones convinced him that the money should be used to establish a new entity, which was named the Cormack Foundation. According to The Australian, the foundation's capital had grown to almost $70 million by 2017, and it had disbursed $60 million in dividends to the Liberal Party since its creation. Cormack died in Melbourne on 26 November 1994, aged 88, after years of ill health. A memorial service was held at Old Parliament House. ==References== Category:1906 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Victoria Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:Presidents of the Australian Senate Category:Australian Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire Category:Australian politicians awarded knighthoods Category:Scottish emigrants to Australia Category:People educated at St Peter's College, Adelaide Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:People from Wick, Caithness ","title":"Magnus Cormack"},{"id":"20176441","text":"Mercator, or The Merchant, is a Latin comedic play for the early Roman theatre by Titus Maccius Plautus. It is based on the Greek play Emporos (the Merchant) by the Greek comedy playwright Philemon. It is believed to be among Plautus's first plays, possibly written around 206 BC. The central conflict involves a father who falls in love with a slave girl who is, unbeknownst to the father, his son's lover. ==Characters== *Charinus‚Äîa young merchant *Acanthio‚ÄîCharinus's slave *Demipho‚Äîfather of Charinus, also a merchant *Lysimachus‚Äîfriend of Demipho *Eutychus‚Äîfriend of Charinus, son of Lysimachus *Pasicompsa‚Äîlover and slave of Charinus *Dorippa‚Äîwife of Lysimachus *Syra‚Äîslave of Lysimachus's family *A cook *Other slaves ==Plot== The division of the play into acts does not exist in Plautus‚Äôs manuscript but was rather introduced by Renaissance scholars to match the likely division of the Greek original, though these divisions are the source of some controversy. ===Prologue=== Charinus explains that he had taken after his father's example and decided to become a merchant. He had much success in Rhodes and there fell in love with a slave woman named Pasicompsa. He purchased Pasicompsa and brought her with him to his home in Athens where he now ponders how to prevent his father from discovering his love. ===Act I=== Acanthio runs to Charinus from the harbor to deliver news that Demipho has been to the ship and seen Pasicompsa. To cover for Charinus, Acanthio had convinced Demipho that Charinus had purchased Pasicompsa to serve as a maid for Charinus's mother. He further tells Charinus that Demipho was flirting with Pasicompsa. Charinus decides he must go to the harbor at once. ===Act II=== Returning from the harbor, Demipho enters and claims that he has had a dream in which he entrusted a prize goat to his monkey friend, but the monkey lost the goat to a younger goat. He admits to his neighbor Lysimachus that he has fallen in love and feels youthful. Lysimachus leaves and Charinus enters, lamenting his predicament. Demipho then tells Charinus that Pasicompsa is too fine to be a maid and instead insists Pasicompsa be sold. The two begin a bidding war, each claiming to represent imaginary clients. Demipho rejects his son's offers and turns Charinus away from the harbor. When Charinus exits, Demipho reveals his plan to have Lysimachus purchase Pasicompsa on Demipho's behalf. Separately, Charinus sends Eutychus to purchase Pasicompsa himself. ===Act III=== Lysimachus buys Pasicompsa and is bringing her to Lysimachus's home. He tells her he bought her on behalf of her own master, and Pasicompsa is pleased, believing Lysimachus to mean Charinus. After they exit into Lysimachus's house, Demipho enters and attempts to justify what he believes he has earned with age. Lysimachus returns to Demipho and tells him he must find Pasicompsa elsewhere to stay before Dorippa returns from the countryside. For the time being, the two exit to find a cook for a feast to be held that night. Shortly after, Eutychus tells Charinus that he was too late and Pasicompsa was sold to an unknown buyer. Heartbroken, Charinus decides he will leave Athens, but Eutychus becomes determined to find Pasicompsa. ===Act IV=== Dorippa returns home from the countryside earlier than expected, and she and Syra (whose name is meant to imply her Syrian ethnicity) discover Pasicompsa in the house, believing her to be Lysimachus's mistress. Lysimachus returns home and tries to explain to his wife that he is only looking after Pasicompsa temporarily, but when the cook hired for that night's feast arrives, Dorippa becomes only more sure of her suspicions and exits into her house crying. Lysimachus dismisses the cook and follows after his wife. Eutychus returns home to find Syra outside, who urges him inside to see his father's mistress. Syra laments the inequalities between the unfaithfulness of men and women. ===Act V=== Eutychus finds Charinus just as Charinus is about to leave Athens and tells him that he has found Pasicompsa in Eutychus's own home. Charinus exits into the home, and Eutychus remains outside to confront Lysimachus and Demipho. He tells them Pasicompsa was really Charinus's lover and that Demipho should be ashamed for trying to take her for himself. He proposes a law that old men should not interfere in the passionate love of young men, and the three exit into Lysimachus's house. ==Analysis and Criticism== The play makes use of many stock characters, with which theatergoers would have been familiar. Charinus plays the role of the adulescens amator, Demipho is the senex, and Pasicompsa is the meretrix. The plot is relatively straightforward and is most easily compared to that of the Casina, which also revolves around a conflict between the adulescens and senex. The title of the play may refer to either Charinus or Demipho, as both turn out to be successful merchants. It is possible that this ambiguity was intentional. Their mercantile backgrounds seem to carry over into the rest of their lives; in many lines, Charinus and Demipho speak about Pasicompsa in language characterizing her as a commodity to be traded, rather than as a person. Pasicompsa, whose name translates to \\"pretty in every respect,\\" is the central point of contention in the play, though she is only onstage for fewer than 5% of the play's lines. She has little control over her own fate, which is dictated by men. Even though Charinus appears to be in love with her, Pasicompsa's non-citizen status means she and Charinus would never be allowed to marry, thus destining Pasicompsa to a life of being passed between owners. ==Translations== * Henry Thomas Riley, 1912: Mercator full text * Paul Nixon, 1916‚Äì38 * Charles T.

Deweare stated in a 2006 interview: \\"It's [Beck] that inspired me to sing, to produce something aesthetic.\\" Prior to coming to Canada, Deweare moved to Brussels and recorded some material under the name Franck Marx, on the same label as Belgian rock band dEUS. His work under the Marx moniker leaned towards a more aggressive rock/grunge sound. == Move to Montreal == Deweare has stated in more than one interview that his reason for leaving France was due to the political climate and the increasing racial tensions within the country. He stated that he chose Canada because he thought of the country as \\"an example of integration working.\\" By chance, Deweare struck-up a conversation with Qu√©b√©coise musician Ariane Moffatt in 2004 during a flight delay at Charles de Gaulle Airport on his way to Canada for the very first time.

He was a member of the Liberal Party for all but the last few months of his career, and was known as a strident anti-communist. He lost Liberal preselection in 1973, and the following year announced the formation of a new social conservative political party, the National Liberal Party. He was unsuccessfully in his bid for re-election at the 1974 election and dissolved the party shortly after. ==Early life== Hannan was born on 10 September 1910 in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. He was the oldest son of Theresa Caroline (n√©e Reis) and James Francis Hannan. His father, a country storekeeper, was a Lang Labor supporter and stood for the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in Albury at the 1927 New South Wales state election. Hannan was educated at St Patrick's College, Goulburn, before going on to study law at the University of Melbourne where he was a member of Newman College. He completed his articles of clerkship in 1933 and was admitted to the Victorian Bar the following year. He married Eileen Frances Williams in 1938, with whom he had four children. During World War II, Hannan was a member of the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve. He was mobilised in 1942 and was stationed at the base as a radar officer. After his discharge in 1946, he resumed his legal career but was also employed as a social commentator on 3XY, a Melbourne radio station strongly linked with the Liberal Party. He was a life member of the Wireless Institute of Australia and was an active member of Actors Equity of Australia. ==Politics== Hannan served on the state executive of the Liberal and Country Party for over a decade. He first stood for parliament in 1948, losing a Victorian Legislative Council by-election for Melbourne Province. He subsequently contested the Division of Maribyrnong at the 1949 federal election and East Yarra Province at the 1952 Legislative Council election. Hannan was an unsuccessful candidate for Senate preselection prior to the 1955 federal election. On 28 August 1956, he was appointed to the Senate to fill the casual vacancy caused by the resignation of John Spicer. He defeated Magnus Cormack for the position. At the 1958 federal election he was elected to a full term. He was defeated in 1964, his term ending on 30 June 1965. He was re-elected at the 1970 Senate election, taking his place immediately. In 1974, he resigned from the Liberal Party, forming a new party, the National Liberal Party, under which banner he contested the 1974 double dissolution election. He received 1.2 per cent of the vote, and was not elected. George Hannan died on 1 May 2009, aged 98.Fairfax digital classifieds He was the last surviving member of the 1956‚Äì1962 Senate. ==Family== Both he and his wife Eileen n√©e Williams were lawyers.

He received both Bachelors and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University (1963, 1970), having conducted fieldwork in Peru, and then with Sally Price in Martinique, Mexico, Spain, and for two years among the Saamaka Maroons of Suriname. A year studying with Claude L√©vi-Strauss in Paris and another in Amsterdam working with Dutch scholars of Maroons preceded his five years of teaching in the Department of Anthropology at Yale University. In 1974, he moved to Johns Hopkins University to found the Department of Anthropology, where he served three terms as chair, before leaving in 1986 for two years of teaching in Paris. A decade of freelance teaching (University of Minnesota, Stanford University, Princeton University, University of Florida, Universidade Federal da Bahia), while based in Martinique, ended with an appointment as Duane A. and Virginia S. Dittman Professor of American Studies, Anthropology, and History at the College of William and Mary. He has continued fieldwork with Maroons, notably in French Guiana and Suriname, as well as with his Martiniquan neighbors, into the present. Since the 1990s, he has worked with Saramaka Maroons in defense of their human rights, twice testifying as expert witness on behalf of the Saamakas in cases that they eventually won before the Inter-American Court for Human Rights in Costa Rica.Richard Price, Rainforest Warriors: Human Rights on Trial, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011 == Contributions == Price's early contributions, influenced by his teachers Clyde Kluckhohn, Evon Z. Vogt, and Sidney W. Mintz, included the first conceptualization of Maroon (runaway slave) communities throughout the Americas in a comparative framework.Richard Price, Maroon Societies: Rebel Slave Communities in the Americas. New York: Doubleday/Anchor, 1973. His demonstration that people previously considered largely ‚Äúwithout history,‚Äù such as Saamaka Maroons (the descendants of runaway slaves), in fact possessed rich and deep historical consciousness has influenced historians as well as anthropologists.Eric J. Hobsbawm, ‚ÄúEscaped Slaves of the Forest.‚Äù New York Review of Books 37(19) (1990): 46‚Äì48; David Scott, ‚ÄúThat Event, This Memory: Notes on the Anthropology of African Diasporas in the New World.‚Äù Diaspora 1(1991):261-284; Michel-Rolph Trouillot, ‚ÄúThe Caribbean Region: An Open Frontier in Anthropological Theory.‚Äù Annual Review of Anthropology 21 (1992):19-42. For this work in what he calls ‚Äúethnographic history,‚Äù Price's books have won numerous awards: First-Time won the Elsie Clews Parsons Prize of the American Folklore Society and Alabi‚Äôs World won the Albert J. Beveridge Award of the American Historical Association, the Gordon K. Lewis Award of the Caribbean Studies Association, and the School of American Research's prestigious J. I. Staley Prize. An essay originally written in 1973 with Sidney Mintz, The Birth of African-American Culture, has had considerable influence on Afro-Americanist historians and anthropologists, sometimes inciting strong controversy about the extent to which enslaved Africans and their descendants ‚Äúretained‚Äù aspects of their home cultures and societies and the extent to which they created new cultural and social forms in the Americas.Sidney W. Mintz and Richard Price, The Birth of African-American Culture.

Yelvington (ed.), Afro-Atlantic Dialogues: Anthropology in the Diaspora. Santa Fe: SAR Press, 2006, pp. 113-145, 206. Price's Travels with Tooy, an ethnography of the imaginaire of a Saamaka healer, attempts to transcend this dichotomy by demonstrating that historical processes of creolization involved people making creative uses of their varied, specific African heritages in the process of nation-building in the New World. In 2008, Travels with Tooy won the Victor Turner Prize in Ethnographic Writing, and in 2009, the Gordon K. and Sybil Lewis Award for Caribbean Scholarship and the Clifford Geertz Prize in the Anthropology of Religion. Price's Rainforest Warriors tells the story of the Saamaka struggle to protect their territory against the encroachments of the State of Suriname. In 2012, the book won the Best Book Prize of the American Political Science Association in the field of human rights and the Senior Book Prize of the American Ethnological Society.

All players in the league must have NCAA eligibility remaining in order to participate. So as to maintain their college eligibility, players are not paid. Beginning in 2012, the league added four games to the season, making a total of 60 games per team (30 home and 30 road). ==League historyOrigin=== In 1963, the Central Illinois Collegiate League (CICL), the precursor league to the Prospect league, was formed as a charter member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) summer collegiate baseball program. The league existed under NCAA rules and guidance for 41 years. In 2005, the NCAA ended its official association with summer collegiate baseball; however, the CICL continued to preserve the amateur status of its member athletes by abiding by the rules and regulations of the National Alliance of College Summer Baseball (NACSB). In 2009, the CICL planned to expand to six teams by adding the Hannibal Cavemen, but in winter 2008, the league ownership voted for further expansion. Dr. Chris Hanners, owner of the Chillicothe franchise and one of the founders of the independent professional Frontier League, wanted to keep a Paints baseball team in Chillicothe. Dr. Hanners, Leo Trich, former Frontier league director of development; General Manager and majority owner of the Butler BlueSox, and Duke Ward, former owner of the Frontier League's Richmond Roosters worked with the ownership of the CICL to form the Prospect League. The Prospect League began its inaugural season in summer 2009 with the original CICL teams forming the Western Division. Five expansion teams formed the Eastern Division. Three of the Eastern Division teams began play in markets previously served by Frontier League teams. Besides the Chillicothe Paints, the Richmond RiverRats (Richmond, Indiana) played in the previous home of the Frontier League's Richmond Roosters, which are now the Traverse City Beach Bums. The Slippery Rock Sliders (Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania) played in the previous home of the Frontier League team of the same name. ===2010 expansion=== In 2010, the Prospect League expanded adding four new franchises: the Terre Haute Rex (Terre Haute, Indiana), the West Virginia Miners (Beckley, West Virginia), the DeKalb County Liners (Sycamore, Illinois), and the Nashville Outlaws (Nashville, Tennessee). Due to a change in team ownership in 2010, the North Coast Knights became the Lorain County Ironmen. ===2011 and 2012 team departures=== In 2011 the DuPage Dragons franchise folded after five years with the CICL (2006‚Äì08) and Prospect League (2009‚Äì10). As a result the league returned to a 2-division format after having 3 divisions in 2010. Richmond was moved to the six-team Eastern Division, while Danville, Nashville, Terre Haute, and Dubois County were moved to the eight-team Western Division. Before the 2012 season, the Nashville Outlaws folded, and the DeKalb County Liners left the league to join the Midwest Collegiate League, leaving the Prospect League with twelve teams in two, six-team divisions. The 2012 schedule consisted of 60 games with no \\"cross-over\\" games; with all games played among teams from the same division only. The only time teams from opposite divisions meet is in the Championship Series. ===Expansion into New York=== For the 2015 season, the league added its easternmost team yet, the Jamestown Jammers (Jamestown, New York). The Kokomo Jackrabbits (Kokomo, Indiana) were also added to the league to play in the new Kokomo Municipal Stadium, set to open for the 2015 season. After the 2015 season, the Richmond RiverRats folded, and the Jamestown Jammers moved to the Perfect Game Collegiate Baseball League after just one season in the Prospect League. ===Lafayette and DuPage join the league=== The league stayed at 12 total teams for the 2016 season by adding the new Lafayette Aviators (Lafayette, Indiana) and DuPage Drones (Lisle, Illinois). ===2017 contraction=== For the 2017 season, the league contracted to 10 teams, as the Hannibal Cavemen and DuPage Drones both ceased operation. Hannibal reentered the league for the 2018 season as the Hannibal Hoots. ===2019 expansion and reorganization=== The league returned to a twelve team league for the 2019 season with the addition of the Cape Catfish in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, the departure of the Kokomo Jackrabbits to the Northwoods League, the addition of the Normal CornBelters from the Frontier League and the addition of the DuPage Pistol Shrimp in Lisle, Illinois. The 2019 league featured two divisions, each with six teams.

Winners from each half in each division faced each other in a one-game playoff (home field to team with best overall record). Where the same team won both halves in a division, the team with the next-best overall record from that division was declared the wild card. Championship Series was a two-game affair with the divisional playoff winner with the best overall record receiving a bye into the Championship Game. The remaining two divisional playoff winners met in a one-game play-in for the right to go to the Championship Game. Championship Series held at Chillicothe, Ohio.

The game was documented by Henry Parker in Ancient Ceylon: An Account of the Aborigines and of Part of the Early Civilisation (1909); the game was printed as \\"Kotu Ellima\\" which is actually a misspelling because his source for the game was Leopold Ludovici's Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (1873), and specifically in the chapter entitled \\"The Sports and Games of the Singhalese\\", and Ludovici wrote the name of the game as Kotu Ellime or Taking of the Castles.Singhalese is an archaic spelling of SinhaleseTaking of the Castles may not be an actual Sinhalese-to-English translation of Kotu Ellime. Kotu may not actually be a Sinhalese word, but a close Sinhalese word is koti which means tiger. But Kotu may actually be an arachaic spelling of the Tamil word for castle which is K≈ç·π≠·π≠ai. The Tamils are also an ethnolinguistic group inhabiting Sri Lanka. It's unsure what ellime may actually mean in English. The game is similar to draughts (checkers) and Alquerque as players hop over one another's pieces to capture them; it is more similar to Alquerque between the two since it uses a standard Alquerque board. However, unlike draughts and standard Alquerque, the game is played on an expanded Alquerque board consisting of four triangular boards attached to the four sides of a standard Alquerque board. It closely resembles Peralikatuma and Sixteen Soldiers (or Sholo Guti) which are also played in Sri Lanka and other parts of the Indian subcontinent with the only difference being the number of pieces. In Sixteen Soldiers, each player has 16 pieces hence the name of the game. In Peralikatuma, each player has 23 pieces. In Kotu Ellima, each player has 24 pieces, and at the beginning of the game the whole board is covered with them except the central point reminiscent of standard Alquerque. == Setup == An expanded Alquerque board is used. Four triangle boards are attached to the center of the four sides of an Alquerqe board. Each player has 24 pieces distinguishable from the other player. Pieces are placed on the intersections (or \\"points\\") of the board, and specifically on their half of the Alquerque board, the nearest triangular board and the triangular board on their right. Their last piece is placed on the point to the right of the central point of the Alquerque board. Only the central point is left vacant in the beginning of the game. == Rules == * Players alternate their turns * A player may only use one of their pieces in a turn, and must either make a move or perform a capture but not both. * A piece may move onto any vacant adjacent point along a line.The piece may also move in any direction provided it is available unlike in most variants of draughts where pieces are initially restricted to the forward direction * A piece may capture an opposing piece by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerque. The piece must be adjacent to the opposing piece, and leap over it onto a vacant point immediately beyond. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board.Ludovici does not mention if the piece can continue to capture within the same turn as found in many draught variants and Alquerque. Nor does he mention if captures are obligatory. The captured piece is removed from the board. * The player who captures all of the other player's pieces wins. == Related games == *Peralikatuma *Sixteen Soldiers (Sholo guti) *Permainan-Tabal *Draughts *Alquerque *Terhuchu, and the variant called War Game *Meurimueng-rimueng peuet ploh *Satoel *Astar (game) == Notes References External links == *Bona Ludo, 16 soldiers, Peralikatuma, Cows and leopards and Kotu ellima ‚Äì cousins of Halatafl and Draughts *Ares Cronida,The games of soldiers *Cyningstan, Traditional Board Games, Sixteen Soldiers Category:Abstract strategy games Category:Traditional board games ","title":"Kotu Ellima"},{"id":"20176704","text":"Tellus Series B: Chemical and Physical Meteorology is a scientific journal that was published by Blackwell Publishing for the International Meteorological Institute in Stockholm, Sweden until December 2011.

These pictures are \\"designed to offer readers a high-utility message in a minimum amount of space.\\" (Beers, 129) Some languages, for example, many East Asian languages, such as Chinese varieties (e.g. Mandarin, Cantonese, Min, and Wu), and partially Korean and Japanese, are written in logographic scripts; single glyphs represent whole morphemes.http://www.omniglot.com/writing/chinese.htm Examples of logographic cues include traffic signs, restroom signs, and pictorial flashcards. Unsurprisingly, logographic cues tend to be processed in the right brain hemisphere, the side more actively engaged with visuospatial input. Due to advances in technology and the media where logographic cues such as brand logos abound, the ability and tendency to draw meaning from pictures has become more widespread and intuitive. ==Utility to education== Logographic cues have also become increasingly useful in the domain of education, specifically in the development of reading skills. Many sources of educational advice suggest the use of logographic cues to tap into visual learning and intelligence, which usually takes a subordinate role to verbal education in schools; such sources include literacy expert Kylene Beers and a nationwide reading program, All America Reads. Specific activities that utilize logographic cues include: students making symbols within the margins of print text and worksheets that provide a pictorial summary of the information given and picture flash cards that foster vocabulary development. (Kajder, 43) Teaching methods employing logographic cues can help to encourage and increase word recognition, text reformulation and information organization. The method also helps to tap into the sensory stimulation that encodes information into long-term memory. ==Criticisms== The use of this method has also received some criticism. In reference to the use of logographic cues to develop word recognition the International Journal of Disability, Development and Education writes that ‚Äúthe results of controlled studies show it to be ineffective and potentially detrimental to student learning.‚Äù (Sheehy, 47) The particular study documented in this journal suggested similar but modified alternatives such as Integrated Picture Cueing or the Handle Technique. The Integrated Picture Cueing (IPC) technique makes pictures out of the desired words, themselves, rather than symbolic pictorial depictions. The Handle Technique depicts the word with an extra serif (handle) that helps students encode the word and its meaning. Despite these findings and alternatives, logographic cues are widely used and encouraged in education. ==NotesReferences== # Beers, Kylene. When Kids Can't Read What Teachers Can Do.

In 1973, New Birth recorded a James Brown-esque style recording of the song with lead singer Leslie Wilson, who sounded like Womack, was vocally influenced by Sam Cooke. Their fast-paced version peaked at number four on the R&B; charts and number thirty-five on the Hot 100. The New Birth version is the better- known version and has garnered praise. In 1975 Columbia records released a third version of this classic track. The least known of the three, this version by Kokomo, a British-soul group, includes delicately mixed congas with a tempo similar to New Birth's and is perhaps, musically, the funkiest of the three.

Paul Getty Trust. He is on the Board of Selectors of Jefferson Awards for Public Service. ==Early life and education== Munitz was born and raised in Brooklyn, the son of parents from Eastern Europe. Munitz earned a B.A. degree in classics and comparative literature at Brooklyn College in 1963. He earned M.A. and Ph. D. degrees in comparative literature from Princeton University. ==Career== Munitz's first teaching job was at the University of California, Berkeley from 1966 to 1968, where he also worked as a part-time assistant to the UC system president, Clark Kerr. When Kerr resigned and became chairman of the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in 1968, he brought along Munitz as a staff associate. In 1970 Munitz moved to the University of Illinois, and was soon promoted to vice president for academic affairs at the University of Illinois, Chicago from 1972 to 1976. ===University of Houston (1977-1982)=== When Philip G. Hoffman resigned as president of the University of Houston to become the first chancellor of the newly created University of Houston System, the university was looking for someone who could fill the shoes of its popular leader from 1962 to 1977. They turned to 35-year-old \\"wunderkind\\" Barry Munitz --then serving as vice-president and dean of faculties in the system office-- to be the new president of the University of Houston. It was anticipated that Munitz could work with the business community to build up the University's endowment. After several years, Munitz's cultivating the business community led to an offer to join a local corporation, Maxxam, Inc., that was busy acquiring other companies in leveraged buyouts. ===Maxxam, Inc. (1982-1991)=== Charles Hurwitz, Maxxam's president, hired Munitz as vice-president in 1982. Munitz was active with Maxxam's related companies, including serving as chair of the executive committee of United Savings Association of Texas (USAT), and assisted Hurwitz with his 1985 take-over of Pacific Lumber Company, with its old-growth redwoods, including Headwaters Forest in northern California.David Harris, The Last Stand, Sierra Club Books, 1997, pp. 1-137. USAT became the fifth-largest savings and loan failure at a cost to the public of $1.6 billion. ===California State University (1991-1998)=== In 1991 Munitz was selected as chancellor of the 23-campus California State University, the country's largest senior system of public higher education. He introduced management practices from the corporate world, including tying a portion of salary increases for faculty to performance reviews, evaluating campus presidents on their success in fund-raising from the private sector, and mandating a common financial and data management system for all campuses. ===J. Paul Getty Trust (1998-2006)=== In 1997 Munitz was named the president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust,Vince Stehle, \\"New View From the Top of the Art World's Hill,' The Chronicle of Philanthropy, October 22, 1998, pp. 9-10. which oversees the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, California, the Getty Foundation, the Getty Research Institute, and the Getty Conservation Institute.

With an endowment of $4.2 billion, the Getty Trust is the wealthiest art institution in the world.Edward Wyatt, \\"Getty Fees and Budget Reassessed,\\" The New York TImes, April 30, 2009, p. C1. Early in his tenure, Munitz reorganized the Getty Trust, closing two of the institution's six programs‚Äîthe Getty Information Institute and the Getty Education Institute. To deal with long-run financial issues, he sought to cultivate relationships with donors and corporate partners. His leadership became increasingly controversial as the Getty Trust was embroiled in numerous controversies relating to the provenance of various antiquities in the Getty Museum's collections and Munitz' expense account. In the midst of an investigation by the California Attorney General, Munitz resigned in 2006 and was forced to \\"forgo his severance package of more than $2 million, and reimburse the Getty Trust for $250,000 after alleged improprieties including lavish expense account spending.\\"Martin Filler, \\"The Getty: For Better and Worse.\\" The New York Review of Books, November 16, 2006, p. 47. ===post-Getty=== After leaving the Getty Trust, Munitz returned to the California State University as a Trustee Professor, based at California State University, Los Angeles. Munitz has served on the Princeton University Board of Trustees, and chaired the American Council on Education and the California Education Roundtable.

Before The Crash Moderns, frontman Danny Roselle (born Daniel William Roselle on August 19, 1981) was in the band No Soap Radio, known for their music on The Sopranos. He is also an occasional fill in member of the band Dramarama. Joe Trent, has played with many notable acts including Jersey favorites Lady Radiator. He is well known for his Gaming blog on YouTube under the name \\"akaTRENT\\". Paolo Dell'olio was a previously a member of Milan Italy-based band, The New Story. (EMI) ==History== The band's first album, Good Night Glamour, Good Morning Disaster, was recorded at Near Studios in Long Branch, New Jersey. The album was mixed and produced by long-time friends Bart Schoudel and Ron Haney of the band The Churchills. The album was recorded in a span of one and a half months in November/December 2007. Late December 2007, the album was mastered by Chris Ghehringer at Sterling Sound in New York City. In April 2008, the album was officially released. At first, the album was only available at their live performances, but soon was quickly picked up by the teenage rock/pop culture store Hot Topic. The CD was then only available in the New York/New Jersey region, but has spread since then to different stores throughout the country. Today, the album is available everywhere in the world through iTunes and Amazon.com. Support for the album started immediately after its release with several east coast tours as well as a nationwide tour in April 2008. Through the Summer into the fall of 2008, the band continued touring and doing festivals. Some shows on these tours included opening slots for The Ataris, Go Radio, The Teenagers, and Eve 6. The band also took part in a very high- profile series of shows in front of thousands on South Padre Island, Texas for the Blender Sessions Spring Break concert alongside other great artists such as Cartel, Forever the Sickest Kids, and All Time Low. December 2008, the band found themselves back in the studio recording a cover of The Monroes single What Do All The People Know? as well as re-recording several songs off of Good Night Glamour, Good Morning Disaster. This time, they recorded and mixed with Kenny Gioia in Queens, New York. In August 2010, The Crash Moderns, while still on tour supporting Good Night Glamour, Good Morning Disaster were asked by the US military to travel to Japan to play for the troops stationed on the island of Okinawa. The band also had the chance to showcase in March at the 2009 SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Texas. ==Personnel== As of February 2010 the band lineup now consists of: *Danny Roselle -Vox/rhythm guitar/ synth *Joe \\"akaTRENT\\" - bass/ Vox *Mikey Vranek -lead guitar, keys ==Discography== * 2004: The Crash Moderns (EP) * 2008: Good Night Glamour, Good Morning Disaster * 2009: Re-recorded songs: Pimp My Life, Where Did All the Scene Girls Go?, This Time, Everybody Hates Me * 2009: What Do All the People Know? - Cover song by The Monroes ===Good Night Glamour, Good Morning Disaster Track listing=References * Album review at AbsolutePunk.net # Shockhound: # ReverbNation: Category:American power pop groups Category:Musical groups from New York City Category:Musical groups established in 2004 ","title":"The Crash Moderns"},{"id":"20176956","text":"The is a cable-stayed bridge in Aomori, Aomori Prefecture, Japan. It was constructed in order to alleviate cargo ship traffic. It is a very notable part of Aomori's skyline. ==Details== The Aomori Bay Bridge is the longest bridge in the city of Aomori at 1219 meters. It's the second longest bridge in Aomori Prefecture after the 1323.7 meter Hachinohe ≈åhashi Bridge. Previously the longest bridge in Aomori City was the 993.9 meter Aomori West Bypass overpass, it's now the third longest bridge in Aomori Prefecture. Emphasis was placed on the aesthetics of the bridge, causing the total cost of construction to come to approximately 27 billion yen (¬•) in comparison to only ¬•8.9 billion for the longer Hachinohe ≈åhashi Bridge. An example of the emphasis on the bridge's appearance is the emblazoning of the letter \\"A\\", for \\"Aomori\\", at various places such as the base of the bridge and in the shape of the suspension cables. The use of the letter \\"A\\" continues on from the nearby Aomori Prefecture Sightseeing Products Mansion, or ASPAM Building, which is built in the shape of a triangle so that it would look like the initial \\"A\\". The bridge's main towers are made from high strength concrete. In response to the bridge's long standing problems with ice in the winter months, a plan was made to lay pipes circulating sea water under the road surface to melt the ice. However, due to problems related to the cost and construction time, only one section was able to be completed. As yet there are no indications of when the system will be implemented over the remainder of the bridge as originally planned. Even so, since the installation of the system the number of traffic accidents has drastically decreased. ==Development== * 1982 ‚Äì Project created (Project name: Aomori Port Improvement Project, planned to bridge a 1993-meter section) * 1985 ‚Äì Construction begins on the bridge. * 1992 ‚Äì July ‚Äì Tentatively, two lanes are opened for traffic.

Often the knee is partly bent, painful and swollen. The patella is also often felt and seen out of place. Complications may include a patella fracture or arthritis. A patellar dislocation typically occurs when the knee is straight and the lower leg is bent outwards when twisting. Occasionally it occurs when the knee is bent and the patella is hit. Commonly associated sports include soccer, gymnastics, and ice hockey. Dislocations nearly always occur away from the midline. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and supported by X-rays. Reduction is generally done by pushing the patella towards the midline while straightening the knee. After reduction the leg is generally splinted in a straight position for a few weeks. This is then followed by physical therapy. Surgery after a first dislocation is generally of unclear benefit. Surgery may be indicated in those who have broken off a piece of bone within the joint or in which the patella has dislocated multiple times. Patellar dislocations occur in about 6 per 100,000 people per year. They make up about 2% of knee injuries. It is most common in those 10 to 17 years old. Rates in males and females are similar. Recurrence after an initial dislocation occurs in about 30% of people. ==Signs and symptoms== People often describe pain as being \\"inside the knee cap.\\" The leg tends to flex even when relaxed. In some cases, the injured ligaments involved in patellar dislocation do not allow the leg to flex almost at all. ==Risk factors== A predisposing factor is tightness in the tensor fasciae latae muscle and iliotibial tract in combination with a quadriceps imbalance between the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis muscles can play a large role, found, mainly, in women with higher level the physical activity. Moreover, women with patellofemoral pain may show increased Q-angle compared with women without patellofemoral pain. Another cause of patellar symptoms is lateral patellar compression syndrome, which can be caused from lack of balance or inflammation in the joints. The pathophysiology of the kneecap is complex, and deals with the osseous soft tissue or abnormalities within the patellofemoral groove. The patellar symptoms cause knee extensor dysplasia, and sensitive small variations affect the muscular mechanism that controls the joint movements. 24% of people whose patellas have dislocated have relatives who have experienced patellar dislocations. ===Athletic population=== Patellar dislocation occurs in sports that involve rotating the knee. Direct trauma to the knee can knock the patella out of joint. ===Anatomical factors=== People who have larger Q angles tend to be more prone to having knee injuries such as dislocations, due to the central line of pull found in the quadriceps muscles that run from the anterior superior iliac spine to the center of the patella. The range of a normal Q angle for men ranges from <15 degrees and for females <20 degrees, putting females at a higher risk for this injury. An angle greater than 25 degrees between the patellar tendon and quadriceps muscle can predispose a person to patellar dislocation. In patella alta, the patella sits higher on the knee than normal. Normal function of the VMO muscle stabilizes the patella. Decreased VMO function results in instability of the patella. ===Forces=== When there is too much tension on the patella, the ligaments will weaken and be susceptible to tearing ligaments or tendons due to shear force or torsion force, which then displaces the kneecap from its origination. Another cause that patellar dislocation can occur is when the trochlear groove that has been completely flattened is defined as trochlear dysplasia. Not having a groove because the trochlear bone has flattened out can cause the patella to slide because nothing is holding the patella in place. ==Mechanism of injury== Anatomy of the Knee Patellar dislocations occur by: * A direct impact that knocks the patella out of joint * A twisting motion of the knee, or ankle * A sudden lateral cut ===Anatomy of the knee=== The patella is a triangular sesamoid bone which is embedded in tendon. It rests in the patellofemoral groove, an articular cartilage-lined hollow at the end of the thigh bone (femur) where the thigh bone meets the shin bone (tibia). Several ligaments and tendons hold the patella in place and allow it to move up and down the patellofemoral groove when the leg bends. The top of the patella attaches to the quadriceps muscle via the quadriceps tendon, the middle to the vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis muscles, and the bottom to the head of the tibia (tibial tuberosity) via the patellar tendon, which is a continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon. The medial patellofemoral ligament attaches horizontally in the inner knee to the adductor magnus tendon and is the structure most often damaged during a patellar dislocation. Finally, the lateral collateral ligament and the medial collateral ligament stabilize the patella on either side. Any of these structures can sustain damage during a patellar dislocation. ==Diagnosis== Patellar dislocation To assess the knee, a clinician can perform the patellar apprehension test by moving the patella back and forth while the people flexes the knee at approximately 30 degrees. The people can do the patella tracking assessment by making a single leg squat and standing, or by lying on his or her back with knee extended from flexed position. A patella that slips laterally on early flexion is called the , and indicates imbalance between the VMO and lateral structures. On X-ray, with skyline projections, dislocations are readily diagnosed. In borderline cases of subluxation, the following measurements can be helpful: *The lateral patellofemoral angle, formed by: :*A line connecting the most anterior points of the medial and lateral facets of the trochlea. :*A tangent to the lateral facet of the patella. :With the knee in 20¬∞ flexed, this angle should normally open laterally. *The patellofemoral index is the ratio between the thickness of the medial joint space and the lateral joint space (L). With the knee 20¬∞ flexed, it should measure 1.6 or less. File:Lateral patellofemoral angle.jpg File:Lateral and medial joint space of patella.jpg ==Prevention== The patella is a floating sesamoid bone held in place by the quadriceps muscle tendon and patellar tendon ligament. Exercises should strengthen quadriceps muscles such as rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis. However, tight and strong lateral quadriceps can be an underlying cause of patellar dislocation. If this is the case, it is advisable to strengthen the medial quadriceps, vastus medialis (VMO), and stretch the lateral muscles. Exercises to strengthen quadriceps muscles include, but are not limited to, squats and lunges. Adding extra external support around the knee by using devices such as knee [orthotics] or athletic tape can help to prevent patellar dislocation and other knee-related injuries. External supports, such as knee braces and athletic tape, work by providing movement in only the desired planes and help hinder movements that can cause abnormal movement and injuries. Women who wear high heels tend to develop short calf muscles and tendons. Exercises to stretch and strengthen calf muscles are recommended on a daily basis. ==Treatment== X-ray and MRI after luxation of the patella. There is a fragment and bone bruise at the medial surface of the patella and in the corresponding surface of the lateral condyle of the femur. The medial retinaculum of the patella is disrupted. Two types of treatment options are typically available: * Surgery * Conservative treatment (rehabilitation and physical therapy) Surgery may impede normal growth of structures in the knee, so doctors generally do not recommend knee operations for young people who are still growing. There are also risks of complications, such as an adverse reaction to anesthesia or an infection. When designing a rehabilitation program, clinicians consider associated injuries such as chipped bones or soft tissue tears. Clinicians take into account the person's age, activity level, and time needed to return to work and/or athletics. Doctors generally only recommend surgery when other structures in the knee have sustained severe damage, or specifically when there is: * Concurrent osteochondral injury * Continued gross instability * Palpable disruption of the medial patellofemoral ligament and the vastus medialis obliquus * High-level athletic demands coupled with mechanical risk factors and an initial injury mechanism not related to contact Supplements like glucosamine and NSAIDs can be used to minimize bothersome symptoms. ===Rehabilitation=== An effective rehabilitation program reduces the chances of re-injury and of other knee-related problems such as patellofemoral pain syndrome and osteoarthritis. Most patella dislocations are initially immobilized for the first 2‚Äì3 weeks to allow the stretched structures to heal. Rehabilitation focuses on maintaining strength and range of motion to reduce pain and maintain the health of the muscles and tissues around the knee joint. The objective to any good rehabilitation program is to reduce pain, swelling and stiffness as well as increase range of motion. A common rehabilitation plan is to strengthen both the hip abductors, hip external rotators and the quadricep muscles. Commonly used exercises include isometric quadricep sets, side lying clamshells, leg dips with internal tibial rotation, etc. The idea is that because the medial side is most often stretched by the more common lateral dislocation, medial strengthening will add more stabilizing support. With progression more intense range of motion exercises are incorporated. == Epidemiology == Rate in the United States are estimated 2.3 per 100,000 per year. Rates for ages 10‚Äì17 were found to be about 29 per 100,000 persons per year, while the adult population average for this type of injury ranged between 5.8 and 7.0 per 100,000 persons per year. The highest rates of patellar dislocation were found in the youngest age groups, while the rates declined with increasing ages. Females are more susceptible to patellar dislocation. Race is a significant factor for this injury, where Hispanics, African-Americans and Caucasians had slightly higher rates of patellar dislocation due to the types of athletic activity involved in: basketball (18.2%), soccer (6.9%), and football (6.9%), according to Brian Waterman. Lateral Patellar dislocation is common among the child population. Some studies suggest that the annual patellar dislocation rate in children is 43/100,000. The treatment of the skeletally immature is controversial due to the fact that they are so young and are still growing. Surgery is recommended by some experts in order to repair the medial structures early, while others recommend treating it non operatively with physical therapy. If re-dislocation occurs then reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is the recommended surgical option. == References  External links == * University of Connecticut: New England Musculoskeletal Institute ‚Äì site concerning knee injury treatment options Category:Sports medicine Category:Dislocations, sprains and strains Category:Patella Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Patellar dislocation"},{"id":"20177123","text":"District DF-IV shaded blue The Fourth Federal Electoral District of the Federal District (IV Distrito Electoral Federal del Distrito Federal) is one of the 300 Electoral Districts into which Mexico is divided for the purpose of elections to the federal Chamber of Deputies and one of 27 such districts in the Federal District (\\"DF\\" or Mexico City).

It is most actively developed in behavioral science in general and the field of behavior analysis and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the Association for Contextual Behavioral Science). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as relational frame theoryHayes, S.C.; Barnes-Holmes, D. & Roche, B. (Eds.). (2001). Relational Frame Theory: A Post- Skinnerian account of human language and cognition. New York: Plenum Press. and its most prominent application, acceptance and commitment therapy.Hayes, S.C.; Strosahl, K. & Wilson, K.G. (1999). Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: An experiential approach to behavior change. New York: Guilford Press. It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of B.F. Skinner's radical behaviorism first delineated by Steven C. Hayes which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context. ==Contextualism== The form of contextualism from which functional contextualism emerged is the one described by the philosopher Stephen C. Pepper in his book World Hypotheses: A Study in Evidence.Pepper, S.C. (1942). World hypotheses: A study in evidence. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press. In this work, Pepper noted that philosophical systems tend to cluster around a few distinct \\"world hypotheses\\" or \\"world views\\". Each world view is characterized by a distinctive underlying root metaphor and truth criterion. Root metaphors are based on seemingly well- understood, common-sense, everyday objects or ideas, and serve as the basic analogy by which an analyst attempts to understand the world. A world view's root metaphor roughly corresponds to its ontological assumptions, or views about the nature of being or existence (e.g., whether the universe is deterministic or not). Truth criteria are inextricably linked to their root metaphors, and provide the basis for evaluating the validity of analyses. A world view's truth criterion roughly corresponds to its epistemological assumptions, or views about the nature of knowledge and truth (e.g., whether it is discovered or constructed). The root metaphor of contextualism is the \\"act in context\\", whereby any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context. The truth criterion of contextualism is often dubbed \\"successful working\\", whereby the truth and meaning of an idea lies in its function or utility, not in how well it is said to mirror reality. In contextualism, an analysis is said to be true or valid insofar it as it leads to effective action, or achievement of some goal. Contextualism is Pepper's term for the philosophical pragmatism developed by Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, John Dewey, and others. ===Varieties of contextualism=== Analytic goals are vitally important to the contextualistic world view. This is because the analytic tools of contextualism‚Äîits root metaphor and truth criterion‚Äîboth hinge on the purpose of the analysis, and neither can be mounted effectively without a clearly specified analytic goal. The pragmatic truth criterion of \\"successful working\\" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because \\"success\\" can only be measured in relation to the achievement of some objective.Dewey, J. (1953). Essays in experimental logic. New York: Dover (Original work published 1916) Likewise, the root metaphor of the \\"act-in-context\\" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because there would be no basis on which to restrict the analysis to a subset of the infinite expanse of the act's historical and environmental context.Gifford, E.V. & Hayes, S.C. (1999). Functional contextualism: A pragmatic philosophy for behavioral science. In W. O'Donohue & R. Kitchener (Eds.), Handbook of behaviorism (pp. 285‚Äì327). San Diego: Academic Press. Without a clear analytic goal, the contextualist could analyze the endless context of an act in perpetuity, without ever knowing when the analysis was complete or good enough to be deemed \\"true\\" or \\"useful\\". It is very difficult for a contextualist without an explicit goal to construct or share knowledge. Contextualists can, and do, adopt different analytic goals, and the many different varieties of contextualism can be distinguished by their goals.Hayes, S.C. (1993). Analytic goals and the varieties of scientific contextualism. In S.C. Hayes, L.J. Hayes, H.W. Reese & T.R. Sarbin (Eds.), Varieties of scientific contextualism (pp. 11‚Äì27). Reno, NV: Context Press. Based on their overarching analytic goals, contextualistic theories can be divided into two general categories: \\"descriptive contextualism\\" and \\"functional contextualism\\". Descriptive contextualism Descriptive contextualists seek to understand the complexity and richness of a whole event through a personal and aesthetic appreciation of its participants and features. This approach reveals a strong adherence to the root metaphor of contextualism and can be likened to the enterprise of history, in which stories of the past are constructed in an attempt to understand whole events. The knowledge constructed by the descriptive contextualist is personal, ephemeral, specific, and spatiotemporally restricted.Morris, E.K. (1993). Contextualism, historiography, and the history of behavior analysis. In S.C. Hayes, L.J. Hayes, H.W. Reese & T.R. Sarbin (Eds.), Varieties of scientific contextualism (pp. 137-165). Reno, NV: Context Press. Like a historical narrative, it is knowledge that reflects an in-depth personal understanding of a particular event that occurred (or is occurring) at a particular time and place. Most forms of contextualism, including social constructionism, dramaturgy, hermeneutics, and narrative approaches, are instances of descriptive contextualism. Functional contextualism Functional contextualists, on the other hand, seek to predict and influence events using empirically based concepts and rules. This approach reveals a strong adherence to contextualism's extremely practical truth criterion and can be likened to the enterprise of science or engineering, in which general rules and principles are used to predict and influence events. Rules or theories that do not contribute to the achievement of one's practical goals are ignored or rejected. Knowledge constructed by the functional contextualist is general, abstract, and spatiotemporally unrestricted.Fox, E. J. (2006). Constructing a pragmatic science of learning and instruction with functional contextualism. Educational Technology Research & Development, 54 (1), 5-36. Like a scientific principle, it is knowledge that is likely to be applicable to all (or many) similar such events, regardless of time or place. ==References== Category:Behavioural sciences Category:Epistemology Category:Philosophy of science Category:Pragmatism Category:Behaviorism ","title":"Functional contextualism"},{"id":"20177407","text":"Jashore University of Science and Technology () also known as JUST () is a government-financed public university in Bangladesh.

She was elected to the House of Representatives as a list MP for the National Party in the 2008 election. she is the National Party's spokesperson for broadcasting, communications, digital media, and ethnic affairs. ==Early life and career== Lee was born in South Korea and grew up in Malaysia before moving to Australia and then to New Zealand in 1988 with her family. She has a MA Hons (First Class) in Communication Studies. Based in Auckland, she spent twenty three years in journalism, including a five-year stint at the Sunday News and writing for numerous publications including The New Zealand Herald and The Listener. She was also the producer of the TV magazine series, Asia Downunder. ==Member of Parliament== In November 2008, Lee became a List MP in the New Zealand Parliament. Her maiden speech included sections in English, MƒÅori, and Korean. In English, she mentioned crime, education, and anti-Asian racism issues in New Zealand. In the MƒÅori section, she mentioned the history of MƒÅori first coming to New Zealand by canoe from Hawaiki and compared it to her own migration to New Zealand by aeroplane. Near the end of her speech, she thanked, in Korean, all the people that had given her support \\"simply by virtue of [their] shared heritage\\". Lee became the second Korean, and first Korean woman, to win election to a non-Korean national legislature. (The first Korean elected to a foreign national-level office, Jay Kim, became a member of the United States House of Representatives in 1992.) A poll conducted between 10 December 2008 and 19 April 2009 by the Spanish newspaper, 20 minutos (20 minutes) ranked Lee as the world's 51st most beautiful female politician. ===First term and Mt Albert by-election, 2008-2011=== During the first months of entering Parliament two Conscience votes were taken, Melissa Lee voted against the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal Cannabis) Amendment Bill and the Liquor Advertising (Television and Radio) Bill. On 16 April 2009, Lee announced her candidacy for the National Party nomination in the 2009 Mount Albert by- election. She defeated the previous local National candidate, Ravi Musuku, to win selection for the National Party on 4 May 2009. On 13 May 2009 Lee told a candidates' meeting that the SH20 Waterview Connection could divert criminals from South Auckland away from the electorate. Lee apologised the next day, saying \\"if South Auckland people (find) my comments offensive, I apologise. It wasn't about them. It was about criminals.\\" Prime Minister John Key later said the remark was a \\"stupid statement to make\\". Later that day she apologised again saying, \\"I apologise unreservedly for the comments I made regarding South Auckland... I sincerely regret my remarks.\\" In the by-election, Lee attracted only 3,542 votes, coming a distant second to Labour's David Shearer's 13,260 votes. During the by-election, allegations were made in May 2009 that Lee's production company Asia Vision had spent New Zealand on Air money making a promotional video for the National Party ahead of the 2008 election. Lee called the allegations \\"ridiculous\\", saying that all work on the video was done by volunteers. The Green Party referred the video to the Electoral Commission, saying that it should have been declared as an election expense. An investigation conducted by New Zealand on Air later cleared Lee of the charge of misuse of funding. Later in 2009 Lee used NZ$100,000 of contingency funding to increase the markup for Asia Downunder in violation of her contract with New Zealand on Air, which she described as \\"an innocent error\\". In April 2011 Lee courted controversy when, after she had made a speech supporting the controversially rushed-through copyright law 92A, it emerged that hours earlier she had tweeted \\"Ok. Shower... Reading ... And then bed! listening to a compilation a friend did for me of K Pop. Fab. Thanks Jay\\" which appeared to contradict her stance on law 92A. ===Second term, 2011-2014=== During the 2011 general election, Melissa Lee increased her electoral vote in the Mt Albert electorate but failed to unseat David Shearer, who retained the seat by a margin of 10,021 votes. On 20 December 2011 John Key announced that Lee and John Hayes would become Parliamentary Private Secretaries, a role not in use for several years. Key appointed her to the portfolio of Ethnic Affairs, given the heavy workload of Judith Collins as the newly appointed Minister of Justice. In January 2014, Lee was appointed Chairperson of the Social Services Select Committee. There were several conscience votes during the 50th Parliament surrounding issues of the legal alcohol purchase age and Same-Sex Marriage. In these votes Lee voted against the Marriage (Definition of Marriage) Amendment Act 2013 and voted in favour of retaining the Alcohol Purchase age at 18 in the Alcohol Reform Bill. ===Third term, 2014-2017=== During the 2014 general election, Melissa Lee failed to win the Mt Albert electorate. Her Labour opponent David Shearer retained the seat by 10,656 votes, a moderate decrease on the previous election but substantially increased the party vote, winning the party vote by 3536. After the 2014 election, Lee was appointed to Chair the Commerce Select Committee while also retaining her position as Parliamentary Private Secretary for Ethnic Communities, the position being renamed to reflect the change in name of the eponymous Ministry and Minister, Lee has been joined by Jacqui Dean as a Parliamentary Private Secretary since the retirement of John Hayes at the 2014 Election. Lee also has one Private Members Bill waiting to be drawn from the ballot: the Accident Compensation (Recent Migrants and Returning New Zealanders) Amendment Bill. ===Fourth term, 2017-present=== During the 2017 general election in mid-September 2017, Melissa Lee was re- elected on the National Party List. Lee stood against Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern in the Mt Albert electorate but was defeated by a margin of 15,264 votes. Following the formation of a Labour-led coalition government on 19 October 2017, the National Party became the main opposition party in Parliament. Lee is currently the National Party's spokesperson for broadcasting, communications, and digital media, and ethnic communities. She is also a member of the Economic Development, Science and Innovation select committee. In March 2018, Lee challenged the Broadcasting Minister Clare Curran about her undisclosed meeting with Carol Hirschfield, the head of content at Radio New Zealand. Curran initially claimed the meeting had been coincidental but later admitted that it had been prearranged. Lee accused Curran of engaging in a cover-up. In mid September 2019, Lee raised the issue in Parliament about Asian children being denied measles vaccinations at their local clinic on the pretext that MƒÅori and Pacific children were being given priority. In response, the Waikato District Health Board acknowledged that it was prioritizing Maori and Pacific children due to their lower vaccination rate and poorer health outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand in mid-July 2020, Lee raised the plight of Dowook Kang, a six-year old Korean child who was unable to attend school since his father, a temporary visa holder, was unable to return to New Zealand due to lockdown travel restrictions.

Ekkehard II was educated by his uncle and the monk Geraldus, who educated also his other nephews, Notker Physicus and Burkard, later abbot of the monastery. Ekkehard II likewise became a teacher at the monastery school. A number of his pupils joined the order; others became bishops. About 973 Dowager Duchess Hadwig of Swabia, the widow of Duke Burchard III called Ekkehard II to her seat at Hohentwiel Castle. Hadwig, a member of the Imperial Ottonian dynasty, was wont occasionally to visit St. Gall, and eventually asked for and obtained the services of Ekkehard as her tutor in the reading of the Latin classics. Nevertheless, he continued to render great services to his monastery, especially on the occasion of the differences between Saint Gall and the nearby Reichenau Monastery under Abbott Ruodmann; in many other ways also Ekkehard proved himself useful to the monks by the influence he had obtained as tutor of the duchess. Ekkehard, erudite and eloquent, also socialised at the court of Emperor Otto I. Later he became provost of Mainz Cathedral, where he died in 990. He was buried in the church of St. Alban, outside the city gates. Ekkehard was the author of various ecclesiastical hymns, known as sequences, all of which are lost, except one (Summis conatibus nunc) in honour of Saint Desiderius. The attribution of several other works is uncertain. ==Reception== Ekkehard's life was perpetuated by the Saint Gall monk Ekkehard IV, when he continued the ' chronicles begun by Ratpert of St. Gallen. His records were the basis for the 1855 historic novel Ekkehard by Joseph Victor von Scheffel, which became hugely successful. Johann Joseph Abert's 1878 opera Ekkehard is based on Scheffel's book.

The Terrapins and Cavaliers first met in 1919 and the series has been played annually without interruption since 1957, although the series' future is in doubt beyond 2013 because of Maryland leaving the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for the Big Ten Conference in 2014. Maryland leads the series 44‚Äì32‚Äì2, although Virginia is 15‚Äì7 since 1991. Maryland possesses the longest winning streak of the series, sixteen games between 1972 and 1987, while Virginia has the second longest streak with nine consecutive wins ending in 2000. The schools jointly announced a home-home series in 2017 that would be played during the 2023 and 2024 seasons. ==BackgroundContributing factors=== Maryland lines up against Virginia in Charlottesville in 2008. Maryland was held scoreless in the game, losing 31‚Äì0. Several factors contribute to the intensity of the rivalry. The two states, and their eponymous flagship universities based in Charlottesville, Virginia and College Park, Maryland, respectively, share close historical and cultural ties. The schools are located in relatively close geographic proximity, separated by about . Due in large part to this proximity, the schools aggressively compete for recruits in the Mid-Atlantic region.Eric Prisbell, No Common Ground; They Battle for Position in the ACC. They Compete for Recruits. Most of All, Maryland and Virginia Fight Just to Beat Each Other, The Washington Post, November 13, 2003. Former Maryland coach Ralph Friedgen expressed the importance of the rivalry by stating, \\"It's a potential rivalry in every sport we play. They're border states. We compete for students, not just athletes.\\"Rick Snider, Maryland, Virginia seeking KO punch, The Washington Times, November 13, 2003. The two are both long-time members of the Atlantic Coast Conference, with Maryland becoming a founding member in 1953 and Virginia joining later in that same year. When the conference reorganized in 2005, Maryland and Virginia were placed in separate divisions, but designated as cross-divisional rivals that continue to meet annually. The intensity of the rivalry is increased by a long history in the series of comebacks, shutouts, and spoilers that prevented one team from securing a conference championship or bowl game appearance. From the 1920s until 1945, the teams competed for the Tydings Trophy, named for former politician and Maryland alum Millard Tydings who had several friends amongst the professors at Virginia. In 2003, the schools discussed reviving the trophy tradition, but it was ultimately rejected by Virginia, due to concerns over the reorganization of the ACC. Before and after their meeting in 2010, players from both schools attributed the importance of the game to the negative feelings the programs have for each other. Virginia center Anthony Mihota said \\"I guess it's because we don't like them very much. Something about them that gets under our skin\\". After Maryland's victory, Terp linebacker Adrian Moten commented, \\"This was a big win in the rivalry. They hate us. We hate them.\\" The high academic standing of the University of Virginia in a national publication has added to the competitiveness between the two. In 2003, University of Maryland president C.D. Mote asserted that, in academic terms, Virginia was \\"highly overrated these days ... U.S. News & World Report places them at the top of the pile with Berkeley, which is ridiculous.\\" Mote further stated that students from the state of Maryland paying a higher tuition cost to attend the University of Virginia \\"don‚Äôt know any better.\\"Doug Doughty, Cavs, Terrapins a textbook rivalry, The Roanoke Times, November 14, 2003. While the University of Virginia president, John Casteen, said such remarks can be taken out of context, Virginia board of visitors member, William H. Goodwin, responded in The Cavalier Daily, \\"I certainly think a college president should have more class, but you have to expect that from Maryland.\\" ===Relative importance=== Former Virginia head coach Al Groh stopped short of calling the game with Maryland a 'rivalry', but said that \\"it is a very important game to our team and it is our annual game. So that certainly designates it as being different from the other games.\\"Eric Prisbell, Groh on ACC Teleconference, Terrapins Insider, The Washington Post, October 1, 2008. Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen conceded that \\"[Virginia has] Virginia Tech as an in-state rivalry, but I think we're their out-of-state rivalry.\\" Maryland‚ÄìVirginia is the second most played out-of-state rivalry for Virginia, after the longest standing rivalry in the ACC, the South's Oldest Rivalry between Virginia and North Carolina. It is the fourth most played for the Cavaliers overall, after North Carolina, Virginia Tech (Commonwealth Cup), and Virginia Military Institute. In contrast, Maryland‚ÄìVirginia is the most-played historical series for Maryland. ==Noteworthy games1945=== Maryland 19, Virginia 13 In 1945, the two teams met for a neutral site match-up at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C. Head coach Frank Murray, a future Hall of Fame inductee, had led 13th-ranked Virginia to a perfect 7‚Äì0 record. The Cavaliers also held an undefeated streak of fourteen games. Bear Bryant was in his only year as Maryland's head coach. Maryland's Sam Behr broke away for a 90-yard touchdown run, but Virginia held the lead in the fourth quarter.The Terrapin, Class of 1946, University of Maryland yearbook, p. 175‚Äì176.

After this game, the series went on hiatus for 11 years, and it was the last year the Tydings Trophy was awarded. ===1961=== Virginia 28, Maryland 16 Tom Nugent's Terps entered their last season game boasting a 7‚Äì2 record that included a win over seventh-ranked Syracuse with Heisman Trophy-winner Ernie Davis and the only victory over Penn State until 2014. They faced a Virginia team that started off their season by breaking a three-year, 28-game losing streak against William & Mary. The Cavaliers had lost the last three meetings against Maryland by an average of 38 points. With a win against Virginia, the Terps would secure the ACC title and a trip to the Gator Bowl. After Maryland scored for an early lead, Virginia quarterback Gary Cuozzo tossed three short touchdown passes to third-string receiver John Hepler. Defensive back Ted Rzempoluch returned an interception 95 yards for a touchdown, and sealed the Terps' fate to go bowl-less. The other three-loss team in the ACC, Duke, won the conference.Mervin Hyman, Football's Week, Sports Illustrated, December 4, 1961, retrieved November 14, 2008. ===1988=== Virginia 24, Maryland 23 In the final minutes of the game, with the Terps trailing the Cavaliers 24‚Äì17, Maryland quarterback Neil O'Donnell was injured and taken out of the game. He was replaced by a young second-stringer Scott Zolak. Zolak led a drive which culminated with a three-yard option run for a touchdown narrowing the deficit to a point. With 1:09 left in the game, Maryland went for two. Zolak threw into the endzone to running back Ricky Johnson. Johnson appeared to catch the ball before being hit by defensive back Keith McMeans, knocking the ball loose. An official in the endzone immediately signaled for a catch, before others waved it as incomplete. After the game, the usually level-headed Terps head coach Joe Krivak ran to the official who made the initial call, following him to the locker room, and then ran over to yell at referee Don Safrit. Several witnesses claim he said to the officials that \\"If it takes every ounce of energy, I'm going to get you out of this league.\\"Terrapins Cry Foul; Virginia's 24‚Äì23 Victory Controversial, The Washington Post, November 20, 1988.

However, the Cavaliers failed to secure a bowl game berth, while N.C.

George Welsh's eighth-ranked Virginia (8‚Äì1) had spent three weeks atop the AP poll at number-one until a loss against Georgia Tech. At halftime, Maryland trailed 21‚Äì7. Then freshman reserve running back Mark Mason put the Terps back in the game with a 59-yard touchdown breakaway, and a team best run for the year. Maryland quarterback Scott Zolak threw for two more touchdowns and Mason scored the go-ahead with an 8-yard rush to put the Terps ahead 35‚Äì30.

Maryland needed to beat Virginia to finish with a winning season and likely secure a berth in the Aloha Bowl or Oahu Bowl. At the end of the first quarter, Virginia led 17‚Äì0. Maryland's freshman quarterback Latrez Harrison was pulled and replaced by former safety Randall Jones. Jones along with Heisman prospect running back LaMont Jordan led the Terps to tie it at 17 before halftime. In the third quarter, Jordan ran 90 yards to make it 24‚Äì17, but the Cavaliers tied it soon after. With 5:18 left, Terps kicker Brian Kopka made a field goal to make it 30‚Äì27. In the next series, Virginia went for it on fourth down but a Dan Ellis pass was incomplete. The Terps took over on downs with 1:40 left. Victory seemed assured, but Maryland failed to convert a first down and the inexperienced Randall Jones ran out of bounds on third down, which stopped the clock when Virginia had no time-outs. The Cavaliers got the ball on their own 24-yard line. In nine plays and just 46 seconds, Dan Ellis led a 76-yard drive that culminated with a touchdown pass to Billy McMullen to win the game with 26 seconds left. The 34‚Äì30 loss dashed the Terrapins' hopes for their first bowl game since 1990.David Ginsburg, Cavs rally to knock off Terps, 34‚Äì30 , AP Sports, University of Maryland, November 20, 1999, retrieved November 16, 2008. After the game, Maryland coach Ron Vanderlinden remarked \\"Devastating. The worst loss I've ever been associated with because of what was on the line.\\" ===2002=== Virginia 48, Maryland 13 After Terps head coach Ralph Friedgen stated Maryland expected to \\"beat teams like Duke and Virginia\\", the Cavs sought vindication for the comparison to ACC football's perpetual underdog. While Maryland's Scott McBrien passed for a touchdown in the first series, Virginia went on to score 20 unanswered points in the second quarter with two Matt Schaub passes and two field goals. In the second half, the Cavaliers delivered four more touchdowns: another Schaub pass, a pass by receiver Billy McMullen, and two short rushing scores. The Terps only managed to use Nick Novak to make two field goals. The loss broke Maryland's eight- game winning streak, and prevented them from sharing a piece of the ACC championship. Instead, Florida State finished with a better conference record (7‚Äì1), and secured the title outright.Schaub throws three TDs, Lundy scores three in upset, ESPN, November 23, 2002, retrieved November 15, 2008. ===2003=== Maryland 27, Virginia 17 With leading rusher Bruce Perry out due to a sprained ankle, Terps running back Josh Allen adeptly filled in, and racked up 257 yards and two touchdowns. Virginia quarterback Matt Schaub threw for a touchdown and ran for another, but his second-half comeback attempt ultimately fell short. In the game, Schaub overtook Shawn Moore's career passing record at the school. There was also some excitement even before the game started. Maryland assistant coach James Franklin and Virginia head coach Al Groh had a heated exchange after a Cavaliers player interrupted the Terps' warm up drills. Then, after Virginia won the coin toss, Al Groh infamously elected to kick off to start both halves. Immediately after the decision, the entire Maryland team rushed the field in celebration and was given a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty before the opening kickoff. The win kept the Terps' ACC title hopes alive, but Florida State narrowly beat N.C. State 50‚Äì44 to win the conference outright.

Cavaliers punt returner Emmanuel Byers muffed a third-quarter punt to give Maryland possession on the Virginia one-yard line. Lance Ball rushed for a touchdown on the next play, and the Terps went on to score another 21 points in the final quarter to include a 56-yard breakaway by Keon Lattimore and a 45-yard pick-six by linebacker Erin Henderson. With 2:37 left on the clock, the Cavaliers responded with a 44-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Ogletree, to pull to 28‚Äì26. Virginia attempted a two-point conversion to send the game into overtime.

The game ended when, with 16 seconds left, Simpson dived into the endzone as the ball was knocked out of his hands. It was ruled a touchdown and Virginia defeated Maryland. Terps coach Ralph Friedgen said \\"I saw the ball come out on the goal line. I saw it and I don't think he had possession.\\" Simpson himself stated, \\"It crossed the line. I knew I scored because I looked down and saw the yellow line and I saw the ball cross [before] they hit it out.\\" With the victory, the Cavaliers reached seven wins in a row for the first time since 1990 and for only the fourth time in school history.

The company went out of business on the 1st of April 2018, reeling from the Obama administration's Department of Energy decision in January 2016 to pass it over for a $80 million grant, instead giving the money to a consortium led by Bill Gates and X-energy. ==Revised 2009 design: uranium nitride fueled, lead-bismuth cooled reactor== Hyperion announced in November 2009 that, despite their continued intentions to pursue the self-moderated uranium hydride reactor, urgent customer needs for a rapidly licenseable and deployable reactor are causing them to choose another LANL design for initial commercialization. They are moving forward with a more conventional Generation IV reactor design: a uranium nitride fueled, lead- bismuth cooled reactor. Using a liquid-metal-cooled fast reactor should speed the time to commercialization over the more revolutionary uranium hydride, self-moderating design that had previously been publicly discussed.Hyperion launches U2N3-fuelled, Pb-Bi-cooled fast reactor , 20 November 2009, Nuclear Engineering International USNRC concept illustration of a Hyperion Power Module plant. Hyperion Power Module (HPM), Nuclear Regulatory Commission filing February 10, 2010, accessed 2010-03-10. ===Fuel and Coolant Selection=== According to Hyperion, the uranium nitride fuel incorporated in the design is generally similar in physical characteristics and neutronics to the standard ceramic uranium oxide fuel that is used at present in modern light water nuclear reactors. However, it has certain beneficial traits - higher thermal conductivity - and thus less retained heat energy - that make it preferable over oxide fuels when used at temperature regimes that are greater than the temperatures found in light water reactors. By operating at higher temperatures, steam plants can operate at a higher thermal efficiency. The presentation by Hyperion at the ANS 2009 conference mentions the use of the Doppler inherent negative temperature coefficient of reactivity in this reactor as a means of control. Nuclear scientist Alexander Sesonske avers that nitride fuels have both received very little development (as of 1973) and seem to have a very favorable combination of physical properties - especially in fast reactors. Whether this carries over to lead-bismuth cooled reactors is a question not answered in the reviewed literature, though the Soviet Union has worked with this type of reactor before in naval service; in particular, the Alfa class submarine - well known in the West for its high speed operation - was driven by such a lead-bismuth reactor which is known to have worked very effectively. The Hyperion module has sufficient fuel for 3650 full power days at 70 MWth, is capable of load following, and is meant to be built in pairs; one module can be at power, while another can be under installation or uninstallation at the same time, ensuring reliable supply of electricity. ===Thermal Hydraulics, Energy Production and Extraction=== Hyperion plans to use natural circulation of the lead-bismuth coolant through the reactor module as a means of primary cooling. Coolant temperatures within the primary loop should be approximately . Powered intermediate heat exchangers, also using lead-bismuth coolant, are located within the reactor and run an intermediate loop going to a third ex-reactor heat exchanger (the steam generator), where heat is transferred to the working fluid, heating it to approximately . Two schemes of power generation exist at this point: either using superheated steam or supercritical carbon dioxide to drive Rankine cycle or Brayton cycle turbines. In addition to the classical use of power generation, further uses for the heated working fluid can include desalinization, process heat, and district heating and cooling. The thermal hydraulics of the lead-bismuth reactor are dictated by the high heat capacity and unique properties of the lead-bismuth eutectic coolant. This coolant has several extremely beneficial properties for a reactor: it is opaque to gamma radiation, but transparent to neutron flux; it melts easily at a low temperature, but does not boil until an extremely high temperature is reached; it does not greatly expand or contract when exposed to heat or cold; it has a high heat capacity; it will naturally circulate through the reactor core without pumps being required - whether during normal operation or as a means of residual decay heat removal; and it will solidify once decay heat from a used reactor has dropped to a low level. ===Licensing Strategy=== Hyperion intends to pursue the licensing of the uranium nitride, lead-bismuth small reactor with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), though the firm's deployment schedule (the target date for deployment was for the end of 2013) as well as indications from senior personnel within Hyperion indicates that perhaps the reactor will bypass the normal lengthy NRC process for commercial reactors and will instead be initially deployed by the U.S. Department of Energy or the U.S. Department of Defense, not subject to NRC regulation, or that Hyperion will seek a 10CFR50.21 Class 104 Research and Development reactor license from the NRC. Hyperion expects to apply to the NRC for regulatory approval \\"within a year.\\"Small Nuclear Reactors Are Becoming Big Business: The race is on to develop refrigerator-size reactors that could power small towns or plants, Business Week, 2010-05020, accessed 2010-05-24. Possibilities for manufacture in nations other than the United States have also been mentioned as a way to overcome the NRC's lesser agility in responding to the commercial introduction of unique and innovative features of this reactor design. In particular, Hyperion plans to manufacture reactors in the United Kingdom, which has demonstrated recent national leadership in the field of nuclear energy, while a yet to be announced nation in Asia is targeted for manufacture as well. == Current Competing Designs == See List of small nuclear reactor designs * NuScale * Toshiba 4S * mPower by Babcock & Wilcox Company * TerraPower ==References * About Gen4 Energy link no longer valid Category:Nuclear reactors Category:Nuclear power companies of the United States Category:Nuclear energy in the United States ","title":"Gen4 Energy"},{"id":"20177533","text":"Ronald Lee Davini (born May 5, 1947) was a catcher who is most notable for winning the 1967 College World Series Most Outstanding Player award while a junior at Arizona State University. He is one of five players from Arizona State University to win that award. The others are Sal Bando, John Dolinsek, Bob Horner and Stan Holmes. Prior to playing collegiately, he attended Anaheim High School. He was also a Western Athletic Conference All-Star twice (in 1967 and 1968). ==Draft== He was drafted four times by big league teams. The first time, he was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 20th round of the 1965 amateur draft. He refused that. In 1967, he was drafted in the third round by the New York Yankees. He refused that as well. In 1968, was drafted in the seventh round by the Cleveland Indians, but once again, he refused to sign. Finally, after being drafted by the White Sox again in the first round (20th overall) of the 1969 draft, he did sign. Although he played professionally for five years, he never made it to the majors. ==Professional baseball career== In his first year of professional baseball, 1969, he played for the Duluth‚ÄìSuperior Dukes.

Notice how the back of the patient's left atrium and great vessels are left in place). Heart transplantation is performed on patients with end-stage heart failure or severe coronary artery disease. The most common procedure is to take a working heart from a recently deceased organ donor (allograft) and implant it into the patient. The patient's own heart may either be removed (orthotopic procedure) or, less commonly, left in to support the donor heart (heterotopic procedure). It is also possible to take a heart from another species (xenograft), or implant a man-made artificial one, although the outcome of these two procedures has been less successful in comparison to the far more commonly performed allografts. ===Lung=== While lung transplants carry certain associated risks, they can also extend life expectancy and enhance the quality of life for end-stage pulmonary patients. While the precise details of surgery will depend on the exact type of transplant, there are many steps which are common to all of these procedures. Prior to operating on the recipient, the transplant surgeon inspects the donor lung(s) for signs of damage or disease. If the lung or lungs are approved, then the recipient is connected to an IV line and various monitoring equipment, including pulse oximetry. The patient will be given general anesthesia, and a machine will breathe for him or her. It takes about one hour for the pre-operative preparation of the patient. A single lung transplant takes about four to eight hours, while a double lung transplant takes about six to twelve hours to complete. A history of prior chest surgery may complicate the procedure and require additional time. ===Heart-lung=== A heart-lung transplant is a procedure carried out to replace both heart and lungs in a single operation. Due to a shortage of suitable donors, it is a rare procedure; only about a hundred such transplants are performed each year in the United States. The patient is anesthetised. When the donor organs arrive, they are checked for fitness; if any organs show signs of damage, they are discarded and the operation cancelled. In order to avoid removal of recipient organs when donor organs are not viable, it is standard procedure that the patient is not operated on until the donor organs arrive and are judged suitable, despite the time delay this involves. Once suitable donor organs are present, the surgeon makes an incision starting above and finishing below the sternum, cutting all the way to the bone. The skin edges are retracted to expose the sternum. Using a bone saw, the sternum is cut down the middle. Rib spreaders are inserted in the cut, and spread the ribs to give access to the heart and lungs of the patient. The patient is connected to a heart-lung machine, which circulates and oxygenates blood. The surgeon removes the failing heart and lungs. Most surgeons endeavour to cut blood vessels as close as possible to the heart to leave room for trimming, especially if the donor heart is of a different size than the original organ. The donor heart and lungs are positioned and sewn into place. As the donor organs warm up to body temperature, the lungs begin to inflate. The heart may fibrillate at first - this occurs because the cardiac muscle fibres are not contracting synchronously. Internal paddles can be used to apply a small electric shock to the heart to restore proper rhythm. Once the donor organs are functioning normally, the heart-lung machine is withdrawn, and the chest is closed. ===Kidney=== inferior of the normal anatomical location. Kidney transplantation is the organ transplant of a kidney in a patient with end-stage renal disease. Kidney transplantation is typically classified as deceased-donor (formerly known as cadaveric) or living-donor transplantation depending on the source of the recipient organ. Living-donor renal transplants are further characterized as genetically related (living-related) or non-related (living-unrelated) transplants, depending on whether a biological relationship exists between the donor and recipient. ===Liver=== Liver transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with a healthy liver allograft. The most commonly used technique is orthotopic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and the donor organ is placed in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation nowadays is a well accepted treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. ===Pancreas=== A pancreas transplant involves implanting a healthy pancreas (one that can produce insulin) into a person who has diabetes. Because the pancreas performs functions necessary in the digestion process, the recipient's native pancreas is left in place, and the donated pancreas attached in a different location. In the event of rejection of the new pancreas, the recipient could not survive without the native pancreas still in place. The healthy pancreas comes from a donor who has just died or it may be a partial pancreas from a living donor.Type 1 cures - pancreas transplants Whole pancreas transplants from living donors are not possible, again because the pancreas is a necessary organ for digestion. At present, pancreas transplants are usually performed in persons with insulin- dependent diabetes who have severe complications. ===Intestine=== Small intestine transplantation is the rarest type of solid organ transplant. Currently, approximately half are pediatric recipients. View Data Reports > National Data > Transplant, Intestine, & Transplant by Recipient Age Retrieved on 1, October 2010 The most common indications in adults are ischemia (22%), Crohn's disease (13%), trauma (12%), and desmoid tumor (10%); and in pediatrics, gastroschisis (21%), volvulus (18%), and necrotizing enterocolitis (12%). Higher graft and patient survival rates are seen at the more experienced transplant programs. Within the last few years, 1-year graft and patient survival at more experienced centers have reached 60% to 70% and 65% to 80%, respectively. Retrieved on 1, October 2010 ===Face=== A face transplant is a still-experimental procedure. In addition to skin, the transplant optimally includes bones, along with muscle, skin, blood vessels and nerves. ==Main tissues and cellsCornea=== Cornea transplant. Corneal transplantation is a surgical procedure where a damaged or diseased cornea is replaced by donated corneal tissue which has been removed from a recently deceased individual having no known diseases which might affect the viability of the donated tissue. The cornea is the clear part of eye in front of the iris and pupil. The surgical procedure is performed by ophthalmologists, medical doctors who specialize in eyes, and are often done on an outpatient basis (the patient goes home following surgery). ===Skin=== flaps, performed by Sir Harold Gillies in 1917. Before (left) and after (right) the operation. Skin grafting is often used to treat: *Extensive wounding or trauma *Burns *Areas of prior infection with extensive skin loss *Specific surgeries that may require skin grafts for healing to occur Skin grafts are often employed after serious injuries when some of the body's skin is damaged. Surgical removal (excision or debridement) of the damaged skin is followed by skin grafting. The grafting serves two purposes: it can reduce the course of treatment needed (and time in the hospital), and it can improve the function and appearance of the area of the body which receives the skin graft. ===Hematopoietic stem cells (bone marrow)=== Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the transplantation of blood stem cells derived from the bone marrow (that is, bone marrow transplantation) or blood. Stem cell transplantation is a medical procedure in the fields of hematology and oncology, most often performed for people with diseases of the blood, bone marrow, or certain types of cancer. Stem cell transplantation was pioneered using bone-marrow-derived stem cells by a team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center from the 1950s through the 1970s led by E. Donnall Thomas, whose work was later recognized with a Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. Thomas' work showed that bone marrow cells infused intravenously could repopulate the bone marrow and produce new blood cells. His work also reduced the likelihood of developing a life-threatening complication called graft- versus-host disease. The first physician to perform a successful human bone marrow transplant was Robert A. Good. With the availability of the stem cell growth factors GM-CSF and G-CSF, most hematopoietic stem cell transplantation procedures are now performed using stem cells collected from the peripheral blood, rather than from the bone marrow. Collecting peripheral blood stem cells provides a bigger graft, does not require that the donor be subjected to general anesthesia to collect the graft, results in a shorter time to engraftment, and may provide for a lower long-term relapse rate. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains a risky procedure with many possible complications; it has traditionally been reserved for patients with life- threatening diseases. While occasionally used experimentally in nonmalignant and nonhematologic indications such as severe disabling auto-immune disease and cardiovascular disease, the risk of fatal complications appears too high to gain wider acceptance. ===Blood=== Blood transfusion is the process of transferring blood or blood-based products from one person into the circulatory system of another. Blood transfusions can be life-saving in some situations, such as massive blood loss due to trauma, or can be used to replace blood lost during surgery. Blood transfusions may also be used to treat a severe anaemia or thrombocytopenia caused by a blood disease. People suffering from hemophilia or sickle-cell disease may require frequent blood transfusions. Early transfusions used Whole Blood, but modern medical practice is to use only components of the blood. ==Other organsHands=== The operation is carried out in the following order: bone fixation, tendon repair, artery repair, nerve repair, then vein repair. The operation typically lasts 8 to 12 hours. By comparison, a typical heart transplant operation lasts 6 to 8 hours. The recipient of a hand transplant needs to take immunosuppressive drugs, as the body's natural immune system will try to reject, or destroy, the hand. These drugs cause the recipient to have a weak immune system and suffer severely even from minor infections. In 2008, surgeons in Munich transplanted two whole arms. The long-term results remain to be seen. According to legend, in the third century AD, Saints Cosmas and Damian miraculously transplanted the black leg of a dead slave onto an elderly servant. ===Leg=== In ischiopagic conjoined twins, a healthy leg was transplanted from a dying conjoined twin to her sister. There is no need for immunosuppression because of the identical genetic make-up of the donor and recipient. The first leg transplant between genetically different people was performed in 2011, led by surgeon Pedro Cavadas. The procedure provided two legs to a double amputee, and recovery went well for about eight months. By then the man was able to stand up in a swimming pool. However, due to an unrelated illness, immunosuppressants had to be stopped, and the legs consequently needed to be amputated. ===Penis=== The penis may be an allograft from a human donor, or it may be grown artificially, though the latter is untested in humans. ===Bone=== Bone grafting is a surgical procedure that replaces missing bone with material from the patient's own body, an artificial, synthetic, or natural substitute. Bone grafting is used to repair bone fractures that are extremely complex, pose a significant health risk to the patient, or fail to heal properly. ===Uterus=== A uterine transplant is the replacement of a uterus which has undergone necrosis. Though the procedure has significant potential, it has been performed only a few times. ===Thymus=== Thymus transplantation can be used to treat infants with DiGeorge syndrome, which results in an absent or hypoplastic thymus, in turn causing problems with the immune system's T-cell mediated response. It is exclusively used in people with complete DiGeorge anomaly, which are entirely athymic. This subgroup represents less than 1% of DiGeorge syndrome patients. ==Other cells and tissuesIslets of Langerhans=== Islet cell transplantation has the possibility of restoring beta cells and curing diabetes. The Chicago Project headed at University of Illinois at Chicago Medical Center is investigating ways to regenerate beta cells in vivo. With that being said, beta cells experience apoptosis early and thus are destroyed within a normal-functioning pancreas. The source of this seems to come from the transfer of Pander, a gene that works by attaching to RNA. Pander, when active, causes the beta cells to be blocked at S phase, which induces apoptosis. This loss of beta cell mass eventually leads to a loss of most of the transplanted beta cells. ===Heart valve=== Biological valves are valves of animals, like pigs, which undergo several chemical procedures in order to make them suitable for implantation in the human heart. The porcine (or pig) heart is most similar to the human heart, and therefore represents the best anatomical fit for replacement. Implantation of a porcine valve is a type of Xenotransplantation, or Xenograft, which means a transplant from one species (in this case a pig) to another. There are some risks associated with a Xenograft such as the human body's tendency to reject foreign material. Medication can be used to retard this effect, but is not always successful. ===Ovary=== Ovary transplantation, giving rise to successful pregnancies, will result in children who will have the genetic inheritance of the organ donor and not the recipient; it has so far only been carried out on identical twins. Use of an ovarian transplant from a genetically identical donor prevents rejection of the donated organ. This bypasses the need for immune suppressants to maintain the function of the donated ovary, which is not vital for survival.Woman to give birth after first ovary transplant pregnancy by James Randerson, science correspondent. guardian.co.uk, Sunday November 9, 2008 12.52 GMT. More significantly, many immunosuppressants, such as mycophenolate mofetil, may cause birth defects. Lili Elbe received an ovary transplant in the early 1930s, followed by a uterus transplant, but died shortly thereafter from complications.Vaia Tsolas, Christine Anzieu-Premmereur, A Psychoanalytic Exploration of the Body in Today's World: On The Body (2017, ), page 234. ==See also== *Organ transplant ==References== Category:Transplantation medicine ","title":"Transplantable organs and tissues"},{"id":"20177556","text":"The Mel languages are a branch of Niger‚ÄìCongo languages spoken in Guinea- Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.

Such frequencies are known as the system's antiresonant frequencies, and at these frequencies the oscillation amplitude can drop to almost zero. Antiresonances are caused by destructive interference, for example between an external driving force and interaction with another oscillator. Antiresonances can occur in all types of coupled oscillator systems, including mechanical, acoustical, electromagnetic, and quantum systems. They have important applications in the characterization of complicated coupled systems. The term antiresonance is used in electrical engineering for a form of resonance in a single oscillator with similar effects. ==Antiresonance in electrical engineering== In electrical engineering, antiresonance is the condition for which the reactance vanishes and the impedance of an electrical circuit is very high, approaching infinity. In an electric circuit consisting of a capacitor and an inductor in parallel, antiresonance occurs when the alternating current line voltage and the resultant current are in phase. Under these conditions the line current is very small because of the high electrical impedance of the parallel circuit at antiresonance. The branch currents are almost equal in magnitude and opposite in phase. ==Antiresonance in coupled oscillators== Steady-state amplitude and phase of two coupled harmonic oscillators as a function of frequency. The simplest system in which antiresonance arises is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators, for example pendula or RLC circuits. Consider two harmonic oscillators coupled together with strength and with one oscillator driven by an oscillating external force . The situation is described by the coupled ordinary differential equations :\\\\begin{align} \\\\ddot{x}_1 + 2\\\\gamma_1 \\\\dot{x}_1 - 2g \\\\omega_1 x_2 + \\\\omega_1^2 x_1 &= 2F\\\\cos\\\\omega t \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ddot{x}_2 + 2\\\\gamma_2 \\\\dot{x}_2 - 2g \\\\omega_2 x_1 + \\\\omega_2^2 x_2 &= 0 \\\\end{align} where the represent the resonance frequencies of the two oscillators and the their damping rates. Changing variables to the complex parameters: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\alpha_1 &= \\\\omega_1 x_1 + i\\\\frac{p_1}{m_1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha_2 &= \\\\omega_2 x_2 + i\\\\frac{p_2}{m_1} \\\\end{align} allows us to write these as first-order equations: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{\\\\alpha}_1 &= i\\\\omega_1 \\\\alpha_1 - \\\\gamma_1(\\\\alpha_1 - \\\\alpha_1^*) - ig\\\\tfrac{\\\\omega_1}{\\\\omega_2}(\\\\alpha_2 + \\\\alpha_2^*) + iF(e^{i\\\\omega t}+e^{-i\\\\omega t}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{\\\\alpha}_2 &= i\\\\omega_2 \\\\alpha_2 - \\\\gamma_2(\\\\alpha_2 - \\\\alpha_2^*) - ig\\\\tfrac{\\\\omega_2}{\\\\omega_1}(\\\\alpha_1 + \\\\alpha_1^*) \\\\end{align} We transform to a frame rotating at the driving frequency :\\\\alpha_i \\\\rightarrow \\\\alpha_i e^{-i\\\\omega t} yielding :\\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{\\\\alpha}_1 &= i\\\\Delta_1 \\\\alpha_1 - \\\\gamma_1(\\\\alpha_1 - \\\\alpha_1^* e^{2i\\\\omega t}) - ig\\\\tfrac{\\\\omega_1}{\\\\omega_2}(\\\\alpha_2 + \\\\alpha_2^* e^{2i\\\\omega t}) + iF(1+e^{2i\\\\omega t}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{\\\\alpha}_2 &= i\\\\Delta_2 \\\\alpha_2 - \\\\gamma_2(\\\\alpha_2 - \\\\alpha_2^* e^{2i\\\\omega t}) - ig\\\\tfrac{\\\\omega_2}{\\\\omega_1}(\\\\alpha_1 + \\\\alpha_1^* e^{2i\\\\omega t}) \\\\end{align} where we have introduced the detunings between the drive and the oscillators' resonance frequencies. Finally, we make a rotating wave approximation, neglecting the fast counter-rotating terms proportional to , which average to zero over the timescales we are interested in (this approximation assumes that , which is reasonable for small frequency ranges around the resonances). Thus we obtain: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\dot{\\\\alpha}_1 &= i (\\\\Delta_1 + i\\\\gamma_1) \\\\alpha_1 - ig\\\\tfrac{\\\\omega_1}{\\\\omega_2}\\\\alpha_2 + iF \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dot{\\\\alpha}_2 &= i (\\\\Delta_2 + i\\\\gamma_2) \\\\alpha_2 - ig\\\\tfrac{\\\\omega_2}{\\\\omega_1}\\\\alpha_1 \\\\end{align} Without damping, driving or coupling, the solutions to these equations are: :\\\\alpha_i(t) = \\\\alpha_i(0) e^{i\\\\Delta t} which represent a rotation in the complex plane with angular frequency . The steady-state solution can be found by setting , which gives: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\alpha_{1,ss} &= \\\\frac{-F(\\\\Delta_2 + i\\\\gamma_2)}{(\\\\Delta_1 + i\\\\gamma_1)(\\\\Delta_2 + i\\\\gamma_2)-g^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\alpha_{2,ss} &= \\\\frac{\\\\omega_2}{\\\\omega_1}\\\\dfrac{-Fg}{(\\\\Delta_1+ i\\\\gamma_1)(\\\\Delta_2 + i\\\\gamma_2)-g^2} \\\\end{align} Examining these steady state solutions as a function of driving frequency, it is evident that both oscillators display resonances (peaks in amplitude accompanied by positive phase shifts) at the two normal mode frequencies. In addition, the driven oscillator displays a pronounced dip in amplitude between the normal modes which is accompanied by a negative phase shift. This is the antiresonance. Note that there is no antiresonance in the undriven oscillator's spectrum; although its amplitude has a minimum between the normal modes, there is no pronounced dip or negative phase shift. ==Interpretation as destructive interference== Animation showing time evolution to the antiresonant steady- state of two coupled pendula. The red arrow represents a driving force acting on the left pendulum. The reduced oscillation amplitude at an antiresonance can be regarded as due to destructive interference or cancellation of forces acting on the oscillator. In the above example, at the antiresonance frequency the external driving force acting on oscillator 1 cancels the force acting via the coupling to oscillator 2, causing oscillator 1 to remain almost stationary. ==Complicated coupled systems== Example frequency-response function of a dynamical system with several degrees of freedom, showing distinct resonance-antiresonance behavior in both amplitude and phase. The frequency response function (FRF) of any linear dynamic system composed of many coupled components will in general display distinctive resonance- antiresonance behavior when driven. As a rule of thumb, it can be stated that as the distance between the driven component and the measured component increases, the number of antiresonances in the FRF decreases. For example, in the two-oscillator situation above, the FRF of the undriven oscillator displayed no antiresonance. Resonances and antiresonances only alternate continuously in the FRF of the driven component itself. ==Applications== An important result in the theory of antiresonances is that they can be interpreted as the resonances of the system fixed at the excitation point. This can be seen in the pendulum animation above: the steady-state antiresonant situation is the same as if the left pendulum were fixed and could not oscillate. An important corollary of this result is that the antiresonances of a system are independent of the properties of the driven oscillator; that is, they do not change if the resonance frequency or damping coefficient of the driven oscillator are altered. This result makes antiresonances useful in characterizing complex coupled systems which cannot be easily separated into their constituent components. The resonance frequencies of the system depend on the properties of all components and their couplings, and are independent of which is driven. The antiresonances, on the other hand, are dependent upon the component being driven, therefore providing information about how it affects the total system. By driving each component in turn, information about all of the individual subsystems can be obtained, despite the couplings between them. This technique has applications in mechanical engineering, structural analysis, and the design of integrated quantum circuits.

He spent the better part of his career at Athletic Bilbao, appearing in 320 matches across all competitions since making his debut with the first team at the age of 19. Iturraspe won two caps for Spain, in 2014. ==Club careerAthletic Bilbao=== Born in Abadi√±o, Biscay, Iturraspe joined Athletic Bilbao in 1999, at the age of 10. He spent several seasons in the various junior levels of the club and, in 2007, moved to farm team CD Basconia in the fourth division. On 12 March 2008, Iturraspe started for the first team in a 6‚Äì1 friendly win against Zalla UC. Towards the end of the league campaign, he also played in exhibition matches with Club Portugalete and Aviron Bayonnais FC. On 23 June 2008, Iturraspe was officially promoted to the main squad, being issued with the squad number 26. On 14 September he made his La Liga debut, starting in a 0‚Äì0 draw at M√°laga CF in the same match as another youth graduate, Mikel Balenziaga; his second appearance came as a substitute, in the 2‚Äì0 home win over Real Valladolid. Iturraspe made his second start for Athletic in a Copa del Rey match against Recreativo de Huelva, being replaced at half-time by Pablo Orbaiz. He continued appearing almost exclusively for the reserves until the end of the season, however. Benefitting from physical problems to veteran Carlos Gurpegui, Iturraspe played in nearly 60 official games in 2011‚Äì12 under new manager Marcelo Bielsa. Athletic reached both the UEFA Europa League and the domestic cup finals. At the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season, he was voted into the La Liga Team of the Year by the reporters of the Liga de F√∫tbol Profesional. In early 2019, it was announced that Iturraspe would leave Athletic at the end of the campaign when his contract ended. The club's final home match involved tributes to him, as well as fellow long-serving squad members Mikel Rico and Markel Susaeta who were also departing in similar circumstances. ===Espanyol=== On 8 July 2019, Iturraspe signed a one-year contract with RCD Espanyol as a free agent. He made his debut on 1 August in the second leg of the second qualifying round in the UEFA Europa League, as a 65th-minute substitute in a 3‚Äì1 win at Stjarnan (7‚Äì1 aggregate). He did not feature for the Barcelona-based club until 15 December, again off the bench in a 2‚Äì2 home draw against Real Betis. ==International career== Following a strong 2013‚Äì14 season, Iturraspe was called up by Spanish national team manager Vicente Del Bosque to his 30-man provisional squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, making his debut on 30 May in a friendly with Bolivia in Seville where he played the full 90 minutes (2‚Äì0 win). However, the following day, he was omitted from the final list. ==Personal life== Iturraspe's younger brother, Gorka, also came through Athletic's academy and became a professional in the same position. ==Career statisticsClub=== {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2Cup !colspan=2Europe !colspan=2OtherIncludes other competitive competitions, including the Supercopa de Espa√±a, UEFA Super Cup, FIFA Club World Cup. !colspan=2Total - !DivisionAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoalsAppsGoals - Basconia 2007‚Äì08 Tercera Divisi√≥n 301colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì301 - rowspan=4Bilbao Athletic 2007‚Äì08 rowspan=3Segunda Divisi√≥n B 30colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì30 - 2008‚Äì09 261colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì261 - 2009‚Äì10 110colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì110 - !colspan=2Total !401colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì401 - rowspan=12Athletic Bilbao 2008‚Äì09 rowspan=11La Liga 4010colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì50 - 2009‚Äì10 150003010190 - 2010‚Äì11 17010colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì180 - 2011‚Äì12 35180150colspan=2‚Äì581 - 2012‚Äì13 3002090colspan=2‚Äì410 - 2013‚Äì14 3305000colspan=2‚Äì380 - 2014‚Äì15 2526070colspan=2‚Äì382 - 2015‚Äì16 1604080colspan=2‚Äì280 - 2016‚Äì17 2403050colspan=2‚Äì320 - 2017‚Äì18 3001070colspan=2‚Äì380 - 2018‚Äì19 3020colspan=2‚Äìcolspan=2‚Äì50 - !colspan=2Total !2323330540103203 - !colspan=3Career total !3025330540103825 } ===International=== {   !colspan=3Spain - !YearAppsGoals - 201420 - !Total20 } ==HonoursClub=== Athletic Bilbao *Copa del Rey runner-up: 2008‚Äì09, 2011‚Äì12, 2014‚Äì15 *Supercopa de Espa√±a runner-up: 2009 *UEFA Europa League runner-up: 2011‚Äì12 ===Individual=== *La Liga Team of the Year: 2013‚Äì14 ==References* Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:People from Abadi√±o Category:Sportspeople from Biscay Category:Spanish footballers Category:Basque footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi√≥n B players Category:Tercera Divisi√≥n players Category:CD Basconia footballers Category:Bilbao Athletic footballers Category:Athletic Bilbao footballers Category:RCD Espanyol footballers Category:Spain under-23 international footballers Category:Spain international footballers Category:Basque Country international footballers ","title":"Ander Iturraspe"},{"id":"20177637","text":"Ke-mo sah-bee (; often spelled kemo sabe, kemosabe or kimosabe) is the term used by the fictional Native American sidekick Tonto as the Indian name for The Lone Ranger in the American television and radio programs The Lone Ranger. It has become a common catchphrase. Ultimately derived from gimoozaabi, an Ojibwe and Potawatomi word that may mean \\"he/she looks out in secret\\", it is sometimes translated as \\"trusty scout\\" (the very first Lone Ranger TV episode, 1941) or \\"faithful friend\\". In the 2013 film The Lone Ranger, Tonto states that it means \\"wrong brother\\" in Comanche, a seemingly tongue-in-cheek translation within the context of the plot. ==Meaning and origin== Jim Jewell, director of The Lone Ranger from 1933 to 1939, took the phrase from Kamp Kee- Mo Sah-Bee, a boys' camp on Mullett Lake in Michigan, established by Charles W. Yeager (Jewell's father-in-law) in 1916. Yeager himself probably took the term from Ernest Thompson Seton, one of the founders of the Boy Scouts of America, who had given the meaning \\"scout runner\\" to Kee-mo-sah'-bee in his 1912 book \\"The Book of Woodcraft and Indian Lore\\". Kamp Kee-Mo Sah-Bee was in an area inhabited by the Ottawa, who speak a language which is mutually comprehensible with Ojibwe. John D. Nichols and Earl Nyholm's A Concise Dictionary of Minnesota Ojibwe defines the Ojibwe word giimoozaabi as \\"he peeks\\" (and, in theory, \\"he who peeks\\"), making use of the prefix giimoo(j)-, \\"secretly\\"; Rob Malouf, now an associate professor of linguistics at San Diego State University, suggested that \\"giimoozaabi\\" may indeed have also meant scout (i.e., \\"one who sneaks\\"). ==Other uses== * Featured in the lyrics of \\"Apache (Jump on It)\\", a 1981 song by The Sugarhill Gang.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKhi9ITkRgA ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Jay Silverheels biography: TONTO: The Man in Front of the Mask Category:Lone Ranger Category:Catchphrases Category:Quotations from radio Category:Quotations from television Category:Words and phrases introduced in the 1930s ","title":"Ke-mo sah-bee"},{"id":"20177656","text":"Sveti Lenart (; Leksikon obƒçin kraljestev in de≈æel zastopanih v dr≈æavnem zboru, vol. 6: Kranjsko. 1906.

Schmidt, who later changed their name to Smith. After the death of his mother in his teens, Smith and family moved to West De Pere, Wisconsin, to live with their paternal grandparents. ==Education== Smith graduated from high school in West De Pere in 1923. A year later, he entered Lawrence College in Appleton, Wisconsin, where he received a B.A. degree in 1928. He applied for a fellowship at the University of Michigan and began graduate studies in botany in the fall of 1928 with the eminent mycologist Calvin H. Kauffman as his advisor. Kauffman died before Smith completed his degree, so he continued his studies under professor Edwin Butterworth Mains, eventually earning his M.A. in 1929 and his Ph.D. in 1933. His doctoral dissertation was entitled \\"Investigations of Two-spored Forms in the Genus Mycena\\", which was later published as a journal article. ==Career== In 1934 he was appointed assistant curator at the University of Michigan Herbarium, where he was to spend his entire professional career. He was appointed director of the Herbarium in 1959 and served in that capacity until 1972. In 1968, he served as deputy director of the Biological Station. Smith married fellow graduate student Helen Vendler Smith, who received her Ph.D. in botany at the University of Michigan. They would work together later, she co-authoring and illustrating some of his publications. Daughter Nancy, born in 1943, would accompany her parents on mycological expeditions and forays. Following in her parents' footsteps, she also completed a doctorate at the University of Michigan, in mycology. Smith was president of the Mycological Society of America, and from 1945 to 1950 served as editor of the scientific journal Mycologia in 1950. He was president of the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts, and Letters, the Michigan Academy (1966‚Äì67), the Michigan Botanical Club, the Torrey Botanical Club, and the Research Club of the University of Michigan in 1974‚Äì75. Smith taught formal courses at the University in Ann Arbor in addition to summer field courses at the University of Michigan Biological Station at Douglas Lake, Michigan. Additionally, he supervised nine Ph.D. graduate students, some of whom, such as Harry D. Thiers and Orson K. Miller, would become recognized mycologists in their own right. During the course of 57 years of field work, Smith accumulated over 100,000 collections of fungal samples, and an extensive library of photographs. Today these are located in the University of Michigan Herbarium. ==High standards== Smith maintained high scientific standards in his publications; he once wrote > I personally feel that as mycologists we can never arrive at truly accurate > generic concepts and correct names for them unless the pertinent facts are > accurately stated. It is next to impossible to avoid bias in taxonomic work, > but information should be \\"slanted\\" as little as possible. Other contemporary authors that did not meet these standards would often suffer censure by Smith in book reviews or articles. For example, in a book review about a then-recent publication on wood-decay fungi, he wrote: > In a work of this type the author should have recognized his duty to give > his readers and users the best of modern classifications and nomenclature. > In this respect he failed completely. ...The agaric part of the work is full > of contradictions based on the author's failure to consider work of the last > 30 years.\\" Later he writes > Perhaps the best that can be said for the work editorially is that > fortunately there is very little introductory material to confuse the > reader.\\" In another article, commenting about \\"the current low degree of accuracy developing in the literature on hallucinogenic mushrooms generally\\", Smith pointed out numerous errors in two current publications, such as ambiguously written text, mistakes in citations, lack of scientific rigor in presenting arguments, unreliability of data due to inadequate sampling procedures, and inadequate searches of available literature. Smith would soon collaborate with one of these authors in a publication the next year. == Publications == Smith published nearly 200 articles and books about fungi, including many books as monographs or various genera of higher fungi. He also wrote for the casual mushroom enthusiast; in particular, his field guide The Mushroom Hunter's Field Guide garnered several excellent reviews and sold over 100,000 copies.

The transhumant Fula, however, have spread with their languages from Senegal across the western and central Sahel. The most populous unitary language is Wolof, the national language of Senegal, with four million native speakers and millions more second-language users. There are perhaps 13 million speakers of the various varieties of Fula, and over a million speakers of Serer. The most prominent feature of the Senegambian languages is that they are devoid of tone, unlike the vast majority of Niger-Congo languages. ==Classification== David Sapir (1971) proposed a West Atlantic branch of the Niger‚ÄìCongo languages that included a Northern branch largely synonymous with Senegambian. However, Sapir's West Atlantic and its branches turned out to be geographic and typological rather than genealogical groups. The only investigation since then, Segerer & Pozdniakov (2010, 2017), removed the Southern Atlantic languages. The remaining (Northern or Senegambian) languages are characterized by a lack of tone. The Serer‚ÄìFulani‚ÄìWolof branch is characterized by consonant mutation. Serer and Fula share noun-class suffixes. The inclusion of the poorly attested Nalu languages is uncertain. Several classifications, including the one used by Ethnologue 20, show Fula as being more closely related to Wolof than it is to Serer, due to a copy error in the literature. ==Consonant mutation== The Senegambian languages are well known for their consonant mutation, a phenomenon in which the initial consonant of a word changes depending on its morphological and/or syntactic environment. In Fula, for example, the initial consonant of many nouns changes depending on whether it is singular or plural: :{  pul-lo  \\"Fulani person\\"  ful-…ìe  \\"Fulani people\\" -  guj-jo  \\"thief\\"  wuy-…ìe  \\"thieves\\" } ==Noun classes== The West Atlantic languages are defined by their noun-class systems, which are similar to those found in other Niger‚ÄìCongo languages, most famously the Bantu languages. Most West Atlantic, and indeed Niger‚ÄìCongo, noun-class systems are marked with prefixes, and linguists generally believe that this reflects the proto-Niger‚ÄìCongo system. The languages of the Fula‚ÄìSerer branch of Senegambian, however, have noun-class suffixes or combinations of prefixes and suffixes. Joseph Greenberg argued that the suffixed forms arose from independent postposed determiners that agreed with the noun class: :CL-Noun CL-Det -> CL-Noun-CL -> Noun-CL ==References== *Sapir, David. 1971. \\"West Atlantic: An Inventory of the Languages, Their Noun-class Systems and Consonant Alternation\\".

He recounted his exploits to author Ira Wolfert, who published them in the book American Guerrilla in the Philippines in 1945. A character based on Richardson was played by Tyrone Power in the 1950 film of the same name. ==BiographyEarly life=== Richardson was the only surviving child of Methodist Minister Royal Richardson, who died when Iliff was three years old. His mother Velma Weston Richardson taught Latin and music and raised Iliff in a variety of Colorado towns and her father's Nebraska ranch, located northwest of Springview, Nebraska. After his death, the Richardsons went to live in Los Angeles. Iliff studied at Compton Junior College, then travelled through Europe, the Near and Middle East, returning to the US before the fall of France in World War II. ===Wartime career=== In 1940, he was commissioned an ensign in the US Navy and was posted to the USS Bittern, a minesweeper in the Philippines.Wolfert, I., 1945, American Guerrilla in the Philippines, New York: Simon and Schuster He later transferred to Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three, commanded by John D. Bulkeley. Richardson was the executive officer of PT 34,Bulkley, Robert J., Kennedy, John F., Eller, Ernest MacNeill, At Close Quarters: PT Boats in the United States Navy, 2003 Naval Institute Press, p. 24 under Bob Kelly. PT-34 and PT-41 attacked the Japanese cruiser Kuma one night and then separated, PT-34 making its way back to Cebu City, where it was strafed by Japanese planes, setting it on fire. He then helped burn the town just before the Japanese arrived. Richardson then served with the US Army, setting off demolition charges in Cebu City.Smith, George W., MacArthur's Escape, 2005 Zenith, p. 239 When the Japanese captured General Chinowitz's headquarters, Richardson headed to Leyte, making it to Tacloban, and the headquarters of Col. Cornell. Making his way to Mindanao, he learned the Japanese had already taken Del Monte Airfield, so he returned to Leyte with 11 other Americans. With 400 pesos out of the 2000 the colonel gave him, Richardson purchased a single-masted banca and sail. Richardson and 11 other Americans, all Air Corps but two, attempted to sail the native outrigger to Australia against the summer southwest monsoon, but the boat was sunk by a storm on 18 May after only traveling 200 miles. Richardson and Pierson swam 8 miles to shore in 19 hours, where his men and he were rescued by Filipinos from a fishing village. The summer of 1942 was quiet for Richardson and the other Americans on Mindanao until September, when armed resistance against the Japanese started in Balingasag, Misamis Oriental. Richardson headed for Malitbog, the next year, hoping to see his girlfriend \\"Curly\\". Col. Morgan was there, working with Col. Wendell Fertig, to unify and organize the guerrillas before General MacArthur would recognize them. Richardson eventually joined the Philippine guerrilla forces of Ruperto Kangleon, and offered to establish contact with Col. Fertig on Mindanao. Richardson was successful in meeting Col. McLish's band of guerrillas, including many Americans such as Ed Dyess. McLish led Richardson to Fertig, in Misamis Occidental, where Richardson delivered Kangleon's letter. While there, Richardson met Chick Parsons and agreed to set up radio stations around Leyte and Samar, and provide intelligence on Japanese ship movements. Richardson rejoined Kangleon on 16 Aug., and became his chief of staff. He also quickly re-established the telegraph system for immediate communication of intelligence. Kangleon then moved his headquarters from Maasin to Don Lorenzo's Casa in Malitbog. Richardson was a former ham radio operator. He set up a radio station on Leyte, manned by Joseph St. John and Chapman, and a radio station on Samar, manned by Truman Heminway. In November 1943, under orders from Col. Fertig, Kangleon, Richardson, and other guerrilla leaders were in Mindanao to coordinate activities, and meet the submarine USS Narwhal delivering American aid. By Christmas 1943, Richardson had a master radio set operating to communicate with Mindanao. However, by then the Japanese had made the Casa, in Malitbog, their headquarters for southern Leyte. On February 1, 1944, Kangleon's forces went on the offensive, which included attacks on Japanese garrisons at Anahawan and Linoan, forcing the Japanese to not venture away from the coastal towns of southern Leyte. Richardson then assisted in the establishment of a weather station, manned by two submarine arrivals, including the son of Walter S. Gamertsfelder. Next, Richardson established a radio station on Samar and plotted the Surigao Strait mine field from Homonhon Island. By September 12, Richardson was operating a radio station near Balangiga, Eastern Samar. Richardson was picked up by a US destroyer during the Battle of Leyte, and transferred to the USS Nashville, where he met General MacArthur and General Kenney. For his work, Richardson was made a US Army Intelligence major by General Douglas MacArthur, holding commissions in the army and navy simultaneously. He is the only person to receive consecutive medals in both the Army and the Navy. When attempting to get his back pay, Richardson was told by a naval pay clerk that he was dead. After receiving his pay, Richardson was incorrectly thought to be drawing pay from both the Army and Navy. Richardson was given notices of four courts-martial in as many days. After telling Admiral Ernest King and others of his experiences, all charges were dropped and King personally apologized to him. Richardson was promoted to full lieutenant and made speeches across the United States. ===Memoirs=== After the liberation of the Philippines, Richardson transcribed his memoirs to Pulitzer Prize-winning war correspondent and author Ira Wolfert of the North American Newspaper Alliance. Wolfert turned it into a book, An American Guerrilla in the Philippines, which became both a Book-of-the-Month Club selection and a condensed book in the March 1945 Readers Digest. Darryl F. Zanuck of 20th Century Fox bought the film rights and had Lamar Trotti write a screenplay by August 1945. The end of the war led Zanuck to shelve all films with a World War II theme. It was eventually made five years after the end of the war. The name of the central character was changed to \\"Chuck Palmer\\" and he was given a fictional love-interest for dramatic purposes, but based on Richardson's girlfriend \\"Curly\\". ===Postwar career=== Following the war, Richardson married Coma Noel and lived in Houston, Texas, where he worked as a business executive, life insurance salesman, and a consultant, as well as acting as technical advisor for several Hollywood films. Richardson also attempted to manufacture and sell a single-shot slamfire \\"Philippine Guerrilla Gun\\" shotgun through his Richardson Industries in New Haven, Connecticut, that he set up in 1946. With a wide variety of shotguns brought back from Europe and American-manufactured weapons, it did not sell very well. Thomas F. Swearingen noted in his book World's Fighting Shotguns, \\"The American market would not tolerate such a primitive firearm, even as a curio.\\" Many years later, Richardson told a meeting of Eagle Scouts that he learned how to live as a guerrilla through his days in Los Angeles Boy Scout Troop 92. ==See also== * List of American guerrillas in the Philippines *Iliff David Richardson - Obituary in Los Angeles Times, 2001-Oct-23 [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-oct-23-me-60625-story.html} ==References== Category:1918 births Category:2001 deaths Category:United States Army officers Category:United States Navy officers Category:American army personnel of World War II Category:American naval personnel of World War II Category:American guerrillas of World War II Category:People associated with the Boy Scouts of America Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:United States Army personnel who were court-martialed Category:United States Navy personnel who were court-martialed ","title":"Iliff David Richardson"},{"id":"20177722","text":"The protagonists of the series. Clockwise from top, Amon, Robin Sena, Haruto Sakaki, Michael Lee, Yurika D≈çjima and Miho Karasuma. The anime series Witch Hunter Robin featured an extensive cast of fictional characters designed by Kumiko Takahashi. The series takes place on a fictional modern-day Earth where the Solomon organization fights the harmful use of witchcraft using a database of witches, those who have obtained the power of witchcraft through genetics, and those who carry the gene called \\"seeds\\" in order to arrest them or to employ Hunters, people who hunt witches, should their powers \\"awaken\\". The series' titular character is Robin Sena, a soft-spoken 15-year-old Hunter and witch with pyrokinetic abilities. She is sent to Solomon's Japanese branch, the STN-J. There she meets five other Hunters: Amon, Haruto Sakaki, Michael Lee, Miho Karasuma and Yurika D≈çjima. The antagonists include Takuma Zaizen, administrator of the STN-J. As the series progresses, Robin's witch power strengthens and she is hunted by the Solomon organization. == Main characters Robin Sena === is a soft-spoken 15-year-old Hunter and craft- user with pyrokinetic abilities. She was raised in a convent in Italy before she was sent to the STN-J to gather information for the Solomon administration. Her witch powers allow her to channel her energy into shields capable of blocking solid matter and crafts, magical powers. However, any use of her power temporarily weakens her eyesight, greatly reducing her accuracy and effectiveness. This problem is solved when she begins to wear glasses. Although she is good-natured, Robin employs her gift with lethal force when necessary to save a life or for the good of others. As the series progresses, her powers increase rapidly until she is labeled dangerous by Solomon and is ordered to be hunted as a witch. It is discovered that Robin is a \\"Designer Witch\\" and was created through \\"Project Robin\\", a genetic engineering project. Her mother, Maria, had agreed to genetic manipulation and called the unborn Robin \\"Hope.\\" Robin was designed to give birth to witch kind, what was once called \\"divinities\\" in ancient history. Robin was given thousands of years witch kind's memories, the origin of \\"craft\\". This enables her to understand the sadness arising from the conflict between humans and witches, in turn allowing her to find a way for humans and witches to peacefully coexist. Amon volunteers to be a watchman who will terminate her if she becomes destructive. She accepts this. After the collapse of the Factory, her fate is unknown. The reactions of the other characters show that she is believed to be alive, but is said to be dead for her own safety. However, after the ending credits it shows that a new hunter arrived at the STN-J, which is actually not a new hunter but Robin herself. === Amon === is a cold and serious 25-year-old S-class Hunter. He is asked by Zaizen to watch over Robin and he reluctantly does so. After seeing her worth in dealing with highly prominent witches, he accepts her. After an attack on the STN-J headquarters, he is no longer seen working under Zaizen and instead works for the Solomon headquarters. When he is ordered to kill Robin, Amon finds he cannot. Amon's father was a seed and his mother was a witch, indicating he carries the dormant witch trait. He fears the awakening of the gene. His fear and hatred of witches stems from the awakening of his mother as a witch, who no longer recognized him afterward. When Robin accepts her role as the one who will find a way for humans and witches to peacefully coexist, Amon volunteers to be a watchman who will terminate her if she becomes destructive. After the collapse of the Factory, his ultimate fate is unknown. However, the reactions of the other characters show that he is believed to be alive, but is said to be dead for his own safety. === Haruto Sakaki === is an 18-year-old Hunter. Haruto is supportive, but brash, slightly hot-tempered, and ambitious, often rushing into danger during hunts, producing regrettable results. He is the STN-J's newest member, after Robin, and is initially afraid of being replaced when she arrives. Despite this, he welcomes her. Although his exact condition is unknown, it is suggested he is an unawakened seed when he is hunted by Zaizen. At the series' conclusion, Sakaki is confirmed to be alive and still hunting witches. === Michael Lee === is the STN-J's hacker and technical support expert. When Zaizen catches him hacking into the STN-J computer network, Michael is given the option of working for the STN-J or being killed. Michael opted for the former and is confined to the STN-J headquarters building at all times. He is a skilled hacker and is able to locate extensive information, including witch profiles, police reports, without leaving a trace. Other characters do not maintain a relationship with him, save for a business-like relationship, and do not often interact with him. Michael, in turn, does not interact with them and avoids Robin. However, he begins to develop a relationship when she stays in the office at night to accompany him. At the series' conclusion, he is finally given permission to leave STN-J headquarters. === Miho Karasuma === is a 19-year-old hunter and craft-user. Her craft, psychometry, allows her to touch an object and read the strong emotions and thoughts a person had while holding it. Sometimes, she is able to see past events that happened to or around an item or place. Because of this, she is able to relay useful information while investigating a crime scene or examining evidence. She gives Robin advice on how to improve her control over her power and acts like a mentor. Despite her young age, Karasuma acts like a professional and is determined to get things done. At the series' conclusion, she replaces Amon as team leader and works hard to hunt down witches. === Yurika Dojima === is portrayed as carefree, lazy, vain and immature; she would sooner go shopping than go on a mission. She is consistently late for work and rarely does anything around the office. When she does do work, she does as little as possible and leaves as soon as she is finished. She tells Robin that her parents have authority over the STN-J and had the STN-J act as her \\"caretakers\\". D≈çjima does not warm up to Robin at first, mockingly calling her \\"Amon's Girl\\", but towards the end of the series she begins to take a liking for Robin, calling her \\"Little Robin\\". As the series progresses, she begins take more responsibility for her work and proves she has more insight and perception of her surroundings than originally presumed. She is revealed to be a Solomon intelligence operative, sent to the STN-J to uncover information about the Orbo. At the series' conclusion, she begins to take the task of hunting witches seriously. == Antagonists  Takuma Zaizen === is the administrator of the STN-J and the Factory and T≈çko's father. He sends captured witches to the Factory to transform their blood into the Orbo, a substance the STN-J Hunters use to stop witches. Zaizen is incinerated by Robin while he is escaping from an unsuccessful attempt on her life. == Other characters  Shintaro Kosaka === is a short-tempered man working directly under Zaizen. He updates Zaizen on the organization's progress as well as other related information. He is usually seen criticizing the employees while they are investigating a case or not doing work when he thinks they should. He constantly yells and scolds them, and he mostly fusses over his secretary and D≈çjima. Although he may be an annoyance to the rest of the Hunters, he shows some concern for them. Originally a member of the city police force, he possesses connections the hunters use when the STN-J are unavailable. At the series' conclusion, he is the STN-J's new administrator. === Shohei Hattori === is the secretary to Shintar≈ç Kosaka. === Master === , commonly called is the calm and polite proprietor of \\"Harry's\\", a cafe frequented by Robin and the rest of the series' main cast. His son, Yukata, is a witch and it is hinted that Master has \\"awakened\\" as well. He usually provides the Hunters with information that he manages to pick up from his customers. He takes a special interest in Robin, looking out for her and preparing food for her when she cannot come to the bar. Near the series' conclusion, he empathizes with her troubles and welcomes her \\"home.\\" === Toko Masaki === is Robin's roommate, and also Zaizen's daughter. She takes care of Robin until the raid at STN-J, and expresses interest in Robin by asking her several questions. She appears to have had a relationship with Amon, but he eventually decides to end the relationship. In the middle of the series, a group of assassins tie her up, duct tape her mouth shut, and use her as bait during an assassination attempt on Robin in her apartment. During the ensuing gun battle, she is shot in the back and critically injured. After the gun battle, Zaizen kicks Amon repeatedly, saying \\"your failure lead to this\\", suggesting Zaizen is the one who planned the attack, using his own daughter as bait. Others tell Robin that Toko's \\"physically recovered but the rest is mental\\", suggesting that Toko is having difficulty accepting what happened. She tells Zaizen to leave Amon alone, when Zaizen visits her in a hospital. === Shunji Nagira === is an attorney and is Amon's older half-brother by the same father. He takes Robin in after she leaves STN-J, and he runs a private office with two assistants. He has Robin act as a bike messenger, partly because he does not believe the government is correct in persecuting witches. Throughout whole episodes, Nagira does not do anything but investigate. He gathers information in the streets by means of a man he meets in a pachinko bar as well as a witch in Wall City. Personality-wise, he appears to be the opposite of his brother, as he is talkative, goofy, occasionally lazy, and tends to do things his way. === Grand Inquisitor Cortion === Grand InquisitorBonus content on the DVD explain that historically the church used Inquisitors to weed out heretics. Cortion is an Inquisitor sent from Solomon to perform an inquisition on the craft-user Shiro Masudo in the episode \\"The Eyes of Truth.\\" Karasuma explains to Sakaki that Solomon uses a human Inquisitor to make the final decision whether a craft-user/witch can be a hunter or not. Amon and Robin escort Cortion to the church he will be staying, and a discussion between the Inquisitor and Robin reveals that he performed Robin's Inquisition. As Cortion is leaving to return to HQ after the Inquisition, he tells Robin they will probably never meet again and alludes to the fact that she has awakened to \\"the pleasure of using her craft.\\" === Father Juliano Colegui === Father Juliano Colegui is a Roman Catholic priest and Robin's former guardian, he is also her maternal grandfather who raised her from birth. In the beginning of the series, Robin mentions that his powers have diminished, suggesting that he was once a craft user for Solomon, although it is never stated what his specific craft was. Since he and Robin are related, its probable that he was a fire craft user like Robin. He visits Robin in the latter part of the series to inform her about the events surrounding her past. During the times Robin stays with Nagira, he is the one who asks Amon to hunt Robin, for fear that she wouldn't be able to control her powers as they grew stronger. Later, in \\"Redemption Day\\" he confronts Robin himself, and sees that she has not changed, nor turned into the monster he feared her to be. He asks her forgiveness and blesses her, giving her the information taken from Todo's journal that will help her choose her path, and entrusts her to her own destiny, knowing she will choose the right actions. === Hiroshi Todo === Hiroshi Todo is Robin's \\"father\\", the brilliant scientist who designed her genes and artificially inseminated her within Maria. He researched a new project to repair the conflicts between humans and witches, however all evidence of his research was destroyed by Solomon because of the potential danger it contained, although it was far too late as the project had already reached its final stages. He entrusted Juliano with Robin's care, after Maria's death, gambling that Juliano would let her live. In the last episode, a recording of him is displayed on a computer in The Factory, explaining everything about his project, Robin's origins and potential, and the origins of Solomon's fear of witches (much to Zaizan's dismay). === Maria Colegui === Maria Colegui is the daughter of Father Juliano and is also Robin's mother, although not by a standard means of birth. She passed her power of pyrokinesis to Robin, stating that Robin is the \\"Hope\\" for the future of the well-being of all witches, as well as the key to solving the struggle of acceptance between witches and humans. After giving birth to Robin, Maria died. == Reception == The characters of Witch Hunter Robin have received praise and criticism from several publications for anime, manga, and other media. Zac Bertschy of Anime News Network notes that the character designs fit well with series' visual style and the characters' expression were convincing. Jason Bustard from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews comments that the characters are a \\"mixed bunch\\". The main cast is said to have \\"distinct and fully rendered personalities\\", all of which are well-done. Character interaction is fun, but characterization sometimes falls into clich√©. Tasha Robinson of Sci Fi Channel's Sci Fi Weekly commented that it was difficult to decide whom to \\"root for\\" as the witches seemed to be insane killers, but the protagonists were \\"killers of a colder, more controlled stripe\\" and were generally unpleasant, with the exceptions of Karasuma and Zaizen. She also says that the characters give no indication to why they work for the STN. Robin and Amon's character designs are said to be strange. == References == Witch Hunter Robin ","title":"List of Witch Hunter Robin characters"},{"id":"20177735","text":"First Comics is an American comic book company. ==Titles0‚Äì9=A=== *Alter Ego (4 issues) *American Flagg!

In 1913, at the age of 23, he formulated a thesis elucidating his philosophy of dramaturgy, Der beseelte und der psychologische Mensch [The Spiritual and the Psychological Person, also translated as The Inspired and the Psychological Being] and wrote the first draft of his most-renowned play, Die Verf√ºhrung [The Seduction]. His circle of young friends and compatriots included some of the most renowned German- speaking Jewish literary figures of the era, Oskar Baum, Max Brod, Rudolf Fuchs, Willy Haas, Franz Janowitz, Franz Kafka, Egon Erwin Kisch, Otto Pick, Hermann Ungar, Johannes Urzidil and Franz Werfel. In 1916, amidst the chaos of World War I and, with the ultimate birth of the future republic of Czechoslovakia only two years away, Kornfeld moved from Prague to Berlin where, during the Weimar period, he was to experience his most intense period of creativity. In 1918, during the final months of the war, he published a revised version of his thesis and oversaw the first production of Die Verf√ºhrung. An expressionist work, which put forth abstract and revisionist ideas, it attempted to encapsulate the universality of human aspiration. Character development and plot details were eschewed in favor of an atmosphere of hopeless inability to cope, which defeated the play's tragic protagonist. A subsequent expressionist drama, Himmel und Holle [Heaven and Hell] presented even more abstract ideas, but in a vein that was, to a greater degree, lyrical and ecstatic. Kornfeld also wrote satirical comedies which did not utilize expressionism and showed him in possession of a highly developed sense of humor. Der ewige Traum [The Eternal Dream] (1922), which held up a jaundiced mirror to reflect upon monogamous and polygamous relationships, Palme, oder Der Gekr√§nkte [Palme, or The Offended One] (1924), which spotlighted a character of comically extreme sensitivity and Kilian, oder Die gelbe Rose [Kilian, or The Yellow Rose] (1926), all enjoyed audience approval as did his collaboration with Max Reinhardt on a 1925 Berlin theatrical production. Written in 1929 and staged in 1930, his final Berlin play, Jud S√º√ü [Suss, the Jew, generally known under its literal translation, Jew Suss], presented a highly nuanced and objective portrayal of the controversial 18th century Jewish financier Joseph S√º√ü Oppenheimer whose story had already been depicted a century earlier in Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella and, again, only four years before his own work, in Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 historical novel. Within a decade, it also became the subject of a 1934 British film starring Conrad Veidt, and a notorious 1940 German anti-semitic propaganda film with Ferdinand Marian in the title role. ==Hitler era and death== Hitler's coming to power in 1933 put an end to Kornfeld's Berlin odyssey and forced him back to Prague, no longer a gathering hub of German-language culture but, since October 1918, the capital of the new republic of Czechoslovakia. His subsequent literary output greatly decreased and he began work on what turned out to be his only novel, Blanche oder Das Atelier im Garten [Blanche or The Studio in the Garden], which was not published until 1957, fifteen years after its author's death. Shortly after completing it in 1941, he was taken into custody by the German authorities administering occupied Prague and transported to Ghetto Litzmannstadt, the name given during the German occupation to a section of ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland's then-second-largest city. Between 1939 and 1944, over 200,000 Jews and a small number of Romani passed through the ghetto, an area of 4 sq. kilometers, of which only 2.4 kilometers were developed and habitable. Fuel supplies were extremely limited, and the inhabitants burned whatever they could to survive the harsh winter. Some 18,000 died during a famine in 1942, one of them Paul Kornfeld. He was 52 years old. Through the passing decades, his literary output has remained, for the most part, neglected, although a critical edition, Paul Kornfeld: Revolution mit Fl√∂tenmusik und andere kritische Prosa [Paul Kornfeld: Revolution with Flute Music and Other Critical Prose], was issued in 1977. ==Sources== *Johnston, William M.

He became a university professor in Spain and abroad. Maravall was head of the department at the University of La Laguna and the Complutense University of Madrid. He also became a member of the Real Academia de la Historia and the president of the Spanish Association of Historical Sciences. In Francoist Spain Maravall avoided some of the more politically sensitive topics of his work. He wrote poetry during this period, and co-founded the Nueva Revista (\\"New Magazine\\") literary review with Jos√© Antonio Mu√±oz Rojas and Leopoldo Panero. Maravall's work on Spanish history is considered foundational, and he is one of the highest authorities on the Old Regime of Monarchist Spain. In 1987, he received the National Essay Prize given by the Spanish Ministry of Culture. The University of Toulouse granted Maravall an honorary degree in recognition of his work.

The name FiveSprockets came from the five phases, or sprockets, of media production: (1) Story Development & Scriptwriting; (2) Pre-production; (3) Production; (4) Post-production; and (5) Marketing & Distribution. Founded in 2007 by CEO Randy Ullrich, FiveSprockets launched its Beta Release in September 2008 with an initial focus on social networking, educational content, and web-based software for screenwriting and production management. FiveSprockets: Your Virtual Production Studio. ==Ideas Module== FiveSprockets included an Ideas module where creators could store their raw ideas across several different Idea types (such as Story or Character). vScripter: Web- based story development and scriptwriting software. ==vScripter== vScripter was FiveSprockets' web-based story-development and scriptwriting software. vScripter took a story-development perspective on the process and allows the writer(s) to collect metadata about each story and manage their stories. vScripter supported a variety of different media-project formats, including screenplay, TV Sitcom, TV drama, Stage Play, Audio / Radio Play, and Comic Book. * Editor - vScripter's scriptwriting editor included features typical of scriptwriting software such as (a) proper formatting as recommended by AMPAS Nicholl Fellowship in Screenwriting; (b) writing accelerators such as intelligent tab-and-enter key processing; and (c) character and location memory for auto-completion typing. * Story Metadata - vScripter stored metadata about the story, including Log line, Tagline, Treatment, and story notes. * Collaboration - The script's originator could selectively choose to share a script in read-only or write-access mode to any of the originator's contacts. * Import/Export - Scripts written in other applications could be imported into vScripter via the RTF standard, which typically preserved most (but not necessarily all) of the original script's formatting. Additionally, vScripter could export to RTF, PDF, and HTML. * Script Registration - Through a partnership with ProtectRite, the creator and pioneer of online intellectual-property registration, writers could access the ProtectRite service directly from within vScripter to register and protect their work. vProductionOffice: Web-based production-management software. ==vProductionOffice== vProductionOffice was FiveSprockets' web-based production-management software. * Script Breakdown - When the user Greenlights a production, vProductionOffice walked the user through a simple wizard that, among other things, created a script breakdown. This includes separating the various scenes, listing the characters needed in each scene, and marking the 1/8's of each scene. The scenes could then be scheduled for their shooting date. *Storyboarding - The Storyboard feature allowed the user to create storyboards for each scene in the breakdown and watch the storyboard in an animation viewer. *Casting and Crewing - The user could cast and crew the production from their various connections within FiveSprockets. ==Job Board== FiveSprockets included a Job Board so that its users could seek out new collaborators across a variety of media-production roles, from \\"Above the Line\\" positions such as Actor, Director, and Producer, to \\"Below the Line\\" roles such as Line Producer, Script Supervisor, and Key Grip. Rich, entertainment-focused, user profiles. ==Social Networking & Community== FiveSprockets included social networking features such as user profiles, project showcasing, contact building, internal messaging, and discussion boards. FiveSprockets also included educational content and resources where users could share their knowledge and learn from others across content types like how-to videos, instructional guides, discussion forums, and glossary elements. ==Closure== On the 2nd of November 2012 the site shut down.

It was designed as a smaller and lower-cost replacement for the earlier DEC Computer Interconnect that would be more suitable for use in office environments. DSSI was superseded by Parallel SCSI. It was introduced in 1988 and has a bandwidth of 32 Mbit/s (4 MB/sec) and was typically limited to a length of . DSSI support was later extended to MIPS-based DECsystems and DEC Alpha-based AlphaServer systems. DSSI peripherals could be distinguished from narrow SCSI devices by their characteristic five conductor power connector featuring an extra lead intended for Battery/UPS connection to power critical components in the event of a power failure. == Characteristics == The major characteristics of the DSSI bus are: * Eight-bit data path * Up to eight nodes on the bus including variable numbers of initiators and targets * Distributed arbitration * Peak bandwidth of 4 megabytes per second * All systems connected to the same DSSI bus must have a common power/ground. * \\"The Q-Bus 5-Enclosure Rule\\": For Q-bus VMScluster configurations, a maximum of five enclosures, excluding SF200/210s, can be configured on a single DSSI bus. Note that only one (1) SF100 is allowed on any DSSI bus. * \\"The VAX 6000 Cabinet Rule\\": For a VAX 6000 DSSI VMScluster system, a maximum of two or three VAX 6000 systems and one storage cabinet, typically an SF200 or SF210, can be configured on a single DSSI bus. * Maximum DSSI bus length cannot exceed 27 meters (89 feet) and ground offset voltage cannot exceed 30mv (dc) or 10.5mv (rms). Bus Length Allowable Offset Meters/Feet (DC) (AC) \\\\----------- ---------------- up to 20/65 200mv 70mv (rms) 20-25/65-82 40mv 14mv (rms) VAX6000 QUAD-Host--> 27/89 30mv 10.5mv (rms) VAX7000 VAX10000 == Operating system support in VAX/OpenVMS == DSSI SUPPORT IN OpenVMS: OpenVMS VAX V5.0-2: o Single- and Dual-Host support with 2 EDA640s (MicroVAX 3300/3400 series). o Systems Communications Services (SCS) for the VMScluster is run over the Network Interconnect (NI) for MicroVAX 3300/3400. OpenVMS VAX V5.1: o Standalone support for the KFQSA. o Up to 6 ISEs on a single DSSI bus regardless of whether 1 or 2 hosts systems are attached to the bus. OpenVMS VAX V5.1-1: o Dual host support for KFQSAs (1 KFQSA per system). OpenVMS VAX V5.2: o For 3300/3400 series, SCS communication over the DSSI. o Multiple KFQSA's per system, but *not* multiple dual-hosted DSSI's per system (here, multiple means 2, since only 2 hosts are allowed on the DSSI bus). o DSSI adapter must connect to another like adapter, e.g. EDA640 to EDA640 or KFQSA to KFQSA. o Up to 7 ISEs on a single DSSI bus when only 1 host system is attached to the bus. OpenVMS VAX V5.3: o Mixed DSSI adapters, i.e. EDA640 to KFQSA. o Mixed DSSI adapters, i.e. EDA640 to KFQSA. o Double dual-host configurations, i.e. 2 DSSI buses between two CPUs. Each bus is terminated at its own pair of adapters. OpenVMS VAX V5.3-2: o Support for VAX 4000. (The VAX 4000 has 2 SHACs and can support two KFQSAs on the bus, so it can have up to 4 DSSI buses). OpenVMS VAX V5.4-2: o Support for the KFMSA, an XMI to DSSI adapter. The KFMSA may only be used to single-host a VAX 6000 model or dual- host 2 VAX 6000 models together. OpenVMS VAX V5.4-3: o Tri-host configurations supported. OpenVMS VAX V5.5-2: o Quad-host configurations with VAX 6000, VAX 7000/10000 series systems now supported. NOTE: KFQSAs do not support SCS communication over the DSSI bus, they MUST have a NI connection in order to run the cluster software. OpenVMS Alpha V1.5, OpenVMS VAX V6.0: o Quad-host DSSI configurations with DEC 4000 AXP systems supported. DEC 4000 systems can be configured only as end nodes on a DSSI bus, therefore, quad-host configurations must include at least two VAX systems. o KFQSA Q-bus to DSSI configurations supported. VAX processors that use the KFQSA adapter can be placed on the same DSSI bus as DEC 4000 processors. == Third Party Peripherals == Other companies, such as CMD and Symbios Logic made DSSI compatible chipsets or peripherals, for example, CMD manufactured various models of the CDI-4000 which would allow SCSI peripherals to be used on a DSSI bus. ==See also== * DSSI VAXcluster Installation and Troubleshooting manual, EK-410AB-MG *DEC Technical article: [ Ultrix ] How To Configure a kfqsa on a DECstation (sic) 5500 (DS5500), Last Technical Review: 6-SEP-1991 Size: 110 lines *DEC Technical article: [OpenVMS] Configuring RF Drives Connected To DSSI Adapter In A Cluster, Last Technical Review: 8-OCT-1996 Size: 332 lines *DEC Technical article: [OpenVMS] Guide To DSSI VAXcluster Configurations *DEC Technical article: How To Initialize An RF72 For High Speed Mode *DEC Technical article: [OpenVMS] Chart Overview Of Digital Disk Drive Storage Capacities *DEC Technical article: [PERFORMANCE] Disk Drive Performance Specifications *\\"OpenVMS Release Notes Addendum for VMScluster Systems\\", October 1993, (AA-Q1X7A-TE). *\\"Dual-Host MicroVAX Systems\\", VAXcluster Systems Quorum, February 1990, (EC-P0623-57), pp. 3‚Äì31. *\\"VAX 4000 Systems Info Sheet\\", (EC-F1424-41). *\\"VAX 6000 Systems Info Sheet\\", (EC-F1417-46). *\\"KFESA DSSI Adapter Installation and User's Guide\\", May 1994, EK-KFESA-OP.A01. *CDI-4000 DSSI to SCSI Adapter User's Manual, MAN-004000-000 ==References== Category:DEC hardware Category:Computer storage buses ","title":"Digital Storage Systems Interconnect"},{"id":"20177834","text":"Jos√© Luis Rocha represented M√©xico in the 1984 Olympic Games in Diving.

It mimics the effect of glutamate. AMN082 is the first selective mGluR7 agonist and has expanded the potential array of research opportunities on the effects of mGluR7 in the CNS. ==Significance== The two main types of glutamate receptors are ionotropic receptors and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic receptors (iGluRs) are fast-acting ligand-gated ion channels and include AMPA, Kainate and NMDA. Metabotropic receptors are G-protein coupled receptors that mediate slower, longer-lasting effects through second messenger systems and are responsible for other neuronal functions that are not typically controlled by iGluRs. mGluRs are split into 3 separate groups (Group I, Group II, Group III) based on pharmacological profile, sequence homology, and preferred signal transduction pathway. mGlur7 is a member of Group III, the least studied of the groups. The discovery of AMN082 will serve as a useful pharmacological tool to expand research on Group III mGluRs. ==References== Category:MGlu7 receptor agonists Category:Diamines ","title":"AMN082"},{"id":"20177851","text":"Oh How We Danced is the debut studio album by the British musician Jim Capaldi.

He is the senior editor and contributor to HIV and Community Mental Healthcare, a book published in 1998 by The Johns Hopkins University Press. ===Mental health work and scholarship=== Before his tenure at the University of South Florida, Knox was Director of the Western Tidewater Mental Health Center in Virginia (1978‚Äì1986). He also served on the faculty of the Eastern Virginia Medical School and on the Board of Directors of the Eastern Virginia Health Systems Agency. He has held a variety of leadership positions in national and state professional organizations and has been honored many times for his work. Michael Knox joined the USF faculty in 1986. For nine years, until 1995, Knox headed the only academic department of community mental health in the United States. As Department Chair, he directed an 80-member staff and oversaw an annual budget of $2.3 million. In 1995, and again in 1996, he was elected President of the USF Faculty Senate. He was elected Chair of the Advisory Council of Faculty Senates for 1997/1998. This organization represented all ten state universities and provided consultation to the Chancellor and Florida Board of Regents regarding academic issues. Since 1997 he has held the title of Distinguished University Professor at USF. In 1999 he served as a Visiting Scholar at the University of Oxford in England as part of a sabbatical assignment related to end-of-life care. His work is characterized by long- standing leadership positions in the field of community mental health, including service on the Board of Directors of the National Council of Community Mental Health Centers and advisory positions to the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. In addition, he chaired the first Steering Committee for the National Registry of Community Mental Health Services and has conducted site reviews nationwide for the federal Center for Mental Health Services. ===HIV/AIDS work and scholarship=== As founder and director of the USF Center for HIV Education and Research, Knox oversaw an annual budget of well over $3 million. Since 1988, the USF Center has provided continuing education to more than 500,000 health and mental healthcare professionals and students. Knox was the recipient of a National AIDS Education and Training Center (AETC) Grant from the US Department of Health and Human Services. As the Principal Investigator, Knox directed the Florida/Caribbean AETC, which was one of several centers based at leading universities around the country. The F/C AETC's mission was to ensure that physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dentists, pharmacists, and other health professionals in Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands receive state-of-the-art information, training, and consultation on the prevention and treatments of HIV and AIDS. Knox supervised the work of over 80 expert faculty in the field of HIV/AIDS as the Center worked collaboratively with the University of South Florida, the University of Puerto Rico, the University of Florida, the University of Miami, the University of the Virgin Islands and Florida A&M; University to provide faculty and clinical training sites throughout the region. Knox traveled to India in 2003 to speak and to dedicate two new educational programs associated with USF. He was Co-Chair of the American Foundation for AIDS Research's (amfAR) 16th National HIV/AIDS Update Conference held in March 2004 and delivered an opening plenary which argued against current US wars in favor of more government support for prevention. ===Antiwar efforts=== The long-standing antiwar activities of Michael Knox began in 1965 in opposition to the war in Vietnam. As a delegate to the 20th National Student Congress, he introduced a successful resolution to hold an anti-war demonstration in August 1967 in front of the White House. In 1970, Knox co-founded a draft counseling center and, in 1971, he blew the whistle on prohibited classified research at the University of Michigan and provided evidence that university researchers were perfecting weapon systems used by the military to kill and incapacitate other human beings. Since then, he has continued to engage in speeches, debates, interviews and other actions regarding peace. In 2005, Knox founded the US Peace Memorial Foundation. He directs its nationwide effort to recognize antiwar/peace leadership by writing and editing the US Peace Registry, awarding the annual US Peace Prize, providing educational programs, and eventually building a national monument - the US Peace Memorial - in Washington, DC. He was awarded the 2007 Marsella Prize for the Psychology of Peace and Social Justice at the 115th Annual Meeting of the American Psychological Association ‚Äúfor more than four decades of outstanding contributions to peace and humanitarian assistance.‚Äù He has officiated at the awarding of the US Peace Prize every year since 2009.

The user simply launches the TiLR Command Center and logs into TiLR. Once logged in, there is bi-directional video/audio between the robot and the TCC. The user is then able to commandeer the robot from remote, take snapshots, and even record the session for later viewing. TiLR Command Center is currently only supported on Windows XP/Vista. The next incarnation of the TiLR Command Center will be based on Flash technology where users will be able to log into TiLR and commandeer the robot from the World Wide Web. ==Development== TiLR was introduced in late 2007 by RoboDynamics following the MILO telepresence platform which was introduced in 2004.

Her syndicated astrology column, The Rockie Horoscope, appeared in a variety of publications (mostly alternative weekly newspapers), on her own website, and she also gave custom astrological readings for individuals. == Background == She was born in 1938 in Brooklyn, New York, and raised in Lawrence, New York, on Long Island. Ms. Gardiner was a Sagittarius. She attended Syracuse University and graduated from Barnard College. Following graduation she worked as an editor of children's books at Doubleday Publishing, where she worked with such well- known established writers such as Arthur Miller and Shirley Jackson. In 1958 she married Peter Gardiner, a pioneering film director of psychedelic \\"pop films\\" that were predecessors to music videos. Peter and Rockie had a son, Jeremy, born in 1963 and in 1966 the small Gardiner family moved to Los Angeles, California, where Rockie discovered an interest in astrology. Peter died in 1968 and Rockie remained single the rest of her life. == Rockie Horoscope Astrology Column == Rockie's astrology column, The Rockie Horoscope, first appeared in the L.A. Weekly in 1983. Rockie typically wrote a general forecast for each weekday telling about the overall astrological influences and how they would affect a given day. She would also write a general forecast for the week ahead. These would be followed by weekly sign readings for the individual sun signs. Her columns were known for their humor and wit. She frequently included pop-culture references to celebrities, politics, professional sports and pop music. Rockie famously predicted that U.S. President Ronald Reagan would die in office and that George H. W. Bush would assume the position, as well as that Jesse Jackson would be a vice- presidential candidate. Sometimes, when she had not gotten around to updating her website, she would take down the old information and post the following message: \\"Rockie is soaking up atmosphere and astrological insight.\\" Newspapers that carried her column included: The Improper Bostonian, The L.A. Weekly, The Las Vegas Weekly, The O.C. Weekly, The Philadelphia Weekly and The Village Voice. It was even carried in Vogue magazine.

A prot√©g√© of John Morrissey, he was involved in illegal gambling on Broadway and in Midtown Manhattan for over thirty years. He was also among the principal rivals of \\"Honest\\" John Kelly up until the turn of the 20th century and was considered one of the most successful and wealthiest gamblers in New York at the time of his death. ==Biography== John Daly was born in Troy, New York in 1838. He became interested in gambling at an early age spending much of his time at the local gambling house, one of many owned by sportsman John Morrissey, with whom he soon became acquainted. Daly became a protege of his and was eventually brought to New York where he earned a small fortune by the late 1860s. He owned a number of establishments, such as the Long Branch Club in Long Branch, New Jersey; however, his popular Broadway gaming resort was the one that he was most associated with. Daly later moved his gambling operations uptown and, in 1885, opened \\"John Daly's\\" at West Twenty-Ninth Street, which became nationally known and one of the most popular spots in the city during the next twenty years.\\"John Daly, Gambler, Dead.; Wealthiest Man of His Calling in New York -- Noted Horseman Also\\".

(pg. 211) ==Thoroughbred racing== Daly was also involved in horseracing during this time and was considered one of the biggest operators in the race-track betting rings in the country. He also raced horses, both alone and with partners, before forming a partnership with David GideonBowen, Edward L. Legacies of the Turf: A Century of Great Thoroughbred Breeders. Lexington, Kentucky: Eclipse Press, 2003. (pg. 42) in 1891. In their first year, they won the Futurity Stakes with His Highness and would dominate the competition for another four years. They twice won the Futurity with The Butterflies (1894) and Requital (1895) as well as the Suburban Handicap with Ramapo. The firm \\"Gideon & Daly\\" established a breeding farm near Red Bank, New Jersey called the \\"Holmdel Stud\\", but the property was leased when Daly retired from horse racing. Daly had mixed success in this enterprise, having lost a lot of money on both betting on the races and in the stock market. John Daly was associated with many political and underworld figures in his lifetime but was reportedly far closer to fellow sportsmen gamblers such as William Busteed, Sam Emery, Davy Johnson, Dinky Davis, and Richard Canfield, his eventual successor.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 313) His establishments were sometimes subjected to police raids, and Daly was alleged to have paid protection money as high as $100,000 a week to the New York Police Department,Morris, Lloyd R. Incredible New York: High Life and Low Life of the Last Hundred Years. New York: Random House, 1951. (pg. 226) which led to his later involvement in the Lexow Committee investigations. Daly was described as \\"a man of quiet, engaging manners\\" and regarded as a \\"generous employer\\", often continuing to pay his operators and allowing their families to live in his clubhouses even while his clubs were shut down by police raids. He also donated large portions of his income to charities in his later years. He was in ill health for two years prior to his death. Daly's wife died in 1905, and Daly died at his East Fifty-Fourth Street home on the evening of April 26, 1906. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Asbury, Herbert.

It marked a major turning point in Capaldi's career: it was his first album recorded after the breakup of Traffic, and more importantly it was his commercial breakthrough. While Capaldi's first two solo albums had been moderately successful in the United States (in fact, in Short Cut Draw Blood was his least successful album in the United States thus far, with both the album itself at number 193 and the single \\"Love Hurts\\" barely scraping into the Billboard charts at number 97), Short Cut Draw Blood entered the charts in several other countries for the first time. This was particularly evident in his native United Kingdom; the single \\"It's All Up to You\\" at number 27, released a year before the album, became his first top 40 hit there, only to be overshadowed the following year by his cover of \\"Love Hurts\\", which went all the way to number 4. The title of the album was conceived by co-producer Chris Blackwell.Capaldi, Jim (1983). \\"The Ends of Traffic, Soloing & Brazil\\".

London: Freedom Songs Ltd. ==Reception== Rolling Stone called the album \\"still uneven\\" and \\"unfocused\\" but a promising step forward from his first solo work. Their review approved of both the session musicians and the arrangements, but criticized Capaldi's lyrics as \\"simply absurd\\" or \\"rather embarrassingly sentimental\\", being at his best only on the cover of \\"Love Hurts\\", where \\"he brings a sense of pain very different from Roy Orbison's original.\\" AllMusic's retrospective review was more satisfied with the variety of styles, commenting \\"dipping into a wide range of musical styles, there is something for everyone on Short Cut Draw Blood\\", and saying the album is even better than his first.

The Yellowstone Club private ski and golf community was developed by Blixseth and used as collateral for a $375 million syndicated loan where the proceeds were used for other purposes, including an effort to build an exclusive luxury vacation club based on acquiring resort properties around the world. This venture failed, Mr. Blixseth and his wife divorced and the Yellowstone Club entered bankruptcy in November 2008. During its peak season, almost 650 people are employed at the club.Bozeman Daily Chronicle: Trickle-down economics The club was featured on CNBC's lifestyle show High Net Worth with Tyler Mathisen. Cyclist Greg LeMond, an early investor and homeowner/member, sued the club in 2006, saying club founder Tim Blixseth and his former wife Edra Denise (Crocker) Blixseth had borrowed $375 million from Credit Suisse Group and took $209 million for themselves as a dividend, jilting him and other investors. The suit was settled in 2008 for $39.5 million.Los Angeles Times/Bloomberg News: Cash stops flowing at Yellowstone Ms. Blixseth eventually agreed to pay Mr. LeMond and others a $21.5 million settlement; she paid only $8 million of that amount and Mr. LeMond and others joined the group of her creditors in her personal bankruptcy.\\"Checkmate at the Yellowstone Club\\" by Amy Wallace, The New York Times, June 13, 2009 (p.

Jack Kemp, the late U.S. politician, was on the club‚Äôs honorary board of directors with Mr. Quayle, among others. The Yellowstone Club is one of several developments that has been the subject of litigation between investors and Credit Suisse. The investors have accused Credit Suisse of fraudulently inflating the value of the developments in order to generate higher fees for itself. The core of the allegations centered on a new appraisal methodology conceived of by Credit Suisse executive David Miller, who in internal emails is referred to as Credit Suisse‚Äôs Dr. Frankenstein. The Swiss bank has repeatedly denied the allegations. ===2008-2009 bankruptcy protection=== On November 10, 2008, in the midst of the Great Recession, the Yellowstone Club filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It emerged from protection under new ownership on July 19, 2009.http://missoulian.com/news/state-and- regional/article_9bdc90aa-35ae-11df-94c0-001cc4c002e0.html When filing, the Club's prior owners owed US$343 million to creditors, such as banks and local contractors. In June 2009 Edra Blixseth spoke to a reporter for The New York Times about her and her ex-husband's business affairs from Porcupine Creek, her estate in Rancho Mirage, CA. She said she had hoped to retain the Club and her various estates and make Porcupine Creek income-producing with its private golf course. However, Porcupine Creek was sold to Larry Ellison in 2011 for $42.9 million by creditors who also sold the Blixseth's Chateau de Farcheville in France and other assets.Twisted saga involving former billionaire Tim Blixseth takes another turn, Forbes, April 7, 2011. In June 2009, as part of the bankruptcy resolution, the Yellowstone Club was sold for $115 million to a private equity firm, CrossHarbor Capital Partners, a firm led by a Yellowstone Club member, Sam Byrne. Prior to the bankruptcy and disclosure of the Credit Suisse-Blixseth loan details, negotiations with that same buyer had put a $400 million price tag on the club. In the 2009 bankruptcy transaction, Byrne also \\"invested $75 million above the purchase price in repairs and set aside an additional $15 million to pay the club‚Äôs creditors,\\" according to the Times. The deal was brokered by Jeff Woolson, Managing Director of the CBRE Golf & Resort Properties Group,http://cbregolf.com/ and Steve Lehr, Managing Director of CBRE's Land Services Group.

Shortly thereafter CrossHarbor and Big Sky Resort jointly acquired the bankrupt Moonlight Basin ski club and began consolidation of the newly acquired ski terrain with that of Big Sky Resort. Big Sky Resort release Hart Howerton is working with CrossHarbor on the master planning of their entire 25,000 acre landholding, as well as architectural design of the Yellowstone Club Village Core and Spanish Peaks Lodge. ===Location and ski mountain=== Most of the ski runs are on Pioneer Mountain (). Pioneer Mountain has a summit elevation of . The Yellowstone Club resort has several lifts and ski runs that tie it directly into Big Sky Resort's lift system. The Big Sky ski area and the Yellowstone Club share a five-mile border. The ski resorts are surrounded by 250,000 acres of the Gallatin National Forest. Snowfall averages approximately 300 inches a year and is very consistent from year to year and week to week. Although it is one of the few western ski resorts located east of the continental divide, the area receives consistent light snows. The club's tagline is \\"Private Powder\\" and this is made possible by frequent snows and low skier traffic. The ski terrain is extensive and varied and compares favorably with other well known ski resorts. Pioneer Ridge has numerous \\"double black\\" expert runs and challenging chutes.

It was director Tim Pek's debut film and was produced by Transparent Pictures. The success of The Red Sense led Transparent Pictures to produce films such as Bokator and Annoyed. The Red Sense was first released in Australia in August 2008, and though banned for general release there, screened in Cambodia in December that year. It is rated M (Recommended for mature audiences) by the Office of Film and Literature Classification of Australia. ==Plot== The film is a mystery story set in Cambodia in the Khmer Rouge era. ==Cast== * Rithy Dourng * Niki Davis * Narith Eng * Sarina Luy * Kaply Mon * Vicheth Muy * Paly Net ==Production== In 2004 Khmer graphic designer Tim Pek took a small role for a short film called Chhay. The film was about two brothers and focused on the pre- and post-Khmer Rouge era. Exposed for the first time to how films were produced, Tim started to contemplate various ways to improve the concepts of film making. A few months later, Tim received a Cambodian Fashion Show video from Adelaide with an extra feature of a five minutes short film, directed by Chhai Thach. This film, entitled ‚ÄòBugger!‚Äô, was made in New Zealand and had won the best short film award. Impressed with the simple story, Tim got in contact with Chhai and discussed the making of a new short film as a team. A month later, Chhai came up with another mystery story, also set during the Khmer Rouge era. After some discussion, both Tim and Chhai agreed to make three parts of the story. Tim managed to produce a script within a few weeks for a 15-minute short film intended for entry into film festivals. The film project was created in early 2005 and became The Red Sense, or Vignean Krohom in Khmer. Pek said of the film: \\"I had the opportunity to work with various non-actors which I thought would be a terrific opportunity as a director. The casts and crews are very supportive, which continues to keep my spirit high\\". ==ReleasePremier=== Audiences were given a preview of the film in Adelaide, Australia. Its official release, however, was in Melbourne on 3 August 2008, with special guest Mr Yuhorn Chea, the former mayor of the City of Greater Dandenong. There were also interviews with several media outlets. The film was banned for release in Cambodia as the Cambodian Government does not allow films pertaining to the Khmer Rouge. This has become an issue among the film's fans: \\" I really want to watch the Red Sense. I have heard of it for a long time, and I have watched the trailer. It seems interesting. Some people told me that it‚Äôs not the same as other Khmer Rouge movies, filmed in the past.\\"said a Khmer monk now living abroad, while a foreigner working in the Khmer film industry said, \\"It‚Äôs a shame that Tim can‚Äôt get the film screened over here, but then this is the country where the Khmer Rouge period has been erased from school text books.\\" Despite its being banned, the film was screened in Siem Reap during the second Cambofest. ==Reception== In Angkorian Society, Hemara In said, \\"Tim Pek's film is very promising. He has been through the Pol Pot, Khmer Rouge and understands how this effect him, very proud of Tim Pek and a great Cambodian community here will support him and would like to wish Tim Pek a great future\\" (sic) while two critics of Anonymous, Chris & Margot, stated that \\"The emotionals were there and come from the heart. It deserves all the praise that it gets\\" Says Chris.\\" The Khmer Rouge result was some consequences and I congratulate Tim Pek on The Red Sense.\\" Says Margot. Clayton MP, Mr. Hong Lim also described the film to positive reviews. He said: \\"The way he approaches the film is very opportunistic, the way that Tim portrays comes straight from the human heart. These story brings out the Khmer Rouge quite well, the way he put in with the past and present. All Cambodian communities should be very proud of this film\\". In the Adelaide premier, the film also received A reviews. A film critic, Paul Millson, said: \\"Many people were very happy that Tim made a film for the thousands of family members that want this story to be told and shown all around the world for all to see\\". ===Awards and nominations=== As well as these reviews, the film received awards at CamboFest film and video festival in Siem Reap, Cambodia. It was named the Golden Buffalo winner as the best local film. ==ReferencesCategory:2008 films Category:Cambodian films Category:Australian films Category:Khmer-language films Category:English-language films Category:2000s thriller films Category:2008 horror films Category:Cambodian horror films Category:Australian horror films ","title":"The Red Sense"},{"id":"20178200","text":"The College of Medicine University of Baghdad, formerly known as the Iraqi Royal Medical College, was established in 1927. saib shawkat, https://web.archive.org/web/20091021085404/http://geocities.com/akramjfr/saibshawkat.html In 1927, Harry Sinderson helped to establish a new medical school in Baghdad, which became the Royal Medical College when the King opened its new building in 1930.

It ran between Sira and Flekkefjord in Agder, Norway. The only current activity on the line is tourist draisines. The station buildings along the line were designed by the architect Paul Armin Due‚Äîthese have all been demolished. The line opened in 1904 as a extension of the narrow gauge J√¶ren Line. It was planned as the first step of a main line along the South Coast. At Flekkefjord, there was steam ship connection, onwards to Oslo. In 1941, the line was converted to standard gauge, and in 1944 the S√∏rland Line was completed. The western part of the Flekkefjord Line was integrated into it, while the remaining section became the branch line that kept the name Flekkefjord Line. During the 1940s, steam locomotive-hauled trains were replaced by railcars. Following the declining traffic, in part due to the slow speeds caused by the line's narrow profile, the line was closed, with the last trains running in 1990. ==HistoryConstruction=== The first committee that looked into the possibility of a railway to Flekkefjord was created in 1875. After the completion of J√¶ren Line from Stavanger to Egersund, in 1878, proposals were made to build an extension westwards along the coast, that eventually would reach Oslo. The first part of what was named the Vestland Line was passed by Parliament in 1894, and would run from Egersund, via Sira, to Flekkefjord. The initial proposal proposed that the line would eventually continue onwards via Mandal to Kristiansand. The decision to build the line was taken by the Parliament of Norway in 1894.Aspenberg (1994): 217 Construction started in 1896, and was originally planned to be completed by 1902. However, delays prevented the line from being be brought into use before 1 November 1904. The line was built by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and was long. The coast between Egersund and Flekkefjord would give a very difficult route to build, so it was decided to build a more inland line. Like the J√¶ren Line, and most railways being built at the time, the Flekkefjord Line was built in narrow gauge. Both telephone and telegraph cables were laid along the line. Along the section from Sirnes to Flekkefjord, there were many vertical cliffs straight into the fjord, forcing , or 38 percent, of the line to be built in tunnels. Of the whole length from Egersund to Flekkefjord, there are 46 tunnels, totaling . The most prominent was Ravnejuret Tunnel which is long. Just before Flekkefjord, a bridge was built that crosses Selurelva; it was a reused bridge from the Voss Line. In total, about 12% of the line consisted of tunnels. Francis Hagerup, when delivering the line's opening speech, remarked that no other railway had until then been more difficult to construct. All the stations along the line were designed by Paul Armin Due, with all but the terminal station built in wood. Flekkefjord Station was built as a three-story brick building in Art Nouveau. In addition, there was construction a depot and a wharf at Flekkefjord. Passengers could transfer to steam ship services that operated eastwards along the south coast towards Oslo. ===Pre-war operations=== The first part of the line to open for temporary operation was between Flekkefjord and Moi on 1 October 1904. For the official opening, the town of Flekkefjord was adorned with Norwegian flags. A train departed to Egersund on 31 October 1904 with several notable passengers: Prime Minister Francis Hagerup, State Railways director Elias Sunde and board member Sven Aarrestad, director of traffic Jens Christian Mellbye, Flekkefjord's mayor and city council as well as other mayors of the district. Festivities continued on the next day, when the train returned from Egersund to Flekkefjord. Initially there were four services in each direction each day, with three services on holy days. The train that connected with the steam ship would wait up to 45 minutes in case of delays, to allow connection. Until 1927, the routes remained the same. That year, the Krager√∏ Line opened, and it became possible to take a night train from Oslo to Krager√∏, continue by bus to Flekkefjord, and be in Stavanger the following afternoon. Travel time was further reduced when the S√∏rland Line was extended to Arendal in 1935. The initial rolling stock was from the Voss Line, and some of the bridges and track was from that line too. The Voss Line was being upgraded to rail tracks, and of track was used on the Flekkefjord Line. Flekkefjord Line at Lundevatnet Until 1927, all trains were operated with steam locomotives. NSB introduced the first diesel multiple unit with the introduction of \\"lightning trains\\" that corresponded with coach services that connected with the Krager√∏ Line. The first were Class 14 railcars. These reduced travel time from Flekkefjord to Stavanger by 50 minutes to 3 hours 15 minutes. In addition to passengers, major cargo were herring and lumber. ===Connecting the coast=== In 1923, it was decided by parliament that the S√∏rland Line, that would connect Oslo, Kristiansand and Stavanger, would follow an inner route. The section of the Flekkefjord Line from Egersund to Sira would become part of that line, while the eastern from Sira to Flekkefjord would become a branch line, retaining the Flekkefjord Line name. Since the S√∏rland Line needed to be built from the east, construction along the Flekkefjord Line did not start until 1940. After the German occupation of Norway during World War II, the German occupation forces were rebuilding the narrow gauge railways to standard gauge. In 1940‚Äì41, the Flekkefjord and J√¶ren Lines were rebuilt to dual gauge. Not until 1944 was the Flekkefjord Line only standard gauge. Due to limited funds, and unlike the rest of the J√¶ren Line, the profile of the Flekkefjord Line was not changed during the conversion of gauge. This gave a speed limit of , and creative solutions such as lowering height of the ballast by . The route from Egersund to Sira received a better upgrade, since it was to become part of the main line through Southern Norway. The route between Sira and Sirnes was completely rebuilt. This gave severe limits to the use of the section between Flekkefjord and Sirnes; most classes of trains could not run on the line, as were freight trains.Aspenberg (1994): 218 ===Post-war operations=== After the line had been relegated to a branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was car traffic, which did not exist in Flekkefjord until 1918, but thereafter became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 units were used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 units were bought from Sweden. At first, two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved to work well, NSB bought them for 95,000 Swedish kronor plus freight. Two more units were bought in 1986.Aspenberg (1994): 45 ===Closing=== The line had major limitations on speed, and also served the \\"wrong direction\\", heading westwards into less populated areas instead of the populated parts of Agder in the east. Major investments would be needed to upgrade the line to a suitable speed, and through the 1970s this became an important issue of debate. On the other hand, the line had among the highest ridership of the branch lines, with 120,000 passengers per year, which was for instance 50% higher than the Arendal Line, which was not closed.Aspenberg (1994): 219 However, parliament decided to close the line, along with several other branch lines, in 1988, with effect from 1990. The last scheduled train ran on 31 December 1990. There were plans to establish private operations along the line. Continental Railway Systems was established by Rasmus Surdal. The company would be allowed to use the rolling stock and infrastructure, and two of the trains were painted white. However, it was not possible for the company to get the necessary bank surety demanded by NSB, and nothing came of the plans. The line has been suggested preserved as a cultural heritage, since it represents one of very few railways with the original narrow gauge profile intact. However, all stations have been demolished; Flekkefjord in 1970, Sirnes in 1977 and Flikkeid in 1988. The organization Friends of the Flekkefjord Line offer rental of draisines for tourists since the closure of the line, and a round trip from Flekkefjord to Bakkekleivi just outside Sira takes about three hours. However, the Norwegian National Rail Administration have since banned the operation of draisines until the line is fully fenced in. == See also == * Narrow gauge railways in Norway == References == ;Bibliography * ;Notes ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Friends of the Flekkefjord Line Category:Railway lines in Norway Category:Railway lines in Agder Category:Railway lines opened in 1904 Category:1904 establishments in Norway Category:Closed railway lines in Norway Category:3 ft 6 in gauge railways in Norway Category:Standard gauge railways in Norway ","title":"Flekkefjord Line"},{"id":"20178234","text":"John N.

The son of William and Elizabeth Walker, of the Aldwark-Hungate area, John Walker began a 7-year bound apprenticeship to Thomas & Joseph Gibson, Ironmongers of Pavement, York on 25 March 1815. Thomas died, and after completing his indentures, Walker stayed with the firm. In 1824 he became a Freeman of York and by 1829 he had become Gibson's partner. He must have been a very industrious young man, since by November 1837 he had bought out the Gibson foundry at 33 Walmgate and set up his own business. In 1827 Walker married Jane Thomlinson of Whenby. The foundry site () on the banks of the River Foss, which facilitated water-borne transport, was originally silty land that had been reclaimed by a medieval dam and was a notoriously unsanitary slum. Five of the Walkers' 7 children died, perhaps partly because of the unhealthy conditions, only 1 surviving beyond his 23rd year. Walker stood unsuccessfully as Conservative candidate for his local ward, but became a City Commissioner and a Churchwarden of St Denys Church, Walmgate. He 'for many years paid the expenses of instructing the men in his employment in singing, and by this means raised an efficient church choir'. [Yorks Gazette 2 July 1853] Beginning locally, supplying the first gas lamps and railings for St Leonards Place, the firm prospered and in 1845-6 supplied the gates to Kew Gardens, London. This commission earned Walker the patronage of Queen Victoria in 1847 and he was granted permission to add \\"Ironfounders & Purveyors of Smithy Work to the Queen\\" to his letterheading. In 1850-53 his firm supplied the gates and railings to the British Museum, London. Photo: The gates were designed by Sydney Smirke and weighed 10 tons, according to the museum's records. They were originally opened by a windlass. Walker's tender of ¬£6,786 contrasted with 2 London foundries' tenders of ¬£7248 and ¬£9050. Considering the additional substantial costs of transport from Yorkshire, it seems likely that Walker astutely took the opportunity to acquire kudos before profit. He also supplied the cast iron standard lamps in the museum forecourt, which were originally gas. According to a British History report , Walker achieved his success by submitting tenders far below those of his competitors. He supplied many large landowners with gates and railings, including Queen Victoria at Sandringham, Norfolk. In 1843, following an accidental fire in 1840, Walker's supplied cast iron roof trusses for the South Nave of York Minster, which were erected by the York builder George Coates. Then in 1849 they supplied similar iron trusses for Castle Oliver, Limerick, Ireland to designs by the York architect George Fowler Jones. By 1851 Walker's employed 52 men and according to the 1871 Census, 57 workmen & 5 boys. Measom's Illustrated Guide to the North Eastern Railway, 1861, says Walker's employed upwards of 100 workmen. Upon his death in 1853, John was succeeded in what had by then become an extremely healthy business, by his son William (bapt. Whenby July 1828). On 28 April 1855 William married Sarah Thomas of King's Snaith, York and they lived away from the foundry, at Lawrence Street, then Clifton Grove. In the 1870s William adopted his mother's maiden name, becoming William Thomlinson Walker, later hyphenating the names. The firm were then Thomlinson-Walker Ltd, Iron Founders. In 1856 the Dixon's Yard premises were sold for ¬£1,000 and the firm moved to 76 Walmgate, naming the new premises Victoria Foundry ()). The Bill of Sale for Dixon's Yard lists a sizeable Master's House; Smiths' Shops with Chambers; 2 large Warehouses, a large yard, Counting Houses, Stables, Cowshed, Piggeries, Hay & Harness Rooms, in all about 1,639 square yards (1,370 square metres). It seems logical that the new premises were substantially larger, or more favourably positioned. Business continued to improve during the 3rd quarter of the 19th century, and in 1886 Walker-Thomlinson Ltd bought adjacent premises at 78 & 80 Walmgate to develop as showrooms. Walker's developed a healthy business exporting railings and gates to colonial and foreign governments, including the Botanical Gardens in Mauritius and the Maharajah Holkar of India.Yorkshire Gazette 3 June 1854 p. 6Yorkshire Gazette 31 May 1856 p. 9 Walkers exhibited at Yorks Agricultural Society Show in 1857 and at the Yorks Fine Art & Industrial Exhibition in 1866. York Castle Museum has a leather-bound edition of 'Design Book No.1 of Ironwork' manufactured by WM. Walker 365/41'. William became active in local politics, becoming a Justice of the Peace, then in 1874, Sheriff of York. He became in 1854 a member of the Yorkshire Agricultural Society; was a prominent member of the York incorporated Sunday School Committee and also dedicated much time to his church. He apparently had a similar social conscience to his father and famously reduced his employees' working hours by half an hour on weekdays and an hour on Saturday. It isn't known at what hour work started in the mornings, but after the reduction they closed at 5.30 and on Saturday at 4.00. This gesture earned him the thanks of his men, who responded 'testifying to him their gratitude for this unsolicited concession' and allegedly his great astonishment and pleasure when they presented him with an engraved 'handsome silver inkstand, pen and pencil case, gold pen, letter seal and papier mache tray'. William became a prominent citizen of York and donated an impressive stained glass window to Holy Trinity Church, Goodramgate, York. He is depicted kneeling at the feet of Christ, bearing a scroll. His only son, John Richard Walker (bapt. 10 April 1856 at St Denys, Walmgate) assisted him in the business and upon William's death in 1911, his recently altered Will named his son as beneficiary of the company. in 1886 John Richard Walker married Mary Louisa Esh. They had 2 sons, in 1887 and 1890 and a daughter, Sarah. The 2nd son died in the First World War and the 1st son, Eddie moved with his sister Sarah to Rhodesia. John Richard Walker does not appear to have been made of the same stuff as his father and grandfather. The firm floundered and John brought in fresh capital in the form of a Mr Birch, with whom he set up a new company at the same premises. Walker's ceased trading shortly after John's death in 1923 and his widowed 2nd wife, Sarah Margaret Jemima lived thereafter in extreme poverty, in almshouses. The area where Walker's once flourished is now known as Foundry Square Gardens and is currently being redeveloped for residential use, having been an office block in the 1970s. ==ReferencesSources== Much of the information in this article is adapted from The York Historian Vol 1. 1976, kindly provided by York Museum.

As its title indicates, the book is one entry in the long-running series of Oz books written by L. Frank Baum and his many successors.Paul Nathanson, Over the Rainbow: The Wizard of Oz as a Secular Myth of America, Albany, NY, State University of New York Press, 1991.Suzanne Rahn, The Wizard of Oz: Shaping an Imaginary World, New York, Twayne, 1998.Michael O'Neal Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, Lawrence, KS, University Press of Kansas, 1997. ==The authors== The McGraws, mother and daughter, wrote an earlier Oz book, Merry Go Round in Oz, published in 1963. In their collaboration, the elder McGraw, a veteran children's book author, did the actual writing; she credited her daughter Lauren with story contributions. In Forbidden Fountain, the text is prefaced with an address to \\"Dear Fans of Oz, Young, Old, and In-Between,\\" which calls Lauren Lynn McGraw \\"Assistant Inventor and Head Trouble-Shooter,\\" while Eloise Jarvis McGraw signs herself as \\"Chief of Bureau of Extraordinary Communications.\\" ==The plot== A child named Emeralda Ozgood, a native of the Emerald City, prepares a concoction of limeade to celebrate the annual Clover Fair -- but she naively uses water from the Forbidden Fountain. She only has one customer before she drops and breaks her pitcher; but that customer is Princess Ozma, who drinks the drink and loses her memory. Wandering off and losing her crown, Ozma falls in with a series of new acquaintances, including the Monarch of the Butterflies (who names her \\"Poppy\\" after the flowers in her hair) and a talking hedgebird who advises her. Outfitted in boy's clothes and hat, Ozma/Poppy meets a lamb named Lambert, who is ostracized from his Gillikin flock for his unnatural white color. The two stumble into Camouflage Creek, and undergo a bewildering string of transformations into bugs and beasts. Back in their own forms, they are confronted by an inept would-be highwayman named Tobias Bridlecull Jr., who quickly becomes the third member of their rambling trio. He carries a Suggestion Box that volunteers suggestions instead of receiving them -- as in \\"Suggest lunch\\" and \\"Suggest oil for Suggestion Box.\\" Returning home to Pumperdink from the Clover Fair, Kabumpo the Elegant Elephant falls into adventures of his own; he is waylaid by the animated toys of Wyndup Town. The elephant literally dumps into \\"Poppy\\" and company among the bubblegum and mucilage geysers (or \\"gozzers\\") of Gozzerland National Park. The four travelers combine, for further adventures in Cleanitupia and Pristinia. It is only when Kabumpo sees \\"Poppy\\" with her long hair unconfined that he recognizes Ozma; then he needs to win the trust of the suspicious amnesiac and bring her home to the Emerald City. (He fails completely at the winning of trust, and hauls her back bodily.) Eventually, Ozma uses the Magic Belt to restore her memory and return to normal. The Forbidden Fountain is sealed off forever, as a threat. ==Details== The McGraws, like other Oz authors, have to make choices among the vast and sometimes contradictory details of life in Oz. They choose to give Oz a currency (of \\"ozzos\\" and \\"piozters\\"); but in the third chapter of The Emerald City of Oz, Baum specifically states that there is \\"no such thing as money...\\" in Oz. (As the Tin Woodman says in the fifteenth chapter of The Road to Oz, \\"Money in Oz!...What a queer idea!\\") Baum, however, was not wholly consistent in this detail (as in others), and the early books in the series do feature Oz currency.Eric Gjovaag, \\"Money in Oz! What a Queer Idea!,\\" The Baum Bugle, Vol. 39 No. 3 (Winter 1995), pp. 13-15. Animals talk in the book; even insects do. Yet animals also eat each other: while transformed into talking dragonflies, \\"Poppy\\" and Lambert eat their fill of \\"what-gnats.\\" Later, a Purple Wolf wants to eat Lambert. This raises the vexing question of death in Oz. Some of the book's action is set in a border region between the Gillikin Country and the Winkie Country, which allows a blending of the two regions' characteristic colors, purple and yellow. Lauren McGraw provided the book with a map that situates the Winkie Country in the western quadrant of Oz, as in Baum's original scheme. ==Forbidden fountain== The forbidden fountain of the title is the same created by Baum in his sixth Oz book, The Emerald City of Oz -- an enchanted fountain that purges the memories of all who drink its Water of Oblivion. In that book, the fountain provides the resolution of the plot conflict, through which the invading hordes of a barbarian army are defeated without violence. The fountain appears in later Oz books by Baum and his followers; it is significant in Baum's The Magic of Oz, Rachel Cosgrove Payes's The Wicked Witch of Oz, and Edward Einhorn's Paradox in Oz. A rich imaginative heritage lies behind Baum's fountain. There is a \\"forbidden fountain\\" in Welsh mythology, though instead of effecting drinkers' memories it expels them from fairyland, where it is located.W. Jenkyn Thomas, The Welsh Fairy Book, London, T. Fisher Unwin, 1907; Whitefish, MT, Kessinger Publishing, 2004; p. 62-3. The idea of forbidden drink is closely related to that of forbidden food, which occurs most famously in the \\"forbidden fruit\\" of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Book of Genesis, but in other contexts too. The idea of water that purges the drinker's memory is also ancient. In Greek mythology it occurs as the river Lethe: the souls of the dead lose their memories of their earthly lives by drinking its water. The same idea can also be found in Eastern and other literatures, as in the \\"Well of the Waters of Forgetfulness\\"S. Weir Mitchell, \\"Little Stories: IV. The Waters of Oblivion,\\" The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine, Vol. LXIV / New Series Vol. XLII (May to October 1902), pp. 40-2. and other guises. \\"The 'Drink of Forgetfulness' is found in Greek, Hindu, Norse, and other mythologies.\\"James Hastings, John A. Selbie, et al., eds., Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, Vol. 9, New York, Charles Scribner's Sons, 1908; Whitefish, MT, Kessinger Publishing, 2003; p. 78. The concept received an eighteenth-century expression in James Ridley's The Tales of the Genii (1764), and from there made its way into drama and even to the visual arts, in John Martin's Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion (1812). Baum, however, made a noteworthy innovation in giving his Water of Oblivion a moral dimension. In his fantasy universe, those who drink from the Forbidden Fountain not only lose their recollections but become benign, \\"as innocent as babes.\\" (Though this is irrelevant to Princess Ozma, who was benign to begin with.) ==References * On The Forbidden Fountain of Oz Category:Oz (franchise) books Category:1980 fantasy novels Category:1980 American novels Category:1980 children's books ","title":"The Forbidden Fountain of Oz"},{"id":"20178339","text":"The preface to the Libellus de exordio in the Cambridge manuscript (MS Ff. i.27 p. 122) The Libellus de exordio atque procursu istius, hoc est Dunhelmensis, ecclesie (),Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, p. xv. in short Libellus de exordio, is a historical work of marked literary character composed and compiled in the early 12th-century and traditionally attributed to Symeon of Durham. It relates the history of bishopric and church of Durham and its predecessors at Lindisfarne and Chester-le-Street (Cunecacestre). It is sometimes also known as the Historia Dunelmensis ecclesiae (English: History of the Church of Durham). ==Manuscripts== The following is a list of manuscripts containing the text. Each manuscript has its own history, and contains different interpolations and notes. In brackets is the letter or letters used by Rollason, its latest editor, to refer to the manuscript in shorthand: * Durham, University Library, Cosin V.II.6, (C) Discussed in Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xvii‚Äîxxii. * London, British Library, Cotton Faustina A.V, (F)Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xxii‚Äîxxiii. * Cambridge University Library, Ff. i.27, (Ca)Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xxiv‚Äîxxvii. * Durham, Durham Cathedral Library, A.IV.36, (D')Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xxviii‚Äîxxix. * Oxford, Bodleian Library, Holkham misc. 25, (H)Formerly known as Holkham Hall 468; Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xxix‚Äîxxxi. * London, British Library, Cotton Titus A.II, (T)Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xxxi‚Äîxxxiii. * London, British Library, Cotton Vespasian A.VI, (V)Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xxxiii‚Äîxxxiv. * York, Minster Library, XVI.I.12, (Y)Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xxxiv‚Äîxxxvii. * Oxford, Bodleian Library, Fairfax 6, (Fx)Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xxxvii‚Äîxxxix. * Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud misc. 700, (L)Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xl‚Äîxlii. ==Authorship and dating== According to the Libellus's preface, the work was carried out on the orders of the monastic leadership of Durham Priory; probably it was Prior Turgot himself who commissioned it.Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, p. xliv. The latest datable contemporary event mentioned in the core of the text (albeit obliquely) is the opening of the tomb of St Cuthbert for his removal into the new cathedral of Durham, 29 August 1104.Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, p. xlii. Manuscripts \\"C\\" and \\"F\\" are the earliest witnesses of the text, with \\"C\\" and \\"F\\" written in the same scriptorium while Turgot was prior of Durham, a position Turgot gave up before 1115 at the latest, but perhaps before 1107.Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xlii, lxi‚Äîlviii. The text can therefore be said to have been completed at some point between 1104 and 1107 x 1115. The work is traditionally attributed to Symeon of Durham, the precentor of Durham Cathedral. The evidence for this are rubrics in manuscript \\"Ca\\" and a rubric in manuscript \\"H\\". These date respectively to the late 12th century and to around 1300.Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xliii‚Äîxliv. Though there is nothing in either \\"C\\" or \\"F\\", modern scholarship has largely reaffirmed the traditional authorship of the text. David Rollason, the text's most recent editor, sees Symeon's role more as that of a lead author and compiler than sole author. ==Published versions== The text has been published four times: * Roger Twysden (ed.), Historiae Anglicanae Scriptores Decem, (London, 1652), vol. i * Thomas Belford (ed.), Symeonis monachi Dunhelmensis, Libellus de exordio atque procursu Dunhelmensis ecclesie, (London, 1732) * Thomas Arnold (ed.), Symeonis monachi Opera omnia, (Rolls Series lxxv; 2 vols., 1882‚Äî5), vol. i * David Rollason (ed.), Libellus de exordio atque procursu istius, hoc est Dunhelmensis, ecclesie = Tract on the origins and progress of this the Church of Durham, (Oxford, 2000) Twysden's edition was based wholly on \\"Ca\\".Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, p. xci. Bedford uses \\"C\\" mainly, though consulted \\"F\\" and \\"Ca\\" for variant readings and chapter headings.Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. xci‚Äîxcii. Arnold's edition made use of all the manuscripts except \\"D\\", \\"H\\" and \\"V\\".Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, p. xcii. An English translation has been published in The Church Historians of England, Vol. 3, Part 2, trans. by Joseph Stevenson (London: Seelays, 1855); reprinted as Simeon of Durham, A History of the Church of Durham, Felinfach: Llanerch Publications, 1993. Rollason's edition includes a facing English-language translation. ==Coverage and sources== The coverage of the Libellus de exordio extends from the beginning of Christianity among the English of Northumbria and the foundation of a bishopric at Lindisfarne, to the death of Bishop William of Saint-Calais in 1096. The Libellus demonstrates the continuity of Durham's history, and in particular it justifies William of Saint-Calais's expulsion of Durham's clerical community in 1083 in order to replace it with a group of Benedictine monks drawn from Wearmouth and Jarrow. What historical continuity the Libellus finds comes from the constant presence of the community's patron, Saint Cuthbert. The miracles worked in Cuthbert's name during the late Anglo-Saxon period were particularly flamboyant, and the Libellus contains engaging accounts of some of these, including the miracle of the three waves (when Cuthbert turned a portion of the Irish Sea into blood in order to prevent his followers from taking his relics out of England, see Libellus ii.11), the foundation of Durham (when Cuthbert's body, being moved across England on a cart, refused to be moved, signaling his desire to remain at Durham, see Libellus iii.1), and several picturesque deaths visited upon the enemies of Cuthbert's devotees. The work consists of four books: *Book I, from reign of Oswald (634‚Äî642) to reign of Ceolwulf (729‚Äî737) *Book II, from the death of King Ceolwulf (737) to episcopate of Ealdhun (995) *Book III, from episcopate of Ealdhun (995) to the murder of bishop William Walcher (1080) *Book IV, episcopate of William of Saint-Calais and the refoundation of the Priory (1081‚Äî1096) Many earlier sources have been incorporated into the work, particularly the works of Bede and some now lost Northumbrian sources, including a set of \\"Northern Annals\\", a chronicle of the monastery of Durham, and what appear to be the oral reminiscences of the clerks who had been dislodged during William of Saint- Calais's reign.See >Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. lxviii‚Äîlxxvi. ==Extensions== There are two texts which constitute extensions of the Libellus de exordio. Firstly, six manuscripts contain a \\"summary\\" text which ends c. 1083, when an Benedictine priory was established at Durham.Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp, lxvi‚Äîlxvii. It is unclear if this was written before or after the Libellus de exordio.Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, p, lxvi. Attached to the Libellus de exordio in eight manuscripts (all save \\"F\\" and \\"V\\") is an extension covering the period from the episcopate from Ranulf Flambard (1099‚Äî1128) to the installation of William de St Barbe (1143‚Äî1152).Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, p. lxvii. A variant version of this in \\"Ca\\" ends with the episcopate of Hugh le Puiset (1153‚Äî1195).Rollason (ed.), Libellus de Exordio, pp. lxvii, 311‚Äî23. ==NotesReferences== * Category:12th-century Latin books Category:Historical writing from Norman and Angevin Durham ","title":"Libellus de exordio"},{"id":"20178395","text":"Pyroteuthis is a genus of squid in the family Pyroteuthidae.

It was held as the king's gaol for the county of Devon. The manor of Bicton was granted by King Henry I to John Janitor. In 1229, Ralph Balistarius, or Le Balister (the cross-bow-bearer), occupied the manor. His descendants, the Alabasters, a corruption of Le Balister, held the manor for five generations.

It was purchased in the 16th century of the Coplestones by Sir Robert Denys (1525‚Äì1592) of nearby Holcombe Burnel, who built a new manor house and created one of the county's first enclosed deer parks. Sir Robert Denys's son, Sir Thomas Denys died and his daughter Anne Denys received the manor. She had married Sir Henry Rolle (d.1616) of Stevenstone, Devon and the estate was conveyed to her husband. Henry was the son of John Rolle, and great grandson to the founder of the Rolle family of Stevenstone, George Rolle (died 1552). Henry and the former Miss Deny's son, Dennis Rolle, Esquire died in 1638, leaving a son who died in his infancy and a daughter named Florence. Henry's nephew, also named Henry, of Beam near Torrington, inherited the estate, but died without a living heir in 1647. The manor was then passed to John Rolle through marriage to his cousin Florence Rolle, co-heiress of Dennis Rolle, Esquire of Bicton, who at the time of his death in 1706 held nearly 40 manors in Devonshire and estates in Cornwall, Somersetshire, and Northamptonshire. John had married the heiress of Marrais and settled there. He was made Knight of the Bath (K.B.) and was a representative for the county. John and Florence had four sons, the eldest son was the grandfather of Henry was made Baron Role in 1748 and died in 1750 without issue and the title became extinct. In 1787 the lord of the manor was exonerated from the superintendence of the county gaol.

Wyatt also designed the Lodge, built at the same time.Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840, s.v. \\"Wyatt, James\\". The site was described about 1820 to have a \\"commanding full view of the British Channel\\" and ancient beech and oak trees within the estate's park. The original text was from Somers-Cocks or Rudolph Ackermann's The Repository of Arts. The mansion, with two extensive wings, held an extensive collection of art, including works by Rembrandt and Ruysdael.

Prior to the 1957 Northwestern game, Van Pelt was bed-ridden with the flu, but despite the illness, he led the Wolverines to a 34-14 win. Van Pelt completed three of four passes in the game for 66 yards and two touchdowns, including a 45-yard touchdown pass to Gary Prahst. He also ran for a touchdown and successfully kicked three extra points. In a 24-7 win over Minnesota, Van Pelt was responsible for 18 of Michigan's points as he threw two touchdown passes (including a 37-yard completion to Bowers), kicked a field goal and added three extra points. In his final game for Michigan, Van Pelt passed for 106 yards (including a 33-yard touchdown pass to Brad Myers), the highest single-game total during his three years Michigan career. However, it was not enough as Ohio State beat Michigan, 31-14. After the 1957 season, Van Pelt played in two post-season all-star games. He played in the North‚ÄìSouth Shrine Game at the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida, throwing a touchdown pass for the winning North team. In January 1958, he also played in the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama. In three years at Michigan, Van Pelt completed 66 of 134 passes for 989 yards, ten touchdowns and five interceptions. He also had two rushing touchdowns and one receiving touchdown. ==Professional football== Van Pelt was selected by the Washington Redskins in the fifth round (55th overall pick) of the 1958 NFL Draft. Instead of playing in the NFL, Van Pelt signed a contract in February 1958 to play for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. In his rookie season, Van Pelt began the season playing principally as a defensive halfback, but he got the chance to start at quarterback when Kenny Ploen was injured. He played so well in place of Ploen that he won the job as Winnipeg's starting quarterback. Van Pelt also handled placekicking for the Bombers. He set a Canadian Football League record with a 107-yard touchdown pass to Ernie Pitts during a 1958 game against Calgary. Van Pelt led the Blue Bombers to the Grey Cup championship. He scored a record 22 points (two touchdowns, two field goals and four extra points) in the 1958 Grey Cup championship game, as the Blue Bombers defeated the Hamilton Tiger- Cats 35-28. Van Pelt's first touchdown came on a trick play when he pitched the ball to halfback Leo Lewis and then took a pass from Lewis to run untouched 29 yards into the end zone. His second touchdown was a game-winning touchdown in the fourth quarter‚Äîa one-yard run that gave the Bombers a 35-28 lead. In its game coverage, The Montreal Gazette reported: > Jimmy Van Pelt, a freshman import quarterback from the University of > Michigan was the producer, director and principal actor in Winnipeg's > unexpected decision over the defending champions. He scored 22 points for a > new Grey Cup record. ... Van Pelt took over as the stream-lined Grey Cup > hero ... the country's national football pin-up boy. The Flying Dutchman > grabbed a surprise pass from Leo Lewis for one touchdown, plunged over > center from one yard out for another. During the 1958 season, Van Pelt completed 90 of 160 passes for 1,445 yards, nine touchdowns and ten interceptions. In August 1959, Van Pelt dislocated a bone in his left hand during an exhibition game featuring a rematch of the Grey Cup championship game between Winnipeg and Hamilton. Despite the injury, Van Pelt was the starting quarterback in Winnipeg's season opener against the British Columbia Lions. Wearing a cast on his left wrist, Van Pelt scored 27 points as he threw three touchdown passes with his right hand, rushed for a fourth touchdown and kicked a field goal. Van Pelt led the Winnipeg team to another western division championship in 1959, but he suffered a shoulder separation late in the season. Before suffering the injury, Van Pelt was having the best year of his career. During the 1959 season, he completed 160 of 300 passes for 2,706 yards, 31 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. He also set a Western Conference record by throwing seven touchdown passes in a single game against the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Winnipeg coach Bud Grant noted, \\"Until Van Pelt was injured, I was pretty sure we had a better team than the 1958 champions. ... For 32 games Van Pelt played 99 percent of the time at quarterback. ... Before he was injured Jim had the team moving real well.\\" Winnipeg went on to win its second consecutive Grey Cup championship with Kenny Ploen playing quarterback in the championship game. Van Pelt's football career was cut short when he was drafted into the United States Air Force in the summer of 1960 for a three-year period of service. In November 1962, Van Pelt, then a lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force, watched the Blue Bombers defend their Grey Cup championship as the guest of the club. Winnipeg general manager Jim Ausley would have Van Pelt back \\"if he wants to play football again.\\" In June 1963, Van Pelt announced that he would not resume his football career after his discharge from the Air Force. Van Pelt said he planned to take an accounting job in Chicago. In an interview with the Winnipeg Tribune, he explained, \\"My wife and I talked it over for a long time and decided the job in Chicago was the best move.\\" ==References== Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:American players of Canadian football Category:Canadian football quarterbacks Category:Grey Cup champions Category:Michigan Wolverines football players Category:Players of American football from Illinois Category:Sportspeople from Chicago Category:Winnipeg Blue Bombers players ","title":"Jim Van Pelt"},{"id":"20178681","text":"Trata pri Velesovem () is a village in the Municipality of Cerklje na Gorenjskem in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia. ==Name== The name of the settlement was changed from Trata to Trata pri Velesovem in 1953.Spremembe naselij 1948‚Äì95. 1996.

However, the death of Mills in 1949 put a hold on the project, with his successor Charles Clarke, taking up the project on his appointment later that year. Mills had requested Beyer, Peacock & Co to reserve capacity for their construction when the design was first proposed, however, by the time Clarke took over, Beyer, Peacock & Co had identified a number of possible problems with the design. This led to a meeting in the United Kingdom in 1950, the outcome of which was a substantial redesign of the locomotive. The resultant locomotive included many proprietary boiler and ancillary fittings, as well as parts interchange ability. The firebox was substantially altered to take into account the properties of Collie coal. This included a combustion chamber, thermic syphons and arch bar tubes. The running gear was based heavily on Beyer, Peacock & Co's Standard Light Garratt, which was built for the South Australian Railways as its 400 class. The first 40 were delivered partially erected, whilst the final 20 were fully assembled prior to shipping. The last 20 had larger tenders, capable of holding an additional . All were delivered between April 1951 and June 1952. ==Operational history== W901 at East Perth Locomotive Depot in 1951 The light axle load of the W class, 9.5t, gave it availability across the entire WAGR Network. Although essentially a freight engine, the W class regularly hauled The Australind from Perth to Bunbury. It effectively replaced the aged O and G classes still working on lighter parts of the network. The class had a reputation for being free steamers and strong pullers. Although they have a well-deserved reputation for their reliability, like any new class the W locos suffered some minor teething problems, including ashpan failures, and leaks in and around the foundation ring. The leaks were traced to faulty welding. The class suffered from stay failures in its early days, particularly in and around the throat plate. The first to fail was W913 in 1952. At one point, no fewer than 34 of the class were in Midland Railway Workshops or regional depots for stay repair. The problem was traced back to the thermic syphons creating significant water movement in the area, overstressing the boiler plates, as well as problems with the quality of the original stays. The syphons were progressively removed over a seven-year period, eliminating the problem. Following the modification, the last of which was made in 1959, the class gave excellent service. As dieselisation of WAGR continued, the class was gradually moved to the southern parts of the network. Withdrawals commenced in 1968 with the last condemned in 1972. Most of the class was scrapped in 1971, although 19 were held in reserve at Midland Railway Workshops until 1972.W Class Steam Locomotive Rail Heritage WA The last few remained at Midland until 1980. ==Sister Locomotives== Beyer, Peacock & Co built four additional engines to the same design for the Silverton Tramway Company, designated as its W class. ==Preservation== W920 on the Hotham Valley Railway in July 2005 The light axle load of the W class along with their relative youth resulted in them being sought after by tourist operators, both in Western Australia and interstate with 18 preserved. Today they form the backbone of the Hotham Valley Railway and Pichi Richi Railway fleets with each having three operational examples.

Arena Kecil (Little Arena) is where readers can tell their fun and memorable experiences, while Tak Disangka (Unexpected) is a place where readers can tell embarrassing and funny experiences. *Kreatif: This page is filled with an art suggestion each week. It has been put there since Kreatif Magazines (by Kompas Gramedia Group) was not published anymore. *Potret Negeriku (The Portrait Of My Nation), features about specific parts of Indonesia. *Keliling Dunia (Travel Around the World) is somehow like Potret Negeriku, but specifies on a place outside Indonesia. *Ensiklo Bobo : this part filled with interesting fact from around the world, usually about science, math, or history. *Sayembara Bobo (Bobo Quiz) : a quiz part usually in form of crossword quiz, kid can deliver right answer to Bobo Publisher for getting a chance to win a prize (usually in form of money or sponsored items) There are several yearly events organized by Bobo magazine in Indonesia and is held at Jakarta and Surabaya: Bobo Fair, which has fun activities meant for the readers, and Operet Bobo, which is held every year until it was discontinued and joined with the Bobo Fair.

The number of pages differed from 8 to 24 and the format was 15√ó23 cm. ==History and content== The editor was Isaac Mitrani, articles were written in Judeo-Spanish in Rashi letters, and it basically brought ‚Äúnational news, Jewish history, religious education, very interesting stories‚Äù (novedades nasyonales, istorya de los ƒëudeos, sensya reli≈æyoza, kuentos muy kuryozos), as stated on the cover page. The magazine was decidedly Zionist-oriented, called for Jewish unity and the creation of a Jewish state. News usually concerned the persecution of Jews in Europe and appeals for help. Literary texts described themes from history or prominent persons from that time. The magazine did not have a precise publishing schedule, but depended on subscription payments. For example, the second issue of the third year was published at the beginning of spring 1906, on Purim, and the third one not before the beginning of summer of that year. At the end of that issue, the editorial board wrote an apology (Eskuza) in which they asked for understanding for the delay and informed their audience that timely subscription payments would enable bi-monthly publishing. Although the magazine was printed in Belgrade, the editorial board moved from one city to another. It shows how the state boundaries did not represent any kind of obstacle and that the circulation of Jews among their communities throughout the Balkans went undisturbed. The editor of the second issue in the third year was Isaac Mitrani from Belgrade, while the editor of the third number of the same year was his relative Barouh Mitrani from Sofia. ==Donations== In one of the articles, the editorial board acknowledges the receipt of donations and appeals to readers to donate. It proves that the destiny of the magazine depended solely on its readers. This text also evinces that the magazine was read throughout the Balkan Peninsula: To our friends in Belgrade! We thank you for your promises: the anonymous reader who helped us with the costs of this number! We praise him from the depth of our heart, hoping the others would do the same!

Bennetts Water Gardens is an garden in Chickerell, near Weymouth, Dorset, in southern England. It holds national and international collections of water lilies which flower from late May through to September. The plants are displayed in a series of ponds and lakes. A main feature of the garden is a blue Japanese bridge built in 1999 to celebrate 100 years since Claude Monet painted his famous piece Water Lily Pond 1899. The site was originally a clay pit as far back as 1859. Oxford Clay was dug by hand from the ground for brickmaking.

The brownback trevally is distributed in two populations through the tropical waters of the Indo-west Pacific region, ranging from the Persian Gulf east to India, South East Asia and the Indonesian islands. The species is distinguished from similar species by its completely scaled breast and black-tipped second dorsal fin, and is known to reach a maximum length of 25 cm. The brownback trevally inhabits inshore waters including bays and estuaries, where it preys on demersal crustaceans and small fish. Other aspects of its biology are poorly known, and it is of minor importance to fisheries, occasionally caught by hook and line or trawls. William Smith-Vaniz has recently suggested the two distinct populations may actually represent two distinct species. ==Taxonomy and naming== The brownback trevally is classified within the genus Carangoides, one of a number of groups of fish referred to as jacks and trevallies. Carangoides falls into the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, the Carangidae are part of the order Carangiformes. The species was first scientifically described by an unknown author in a publication entitled 'Memoir of the Life and Public Services of Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles', in which a chapter was dedicated to fish specimens Raffles had collected. The author is usually presumed to be the English zoologist Edward Turner Bennett, but due to a lack of evidence to support this, his name is placed in parentheses as required by the ICZN code. The species was here published under the name of Caranx praeustus, with the holotype collected from Sumatra, Indonesia. This classification was later changed to the genus Carangoides by Pieter Bleeker, where it has remained. Two junior synonyms have been applied to the species, Caranx ire and Caranx melanostethos, which are invalid under ICZN rules. The species specific epithet praeustus is Latin; meaning \\"burnt at the tip\\", in reference to its black dorsal lobe. In the last revision of the carangids of the Indo-Pacific, William Smith-Vaniz found that the two separate populations have differing gill raker counts and breast squamation, leading him to suggest the possibility of these being two separate species. If further study indicates these are two separate species, the name Carangoides ire should be reinstated, as Georges Cuvier described a fish from this second western Indian Ocean population as Caranx ire. ==Description== An anglers catch of brownback trevallyThe brownback trevally is a relatively small species of carangid, growing to a maximum recorded length of 25 cm, but is much more common at lengths less than 16 cm. The species has a similar body profile to other trevallies in the same genus, having an elongate, compressed form with the dorsal and ventral profiles approximately equal in convexity. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first consisting of 8 spines while the second has 1 spine and 21 to 24 soft rays, with both dorsal fins of approximately equal height. The anal fin has two anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine and 18 to 20 soft rays. The lateral line has a moderate anterior arch, with the straight and arched sections being nearly equal in length. The straight part of the lateral line has 4 to 12 scales followed by 23 to 34 scutes. The breast is nearly completely scaled, occasionally having a partially naked midventral area, which rarely extends the entire length of the breast. In the western population, all individuals have this narrow naked midventral area extending the entire length of the breast. Both jaws have an irregular row of small conical teeth, with the upper jaw also having a narrow band of teeth anteriorly. The gill raker count also varies between the two populations, with the eastern population having 32 to 37 in total, while the western population has 40 to 47. There are 24 vertebrae. The brownback trevally is silvery blue-grey dorsally, shading to silvery underneath, sometimes with a broad brassy midlateral zone. There is no dark opercular spot. The distal area of the second dorsal fin lobe is strongly black, usually with a white tip while the remainder of the fin is dusky. The caudal fin is yellow and all other fins are whitish to hyaline. ==Distribution and habitat== The brownback trevally is distributed in two distinct populations in the tropical waters of the Indo-west pacific region. The western population extends from the waters of Iran in the Persian Gulf to the Bay of Bengal off Bangladesh, with records also from the Maldives and Sri Lanka. The eastern population inhabits a wide region in the South East Asian and Indonesian region, from the Gulf of Thailand to Borneo, Philippines and Indonesia. The brownback trevally is a coastal species, inhabiting both rocky and coral reefs, as well as bay and estuary environments. The species prefers calm, sheltered waters. ==Biology and fishery== The biology of the brownback trevally is known only from a single research study on its diet, and observational evidence recorded by divers. The study was located in the South China Sea, and focused on the diets of two species of sillaginids, with investigations into the trophic relationships of fish in the region. It was found the brownback trevally primarily consumes shrimps, with lesser amounts of calanoid copepods and small fish also taken. Observations indicate the fish form schools of up to 13 fish, which patrol reefs, and are inquisitive of divers. In Hong Kong waters, the fish is present from April to October, with a darkening of the fishes colour appearing to indicate spawning occurs in September at this locality. The brownback trevally is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range, often taken as bycatch in various trawling and hook and line operations. It is generally not distinguished from other trevally species, and no catch statistics are reported. It is also often taken by small artisanal fisheries by various inshore fish traps. ==References *Brownback trevally at Fishbase *Factsheet and picture brownback trevally Category:Marine fauna of South Asia brownback trevally ","title":"Brownback trevally"},{"id":"20178911","text":"Vrhovje () is a small settlement in the Municipality of Cerklje na Gorenjskem in the Upper Carniola region of Slovenia.

It is cruciform in shape, with chancel, the first part to be built, nave south and north transepts, and a tower. A spire, one of the tallest in Europe was added in the 14th century with a total height of 200 feet. It is topped by a gilded weather vane. The church is built from the local clunch stone and flint with some addition of Roman bricks. The architecture is Norman throughout apart from porches added in the 14th and 15th centuries. A 19th century vestry was added on the north east corner. In 1302 a cell to Ashridge Priory was founded in Hemel Hempstead and the church had collegiate status until the Dissolution of the monasteries in 1536. A door at the base of the tower allowed the monks access to the church and avoided them mixing with the townspeople. It is not known why such a grand church was constructed in what at the time was a small hamlet. The church contains a memorial to Sir Astley Paston Cooper. There is a Walker organ which was refurbished in 2008. A ring of five bells was recorded in the reign of Edward VI. None of these remain and the present ring is of 8 bells dating from 1590 to 1767. In 1950, as part of the 800th anniversary, the bells were retuned by Gillett and Johnston of Croydon and rehung on steel frames with completely new fittings.

His uncle, also Charles Rainsford (died 1778), was deputy lieutenant of the Tower of London and used his influence to get him made second cornet in General Bland's 3rd dragoons in March 1744, a unit at that time active in the Flanders theatre of the War of the Austrian Succession. Rainsford joined it immediately, carrying its standard at Fontenoy and soon after being appointed ensign in the Coldstream Guards. With his new unit he returned to England to face the Jacobite rising, rising to major of brigade and colonel's aide-de-camp. He then served as private secretary to Tyrawley, governor of Gibraltar (1756‚Äì7) before returning to England again in 1760. The following year he was given a company to command under Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick in Germany, before re-joining Tyrawley as aide-de-camp, brigadier-general and chief engineer in 1762 to face the threatened Spanish invasion of Portugal. Ordered home in 1763, with promotion second major in the Grenadier Guards and equerry to William, duke of Gloucester (1766‚Äì80), he commanded the army detachment at the king's bench prison at Southwark after the May 1768 riot. He also served as MP for Maldon (1772‚Äì74) until his patron William Nassau de Zuylestein, 4th Earl of Rochford's nephew and heir was elected. He also held Bere Alston (1787‚Äì88) thanks to help from Algernon Percy, Lord Lovaine (brother of Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland), leaving it over the Regency Bill, with Lovaine backing the government, but Gloucester and Northumberland opposing it. He was rewarded by Northumberland with Newport, Cornwall (1790‚Äì96), before leaving parliament. He had taken little part in parliamentary proceedings, serving at the same time as governor of Chester (1776‚Äì96), king's aide-de-camp (1777‚Äì82), commander of the troops stationed in Hyde Park and then Blackheath against the Gordon Riots (1780) and nominal commander of the Menorca garrison (1782, though it surrendered to the Spanish before he arrived to take up the post). He was also elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1779 (he was also a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, a Rosicrucian, a freemason and a dabbler in alchemy). In 1782 Rainsford and Benedict Chastanier reached out to kindred Illuminist groups in Berlin and Paris by publishing a brochure in French about degrees of the Universal Society. In summer 1783 Rainsford and William Bousie, an Anglo- French merchant, began corresponding with the Parisian lodge of the Philal√©thes, preparatory to the Philal√©thes convention in Paris in April 1785 to review the rites of many para-Masonic and esoteric societies. Rainsford provided information on Emanuel Swedenborg, Baal Shem of London and the Kabbalistic symbolism of higher degrees. He was then sent to be Robert Boyd's second-in-command at Gibraltar on the outbreak of Britain's war with Revolutionary France, and took over after Boyd's death as Governor (1794‚Äì95). On his return to England he became governor of Cliff Fort, Tynemouth, his last active posting. On his death in London in 1809 he was buried in a vault in the chancel of the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower of London, alongside his first wife, his father and his uncle Charles. ==Marriages and issue== #on 18 July 1775 Elizabeth (1758‚Äì1781), daughter of Edward Miles #on 16 February 1789, Ann Cornwallis (d. 1 February 1798), youngest daughter of Sir William More Molyneux of Loseley Park, Guildford ‚Äì the marriage remained childless.

Dalgleish was one of the first British traders in Ladakh, engaged in trans-Karakoram trade in the 1870s and 1880s. He married a Yarkandi wife. He had for some years traded between Yarkand and Leh and he was fluent in Uyghur.Hamilton Bower. A trip to Turkistan. Geographical Journal. 1895. pp. 241-257 Dalgleish was murdered by an Afghan named Dad Mahomed, a Kakar Pathan from Quetta who was once a merchant but had gone bankrupt. According to Hamilton Bower, in May 1888 Dalgleish, accompanied by some pilgrims and servants, left Leh for Yarkand. Several days into their journey they were joined by Mahomed. On 8 April 1888 the party crossed the Karakoram Pass and set up some tents to rest. While drinking tea in a tent Dalgleish and Mahomed had a conversation regarding Mahomed's debts. Mahomed excused himself and then returned with a gun and fired into the tent, striking Dalgleish in the shoulder. Dalgleish escaped from the tent but Mahomed pursued him with a sword and killed him. Mahomed did not immediately flee but instead forced Dalgleish's servants to make him a meal, then he slept in his victim's tent. The next day Mahomed departed and Dalgleish's servants and pilgrims made their way to Yarkand. The British community in Yarkand expressed their outrage over the murder and pleaded with the local yamen to have the murderer arrested. Mahomed later arrived in Kashgar and despite pleas from the Russian Consul Nikolai Petrovsky local officials refused to arrest Mahomed. During his travels through Qing China's Xinjiang Province from 1889‚Äì90, British military officer Hamilton Bower attempted without success to pursue Dalgleish's killer. Mahomed was arrested in 1890 in Samarkand (then Russia) and committed suicide in prison. A small memorial made of marble slab was erected by Bower on the desolate site of his death.

Boyd was a witness at the subsequent court-martial at which Byng was tried for the loss of the garrison. He subsequently became commissary general to the Marquess of Granby in Germany (1758 to 1759); he then rose through the officer ranks to be three-times Governor of Gibraltar (1776 to 1777, 1790 and 1790 to 1794). Boyd considered that his and General Sir William Green's work on the King's Bastion in Gibraltar was so important that he asked to be buried there. The site of his burial is not indicated but his body is lost under cement used to strengthen the building still further in the 19th century. A memorial stone was placed within the King's Chapel but the marble stone in the King's Bastion read: > Within the walls of this bastion are deposited the mortal remains of the > late General Sir Robert Boyd, K.B., governor of this fortress, who died on > 13 May 1794, aged 84 years.

A French force under the command of the Duke de Richelieu landed on the island and besieged the British garrison at St. Philip's Castle, forcing them to surrender after a lengthy siege. A British relief force under Admiral John Byng sailed with the purpose of saving the island, but after the naval Battle of Minorca, Byng withdrew to Gibraltar, and the resistance of the garrison finally collapsed. Byng was later blamed for the loss of Menorca (historically called \\"Minorca\\" by the British), and executed by firing squad. One involved in the British navy in this operation was Arthur Phillip, later to be first Governor of New South Wales. The garrison's resistance had been considered lengthy and honourable enough for them to be allowed to march out carrying their arms and be shipped back home to Britain, a common convention at the time. Blakeney was absolved of any blame for the loss of the island, and was later awarded an Irish peerage in recognition of his defence of Fort St Phillip. ==Aftermath== Hyacinthe Ga√´tan de Lannion was appointed the first French Governor of Menorca. A British naval squadron led by Sir Edward Hawke sent out to replace Byng, arrived off Menorca shortly after the surrender. As Hawke did not have enough troops on board to land and mount a siege to retake the island he departed, cruising in the waters off Marseilles for three months before sailing home. He was later criticised for failing to mount a blockade of the island, which might have forced it to surrender through starvation.Pope p.193-94 The French held on to Menorca for the remainder of the war, the only British territory they were to occupy, and at the Treaty of Paris it was returned to Britain in exchange for Guadeloupe. Menorca was captured from the British again in 1781 during the Anglo-Spanish War, after which it was ceded to Spain. ==See also== * Great Britain in the Seven Years' War ==ReferencesBibliography== * Anderson, Fred.

The Bullcroft Colliery Company was formed in April 1908 and sinking of the shafts commenced immediately. In January 1909, at a depth of , a water course yielding over per minute was struck, it was capped back and sinking continued but only a month later, at , another water course, big enough to be described as a \\"subterranean river\\", was struck - too much for the steam operated pumps to cope with. Electric pumps were brought in to cope with the flow but even with a capability of per minute they couldn't cope and sinking was stopped so the full situation could be assessed. It was decided to withdraw the pumps and freeze the ground. Commencing January 1910 the first freeze was unsuccessful and a second, after the shafts had iron \\"tubbing\\" installed, commenced in February 1911. This was successful, and sinking recommenced finally reaching the coal measures in December 1911 at below the surface. Before the colliery company arrived, the nearby settlement of Carcroft consisted of only 50 houses. By 1910, an additional 400 houses had been erected to cope with the influx of miners and their families. Between 1908 and 1940 the company traded as Bullcroft Main Colliery Ltd. It merged with five other collieries (Brodsworth, Hickleton, Markham Main and Yorkshire Main) in 1940 to form the Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd. In 1947, the enterprise was nationalised into British Coal. The colliery worked normally until 1968 when it was joined to Brodsworth Colliery by a drift and a long conveyor made it possible that Bullcroft coal could be brought up at Brodsworth for washing etc. The collieries officially merged in 1970, with the final shift clocking off on 25 September of that year. As the last remaining seam could be reached via the Brodsworth Colliery, the Bullcroft shafts were filled, using spoil from pit heaps and capped. Bullcroft Colliery kept its landsale depot to deal with concessionary coal and retained a locomotive to work it for about a year afterwards. The colliery was served by a branch off the Hull and Barnsley and Great Central Joint Railway and a connection to the West Riding and Grimsby Railway. The colliery had its own football team, which competed in the FA Cup on numerous occasions. The of land that the colliery occupied above ground is now used as a community parkland. There was a proposal in 2013 to sift the spoil for usable coal. However, the price of coal fell soon afterwards and the plan was abandoned. The local community want the area to be landscaped and the spoil tip removed as has happened at other neighbouring collieries such as Askern, Bentley and Brodsworth. ==Accidents== *13 January 1937 - Kenneth Oliver, 14, was killed in accident whilst he was uncoupling tubs from the internal conveyor system. Oliver was under adult supervision, but his death lead to questions being raised in Parliament about boys working in mines. *19 October 1941 - six men died whilst trying to deal with problems within the mine. An ignition of gas just after 3:00 am caused an explosion and killed the men outright. They were about distant from the shaft bottom and all, bar one, had been members of the mine rescue team. == References == * Colliery Company records.

For instance, the price of a good, the time of its promised delivery and the description of the good will all be terms of the contract. ==What are terms== A contractual \\"[a]ny provision forming part of a contract\\"Martin, E [ed] & Law, J [ed], Oxford Dictionary of Law, ed6 (2006, London:OUP). Each term gives rise to a contractual obligation, breach of which can give rise to litigation. Not all terms are stated expressly and some terms carry less legal gravity as they are peripheral to the objectives of the contract. *Condition or Warranty.Not to be confused with a product warranty, which is always referred to as a 'guarantee' in law. Conditions are terms which go to the very root of a contract. Breach of these terms repudiate the contract, allowing the other party to discharge the contract. A warranty is not so imperative so the contract will subsist after a breach. Breach of either will give rise to damages. It is an objective matter of fact whether a term goes to the root of a contract. By way of illustration, an actress' obligation to perform the opening night of a theatrical production is a condition,Poussard v Spiers and Pond (1876) 1 QBD 410 whereas a singers obligation to perform during the first three days of rehearsal is a warranty.Bettini v Gye (1876) 1 QBD 183 Statute may also declare a term or nature of term to be a condition or warranty; for example the Sale of Goods Act 1979 s15AAs added by the Sale of Goods Act 1994 s4(1). provides that terms as to title, description, quality and sample (as described in the Act) are conditions save in certain defined circumstances. *Innominate term. Lord Diplock, in Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd,[1962] 1 All ER 474 created the concept of an innominate term, breach of which may or not go to the root of the contract depending upon the nature of the breach. breach of these terms, as with all terms, will give rise to damages. Whether or not it repudiates the contract depends upon whether legal benefit of the contract has been removed from the innocent party. Megaw LJ, in 1970, preferred the use of the classic categorising into condition or warranty due to legal certainty.Maredelanto Compania Naviera SA v Bergbau-Handel GmbH, The Mihalis Angelos [1970] 3 All ER 125. This was interpreted by the House of Lords as merely restricting its application in Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Hansen-Tangen.[1976] 3 All ER 570 ===Status as a term=== Status as a term is important as a party can only take legal action for the non fulfillment of a term as opposed to representations or mere puffs. Legally speaking, only statements that amount to a term create contractual obligations. Statements can be split into the following types: * Puff (sales talk): If no reasonable person hearing this statement would take it seriously, it is a puff, and no action in contract is available if the statement proves to be wrong. It may also be referred to as \\"puffery\\". This is common in television commercials. * Representation: A representation is a statement of fact which does not amount to a term of the contract but it is one that the maker of the statement does not guarantee its truth. This gives rise to no contractual obligation but may amount to a tort, for example misrepresentation. * Term: A term is similar to a representation, but the truth of the statement is guaranteed by the person who made the statement therefore giving rise to a contractual obligation. For the purposes of Breach of Contract a term may further be categories as a condition, warranty or innominate term. There are various factors that a court may take into account in determining the nature of a statement. These include: * Timing: If the contract was concluded soon after the statement was made, this is a strong indication that the statement induced the person to enter into the contract. Lapse of a week within the negotiations of a car sale was held to amount only to a representation in Routledge v McKay[1954] 1 All ER 855 * Content of statement: It is necessary to consider what was said in the given context, which has nothing to do with the importance of a statement. * Knowledge and expertise: In Oscar Chess Ltd v Williams,[1957] 1 WLR 370 a person selling a car to a second-hand car dealer stated that it was a 1948 Morris, when in fact it was a 1939 model car. It was held that the statement did not become a term because a reasonable person in the position of the car dealer would not have thought that an inexperienced person would have guaranteed the truth of the statement. * Reduction into Writing: Where the contract is consolidated into writing, previous spoken terms, omitted from the consolidation, will probably be relegated to representations.Routledge v McKay [1954] 1 All ER 855 The old case of Birch v Paramount Estates Ltd(1856) 16 EG 396 provided that a very important spoken term may persist even if omitted from the written consolidation; this case concerned the quality of a residential house. The parol evidence rule limits what things can be taken into account when trying to interpret a contract. This rule has practically ceased operation under UK law, but remains functional in Australian Law. ==Implied terms== A term may either be expressed or implied. An Express term is stated by the parties during negotiation or written in a contractual document. Implied terms are not stated but nevertheless form a provision of the contract. ===Terms implied in fact=== The Privy Council established a five stage test in BP Refinery (Westernport) Pty Ltd v Shire of Hastings:. # Reasonableness and equitableness: The implied term must be reasonable and equitable. # Business efficacy: The implied term must be necessary for the business efficacy of the contract. For instance, if the term simply causes the contract to operate better, that does not fit this criterion. This is the principle laid out in The Moorcock.(1889)14 P.D. 64 The presiding judge created a quaint concept of an officious bystander; if the officious bystander were to propose a term and both the parties would be likely to reply \\"oh, of course\\", the term is implied. # Obviousness: The term is so obvious that it goes without saying. Furthermore, there must be one and only one thing that would be implied by the parties. For example, in Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of New South Wales,. a term regarding the inability of construction company to work three shifts a day could not be implied because it was unclear what form it would have taken. In English Law, This principle was established in the case of Spring v NASDS,[1956] 1 W.L.R. 585 in the context of a Trade Union membership contract. # Clear expression: The term must be capable of clear expression. No specific technical knowledge should be required. # Consistency: The implied term may not contradict an express term. In Australia, the High Court has ruled that the test in BP Refinery applies only to formal contracts, while the test in Byrne and Frew v Australian Airlines Ltd. shall apply to informal contracts: * Necessity: The term must be necessary to ensure reasonable or effective operation of a contract of the nature before the court. * Consistency: The implied term may not contradict an express term (same as for formal contracts). * Clear expression: The term must be capable of clear expression (same as for formal contracts). * Obvious: McHugh and Gummow JJ have stated that it must also be obvious. ===Terms implied in law=== These are terms that have been implied into standardised relationships. Common law. *Liverpool City Council v Irwin[1976] 2 WLR 562 established a term to be implied into all contracts between tenant and landlord that the landlord is obliged to keep the common areas in a reasonable state of repair. *Wong Mee Wan v Kwan Kin Travel Services Ltd[1995] 4 All ER 745 established that when a tour operator contracts to for the sale of goods. The most important legislation under United Kingdom law is the Sale of Goods Act 1979, the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 which imply terms into all contracts whereby goods are sold or services provided. These terms will be implied into all contracts of the same nature as a matter of law. Statutory. The rules by which many contracts are governed are provided in specialized statutes that deal with particular subjects. Most countries, for example, have statutes which deal directly with sale of goods, lease transactions, and trade practices. For example, each American state except Louisiana has adopted Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which regulates contracts for the sale of goods.For links and comparison among states on the adoption of the UCC, see Cornell Law Uniform Laws. The most important legislation implying terms under United Kingdom law are the Sale of Goods Act 1979, the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 and the Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 which imply terms into all contracts whereby goods are sold or services provided. ===Terms implied by custom or trade=== One is generally bound by the custom of the industry that one is in. To imply a term due to custom or trade, one must prove the existence of the custom, which must be notorious, certain, legal and reasonable..Frigaliment Importing Co Ltd v BNS International Sales Corp, 190 F. Supp. 116 (S.D.N.Y. 1960) (plaintiff failed to prove what he meant by \\"chicken\\") and U.C.C. ¬ß 1-205. ===Course of dealing=== If two parties have regularly conduct business on certain terms, the terms may be assumed to be same for each contract made, if not expressly agreed to the contrary. The parties must have dealt on numerous occasions and been aware of the term purported to be implied. In Hollier v Rambler Motors Ltd[1972] QB 71 four occasions over five years was held to be sufficient. In British Crane Hire Corp Ltd v Ipswich Plant Hire Ltd[1975] QB 303 written terms were held to have been implied into an oral in which there was no mention of written terms. ===Good faith=== It is common for lengthy negotiations to be written into a heads of agreement document that includes a clause to the effect that the rest of the agreement is to be negotiated. Although these cases may appear to fall into the category of agreement to agree, Australian courts will imply an obligation to negotiate in good faith provided that certain conditions are satisfiedCoal Cliff Collieries Pty Ltd v Sijehama Pty Ltd (1991) 24 NSWLR 1. LawCite records. * Negotiations were well- advanced and the large proportion of terms have been worked out; and * There exists some mechanism to resolve disputes if the negotiations broke down. The test of whether one has acted in good faith is a subjective one; the cases suggest honesty, and possibly also reasonably. There is no general obligation to act in good faith term under English contract law: an attempt was made by Lord Denning in a series of case during the 70s and 80s but they are no longer considered 'good law'. European legislation imposes this duty, but only in certain circumstances. For the circumstances when an obligation of good faith may in certain circumstances be implied see Yam Seng PTE Ltd v International Trade Corporation Ltd.http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2013/111.html The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999SI 1999/2083 reg 8 will render ineffective any 'unfair' contractual term if made between a seller or supplier and a consumer.For definitions, see reg 3(1). Regulation 5 of the Statutory Instrument further elaborates upon the concept of 'unfair', which is rather novel to English law. 'Unfair' is a term that was not individually negotiated (i.e. standard form) that \\"causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract to the detriment of the consumer\\".Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 reg 5(1) This is not possible if the term is not contrary to 'good faith'; such as in Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank,[2001] 3 WLR 1297 wherein the lack of a seemingly unfair interest term would leave the bank open to a very poor deal whereby no interest could be charged. ==\\"Subject to\\" contracts== If a contract specifies \\"subject to contract\\", it may fall into one of three categories:. # The parties are immediately bound to the bargain, but they intend to restate the deal in a formalised contract that will not have a different effect; or # The parties have completely agreed to the terms, but have made the execution of some terms in the contract conditional on the creation of a formalised contract; or # It is merely an agreement to agree, and the deal will not be concluded until the formalised contract has been drawn up. Subsequent authorities have been willing to recognize a fourth category in addition to those stated in Masters v Cameron.Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v GR Securities Pty Ltd (1986) 40 NSWLR 622 LawCite records. # * The parties intend to immediately bound by the terms agreed upon and expect to create a further contract as a replacement for the initial contract which will contain additional terms (if agreed upon). If a contract specifies \\"subject to finance\\", it imposes obligations on the purchaser:. * The purchaser must seek finance; and * When offers of finance arrive, the purchaser must make a decision as to whether the offers of finance are suitable. This may also refer to contingent conditions, which come under two categories: condition precedent and condition subsequent. Conditions precedent are conditions that have to be complied with before performance of a contract With conditions subsequent, parties have to perform until the condition is not met. Failure of a condition repudiates the contract this is not to necessarily discharge it. Repudiation will always gives rise to an action for damages. ==Notes== Category:English contract law Category:Legal documents Category:Contract clauses pt:Cl√°usula ","title":"Contractual terms in English law"},{"id":"20179126","text":"Dr C.A.Hewavitharana.

He also established the Annual World Wireless Message to Children in 1922, and was the first person to broadcast in Welsh, on St David's Day 1923. ==Life== Davies was born on 24 March 1879 at Bedlinog, Glamorgan, in south Wales, to D. J. Davies, a local Baptist minister. He was educated at the grammar school in Llandeilo before training for ordination at the Midland Baptist College in Nottingham. He then won a scholarship to Jesus College, Oxford. He was ordained in 1906, serving first at Broadhaven in Pembrokeshire and then, between 1908 and 1915, in Carmarthen. With encouragement from David Davies (later Lord Davies of Llandinam), he helped to set up the Welsh School of Social Service in 1911. He served as secretary, chairman and president. Between 1915 and 1919, he was the minister in Abergavenny and then he ministered in Llandrindod Wells between 1919 and 1922. In 1922, he retired from active ministry and spent the rest of his life promoting world peace. He travelled extensively, spending much of his time in Geneva and Cardiff. He established the Annual World Wireless Message to Children in 1922, a message of peace from the youth of Wales to the youth of the world. On St David's Day (1 March) 1923, Davies became the first person to broadcast in the Welsh language. He was the co-founder (with Lord Davies) and honorary director (1922 to 1945) of the Welsh branch of the League of Nations Union, and honorary international secretary of the Union until the League of Nations was dissolved. He organised annual conferences on international education at Gregynog between 1922 and 1939. During the Second World War, he directed the Welsh Education Committee as it drafted a model constitution for an international education organisation, and his draft was influential in the creation of Unesco. After the Second World War, Davies supported the work of the United Nations and Unesco, becoming the first president of the Welsh National Council of the United Nations Association and helping to establish the Welsh Unesco Committee. He wrote articles for journals and newspapers, some of which were collected as ' (\\"The World Yesterday and Today\\") (1938). He also wrote International Education in the Schools of Wales and Monmouthshire (1926), The Ordeal of Geneva (1933), and Intellectual co-operation between the Wars (1943), as well as The Gregynog Conferences on International Education 1922-37 (1952).

It is estimated that more than US$160 billion of Range Accrual indexed on interest rates only have been sold to investors between 2004 and 2007.Mtn-I Publication 2007 It is one of the most popular non-vanilla financial derivatives. In essence the investor in a range accrual is \\"betting\\" that the reference \\"index\\" - usually interest rates or currency exchange rates - will stay within a predefined range. == Payoff description == A general expression for the payoff of a range accrual is: : P \\\\times \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} 1_{\\\\text{index}(i) \\\\in \\\\text{Range}} \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{N} * index(i) is the value of the index at the ith observation date * N is the total number of observations within a period * P is the payout when the index is in the range If the observation frequency is daily, the payoff could be more easily written as : P \\\\times \\\\frac{n}{N} where * n is the number of days a specified index is within a given range * N is the total number of days of the observation period * P is the payout for any given day where the index is in the range The index could be an interest rate (e.g. USD 3 months Libor), or a FX rate (e.g. EUR/USD) or a commodity (e.g. oil price) or any other observable financial index. The observation period can be different from daily (e.g. weekly, monthly, etc.), though a daily observation is the most encountered. The receiver of the range accrual coupons is selling binary options. The value of these options is used to enhance the coupon paid. === Example === Let's take an example of a 5 years range accrual note linked to USD 3 months Libor, with range set as [1.00%; 6.00%] and a conditional coupon of 5.00%. Let's assume the note to start on January 1, 2009 and the first coupon payment to happen on July 1, 2009. An investor who buys USD 100m of this note will have the following cash flows: * First coupon -- Between January 1 and July 1, 2009, if USD 3m Libor fixes between 1.00% and 6.00% for 130 days, then the rate applied for the first semester will be: :5.00% √ó 130/181 = 3.5912% (there are 181 days in total between January 1, 2009 and July 1, 2009). :The coupon paid on July 1, 2009 would be: US$100m √ó 3.5912% √ó 0.5 = $1,795,600 (assuming 0.5 for the day- count fraction between January 1, 2009 and July 1, 2009) * Second coupon - Between July 1, 2009 and January 1, 2010, if USD 3m Libor fixes between 1.00% and 6.00% for 155 days, then the rate applied for the second semester will be: :5.00% √ó 155/184= 4.2120%. :The coupon paid on January 1, 2010 would be: US$100m √ó 4.2120% √ó 0.5 = $2,106,000 (assuming 0.5 for the day-count fraction between July 1, 2009 and January 1, 2010). * For the 8 following coupons, the same methodology applies. The highest rate investor will get is 5.00% and the lowest 0.00%. === Different types of range accruals === The payout (P in our notation), for each day the index is in the range, could be either a fix or variable rate. == Valuation and risks == A range accrual can be seen as a strip of binary options, with a decreasing lag between fixing date and payment date. For this reason, it is important the valuation model is well calibrated to the volatility term structure of the underlying, at least at the strikes implied by the range. If furthermore the range accrual is callable, then the valuation model also needs to take into account the dynamic between the swaption and the underlying. Accrual swaps that monitor permanence of interest rates into a range and pay a related interest rate times the permanence factor also depend on correlation across different adjacent forward rates. For the details see for example Brigo and Mercurio (2001). ==References== * Category:Investment Category:Mathematical finance Category:Options (finance) ","title":"Range accrual"},{"id":"20179564","text":"RMIT Music Collective is the music club representing all student-run musical groups at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia.RMIT Union 'Launch' Website. Accessed 12 November 2008 RMIT Music Collective is affectionately called 'RMIT Music' by its members and wider community. It is the current acting- organisation responsible for all student music collectives either by direct control or by affiliation. ==History== RMIT Music Collective was created in 2004 following the merger of the Concert Band Collective, Stage Band Collective and the RMIT Occasional Choral Society and is now one of the oldest and largest collective/clubs within RMIT University. In the beginning, the collective was small consisting of the three aforementioned collectives and a few smaller ensembles, such as the String and Flute Ensembles. Prior to 2007 most rehearsals occurred in Building 28 at the RMIT City campus, which used to be the old campus bar. Between 2007 and 2015 rehearsals were then moved to Building 57. During this time, the collective saw a prosperous time in membership growth and artistic direction. Acquisition of new instruments equipment and new branding took place. New ensembles/groups began to form as well as an increasing presence within the wider RMIT University community. Community outreach began to take place with external performances at various places in Victoria. Music camps were held during this time, where rehearsals and performances at schools and retirement villages took place. The Stage Band performed on a number of times at the Wangaratta Festival of Jazz. Between 2015 and 2017 a major shake-up occurred. Redevelopment of RMIT University buildings along Swanston Street, Melbourne saw the collective move location three times in a short space of time. Collective assets such as sheet music, instruments and equipment was spread between two storage locations. Participation and membership dropped, due to graduating key members and constant location changes. One key development was the utilisation of Kaleide Theatre, located in Building 8, Level 2, as a rehearsal space. Doing so allowed the ensembles to become a custom to the venue as it also served as bi- annual concert venue. However, once construction began in this location, the collective was moved to RMIT Building 13 (Emily McPherson Building). Here the collective struggled to maintain a good rapport with the school located there, due to issues of noise in the evening and room double bookings hampered rehearsal schedule. The collective was moved again mid-2017, returning to level 2 of the newly opened New Academic Street. In 2016 an attempt was made by the four student-run music societies RMIT Music Collective (RMIT University), Engineering Music Society (EMS) (University of Melbourne), Monash University Philharmonic Society (Monash University) and La Trobe University Music Society (La Trobe University), to create an intervarsity venture similar to AICSA developed by the university choral/choir societies. However, this did not pass the development stage. Coming out of this attempt, in 2017, representatives of the orchestras from RMIT Music and EMS created an opportunity for their members to perform early baroque/classical music in a combined orchestra to great success. Beyond 2017, RMIT Music collective has been in is a steady state of equilibrium.

RMIT Music Collective belongs to RMIT Link Arts which is the campus affixed union, separate to the student union (RUSU. The collective sits on the RMIT Arts Council and has been a member since its creation. RMIT University does not offer a music instrument degree, thus being one of the very few universities in Melbourne to have a thriving music scene outside of a music program or department. The collective consists of a number of bands including a Choir and an Orchestra. RMIT Music is located on city campus of RMIT University, Building 12, level 3, room 97 at the RMIT city campus. ===Committee=== The structure of RMIT Music Collective consists of five executive positions, ensemble managers and other music club leaders from RMIT University. The Executive branch consists of President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer and Publicity Officer. There is a position on the committee for a representative from each ensemble, group or band. Beyond the internal ensembles representation if other music clubs are created within RMIT University, they are encouraged to participate as members of the RMIT Music Collective committee. ==RMIT Music's bandsCurrent ensembles=== RMIT Concert Band The RMIT Concert Band was the first non-choral band formed as part of RMIT Union Arts.

The Stage Band performs Jazz plus anything else, as music selection is chosen by the band's members. RMIT Chamber Orchestra The original RMIT Chamber Orchestra (RMIT CO) grew out of the String Ensemble that was formed in 2005 as a quartet.

By doing so, there is opportunity for the musicians to perform in a wider variety of styles and cater to performing chamber works. Repertoire for RMIT CO centres around a wide variety of music, spreading from early renaissance to 20th Century and cinematic music.

The first training Major (TISO) was Major KW Battison of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers.Potter p27 Part of his job was to find accommodation for the various companies of the new battalion and, where possible, accommodation was sought in army bases. While the old Ulster Special Constabulary platoon huts were vacant and available, to have used those would have highlighted the continuity in personnel between the B Specials and the UDR. This reached 87% in the 4th Battalion, the highest of all UDR battalions. The battalion was initially based in the ladies' restroom of the Territorial Army centre in Enniskillen but was moved to Grosvenor Barracks, Coleshill, Enniskillen, where a new \\"hardened\\" barracks was eventually built, partially underground, to withstand mortar attack. The modified barracks was opened by Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of WestminsterPotter p345 (who had long-standing family and military connections with the area) in 1991. Most patrols from Grosvenor Barracks went out by helicopter or boat. Because of the danger of ambush, vehicles were only used in the urban area around Enniskillen. County Fermanagh is surrounded on three sides by the Republic of Ireland. Boat patrols were common as the county contains Lough Erne.Ryder p191 ==Uniform, armament & equipment== See: Ulster Defence Regiment Uniform, armament & equipment ==GreenfinchesIntimidation== Protestant and Catholic soldiers were both intimidated out of the regiment.Potter p58 Following the introduction of internment however more Catholic soldiers found themselves the subject of intimidation from within their own community. In Enniskillen one member of the conrate guard was Catholic. Some of his neighbours came to his home in the early hours of the morning and beat him as well as scrubbing his face with a hard brush. He was a frail man but was beaten black and blue and his face badly damaged by the brush. He resigned from the battalion the next day.Potter p59 ==Casualties== *On 1 March 1971, 43-year-old Thomas Fletcher (A Company) was abducted from his home at Frevagh near Garrison, County Fermanagh and killed a short distance away with 22 shots being fired into him, witnessed by his wife.Ryder p55 Within five days of this, other soldiers of the 4th Battalion who lived in the Garrison area and had been threatened by the IRA, abandoned their homes and farms near the border. *On 3 September 1971, Private Frank Veitch, aged 23, (B Company) a farmer, was on duty outside Kinawley police station. He was killed by five shots fired from a passing car.

Paige had met Rice when she was cast as Eva Per√≥n in the original stage production of his musical Evita in 1978. He also wrote lyrics for a number of the tracks on the album. Rice's former writing partner Andrew Lloyd Webber wrote the arrangement of the track \\"The Second Time\\", for which Rice had set words to Francis Lai's theme to the film Bilitis. The track \\"Secrets\\" was originally written for the Barbra Streisand album Guilty, but didn't make it on to the final record.

The battalion began its duties on 1 April 1970 with only 200 men to patrol Derry city and a further 300 to cover the rest of the county as opposed to the Ulster Special Constabulary (which the UDR replaced) figures for the previous day of 600 and 1,200 respectively.Potter p. 28 Catholic recruitment was on a par with Protestant figures however and the two city companies of 5 UDR were 50/50 in makeup, with John Hume known to have signed at least one application and told the recruit to \\"go out and find all the decent Catholic people he could to enlist\\".Potter p. 29 Sir Robin Chichester-Clark complained asked in the Parliament of the United Kingdom why one of his constituents was turned down for the force as he was a churchwarden and a local government official.Ryder p. 39 The reply by Roy Hattersley stated that the vetting team had been instructed to err on the side of caution and that two clergymen had also been refused because the new force was to be \\"isolated from political and sectarian influence\\". ===Intimidation=== Protestant and Catholic soldiers were both intimidated out of the regiment.Potter p. 58 Following the introduction of internment however more Catholic soldiers found themselves the subject of intimidation from within their own community. One captain in 5 UDR, who had been a member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association and had taken part in the Derry march, was intimidated out of the regiment, out of his job and out of Derry. The OC of the Waterside Company commented that it was \\"very, very soul destroying\\" to lose good men this way, especially when they so obviously enjoyed being soldiers in the regiment.Potter p. 59 ==History== With the other six original battalions, 5 UDR commenced operational duties on 1 April 1970. Battalion Headquarters was established at the former anti- submarine warfare school but was later moved to more suitable accommodation in Shackleton Barracks, Ballykelly, County LondonderryRyder p. 191 which they shared at various times with the Royal Air Force, the Army Air Corps and various units of the British Army. The battalion had the largest Tactical Area of Responsibility in the regiment which covered parts of two counties (Londonderry and Antrim) as well as three police divisions 1,600 square miles in total. The first commanding officer of 5 UDRGamble p. 67 was Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Bulstrode Lloyd Davidson JP, MID who had seen action in World War II as an officer with the 2nd Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. He had been Deputy Lord Lieutenant, High Sheriff for County Londonderry and later, Commandant of the City of Derry Ulster Special Constabulary between 1968 and 1970.Person Page 37972 Following his retirement after his agreed one year of service he was replaced by the battalion's first regular commanding officer, Lt Col John Lys.Potter p. 44 The second in command (2 i/c) of the battalion upon formation was Major George Lapsley, the son of a police inspector, graduate of Magee College, World War II veteran of the Royal Navy (Far Eastern campaign), and officer of the Territorial Army. He was responsible for recruitment in the early stages.Gamble pp. 58‚Äì61 The job of 2 i/c was usually given to the senior part-time officer of the battalion until 1991 when the post was changed to one for a regular officer. The first Training Major (TISO) was Major LSTH Pelham-Burn of the Coldstream Guards.Potter p. 27 Part of his job was to organise accommodation for all the companies of the new battalion. Where possible accommodation was sought in army bases and although the old Ulster Special Constabulary platoon huts were vacant and available, to have used those was politically undesirable. ==Companies== The battalion eventually had seven rifle companies which were based at: Ebrington Barracks, Derry, (A, West Bank, Coy and B, Waterside Coy), C Coy in Claudy, D Coy in Shackleton Barracks, Ballykelly, E Coy at Laurel House, Coleraine, F Coy in Magherafelt. and G Coy in Maghera.Gamble p. 68 G Coy was originally the B Coy of 1 UDR based in Ballymoney. It came under the command of 5 UDR in 1983. A further change in 1992 saw E and G Coys merge to form D Company.Gamble 2009, pp. 134‚Äì135 ===E Company=== Raised in 1971 the first Officer Commanding E Company (E Coy) was Major George Lapsley who transferred in from Battalion Headquarters.Gamble p. 66 The company was broken down into four platoons. The majority of soldiers in 21 Platoon came from Portrush, Portstewart (the Ports) and the Windyhall area of Coleraine. 22 Platoon's soldiers lived on the east side of the River Bann. 23 Platoon's men and women came from the west side of the Bann, known as \\"The Heights\\" whilst 24 Platoon recruited from Garvagh and surrounding areas.Gamble p. 70 The resulting platoon structure had soldiers from each area regular patrolling territory they were familiar with and where they knew most people from the locality. This was a hallmark of the early UDR part-timers: that they were able to tell when something was amiss in the areas they knew when out on patrol. {  - ! 21 Platoon The Ports !! 22 Platoon East Bann !! 23 Platoon West Bann !! 24 Platoon Garvagh -  No 1 Section  No 1 Section  No 1 Section  No 1 Section -  No 2 Section  No 2 Section  No 2 Section  No 2 Section -  No 3 Section  No 3 Section  No 3 Section  No 3 Section } Company headquarters was established in the former USC Drill Hall in Macosquin. After discussion with a local property owner \\"Laurel Hill House\\", built in 1843, was purchased by the Army Property Services Department for ¬£24,000 but required work in excess of ¬£100,000 to make it fit for purpose.Gamble p. 75 The house had been military accommodation in the past when it was requisitioned for the United States Army in World War II. It was also reputed to be haunted. By the time E Company took possession of the house and outbuilding they had been converted into a barracks which contained all the facilities expected to be found in UDR company and battalion locations, including a guardroom, armoury, Motor Transport (MT) section, 25 metre indoor rifle range (for .22 Long Rifle .22 calibre only), Officer's Mess, Warrant Officers and Sergeant's Mess, Junior Ranks Bar, snooker room, stores, lecture rooms, offices, operations room, sangars and a pipe range.Gamble pp. 76‚Äì77 A pipe range consists of a 30-metre section of concrete pipe of 1 metre diameter, set onto the ground and covered substantially with earth. It was used in military bases in Northern Ireland for rifle practice when surrounding buildings made it unsafe to establish an open shooting range. A helicopter pad was also established in the grounds of the house and a drill hall built close by. The drill hall also doubled as a room for large functions.Gamble p. 77 The house and 4.5 acres of grounds were placed on the market again in 2012 and sold at auction for an undisclosed sum although the guide price was listed at ¬£190,000.Laurel Hill House and site sold to a ‚Äòprivate buyer‚Äô - Local - Coleraine Times ==Uniform, armament and equipment== Initially, arms had to be drawn from the North Irish Horse barracks in Ballymoney, which by that time had become B Coy 1 UDR (see also Ulster Defence Regiment#Uniform, armament and equipment). ==GreenfinchesMusic== 5 UDR had a number of champion pipers and drummers who, apart from local performances, represented the regiment at the Horse Guards Parade, the Festival of Remembrance in the Royal Albert Hall, London, the Colchester Tattoo, the Queen's Birthday Celebrations in York, an International Air Show at Aldergove and on a tour of the British Army of the Rhine.Potter p. 382 In the World Pipe Band Championships of 1978, the pipes and drums of 5 UDR won the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association championship against 126 other entrants.Potter pp. 283‚Äì284 In the World Pipe Band Championships of 1979, competing against 260 other bands, they won both the \\"Piping and Marching\\" and \\"Discipline\\" trophies, improving on their 1978 placings of second and first respectively in those categories.Potter p. 201 The album 5 UDR Pipes & Drums \\"Irish & Scottish Pipe Music\\", which includes recordings of the regimental and battalion's marches as well as other popular tunes, was the only recording publicly released by regimental musicians.Gamble p. 200 ==Casualties== 28 soldiers from 5 UDR died whilst on active duty during the Troubles and a further 12 were assassinated after leaving the regiment.Gamble p. 228 The first to die was Captain Marcus McCausland, a Catholic. McCausland had previously served with the Irish Guards. His family owned a large estate outside Limavady. He had served as high sheriff for the county and was also a member of Limavady urban district council. The Official Irish Republican Army abducted him and interrogated him for four hours before shooting him and dumping his body in the snow.Potter p. 72 The hooded body of Sergeant David C. Deacon, 38, (HQ Company), was found on 3 March 1973 near Derry. His hands were tied behind his back, and he had been tortured. Deacon had previous service in the Royal Navy, was married with four children and was off duty at the time of his abduction and death. Eight years after his death, his wife and four other UDR and RUC widows formed The Widow's Mite to tell the world their side of the story and to counter IRA propaganda. She had her gold wedding melted down and recast as the ancient \\"mite\\" bearing the symbol of a lighted candle.McKitterick p. 337 ==Memorials== A number of memorials exist to the fallen of the 5th Battalion. The main memorial to the UDR was erected in Lisburn, unveiled on 12 June 2011 by Viscount Brookeborough, one of the trustees of the UDR Memorial Trust. The memorial is \\"a 19-foot 'heroic scale' bronze sculpture\\" featuring \\"bronze figures of a male UDR soldier and a female 'Greenfinch' on operational duty...set upon an equally impressive Mourne granite plinth.\\".‚ÄòFitting tribute‚Äô to UDR heroes unveiled.

Around 75% (1,187) of the Tyrone members of the disbanded Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) applied to join 6 UDR, of which 419 were accepted. As a result, the battalion started life as the only battalion more or less up to strength and remained so during its history.Potter 2001, p. 29. The first training major (TISO) was Major GB Hill, MBE, King's Own Borderers, who was based in the Education Building at Lisanelly Barracks, Omagh. Part of his job was to find accommodation for the various companies of the new battalion. Where possible accommodation was sought in British Army bases. The old USC platoon huts were vacant and available, but to have used those would have highlighted the continuity between the USC and the UDR.Potter p27 For a time an old caravan in the centre of Dungannon served as the local UDR post. Ten rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition were stored there.Ryder p42 ==CompaniesC Company and The Deanery=== The Deanery was an 18th-century mansion in Clogher, County Tyrone. It had been the home of Jonathan Swift, the author of Gulliver's TravelsRyder p71 and was one of fifteen old large houses taken over by the Ministry of Defence to house the UDR. After persuading the old lady who lived there to move to less spartan accommodation,Potter p100 ¬£150,000 was spent on the property to turn it into a base for C Company. The house has now been demolished. ==Loss of Catholics== Catholics soon began to leave the regiment in large numbers in response to the British Army's treatment of Catholic civilians, particularly after the implementation of the one-sided Operation Demetrius. ===Intimidation=== Protestant and Catholic soldiers were both intimidated out of the regiment.Potter p58 However, following the introduction of internment, more Catholic soldiers than Protestant found themselves the subject of pressure from within their own community, often amounting to intimidation and violence. In Clady, a soldier who had been in the regiment for only three weeks had his front door daubed with the words \\"Get out of the UDR or be shot - IRA\\". Two weeks later as he, his wife and their five children were asleep, a shotgun was fired at their home, shattering several windows.Ryder p47 ==Casualties== During the general mobilisation for Operation Demetrius a patrol from the battalion came under fire from the Provisional IRA near Clady, County Tyrone. Private Winston Donnell, age 22, one of four brothers serving in the regiment, was killed outright. He was the first UDR soldier to be killed.CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1971, cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 27 October 2015. Sgt Kenneth Smyth Age 28, (B. Company), a former B Special, was killed on 10 December 1971 along with ex Pte Daniel McCormick (a Catholic), who had recently resigned from the Regiment. Sgt Smyth had survived a previous attempt to kill him. Private William Bogle, age 27, (B Company) was killed as he sat in his car with his wife and children on 5 December 1972.

It would have been the third civilian airport serving Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding Greater Klang Valley area in Malaysia, after Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport (Subang Airport). The airport was to be located at Labu, Negeri Sembilan, which is 8.6 kilometres away from KLIA. It was proposed by AirAsia, a Malaysian low-cost airline, to replace its use of the low-cost carrier terminal (LCCT) at KLIA. The airport at Labu was intended to serve AirAsia only, and the other airlines serving Kuala Lumpur, including full service carriers, low-cost carriers as well as cargo airlines would continue to utilize KLIA. By road, the airport is 50 km from downtown Kuala Lumpur, compared to the distance of 78 km for KLIA. The construction of the new airport, on a 2,800ha area at the state's central corridor in Labu, would have been financed by the private sector. The two parties involved in this project were AirAsia Holdings Group and Sime Darby who own the land. Construction was planned to start in mid-2009 and the new airport was anticipated to be ready by 2011. However, after a meeting with the Cabinet Ministers of Malaysia, which includes the Deputy Prime Minister, the government instructed the airport operator of KLIA, Malaysia Airports Holding Berhad, to build a new low-cost carrier terminal at KLIA itself with close consultation with AirAsia. AirAsia will submit its wish-list and specifications to the operator for discussion. The new terminal, klia2, started operations on 2 May 2014, with AirAsia moving to klia2 a week later on 9 May. Currently the former project site is a proposed site for a Royal Malaysian Air Force base. ==Background== Prior to the proposed airport, AirAsia is operating from the LCC terminal of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The terminal was initially build with a design capacity of up to 10 million passenger a year of which further extension to 15 million passenger a year. It was built on a fast track basis starting in June 2005 and opened 6 months later. The site was actually meant for a cargo facility with aprons for aircraft already built. Demand for AirAsia has cause a surge in the usage of LCC terminal which resulted almost 9.5 million passengers in 2007. AirAsia was looking for new room to expand its operations and decided to use a purpose built low-cost carrier airport at a site near the current airport. It was reported on December 2008 that Sime Darby, the land owner for the new airport and AirAsia has given a green light for the building of the new airport in Labu, Negeri Sembilan. It was reported that the cost of building the airport will be totally privately funded by both AirAsia and Sime Darby. The proposal and the speed of the cabinet giving it a green light has attracted many critics, including the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohammed. Arguments against the airport includes duplication of facilities with the new airport and KLIA, questioning the issues on the airport will be privately funded, as some facilities such as access road may need to be borne by the government and also proximity between the two airports. Finally, the criticism has made the cabinet to re-look the issue with the Deputy Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Najib Razak asking AirAsia to present their case to him and other cabinet ministers and the airport operator Malaysia Airports. After the presentation, the cabinet decided that the proposal is off and asked AirAsia to work with the airport operator to build a new LCC Terminal inside KLIA. Although there were talks that the decision on the airport has not been finalized yet, Deputy Prime Minister clarify that the project would not commence as Sime Darby lack funds to initiate infrastructure. He also confirmed that the new LCC terminal will be built within the Kuala Lumpur International Airport. ==Connectivity== The KLIA East @ Labu will be connected with KLIA Main Terminal by:- * A proposed 7 km branch road to link KLIA East @ Labu to KLIA and the North‚ÄìSouth Expressway. * A proposed 7 km ERL link from KLIA to KLIA East. * A bus hub at KLIA East. A 3 km KTM Komuter railway line also has been proposed from the railway station in Labu to KLIA East. All the costs for building the airport, road and rail links will be privately financed. ==Funding== The funding for the building of the airport is reported to be based on private finance initiative (PFI). Funds is expected to be provided by Sime Darby and AirAsia. However, critics questions the validity of the claim as some aspect of the airport operations such as Customs, Immigration and Quarantine facility may need to be borne by the government. The same argument also goes for other infrastructure such as building new KTM or ERL tracks to the airport. ==ControversiesArguments for building the airport=== AirAsia has launch a cyber-campaign to promote the building and use of the airport. The company's chief executive office, Tony Fernandes has dubbed the airport as the Rakyat's Terminal (People's Terminal). On its website AirAsia has listed down several justification on its need to build a new airport for its own purpose. Among them are:- * Passenger capacity - Although the current LCC Terminal in KLIA is currently undergoing construction to enable the terminal to handle 15 million passenger a year, AirAsia expects that the terminal will only hold the passenger growth for only one year. The company anticipates to handle 25 million passenger through the terminal on 2013 which a short fall of over 10 million passengers. There was also concerns that MAHB may not be able to build the new LCC Terminal in KLIA on time to accommodate the expanding fleet of AirAsia aircraft. In addition, there has been complaints the present LCCT is \\"a little more than a shed\\", and concern the new LCCT may not be that much better standard. * Runway capacity - AirAsia claims that KLIA LCC terminal does not have the capacity to cope with peak hour aircraft movements. They are expecting to have 159 Airbus A320 and 25 widebody Airbus A330 by 2013. * Connectivity - AirAsia claims that there are poor connectivity on the terminal * Airport facility - AirAsia claims that waiting time for taxiway has increased due to huge airport layout. They also claimed that the number of gates needed for their operations in the future are insufficient. * Autonomy - AirAsia purports it would not have any say in the new facilities in KLIA and that Malaysia Airports Berhad, the operators of KLIA, intends to build. The airline fears that landing and other charges could rise. It thus announced a plan to build its own airport which it claims will be built on time and to keep expenses low. There has been frustration by AirAsia in the poor performance of the KLIA operators. AirAsia has also list down the justification of choosing the site for the airport. Among them are:- * Location - The new location is cost efficient, good connectivity to highways and railway lines, and a readily available land. The land is owned by Sime Darby. AirAsia also claimed that the land proposed by the airport operator, Malaysia Airports is unsuitable due to Express Rail Link height and power issues. The land is also has poor soil quality making it more expansive and time costing to develop. AirAsia claims that distance between both airport runways exceed international standard of 2 km. * Access - AirAsia claims that the new terminal has seamless connectivy via road and rail. * Passenger Capacity - According to AirAsia, the phase 1 of the airport will able to handle 30 million passenger a year, and phase 2 will able to handle 50 million per year. AirAsia on its website claims that building a second terminal building opposite the current one, as envision in the KLIA master plan was not possible due to Express Rail Link powers cable height issues. According to a local business newspaper, AirAsia enjoys incentives such as waiver of all aeronautical charges except Passenger Service Charge, which is borne by the passenger expires in 2007. The incentive was given as a part of convincing AirAsia to move from Subang Airport to Kuala Lumpur International Airport. However, the incentives covers not only KLIA but all airports where AirAsia operated. Incentive covers waivers on landing, parking, aerobridge and check- in counter charges. It expected that AirAsia wants its own an airport to help better manage airport costs. ===Argument against building the airport=== * The International Air Transport Association (IATA) mentioned that having a single (international) airport is the preferred way to make Kuala Lumpur an aviation hub of choice. It also indicated that by having two (international) airports would mean duplication of services such as fire and rescue, air traffic control, immigration and customs, which in turn would raise the cost of air travel. Finally, the association cited potential problems in managing air traffic as the site of the new airport at Labu is too close to KLIA. * Aseambankers have expressed concern that the proposed new airport could also split Kuala Lumpur as a destination into separate airports, especially when passenger movements currently only total 25 million per annum, which is not huge relatively by world city standards. * The Minority Shareholders Watchdog group (MSWG) has questioned the need for two LCC terminal within 10 km of each other. The group queried whether any cost-benefit analysis had been done on the project, both in financial and non-financial terms. The move of building the second LCC terminal is expected to \\"cannibalized\\" the operator of the main airport as AirAsia commands a significant traffic on KLIA. * This concern has been supported by members of the public who also questioned whether there is really a justification for a third airport for KL, and whether it would be for or against \\"national interest\\". Like the MSWG, there is general concern that the new airport may at least seriously affect the future of KLIA as Malaysia's main gateway to the world. KLIA, it has been argued, is still underutilised for an international airport, and having yet another new international airport serving Kuala Lumpur would significantly dilute the traffic at KLIA. Like IATA, air safety was another concern voiced by other parties as the two airports, KLIA and KLIA-East@Labu are so close and yet they have two separate control towers (although the safety record of AirAsia to date is good). * There is also anxiety that the public, not the private sector, would end up having to foot the expensive bill to build and manage the highway and rail links from KLIA-East@Labu airport to Kuala Lumpur and vicinity. If that is so, some members of the public felt this would be a waste of tax-payer's resources simply for the benefit of the private entity. However, AirAsia has said in the KLIA East website that \\"The government via its letter from the Economic Planning Unit (EPU) to Sime Darby has also made it abundantly clear that all infrastructure costs for this project would be borne by the project developer\\". As for management costs of customs and control tower, etc., AirAsia indicated they need to discuss this further and it could be similar to Senai airport, which is also private. * In \\"The Malaysian Insider\\" news site, the majority of comments from its readers were not in favor of the airport at Labu, and were not convinced by the case put forward by the airline (AirAsia) for the new airport. Even on AirAsia's own KLIA-East micro site which is supposedly biased to strongly promote the airport project, the blog messages for the airport was split with a significant number of bloggers arguing against building the airport. * This issue has apparently split political circles as well as Malaysian society. Even the former Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, who is credited with masterminding the construction of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport waded in against the idea of the new airport at Labu. In his web blog site, he explained that the KLIA Masterplan has been designed to cater for future growth, up to 125 million of passenger annually thus it has the expansion capacity to cater for all the future needs of AirAsia. * Khazanah Nasional, Malaysia, the investment arm of the national government, has opposed the Sime Darby and AirAsia plans. However, critics believe that the agency is not an objective party as it is a major shareholder in Malaysia Airlines and Malaysia Airports Berhad Malaysia Airports Berhad, the airport operator has issues a series of press statements refuting AirAsia claims on airport charges while explaining delays on the construction of a permanent LCC terminal. The airport operator mentioned that:- * AirAsia has been growing out of the Main Terminal Building in Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The operator constructed a separate facility to enable AirAsia to achieve operational efficiency and ultimately, allow the airline to grow. * The current LCC terminal was constructed based on AirAsia requirement and also with a passenger growth projection of 10 million passenger annually by 2012. The terminal was also designed to cater mainly narrow-body aircraft such as the Airbus A320 operated by AirAsia. * Aeronautical charges are not set by the airport operator but by the government of Malaysia. According to the operator, the chargers are already one of the lowest in the region and landing fee has not been increased for 27 years. * The operator has given a waiver for all aeronautical charges excluding Passenger Service Charge to AirAsia from 2002 to 2007 as an incentive to facilitate AirAsia move from Subang Airport to KLIA. AirAsia requested an extension of the incentive benefits, but the operator will give out a different incentive after the approval of airport operator restructuring exercise. On the National Airport Master Plan study, the operator in collaboration with Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Finance, conducted a study on the direction of future development of airports and aviation infrastructure in Malaysia. The issue is complicated by parties (on both sides) which allegedly appear to be interested only for their own benefits. What is more, some of the interested parties are companies partly or wholly owned by the government, or have links with the government. It seems less and less clear where politics come in, where decision is based on pure business, and which decision is truly in the \\"national interest\\". There has also been confusion on decisions from the Cabinet. Although it has approved the project earlier, the latest report from local free newspaper is the Deputy Prime Minister has now said \\"We are studying the matter from all angles to see if the project should go ahead or if we can make some different arrangements.\\". According to Singapore-based Straits Times economists and bankers have said of the debacle, \\"The wrangling (between the various parties) also highlights the (Malaysian) government's inability to rein in poor- performing public enterprises and pursue policies to maximise the use of resources.\\" It also indicated \\"how the dominance of state-controlled agencies often stifles entrepreneurship (in Malaysia)\\". Analysts are calling for the Malaysian administration to referee the case (see External Links below). Air Asia is currently the largest and the most successful budget airline in the whole of Southeast Asia, pioneered by Malaysian entrepreneur Tony Fernandes. He privately bought Air Asia, then an ailing government-linked airline and turned it around as a no-frills budget airline until it was profitable and publicly listed but the public also pointed out that Air Asia receive a lot of benefits like tax waiver incentives, landing rights being fast tracked and also being given lucrative routes that previously serviced by the government-linked Malaysia Airlines. ==References * KLIA2 - New LCC Terminal * KLIA-East microsite * Bernama Report, Jan 9th, 2009 * The Malaysian Insider, Jan 8th, 2009 * Campaign against KLIA East @ Labu * 'Tony Fernandes claims ‚Äúno tax payers\\" money will be used' for KLIA East project, Wee Choo Keong, Jan 14th, 2009 * Straits Times report \\"AirAsia Airport in Limbo\\", Jan 20th, 2009 * KL International Airport‚Äôs new Low Cost Carrier Terminal Category:Proposed airports Category:Proposed transport infrastructure in Malaysia ","title":"KLIA East @ Labu"},{"id":"20179758","text":"Johann Melchior Ernst Sachs (28 February 1843 ‚Äì 18 May 1917) was a German romantic composer, who also held teaching and performing posts.

The ruins of a settlement were discovered in 1992, when Aomori Prefecture started surveying the area for a planned baseball stadium. Archaeologists have used this site to further their understanding of the transition to sedentism and the life of the J≈çmon people. Excavation has led to the discovery of storage pits, above ground storage and long houses. These findings demonstrate a change in the structure of the community, architecture, and organizational behaviors of these people. Because of the extensive information and importance, this site was designated as a Special National Historical Site of Japan in 2000. Today the public can visit the site, its various reconstructions of J≈çmon structures, and a museum that displays and houses artifacts collected on the site, which have collectively been designated an Important Cultural Property ==Early history== Reconstruction of a J≈çmon period longhouse at Sannai-Maruyama. Only a few longhouses were found; they may have been meeting halls or workshops. Elevated storehouse at Sannai-Maruyama. Ento style pottery recovered from Sannai-Maruyama. The word \\"Ento\\" means \\"cylindrical\\". This vessel is a long structure with a wide orifice at the top, and ornamental details. Ento vessels were commonly decorated with cord marks. The Sannai-Maruyama settlement was occupied from the middle of the Early J≈çmon period to the end of the Middle J≈çmon period (3900 ‚Äì 2200 BC), and is the largest the J≈çmon settlement yet discovered in Japan. It is located on a 20 meter high fluvial terrace on the right bank of the Okidate River, at the tip of a ridge extending southwest from the Hakk≈çda Mountains. The area was first settled around 3900 BC. The first settlers of the site lived in pit houses. These dwellings typically were about in diameter. Over 500 pit dwellings have been found on site. Additionally, they stored their food in pits, which allowed them to hide it when they left the site since the occupants were still semi-nomadic. Around 2900 BC, the inhabitants became more sedentary. They began to store food above ground in elevated buildings rather than in pits. Also, longhouses began showing up around this time. Long houses were large, oval-shaped structures. The longest one found at the site was long. Scholars believe longhouses were used for meeting places, workshops, or living space. Pit houses were still being inhabited at the same time that longhouses existed on the landscape. One of Sannai-Maruyama's most famous structures, a reconstruction of a large six-pillared building, was originally built around 2,600 BC. This structure consisted of six large chestnut pillars that are believed to have held a series of platforms. Each one of these pillars was around 1 meter in diameter and was placed exactly apart. Evidence for similar large wooden structures has been found at other sites in Japan and the rest of Eurasia, including a wooden precursor to Stonehenge. Most of the wood structure, like other biological remains at the site, deteriorated due to the acidity of the soil; however, the bottoms of the pillars were preserved because they were waterlogged due to their proximity to a marsh. Due to its large size, it is believed that this structure could have functioned as a monument, watchtower, or a lighthouse overlooking Mutsu Bay (which was larger than at present). Remains of other six-pillared buildings from different time periods have been found throughout the site. Many of the post holes from these buildings overlap each other, which suggests that the structures were being rebuilt in the same location and facing the same direction. The site also contained two middens with domestic refuse, two large mounds, containing refuse, including ceremonial artifacts. A large amount of earthenware and stoneware were recovered from these middens, including approximately 2,000 clay figures, wood products, bones and antler objects and tools, and fragments baskets and lacquerware. Some objects made of jade, amber and obsidian and not native to the area, and could only have come to this site via trade. The site also contained over 500 burial pits for adult remains, and numerous jar- burials for infants. Some burials, hypothesized to be for the social elite, were enclosed within stone circles. The settlement of Sannai-Maruyama ended around 2300 BC due to unknown reasons. Its abandonment was likely due to the population's subsistence economy being unable to result in sustained growth, with its end being spurred on by the reduced amount of natural resources during the neoglaciation. However, during the Heian period, a portion of the site was resettled by new inhabitants who also built pit dwellings, and during the Muromachi period, a portion of the site was occupied by a medieval fortification. ==Modern history== The presence of ruins at Sannai-Maruyama was known even during the Edo period, as travelers through the area commented in finding pottery shards and clay figurines. The first survey was conducted by Keio University and the Aomori City Board of Education from 1953 to 1967 and from 1976 and 1987, the Board of Education of Aomori Prefecture and the city of Aomori conducted further excavations on the southern part of the site. The true significance of the site was not recognized until the start of construction of a prefectural baseball stadium in 1992. Due to the large number of finds during the rescue archaeology conducted at the time, including the foundations for the large six-pillared building in June 1994, Aomori Prefecture cancelled the baseball stadium project and decided to preserve the site in August 1994 as an archaeological park. After this was announced a number of the excavations were backfilled to protect the site. Since 1994, around 26 additional test excavations have been done. These excavations have resulted in around 40% of the site being excavated. In April 2019, the site was consolidated with the nearby museum, the . Administratively, the archaeological site and the museum had been separate entities, but now function as a single historic site. After their merger, entrance fees to the archaeological site and museum began to be collected in the museum building. The Sannai-Maruyama site is the centerpiece of the , a group of J≈çmon period archaeological sites in Hokkaid≈ç and northern T≈çhoku that was recommended by Japan in 2020 for inclusion to the UNESCO World Heritage List, under criteria iii and iv. The submission currently resides on the Tentative List, with the decision to be included in the list to be announced in May 2021. The site will host as the collection point for Aomori Prefecture's Paralympic flame that will be collected from around Japan to be sent to the New National Stadium in Tokyo as part of 2020 Summer Paralympics torch relay. ==Interpretation== The Sannai-Maruyama site was inhabited by hunter-gatherers roughly between 3900 BC2900 BC. Over this period of time, the site changed from a seasonal camp, to the home of a more mobile society, and finally to a settled village. Evidence of this sedentary lifestyle can be found in the form of intense use of natural resources such as nuts, fish, and a wide diversity of plants, as well as changes in storage facilities. Initially, the Sannai-Maruyama site was used on a temporary basis. There were large pits used for storage and can be concealed since they were underground, which was preferred by mobile populations in many parts of the world. A shift occurred around 2900 BC from the use of storage pits to elevated storehouses, revealed by pillar-supported structures that lack the fire pits of the pit-dwellings. An interpretation of this change was that the site's population had become more sedentary. Later in the site's record, evidence of longhouses that were built along with some pit houses were found at the site. The increase in housing also shows a more sedentary lifestyle and an increase in population. Also, the large pillar structure dates to this time period. Construction on this scale implies the existence of a coordinated labor force due to the sheer size of these posts. The placement of the posts would have required the cooperation of several people. Interpretations of the use of this large post-supported platform is that it was a base for a tower, or even a shrine. The impact of neoglaciation on Sannai-Maruyama site's disbandment around 2300 BC has contemporary implications. A decrease in temperature by influenced the collapse of the settlement and civilizations in other parts of the world. The effects of global warming in relation to the effects the ancient cooling had on the site's population reveal the impact such a change in temperature can have on human society. ==See also== * *J≈çmon Archaeological Sites in Hokkaid≈ç, Northern T≈çhoku, and other regions *List of Historic Sites of Japan (Aomori) *List of Special Places of Scenic Beauty, Special Historic Sites and Special Natural Monuments ==References * *Official website *Official website * \\"Sannai Maruyama.\\" Jomon Archaeological Sites.

It makes use of the Summit (puzzle) scoring system which awards higher scores for long answers containing letters towards the end of the alphabet. Showdown is one of the first boxed games to integrate mobile telephone and text message technology, as players can text their answers to a Showdown number which calculates the value of their answers and replies within 10 seconds with their score. The game was created by Winning Moves in 2008. A mobile version of the game was launched in Ireland in 2002 by national broadcaster RT√â and Zamano. Showdown has been described as \\"Trivial Pursuit meets Scrabble\\" by Peter Sterling, Puzzles Editor for the Press Association. == How To Play == Play begins when one player draws a Topic Card from the deck, and reads out the five topics on it. They range from general knowledge topics (a European country) to popular culture (a James Bond character) to the everyday (something found in a bathroom). Players have two minutes to come up with an answer to each of the five topics, keeping in mind that if they come up with the same answer as another player, both will score 0 points. They also bear in mind the Summit scoring system, in which each letter A is worth 1 point, B is worth 2, C worth 3, up to Z which is worth 26. Other characters such as punctuation and spaces are ignored. For example, the band ABBA scores 6 points whereas ZZ Top scores 103. Image:Summit scoring.svg When the time is up, players with a valid answer for a topic can choose whether to go ‚Äúin‚Äù or ‚Äúout‚Äù depending on whether they feel they have a high-scoring, unique answer or not. If a player chooses ‚Äúout‚Äù, they bank 5 points. Once everyone has announced ‚Äúin‚Äù or ‚Äúout‚Äù, everyone's answers are revealed. If one or more players have chosen ‚Äúin‚Äù and have the same answer, they are knocked out and score 0. If a player has chosen ‚Äúin‚Äù and has a unique answer, they can bank 10 points. Now that everyone knows the other players‚Äô answers, players must decide whether to enter The Showdown to try to win the maximum 20 points for that topic. The Showdown is where the Summit scoring system comes into play; the highest scoring word in The Showdown wins, and anyone losing The Showdown scores 0. Players announce ‚Äúin‚Äù or ‚Äúout‚Äù again, with players going ‚Äúout‚Äù at this stage scoring 10 points. If two or more players go ‚Äúin‚Äù to The Showdown, the scores are calculated and the highest-scoring answer wins 20 points. If only one player is willing to enter The Showdown (for example, if everyone thinks that one player's answer is clearly much better than all the others) then that person automatically wins the 20 points. If two or more players have an equal Summit score (for example, the musicals My Fair Lady and Calamity Jane both score 114), then both players win 20 points for that topic. The player with the most points after the 5 topics wins the game. == Strategy == There are several strategies that can be used to win Showdown. === Unique answers === It is possible to win the game without ever entering The Showdown itself, simply by coming up with unique answers and banking 10 points for each topic. For example, if the topic is Football Clubs, a player might choose Leeds United (118) over answers such as Wycombe Wanderers (193) or Wolverhampton Wanderers (289), in the knowledge that whilst Leeds United scores less, other players are unlikely to choose it for exactly that reason and therefore it is probable that it will be a unique answer. === Bluff === Players can attempt to deceive their opponents by bluffing. This can either be in feigning confidence in the score of their answer before the actual score has been calculated, in an attempt to scare other players out of the game, or in feigning a lack of confidence in an attempt to suck other players into a Showdown and defeat them that way. === Risk taking === As players are generally likely to choose a unique answer, players willing to take a risk can attempt a double bluff and choose an extremely obvious answer in the chance that other players have avoided it for that reason. For example, if the topic is Countries of the World, United States of America is an obviously high- scoring answer (228) because of its length and the number of high-scoring Ss and Ts. But because it is so obvious, players may avoid it because it is unlikely to be unique. This affords a brave player the opportunity to take a risk on both a unique and high-scoring answer. == Gameplay variation == Showdown can also be played where players are attempting to get a low-scoring answer rather than a high-scoring one. For example, in this variation, a Hot Drink topic would see Tea (26) beating Coffee (40). == Online Textulator == The Showdown website allows visitors to type in any answer and instantly calculate their scores, which can be used both while playing the game and to allow fans to compare the scores of anything from the names of their family members to the names of football players to try to find out what has the highest value.

Darwin has interested us in the history of Nature's Technology, i.e., in the formation of the organs of plants and animals, which organs serve as instruments of production for sustaining life. Does not the history of the productive organs of man, of organs that are the material basis of all social organisation, deserve equal attention? And would not such a history be easier to compile, since, as Vico says, human history differs from natural history in this, that we have made the former, but not the latter? Technology discloses man's mode of dealing with Nature, the process of production by which, he sustains his life, and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations, and of the mental conceptions that flow from them.‚Äù (MECW Vol 35.375)Marx, Karl & Engels, Frederick Collected Works Volume 35.

He is a two-time Dutch Chess Champion. ==Competitive beginnings== Taught by his father at the age of six, he quickly progressed to being a regular on the youth tournament circuit, both nationally and internationally. While he found medals hard to come by at world and European level, he was practically unstoppable in domestic competition, taking gold medals in a number of age categories: Under-14 champion in 1998, Under-16 champion in 2000 and Under-20 champion in 2002 (the latter being shared with Erwin l'Ami). His best performance at the World Junior Chess Championship occurred in 2005, when he took fifth place. ==Lifestyle and chess style== Smeets, who hails from the Oegstgeest suburb of Leiden, tried for a year to become a full-time chess professional. However, along with friend and fellow grandmaster Jan Werle, he found that the lifestyle was not to his liking. Relentless study at the chessboard can be a lonely existence and he considered the ‚Äòdead times‚Äô between chess events to be lacking any element of fun. Consequently, he became a student of Economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam and included only as much chess study as his schedule allowed. He finds it difficult to define his chess style, but reflecting on past performances, recalls relying too heavily on tricks and playing aggressively. While this may have cost him a few first places, he describes his lack of nerves as a real asset, helping him gain many extra points and half points at the critical stages of matches and tournaments. ==Playing record== GM Jan Smeets 2004 was the year that his participation in senior tournaments began to yield encouraging results. He finished in second place in Gouda (after Daniel Fridman) and gained the Grandmaster title the same year. At Dos Hermanas the following year, he shared third behind Fridman and Bu Xiangzhi (with Sergey Volkov) and at the 2005 Hengelo Stork Young Masters event, he finished one-half point behind the Russian grandmaster Alexander Riazantsev. This was a year of significant breakthrough for Smeets, when he recorded one of his best performances at Wijk aan Zee's Corus 'B' tournament, finishing equal with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov for a share of second place, behind Teimour Radjabov. Left in his wake were a multitude of other strong players, including Peter Heine Nielsen, Ivan Cheparinov, Alexander Onischuk, Magnus Carlsen and Predrag Nikoliƒá. He played successfully at the Essent Open in Hoogeveen in 2007, finishing once more as runner-up, this time with Friso Nijboer, Jan Werle and Evgeny Postny, behind surprise winner Eltaj Safarli. In 2008, there were a number of excellent results; he was the winner of the Dutch Championship at Hilversum and finished third at the Howard Staunton Memorial Tournament, after Michael Adams and Loek van Wely, but ahead of Jan Timman, Ivan Sokolov and Nigel Short. He took a share of fifth place at the EU Individual Open Chess Championship, was selected to represent the Netherlands at the Dresden Olympiad and shared second place in the four player Essent (Crown Group) Tournament, after Ivan Sokolov and equal with former World Junior Champion Ahmed Adly. It was also a year in which his Elo rating broke through the 2600 barrier. In 2010 Smeets won the Dutch Championship for the second time. Smeets is a very keen player of team chess and competes in the national leagues of Germany (for Bundesliga team Solingen SG 1868), Belgium and the Netherlands (where he drew with former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik). == Notable games == * Mamedyarov vs Smeets, Wijk aan Zee, Corus 'B', 2005, Caro-Kann, 0-1 * Smeets vs Short, London, Staunton Memorial, 2008, Closed Spanish, 1-0 == References == * 2007 Corus biography * 2005 Corus 'B' final standings * 'Wild Knights' article/interview * Essent 2007 result * Essent 2008 result * Dos Hermanas 2005 result == External links == * * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Chess grandmasters Category:Dutch chess players Category:People from Oegstgeest ","title":"Jan Smeets"},{"id":"20180466","text":"No. 221 Squadron was a Royal Air Force squadron that saw service in both the First and Second World Wars.

The M139 bomblet was a U.S. sub- munition designed for use in warheads as a chemical cluster munition. Each spherical bomblet held of sarin nerve agent. ==History== A spherical chemical cluster munition, the M134, had been developed for the Honest John rocket but not deployed, owing to a variety of problems. In 1964, a new warhead size was standardized for the smaller, diameter, Little John rocket. The warhead held 52 M139 bomblets. When the MGM-29 Sergeant was deployed in the 1960s, it had the capacity to deliver a warhead carrying 330 M139 bomblets. Subsequent missile systems, including the Pershing missile, had the capability to carry warheads with the M139 inside.Smart, Jeffery K. Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare : Chapter 2 - History of Chemical and Biological Warfare: An American Perspective, (PDF: p. 59), Borden Institute, Textbooks of Military Medicine, PDF via Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base, accessed November 12, 2008. In total, about 60,000 M139s were produced and stored; almost all were destroyed between April and November 1976. ==Specifications== The M139 was a spherical bomblet that was filled with of sarin (GB). On the outside of the device were \\"vanes\\"; the vanes created a spin which armed the impact fuze. This \\"spin-to-arm\\" type fuze required between 1,000 and 2,000 rotations per minute to arm, which made handling the bomblets simpler because they were insensitive to normal movements.Mauroni, Albert J. Chemical Demilitarization: Public Policy Aspects, (Google Books), Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, p. 20, (). The bomblet's interior contained a central explosive burster charge, containing of composition B, and two outer compartments which contained the sarin. ==Tests involving the M139== The M139 bomblet was used by the U.S. Army in at least two instances of chemical weapons testing. In 1967 there were two series of tests which sought to learn the effects of Sarin dropped in the bomblets over two different types of forest environment. The first series of tests, known as Green Mist, took place March 25-April 24, 1967. Conducted in Hawaii, the purpose of the tests was to ascertain the effect of Sarin-filled M139s being dropped and disseminated over a canopy rain forest. The Hawaii tests used both sarin nerve agent and the simulant methylacetoacetate.\\"Fact Sheet -- Green Mist\\", The official website of the Military Health System and the Defense Health Agency, accessed September 22, 2016. Another test using the M139 took place at the Gerstle River test site, near Fort Greely, Alaska, from June to July 1967. The purpose of these tests was to determine the effectiveness of Sarin-filled M139 and BLU-19/B23 bomblets when dropped from a SADEYE dispenser in a summer forest environment. The tests were collectively known as \\"Dew Point\\". Both 1967 testing operations were overseen by the U.S. Army's Deseret Test Center.\\"Fact Sheet -- Dew Point\\", The official website of the Military Health System and the Defense Health Agency, accessed September 22, 2016.

It was bought by G.J. Churchward to evaluate French locomotive practice, and particularly the effect of compounding. ==History== George Jackson Churchward, on succeeding William Dean as Chief Mechanical Engineer of the Great Western Railway (GWR), planned the introduction of a series of locomotives designed to tackle the South Devon Banks. Churchward looked at the best practice from both Europe and America, and was impressed by the performance of the de Glehn compounds running on the Nord railway in France. A single locomotive, built specifically for the GWR by Soci√©t√© Alsacienne de Constructions M√©caniques on the de Glehn principles was delivered in October 1903. This locomotive was numbered 102 and named La France although the makers plates had to be moved from the cabside to the front splasher to allow the number to be fitted in the usual GWR position. ==Description== La France was visibly not a GWR engine, although fitted with a Swindon chimney and paired with a standard tender, as immediately recognisable from firebox and the cab. Initially the locomotive was painted black, looking more LNWR than GWR, but it was repainted in 1905 into the standard GWR green livery. La France had two low pressure cylinders fitted between the frames, and two high pressure cylinders outside. The low pressure cylinders drove the front driving wheels while the high pressure cylinders drove the rear driving wheels. Also notable was the external steam pipe mounted just in front of the dome, and looking rather similar in appearance to a top feed. ==Operation== La France was put to work on important expresses in order to fully evaluate it in operation, and worked turn and turn about with GWR 4-4-0 express locos such as the City class and Atbara class. No.102 hauled the inaugural down Cornish Riviera Express from Paddington on 1 July 1904, this becoming a regular turn which required a non-stop run to Plymouth. In 1913 a top feed and new steam pipes were fitted, and then in 1916 the boiler was replaced by a GWR standard No.1 boiler. In 1926, along with two other French locomotives 103 President and 104 Alliance, 102 was based at Oxford shed. La France was withdrawn in October 1926 having achieved 728,031 miles. In practice, La France did not provide any significant improvement in either performance or economy compared to No 171 Albion, Churchwards prototype 4-6-0 which was converted to a 4-4-2 specifically for comparison with the French locomotive. Some other benefits were found, however, particularly a much smoother ride and also a reduction in the loads on the rods and axleboxes due to the drive being split between the two driving axles. Despite being remembered for not changing Churchward's views about using a 4-6-0 wheel arrangement for his locomotives, and failing to demonstrate the claimed significant benefits of compounding, La France did leave a lasting legacy on British steam locomotive design. Churchward adopted the de Glehn bogie design for his locomotives, and its success endured with its use by William Stanier on the LMS and subsequently by Robert Riddles on the BR standard designs. It also found its way onto Southern Railway locomotives. == References == 0102 La France Category:4-4-2 locomotives Category:Compound locomotives Category:Scrapped locomotives Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1903 Category:SACM locomotives Category:De Glehn compound locomotives Category:2‚Ä≤B1 n4v locomotives ","title":"GWR 102 La France"},{"id":"20180730","text":"Vera is an unincorporated community in Sharon Township, Fayette County, Illinois, United States. ==History== Vera originally was called Bear Creek.

The Jarosekas Quartet was initially formed in May 1940 as an offshoot of the Kaunas University men's choir. The 2 initiating members were Liudas Jaro≈°ekas and V. Baranauskas. Also part of the initial group were J. P. Nasvytis, J. Deltuva and A. Matukonis. Shortly thereafter V. Baranauskas left the group, most likely due to conflicts between the two leaders. This was soon followed by a rapid change of the group's composition until Liudas Jaro≈°ekas, Vytautas ≈Ωmuidzinas, Algirdas Matukonis, Aleksas Paulionis and Jurgis Dauknys stabilized the group's foundation. The first public performance took place in September 1940 in a Kaunas high school. Until August 1941 the group mainly gave concerts together with the men's choir of Kaunas University. From September 1941 up through the Soviet invasion of Lithuania in May 1944 the group gave nearly weekly live radio concerts through the main Lithuanian radio station, based in the then capital of Lithuania, Kaunas. The group was most often accompanied by their koncertmeister Jurgis Dauknys, and they were also accompanied by the Radiofonas radio orchestra, directed by J. Lechaviƒçius. Sometimes they had guest performers at their concerts from the Lithuanian National Theater, which included soloists - A. Kuƒçingis, J. Ma≈æeika, V. Jonu≈°kaitƒó-Zaunienƒó. At times they were joined by the very popular crooner Antanas ≈†abaniauskas and akordeonist ƒåetkauskas. In concerts, which took place in large halls, they were sometimes joined by the popular humorist, actor and director Stasys ƒåaikauskas to give the audience a pause between songs. The group was extremely popular from their start and continued their success in Lithuania until the Soviet invasion of Lithuania towards the end of World War II. With the pending arrival of the Soviet army, Liudas Jaro≈°ekas and most of the group fled to Germany where they quickly regrouped and continued their great success until 1949. While in Germany they not only gave concerts to the Lithiuanian expat communities in Western Europe, but also concerts for general audiences in such places as the Dresden State Theater. With part of the group again reforming in the early 1950s in Chicago, they continued to give limited concerts in the United States and Canada well into the 1960s. In the early part of their career, the songs performed were mainly in the style of popular western music of the times. As time passed, half the program was Lithuanian folk songs and patriotic songs. In their final days in Lithuania prior to the end of World War II, in their larger concerts, more complex and highly arranged songs and a few arias from operas, were included. In their period in Lithuania from 1940 - 1944 their repertoire included over 40 different songs.Mano Senasis Radijas - Eugenija Nijola Jankutƒó - 2006, ==Main members of the group== Liudas Jaro≈°ekas - Founder and second tenor Vytautas ≈Ωmuidzinas - Lead tenor Algirdas Matukonis - Baritone Aleksas Paulionis - Bass Jurgis Dauknys - Accompanist ==References== Category:Lithuanian male singers Category:Lithuanian pop music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1940 Category:1940 establishments in Lithuania Category:Vytautas Magnus University ","title":"Jarosekas Quartet"},{"id":"20180776","text":"Outback 8 is a TV show that was broadcast on Network Tenhttp://www.ten.com.au/outback8 in Australia and BBC in the UK in 2008.

Note the incomplete station building (no roof) behind the loco RM55 and trailer pause at Pittsworth Station on a special train to Millmerran to Celebrate the Centenary of the opening of the line to Pittsworth, September 1987 The Queensland Parliament approved a railway line to link Pittsworth with the east via the Southern railway line from Toowoomba in October 1885. The line branches off the Southern line in the township of Wyreema (then called Beauaraba) 17 km south of the major regional city of Toowoomba and opened on 19 September 1887. The Southern line branched from Gowrie Junction until the opening of the Drayton Deviation from Toowoomba direct to Wyreema in 1915. Stops were constructed en route to Pittsworth at The Hollows, Umbiram, Southbrook, Green Hills and Broxburn. An extension to the agricultural centre of Millmerran via Murlaggan, Yarranlea, Cecilvale, Brookstead, Pampas and Yandilla was approved in November 1909 and opened for business on 18 October 1911. Much of the line closely parallels the Gore Highway. Grain traffic was substantial and has been the branch lifeblood all along. A rail motor service operated between 1928 and 1969. As occurred elsewhere, road transport took over much of the business with the result that only spasmodic grain transport remains. The line was closed following the 2010‚Äì11 Queensland floods. ==Current line standards== The line is laid with 30kg/m rail with an axle load of 15.75 tonnes. The maximum grade is 1 in 50 (2%) and the minimum radius curves are 160m. The line speed is 50km/h to Brookstead, and 30km/h beyond. ==See also== * Rail transport in Queensland ==References== * \\" ==External links== * 1925 map of the Queensland railway system Category:Railway lines in Queensland Category:Railway lines opened in 1897 Category:Toowoomba Region Category:1897 establishments in Australia ","title":"Millmerran railway line"},{"id":"20180854","text":"Saint James is an unincorporated community in Wheatland Township, Fayette County, Illinois, United States. ==Geography== Saint James is located at at an elevation of 604 feet. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in Fayette County, Illinois Category:Unincorporated communities in Illinois ","title":"Saint James, Illinois"},{"id":"20180912","text":"Love Hurts is the fifth solo album by English singer Elaine Paige, released in 1985, on the Warner Music label.

The onus is squarely on the writer to determine how much profanity to use, to enquire as to each publisher's limits, and to think about the effect that the use of profanity will have on the reader, both in perceiving the characters and in possibly being offended by the story as a whole. Card urges those writers who do decide to omit profanity from their stories to omit it completely. He regards the coinage of tanj (\\"There Ain't No Justice\\") by Larry Niven as a \\"noble experiment\\" that \\"proved that euphemisms are often worse than the crudities that they replace\\", because they make the story look silly. In Card's opinion, such nonce words simply do not work. Ruth Wajnryb shares this opinion, stating that tanj or flarn do not work as profanities because they are not real, and are \\"just a futile attempt to give clean-cut stories some foul-mouthed action\\". Jes Battis observes, in contrast, that the use of frell and dren in Farscape allowed the television series to get away with dialogue that would normally never have made it past broadcasting and network censorship. The words are respectively equivalent to fuck and shit and are used as both interjections and nouns in the series. In the episode \\"Suns and Lovers\\", for example, Aeryn Sun says \\"frell me dead!\\" as an exclamation of surprise, much as a real-world person would utter \\"well, fuck me!\\" or, indeed, \\"fuck me dead!\\" Battis also notes that Firefly used a similar strategy, by using Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese for all profanities, also using the word gorram as a replacement for god damn, a phrase usually considered blasphemous. Likewise, dialogue in Battlestar Galactica is liberally peppered with the word frak ('fuck'). Similarly, invented expletives are used throughout the Star Wars expanded universe. For example, the Alderaanian expletive stang was introduced in the 1978 novel Splinter of the Mind's Eye and subsequently used in Star Wars novels, comic books, and games. Also, Star Wars authors commonly use the Huttese curse fierfek, first introduced in a short story published in the 1996 anthology Tales from Jabba's Palace, and the Corelian curse sithspawn, first introduced in the 1994/1995 comic book series Dark Empire II. Parke Godwin opines that excessive profanity, as a part of naturalistic dialogue, \\"dulls much modern fiction and too many films\\" and states it to be a pitfall for novice writers, or for writers who never grow up, to fall into. He states that it is a \\"lazy copout that no longer frightens horses in the street, merely annoys and ultimately bores an intelligent reader\\". He advises writers that \\"less is more\\", and that if it really is the right thing for a character to be \\"salty\\", it should be made clear to the reader why, observing as an example that in his science fiction novel Limbo Search the profanity used by character Janice Tyne is a symptom of her fear and tension, caused by being burned out at age 27 and afraid of the future. Wanda Raiford observes that the use of the nonce word frak in both Battlestar Galactica series is \\"an indispensable part of the naturalistic tone that show strives to achieve\\", noting that it, and toaster (a racial epithet for Cylons), allow the show to use obscene and racialist dialogue that no real-life educated American adult would consider using the real-life equivalents of in polite company. She compares the racial hatred associated with the use of nigger (an utterance of which she states to have preceded and accompanied \\"every lynching of a black person in America\\") to the racial hatred of the Cylons, by the humans, that the use of such phrases as frakking toasters indicates in the series. She also observes that several of the characters, including Gaius Baltar, are frakking toaster lovers. In the series of Star Trek: New Frontier novels by Peter David, the principal protagonist, Captain Mackenzie Calhoun, frequently utters the word grozit, a curse from his home world of Xenex. It is understood to be the equivalent to shit. The 2005 video game Star Wars: Republic Commando also used fierfek, the expletive popular in the Star Wars franchise. This word is described in-universe as being an alien loan-word originally meaning 'poison', but has been adopted by the game's special forces protagonists as a curse word to make the illusion of playing as commandos more believable. ==Fictional profanities== Profanity in SF also encompasses the idea of things that alien cultures might find profane, and the notion that what non-humans and humans find to be profane may differ markedly. Card observes that human profanity encompasses words dealing with sexual intercourse and states that that tells one something about human beings. He proceeds to suggest that what aliens might find to be profane can be a useful tool for suggesting the alienness of a culture. The first example of this that he gives are alien cultures that have no trouble with words about sexual intercourse, but that find words to do with eating to be profane. Star Trek: Enterprise made use of this concept in the episode \\"Vox Sola\\".Ex Astris Scientia, Enterprise Episodes, Season 2 The second example Card provides is that of alien cultures where the idea of property ownership is considered to be as obscene as pederasty. Douglas Adams's The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy at one point mentions that the word Belgium is the worst profanity in the galaxy. ==In other contexts== As mentioned above, shazbot briefly enjoyed popular usage outside of its television show. Battlestar Galacticas frak, a word that Lee Goldberg characterizes as \\"something truly amazing and subversive\\" and that Scott Adams calls \\"pure genius\\", has also escaped its original context. Originally spelled frack, it along with felgercarb were coined by writer Glen A. Larson for the 1978 Battlestar Galactica, for much the same reasons that frell and dren were coined for Farscape: the ability to use profane dialogue, with words that would be immediately understood as synonymous with the real profanities that they stood in for, without falling foul of network censorship and broadcasting restrictions accompanying its original Sunday evening broadcast timeslot. The producers re-spelled the word frak for the 2004 Battlestar Galactica series, in order to make it, literally, a four-letter word; the word appears in several Black Library novels before then, most notably the Ciaphas Cain series. It has escaped, in both forms, from the series to a whole variety of other contexts, from a Dilbert cartoon strip where Dilbert mutters it, through other television shows including The Office, Gossip Girl, Veronica Mars, 30 Rock, and Scrubs, and Robert Crais' Elvis Cole novel Chasing Darkness, to everyday spoken use. The BBC Two science fiction television series Red Dwarf replaces most of its characters' profanities with invented terms, mainly smeg (possibly a truncation of smegma) and its compound smeg-head. Other common insults are goit and gimboid. == Footnotes == * Battis has lot to say on Aeryn Sun's use of \\"frell\\" here, in terms of its status as a non-performative utterance, and the locutionary and perlocutionary power of the statement. For more detail, see pages 146 et seq. of Battis 2007. == References  See also == * Minced oaths in literature Category:Profanity Category:Euphemisms Category:Self-censorship Category:Topics in science fiction ","title":"Profanity in science fiction"},{"id":"20180933","text":"Jim S√©vellecNickname he was given by Scottish or American troops during the First World War, as easier to pronounce than Eug√®ne - He generally signed himself Jim E.

In June 1940, the Soviet Union issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Romania, demanding the ceding of Northern Bukovina, a region with a large ethnic Ukrainian population.

The Soviet Union would later deny the existence of this secret protocol, claiming that it was never allied with the German Reich, and acted independently to protect the Ukrainian and White Ruthenian (modern Belarusian) minorities in the disintegrating Polish state.Anna M.

Composed of mostly ethnic Ukrainian Soviet troops under the command of Marshal Semyon Timoshenko, the Soviet forces occupied the eastern areas of Poland within 12 days, capturing the regions of Galicia and Volhynia with little Polish opposition, and occupying the principal city, Lw√≥w, by September 22. According to Volodymyr Kubiyovych, Soviet troops were greeted with genuine joy by the Ukrainian villagers due to the Polish government's discrimination against the Ukrainian minority in previous years.

Immediately after entering Poland's territory, the Soviet army helped to set up \\"provisional administrations\\" in the cities and \\"peasant committees\\" in the villages in order to organize one-list elections to the new \\"People's Assembly of Western Ukraine\\". The elections were designed to give the annexation an appearance of validity, but were far from free or fair. The voters had a choice of only one candidate, often a local communist or someone sent to western Ukraine from Soviet Ukraine Paul Robert Magocsi. (1983). Galicia: A historical Survey and Bibliographic Guide. Toronto: University of Toronto Press pg. 207 for each position of deputy; the communist party commissars then provided the assembly with resolutions that would push through nationalization of banks and heavy industry and transfers of land to peasant communities., pp. 29‚Äì30. Elections took place on October 22, 1939; the official numbers reported participation of 93 percent of the electorate, 91 percent of whom supported the appointed candidates. Based on these results, the People's Assembly of Western Ukraine, headed by Kyryl Studynsky (a prominent academic and figure in the Christian Social Movement), consisted of 1,484 deputies. They met in Lw√≥w on October 26‚Äì28, where they were addressed by Nikita Khrushchev and other representatives of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. The assembly voted unanimously to thank Stalin for liberation and sent a delegation headed by Studynsky to Moscow to ask for formal inclusion of the territories into the Ukrainian SSR. The Supreme Soviet voted to do so on November 1, 1939 and on November 15 a law was passed making the former eastern Polish territories a part of the Ukrainian SSR. ==Annexation of Romanian territory== On June 26, 1940, Soviet People's Commissar Vyacheslav Molotov presented an ultimatum note to Gheorghe Davidescu, Romanian ambassador to Moscow, in which the Soviet Union demanded the evacuation of the Romanian military and administration from Bessarabia and from the northern part of Bukovina within 24 hours.Research Divi Federal Research Division, Federal Research Division, Romania a Country Study: A Country Study, Kessinger Publishing, 2004 , Google Print, p.79–£–ª—å—Ç–∏–º–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–∞—è –Ω–æ—Ç–∞ —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞ —Ä—É–º—ã–Ω—Å–∫–æ–º—É –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤—É 26 –∏—é–Ω—è 1940 –≥.

Northern Bukovina has had some historical connections with Galicia, which was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1939, in the sense that both were part of Austria-Hungary from the second part of the 18th century until 1918. Also, unlike Bessarabia and Hertza, Northern Bukovina had a Ukrainian majority.* Romania agreed to withdraw from the territories, to avoid a full- scale military conflict. The occupied territories were turned into the Moldavian SSR, a constituent republic of the USSR, and Chernivtsi and Izmail Oblasts in the Ukrainian SSR. ==Soviet policies in the annexed territories== eastern Poland. Soldier knocking off caricature of a Polish general from the backs of peasants armed with boulders ===Government and administration=== The lands annexed by the Soviet Union were administratively reorganized into six oblasts similar to those in the rest of the Soviet Union (Drohobych Oblast, Lviv Oblast, Rivne Oblast, Stanislav (later known as Ivano-Frankivsk) Oblast, Tarnopil Oblast and Volyn Oblast). The civilian administration in those regions annexed from Poland was organized by December 1939 and was drawn mostly from newcomers from eastern Ukraine and Russia; only 20% of government employees were from the local population. It was falsely assumed by many Ukrainians that a disproportionate number of people working for the Soviet administration came from within the Jewish community. The reason for this belief was that most of the previous Polish administrators were deported, and the local Ukrainian intelligentsia who could have taken their place were generally deemed to be too nationalistic for such work by the Soviets. In reality, most positions were staffed by ethnic Ukrainians from the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, in the eyes of many Ukrainians the Jews came to be associated with Soviet rule, which contributed to rising anti-Jewish sentiments.Ukrainian Collaboration in the Extermination of the Jews during the Second World War: Sorting Out the Long-Term and Conjunctural Factors by John- Paul Himka, University of Alberta. Taken from The Fate of the European Jews, 1939‚Äì1945: Continuity or Contingency, ed. Jonathan Frankel (New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), Studies in Contemporary Jewry 13 (1997): 170‚Äì189. The Polish language was eliminated from public life, and Ukrainian became the language of the government and the courts. All Polish institutions were abolished, and all Polish officials, civil servants, and police were deported to Siberia or Central Asia.Paul Robert Magocsi. (1996). A History of Ukraine. Toronto: University of Toronto Press Ukrainian organizations not controlled by the Soviets were limited or abolished. Hundreds of credit unions and cooperatives that had served the Ukrainian people between the wars were shut down. All local Ukrainian political parties were abolished, and between 20,000 and 30,000 Ukrainian activists, fled to German-occupied territory; most of those who did not escape were arrested. For example, Dr. Dmytro Levitsky, former head of the moderate Ukrainian political party Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance (UNDO) that had dominated Ukrainian political life between the world wars, and chief of the Ukrainian delegation in the pre-war Polish parliament, was arrested alongside many of his colleagues, deported to Moscow, and never heard from again.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pg. 65 The elimination of the individuals, organizations and parties that represented moderate or liberal political tendencies left the extremist Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, which operated in the underground, as the only political party with a significant organizational presence left in western Ukraine. ===Education and healthcare=== Pro-Soviet caricatures published in Polish language in Lviv in September 1940, ridiculing \\"enemies of the state\\" ‚Äì Polish businessmen, army officers and aristocracy. Due to the sensitive location of western Ukraine along the border with German-held territory, the Soviet administration made attempts, initially, to gain the loyalty and respect of the Ukrainian population. Healthcare, especially in the villages, was improved dramatically. Between the two world wars Poland had drastically reduced the number of Ukrainian-language schools while Romania had eliminated them completely. These were now reopened and, although the Russian language became a mandatory foreign-language course, the schools were taught in Ukrainian. Ukrainian was reintroduced in the University of Lviv (where the Polish government had banished it during the interwar years), which became thoroughly Ukrainized and renamed after Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko. The Soviet authorities established a branch of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences in Lviv, and some leading non-Communist Ukrainian scholars were invited to staff these institutions. University students from Eastern Ukraine were brought to Lviv and western Ukrainian students, professors, and other cultural figures were sent on Soviet-funded trips to Kiev. An unintended result of such exchanges was that the Galician youth were disagreeably surprised by the material poverty and widespread use of the Russian language in Soviet Ukraine, while the incoming students to western Ukraine became exposed to and sometimes came to adopt western Ukrainian nationalism.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 63‚Äì72 In contrast to the dramatic expansion of educational opportunities within the Soviet system, non- Soviet controlled educational institutions such as the popular Prosvita society reading rooms, the Shevchenko Scientific Society, libraries and community theaters, and the Russophile Stauropegion Institute were closed or abolished. ===Land reform=== In the annexed territories, over 50 percent of the land had belonged to Polish or Romanian landlords while approximately 75% of the Ukrainian peasants owned less than two hectares of land per household. Starting in 1939 lands not owned by the peasants were seized and slightly less than half of them were distributed to landless peasants free of charge; the rest were given to new collective farms. The Soviet authorities then began taking land from the peasants themselves and turning it over to collective farms, which affected 13% of western Ukrainian farmland by 1941. This caused the peasants to turn against the Soviet regime. ===Religious persecution=== Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky, head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church At the time of the Soviet annexation of western Ukraine the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church had approximately 2,190 parishes, three theological seminaries, 29 monasteries, 120 convents and 3.5 million faithful.Bohdan Bociurkiw. (1989). Sheptytskyi and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church Under the Soviet Occupation of 1939‚Äì1941, pp. 101‚Äì123. Taken from Morality and Reality: The Life and Times of Andrei Sheptytskyi, edited by Paul Robert Magocsi. Edmonton Canada: Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta. Its leader, Andrey Sheptytsky, was seen as a \\"father figure\\" by most Western Ukrainians. The married Western Ukrainian Clergy and their children formed a caste that had a high degree of influence within Ukrainian society.Orest Subtelny. (1988). Ukraine: A History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.214‚Äì219. Using his moral influence, Sheptytsky persuaded all but approximately 100 of the Ukrainian Catholic priests in western Ukrainian to stay with their flock in western Ukraine rather than flee from the Soviet regime. Due to its immense popularity, as well as that of Sheptytsky, among the western Ukrainian people, the Soviet Union did not attempt to abolish the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church nor persecute its leader at that time. Instead, it sought to limit the Church's influence by banishing its presence from schools, preventing it from printing (20 Ukrainian Catholic journals or newspapers were shut down), confiscating lands from which it derived income, closing monasteries and seminaries, levying high taxes, and introducing anti- religious propaganda into schools and the media. The Soviets also attempted to undermine the Church from within. A prominent Lviv priest and close confidante of Andrey Sheptytsky, Havriil Kostelnyk, who had been the principal critic of the Vatican's Latinization policies and spokesperson for the \\"Easternizing\\" trend within the Ukrainian Catholic Church, was asked to organize a \\"National\\" Greek Catholic Church, with Soviet support, that would be independent of the Vatican and which would split the faithful in western Ukraine. At this time, he refused to cooperate, even after the autumn of 1940 when the Soviets arrested his youngest son in order to blackmail him. (After Sheptytksy's death, however, Kostelnyk would play a significant role in the destruction of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church). Arrests, though not of a mass nature, were used in order to terrify the religious leaders. For example, in June 1940 the superior of the Studite convent in Lviv, Olena Viter, was imprisoned and tortured in order to \\"confess\\" that Sheptytsky was a member of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and that she was supplying him with weapons. She refused to do so. By the summer of 1941, in Western Ukraine 11 or 12 Greek Catholic priests were murdered or missing, and fifty-three were imprisoned or deported. Despite the various restrictions, the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was left as the only remaining independent Ukrainian institution that operated openly in Ukrainian territory. Church attendance soared, and contemporary accounts described churches never having been as full as they became under Soviet rule, with long lines forming in front of confessional booths. The western Ukrainian people attempted to protect their Church from Soviet restrictions. Peasants, even among the poorest ones, were reluctant to accept land taken from the Church and offered to them, and as late as May 1940 some villages had not yet expropriated church lands, while others distributed much of it to priests' families. Priests made homeless were taken in by parishioners. Children, who no longer learned religion in school, obtained religious instruction privately. The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church in Volhynia faced similar restrictions to those of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church; moreover it underwent pressure to subordinate itself to the Moscow Patriarch. Many Orthodox priests fled the Soviet regime, resulting in a large number of newly consecrated priests who were not necessarily fit for their duties, weakening and demoralizing the Church somewhat. The Orthodox hierarchs in western Ukraine were left alone, however.John Armstrong (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp.192‚Äì196 ===Deportations and demographic changes=== Initially, the Soviet authorities deported primarily political figures as well as all Polish officials, civil servants, police, and Polish citizens who had fled from the Germans. The exact number of Poles deported to Siberia or Central Asia between 1939 and 1941 remains unknown, and has been estimated at from under 500,000 to over 1,500,000., p.219 In Bukovina, in accordance with the agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany, most of the region's large German minority was repatriated. The German consul also evacuated many local Ukrainian leaders and Orthodox priests, many of whom subsequently joined the Melnyk branch of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists abroad. Tens of thousands of German- speaking people from Volhynia were also moved to German-controlled territory. In April 1940 the Soviet authorities in the annexed territories began to extend their repressive measures towards the general Ukrainian population. This coincided with the removal of Soviet troops of ethnic Ukrainian origin, who had become too friendly with local Ukrainians, and their replacement by soldiers from Central Asia. The Soviet authorities began arresting and deporting anyone suspected of disloyalty to the Soviet regime. In villages, people were denounced by their neighbors, some of whom were Communist sympathizers while others were opportunists. Deportations became indiscriminate, and people and their families were deported for \\"crimes\\" such as having relatives or visiting abroad, or visiting friends while the friends were arrested. Because many of those making denunciations were perceived to be Jews, anti-Jewish sentiments among the Ukrainian population increased. Ultimately, between 1939 and the beginning of Operation Barbarossa approximately 500,000 Ukrainians would be deported to Siberia and central Asia. 100,000s of Jews fleeing Nazi terror in German-occupied Poland arrived in the territories newly annexed by the USSR.Timothy Snyder. (2010). Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin. New York: Basic Books, pg. 127 ==Aftermath== People, some of them in Ukrainian national dress, greeting Nazi Soldiers in 1941 On June 22, 1941 Operation Barbarossa began, and western Ukraine was captured within weeks. Prior to retreating, the Soviet authorities, unwilling to evacuate prisoners, chose to kill all inmates whether or not they had committed major or minor crimes and whether or not they were held for political reasons. Estimates of the number of people killed vary from 15,000 to 40,000. Due to the brutality of the Soviet administration, many Ukrainians initially welcomed the German invasion. On June 30, 1941, Ukrainian nationalist commandos under German command captured Lviv which had been evacuated by Soviet forces and declared an independent state allied with Nazi Germany. This movement was quashed by the Germans, who split up western Ukraine. Northern Bukovina was returned to Germany's ally, Romania. Galicia, which had once been part of Austria, was made part of the General Government together with occupied Poland, while Volhynia was split off and attached to the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. All of these regions would be captured and reintegrated into Soviet Ukraine in 1944. ==Importance for the Ukrainian and Belarusian statehood== The Soviet annexation of some 51.6% of the territory of the Second Polish Republic, where about 13,200,000 people lived in 1939 including Poles and Jews, was an important event in the history of contemporary Ukraine and Belarus, because it brought within Ukrainian and Belarusian SSR new territories inhabited in part by ethnic Ukrainian and Belarusian people, and thus unified previously separated branches of these nations. The postwar population transfers imposed by Joseph Stalin, and the Holocaust, solidified the mono-ethnic character of these lands by nearly a complete eradication of the Polish and Jewish presence there. Ukraine and Belarus achieved independence in 1991 after the fall of the Soviet Union and became nation states delineated by borders of the 50-year-old republics. p. 17. \\"The process of amalgamation ‚Äì wrote Orest Subtelny, a Canadian historian of Ukrainian descent ‚Äì was not only a major aspect of the post-war period, but an event of epochal significance in the history of Ukraine.\\"Subtelny (1988), p. 487. ==See also== *Russian occupation of Eastern Galicia, 1914‚Äì1915 ==References== Category:Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic Category:History of Ukraine (1918‚Äì1991) Category:Poland in World War II Category:History of the Soviet Union Category:Annexation Category:Territorial disputes of the Soviet Union Category:Poland‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Category:Soviet Union‚ÄìUkraine relations Category:September 1939 events ","title":"Soviet annexation of Eastern Galicia, Volhynia and Northern Bukovina"},{"id":"20180971","text":"John Halsey (born 23 February 1945) is a rock drummer, best known for his appearance in the television film All You Need is Cash (1978) as Barrington Womble (\\"Barry Wom\\") of The Rutles.

He co-founded and former President of Erwin-Penland Advertising, is a former Chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, and co-founded the thought leadership conference Food for Thought in 2008. Currently owns Erwin Creates and the co-working space in Downtown Greenville South Carolina, Endeavor Greenville (www.endeavorgreenville.com). == Early years == Erwin was born October 23, 1956 in Florence, South Carolina to Isabel Erwin Kelly and Henry Erwin. Henry died following a brief illness when Joe was 12, and his mother raised Joe and his younger brother Tony. After living in North Carolina and Florida, the Erwins moved to Greenville, South Carolina in 1968 to be closer to family. Erwin attended public schools and graduated from Eastside High School in Greenville in 1975. At Eastside, he served as student body president, the editorial page editor of the school's newspaper, and captained the undefeated varsity soccer team. Following graduation, Erwin enrolled at Clemson University. He was an Intramural Debate champion, an International Debate representative, a varsity cheerleader, and in his senior year, the head cheerleader (also known as the \\"Mic Man\\"). He was named an NCAA All-American in 1978. Erwin graduated from Clemson in 1979 with a B.A. in Political Science. Joe married Gretchen Getchell Erwin in 1984, and they have two children: Douglas (b. 1988) and Valerie (b. 1990). They live in Greenville, South Carolina and are members of Christ Church Episcopal. == Marketing executive == Following graduation, Erwin worked at Leslie Advertising in Greenville, initially in the media department and later as an account executive. In 1982 he was recruited to New York to join national agency Benton & Bowles (later DMB&B;) to work on the Corning Glass and Quincy's Family Steakhouse accounts. In addition to account executive duties, Erwin began to write copy‚Äìultimately serving as copywriter for John Madden's broadcast campaign for Quincy's. After their marriage in 1984, Gretchen moved to New York and joined the Media Department at Dancer Fitzgerald Sample (later Saatchi & Saatchi). While in New York, Joe, Gretchen and their friend Allen Bosworth began to talk of returning south to open an agency of their own. Joe and Gretchen purchased Penland Advertising in Greenville, South Carolina, in 1986, renaming the new agency Erwin-Penland. Allen Bosworth remained in New York for two years before joining EP as Director of Client Service in 1988. Joe served as President and Creative Director, while Gretchen led the Media Department. Since opening in 1986 with one account and one employee, Erwin- Penland has seen expansion. Now with more than 200 employees working across all marketing disciplines, clients include Verizon Wireless, Denny's, Confluence Watersports, Fatz Cafe, ScanSource, Lockheed Martin and BI-LO Supermarkets. Erwin-Penland is a member of the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA's), and the Intermarket Agency Network. Erwin- Penland is known for \\"integrated marketing solutions\\"‚Äìprimarily for retail accounts. == Political activity == While at Clemson, Erwin was a member of College Democrats, and volunteered for a number of campaigns, including future South Carolina Congressman Jim Clyburn's campaign for Secretary of State, Richard W. Riley's campaign for governor, and Jimmy Carter's presidential race. During the 1980s and 1990s, he campaigned for South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges, U.S. Senator Ernest Hollings, South Carolina Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum, and statewide candidates Steve Benjamin and Rick Wade. Erwin was elected Chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party in 2003, and completed his second two-year term in May 2007. During that time, he negotiated and produced two Democratic presidential debates‚Äìone in Greenville in 2003 and one in Orangeburg in 2007‚Äìthat were broadcast live nationally on NBC. The Greenville debate was the last debate moderated by Tom Brokaw before he left the anchor chair at NBC News. Erwin chose to hold the 2007 debate on the campus of South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, marking the first time a presidential primary debate had been held at an historically black college or university. Erwin's four-year chairmanship focused on reorganization at the grassroots level; holding a successful, volunteer-run statewide Democratic presidential primary in 2004; producing the two Democratic presidential debates; and seeking the right for South Carolina to hold its 2008 Democratic presidential primary in the \\"pre-window\\" period‚Äìas the only primary between the New Hampshire primary and Super Tuesday. South Carolina competed against 10 other states and the District of Columbia for the early primary designation, and ultimately was chosen by the DNC to join New Hampshire as the only other state with a pre-window primary. The January 2008 Democratic presidential primary, in which South Carolina Democrats turned out in record numbers and outpolled Republicans by more than 88,000 votes, was a watershed event in the 2008 Democratic presidential nominating process. Senator Barack Obama won the primary with 55% of the vote. When Erwin's term as chair expired in May 2007, he chose not to seek re-election, but remained involved in politics. During his chairmanship he remained neutral in the primary battle, seeking to engage all voters and help all candidates grow their South Carolina campaigns. In fall 2007, however, he endorsed Senator Barack Obama for president, and campaigned with and for the senator in the months leading up to the January 2008 primary. == Community service == Erwin is an Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award Winner,Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Hall of Fame was inducted into Greenville Tech's Entrepreneurs Forum in 2000 and is a member of the Clemson University Entrepreneurs' Roundtable. He served on the Executive Committee of the Greenville Chamber of Commerce, and was a member of South Carolina Governor Jim Hodges' Commission on Teacher Quality. In September 2008 Erwin was elected to the national board of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. He also serves on the Boards of the Upstate Alliance and the BI-LO Charity Classic, and served as 2008 upstate campaign co-chair for the United Negro College Fund. He is a graduate of the Diversity Leadership Academy at Furman University. == Food for Thought == In 2008, Joe Erwin and members of Erwin- Penland's leadership team created and hosted the first annual Food for Thought conference. This event brought leaders from around the country to Greenville for an experiential \\"unconventional convention,\\" showcasing and inspiring creative thinking across business, non-profit, artistic, educational and culinary endeavors. == References  * Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:American marketing people Category:College Democrats Category:People from Florence, South Carolina Category:State political party chairs of South Carolina ","title":"Joe Erwin"},{"id":"20181036","text":"Peintre officiel de la Marine Shoulder insignia of Andr√© Hambourg.

Her background is diverse, with one grandfather a merchant from Yunnan and another a colonial officer from Great Britain. Law-Yone states that she is \\"half Burman, a quarter Chinese and a quarter English\\". Law-Yone has indicated that her father's imprisonment under the military regime limited her options in the country. She was barred from university, but not allowed to leave the country. In 1967, an attempt to escape to Thailand failed and she was imprisoned, but managed to leave Burma as a stateless person. She relocated to the United States in 1973, attending Eckerd College for comparative literature and modern languages before receiving a Carnegie Fellowship and settling in Washington, D.C. for thirty years.Yoo and Ho, 283 In 1987, she was the recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts Literature Award for Creative Writing.http://arts.endow.gov/pub/NEA In 2002, she received a David T.K. Wong Creative Writing Fellowship from the University of East Anglia. Her novel The Road to Wanting was long-listed for the Orange Prize 2011.Retrieved 22 March 2011. In 2015, she was D√ºrrenmatt guest professor at University of Bern, Switzerland.(in German) Retrieved 22 March 2016. Law-Yone cites as a strong influence on her writing career her father's love of language, noting that his work as the founder of Burmese English-language newspaper The Nation was a daily factor in her childhood.Yoo and Ho, 286. ==Selected bibliography== * The Coffin Tree (1983) * Irrawaddy Tango (1993) * The Road to Wanting (2010) * Golden Parasol: A Daughter's Memoir of Burma (2013) ==Further reading== *Law-Yone, Wendy.

Solyaris) is a 1972 Soviet science fiction art film based on Stanis≈Çaw Lem's novel of the same name published in 1961. The film was co- written and directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, and stars Donatas Banionis and Natalya Bondarchuk. The electronic music score was performed by Eduard Artemyev; a composition by J.S. Bach is also employed. The plot centers on a space station orbiting the fictional planet Solaris, where a scientific mission has stalled because the skeleton crew of three scientists have fallen into emotional crises. Psychologist Kris Kelvin (Banionis) travels to the station in order to evaluate the situation, only to encounter the same mysterious phenomena as the others. The film was Tarkovsky's attempt to bring a new emotional depth to science fiction films; he viewed most western works in the genre as shallow due to their focus on technological invention. Solaris won the Grand Prix Sp√©cial du Jury and the FIPRESCI prize at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. It received generally positive reviews from critics. It is often cited as one of the greatest science fiction films in the history of cinema. Some of the ideas Tarkovsky expresses in this film are further developed in his film Stalker (1979). ==Plot== Psychologist Kris Kelvin is being sent on an interstellar journey to evaluate whether a decades-old space station should continue to study the oceanic planet Solaris. He spends his last day on Earth with his elderly father and retired pilot Berton. Years earlier Berton had been part of an exploratory team at Solaris but was recalled when he described seeing a four- meter-tall child on the surface of the water. This was dismissed as a hallucination by a panel of scientists, but now that the remaining crew members are making similarly strange reports, Kris's skills are needed. Upon his arrival at Solaris Station, a scientific research station, none of the three remaining scientists bother to greet Kelvin, and he finds the space station in dangerous disarray. He soon learns that his friend among the scientists, Dr. Gibarian, has killed himself. The two surviving crewmen‚ÄîSnaut and Sartorius‚Äîare uncooperative and evasive. Kelvin catches fleeting glimpses of others aboard the station who were not part of the original crew. He also finds that Gibarian left him a rambling, cryptic farewell video message, warning him about the station. After a fitful sleep, Kelvin is shocked to find Hari, his late wife, in his sleeping quarters. She is unaware of how she got there. Terrified by her presence, Kelvin launches the replica of his wife into outer space. Snaut explains that the \\"visitors\\" began appearing after the scientists conducted radiation experiments using X-rays in a desperate attempt to understand the planet's nature. That evening, Hari reappears in his quarters. This time Kelvin calmly accepts her and they fall asleep together in an embrace. Hari panics when Kelvin briefly leaves her alone in the room, and injures herself. But before Kelvin can give first aid, her injuries spontaneously heal before his eyes. Sartorius and Snaut explain to Kelvin that Solaris created Hari from his memories of her. The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of \\"neutrino systems\\" but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of a device known as \\"the annihilator\\". Later, Snaut proposes beaming Kelvin's brainwave patterns at Solaris in hopes that it will understand them and stop the disturbing apparitions. In time, Hari becomes independent and is able to exist away from Kelvin's presence. She learns from Sartorius that the original Hari had committed suicide ten years earlier. Sartorius, Snaut, Kelvin and Hari gather together for a birthday party, which evolves into a philosophical argument, during which Sartorius reminds Hari that she is not real. Distressed, Hari kills herself again by drinking liquid oxygen, only to painfully resurrect after a few minutes. On the surface of Solaris, the ocean begins to swirl faster into a funnel. Kelvin becomes ill and goes to sleep. He dreams of his mother as a young woman, washing away dirt or scabs from his arm. When he awakens, Hari is gone; Snaut reads her farewell note, in which she describes how she petitioned the two scientists to destroy her. Snaut then tells Kelvin that since they broadcast Kelvin's brainwaves into Solaris, the visitors had stopped appearing and islands began forming on the planet surface. Kelvin debates whether or not to return to Earth or to remain with Solaris. Kelvin meets with his father at their dacha. The camera zooms out to reveal that it is on an island in Solaris's ocean. ==CastProductionWriting=== In 1968 the director Andrei Tarkovsky had several motives for cinematically adapting Stanis≈Çaw Lem's science fiction novel Solaris (1961). First, he admired Lem's work. Second, he needed work and money, because his previous film, Andrei Rublev (1966), had gone unreleased, and his screenplay A White, White Day had been rejected (in 1975 it was realised as The Mirror). A film of a novel by Lem, a popular and critically respected writer in the USSR, was a logical commercial and artistic choice. Another inspiration was Tarkovsky's desire to bring emotional depth to the science-fiction genre, which he regarded as shallow due to its attention to technological invention; in a 1970 interview, he singled out Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey as \\"phoney on many points\\" and \\"a lifeless schema with only pretensions to truth\\". Tarkovsky and Lem collaborated and remained in communication about the adaptation. With Fridrikh Gorenshtein, Tarkovsky co-wrote the first screenplay in the summer of 1969; two-thirds of it occurred on Earth. The Mosfilm committee disliked it, and Lem became furious over the drastic alteration of his novel. The final screenplay yielded the shooting script, which has less action on Earth and deletes Kelvin's marriage to his second wife, Maria, from the story. In the novel Lem describes science's inadequacy in allowing humans to communicate with an alien life form, because certain forms, at least, of sentient extra-terrestrial life may operate well outside of human experience and understanding. In the movie, Tarkovsky concentrates on Kelvin's feelings for his wife, Hari, and the impact of outer space exploration on the human condition. Dr. Gibarian's monologue (from the novel's sixth chapter) is the highlight of the final library scene, wherein Snaut says: \\"We don't need other worlds. We need mirrors\\". Unlike the novel, which begins with Kelvin's spaceflight and takes place entirely on Solaris, the film shows Kelvin's visit to his parents' house in the country before leaving Earth. The contrast establishes the worlds in which he lives ‚Äì a vibrant Earth versus an austere, closed-in space station orbiting Solaris ‚Äì demonstrating and questioning space exploration's impact on the human psyche. A detail of The Hunters in the Snow (1565) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, a thematic reference The set design of Solaris features paintings by the Old Masters. The interior of the space station is decorated with full reproductions of the 1565 painting cycle of The Months (The Hunters in the Snow, The Gloomy Day, The Hay Harvest, The Harvesters, and The Return of the Herd), by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, and details of Landscape with the Fall of Icarus and The Hunters in the Snow (1565). The scene of Kelvin kneeling before his father and the father embracing him alludes to The Return of the Prodigal Son (1669) by Rembrandt. The references and allusions are Tarkovsky's efforts to give the young art of cinema historical perspective, to evoke the viewer's feeling that cinema is a mature art. The film references Tarkovsky's 1966 film Andrei Rublev by having an icon by Andrei Rublev being placed in Kelvin's room. It is the second of a series of three films referencing Rublev, the last being Tarkovsky's next film, The Mirror, which was made in 1975 and which references Andrei Rublev by having a poster of the film hung on a wall. ===The cast=== Tarkovsky initially wanted his ex-wife, Irma Raush, to play Hari, but after meeting Swedish actress Bibi Andersson in June 1970, he decided that she was better for the role. Wishing to work with Tarkovsky, Andersson agreed to be paid in rubles. Nevertheless, Natalya Bondarchuk was ultimately cast as Hari. Tarkovsky had met her when they were students at the State Institute of Cinematography. It was she who had introduced the novel Solaris to him. Tarkovsky auditioned her in 1970, but decided she was too young for the part. He instead recommended her to director Larisa Shepitko, who cast her in You and I. Half a year later, Tarkovsky screened that film and was so pleasantly surprised by her performance that he decided to cast Bondarchuk as Hari after all. Tarkovsky cast Lithuanian actor Donatas Banionis as Kelvin, the Estonian actor J√ºri J√§rvet as Snaut, the Russian actor Anatoly Solonitsyn as Sartorius, the Ukrainian actor Nikolai Grinko as Kelvin's father, and Olga Barnet as Kelvin's mother. The director had already worked with Solonitsyn, who had played Andrei Rublev, and with Grinko, who appeared in Andrei Rublev and Ivan's Childhood (1962). Tarkovsky thought Solonitsyn and Grinko would need extra directorial assistance. After filming was almost completed, Tarkovsky rated actors and performances thus: Bondarchuk, J√§rvet, Solonitsyn, Banionis, Dvorzhetsky, and Grinko; he also wrote in his diary that \\"Natalya B. has outshone everybody\\". ===Filming=== In the summer of 1970 the USSR State Committee for Cinematography (Goskino SSSR) authorized the production of Solaris, with a length of , equivalent to a two-hour-twenty-minute running time. The exteriors were photographed at Zvenigorod, near Moscow; the interiors were photographed at the Mosfilm studios. The scenes of space pilot Berton driving through a city were photographed in September and October 1971 at Akasaka and Iikura in Tokyo. The original plan was to film futuristic structures at the World Expo '70, but the trip was delayed. The shooting began in March 1971 with cinematographer Vadim Yusov, who also photographed Tarkovsky's previous films. They quarreled so much on this film that they never worked together again. Eastman Kodak color film was used in the color scenes. Not widely available in the Soviet Union, it had to be specially procured for the production.https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1332/1db72ca05c6cdd493c10118216927172f547.pdf The first version of Solaris was completed in December 1971. Solaris locale: Akasaka, Tokyo, the future city that space pilot Henri Berton traverses in his car The Solaris ocean was created with acetone, aluminium powder, and dyes. Mikhail Romadin designed the space station as lived-in, beat-up and decrepit rather than shiny, neat and futuristic. The designer and director consulted with scientist and aerospace engineer Lupichev, who lent them a 1960s-era mainframe computer for set decoration. For some of the sequences, Romadin designed a mirror room that enabled Yusov to hide within a mirrored sphere so as to be invisible in the finished film. Akira Kurosawa, who was visiting the Mosfilm studios just then, expressed admiration for the space station design. In January 1972 the State Committee for Cinematography requested editorial changes before releasing Solaris. These included a more realistic film with a clearer image of the future and deletion of allusions to God and Christianity. Tarkovsky successfully resisted such major changes, and after a few minor edits Solaris was approved for release in March 1972. ===Music=== The soundtrack of Solaris features Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale prelude for organ Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 639, played by , and an electronic score by Eduard Artemyev. The prelude is the central musical theme. Tarkovsky initially wanted the film to be devoid of music and asked Artemyev to orchestrate ambient sounds as the score. The latter proposed subtly introducing orchestral music. In counterpoint to classical music as Earth's theme, is fluid electronic music as the theme for the planet Solaris. The character of Hari has her own subtheme, a cantus firmus based on Bach's music featuring Artemyev's music atop it; it is heard at Hari's death and at the story's end. ==Reception and legacy== Solaris premiered at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix Sp√©cial du Jury and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. In the USSR, the film premiered in the Mir film theater in Moscow on February 5, 1973. Tarkovsky did not consider the Mir cinema the best projection venue. Despite the film's narrow release in only five film theaters in the USSR, the film sold 10.5 million tickets. Unlike the vast majority of commercial and ideological films in the 1970s, Solaris was screened in the USSR in limited runs for 15 years without any breaks, giving it cult status. In the Eastern Bloc and in the West, Solaris premiered later. In the United States, a version of Solaris that was truncated by 30 minutes premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on October 6, 1976. Although Lem worked with Tarkovsky and Friedrich Gorenstein in developing the screenplay, Lem maintained he \\"never really liked Tarkovsky's version\\" of his novel. Tarkovsky wanted a film based on the novel but artistically independent of it, while Lem opposed any divergence of the screenplay from the novel. Lem went as far as to say that Tarkovsky made Crime and Punishment rather than Solaris, omitting epistemological and cognitive aspects of his book.S.Beres'. Rozmowy ze Stanislawem Lemem, Krakow, WL, 1987, s.133‚Äì135. But Lem also said in an interview that he had only seen part of the finale, much later, after Tarkovsky's death.Andrej Tarkovskij: Klassiker ‚Äì –ö–ª–∞—Å—Å–∏–∫ ‚Äì Classic ‚Äì Classico: Beitr√§ge zum internationalen Tarkovskij-Symposium an der Universit√§t Potsdam ; Band 1, 2016, , p. 60. Tarkovsky claimed that Lem did not fully appreciate cinema and expected the film to merely illustrate the novel without creating an original cinematic piece. Tarkovsky's film is about the inner lives of its scientists. Lem's novel is about the conflicts of man's condition in nature and the nature of man in the universe. For Tarkovsky, Lem's exposition of that existential conflict was the starting point for depicting the characters' inner lives. In the autobiographical documentary Voyage in Time (1983), Tarkovsky says he viewed Solaris as an artistic failure because it did not transcend genre as he believed his film Stalker (1979) did, due to the required technological dialogue and special effects. M. Galina in the 1997 article Identifying Fears called this film \\"one of the biggest events in the Soviet science fiction cinema\\" and one of the few that do not seem anachronistic nowadays. A list of \\"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\\" compiled by Empire magazine in 2010 ranked Tarkovsky's Solaris at No. 68. In 2002, Steven Soderbergh wrote and directed an American adaptation of Solaris, which starred George Clooney. Salman Rushdie has called Solaris \\"a sci-fi masterpiece\\", adding, \\"This exploration of the unreliability of reality and the power of the human unconscious, this great examination of the limits of rationalism and the perverse power of even the most ill-fated love, needs to be seen as widely as possible before it's transformed by Steven Soderbergh and James Cameron into what they ludicrously threaten will be 2001 meets Last Tango in Paris. What, sex in space with floating butter? Tarkovsky must be turning over in his grave.\\"Rushdie, Salman. Step Across This Line: Collected Nonfiction 1992‚Äì2002. New York: Random House, 2002, p. 335. Film critic Roger Ebert reviewed the 1976 release for The Chicago Sun-Times, giving the film three out of four stars and writing, \\"Solaris isn't a fast-moving action picture; it's a thoughtful, deep, sensitive movie that uses the freedom of science fiction to examine human nature. It starts slow, but once you get involved, it grows on you.'https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/solaris-1976 He added Solaris to his \\"Great Movies\\" list in 2003, saying he had initially \\"balked\\" at its length and pacing but later came to admire Tarkovsky's goals. \\"No director makes greater demands on our patience. Yet his admirers are passionate and they have reason for their feelings: Tarkovsky consciously tried to create art that was great and deep. He held to a romantic view of the individual able to transform reality through his own spiritual and philosophical strength.\\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie- solaris-1972 Ebert later compared the 2011 film Another Earth to Solaris, writing that Another Earth \\"is as thought-provoking, in a less profound way, as Tarkovsky's Solaris, another film about a sort of parallel Earth\\". In an example of life imitating art, Natalya Bondarchuk (Hari) revealed in a 2010 interview that she fell in love with Tarkovsky during the filming of Solaris and, after their relationship ended, became suicidal. She claims that her decision was partly influenced by her role. Adam Curtis's 2015 documentary film Bitter Lake includes scenes from this film. The metaphor is that just as the planet influences the cosmonauts who try to influence the planet, there have been cross influences among Afghanistan and its Soviet, American and British invaders. The film was selected for screening as part of the Cannes Classics section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. The film also has a \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating of 95% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 reviews with an average rating of 8.54 out of 10, with the consensus reading: \\"Solaris is a haunting, meditative film that uses sci-fi to raise complex questions about humanity and existence.\\" It also has a score of 90 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\".https://www.metacritic.com/movie/solaris-re-release ==Home media== Solaris was released on LaserDisc in Japan in 1986. On May 24, 2011, The Criterion Collection released Solaris on Blu-ray Disc. The most noticeable difference from the previous 2002 Criterion DVD release was that the blue and white tinted monochrome scenes from the film were restored. ==See also== * List of films featuring space stations * Cinema of the Soviet Union * Ocean planet ==References* * . * * Video ‚Äì Solaris (divided into two parts) ‚Äì Mosfilm site [Eng subs/click \\"cc\\"]. *Solaris: Inner Space an essay by Phillip Lopate at the Criterion Collection Category:1972 films Category:1970s science fiction drama films Category:1970s psychological drama films Category:Soviet films Category:Soviet science fiction drama films Category:Russian-language films Category:Ocean planets in fiction Category:Film adaptations disliked by their authors Category:Films about psychiatry Category:Films based on Polish novels Category:Films based on science fiction novels Category:Films based on works by Stanis≈Çaw Lem Category:Films directed by Andrei Tarkovsky Category:Films scored by Eduard Artemyev Category:Films set on fictional planets Category:Films shot in Crimea Category:Films shot in Moscow Category:Films shot in Moscow Oblast Category:Films shot in Tokyo Category:Films partially in color Category:Metaphysical fiction films Category:Mosfilm films Category:Russian nonlinear narrative films Category:Russian science fiction drama films Category:Space adventure films Category:Existentialist works Category:Foreign films shot in Japan Category:1972 drama films ","title":"Solaris (1972 film)"},{"id":"20181219","text":"The golden spider beetle, Niptus hololeucus, is a species of spider beetle in the family Ptinidae. ==Description== Niptus hololeucus is 3‚Äì4.5mm in length.

The Bavarian football federation decided on drastic changes to the league system from 2012 onwards. With the introduction of the Regionalliga Bayern from 2012 to 2013, it placed two Bayernligas, north and south, below the new league as the new fifth tier of the German league system. Below those, five Landesligas instead of the existing three were set, which would be geographically divided to limit travel and increase the number of local derbies.Attraktive Gegner, regionale Einteilung, weniger Fahrtkosten BFV.de. 12 February 2011. Retrieved 29 April 2011 == History and modus == In 1963, alongside the establishment of the Bundesliga, a single-division, highest league for the state of Bavaria, the Amateurliga Bayern was established, too.

In turn, the bottom three teams in the Bayernliga were relegated to the Landesliga, according to their region of origin. In 1978, the Amateurliga Bayern was renamed Amateur Oberliga Bayern. In 1981, this modus changed as the Bavarian football association wanted each runners-up team in the Bavarian leagues to have a chance for promotion, too. Nowadays, the statutes of the BFV actually specify that every runners-up in Bavaria has the right to take part in promotion round, providing the league it can earn promotion to is part of the Bavarian football league system.BFV Spielordnung - ¬ß 16 Allgemeine Vorschriften (2) BFV regulations.

A draw would establish which two teams met each other in the first round in an on-off game, with all games to be played on neutral grounds, preferably at a location half-way between the two clubs. The winners of those two games would then advance to a final to determine the team that would play in the Bayernliga next season. Exceptions existed in regards to the number of teams promoted. If the Bayernliga champion managed to win promotion to the 2. Bundesliga and no team from that league was relegated to the Bayernliga, an extra team was promoted from the Landesliga. Also, in 1994, due to the formation of the Regionalligas, eight teams from the Landesligas earned promotion to the Bayernliga with the promotion round being played between the third placed teams.Die Bayernliga 1945 - 1997 DSFS. 1996. p. 129.

Of the 108 requests made, 5 were approved to receive $8.4 billion, with the majority of that amount under repayment. == Background and criteria == The loan program was authorized under section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which provided the program with $25 billion in loan authority, supported by a $7.5 billion appropriation to fund the credit subsidy, or the 30% risk profile expected for projects of this type. To qualify, automakers and eligible component manufacturers must promise to increase the fuel economy of their products by 25% over the average fuel economy of similar 2005 models, and apply the loans to future investments \\"reasonably related to the reequipping, expanding, or establishing a manufacturing facility in the U.S.\\" In distributing the loans the DOE may decide which technologies it believes are most promising and deserving of assistance. Loan recipients must also be \\"financially viable\\" for the length of the loan. Given 60 days by congressional statute to issue an interim final rule, the Department of Energy (DOE), responsible for overseeing the program, finalized the rule 36 days later on November 5, 2008 (compared to 18 months usually needed for such rule making). This program is unrelated to the United States Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) which has been providing bailout funding to two of the big three U.S. automakers to reduce the effects of the 2008‚Äì10 automotive industry crisis on the United States. The two programs were enacted during the Automotive industry crisis of 2008‚Äì10, but with different purposes. It has been speculated that at least two of the Big Three U.S. automobile manufacturers may not be able to qualify for this program because of its fuel economy and financial solvency requirements. In November 2008, the auto industry began lobbying for the $25 billion to be loaned immediately, as well as another $25 billion to be loaned later to cover retirees health care costs. As originally worded, the program was applicable only to four-wheeled passenger vehicles. In October 2009, a bill sponsored by California Representatives Brian Bilbray and Adam Schiff was passed extending the program's coverage to include high mileage (75 mpg equivalent) two- and three-wheeled vehicles. == DOE's Alternative Vehicle Technologies Awards == The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced in December 2008 the selection of six cost-shared research projects for the development and demonstration of alternative vehicle technology projects totaling a DOE investment of up to $14.55 million over three years, subject to annual appropriations. Private sector contributions will further increase the financial investment for a total of up to $29.3 million. The selections announced are part of DOE‚Äôs continuing work to develop high efficiency vehicle technologies and are not part of the recently announced $25 billion Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program. These projects were selected under three diverse topic areas: lithium-ion battery materials and manufacturing (3M Company for developing advanced anode; BASF Catalyst for domestic production of low cost cathode materials and FMC Corporation for scaling up production of stabilized lithium metal powder for high energy cathodes); thermoelectric heating, ventilation and air conditioning (TE HVAC system); and aerodynamic heavy-duty truck trailers (Navistar International Corporation). == Conditional loans  Overview === USDOE announced in 2009 $8.4 billion in conditional loan agreements for Ford Motor Company; Nissan North America, Inc.; Tesla Motors, Inc. and Fisker Automotive to fund the development of advanced vehicle technologies. Additionally, DOE has spent approximately $3.3 billion on credit subsidy costs securing the loans. The loan commitments include a $5.9 billion loan to Ford for upgrading factories in five states to produce 13 more fuel-efficient models, a $1.6 billion loan to Nissan to build advanced electric vehicles and advanced batteries, and a $465 million loan to Tesla Motors to manufacture its new electric sedan. These are the first conditional loans released under DOE's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Loan Program, which is using an open, competitive process to provide about $25 billion in loans to companies that produce cars or vehicle components in the United States. To qualify, companies must propose projects that increase fuel economy to at least 25% above 2005 fuel economy levels. By 2014, Ford and Nissan were making payments, while Tesla paid back the loan in 2013. The program had not issued new loans since 2011, and by 2020 six applicants were seeking around $12 billion of loans. The program has earned the government nearly $3 billion in interest. The government suggested shutting down the program. === Ford === Ford Motor Company will receive its loans through 2011, using the funds to upgrade its engine plants in Dearborn, Michigan; Cleveland, Ohio; and Lima, Ohio, and to upgrade its transmission plants in Livonia, Michigan; Sterling Heights, Michigan; and Sharonville, Ohio. Ford will also upgrade its assembly plants in Chicago, Illinois; Louisville, Kentucky; Dearborn, Michigan; Wayne, Michigan; and Kansas City, Missouri, converting two of the truck factories into assembly plants for cars. In addition, the Ford loans will finance advances in traditional combustion engines and electrified vehicles and help raise the fuel efficiency of more than two dozen popular models. The V6 EcoBoost engine benefited from the loan, and is installed in many cars as well as over 500,000 F-150, saving 268 million gallons of gasoline by 2014. Ford expects to pay the rest of the loan by 2023. === Nissan === Nissan aims to manufacture a cost-competitive electric vehicle with a lithium-ion battery pack in Smyrna, Tennessee, and plans to eventually reach a production capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year. The Nissan Leaf is produced at Nissan's Smyrna assembly plant since 2013, along with cells for its batteries.Driving Economic Growth: ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY VEHICLES MANUFACTURING January 2016 Nissan repaid the loan in 2017. === Tesla === Tesla Motors will use its funding () to finance a California-based manufacturing facility for the Tesla Model S sedan, an all-electric sedan that can be recharged at a conventional 120-volt or 240-volt outlet. Production will begin in 2011 and ramp up to 20,000 vehicles per year by the end of 2013. Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, and was the first car company to have fully repaid the government, while Ford, Nissan and Fisker had not. === Fisker === The fourth conditional commitment the Department of Energy has entered into under the ATVM Loan program is a $528.7 million loan for Fisker Automotive for the development of two lines of plug-in hybrids by 2016. Fisker received $192 million, but later defaulted. DOE reclaimed $28 million from Fisker for a total of $53 million recovered of its $192 million loan. == Unsuccessful applications == About 108 requests were made to the program by 2010, but few were approved. Many of the companies which were denied loans have since gone out of business. Among the denied were: * A loan request under this program was denied for Carbon Motors Corporation in March 2012 after the latter had spent 2 years prior addressing the DOE's concerns. * Aptera Motors' initial application was denied because its product was a three-wheeled vehicle; the wording on the program was modified to allow high-mileage three-wheelers and Aptera reapplied, however the company went out of business before the DOE responded to their second application. * Brammo asked for $45 million, application was rejected. * Local Motors' Local Motors initial application (filed in 2009) was rejected, company said to be working on resubmission. * Bright Automotive, who filed their application in 2008, went out of business in March 2012 after waiting 4 years for the DOE to respond and being unable to sustain continued operations. * CODA * Revolution Motors * Next Auto Works * XP Vehicles - sued the U.S. Department of Energy http://jalopnik.com/meet-the-inflatable-car-inventor- suing-the-u-s-for-504488747 == See also == * Fisker Automotive * Plug-in hybrid * Tesla Motors == References  *Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program - Official website * * * Category:United States federal energy legislation Category:Energy policy of the United States ","title":"Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program"},{"id":"20181340","text":"Canada Camp was a Palestinian refugee camp in the northern Sinai near Rafah, formed in 1972 and evacuated in 2000. The Camp was named after the Canadian contingent of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I), which formerly had a camp at the location. Most refugees were relocated to Tel al-Sultan in southern Gaza. ==Establishment== In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel conquered the Sinai and the adjacent Gaza Strip. In 1970/71, Israel demolished homes in Rafah for road widening under the pretension of security measures.Population of Palestinian Refugees in Camps (official and unofficial), 31 March 2007 . Badil \\"During the 1970s, the Israeli military administration destroyed thousands of refugee shelters in the occupied Gaza Strip under the guise of security. Large refugee camps were targeted in particular. Refugees were forcefully resettled in other areas of the occupied Gaza Strip, with a smaller number transferred to the occupied West Bank. In the occupied Gaza Strip, several housing projects were established for these refugees. Some of these projects today are referred to as camps. These include the Canada project (1972), the Shuqairi project (1973), the Brazil project (1973), the Sheikh Radwan project (1974), and the al-Amal project (1979).\\"Initial review: Canada Camp Relocation . By Ron Wilkinson, Foreign Affairs Trade and Development Canada, May 2001 (doc). Here available Sixteen thousand Palestinian refugees, a quarter of them in Rafah were forced to relocate when their shelters were destroyed by the Israeli authorities. At least two thousand of the displaced were moved to al-Arish, in the occupied Sinai, and several hundred to the West Bank.Razing Rafah, Map 2: Rafah Features. HRW, October 2004 In 1972, the Canada Camp Housing Project was established in Egyptian Rafah, just across the international boundary with Sinai, initiated by the Israeli Government. UNRWA provided schooling and some medical care with staff who had also been stranded across the border. The refugees had no right to work in Egypt and were provided with food rations and minimal amounts of cash aid. Talhami, G. H. 2003. Palestinian Refugees: Pawns to Political Actors. Nova Publishers, 2003 , This camp became known as \\"Canada Camp\\", named after the Canadian contingent of the UNEF, which formerly had a camp at the location. A similar housing project was developed in 1973 in the Gazan part of Rafah, called \\"Brazil Camp\\" after the Brazilian UNEF contingent.Canada Camp . Foreign Affairs Trade and Development Canada, 29 April 2013 UNEF I was the first United nations Emergency Force, operating from November 1956 to June 1967 to serve as a buffer between the Egyptian and Israeli forces and supervise the ceasefire. It was withdrawn in May‚ÄìJune 1967, at Egypt's request.UNEF I. United Nations ==Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty== The refugees were told, that under the 1978 Camp David Accords, Israel and Egypt had agreed on the repatriation of them to the Gaza Strip within 6 months. Following the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979, which resulted from the Camp David Accords, Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1982. The Gaza‚ÄìEgypt border was redrawn, but only 8 families returned to Gaza without any compensation. In 1985, there were still 488 families in Canada Camp. However, funding problems, bureaucratic delays, lack of political will and difficult security conditions prolonged the process. ==Relocation Plan== It was not until 1989 that a mechanism for the return of these refugees to the Gaza Strip was established and, with pressure and financial support from the government of Canada and the Kuwaiti fund for Arab Economic Development, together with effort from the other players (namely UNRWA, Israel and the Palestinian Authority) refugees started moving across the border, mainly to the Tall as-Sultan district of Rafah. In September 1989, Egypt and Israel signed an \\"Agreed Plan for the Relocation of Canada District Inhabitants to the Region of the Gaza Strip\\". It stated \\"that the relocation shall be carried out solely on the basis of the free will of the inhabitants of the Canada District\\". As a result, only 20 households returned with $8,000, but without land. After the PLO had raised the compensation to $12,000 per household in 1991, 105 families returned to Gaza and in 1994 another 70. They received a plot of land in Tel el Sultan. The money was not enough to obtain a house, so everybody had to borrow. Israeli settlers in Gaza objected to the return of refugees and delivered in 1989 a rumour to the Jerusalem Post that since 1982 ‚Äútraining‚Äù had been given to people in Canada Camp and that the relocation would allow the entry of ‚Äú750 terrorists‚Äù into Gaza. After the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords, the Palestinian Authority became involved in the relocation process. It was not until 27 December 2000 that the last families were able to return. Canada also provided funds for the construction of a community centre in Tall as-Sultan for the benefit of the returning families. ==Daily life== Life for refugees in Canada Camp was particularly hard, as they were cut off from work in both Gaza and Israel, and unable to work in Egypt, in fact, they had to pay every six months to have their Egyptian visas renewed. Family and friends, unable to see each other due to the practical impossibility of gaining the necessary permits, could only communicate at the ‚Äúshouting fence‚Äù across the border strip. Higher education and proper health care were only available by paying fees much higher than most people could afford. For treatment of serious medical problems, Canada Camp residents would have to pay locally or travel to the Palestine Red Crescent Hospital in Cairo. Israel and Egypt disputed over the location where refugees could cross the border. Israel wanted them to use the Israel‚Äìcontrolled Rafah Terminal, Egypt insisted that the Salah al Din Gate in downtown Rafah (also known as the ‚Äúpishpash‚Äù gate) be used, as it was the only direct crossing between Egypt and Gaza without going through Israeli-controlled areas. ==See also== *Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development ==References *UNRWA Profile Rafah Camp Category:Palestinian refugee camps in the Gaza Strip Category:Palestine refugee camps Category:Populated places disestablished in 2000 Category:Sinai Peninsula ","title":"Canada Camp"},{"id":"20181354","text":"Hammes Company (or Hammes Co.) is a healthcare consulting firm, providing strategic planning, facility development and real estate advisory to the healthcare industry.

He is also known as a curator and organizer of art events. He lives and works in Berlin. ==Early lifeWorkshop of the Film Form (1970-1977)=== He was born in Nysa. As a child he took painting-classes planning to become a painter and wanting to study at the Art Academy in Krak√≥w. But instead of making his childhood dream come true, he made up his mind and went to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, where he studied cinematography at the Film School between 1970 and 1975. During that time he became a member of Workshop of the Film Form, one of the most important artistic groups in Poland in the 70s. Workshop was an avant-garde collective of painters, filmmakers, critics, poets, philosophers and scientists, working with experimental film and multimedia. Later on Ryszard Wasko became a lecturer in the departments of experimental media and photography at the Film School in Lodz. The members of the Workshop of the Film Form (1973) ===First accomplishments=== In the 70s he took part in the XII S√£o Paulo Art Biennial, documenta 6, the Third International Festival of Independent Avant-garde Film in London, the Sydney Biennale, the XI Biennale de Paris, the V Biennale of Spatial Forms among others. He also created the Archives of Contemporary Thought (1979), a forum for symposia and art events. ===Early works=== After dealing with experimental film and photography, Wasko started to develop his painting skills again. \\"Wasko discovered himself as an artist and learned how to cope with everyday life with a greater vision of the world than simply the provincial circumstances of life. \\"Robert C. Morgan, Ryszard Wasko: Bedtime Stories, The Brooklyn Rail, January, New York 2004 He left the Workshop of the Film Form and came to prominence as a conceptual artist. \\"After studying film-making at the Academy in Lodz in the late sixties, Wasko went on to become one of Poland's leading conceptualists, working as a pioneer in the media of video and photography. Much of this work focused on dense mathematical structures involving sequences of time and reality.\\" His artistic output should be actually seen as a connection of two main fields: photography&film; and painting. \\"(...) the character of Ryszard Wasko's work in general, as well as the character of his individual works, is often defined by inter-generic, inter-media relations. Those works set in motion a whole net of intertextual relations on the level of general structural and ontological determinants, and on the level of different types of perception and rules of interpretation. In other words, in order to grasp a work which belongs to a certain artistic genre in its specificity, one should refer to its non-specific features which are characteristic for another kind of art.\\"Ryszard Kluszczy≈Ñski, Trans-media Art. On the Art of Ryszard Wasko in: Ryszard Wasko, Galeria FF, Lodz 1995 (catalogue) ==Construction in Process (1981)== Construction in Process, poster from the exhibition held in Lodz \\"It is impossible (...) to separate his activities as an artist (as a maker of installations, as a creator of paintings and works on paper) from his other endeavors as a curator, organizer, teacher, writer, agitator (...).\\"Gregory Volk, Meal for the Rich and the Poor in: Ryszard Wasko. Selected works 1986-2000, The International Artists' Museum, Many H. Gallery, Tel Aviv (catalogue) In 1981 in Lodz, Wasko initiated and organized Construction in Process, a series of exhibitions featuring works of art created on site. \\"(...) it was an important, and in fact crucial, event in the Polish arts scene of that era.\\" Artists who were invited to participate in Construction in Process invite in turn, another group of participants, giving the project a dynamic, open character. \\" The event became a symbolic alternative to larger institutional art events, including high-powered state and corporate-sponsored biennials and market-driven art fairs.\\" The participating artists were Richard Serra, Sol LeWitt, Brian O'Doherty, Dennis Oppenheim, Lawrence Weiner, Richard Nonas and others. After the first event in 1981 The Solidarity Collection (which includes works by the artists created for that event) came into existence. \\"Wasko continued to produce international events into the nineties, including two additional projects in Lodz (1990 and 1993), one in Israel (1995), one in Australia (1997), and another,(...) in the small town of Bydgogosz in north central Poland (2000).\\" 2006, 25 years after the opening of the first exhibition, Wasko established the Construction in Process-Museum (also in Lodz). Unfortunately, a waterdamage forced him to close it down (2008) and to devolve the collection to the Muzeum Sztuki in Lodz. ==Exile (1983-1993)Artistic career abroad=== After Martial Law was brought on in Poland, Wasko decided to leave for Germany(1983). He received there a DAAD scholarship in Berlin among other residencies. In the 80s he improved as a painter. Besides numerous one-man-shows Wasko took part in several international exhitbitions e.g. at Centre Georges Pompidou, Kunsthalle Hamburg and the Venice Biennale (1991, 1999, 2001, 2007). At the same time he lectured extensively in Europe, including at Saint Martin's School of Art, Hochschule der K√ºnste in Berlin and Freie Kunstakademie in Essen. The Pollock-Krasner Foundation has awarded Ryszard Wasko three times (1988,1993,1998). ===The International Artists' Museum=== Wasko went to Poland in 1989 and founded The International Artists' Museum in Lodz. It had developed into a worldwide network of locally run art centers, linking artists and intellectuals from diverse backgrounds, locations, and disciplines. It was \\" (...) an on-going alternative space that shows the work of international artists.\\" The Museum has organized and sponsored over 60 major international events, exhibitions, meetings, panels, concerts, readings, and projects focusing on art, culture, borders, community, and identity. Due to political changes in the city government the building of the International Artist's Museum at Tylna Street 14 has been sold to a private Bank (1998). The artistic community was not able to gather the vast sum of money the city of Lodz wanted for the property. The beautiful sculpture garden has been destroyed by the new owners. Only the work of Sol LeWitt is still standing at its original place.\\"His paradoxical brand of conceptual humanism has always been toward developing a better world and more spiritually-oriented environment for artists in which they can produce work outside of marketing restrictions, and thus communicate ideas that will benefit common people.\\" Unfortunately, his ideas were never understood by the authorities. ===Growing up and experimentalizing=== \\"For many years, austere, yet gorgeous, works on paper have been a big part of Wasko's oeuvre.\\" The drawings brought him to artpieces on canvas. In that time Wasko acted mainly as a painter. He started working with different materials lik soot, was, fat, zinc, fire, and others. \\"(...) the most important modification was the use of different materials than before. (...) Wasko turned to the simplest, 'poor' means of natural origin.\\"Grzegorz Sztabi≈Ñski, The Berlin Period in Ryszard Wasko's Career, in Ryszard Wasko, Lodz ‚Äì Berlin; works 1971-1996, Museum of History of the City of Lodz, Lodz 2008 (catalogue) ==≈Å√≥d≈∫ (1993-2008) Curator, director, teacher === Between 1990 and 1992 Wasko became Program Director at the P.S.1 Museum and Institute of Contemporary Art (today called P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center) in New York City and in 1997 he was chosen President of the International Artists Forum (IKG). At the same time he still handled the International Artist's Museum in Lodz. That town became Wasko's new home for over 15 years. The Valand School of Fine Arts in G√∂teborg invited him to give lectures as a Professor for two semesters (2004‚Äì2005). His artwork has been shown mostly in Europe (e.g. Tate Modern Gallery) and the United States (e.g. The Museum of Modern Art in New York). ===Lodz Biennale=== In 2004 Wasko amplified a new idea: the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Biennale, to be the first international Biennale in Eastern Europe. === Exploring new territories === Being successful as a director and curator he managed also to work creatively as an artist. In the 90s he worked mostly with primary painting materials like soot. He explored also the field of performance (Meal for the Rich & Poor, 1993) and installation (Child Territories, 1996). Around 2000 Wasko made his turn back to film and photography, but one should not think, he is an artist, who jumps from media to media, from material to material. His is an intermedial artist: \\"Wasko's works are not limited to any of the artistic genres he uses because they easily cross the borders between them: And his individual realizations, even if they remain - due to the materials used and some general genre manifestations - within a certain kind of art, they still cannot be explained by referring to the characteristics of that branch of art which is realized in them. On the contrary, quite often the fundamental principles which make up the structure of the artefacts come from a different branch of art than the one in which the works were actually created and where we would be inclined to place them.\\" ==Back in Berlin (2008)== In 2007, together with his wife Maria Wasko, he decided to move back to Berlin. They live there since 2008. Recent solo exhibitions include a retrospection at the Museum of History of the City of Lodz (Ryszard Wasko, Lodz ‚Äì Berlin, works 1971-1996) in 2008 and at the Haus am L√ºtzowplatz in Berlin (Contemporary Portrait, Checkpoint Charlie Hypothetical) in 2009: \\"Ryszard Wasko zeigt in seiner gleichnamigen Malereiausstellung Bilder von Personen, die ihre Identit√§t verbergen.

He is, in fact, one of those figures who consistently shakes things up and pushes the borders of the possible, certainly with a sense of mission, but also with humor and verve. \\" ==Gallery== File:Chair I, 1971, photography, 104,5x137,5cm.jpgChair I (1971) photography File:Chair II, 1971, photography, 104,5x137,5cm.jpgChair II (1971) photography File:Four-dimensional photography II, 1972, photographic composition, 216x47cm.jpgFour-dimensional photography II (1972) photography File:Stills from 'Negation', 1973.jpgNegation (1973) stills from the film File:Wasko, stills from 'Event on pane', Remont Gallery, Warsaw, 1975.jpgEvent on pane (1975) happening at Remont Gallery, Warsaw, Poland File:Wasko, Discontinous Sculpture, 1985, acrylic on wood, 2,5x5,5m.jpgDiscontinuous Sculpture (1985) acrylic on wood File:Wasko, Hypothetical Checkpoint Charlie, 1987-88, acrylic on photo and white board, 40x60 each.jpgHypothetical Checkpoint Charlie (1988) acrylic on photo and board File:Wasko, Man in the Night (to Barnett Newman), 1988, soot and gold leaf on canvas, 120x160cm.jpgMan in the Night (1988) painting (soot, gold leaf, oil on canvas) dedicated to Barnett Newman File:Small Rose Garden, 1993, oil and pencil on canvas, 120x170cm.jpgSmall Rose Garden (1993) painting (oil and pencil on canvas) File:Wasko, Red Rock at Dawn, soot pigment canvas, 1994.jpgRed Rock at Dawn (1994) painting (soot and pigment on canvas) File:7 Paths of Roses, 1995, sand painting, Negev Desert Israel, 50x100m.jpg7 Paths of Roses (1995) sand painting Negev Desert, Israel work for Construction in Process V File:Small Rose Garden, 1997, 4000 plastic roses, International Artists Museum Lodz.jpgSmall Rose Garden (1997) installation with 4000 plastic roses at the Zacheta Gallery in Warsaw, Poland File:Small Rose Garden, 1997, plastic roses on steel plate, 50x70cm.jpgSmall Rose Garden (1997) plastic roses and pitch on steel plate File:Monid≈Ço dla Polski na XXI wiek, 2000, photography, 100x70cm.jpgMonid≈Ço dla Polski na XXI wiek (2000) digital photography on canvas Flower Power series File:Wasko, I am telling you a secret, 2004, digital photography, 78x114cm.jpgI am telling you a secret (2004) digital photography series File:Wasko, I am telling you a secret, 2004, photography, 78x114cm.jpgI am telling you a secret (2004) digital photography series File:Wasko, Marcel, albo sen z papugƒÖ, 2004, installation.jpgMarcel, or dream with parrot (2004) installation ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Biennale File:Wasko, TV Stories (series), 2006, oil on canvas, 140x192cm.jpgTV Stories (2006) oil on canvas series File:Wasko, TV Stories (series), 2007, oil on canvas, 140x192cm.jpgTV Stories (2006) oil on canvas series ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Ryszard Wasko, Lodz ‚Äì Berlin; works 1971-1996, Museum of History of the City of Lodz, Lodz 2008 (catalogue) * 1,2,3‚Ä¶Avant-Gardes Film / Art between experiment and archive, edited by ≈Å.

He graduated in French Literature at the University of Rome, where he currently teaches and researches. In 2000, he published the controversial critical essay on Marcel Proust, inflammatorily entitled \\"Proust antiebreo (Proust, Anti-Jew)\\". In 2005, he achieved notoriety with his first novel Con le peggiori intenzioni (translated as The Worst Intentions). Following general critical acclaim, and positive reviews on the Corriere della Sera (defining him the \\"new Proust\\"), his book became a bestseller in Italy (with 200,000 copies sold in a few months). For this book he won the Premio Campiello for best first novel. The book narrates the story of the Sonnino family spanning half a century, and especially the life of its youngest member, Daniel. Piperno's book attracted noticeable interest with the media, involving Piperno in a number of TV interviews and literary debates. His writing is described both as ironic and ironically self-referential, with a disenchanted view of society and life in general. His critics have emphasised Piperno's difficult storyline and its allegedly confused narration. He states his inspiration as coming from the great literature of the 19th century, as well as that of contemporary America. Besides Proust (naturally), he's been associated to Philip Roth. In 2012, Piperno won the Premio Strega, Italy's leading literary award, for his novel Inseparabili (2012). It traces the lives of two brothers, Philip and Samuel Pontecorvo, after the painful death of their father Leo Pontecorvo. It is a sequel of Persecuzione published in 2010. Piperno studied guitar and has a strong interest in music. Until 2005, when he reached success as a writer, he was part of the Roman rock-blues Random as the solo guitarist and singer. He's also a fan of soccer team Lazio. ==Bibliography== *Proust antiebreo (Proust, Anti-Jew), Franco Angeli Editore (Critical & Linguistic Series), 2000 *Con le peggiori intenzioni, Mondadori (Italian & Foreign Writers), 2005 ; Mondadori (Collana Oscar Bestseller), 2006 **The Worst Intentions (Europa Editions, 2007) *Il demone reazionario.

Evidently, however, Judaism as much as aristocratic descent possess such a force that they totally overwhelm the single individual. Swann and Saint-Loup cannot do anything against chromosome enslavement. This is why Swann's face, at the end of his life, becomes as tragic and emaciated as that of Shylock, and why Saint-Loup's backside enlarges so much that it almost overlaps the similarly illustrious one of uncle Charlus.\\" \\\\--(transl. from \\"A la recherche de Proust\\", in The Gay Si√®cle, Monthly Diary, January 2006, p. 40) *\\"What's the point of writing a book entitled All the Anti-Semitic Jews: From Otto Weininger to Phillip Roth, and including yourself implicitly in that rich list, when everyone knows that you are neither Jewish nor anti-Semitic but would like to be both?

He worked as a builder in Z√ºrich and Lausanne starting from 1788. He arrived to Vienna in 1790 and began his study of architecture, largely self-taught. In 1790‚Äì91 he studied at the Bauakademie of Vienna and Dresden, then, in 1791‚Äì92, spent several months in Berlin where he was exposed to Palladian architecture. Carl Gotthard Langhans (1732‚Äì1808), David Gilly (1748‚Äì1808) and Hans Christian Genelli (1763‚Äì1823) were influential in the formation of Weinbrenner's architectural thought. He spent the years 1792 to 1797 in Italy, where he was part of the circle around Carl Ludwig Fernow (1763‚Äì1808) in Rome. His study of the ancient buildings of Rome, Pompeii, Herculaneum and, especially, Paestum were foundational to his later work. He was among the first German architects to see the early Doric buildings at Paestum.Brownlee, David B., Friedrich Weinbrenner, Architect of Karlsruhe, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1986, Chapter 1 == Career == Karlsruhe Protestant Church, 1807‚Äì16 Karlsruhe Catholic Church, 1808‚Äì14 Karlsruhe Mint, built 1826‚Äì27 Upon returning from Italy, Weinbrenner worked briefly in Strasbourg and Hanover, but established himself in Karlsruhe, where he would make his career as the official architect, working for both government and private clients. Karlsruhe was established in 1715 to replace a former capital and become the capital of the newly created Grand Duchy of Baden ‚Äì now a central German state but then a sovereign principality. A generation of architects were trained under his supervision, and in 1825 he helped establish the Polytechnic School in Karlsruhe. With the architects he trained and the publication of his work, a \\"Weinbrenner style\\" of Classicism developed. Weinbrenner is, of course, the architect principally responsible for creating Karlsruhe as a Classical city and, beginning with his 1797 General Plan, for the development of the city plan with an official Protestant church (Stadtkirche) (1807‚Äì15), City Hall (1821‚Äì25) on the Triumphal Road leading to the Princely palace.

It stars Michael Caton, Anne Tenney, Stephen Curry, Anthony Simcoe, Sophie Lee and Wayne Hope as the Kerrigan Family, as well as Tiriel Mora, Robyn Nevin, Eric Bana, Costas Kilias and Charles 'Bud' Tingwell. The screenwriting team consisted of Rob Sitch, Santo Cilauro, Tom Gleisner and Jane Kennedy of Working Dog Productions, all of whom were veteran writers and performers on ABC's The Late Show and The D-Generation. The Castle was filmed in 11 days on a budget of approximately . The film gained widespread acclaim in Australia and New Zealand, but was not widely distributed globally. It grossed A$10,326,428 at the box office in Australia. The film's title is based upon the English saying, repeatedly referred to in the film, \\"a man's home is his castle\\". Its humour plays on the national self-image, most notably the concept of working-class Australians and their place in modern Australia. ==Plot== The Kerrigan home, in the outer Melbourne blue-collar suburb of Coolaroo, is filled with love as well as pride in their modest lifestyle, but their happiness is threatened when developers attempt the compulsory acquisition of their house to expand the neighbouring airport. The Kerrigan house is built in a largely undeveloped housing tract, on a toxic landfill, and directly adjacent to an airport runway. Despite all this, sweet-natured family patriarch Darryl (Michael Caton) believes that he lives in the lap of luxury. Blissfully unaware of his family's lack of style or sophistication, he busies himself by driving a tow truck, racing greyhounds, and constantly adding tacky renovations to the house. The rest of the Kerrigan clan shares and supports his enthusiasm in every way. One day, a property valuer arrives to inspect the house. Though he has no wish to sell, Darryl points out all the features of the property, believing they will add value to the appraisal. A few weeks later, he receives a letter informing him of the compulsory acquisition of his house for the sum of $70,000. His neighbours (elderly Jack, divorcee Yvonne, and Farouk and Tabulah, recent immigrants from Lebanon) all receive similar notices. Believing on common principle that the government cannot evict him unwillingly from his treasured home, Darryl attempts to fight the eviction. Agents from the airport try to bribe and bully the family into giving up, but their actions only stiffen the Kerrigans' resolve. Darryl hires an incompetent lawyer acquaintance, Dennis Denuto (Tiriel Mora), but Dennis's meagre argument that the eviction goes against \\"the vibe\\" of the Constitution does not go well in court. While awaiting the court's final decision, Darryl makes pleasant small talk with a man whom he meets outside the courthouse, Lawrence Hammill (Bud Tingwell), who has come to watch his son (a barrister) perform in court. The court rejects the family's appeal and gives them two weeks to vacate. The purchase price for the home is scarcely enough to cover a small apartment. Dejected in defeat, the family begins to pack. A new breath of hope comes with the surprise arrival of Lawrence, who reveals himself to be a retired Queen's Counsel. Lawrence has taken an interest in the Kerrigans' case, in part due to his extensive experience in constitutional law, and offers to argue before the High Court of Australia on their behalf, gratis. Lawrence makes a persuasive case that the Kerrigans have the right to just terms of compensation for acquisition of property under Section 51(xxxi) of the Australian Constitution. He closes by paraphrasing Darryl's own comments that his house is more than just a structure of bricks and mortar, but a home built with love and shared memories. The court rules in favour of the Kerrigans, and their case becomes a landmark precedent on the subject. An epilogue shows that the Kerrigans continue to prosper happily, and Lawrence becomes a lasting friend of the family. ==Cast== * Michael Caton as Darryl Kerrigan, the father * Anne Tenney as Sal Kerrigan, the mother * Stephen Curry as Dale Kerrigan, the youngest son, digger of holes, and narrator of the film * Sophie Lee as Tracey Petropoulous (n√©e Kerrigan), the family's only daughter, a newlywed hair dresser * Eric Bana as Con Petropoulous, Tracey's new husband, an accountant and amateur kickboxer * Anthony Simcoe as Steve Kerrigan, the second oldest son and an apprentice mechanic * Wayne Hope as Wayne Kerrigan, the black sheep, who is serving time for armed robbery but is loved by his family regardless * Tiriel Mora as Dennis Denuto, a bumbling small-time lawyer who previously failed to defend Wayne on his charge * Costas Kilias as Farouk, the Kerrigans' neighbour * Charles 'Bud' Tingwell as Lawrence Hammill QC, a retired barrister who comes to the Kerrigans' aid by representing them pro bono * John Flaus as Sgt. Kennedy, a local police officer * Tony Martin as Adam Hammill, Lawrence's son (brief, mostly non-speaking cameo) * Larry Emdur appears as himself (in 1997 he was host of the Australian version of Price is Right) * Ian Ross appears as himself (in 1997 he was a Channel Nine newsreader) ==Legal principles== The film refers to the land rights movement of Aboriginal Australians, with Darryl Kerrigan drawing an explicit parallel between his struggle and theirs. It also draws on one of the few rights protected in the Australian Constitution for subject matter, the right to just terms compensation for acquisition of property under s51(xxxi). Also interspersed in the film are many references to famous Australian Constitutional Law Cases, such as Mabo and the Tasmanian Dams Case. The film also deals with section 109 of the Constitution which provides that in the case of an inconsistency between Federal and State law, the Federal law shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. For the purpose of the drama, some of the relevant legal principles are simplified. For example, the law relating to compulsory acquisition can be complicated and raises more questions than are noted in the film. Section 51 (xxxi) of the Commonwealth Constitution applies to acquisitions only by the Commonwealth, not by the States, and the latter are more likely to compulsorily acquire property. Similarly, in contrast to Kerrigan's idea that the value he places on his own home cannot be bought, the law regularly places a monetary value on intangible human values. ==Production== According to Santo Cilauro, the film took five weeks from original inception to final cut. The movie was written in two weeks, shot in ten days and taken to rough cut in two weeks.Interview with Santo Cilauro, Signit, 6 February 1997 accessed 14 October 2012Peter Malone, \\"A House is a Castle\\", Cinema Papers, April 1997 p10-12 The Castle was filmed mostly in Melbourne, Victoria. The external shots of the Kerrigan household were shot at 3 Dagonet St, Strathmore, and airport footage was shot at Essendon Airport and Melbourne Airport. Location shots of Brunswick feature in the film, including Brunswick Town Hall and Rocky Porcino Pharmacy at 720 Sydney Rd (Dennis's office). Melbourne's 200 Queen Street and the Supreme Court of Victoria are featured along with the High Court of Australia in Canberra. Some of the film is set in Bonnie Doon, and a very small portion of it was shot there. The name Kerrigan was chosen for the family so that tow trucks for the film could be borrowed from an existing Melbourne tow-truck company with that name. The company still operates today. In January 2011, 3491 Maintongoon Road, Bonnie Doon was listed for sale. The property appeared in the film as the Kerrigan family holiday house. The property's real estate agent reported that many people called and after requesting the vendor's asking price, replied with a quote from the movie: \\"Tell him he's dreamin'.\\" ==Alternative versions== In the US version, there were several minor changes to dialogue. \\"Rissole\\" was changed to \\"meatloaf\\", \\"two-stroke\\" was changed to \\"diesel\\", references to the Australian TV show Hey Hey It's Saturday were changed to the more generic Funniest Home Videos (which existed in both markets), and the brand names of the various cars in the driveway were changed from uniquely Australian cars like the Camira, to ones sold in both countries like the Corolla.R4 vs R1 DVD Comparison (scroll down to the section \\"R4 vs R1\\") The Australian TV version for \\"before-8:30pm screening\\" has scenes of explicit language either completely cut or, where possible, masked by aircraft noises or redubbed when lip movements are not visible. When broadcast after 8:30pm, all explicit language is intact. ==Box office== The Castle grossed A$10,326,428 at the box office in Australia, over 13 times its A$750,000 budget. US rights were bought by Miramax for a rumoured $6 million.Tearlach Hutchenson, \\"The Castle\\", Cinema Papers, August/September 2000 p10-14 ==Critical reception== The Castle received positive reviews from critics. It has an 87% approval rating from review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 39 reviews, with a weighted average of 6.99/10. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it \\"one of those comic treasures like The Full Monty and Waking Ned Devine that shows its characters in the full bloom of glorious eccentricity\\". In its home country of Australia, the film was even better received, is considered an iconic classic and is frequently listed as one of the greatest Australian films ever made. Elsewhere around the world, especially in non- English-speaking countries not familiar with Australian humour, mores or issues, the film made little impact. In 2011, Time Out London named it the 25th-greatest comedy film of all time. ==Themes== The Castle can be seen as a social study on the lives and aspirations of the inhabitants of suburban Australia. The central character, Darryl Kerrigan, ties into the stereotypical depiction of an \\"Aussie battler\\", a man who will protect and serve his family through bold and sometimes ruthless assertion. The Aussie battler will at times face challenges or adversity, often in the face of oppressive government or economic hardship. Kerrigan, and to a lesser extent his wife and children, are committed to their pursuit of the Australian Dream, a concept considered somewhat outdated. The Castle, like many other Australian television shows and films, portrays the average Australian as \\"un-cultured\\" or ignorant of culture beyond what is filtered down through the masses (on mainstream television or in tabloid journalism), and to a lesser extent the restrictions failing to explore a city beyond one's suburbs impose on families as far as exposure to arts or entertainment. ==Awards== {  - !

Originally the park contained an 18-hole golf course which was reduced to 9 holes in the mid-1970s in order to construct the Montreal Olympic Park. Maisonneuve Park borders partially on Sherbrooke Street East. It is named in honour of Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve, founder of Montreal. The park is a unique place where people enjoy walking day or night, bicycling on its bike trail which runs all the way around the park. The center of the park is a calm area where people enjoy picnics and tranquility and is very popular among young people and families. The loop section of the bicycle path is long. This does not include the path outside the fenced area, along Sherbrooke St. It has been the site for Montreal's annual F√™te nationale du Qu√©bec concert on June 24, but in 2015 the festivities were held in the Place des Festivals instead. == References  External links == *Montreal Parks Web site *Montreal.com Web site Category:Parks in Montreal Category:Golf clubs and courses in Quebec Category:Rosemont‚ÄìLa Petite-Patrie ","title":"Maisonneuve Park"},{"id":"20181826","text":"Johnston Hastings \\"Jack\\" Skelly Jr. (1841‚Äì1863) was a Union soldier ‚Äî a corporal in the 87th Pennsylvania Infantry ‚Äî who died as a result of wounds sustained at the Second Battle of Winchester.

It is one of several bacteria that is normally present in the mouth and upper part of the respiratory tract such as nose and throat. However, it may also rarely cause endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. ==Microbiology== C. hominis is a catalase-negative, oxidase-positive, indole-producing, Gram-negative rod. Its morphology has classically been described as highly pleomorphic and irregularly staining, although homogeneous bacilli with uniform shapes may be seen with the addition of yeast extract. ==Antibiotic sensitivity== Historically, C. hominis has been sensitive to penicillin and penicillin derivatives such as ampicillin. However, penicillin-resistant strains, including those that produce beta-lactamases, have been described with increasing frequency. Clinical guidelines thus recommend that C. hominis and other HACEK organisms be presumed to harbor ampicillin resistance and therefore be treated with a third-generation cephalosporin. C. hominis and other HACEK organisms also exhibit in vitro susceptibility to trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole, fluoroquinolones, and aztreonam. C. hominis is often resistant to erythromycin. Since cefotaxime use may be not appropriate for C. hominis endocarditis, an alternative regimen might include association of co- amoxiclav and gentamicin. ==References * Image: Cardibacterium hominins *Type strain of Cardiobacterium hominis at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Gram-negative bacteria Category:Gammaproteobacteria ","title":"Cardiobacterium hominis"},{"id":"20181872","text":"Kazuhiro Furuhashi at Anime Expo 2013 is a Japanese anime director and supervisor, born in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka Prefecture.

Among his professional achievements, he served 12 years as chairman of the congressionally legislated Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPac) formed to advise Congress and the administration on the functioning of the Medicare Diagnostic Related Group (DRG) Hospital Payment System and other system reforms. He is also chair of the Health Industry Forum which brings together diverse group leaders from across the health care field to develop solutions for critical problems facing the healthcare system. From 1997 to 1999, he served on President Bill Clinton's National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, a 14-member commission tasked with providing the president with recommendations to help Medicare remain tenable. Stuart is co-author of a book on the history of healthcare in the United States, Policies for an Aging Society. The book records information gathered from experts in public and health policy, economics, law, and management to identify the salient issues and explore realistic options. From positions ranging from liberal to conservative, the contributors take a wide view of the philosophical, economic, and programmatic aspects of the social protection programs for elderly Americans. They ask broad questions and propose integrated conceptions of how our society can best provide for the needs of its aging population. Altman co-authored another book with David Shactman titled Power, Politics, and Universal Health Care (2011), in which the history of healthcare in the United States during the 20th century and into the 21st is explained, ultimately putting Obama's healthcare plan into historical perspective. He is the older brother of Edward Altman & Ellen Altman-Stein. == References  * Biography at Brandeis University * Category:Brandeis University faculty Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:American economists Category:Health economists Category:Presidents of Brandeis University ","title":"Stuart Altman"},{"id":"20181950","text":"The Eternal derby (), also called the Romanian derby () or the Great derby (), is a football match between Bucharest rivals FCSB and Dinamo Bucure»ôti.

It is formed of a vast semi-circular basin over 16 km wide and 20 km from its entrance to the opposite shore. Although half closed off to the west by cap de la Ch√®vre, it opens out again to a width of 9 km on the side of the mer d'Iroise. To the south-east is the port of Douarnenez, which was the center of a large sardine industry in the early 20th century. The bay was named after it. Dourarnenez is the only settlement of importance on the banks of the bay. The bathing station at Morgat is located to the north, on the Crozon peninsula. The mythical town of Ys, which legend says was engulfed by the ocean, is commonly said to be located in this bay.

Canadian historical files relating to participation in the tests cite in particular three previous series of tests leading up to those conducted in Operation LAC.Department of National Defence (Canada), Biological Warfare * September 1950 ‚Äì Six simulated attacks were conducted upon the San Francisco Bay Area. It was concluded that it was feasible to attack a seaport city with biological aerosol agents from a ship offshore. * March‚ÄìApril 1952 ‚Äì Five trials were conducted off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia under Operation Dew. It was concluded that long-range aerosol clouds could obtain hundreds of miles of travel and large-area coverage when disseminated from ground level under certain meteorological conditions. * 1957 ‚Äì North Sea, East coast of Britain. It was shown that large-area coverage with particles was feasible under most meteorological conditions. In addition, the army admitted to spraying in Minnesota locations from 1953 into the mid-1960s. In St. Louis in the mid 1950s, and again a decade later, the army sprayed zinc cadmium sulfide via motorized blowers atop Pruitt-Igoe, at schools, from the backs of station wagons, and via planes.\\"The Army Sprayed St. Louis With Toxic Aerosol During A Just Revealed 1950s Test\\" ==Operation== Operation LAC was undertaken in 1957 and 1958 by the U.S. Army Chemical Corps.Guillemin, Jeanne. Biological Weapons: From the Invention of State-Sponsored Programs to Contemporary Bioterrorism, ( Internet Archive), Columbia University Press, 2005, p. 108, (). The operation involved spraying large areas with zinc cadmium sulfide. The U.S. Air Force loaned the Army a C-119, \\"Flying Boxcar\\", and it was used to disperse the materials by the ton in the atmosphere over the United States. The first test occurred on December 2, 1957, along a path from South Dakota to International Falls, Minnesota. The tests were designed to determine the dispersion and geographic range of biological or chemical agents. Stations on the ground tracked the fluorescent zinc cadmium sulfide particles. During the first test and subsequently, much of the material dispersed ended up being carried by winds into Canada. However, as was the case in the first test, particles were detected up to 1,200 miles away from their drop point.Novick, Lloyd F. and Marr, John S. Public Health Issues Disaster Preparedness: Focus on Bioterrorism, (Google Books), Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2003, p. 89, ().Cole, Leonard A., The Eleventh Plague, (Google Books), Macmillan, 2002, pp. 19-23, (). A typical flight line covering 400 miles would release 5,000 pounds of zinc cadmium sulfide and in fiscal year 1958 around 100 hours were spent in flight for LAC. That flight time included four runs of various lengths, one of which was 1,400 miles. ==Specific tests== The December 2, 1957, test was incomplete due to a mass of cold air coming south from Canada. It carried the particles from their drop point and then took a turn northeast, taking most of the particles into Canada with it. Military operators considered the test a partial success because some of the particles were detected 1,200 miles away, at a station in New York state. A February 1958 test at Dugway Proving Ground ended similarly. Another Canadian air mass swept through and carried the particles into the Gulf of Mexico. Two other tests, one along a path from Toledo, Ohio, to Abilene, Texas, and another from Detroit, to Springfield, Illinois, to Goodland, Kansas, showed that agents dispersed through this aerial method could achieve widespread coverage when particles were detected on both sides of the flight paths. ==Scope== According to Leonard A. Cole, an Army Chemical Corps document titled \\"Summary of Major Events and Problems\\" described the scope of Operation LAC.\\"Summary of Major Events and Problems\\" (1958), p. 108‚Äì110 Cole stated that the document outlined that the tests were the largest ever undertaken by the Chemical Corps and that the test area stretched from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean, and from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Other sources describe the scope of LAC varyingly; examples include, \\"Midwestern United States\\", and \\"the states east of the Rockies\\". Specific locations are mentioned as well. Some of those include: a path from South Dakota to Minneapolis, Minnesota,Dugway Proving Ground, Corpus Christi, Texas, north-central Texas, and the San Francisco Bay area.LeBaron, Wayne. America's Nuclear Legacy, (Google Books), Nova Publishers, 1998, p. 83‚Äì84, (). ==Risks and issues== Bacillus globigii was used to simulate biological warfare agents (such as anthrax), because it was then considered a contaminant with little health consequence to humans; however, BG is now considered a human pathogen. Anecdotal evidence exists of ZnCdS causing adverse health effects as a result of LAC. However, a U.S. government study, done by the U.S. National Research Council, stated, in part, \\"After an exhaustive, independent review requested by Congress, we have found no evidence that exposure to zinc cadmium sulfide at these levels could cause people to become sick.\\"Leary, Warren E. \\" Secret Army Chemical Tests Did Not Harm Health, Report Says, The New York Times, May 15, 1997, accessed November 13, 2008. Still, the use of ZnCdS remains controversial and one critic accused the Army of \\"literally using the country as an experimental laboratory\\".Moreno, Jonathan D.

It says an employer can \\"differentiate upon the basis of sex\\" when it compensates employees \\"if such differentiation is authorized by\\" the Equal Pay Act. The Bennett Amendment has been criticized for its poor drafting, and lack of discussion in Congress.G Rutherglen, Employment Discrimination Law: Visions of Equality in Theory and Doctrine (3rd edn 2010) 122-123, \\"Read literally, the Bennett Amendment is therefore wrong on two counts: the Equal Pay Act does not \\"authorize\\" any differences in pay and it does not explicitly allow any differences in pay \\"on the basis of sex.\\" It has also invited debate on the extent to which it impacts the question of \\"comparable worth\\", including whether or not lawsuits may be brought when jobs are different, but judged by contrast on an importance continuum to jobs of higher pay. In 1981 the Supreme Court of the United States determined in County of Washington v. Gunther that the Bennett Amendment explicitly incorporated only limited defenses to unequal pay and did not otherwise bar suits based on a comparison of payment for different jobs. Nevertheless, it has continued to be used to bar comparable worth suits in lower courts. ==Background== While Title VII forbids employers to discriminate against employees on the basis of sex, the Bennett Amendment (proposed as Public Law 88-38 on June 10, 1963) provides exception, specifically noting that:Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Retrieved 2008-10-12. > It shall not be an unlawful employment practice under this subchapter for > any employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex in determining the > amount of the wages or compensation paid or to be paid to employees of such > employer if such differentiation is authorized by the provisions of section > 206(d) of title 29 [section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as > amended]. ¬ß206(d) of the Equal Pay Act allows differentiation of payment on (1) seniority, (2) merit, (3) productivity, or (4) any other factor than sex. According to 2004's Employee Benefits Law, the Amendment was proposed by Wallace F. Bennett, a Republican Senator from Utah as a \\"'technical' amendment\\" to bring the Civil Rights Act and the Equal Pay Act into accord. ==Comparable worth debate== Arthur Gutman in 1999's EEO Law and Personnel Practices describes comparable worth as a system of ranking jobs on \\"a continuum of value to the company\\", allowing, e.g., that while one job may be worth $10 an hour, a job of slightly less complexity might be worth $8.Gutman, 85. Evaluating this continuum provides an \\"internal worth\\", indicative of the value of the job to a particular company, which may be compared to an \\"external worth\\", or the value of a job to the wider market. The impact of the Bennett Amendment on the comparable worth debate has been a point of contention. In 1989, Ellen Frankel Paul summarized the matter in Equity and Gender: The Comparable Worth Debate, by posing two questions: \\"Does the Bennett Amendment plug into Title VII all of the Equal Pay Act's standards, thus importing the \\"equal work\\" standard of the latter? Or does it merely inject the Equal Pay Act's four exceptions...?\\"Paul, 67. Paul notes that the question is pivotal to resolving the Comparable Worth Debate, for if it is interpreted to incorporate the entirety of the Equal Pay Act's standards, then it becomes impossible to prove a \\"comparable worth\\" suit, defining two different jobs in a scale of importance and determining by it how to judge equal pay.Paul, 68. ===County of Washington v. Gunther=== The Supreme Court of the United States first examined the question of the impact of the Bennett Amendment in the 1981 case County of Washington v. Gunther, 452 U.S. 161. The case originated in 1974 in Oregon when a group of four female county prison guards sued the County of Washington for unequal wages, alleging that their pay was less than that of male guards for no reason other than sexual discrimination. The district court disagreed, finding that male guards were responsible for overseeing more prisoners and also that female guards spent some of their time in clerical tasks, but also found as a matter of law that a sex-based wage discrimination claim cannot be brought under Title VII unless it satisfies the equal work standard of the Equal Pay Act of 1963.Brennan. While not reviewing the first finding, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held with respect to the latter that \\"claims for sex-based wage discrimination can also be brought under Title VII even though no member of the opposite sex holds an equal but higher paying job, provided that the challenged wage rate is not exempted under the Equal Pay Act's affirmative defenses as to wage differentials attributable to seniority, merit, quantity or quality of production, or any other factor other than sex.\\" It interpreted the intention of the Amendment as incorporating \\"into Title VII only the affirmative defenses of the Equal Pay Act, not its prohibitory language requiring equal pay for equal work.\\" With this finding, by a narrow margin, the US Supreme Court concurred.McCann, 36 Justice Brennan, speaking for the Court, indicated that the Bennett Amendment did not preclude comparison of differences in pay, but only those attributable to those four specific factors. Gunther, however, did not prove as definitive on the question as first believed, both because it did not address all factors under consideration and because it was a narrow decision.McCann, 37. The Court did not determine how jobs might be properly compared, and one of the primary opponents of the majority opinion was the soon-to-be Chief Justice of the United States William Rehnquist. Rehnquist wrote explicitly against the comparable worth theory in his dissent (speaking as well for Warren E. Burger, Lewis F. Powell, Jr. and Potter Stewart), while Brennan countered that the majority opinion was not explicitly or implicitly supporting or refuting the comparable worth doctrine. Gutman underscored that \\"the Gunther ruling did not validate comparable worth theory; it merely permitted plaintiffs to try to make the prima facie claim under Title VII rules\\" and added that \\"[s]o far plaintiffs have been thwarted in every case.\\"Gutman, 187. ==See also== *US labor law *Schultz v.

His uncle, Diogo de Campos Moreno says that \\"he was sent very young with P√™ro Coelho de Sousa, so that while serving in that expedition he could learn the language of the Indians, and their customs, devoting himself to them, and making himself very familiar, and a relative or friend to them, as they say.\\" He participated in the P√™ro Coelho expedition to Cear√° in 1603 and ended up becoming, years later (1612), the virtual founder of that colony. There he built, on the river Cear√°, a fort and a chapel, with the help of the Indians that he brought from Rio Grande do Norte. That same year, on the orders of Jer√≥nimo de Albuquerque Maranh√£o, he reconnoitered Maranh√£o, occupied by the French, who had stirred up the people of that land. On his return, however, his ship was driven by the wind to the Antilles. In 1614 he was in Seville, in Spain. The next year, now a captain, he returned to Maranh√£o, together with reinforcements of 900 men, which made possible the definitive expulsion of the French and the capture of the city of S√£o Lu√≠s. In 1616 he was captured on the high seas by a French Corsair, after a violent battle that left him seriously wounded with a cut on the face and the loss of a hand. The charter letter of May 26, 1619 made him lord of the captaincy of Cear√°, in thanks for his services. There, in 1624 and 1625, he repelled the attacks of two Dutch ships. In 1630 he dedicated himself to fighting the Dutch invasion of Pernambuco. He left Cear√° with a few Indians and soldiers and arrived at the Arraial do Bom Jesus in June 1631. In the initial phase of the fight, he took part in the blockade of the Dutch forces in Recife and Olinda. He always distinguished himself, as a combatant and interpreter with the Indians. In subsequent years he took part in the defense of Para√≠ba and of Cunha√∫ (in Rio Grande do Norte). The Dutch having defeated the Portuguese colonial resistance, and the Portuguese Monarchy having been restored in 1640, a truce was signed between Portugal and the Netherlands. Nevertheless, in 1645, Martim Soares Moreno took part in the clandestine movement that ended with the expulsion of the Dutch from Brazilian territory. ==In culture== His life served as the historical basis for Jos√© de Alencar's novel Iracema.

It was established by an Act of the Scottish Parliament and started its work in 2008. The Commission is independent of Government, and of the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments. It seeks to promote and protect the human rights of everyone in Scotland, working to increase awareness, recognition and respect for human rights, and make them more relevant and easier to apply in everyday life. The Commission aims to help everyone understand their rights and the shared responsibilities everyone has to each other and to their community. The SHRC has an office in Edinburgh. It is a Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) supported body meaning that it is separate and independent from Government but still accountable for its public funds. The chair of the Commission is Judith Robertson. The Scottish Human Rights Commission is the newest of the three national human rights institutions (NHRIs) in the United Kingdom and, like the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), it has secured \\"A status\\" accreditation from the International Co-ordinating Committee of NHRIs (the ICC). The Scottish Parliament, when establishing the Commission in 2008, ensured that it complied with United Nations Principles Related to the Status of National Institutions, known as the Paris Principles ‚Äì a series of recommendations on the role, status and functions of NHRIs. The Commission has a strong international profile and can participate in parallel reporting mechanisms for UN treaty processes. In October 2010 it hosted the biennial world conference of NHRIs in Edinburgh. The Commission was elected as chair of the European Group of National Human Rights Institutions during a meeting in Geneva on 17 May 2011, and re-elected to this post in May 2013 ==Mandate== * To promote and protect the human rights ‚Äì civil, political, economic, social and cultural ‚Äì of everyone in Scotland. * To promote best practice on human rights in Scotland by providing education, advice and training. * To publish information and conduct research. The Commission must lay annually before the Scottish Parliament a general report on the exercise of its functions during the year. Issues concerning equality, and some non-devolved human rights matters, are the responsibility of the EHRC. The SHRC, NIHRC and EHRC participate with the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland in the \\"independent mechanism\\" to promote, protect and monitor implementation in the UK of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. ==Powers== The Scottish Commission was established by the Scottish Commission for Human Rights Act 2006, an Act of the Scottish Parliament. The legislation sets out: * The power to conduct inquiries into the policies or practices of Scottish public authorities working to deliver a particular service, or public authorities of a particular description. * The ability to provide education, training and awareness raising, and by publishing research. * Recommending such changes to Scottish law, policy and practice as it considers necessary. * The power to enter some places of detention as part of an inquiry, and the power to intervene in civil court cases where relevant to the promotion of human right and where the case appears to raise a matter of public interest. The Commission is under a duty to ensure it is not duplicating work that others already carry out. It cannot provide assistance to any person in connection with a legal claim. Assistance includes advice, guidance and grants. ==Commissioners== The current chair of the Commission is Judith Robertson, who was appointed in February 2016. There are also three part-time Commissioners. * Matt Smith OBE * Susan Kemp * Dr Alan Mitchell Matt Smith was appointed in 2011 and will finish his six-year term in August 2017. Susan Kemp and Alan Mitchell were appointed in 2015. ==Previous chairs and commissioners== Professor Alan Miller served as chair from 2008 to 2016. Previous commissioners: * John McNeill (2008-09) * Professor Kay Hampton (2008-15) * Shelagh McCall (2008-15) ==Work of the Commission== The Commission is currently working from its Strategic Plan 2017-2020. The strategic priorities for this time period are as follows: 1\\\\. Building a human rights culture - SNAP (Scotland's National Action Plan) and beyond 2\\\\. Promoting respect for dignity and rights in health and social care 3\\\\. Promoting a rights based approach to poverty and social justice 4\\\\. Increasing accountability for rights: law, regulation, monitoring, and accessing rights 5\\\\. Learning, sharing and promoting our work and human rights internationally and nationally The work of the Commission focuses on implementing a human-rights‚Äìbased approach at the heart of policy choices and practice in Scotland to ensure that human rights are at the centre of how organisations in Scotland work, as well as how they measure success. ===Scotland's National Action Plan for Human Rights (SNAP)=== Scotland‚Äôs National Action Plan for Human Rights (SNAP) was launched on International Human Rights Day, 10 December 2013. It sets out a bold roadmap towards a Scotland where everyone can live with human dignity. ===Care About Rights=== This project aims to increase awareness, understanding and confidence in the care sector about human rights in order to improve conditions for those in care and for their carers. Particular emphasis has been placed on the needs of older people through a training package called \\"Care about Rights\\". ===Acknowledgement and Accountability Forum for victims of Historic Child Abuse=== In February 2010 the Commission published a comprehensive human rights framework to address historic child abuse through an Acknowledgement and Accountability Forum. The framework was positively received by many survivors and international experts. The Commission worked with the Centre for Excellence for Looked After Children in Scotland to deliver a series of InterActions with to develop an Action Plan on Justice and Remedies. You can read more about the InterActions here: [www.shrcinteraction.org] The Commission continues to monitor the process of acknowledgement and accountability in Scotland and the implementation of its recommendations. Current work on historic child abuse can be seen at the Commission's website: [www.scottishhumanrights.com/justice/historic-child-abuse/] ===Human Rights Impact Assessments for Education and Training=== In order to fulfil its mandate concerning education and training the Commission has developed training materials on human rights for staff in local authorities. In January 2010 the Commission piloted human rights training for staff within the Services for Communities Division of the City of Edinburgh Council. In the following month research was also conducted into international best practice and various experiences of carrying out human rights impact assessments. In 2013 the Commission piloted a joint Equalities and Human Rights Impact Assessment with two partner organisations, Fife and Renfrewshire Councils. The project will begin by establishing an understanding of current practices and approaches to assessing equality and human rights impacts, and develop appropriate means for the partner organisations to move beyond the legal requirement to carry out equality impact assessment towards having the capability to assess equality and human rights impacts together. The pilot bodies will contribute to the development of ideas and also to the road- testing of such approaches. ==Emerging human rights issuesBusiness and human rights=== In 2010 the Commission contributed to the work of the Working Group of the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions on Business and Human Rights by drafting a survey for all institutions on their interests, needs and capacities in the area. The Commission also provided written and oral evidence to the UK Parliament Joint Committee on Human Rights inquiry on Business and Human Rights. In October 2010 the Commission hosted the International Conference of National Human Rights Institutions on the theme of Business and Human Rights. The conference agreed the Edinburgh Declaration, which sets an action plan for NHRIs on business and human rights. ===Defending the Human Rights Act=== In 2009, the Conservative party, then the main UK opposition party, announced that, if elected, it would repeal the Human Rights Act 1998 and replace it with a Bill of Rights. In March 2010 the Commission published two statements, including one co-signed with the NIHRC, calling for the preservation of the Act and emphasising that human rights would be best protected by building on the Act instead of replacing it. ===Human rights and climate change=== In November 2009 the Commission, in conjunction with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Scottish Government and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers, held a conference in Glasgow on 'Human Rights and Climate Change, Achieving climate justice in Scotland'. ==International activities== The Commission is one of over 80 NHRIs within the ICC's global network supported by the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. In June 2010 the Commission was given \\"A status\\" accreditation by the ICC; this gives it enhanced access to treaty bodies and other UN mechanisms. Along with the NIHRC and EHRC the SHRC participates in the European Group of NHRIs. The SHRC is currently the chair of the European Group. ===Interaction with other NHRIs=== In June 2009 the Commission hosted the first joint meeting of the four national human rights institutions of the UK and Ireland; the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the Irish Human Rights Commission, the NIHRC and, of course, the Scottish Commission. Justice Albie Sachs, a former justice of the South African Constitutional Court, also participated in the meeting. In October 2010 the Commission hosted the 10th International Conference of National Human Rights Institutions at the Scottish Parliament, bringing together delegates from over 80 countries to discuss issues around Business and Human Rights. The conference ended with the agreement of the Edinburgh Declaration. ===Interaction with the United Nations=== The Commission frequently makes submissions to the Treaty bodies of the United Nations framework. The reports provide a critique of law, policy and practice in Scotland. In June 2009 the Commission was appointed a member of the UK's independent mechanism responsible for promoting, monitoring and protecting the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. ==References * SHRC website * Equality and Human Rights Commission * Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission Category:National human rights institutions Category:Human rights organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Scottish commissions and inquiries Category:2008 establishments in Scotland Category:Government agencies established in 2008 Category:Human rights in Scotland Category:Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body ","title":"Scottish Human Rights Commission"},{"id":"20182484","text":"Supreme Commander 2 is a real-time strategy (RTS) video game developed by Gas Powered Games and published by Square Enix. It is a sequel to Supreme Commander. A Windows-only demo was initially released via Steam on February 24, 2010, with the full game released on March 2, 2010. A Mac OS X version of Supreme Commander 2 was announced by Mac games publisher Virtual Programming in May 2010. They released the Mac OS X version of the game on September 24, 2010 and released the Infinite War Battle Pack for Mac OS X in January 2011. == Gameplay == In both the skirmish and multiplayer modes, players start out with an Armored Command Unit (ACU), which is a large, powerful, construction- capable unit, as their avatar on the battlefield. They build mass extractors and power generators, which produce mass and energy, along with research facilities that produce research points faster. Players can also build land, air, and sea factories that produce land, air, and sea units, respectively. Players may also build add-on structures, expanding the capabilities of existing factories. Some buildings and units are more advanced than others and as players' bases and research levels expand, so does the quality of their units. Research points can be spent on faction-specific tech trees to add bonuses, abilities and upgrades, and to unlock more-advanced units and buildings. The final result of this development is the unlocking of experimental units, which are large, research-unlocked units and buildings with significantly more power than other units and buildings. Experimental units can be produced from experimental gantries (buildings with the sole purpose of building experimental units) or built by engineers. The ultimate aim of the game is to destroy the opponents' ACUs. In the heavily-scripted campaign mode, the player is provided with a base at the start of the game, and faces an already-established opponent. In order to finish the level, the player has to complete certain objectives, for example \\"destroy the enemy's experimental unit\\". As the campaign progresses, the player is able to unlock a wider range of units, the missions become more challenging, and the enemy grows stronger. In an interview with MacGamer, an online magazine dedicated to gaming on Mac PCs, game designer Chris Taylor had this to say about Supreme Commander 2 and its spiritual link to his previous Total Annihilation series: \\"I think they are indeed the spiritual successors, because of the way I approach RTS Real-time strategy design. I don‚Äôt like a lot of rules, and I like big, open worlds. Some might say the economy systems play a role in that, but I think it goes much deeper than that. I think many folks will see our upcoming Kings and Castles game as a continuing extension of those previous RTS titles.\\" The game is AMD Eyefinity validated. == Plot == The story starts with the newly elected President's assassination, causing the breakup of the coalition formed during the expansion of the first game. The first campaign (dedicated to the UEF or United Earth Federation) follows Dominic Maddox, a UEF officer who is married to an Illuminate. Maddox fights off a rogue Cybran who is later revealed to be William Gauge until the UEF Commander he serves declared that all Illuminate are terrorists and orders him on a mission to \\"round up\\" the Illuminate from his home city. Maddox refuses, goes rogue, and decides to go on his own campaign to remove his old commanding officer from power. Immediately following the defeat of the UEF Commander, he discovers a portal that leads to Seraphim VII, unlocking the second campaign. The second campaign (dedicated to the Illuminate) follows Commander Thalia Kael as she fights under the commands of a group known as the Royal Guardians to \\"restore the Illuminate to their former glory\\" before turning against her former comrades and realizing her mistake and unwittingly aiding Gauge's plans. The Cybran campaign follows Ivan Brackman (an experimental genetic composite clone of Dr. Brackman and Elite Commander Dostya), an old roommate of Maddox, who fights under the direction of Dr. Brackman (whom Ivan refers to as \\"father\\" while attempting to help his friends) against Gauge and his allies. The final battle takes place on the surface of an ancient planetary terraformer called Shiva Prime. After the battle, Ivan comes to a realisation about Shiva Prime and does not conform to his father's will. == Demo == On February 24, 2010, a demo of Supreme Commander 2 was released on the Steam digital distribution service. The demo includes two tutorial levels and two campaign levels all played as the UEF faction, but does not include skirmish or multiplayer modes. The single player includes two missions, which were picked to show the more advanced portion of the game.Clarke, Robert ApertureGames == Reception == On initial release, the game received mixed critical reception. While many critics praised the game as a standalone title, it was generally perceived to be a simplified version of the original game. Alec Meer, reviewing for Eurogamer, predicted that the game would \\"leave much of its intended fanbase cold,\\" and Tom Francis, writing for PC Gamer UK, later summarized Supreme Commander 2 as \\"a game that solved the accessibility issues of the first game, bought primarily by people who didn‚Äôt want them solved.\\" On Metacritic, which aggregates a wide range of reviews and assigns an average score, the game received 77 out of 100 based on 54 reviews. After release, the game received several major updates and changes. For example, one update released in October 2010 reworked the way construction was paid for, as described above. The changes were widely praised and the game was considered by critics to have been improved since release. For example, Tom Francis, who gave the game a score of 85 out of 100 on release, said in October 2010 that had he been reviewing it in October 2010, he would have given it a 90. PC Gamer UK named Supreme Commander 2 their 2010 \\"Co-op Game Of The Year\\". ==References * Category:2010 video games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:MacOS games Category:Square Enix games Category:Total Annihilation Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games ","title":"Supreme Commander 2"},{"id":"20182485","text":"Imre Farkas (23 June 1935 - 10 August 2020)Imre Farkas' obituary was a Hungarian sprint canoer who competed in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Those sharing this surname are the descendants of Bosniaks apprehensive of living under Christian rule after the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, who emigrated to Ottoman Syria. While not originally from one family, most Bosniaks who emigrated to the Levant adopted Bushnak as a common surname, attesting to their origins. Bushnak is also used colloquially among Palestinians to refer to someone who is fair-skinned and good looking. ==History== Some Bosnian movement to Palestine occurred when Bosniak soldiers were brought to Palestine in the late 1800s to provide reinforcements for the Ottoman army. More substantial movement occurred after 1878, when the Austro-Hungarian empire, ruled by the House of Habsburg, occupied Bosnia. Bosniak emigration continued through this period, escalating after the Austro-Hungarian's 1908 annexation of Bosnia. Many emigrated to parts of what is now modern Turkey, while a smaller number settled in Ottoman Syria (modern Syria, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan). Bosnian emigrants settled predominantly in villages in the parts of the present day West Bank and Israel: Caesarea, Yanun, Nablus and Tulkarem. Their descendants still live in these villages, their Bosnian heritage reflected in the Arab surname of Bushnak. The Bosnian Muslim immigrants who settled in Caesarea in 1878 built two mosques, joining other Muslim immigrants from Morocco, Algeria, Crimea, the Caucasus, and Turkestan. These Slavic speaking immigrants eventually assimilated into the local Arab population. ==Notable people bearing the surname== *Ali Bushnaq, Palestinian Mount Everest climber *Ramez Bushnak (1976-2000), an Israeli Arab civilian shot dead by Israeli police during the Second Intifada *Suzan Bushnaq (born 1963), Kuwaiti painter, daughter of Mohammed Bushnaq *Suad Bushnaq, Arab-Canadian film composer *Mohammed Bushnaq (born 1934), Palestinian artist (painter and sculptor) *Lotfi Bouchnak (born 1952), Tunisian singer *Hamid Bouchnak (born 1969), Moroccan ra√Ø singer *Laura Boushnak (born 1976), Kuwaiti-born Palestinian photographer ==See also== *Bosniaks in Syria *Armas *Magyarab *Urums == Notes and references Bibliography=== * Category:Bosnian-language surnames Category:Bosniak diaspora Category:European diaspora in the Arab world Category:European diaspora in Israel Category:European diaspora in Lebanon Category:European diaspora in the State of Palestine Category:European diaspora in Syria Category:Sunni Islam ","title":"Bushnak"},{"id":"20182501","text":"The Canton of Troyes-7 is a former canton of the arrondissement of Troyes, in the Aube department, in northern France.

Squarciafico is best known for bemoaning the printing press in an aphorism that reads as a pithy summation of his contemporaries' concerns over the spread of printed works: \\"Abundance of books makes men less studious\\". Initially, in 1477, he wrote enthusiastically about the works he was engaged in having printed. Yet, a few years later, in 1481, Squarciafico appeared to hold a more skeptical view when he imagined a discussion between the spirits of the great authors of the past being held in the Elysian Fields in which some of them lauded the craft of printing; while others complained that \\"printing had fallen into the hands of unlettered men, who corrupted almost everything\\"; and yet still others lamented that \\"their works would perish if they were not printed, since this art compels all writers to give way to it\\". Squarciafico remains relevant today in criticisms of modern electronic culture; he has, in recent times, been quoted by theologian Walter J. Ong and technology critic Nicholas G. Carr, among others. ==NotesBibliography== * * Category:Italian editors Category:15th-century Italian people ","title":"Hieronimo Squarciafico"},{"id":"20182555","text":"Hayden Chisholm (born 27 May 1975) is a saxophonist and multi-instrumentalist from New Zealand. He performs jazz, improvised music, and contemporary classical music. ==Life and career== Chisholm was raised in New Plymouth, New Zealand, by parents Heather and Doug Chisholm. His first musical experiences came with local Dixieland bands. He began playing clarinet at age nine before switching to what became his primary instrument, the alto saxophone, two years later. The early influences of Johnny Hodges, Sun Ra, Eric Dolphy were strong, being his first jazz records. He was a member of the award-winning New Plymouth Boys' High School Jazz band and won the prize for Most Outstanding Jazz Musician at the National Jazz Festival in Tauranga, 1991. With a DAAD scholarship Chisholm attended the Musik Hochschule in Cologne, Germany. He studied saxophone with Frank Gratkowski. In 1997 he received the New Zealand Young Achievers Award which enabled him to continue his studies abroad. During these years he also studied Carnatic music in Chennai and travelled extensively in the Balkans learning the different musical traditions. During his studies in Cologne Chisholm developed a system of micro-tonal fingerings for saxophone and so called \\"split-scales\\" which he presented on his 1996 debut solo CD Circe on Jazzhaus Musik. These scales split perfect intervals using quarter tones. His microtonal work was later featured on the Root70 album Root70 on 52nd 1/4 Street which received the German Critics Award. During his studies in Cologne he met many musicians he still collaborates with today including Marcus Schmickler, Nils Wogram, John Taylor, Felix Fan, Adrian Brendel, Burnt Friedman, Jochen R√ºckert, Burnt Friedman, Antonis Anissegos, Jaki Liebezeit, Claudio Bohorquez.

WMLK takes its name from MLK, representing the consonants of the Hebrew word \\"malak\\" (◊û÷∑◊ú÷∞◊ê÷∏◊ö÷∞) meaning a \\"messenger\\" or angel. A vocalisation of the word will also yield the definition salt. ==History== Radio broadcasts by the Assemblies of Yahweh began in 1966 and they were called the Sacred Name Broadcast. Elder Jacob O. Meyer - the President of the Assemblies of Yahweh at the time - wanted to find a way of completing the Great Commission of without having to resort to the expensive outreach of using commercial radio stations. After some discussion with the brethren of the Assemblies of Yahweh, they decided that having a radio station of their own would be very advantageous to the ministry. They came to the conclusion that Bethel was strategically placed for sending radio signals throughout the earth, as they could cover much of the earth's landmass from their position. In 1981, the Assemblies of Yahweh bought a 50,000-watt radio transmitter which was converted into a tool for shortwave broadcasting. From this point onwards, the Assemblies of Yahweh began to build their own radio station in order to \\"proclaim Yahweh's Truth.\\" Two prominent members of the Assemblies of Yahweh were hired to work on this project, both in the dismantling and rebuilding of WMLK. One of those individuals was chief engineer Deacon Gary McAvin who, after moving to Bethel with his family has continued to work on the transmitter to this day. ==Shofar== The plans for WMLK's large antenna revealed the shape of a trumpet or shofar' (). These steel posts (once sign posts), hoist the WMLK antennas skyward, standing over a busy Interstate Route 78. The Assemblies of Yahweh believe that this is a fulfilment of the prophecy found in where it talks about making ‚Äòguide-posts‚Äô toward the highway. Meyer took this as symbolising the voice of Yahweh going out in to the world like the blowing of the Shophar in Biblical times. The steel posts used to hoist the antenna grid in the air were recycled from sign posts used on the interstate highway. According to Assemblies of Yahweh reports, WMLK has required much sacrificial dedication from the leadership, and is often referred to as the \\"Messenger of Truth\\". In 1985 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license was granted, and further, permission endorsed to increase the power of the WMLK radio station. ==A New Transmitter in 2020== The Assemblies of Yahweh have now contracted the same company which built the 250 Kw BBC transmitter to build a new model which will enable the ministry to broadcast at up to 300,000 watts. Technological advances to the new antenna will mean not only will the audio clarity be improved but the cost to transmit will be much lower also. The Assemblies of Yahweh have prepared a building for the new instrument and so far it is being prepared in Switzerland and will be shipped to the shores of the U.S as early as 2020. The Assemblies of Yahweh is hoping to acquire the necessary funds to be able to finance this project. ===Sermons=== The station has been used extensively. Sermon and Bible studies have been aired across the globe, proclaiming the message of Yahweh: repentance and obedience to the Biblical Law (). According to the SNB magazine (6/1988), the key targeted areas were Europe and the Middle East,http://www.wmlkradio.net/times.html but the signal waves are not limited and reach far and wide. At present, audiences from 120 countries have responded.(11/1999 ed) Meyer, Jacob WMLK is an expensive project,(11/1999 ed) Meyer, Jacob (p3) but the Assemblies of Yahweh resolutely believe in witnessing this \\"truth\\" of the Bible to the nations. WMLK has stimulated much global response and has also been the theme of numerous newspaper articles. The Assemblies of Yahweh encourage all with access to regularly listen to the sermons, which are occasionally described as \\"the voice crying in the wilderness\\" (). ===Fulfilling prophecy=== The Assemblies of Yahweh believe WMLK will fulfill the prophecy of . Under this interpretation, an angel \\"(malakh)\\" message is proclaiming the exclusive worship of Yahweh (the term 'god' not believing to have appeared in the original texts) and proclaims the fall of Babylon, as well as the final warning message not to take the Mark of the Beast. The radio signal being a message that travels through the air all over the world, like an angel. WMLK has also streamed online through its own websitehttp://wmlkradio.net/wmlk_radio_streaming.htm and on the TuneIn website.http://tunein.com/station/?StationId=176132 WMLK can be heard on a shortwave radio in foreign countries when working at full capacity. ==Other radio stations airing The Sacred Name Broadcast Current stations === (December 2019) ===West Indies=== * DBS Radio (Dominica) 88.1 FM * Radio GBN (Grenada) 535 * Guyana Radio Roraima 760 * Radio St. Lucia 660 * Radio PJD2 (St. Maarten) 1300 * Trinidad Radio Power 102.5 ===Eastern=== * WWSM 1510 * WWVA 1170 * WCKY 1530 ===Central=== * KCKM 1330 AM * WSM 650 AM ===Western=== * KDIA 1640 AM ===Philippines=== * DWNW 756 * DXCC 828 * DXWG 855 ===Nigeria=== *Bayelsa State Radio 97.1 FM *Rivers States Ray Power Radio 105.5 FM *Abia State Radio 88.1 FM *Benue State Radio 95.0 FM *Rock City Radio 101.9 FM *Invicta Radio, Kaduna 98.9 FM ==See also== *Sacred Scriptures Bethel Edition *Jacob O.

He was a notable piano teacher, with students including B√©la Bart√≥k, Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi and Georges Cziffra. His six-volume Technique of Piano Playing is still in use today. ==Early life and education== Thom√°n was born in Homonna, Zempl√©n County, Kingdom of Hungary (now in Slovakia) in 1862 to Jewish parents, Dr. David Thom√°n and Rosa Weisberger.Bayley, Amanda (2001), The Cambridge Companion to Bart√≥k Cambridge University Press, page 17, Recognised for his talent, he became a favorite student of Franz Liszt.

It describes a discussion between an adult poetic speaker and a \\"little cottage girl\\" about the number of brothers and sisters who dwell with her. The poem turns on the question of whether to account two dead siblings as part of the family. ==Background== Wordsworth claimed that the idea for We are Seven came to him while travelling alone across England in October 1793 after becoming separated from his friend, William Calvert. This solitude with nature he claimed encouraged him to reach a deeper understanding where the experience was no longer just for pleasure, as it was in his earlier days, but also hinted at a darker side.Moorman 1968 p. 232 Immersed in these feelings, Wordsworth came to Goodrich Castle and met a little girl who would serve as the model for the little girl in We are Seven. Although there is no documentation on what the little girl actually told him during their conversation, she interested Wordsworth to such an extent that he wrote:Moorman 1968 p. 237 > I have only to add that in the spring of 1841 I revisited Goodrich Castle, > not having seen that part of the Wye since I met the little Girl there in > 1793. It would have given me greater pleasure to have found in the > neighbouring hamlet traces of one who had interested me so much; but it was > impossible, as unfortunately I did not even know her name.Wordsworth 1907 p. > 293 Wordsworth began to write the poem in early 1798 while working on many other poems modelled on the ballad form for a joint poetry collection with Samuel Coleridge. The collection was proposed in March because Wordsworth needed to raise money for a proposed journey to Germany with Coleridge. These poems were included in Lyrical Ballads and A Few Other Poems with a few written by Coleridge.Moorman 1968 pp. 369‚Äì371 Wordsworth describes the moment of finishing the poem: > My friends will not deem it too trifling to relate that while walking to and > fro I composed the last stanza first, having begun with the last line. When > it was all but finished, I came in and recited it to Mr. Coleridge and my > Sister, and said, 'A prefatory stanza must be added, and I should sit down > to our little tea-meal with greater pleasure if my task were finished.' I > mentioned in substance what I wished to be expressed, and Coleridge > immediately threw off the stanza thus:- :'A little child, dear brother Jim,' > ‚Äî I objected to the rhyme, 'dear brother Jim,' as being ludicrous, but we > all enjoyed the joke of hitching-in our friend, James T ‚Äî's name, who was > familiarly called Jim. He was brother of the dramatist, and this reminds me > of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to notice. The said Jem got > a sight of the Lyrical Ballads as it was going through the press at Bristol, > during which time I was residing in that city. One evening he came to me > with a grave face, and said, 'Wordsworth, I have seen the volume that > Coleridge and you are about to publish. There is one poem in it which I > earnestly entrate you will cancel, for, if published, it will make you ever > lastingly ridiculous.' I answered that I felt much obliged by the interest > he took in my good name as a writer, and begged to know what was the > unfortunate piece he alluded to. He said, 'It is called \\"We are seven.\\"' > Nay! said I, that shall take its chance, however, and he left me in despair. The collection, including We are Seven, was accepted by Joseph Cottle in May 1798 and was soon after published anonymously.Moorman 1968 pp. 372‚Äì373 In 1820, the poem was republished as a broadside and titled \\"The Little Maid and the Gentleman\\".Bateson 1954 p. 49 Some guidebooks and locals in the city of Conwy, Wales, claim Wordsworth was inspired to write the poem after seeing a gravestone in St Mary and All Saints Church; this gravestone is marked \\"We are Seven.\\" ==The poem== The poem is a dialogue between a narrator who serves as a questioner and a little girl, with part of the evolving first stanza contributed by Coleridge.Hartman 1967 p. 144 The poem is written in ballad form. The poem begins with the narrator asking: :A simple child, dear brother Jim, :That lightly draws its breath, :And feels its life in every limb, :What should it know of death? (lines 1‚Äì4) He transitions to describe a girl whose beauty pleased him: :She had a rustic, woodland air, :And she was wildly clad; :Her eyes were fair, and very fair; :‚ÄîHer beauty made me glad. (lines 9‚Äì12) He begins to question her about her siblings: :\\"Sisters and brothers, little Maid, :How many may you be?\\" :How many? seven in all,\\" she said, :And wondering looked at me. (lines 13‚Äì16) He questions her further, asking where they are, and she simply responds that two are in Wales, two are at sea, and two are buried in a churchyard near her home. He is confused by her answer and asks: :\\"Yet you are seven; I pray you tell, :\\"Sweet Maid, how this may be?\\" (lines 27‚Äì28) She replies: :\\"Seven boys and girls are we; :\\"Two of us in the church-yard lie, :\\"Beneath the church-yard tree.\\" (lines 30‚Äì32) He questions her further, trying to have her admit that there are only five but she responds: :\\"Their graves are green, they may be seen,\\" :The little Maid replied, :\\"Twelve steps or more from my mother's door,\\" :\\"And they are side by side.\\" :\\"My stockings there I often knit, :\\"My 'kerchief there I hem; :\\"And there upon the ground I sit‚Äî :\\"I sit and sing to them. :\\"And often after sun- set, Sir, :\\"When it is light and fair, :\\"I take my little porringer, :\\"And eat my supper there (lines 36‚Äì48) She then describes how they die, which prompts the narrator to ask: :\\"How many are you then,\\" said I, :\\"If they two are in Heaven?\\" (lines 61‚Äì62) After the little girl repeats that they were seven in number, the narrator, frustrated, replies: :\\"But they are dead: those two are dead! :\\"Their spirits are in Heaven!\\" (lines 65‚Äì66) The poem ends with a divide between the child and the narrator: :'Twas throwing words away: for still :The little Maid would have her will, :And said, \\"Nay, we are seven!\\" (lines 67‚Äì69) Ownership of the poem is in the public domain and the full text can be found on wikisource. ==Interpretation and critical response== In his preface to Lyrical Ballads, Wordsworth wrote that the poems exhibit a \\"power of real and substantial action and suffering\\" and, in particular to We are Seven, to express \\"the perplexity and obscurity which in childhood attend our notion of death, or rather our utter inability to admit that notion\\".Wordsworth 1802 pp. xxx, xiii Geoffrey Hartman points out that there is a subconscious cleaving to an idea to escape from a feeling of separation. The little girl in the poem is unable to realise that she is separated from her dead siblings. She is unable to understand death, and she is forever in an imaginative state of being, and nature is interfering to keep the girl from understanding her separation from her siblings.Hartman 1967 pp. 143‚Äì145 Susan J. Wolfson emphasised the reducing tone of the questioner, which allows the girl to articulate a more Romantic view of presence.Susan Wolfson, The Questioning Presence: Wordsworth, Keats, and the Interrogative Mode in Romantic Poetry, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1986) 50. More recent scholarship, however, focuses on the sociological context for the poem, written the same year that Thomas Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population was published. Frances Ferguson argues that the poem stages a debate about personification in language.Frances Ferguson, Solitude and the Sublime: Romanticism and the Aesthetics of Individuation (New York: Routledge, 1992), 164. Scholars including Aaron Fogel, Hollis Robbins, and Heather Glen argue that the questions asked of the little girl follow the census polling forms proposed by John Rickman in his 1796 census proposal to Parliament.Hollis Robbins, ‚ÄúWilliam Wordsworth's 'We Are Seven' and the First British Census.‚Äù ELN 48.2, Fall/Winter 2010.Aaron Fogel, \\"Wordsworth's \\"We Are Seven\\" and Crabbe's The Parish Register: Poetry and the Anti-Census, Studies in Romanticism 48 (2009)Heather Glen, \\"'We Are Seven' in the 1790s,\\" Grasmere 2012: Selected Papers from the Wordsworth Summer Conference, (Penrith: Humanities Ebooks, 2012 Like Oliver Goldsmith's \\"The Deserted Village,\\" Robbins argues, Wordsworth's \\"We Are Seven\\" \\"promotes a traditional link between individuals and the place they were born.\\"‚ÄúWilliam Wordsworth's 'We Are Seven' and the First British Census.‚Äù ELN 48.2, Fall/Winter 2010. Peter DeBolla argues that the poem is irresolvable partly because of the math in the poem‚Äîthe evenhanded tension between even and odd.Peter De Bolla, Art Matters (Cambridge: Harvard UP, 2001) Maureen McLane reads the poem in the context of moral philosophy and argues that while the girl and the questioner speak the same language, they have wholly different views about time, death, and counting.Maureen N. McLane, Romanticism and the Human Sciences: Poetry, Population, and the Discourse of the Species (Cambridge University Press, 2000) 53‚Äì62. John Mahoney argues, \\"The seemingly silly squabble between adult and child is already a revelation of the early and continuing tension in the poet between the hope for a perpetual bliss and the incursion of a harsh reality.\\"Mahoney 1997 pp. 75‚Äì76 ==See also== *1798 in poetry ==ReferencesBibliography== * Bateson, F.

In 1883 his parents moved to Vienna, where he saw Charles Obra, Mellini, Ben Ali Bey, and other noted performers. He gave his own first public performance at age 18. He billed himself as \\"O.F. Marteau\\". In 1896 Fischer met George Heubeck, who was the successor of Johann Nepomuk Hofzinser, who taught him all of Hofzinser's effects. Fischer also previously had studied with A. Fredmar the only pupil of Compars Herrmann. Fischer confessed that he did not find a lot of personal information about Hofzinser. He based his knowledge mainly on delivered stories and information by Hofzinser's friends and pupils and on detected letters and manuscripts as well as on several magic props of Hofzinser which he got from his friends. Starting in 1898 he managed and appeared regularly at the Kratky Baschik theatre in Vienna, a magic theatre with nearly 1000 seats. For 12 years he performed daily with a two and a half-hour show of magic. Several times Fischer performed before the Imperial Court of Austria and before other crowned heads. He performed for many years as a magician, before retiring after World War I to write a history of the art of magic. Fischer was the founder of the \\"Wiener Magischer Klub\\" and its president for many years. April 1936, was on cover of International Brotherhood of Magicians magazine 'The Linking Ring'. In 1939 the Society of American Magicians made Fischer an honorary member. ==Published works== * J. N.

After the controversy caused by passing of this bill by Virginia representatives, Governor Bob McDonnell amended the bill to include language that would require the written consent of the woman seeking an abortion, and would also require only a transabdominal ultrasound. However, Byron urged rejection of the amendment on its grounds that a transvaginal ultrasound is an invasive procedure because, \\"[i]f we want to talk about invasiveness, there's nothing more invasive than the procedure that she is about to have,\\" she said, referring to her belief that abortions harm viable persons within the womb. In January 2017, she proposed HB2108, a bill that would prevent municipalities from expanding beyond their current footprint and from building and offering broadband to those within the municipalities.Google, Ting, Netflix Dare To Suggest That Maybe Giant, Anti- Competitive ISPs Shouldn't Be Writing State Telecom Laws TechDirt ==Electoral history== {  - !

In addition to the Norwegian production company Sandrew Metronome, the German company Tradewind Pictures and the Spanish Jaleo Films are also part of the project. ==Plot== The film is based on a 2003 novel by the same name, written by Norwegian author Jostein Gaarder. The main character is the young boy Georg who one day finds a long letter from his deceased father in his old red stroller. The letter tells, among other things, about the father's youthful love for the mysterious \\"orange girl\\" (appelsinpiken), and leaves a mystery for Georg to solve. The story leaps back and forth between the father's letters to the future, the young boy's thoughts and the events of the father's life. ==Reception== The newspaper Verdens Gang gave the film four out of six points. The reviewer, Jon Sel√•s, found the film had succeeded in tying together several different story lines in a convincing manner. At the same time he did not think the flow of the dialogue was entirely natural. Among the actors he was most impressed by Annie Dahr Nygaard's effort. ==References * Category:2009 films Category:2009 drama films Category:Norwegian films Category:Norwegian-language films Category:Films directed by Eva Dahr Category:Norwegian drama films ","title":"The Orange Girl"},{"id":"20182955","text":"Greece selected its Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2008 entry by a national final.

It was developed and approved by European Committee for Standardization (CEN, French: Comit√© Europ√©en de Normalisation). This standard series is widely recognized around the world for several countries outside of European Union. It is recognized in Latin American countries, Brasil, African and Asian countries and several islands in the Pacific Ocean. ==CPR Construction Products Regulation EU 305/2011== The Construction Products Regulation (CPR) has been adopted by the European Commission and replaces the Construction Products Directive (CPD) 89/106/EEC as from 1 July 2013.How EN54 are made in the EU The Construction Products Regulation is titled in full \\"Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9th March 2011 laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC\\", and is intended to simplify and clarify the legal framework in this field which was established by Directive 89/106/EEC. The Regulation provides that where a harmonised technical standard exists for a construction product as defined by the Regulation, that product must be tested and certified to that standard by a notified body in order to qualify for a CE Mark. Fire detection and alarm products which are brought to market in the European Union must be tested against the provisions of the relevant part of the EN 54 series and certified accordingly if this part is harmonised. Only when this condition has been satisfied can the CE mark be properly affixed to the product, recognising and demonstrating that the product fulfills the European Union safety and performance requirements and thereby allowing free trade inside the European Union. Therefore, CE mark is a legal requirement for trade within the EU. Any other mark is voluntary and can not substitute the CE mark. It is to ensure the free movement of all construction products within the European Union by harmonizing technical standards with respect to the essential requirements applicable to construction products in terms of health and safety. The main goal is to ensure that construction products are only introduced to the European market if they are fit for their intended use. ==Technical Committees (TC)== You are able to see all Technical Committees at the CEN website: http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/Sectors/Construction/Pages/Workprogramme.aspx ===Technical Committee CEN/TC72 Automatic fire detection system and fire alarm=== It is the TC responsible of developing the normative for fire detection system in the EU and responsible for coordination with committees of each member country to update information and making new normative in fire detection system. The committee of each member country report and depend directly from CEN/TC 72. These committees must inform updates and new normative that is received from CEN/TC72 to responsible office, departments or national organization which has been managed the normative of Fire detection system inside of every member country. These national committees must carry the necessities and new requirement of the industry and user of each country member of Fire detection system to the CEN/TC72 that is the European Committee which is responsible of update and change normative of fire detection system in the European Union. == CE evaluation of conformity == For a product to carry a CE Mark, it must fulfill the essential requirements. Fire alarm and Fire detection products, therefore, must follow the requirement laid down in the Construction Products Regulation for testing by a notified body to be carried out against the harmonised technical standard in the field - EN 54. The testing procedure, which is laid down in detail in EN 54, must be carried out by the approved notified body and the official certificatory Declaration Of Performance should be provided by that body.

He initially planned to study mathematics at university, but changed his mind after an interview with Rudolf Peierls at the University of Birmingham, and enrolled at the University of Sheffield to study chemistry, graduating with a Bsc in 1960. After graduation, he began to study for a PhD at the University of Birmingham in organo-fluorine chemistry, which he completed in 1963, staying until 1965 for the purpose of post-doctoral research. In 1965 he became a lecturer at Durham University, specifically Van Mildert College, where he stayed for over 35 years until his 2003 retirement. In 1967 he married his first wife Jenneke, with whom he has two daughters, Saskia and Marieke. ==Research and academic work== Despite his PhD in organo- fluorine chemistry he switched focus by 1970 to look more at polymer chemistry, specifically polymer synthesis after he had experimented with fluorinated diene monomers and 'found it fascinating that you could take a mobile, colourless fluid and produce a material that had potentially interesting properties.' He helped develop what is now known as the \\"Durham precursor route\\" to manufacturing polyacetylene, and during the 70s and 80s the polymer synthesis knowledge of Feast and his group led to invitations to work as a guest lecturer, and eventually he spent two months a year teaching at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz. During his time at Durham Feast was promoted up the academic ranks, rising from lecturer to senior lecturer in 1965 and professor in 1986. In 1996 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 2006 was elected President for two years of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Other than his appointment at Durham he also held various guest and visiting lecturer positions, including at the University of Leuven between 1985 and 1988, Cornell University in 1993 and the California Institute of Technology in 1999. ==Retirement== He retired in 2003, but continues to work at Durham University as a Research Professor, and also at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In 2004 he was awarded an honorary DSc from the University of Warwick. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for \\"services to polymer chemistry\\" in the 2007 New Year Honours. Later that year he was awarded a Royal Medal for \\"his outstanding contributions to chemical synthesis with far reaching implications, particularly for the field of functional polymeric materials.\\" ==References== Category:British chemists Category:Royal Medal winners Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Academics of Durham University Category:Alumni of the University of Sheffield Category:Alumni of the University of Birmingham Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Chemistry Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:People educated at King Edward VI School, Lichfield Category:Presidents of the Royal Society of Chemistry Category:Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research alumni Category:Max Planck Society alumni ","title":"Jim Feast"},{"id":"20183005","text":"Ond≈ôej Li≈°ka (born 14 July 1977 in Brno; ) is a Czech politician, who served as Minister of Education under Prime Minister Mirek Topol√°nek in his second cabinet.

It is viscid when moist from a gelatinous pellicle, staining slightly greenish-blue when injured or with age. *The gills are adnate or sinuate or adnexed, close to sub-distant and moderately broad, yellowish brown at first, soon violet brown or chocolate brown to blackish violet, and uniform or somewhat mottled, with whitish edges. *The spores are (8.2)9.3 ‚Äî 10.4(13.5) X 6 ‚Äî 7.1(7.7) x 5.5 ‚Äî 6.6 Œºm, subrhomboid in face view, subellipsoid in side view, with a hilar appendage visible and a truncate apex with a broad germ pore, thick walled, and dingy yellow brown. *The stipe is (2)3.5 ‚Äî 6.5(7.5) cm x (1.5)2 ‚Äî 4(6) mm, equal or slightly enlarged at the base, cylindric or subcylindric, twisted striate at times, flexuous, glabrous to slightly fibrillose, dry, stuffed with a pith and becoming hollow, and white or whitish silky to ochraceous or brownish fibrillose. The partial veil thinly membranous, leaving a fragile annulus that becomes more noticeable as it darkens with spores. It stains blue-green when injured. The spore print is dark violacous brown. *The taste and odor of Psilocybe stuntzii are farinaceous. *Microscopic features: The basidia are 16.5 ‚Äî 33 x 5.5 ‚Äî 8.8 Œºm, 4-spored, and hyaline. Pleurocystidia are absent and cheilocystidia are 22 ‚Äî 30 x 4.4 ‚Äî 6.6 Œºm, abundant, forming a sterile band, hyaline, lageniform, fusiform-lanceolate or fusoid-ampullaceous, with an elongate and flexuous neck, and are 1 ‚Äî 2.2 Œºm in diameter, sometimes irregularly branched. Clamp connections are present. ==Habitat and distribution== Psilocybe stuntzii spores seen through a microscope Psilocybe stuntzii is found growing scattered to gregarious to cespitose, rarely solitary, in conifer wood chips and bark mulch, in soils rich in woody debris, and in new lawns of freshly laid sod or any newly mulched garden throughout the western region of the Pacific Northwest. From late July through December, has been observed growing all year long in the Seattle, Washington area, also reported from California, rarely as far south as Santa Cruz. There was a time when this mushroom appeared in over 40 percent of all new lawns and mulched in areas in the Puget Sound region of the Pacific Northwest. Due to a disappearance of pastures south of Seattle in the Tukwila-Kent-Auburn areas, this mushroom now only appears sporadically in certain new lawns which are well fertilized and manicured. ==Edibility== This mushroom is hallucinogenic. Additionally, it closely resembles the highly toxic Galerina marginata, and several poisonings have been attributed to collectors consuming G. marginata after mistaking them for hallucinogenic P. stuntzii. ==See also== *Psilocybin mushrooms *List of Psilocybin mushrooms ==NotesReferences== *Mycologia 68(6): 1261 (1977) * *Guzm√°n, G.

The NIGP Code is a coding taxonomy used primarily to classify products and services procured by state and local governments in North America. The classification system was developed in the mid 1980s as a result of efforts by public procurement officials in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Illinois and other states, cities and counties to provide a mechanism to classify the products and services that used in public procurement. Led by Homer Forrestor, the Director of General Services in Texas, the group produced the initial codeset in 1983. The copyright for the data file was transferred to the National Institute of Governmental Purchasing (NIGP), an organization founded in 1944, and the NIGP Code was born. The NIGP Code is now the standard taxonomy for classifying commodities and services for 33 states and thousands of local entities within North America (utilized by entities in 47 states, plus the District of Columbia, Canada, and Puerto Rico). NIGP appointed Periscope Holdings, Inc., as the custodian of the NIGP Code in 2001. The firm is responsible for licensing, overseeing code change requests, publication of version releases, communication with end users, phone support, training, integrity of the codeset, and commodity coding services for the conversion of contract and inventory files. The NIGP Code is most commonly used to classify vendors and to track spending data for use in strategic sourcing and spending analysis. The database is often incorporated into the procurement software utilized by the entity for use in e-procurement. Categorization, reporting, and transparency are all key goals and benefits of this coding structure. The NIGP Code currently exists in English and Spanish versions. Cross references have been created for the NAICS, UNSPSC and MCC codesets. Version 24 is the current release for printed materials. ==NIGP Code structure== The NIGP Code is structured as follows:NIGP Code sample, NIGP Code sample 3-Digit Class Code The 3-Digit class Code has a brief general description. This level contains 219 Commodity (Product) Classes and 55 Service Classes totaling 274 Classes. The 3-Digit Code is primarily used to generate periodic expenditure history by department for fiscal planning, budget execution, and accounting. 5-Digit Class-Item Code The 5-Digit class-item Code is an expanded version of the 3-Digit class Code. Currently, it contains over 8,700 descriptions. This level categorizes vendors by class-item to allow your procurement software to automate bidder selection, produce no-bid response reports, vendor performance reports, and minority business and HUB reports by Code. Purchase history can be captured at this level as well. 7-Digit Class-Item-Group Code The 7-Digit Code provides an additional level of purchase description. It contains over 29,000 descriptions. It can be used to develop a specification file and is used with the 11-Digit Code to create a comprehensive purchase description. 11-Digit Class-Item-Group-Detail Code The 11-Digit Code is generally used to create, manage, and maintain line-item term contracts. It is also used to identify stock items in inventory. This level of the Code currently contains over 250,000 descriptions which provides a great amount of flexibility when creating contracts and tracking inventory. {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Code Structure !

The most common is via the NIGP Code web search tool, the NIGP Living Code, which hosts a search engine for the Code for end users. The site also has a download section, which provides for end user download of the entire codeset or modifications to the codeset since the last download by the user. The download file can be formatted as an Excel, tab-delimited or CSV file. In addition, the Code is available via printed format in the Alphabetical Index Book and the Class Item Book. ==NIGP Code maintenance== Maintenance and additions/clarifications to the Code come from three primary sources: codes generated by direct customer requests, codes identified as part of coding services, and codes identified from seated working groups. Additions/clarifications at the 3 and 5 digit level are typically processed within 24 hours. Code requests targeted at the 7 and 11 digit levels typically are processed within 2‚Äì3 days, although codes can be generated within 24 hours under certain circumstances. Updates to the Code are published weekly to the nigp.com site for download by users. Codes requested directly from users are typically delivered via extract files to the user, with general release of the new codes in the weekly website update. ==Environmentally certified codes== In 2009, the NIGP Code went green by classifying items that fit sustainable procurement and providing a tool for reporting on green spend. The Code was updated to identify ‚Äúenvironmentally certified‚Äù products, which have been set up as a green counterpart of standard classes. There is a set of 10 initial Class Code selections that cover everything from computer accessories to janitorial supplies to paper products. This initial set of codes was determined by a Code Green Workgroup that was made up of representatives from states, cities, counties, schools, and Green Seal. Code subscribers are currently utilizing the codes in their reporting of Sustainable Procurement and/or Environmentally Preferable Purchasing initiatives. Product types that are currently covered include janitorial supplies, office supplies, computer software, computer hardware, paint, and paper products. ==See also== * Government procurement * Buyer leverage * Contract Management * E-procurement * Global sourcing * Purchasing * Procurement software * Spend management * Rate contract * Reverse auction * Spending analysis * Strategic sourcing * Turnkey * Tendering * Auction == References  Category:Government procurement in the United States ","title":"NIGP Code"},{"id":"20183114","text":"National Capital Park and Planning Commission may refer to * Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission * National Capital Planning Commission, formerly known by this name from 1926 to 1952 and previously as the National Capital Park Commission ","title":"National Capital Park and Planning Commission"},{"id":"20183191","text":"Boris Becker was the defending champion but he lost in the quarter-finals to Arnaud Boetsch.

Since Fall 2011 it has been located at 5106 Penn Avenue. The structure of The Mr. Roboto Project was modeled partially after the 924 Gilman St club in Berkeley, CA, combined with elements of the East End Food Co-op in Pittsburgh, PA. ==Membership== The cooperative runs on a membership basis, with its members responsible for the direction of the venue. There is a 5-person board of directors who deal with the day-to-day operations, elected of any member who wishes to run for a position. Meetings are held once a month, with both members and non-members encouraged to attend. The initial membership cost is $25, with a $10 per year renewal fee. The shows at the venue are booked by its members - while there is a wide variety of different musical groups and stylings being presented, most could be placed under the general banner of \\"punk.\\" ==Early history== The beginnings of what would become the Mr. Roboto Project began in 1998. At that time there were few options for all-ages, DIY punk/hardcore/indie rock shows; most of the shows at that time were done in a handful of punk houses, most notably the Peach Pitt in South Oakland. The only consistent DIY venue was the Millvale Industrial Theater (MIT), which was outside the city limits. In 1998, the scene began to grow, the idea to create a collectively run venue in the spirit of 924 Gilman or ABC-No-Rio was hatched. In January 1999, the first organizational meeting was held at the Peach Pitt. About 15-20 people showed up. At this meeting some of the basic structure of Roboto was formed including choosing to be set up as a cooperative with a Board of Directors rather than a strict collective. The original membership structure was decided at this meeting as well. The name \\"Mr. Roboto's\\" was chosen as a working title. Several other ideas were originally tossed out, most having some local significance, such as \\"The Keystone Collective.\\" However, in the end, most of these were poorly received by the group. Over the coming months the group began a search for a location but had very little luck until late summer. During the previous year there had been a string of shows held at the Move Studio, a dance studio located in the borough of Wilkinsburg, just outside Pittsburgh's East End. Roboto checked out the two neighboring buildings to the Move Studio and was on the verge of signing a rent-to-own agreement for the building directly next door. At this time the owner of the Move Studio expressed concern that noise from Roboto's shows would interfere with her dance studio. She recommended that the group contact the Wilkinsburg Chamber of Commerce to learn about other properties available in the area. This led to the group meeting up with Mark Smith, the head of the local Chamber of Commerce, and checking out an empty storefront location at 722 Wood Street. Plans were made to begin renting the storefront in November 1999. At that time Local promoter John Fail was looking for a venue for the second incarnation of his ADD Fest (an event with approximately 10 bands all playing 10-minute sets) and it was decided to make this Roboto's opening show. The event was planned for November 12, 1999. Due to some delays, members of Roboto were unable to get access to the space until November 11. ADD Fest 2 went off without major incident the following day. The group continued to rent the Wood Street storefront until Fall 2011, when they moved to their current location. Prominent bands to play the original Roboto space include The Blood Brothers, American Nightmare, The Nerve Agents, Taking Back Sunday, Anti-Flag, Count the Stars, and Against Me! == Roboto II == For a brief time in 2001, the Mr. Roboto Project opened a second Wlkinsburg venue called Roboto II. The space was a much larger, 400-capacity show space and zine library. The building was just blocks from the original Wood Street location, which remained open. Roboto II featured larger touring acts including Atmosphere, Converge, Thursday, American Nightmare, Thrice, Bane, Piebald, The Lawrence Arms, and many others. The space closed after less than a year of operation. ==See also== 924 Gilman Street ABC No Rio Che Cafe Lemp Neighborhood Arts Center ==References * Official Mr. Roboto Project Website Category:Social centres in the United States Category:Music venues in Pittsburgh Category:DIY culture Category:Punk rock venues Category:All-ages DIY venues in the United States ","title":"Mr. Roboto Project"},{"id":"20183261","text":"Thomas A. \\"Tom\\" Tangretti (born September 20, 1946) is a Democratic member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 57th District and was elected in 1988.

The first recorded mention of the castle was in 1333. In 1961 Kr√°sna H√¥rka was designated a National Cultural Monument of the Slovak Republic. It was said to be one of the country's best-preserved castles. On 10 March 2012 the castle was extensively damaged by fire, due to some teens carelessly discarding a cigarette which set the grass on fire. ==Etymology== The name means \\"a beautiful mountain\\" ( - beautiful, h√¥rka - a little mountain). Unlikely but possible is a derivation from the word kras (karst), because the karst is in the neighbourhood. ==History== The castle was built in the 13th century by the hungarian √Åkos brothers\\"Filip and Detre Sz√°rs from the √Åkos family\\" on a trade route leading from Transylvania through Ko≈°ice to Spi≈° and today's Poland. The √Åkos family (which later changed its name to Bebek) lived in Kr√°sna H√¥rka from the mid-13th century to 1566, apart from a short period when the Mari√°ssy family seized control of the castle. In 1578 the castle passed into the hands of [the Hungarian] P√©ter Andr√°ssy and remained in the possession of the Andr√°ssy family up until 1918 (the year the First Czechoslovak Republic was founded). During 2010 and 2011 the castle underwent renovation and was re-opened to public in April, 2011. ==2012 fire== On 10 March 2012, the castle was badly damaged by fire. The fire was caused by two young boys who attempted to light up a cigarette and accidentally lit grass on the hill, from where it spread to the castle. The castle building suffered extensive damage. The roof, the exhibition area in the Gothic palace and the bell tower were completely destroyed. Three bells in the bell tower were melted by the heat. Initially, it was thought that many of the building's historic artefacts had been destroyed. However, according to the Interior Minister of Slovakia Daniel Lip≈°ic, \\"...the vast majority of exhibits remained undamaged\\". (\\"Drtiv√° vƒõt≈°ina expon√°t≈Ø je na≈°tƒõst√≠ nepo≈°kozen√°...\\") Daniel Krajcer, Minister of Culture, commented that only the upper part of the castle (including collections) had been destroyed.

His recurring subjects include literary and film noir, the Hollywood studio system and the American comics industry. De Haven is noted for his comics-themed novels, including the Derby Dugan trilogy and It's Superman. ==Life and career== De Haven was born in Bayonne, New Jersey. He attended Catholic school, where he was a classmate of fellow author George R. R. Martin, though he notes that they weren't friends, even though Martin was an editor of the school newspaper where he was a cartoonist. De Haven originally wanted to be cartoonist before attending college, but by the time he graduated from the university, he realized that he would never be a professional cartoonist, and considers the realization \\"the First Great Disappointment of My Life\\". He received a Sociology degree from Rutgers University in 1971 and an MFA from Bowling Green State University in 1973. An avid reader of comic books and graphic novels, De Haven considers himself a narrative writer, and considers the storytelling style of comics to have been a major influence on his writing since he was a child of almost six or seven. He began teaching creative writing part-time at Hofstra University in 1981, before moving in 1987 to Rutgers to teach American Studies (including one of the first college courses on American comics) before relocating to Richmond, Virginia to become a full-time teacher. De Haven is currently a full professor of Creative Writing at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia in the MFA program, and often teaches at least one American Studies course, including \\"The Graphic Novel\\". De Haven is also the co-creator with author Laura Browder of the VCU's First Novelist Award, honoring the best debut novel published during a calendar year. He is also a licensed private investigator. He considers himself a Democrat, and has been criticized for anti-Republican statements he has made over the years. The author noted in an interview that he agreed with Robert Crumb's observation that the Thirties was the pinnacle of American culture. He also notes in the same interview that he finds truth to Art Spiegelman's statement \\"that we are, for whatever reason, most nostalgic for the decade before the one we were born in\\", as he was born in the Forties. As a freelance journalist, he has written criticism for publications such as the New York Times Book Review and Entertainment Weekly. De Haven's novels include the Funny Paper trilogy (consisting of Funny Papers (1985), Derby Dugan's Depression Funnies (1996) and Dugan Under Ground (2001)). The trilogy's storyline stretches from the beginnings of the newspaper comic strips in the 1890s to the 1970s. The New York Times Book Review called the Derby books \\"a mighty accomplishment: John Dos Passos's U.S.A. trilogy for comic geeks.\\" The Boston Globe hails the trilogy as a \\"wild ride\\" In 2005, his novel It's Superman reinvented the early years of the well-known superhero of the same name amidst the Great Depression. The author noted his initial apprehension when he was contacted by DC Comics in 1997 in regards to writing a novel about Superman: \\"[S]hould I do a novel with a character that I don't own? So I had to think about it, but I didn't think about it very long, really. I just thought...this is too good to let go...they were giving me carte blanche.\\" He states that his prior novels about comic strips are what prompted DC to contact him about writing the period piece. For the novel, he took as his inspiration the early Superman stories of the thirties through the fifties; wherein the hero is not fighting super-villains and Lex Luthor, but clearing slums in the New Deal era and exposing corrupt politicians. De Haven says he was aiming for his hero to develop a social conscience during the Great Depression. He states in the interview that only real departure from the Superman that Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster originally created is that while their original hero lived in Cleveland, De Haven places his hero in the real \\"Metropolis\\" of New York. ==Awards and honors== De Haven's awards include a fellowship from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, and he has twice won fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. His novel, Depression Funnies, received an American Book Award in 1997. Dugan Under Ground received the Library of Virginia Fiction Award (also called the Library of Virginia Literary Awards. ==Works Novels === * Freaks' Amour (1979) * Jersey luck: A novel (1980) * Funny Papers (1985) * The Orphan's Tent (1986) * Top Secret U.S.S.A.: Book 1 (1987) * Joe Gosh (1988) * Neuromancer: the Graphic Novel, Volume 1 (1989) * Pixie Meat (1990) * Sunburn Lake (1990) * Walker of Worlds (Chronicles of the King's Tramp, Book 1) (1991) * End-Of-Everything Man (Chronicles of the King's Tramp, Book 2) (1992) * The Last Human (Chronicles of the King's Tramp, Book 3) (1992) * Derby Dugan's Depression Funnies (1996) * Green Candles (with artist Robin Smith, Paradox Graphic Mystery) (1997) * Dugan Under Ground: A Novel (2001) * It's Superman!

She was an elder sister of the Kingdom of Saxony's last king, Frederick Augustus III of Saxony. ==Life== As a young girl, Mathilde was quiet and gentle, but she was not especially good-looking. Her father, George of Saxony, had planned a marriage between Mathilde and Archduke Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia, however Rudolf rejected this arrangement and instead married Princess St√©phanie of Belgium. It was then agreed that Mathilde would marry a nephew of Emperor Franz Joseph I and the presumptive heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. However, Franz Ferdinand rejected this arrangement. Dynastic relations between the Saxon royal family and the Habsburgs were once again strained when Franz Ferdinand chose to marry (morganatically) Sophie Chotek, Countess Chotek of Wognin. (Relations between the two nations improved only when Mathilde's younger sister Maria Josepha married her second cousin, Archduke Otto Francis.) Mathilde became embittered by these rejections and turned critical and waspish; she also turned to alcohol to ease her unhappiness, acquiring the nickname \\"Schnapps-Mathilde\\" for obvious reasons. She made life difficult for other members of the royal family, and as a consequence was the least popular of the family by a wide margin among the people of Saxony. She was a talented painter and took lessons from the artist Alfred Diethe from 1890 to 1901. Some of her paintings, mainly landscapes and scenes of court life in Pillnitz, were made into prints. Others appeared on postcards, which were sold to raise money for charity. Mathilde died unmarried on 27 March 1933 at the age of 70. She was interred in the New Tomb of the Katholische Hofkirche in Dresden. ==Titles and styles== *19 March 1863 ‚Äì 27 March 1933: Her Royal Highness Princess Mathilde of Saxony, Duchess of Saxony ==AncestryReferences== Category:1863 births Category:1933 deaths Category:House of Wettin Category:Saxon princesses Category:Dames of the Order of Saint Isabel Category:Dames of the Order of the Starry Cross Category:Burials at Katholische Hofkirche Category:Nobility from Dresden Category:German Roman Catholics Category:Albertine branch Category:Artists from Dresden ","title":"Princess Mathilde of Saxony (born 1863)"},{"id":"20183618","text":"Ebenezer Dorkutso Dugbatey (born 31 July 1973) is a Ghanaian former professional football defender who played for clubs in Africa and Europe. ==Club career== Dugbatey was born in Accra.

He has served as the Member of Parliament for Remutaka (formerly named Rimutaka) since the 2008 election. He is a member of Cabinet for the Sixth Labour Government, serving as the Minister of Education, Minister of Health, Minister of State Services and Leader of the House. ==Early life== Hipkins was born in the Hutt Valley. He attended Waterloo Primary School and Hutt Intermediate. He was Head Boy at Hutt Valley Memorial College (later known as Petone College) in 1996. He joined the Labour Party in the same year. Hipkins went on to complete a bachelor of arts degree majoring in politics and criminology at Victoria University of Wellington, where he was student president in 2000 and 2001. He also holds a National Certificate in Adult Education and Training, and a postgraduate certificate in public policy from Victoria University of Wellington. ==Before politics== After graduating, Hipkins held a number of jobs, including working as a policy advisor for the Industry Training Federation, and as a training manager for Todd Energy in Taranaki. Hipkins also worked in Parliament as an advisor to Trevor Mallard and Helen Clark. ==Member of ParliamentFifth National Government, 2008‚Äì2017=== Hipkins was selected to stand in the Labour-held seat of Rimutaka (renamed Remutaka in 2020) in the 2008 general election, following the retirement of sitting MP Paul Swain. Hipkins won the seat with a majority of 753. Following the election, he was appointed the Labour spokesperson for Internal Affairs. In May 2010, his Electricity (Renewable Preference) Amendment Bill was drawn from the member's ballot. It was defeated at its first reading in June. The 2011 general election saw Hipkins increase his winning margin in Rimutaka to 3,286. He became the Labour Party's Chief Whip. He also held the State Services and Associate Education spokesperson roles. In the 2014 general election he increased his majority again to 6,664. In late 2015, Hipkins received veiled threats, including a death threat, for voicing his concerns about a billboard advertising guns. In April 2016, his Education (Charter Schools Abolition) Amendment Bill was drawn from the members' ballot. It was defeated at its first reading in November. ===Coalition Government, 2017‚Äìpresent=== NZEI strike rally outside Parliament, 15 August 2018 Hipkins was elected as a Cabinet minister by the Labour Party caucus following the formation of a Labour ‚Äì New Zealand First coalition government supported by the Greens. It was later announced that he would serve as Minister for Education. As Education Minister, Hipkins has supported the abolition of National Standards and charter schools in New Zealand, which were supported by the previous National Government. He has also signaled a review of the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) high school certificate system. However, Hipkins has clarified that the Ministry of Education would continue to fund the University of Otago's National Monitoring Study of Student Achievement and the Progress and Consistency Tool (PaCT). The Government's announcement that it would close charter schools drew criticism from the opposition National and ACT parties. In early 2018, Hipkins introduced legislation preventing the creation of new charter schools, while enabling existing charter schools to be converted into special character schools. By September 2018, all twelve charter schools had successfully transitioned to become state-integrated and special character schools. In December 2018, Hipkins rejected a recommendation by Victoria University of Wellington's Council to rename the university \\"University of Wellington\\", citing the strong opposition to the name change from staff, students, and alumni. In justifying his decision, Hipkins stated \\"that he was not convinced the university had sufficiently engaged with stakeholders, who should have their views considered.\\" In February 2019, Hipkins proposed merging the country's sixteen polytechnics into a New Zealand Institute of Skills & Technology to counter deficits and declining domestic enrollments. This proposed Institute of Skills and Technology will also take over the country's vocational and apprenticeship programmes. While the Tertiary Education Union, Employers and Manufacturers Union, and the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce have expressed support for the Government's proposal, this has been criticised by the opposition National Party, Southern Institute of Technology CEO Penny Simmonds, and Mayor of Invercargill Tim Shadbolt. In response to the Christchurch mosque shootings, Hipkins extended the polytechnic submission timeframe to 5 April 2019. In early May 2019, Hipkins announced that the Government would be investing NZ$95 million to train 2,400 new teacher trainees through increased scholarships and placements, new employment-based teacher education programmes, and iwi-based scholarships over the next four years to address the teaching shortage. These measures were criticised as inadequate by the Post Primary Teachers' Association and National Party education spokesperson Nikki Kaye. On 1 August 2019, Hipkins reaffirmed the Government's plan merge all polytechnics into a single entity in April 2020. In addition, he announced that the Government would replace all 11 industrial training organisations (ITOs) with between four and seven workforce development councils that would be set up by 2022 to influence vocational education and training. While polytechnics have been cautiously optimistic about the changes despite concerns about losing their autonomy, ITOs and National's tertiary education spokesperson Shane Reti have opposed these changes, claiming they would damage the vocational training system and cause job losses. Following the resignation of David Clark as Minister of Health on 2 July 2020, Prime Minister Ardern appointed Hipkins as interim Health Minister until the 2020 New Zealand general election scheduled for October 2020. Hipkins was re-elected to the seat of Remutaka in the 2020 New Zealand election. He won his electorate by the largest margin out of all candidates. He also won the most number of votes of any candidate. ==References * MPs webpage - - - - - - - Category:New Zealand Labour Party MPs Category:Members of the New Zealand House of Representatives Category:New Zealand MPs for Hutt Valley electorates Category:Living people Category:1978 births Category:Victoria University of Wellington alumni Category:Victoria University of Wellington Students' Association presidents Category:21st-century New Zealand politicians Category:Candidates in the 2017 New Zealand general election Category:Members of the Cabinet of New Zealand Category:New Zealand education ministers Category:Candidates in the 2020 New Zealand general election ","title":"Chris Hipkins"},{"id":"20183681","text":"Kathiani Constituency is an electoral constituency in Kenya.

The collapse, along with the 2008 P√©tion-Ville school collapse, was the second such incident in Haiti in less than a week. == Collapse == The school building was a two-story concrete structure built on the side of a hill. According to one AFP witness, \\"chunks of the school's walls were scattered on the ground, its concrete roof was sagging, and there were clear cracks in the remaining walls\\". No cause was immediately apparent, but poor- quality construction and heavy rains in the preceding days were believed to have been contributing factors. The Red Cross reported that some students were jumping and dancing in a musical just prior to collapse, which may have strained the weakened structure. == Casualties == Around 100 students, ages 5 to 12, attended Grace Divine School. The collapse occurred during a break in classes, when most of the school's students were outside in the yard. At least nine individuals were injured, including two students who were taken to hospital. A preliminary search reported that no one was trapped in the debris and that there were no fatalities. Compared to the P√©tion-Ville disaster, the number and severity of casualties in Port-au-Price were low because of relatively little damage to the buildings and most students were outside of the building during collapse. == Reaction and rescue == After hearing of the collapse parents anxiously gathered at the school, fearing a similar deadly outcome of the collapse of the La Promesse school in P√©tion-Ville. Foreign and domestic rescue teams were quick to arrive on scene due to their involvement in the P√©tion-Ville collapse. At one school a mile away from Grace Divine, students believed their own school building was shaking; there was no damage but two children were injured in the panic. Initial information about the disaster was reported to the international media by Dr. Jean Pierre Guiteau, the executive officer of the Haitian Red Cross. == References == Category:Building collapses in 2008 Category:2008 in Haiti Category:Man-made disasters in Haiti Category:Disasters in schools Category:21st century in Port-au-Prince Category:Building collapses ","title":"Grace Divine School collapse"},{"id":"20183685","text":"Executive Recycling is an Englewood, Colorado-based business specializing in electronic waste recycling.Executive Recycling: About 60 Minutes linked Executive Recycling to the illegal export of electronic waste from the Denver area to Guiyu, China.

The poem is excluded from the series because the traditional \\"Lucy\\" poems are uncertain about the age of Lucy and her actual relationship with the narrator, and Lucy Gray provides exact details on both.Jones 1995 p. 11 Furthermore, the poem is different than the \\"Lucy\\" poems in that it relies on narrative storytellingJones 1995 p. 77 and is a direct imitation of the traditional 18th century ballad form.Stork 1914 p. 305 > LUCY GRAY Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray, And, when I crossed the Wild, I > chanced to see at break of day The solitary Child. No mate, no comrade Lucy > knew; She dwelt on a wide Moor, -The sweetest Thing that ever grew Beside a > human door! You yet may spy the Fawn at play, The Hare upon the Green; But > the sweet face of Lucy Gray Will never more be seen. ‚ÄúTo-night will be a > stormy night, You to the Town must go, And take the lantern, Child, to light > Your Mother through the snow.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat, Father! Will I gladly do; ‚ÄòThis > scarcely afternoon- The Minster-clock had just struck two, And yonder is the > moon.‚Äù At this the Father raised his hook And snapp'd a faggot-band; He > plied his work ‚Äì and Lucy look The lantern in her hand. Not blither is the > mountain roe; With many a wanton stroke Her feet disperse the powdery snow, > That rises up like smoke. The storm came on before its time, She wander'd up > and down, And many a hill did Lucy climb But never reach'd the Town. The > wrecked Parents all that night Went shouting far and wide; But there was > neither sound nor sight To serve them for a guide. At day-break on a hill > they stood That overlooked the Moor; And thence they saw the Bridge of Wood > A furlong from their door. They wept, and turning homeward cried \\"In Heaven > we all shall meet!\\" When in the snow the Mother spied the print of Lucy's > feet. Then downward from the steep hill's edge They tracked the footmarks > small; And through the broken hawthorn-hedge, And by the long stone-wall; > And then an open field they crossed, The marks were still the same; They > tracked them on, nor ever lost, And to the Bridge they came. They followed > from the snowy bank The footmarks, one by one, Into the middle of the plank, > And further there were none. Yet some maintain that to this day She is a > living Child, That you may see sweet Lucy Gray Upon the lonesome Wild. Over > rough and smooth she trips along, And never looks behind; And sings a > solitary song That whistles in the wind. ==Themes== Bennett Weaver points out that \\"The dominant theme of the poems of 1799 is death: death for the children of the village school, for Matthew's daughter, and for Lucy Gray\\",Weaver 1960 p. 233 and Mary Moorman believes that Lucy Gray is the \\"most haunting of all his ballads of childhood\\".Moorman 1968 p. 426 Lucy Gray, like the Lucy of the Lucy poems and Ruth of Wordsworth's \\"Ruth\\" are, according to H. W. Garrod, part of \\"an order of beings who have lapsed out of nature ‚Äì the nature of woods and hills ‚Äì into human connections hardly strong enough to hold them. Perpetually they threaten to fall back into a kind of things or a kind of spirits.\\"Garrod 1927 84‚Äì85 Wordsworth is trying to describe how Lucy, a girl connected to nature, dies.Beer 1978 p. 95 She is part of nature, according to Robert Langbaum, because Wordsworth \\"makes the human figure seem to evolve out of and pass back into the landscape\\".Langbaum 1967 p. 270 Henry Crabb Robinson explains that Wordsworth's point \\"was to exhibit poetically entire solitude, and he represents the child as observing the day-moon, which no town or village girl would ever notice\\".Robinson 1967 p. 48 However, her connection with nature makes it is possible that Lucy's spirit is able to survive. The feeling in Lucy Gray, as John Beer writes, is counter to the feeling in \\"She dwelt among the untrodden ways\\" that \\"No amount of dwelling on her significance as an embodiment of life-forces can reduce by one iota the dull fact of her death and the necessary loss to all who love her.\\"Beer 1978 pp. 95‚Äì96 Wordsworth wrote, in reference to Lucy Gray, \\"the way in which the incident was treated and the spiritualizing of the character might furnish hints for contrasting the imaginative influences which I have endeavoured to throw over common life with Crabbe's matter of fact style of treating subjects of the same kind\\".Wordsworth 1991 p. 294 By this, Raymond Havens points out, Wordsworth is trying to pull away from realism into a state dominated by the imagination.Havens 1941 p. 21 To Wordsworth, the imagination was connected to both ethics and aesthetics, and he sought to exalt the imagination in Lucy Gray.Havens 1941 p. 246 Paul De Man believes that there is a \\"loss of name in the Lucy Gray poems where death makes her into an anonymous entity\\".De Man 1987 p. 12 However, some critics, like Mark Jones, believe that, in arguing for \\"a more general symbolic or literary value for Lucy Gray\\" or deemphasising Lucy Gray's identity as an individual, a critic \\"obliterates her status as human pure and simple, or, what is the same, underrates the importance of this status.\\"Jones 1995 p. 194 ==Reception== William Blake marked the poems Lucy Gray, \\"Strange fits\\", and \\"Louisa\\" with an \\"X\\", which provoked Jones to write, \\"The award for minimalist commentary must go to William Blake\\".Jones 1995 p. 58 Matthew Arnold believed that Lucy Gray was \\"a beautiful success\\" when contrasting how it is able to emphasise an incorporeal side of nature, and he believed that the poem \\"The Sailor's Mother\\" was \\"a failure\\" for its lack of the incorporeal.Arnold 1879 p. xxii However, Swinburne believed that \\"The Sailor's Mother\\" was \\"the deeper in its pathos, the more enduring in its effect, the happier if also the more venturous in its simplicity\\".Miscellanies 1886 p. 131 A. C. Bradley believes that \\"there is too much reason to fear that for half his readers his 'solitary child' is generalised into a mere 'little girl,' and that they never receive the main impression he wished this is very wrong where is the actual theme written to produce. Yet his intention is announced in the opening lines, and as clearly shown in the lovely final stanzas, which gives even to this ballad the visionary touch\\".Bradley 1959 p. 143 ==References== * Arnold, Matthew. \\"Preface\\" in Poems of Wordsworth.

Jones, both of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. From 1959 to 1967, Judge Kay worked as a public defender for the Public Defender Service, and as a federal prosecutor for the United States Attorney's Office in the District of Columbia. From 1967 until his appointment, he worked in private practice as a named partner at the Washington law firm of Bregman, Abell & Kay. He became a United States Magistrate Judge for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in September 1991. == Notable Cases Rulings on Guantanamo habeas corpus petitions=== Judge Kay heard several habeas corpus petitions submitted on behalf of detainees held in extrajudicial detention in the United States's Guantanamo Bay detention camps in Cuba. Judge Kay ruled on issues arising from the \\"Protective Order\\" that governed legal counsel's access to detainees. Judge Kay's opinions have been quoted extensively by national news organizations. In Adem v. Bush, 425 F. Supp. 2d 7 (D.D.C. 2006), Judge Kay ordered the Bush administration to stop blocking private attorneys from meeting with their clients at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In 2004, detainee Salim Muhood Adem had asked for a lawyer to help challenge his potentially indefinite detention without charge by the United States. Attorneys volunteered to represent Adem and requested permission to meet with their potential client. The United States, however, refused the attorneys access for over a year, insisting that the attorneys were first required to provide evidence of their authority to represent Adem. Because the attorneys could not access their client to obtain the authorization, Judge Kay characterized the government's position as a \\"catch 22.\\" Judge Kay held that the Protective Order does not require evidence of authority to represent a detainee as a prerequisite to counsel meeting with a detainee. Rather, the Protective Order requires that counsel provide evidence of their authority within 10 days of counsel's second visit with the detainee. In Kiyemba v. Bush, Judge Kay addressed the same issue as in Adem v. Bush, and held that the Protective Order does not require evidence of authority to represent a detainee as a prerequisite to counsel meeting with a detainee. The only difference between the Kiyemba and Adem was that Kiyemba was filed as a \\"next friend\\" petition, and Adem was filed as a direct petition. Judge Kay found that this was a distinction without a difference with respect to the Protective Order's requirements.Kiyemba v. Bush, No. 05-1509, mem. order (D.D.C. 2006), available at https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scotusblog.com%2Fmovabletype%2Farchives%2F2006%2F07%2F02-week%2F&date;=2009-08-19 The government further argued that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 divested the Court of jurisdiction to decide Guantanamo habeas cases. Judge Kay found that the question of whether the existing Protective Order permitted detainees to meet with their lawyers had no bearing on the question of whether the Court had jurisdiction to review the merits of detainees' challenges to their detention. ===Miguel Tejada's steroid case=== Judge Kay accepted former Oakland Athletics's baseball player Miguel Tejada's guilty plea to lying before Congress in 2005 about his ex-teammate's use of steroids. Tejada told Congress \\"he had no knowledge of other players using or even talking about steroids or other banned substances.\\" However, a Mitchell Report on drugs in Major League Baseball cited Oakland Athletics outfielder Adam Piatt with saying he discussed steroid use with Tejada and provided Tejada with testosterone and HGH. === Jack Abramoff corruption === Judge Kay accepted a guilty plea from Roger Stillwell, a former employee of the Interior Department Office of Insular Affairs, who failed to report gifts he received from lobbyist Jack Abramoff. ===2011 White House Shooting === Oscar Ramiro Ortega- Hernandez appeared before Judge Kay after firing rifle shots at the White House in attempt to assassinate President Obama. === Gyrocopter on the U.S. Capitol lawn === Douglas Mark Hughes appeared before Judge Kay after landing his gyrocopter on the west lawn of the United States Capitol to protest campaign finance laws. === 2015 Thanksgiving White House fence jumper === Joseph Caputo appeared before Judge Kay after jumping the White House fence while wrapped in an American flag.

California, 384 U.S. 757 (1966), was a landmarkAron Hogden, Reconciling A Split of Authority: A South Dakota Response to Recent Developments in Drunk Driving Law, 59 372, 373 (2014) (describing Schmerber v. California as a \\"landmark case\\"); see also Kelsey P. Black, Undue Protection Versus Undue Punishment: Examining the Drinking & Driving Problem Across the United States, 40 463, 469 (2007) (describing Schmerber v. California as a \\"watershed case\\" in the nation's Fourth Amendment jurisprudence). United States Supreme Court case in which the Court clarified the application of the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless searches and the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination for searches that intrude into the human body. Until Schmerber, the Supreme Court had not yet clarified whether state police officers must procure a search warrant before taking blood samples from criminal suspects. Likewise, the Court had not yet clarified whether blood evidence taken against the wishes of a criminal suspect may be used against that suspect in the course of a criminal prosecution. In a 5‚Äì4 opinion, the Court held that forced extraction and analysis of a blood sample is not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.Schmerber v. California, . The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 770. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless blood sample taken in this case was justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if the officers were to wait for a warrant.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 770 (\\"in the present case, however, [the officer] might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threatened the destruction of evidence\\") (internal quotations omitted). In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely that the natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not a per se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.Missouri v. McNeely, 133 S.Ct. 1552 (2013). In the years following the Court's decision in Schmerber, many legal scholars feared the ruling would be used to limit civil liberties.Kelsey P. Black, Undue Protection Versus Undue Punishment: Examining the Drinking & Driving Problem Across the United States, 40 463, 478‚Äì79 (2007). Other scholars, including Nita A. Farahany, Benjamin Holley, and John G. New, have suggested courts may use the ruling in Schmerber to justify the use of mind reading devices against criminal suspects.Nita A. Farahany, Incriminating Thoughts, 64 351, 355 (2012); Benjamin Holley, It's All in Your Head: Neurotechnological Lie Detection & the Fourth & Fifth Amendments, 28 1, 18 (2009); John G. New, If You Could Read My Mind: Implications of Neurological Evidence for Twenty-First Century Criminal Jurisprudence, 29 179, 197 (2008); cf. Kiel Brennan-Marquez, A Modest Defense of Mind Reading, 15 214 (2013) (\\"The modern era of self-incrimination jurisprudence began with Schmerber v. California.\\"). Because the Court's ruling in Schmerber prohibited the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some commentators argue that the decision was responsible for the proliferation of breathalyzers to test for alcohol and urine analyses to test for controlled substances in criminal investigations.See, e.g., John A. Scanlan, Jr., Playing the Drug- Testing Game: College Athletes, Regulatory Institutions, & the Structures of Constitutional Argument, 62 (1987); Commonwealth v. Brennan, 386 Mass. 772, 776-77 (1982) (discussing impacts of the Court's ruling in Schmerber on \\"the breathalyzer test\\"). ==Background === In the 1950s, the Supreme Court of the United States issued two key rulings clarifying the constitutionality of physical intrusions into the human body by police and other government agents. In Rochin v. California, police officers broke into the home of an individual suspected of selling narcotics and observed him place several small objects into his mouth.Rochin v. California, . Officers were unable to force his mouth open, so they transported him to a local hospital where his stomach was pumped against his will.Rochin, 342 U.S. at 166. A unanimous Supreme Court held the involuntary stomach pump was an unlawful violation of substantive due process because it \\"shocked the conscience\\", and was so \\"brutal\\" and \\"offensive\\" that it did not comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency.Rochin, 342 U.S. at 172‚Äì73. In 1957, the Court held in Breithaupt v. Abram that involuntary blood samples \\"taken by a skilled technician\\" neither \\"shocked the conscience\\" nor violated substantive due process.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 433‚Äì39. In Breithaupt, police took a blood sample from a patient suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol while he lay unconscious in a hospital.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 433. The Court held that the blood samples were justified, in part, because \\"modern community living requires modern scientific methods of crime detection.\\"Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 439. Additionally, the Court mentioned in dicta that involuntary blood samples may violate the constitution if officers do not provide \\"every proper medical precaution\\" to the accused.Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 438. === Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule === Until the twentieth century, courts would admit evidence at trial even if it was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.See Weeks v. United States, . Although the Supreme Court developed an exclusionary rule for federal cases in Weeks v. United States and Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States,Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, ; Weeks, 232 U.S. at 394‚Äì96. the Court held in 1949 that the exclusionary rule did not apply to the states.Wolf v. Colorado, . In Rochin, the Court held that evidence obtained in a manner that \\"shocks the conscience\\" must be excluded in criminal prosecutions but the court declined to incorporate a broad exclusionary rule for all Fourth Amendment violations.E. John Wherry, Jr., Vampire or Dinosaur: A Time to Revisit Schmerber v. California?, 19 503, 510 (1996) (\\"[The] Rochin decision applied the exclusionary rule to state courts for the first time, but only where conscience-shocking due process issues were present.\\"). By the middle of the twentieth century, many state courts had crafted their own exclusionary rules.E. John Wherry, Jr., Vampire or Dinosaur: A Time to Revisit Schmerber v. California?, 19 503, 510 (1996) (\\"State courts were left to fashion their own remedies for Fourth Amendment violations.\\"). In 1955, the California Supreme Court ruled in People v. Cahan that the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule applied in California because it was necessary to deter constitutional violations by law enforcement.People v. Cahan, 44 Cal. 2d 434, 445 (1955) (\\"evidence obtained in violation of the constitutional guarantees is inadmissible\\"). In 1961, the Supreme Court of the United States relied upon Cahan to hold in Mapp v. Ohio that the exclusionary rule was incorporated to the states.Mapp v. Ohio, ; see also E. John Wherry, Jr., Vampire or Dinosaur: A Time to Revisit Schmerber v. California?, 19 503, 510 (1996) (\\"A closely divided United States Supreme Court, relying heavily upon Cahan, voted five to four to adopt the prophylactic exclusionary rule in the landmark decision of Mapp v. Ohio.\\"). === Arrest and prosecution === On the night of November 12, 1964, Armando Schmerber and a passenger were driving home after drinking at a tavern and bowling alley in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California when their car skidded off the road and struck a tree.Schmerber 384 U.S. at 758 n.2; see also , Schmerber v. California. Schmerber and his companion were injured in the crash and taken to a hospital for treatment.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 758 n.2 (1966). When investigating police officers arrived at the hospital, they asked Schmerber to submit a sample of his blood, but Schmerber refused.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 758‚Äì59. Although they did not possess a search warrant, officers instructed attending physicians to take a blood sample from Schmerber.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 758. The blood sample indicated that Schmerber was intoxicated, and he was placed under arrest.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 759. The blood sample was ultimately admitted into evidence at trial, and Schmerber was convicted for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquors.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 758‚Äì59; see also California Vehicle Code ¬ß 23102(a). Schmerber objected to the admissibility of the blood sample, claiming that the police violated his rights to due process, his right against self-incrimination, his right to counsel, and his right not to be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures. The Appellate Department of the California Superior Court rejected Schmerber's arguments, and the California District Court of Appeal declined to review his case.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 759, 759 n.3. === Arguments before the Court === Schmerber submitted an appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on January 17, 1966.Schmerber v. California, . In his brief, Schmerber argued, inter alia, that the warrantless blood test violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures, as well as his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office represented the State of California on appeal.Brief for Respondent, Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 (U.S., 1966). In their brief, the City Attorney argued that the blood test did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the seizure was conducted incident to a lawful arrest. The City Attorney also argued that admitting the sample into evidence did not violate Schmerber's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because blood is not testimonial evidence under the Fifth Amendment. Oral arguments were held on April 25, 1966, and the Court issued its opinion on June 20, 1966. ==Opinion of the Court== In his majority opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. emphasized that \\"[t]he overriding function of the Fourth Amendment is to protect personal privacy and dignity against unwarranted intrusion by the State.\\"Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 767. In his majority opinion, Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. held that Schmerber's constitutional rights were not violated when police took his blood without his consent. Relying upon the Court's holding in Breithaupt v. Abram, he concluded that the police did not violate Schmerber's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because the extraction and chemical analysis of the blood sample did not involve \\"even a shadow of testimonial compulsion.\\"Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 765. Likewise, Justice Brennan held that the officers did not violate Schmerber's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable seizures. Justice Brennan wrote that absent exigent circumstances, searches that involve intrusions into the human body require a search warrant. Here, the search was not justified as a search incident to arrest because weapons and contraband are not ordinarily concealed beneath the skin.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 769‚Äì70. However, the involuntary blood draw was justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because if the officers had waited to receive a search warrant, evidence of intoxication would have been lost through the body's natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 771‚Äì72. He wrote that the responding officer \\"might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency,\\" where evidence would be destroyed if he waited to receive a warrant. Additionally, Justice Brennan cautioned that the Court's ruling was limited \\"only to the facts of the present record\\" and that \\"minor intrusions into an individual's body under stringently limited conditions in no way indicates that it permits more substantial intrusions, or intrusions under other conditions.\\"Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 772. ===Justice Harlan's concurrence=== In his concurring opinion, Justice John Marshall Harlan II agreed that the involuntary blood sample did not implicate involuntary testimonial compulsion, but wrote separately to emphasize his opinion that the case before the Court \\"in no way implicates the Fifth Amendment.\\"Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 772 (Harlan, J., concurring). Additionally, Justice Harlan cited to his dissent in Miranda v. Arizona where he argued against a broad expansion of the Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination. Justice Harlan disagreed with the Court's ruling in Miranda and even stated that the case \\"represents poor constitutional law and entails harmful consequences for the country at large.\\"Miranda v. Arizona, . ===Dissenting opinions=== In his dissenting opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that involuntary blood samples violate the right to privacy enumerated in Griswold v. Connecticut.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 779 (Douglas, J., dissenting). All four dissenting Justices wrote separate dissenting opinions in Schmerber. Chief Justice Earl Warren reiterated his dissenting opinion in Breithaupt v. Abram, where he argued that involuntary blood samples violate substantive due process.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 772 (Warren, C.J., dissenting) (citing Breithaupt, 352 U.S. at 442 (Warren, C.J., dissenting)). Justice Hugo Black authored an impassioned dissent in which he argued that the officers violated Schmerber's right against self-incrimination.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 778 (Black, J., dissenting). He wrote, \\"[b]elieving with the Framers that these constitutional safeguards broadly construed by independent tribunals of justice provide our best hope for keeping our people free from governmental oppression, I deeply regret the Court's holding.\\" Justice William O. Douglas also reiterated his dissent in Breithaupt v. Abram, but added that physical invasions into the human body violate the right to privacy enumerated in Griswold v. Connecticut and that \\"[n]o clearer invasion of this right of privacy can be imagined than forcible bloodletting of the kind involved here.\\" Finally, Justice Abe Fortas wrote that the involuntary blood sample was an act of violence that violated substantive due process and that states may not resort to acts of violence when prosecuting crimes.Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 779 (Fortas, J., dissenting). ==Subsequent developments== In the 1970s and 1980s, the Supreme Court revisited questions about the constitutionality of involuntary bodily intrusions in several key cases. In 1973, the Court ruled in Cupp v. Murphy that the police were permitted to extract a tissue sample from underneath a suspect's fingernails to recover \\"evanescent\\" physical evidence.Cupp v. Murphy, . The suspect in Cupp was suspected of strangling his wife and voluntarily went to a police station to answer questions.Cupp, 412 U.S. at 292. Officers noticed bloodstains under the suspect's fingernails and detained him, but did not place him under arrest. Against the suspect's wishes, the police scraped out a tissue sample from under his fingernails to retrieve the evidence. The biological material found under the suspect's fingernails was later found to have come from the victim. Citing Schmerber, the Court held that this warrantless search was justified under the exigent circumstances exemption of the Fourth Amendment because the search was necessary to preserve the ‚Äúhighly evanescent evidence‚Äù under the defendant's fingernails.Cupp, 412 U.S. at 296. Twelve years later, the Court again revisited the topic of involuntary bodily intrusions in Winston v. Lee, where the Court held that the State of Virginia could not force an individual to undergo surgery to extract a bullet that may be evidence of a crime.Winston v. Lee, . The Court applied its previous holding in Schmerber to conclude that the surgery would constitute an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment and that a crucial factor for evaluating any bodily intrusion \\"is the extent to which the procedure may threaten the safety or health of the individual.\\"Winston, 470 U.S. at 761, 762‚Äì63. Writing for the Court's majority, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger concluded that forcing a patient to undergo major surgery intrudes too far upon individual privacy rights and that surgical intrusions \\"can only be characterized as severe.\\"Winston, 470 U.S. at 766. In 1989, the Court ruled in Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives‚Äô Association that warrantless blood tests of railroad employees were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Ass'n, . The Court reaffirmed that the ‚Äúcompelled intrusio[n] into the body for blood to be analyzed for alcohol content‚Äù is a search under the Fourth Amendment,Skinner, 489 U.S. at 616 (internal quotations omitted). but that warrantless blood tests of railroad employees were necessary to \\"prevent accidents and casualties in railroad operations that result from impairment of employees by alcohol or drugs.‚ÄùSkinner, 489 U.S. at 620‚Äì21 (citing 49 CFR ¬ß 219.1(a) (1987)). The Court also concluded that when individuals ‚Äúparticipate in an industry that is regulated pervasively to ensure safety,‚Äù these individuals ‚Äúhave a reduced expectation of privacy.‚ÄùSkinner, 489 U.S. at 627. Because these employees had a \\"diminished expectation of privacy,\\" the warrantless blood tests were permissible.Skinner, 489 U.S. at 628. Justice Thurgood Marshall and Justice Brennan wrote a dissenting opinion in which they argued that this case was distinguishable from Schmerber because \\"no such exigency prevents railroad officials from securing a warrant before chemically testing the samples they obtain.\\"Skinner, 489 U.S. at 642 (Marshall, J., dissenting). ===South Dakota v. Neville and self-incrimination=== In his dissenting opinion in South Dakota v. Neville, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote that Schmerber intended to adopt a broad and liberal interpretation of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.South Dakota v. Neville, (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\\"[T]his Court's opinion in Schmerber v. California [citations] had assumed that the Fifth Amendment should be construed as broadly as the more liberal state language.\\"). After the Court issued its decision in Schmerber, a split of authority emerged in lower courts with regard to whether the Fifth Amendment's right against self-incrimination prohibited the use of a suspect's refusal to submit to a blood test as evidence of guilt.Neville, 459 U.S. at 558 (\\"we granted certiorari to resolve the conflict\\"). The United States Supreme Court resolved this split in authority in South Dakota v. Neville, where the Court held that prosecutors could use a suspect's refusal to submit to a blood test as evidence of guilt, and the introduction of this evidence at trial does not violate the suspect's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.Neville, 459 U.S. at 561‚Äì62. Writing for the Court's majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor concluded that \\"the state did not directly compel respondent to refuse the test\\" and that a \\"simple blood- alcohol test is so safe, painless, and commonplace\\" a suspect would not feel coerced to refuse the test.Neville, 459 U.S. at 562‚Äì63. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall, in which he argued that the Court in Schmerber intended to adopt a broad and liberal interpretation of the Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination.Neville, 459 U.S. at 570 (Stevens, J., dissenting). ===Missouri v. McNeely and the exigent circumstances exception=== Over time, a split of authority grew among lower courts with regard to whether the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception allowed officers to always conduct warrantless blood tests on individuals suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol because evidence of alcohol was being destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes.McNeely, 133 S. Ct. at 1558 (discussing split of authority). States that recognized this per se exigency argued that \\"[o]nce police arrest a suspect for drunk driving, each passing minute eliminates probative evidence of the crime.\\"McNeely, 133 S. Ct. at 1575 (Thomas, J., dissenting). In 2012, the Court granted review in Missouri v. McNeely to resolve this question.McNeely, 133 S.Ct. at 1552 (2013) (\\"[w]e granted certiorari to resolve a split of authority on the question\\"). In a 5‚Äì4 opinion, the Court rejected the theory that the natural dissipation of blood alcohol constituted a per se exigency.McNeely, 133 S. Ct. at 1558, 1568. Instead, the court affirmed the basic principle from Schmerber that absent \\"an emergency that justifie[s] acting without a warrant,\\" police may not conduct warrantless blood testing on suspects.McNeely, 133 S. Ct. at 1559. Consequently, exigency in drunk driving cases \\"must be determined case by case based on the totality of the circumstances.\\"McNeely, 133 S. Ct. at 1556. ==Analysis== Scholars have described Schmerber v. California as a landmark caseAron Hogden, Reconciling A Split of Authority: A South Dakota Response to Recent Developments in Drunk Driving Law, 59 372, 373 (2014) (describing Schmerber v. California as a \\"landmark case\\"); Michael A. Sabino & Anthony Michael Sabino, Warrantless Blood Tests, Drunk Driving, & \\"Exigent Circumstances\\": Preserving the Liberty Guarantee of the Fourth Amendment While Evolving the Exceptions to the Warrant Requirement, 34 27, 68 (2015) (same); Floralynn Einesman, Vampires Among Us ‚Äì Does A Grand Jury Subpoena for Blood Violate the Fourth Amendment?, 22 327, 328 (1995) (same); H. Richard Uviller, Self-Incrimination by Inference: Constitutional Restrictions on the Evidentiary Use of A Suspect's Refusal to Submit to A Search, 81 37, 76 (1990) (discussing \\"Justice Brennan's landmark pronouncement in Schmerber v. California\\"). and a \\"watershed moment\\" in the history of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.Kelsey P. Black, Undue Protection Versus Undue Punishment: Examining the Drinking & Driving Problem Across the United States, 40 463, 469 (2007). Likewise, John D. Castiglione described the case as \\"seminal for its place in the annals of Fifth Amendment jurisprudence.\\"John D. Castiglione, Human Dignity Under the Fourth Amendment, 2008 655, 682 (2008). Constitutional law scholar Akhil Reed Amar identified Schmerber as a turning point in the Fifth Amendment's \\"distinction between words and physical evidence.\\"Akhil Reed Amar & Renee B. Lettow, Fifth Amendment First Principles: The Self- Incrimination Clause, 93 857, 885 (1995). Anne Marie Schubert has also argued that Schmerber served as the genesis for a long line of Supreme Court cases ordering the compelled production of physical evidence.Anne Marie Schubert, Compelled Consent to Release of Foreign Records-Taking the Fifth: Doe v. United States, 23 291, 297 (1989). Because Schmerber foreclosed the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some scholars, including John A. Scanlan, argue that the Court's ruling was responsible for the proliferation of breathalyzers to test for alcohol and urine analysis to test for controlled substances in criminal investigations. ===Immediate reaction=== Soon after the Court's ruling, analysts predicted that the effects of the case would be \\"far-reaching.\\"Wendell J. Willmore, The Implications of Schmerber v. California, 9 26, 27 (1967). Some analysts feared the ruling would be used to justify \\"other intrusive searches.\\"Intrusive Border Searches ‚Äì Is Judicial Control Desirable?, 115 276, 283 (1966). Other commentators also observed that the Court's holding in Schmerber seemed to \\"reverse direction\\" from the court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona one week earlier, where the Court enlarged protections against the police for criminal suspects.See, e.g., Wendell J. Willmore, The Implications of Schmerber v. California, 9 26, 26 (1967). However, in his assessment of Schmerber, Charles L. Berry praised the decision as a \\"successful effort to find a practical solution to the problem of the drinking motorist.\\"Charles L. Berry, Constitutional Law Compulsory Blood Tests Do Not Violate Fifth Amendment Privilege Against Self- Incrimination or Fourth Amendment Prohibition Against Unreasonable Search & Seizure: Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 44 1616, 1621 (1966). Additionally, many law journals also offered commentary of the case's significance. For example, a November 1966 article in the Harvard Law Review opined that Justice Brennan's majority opinion was \\"a good exposition of his view of the interrelationship between the fourth and fifth amendments,\\"Stephen J. Friedman, Mr. Justice Brennan: The First Decade, 80 7, 11 (1966). and a February 1967 article in the Texas Law Review argued that Schmerber \\"exemplifies the proposition that the fifth amendment is not absolute.\\"Charles T. Newton, Jr., The Mere Evidence Rule: Doctrine or Dogma?, 45 526, 552 (1967). ===Impact=== Some legal scholars have criticized the Court's ruling in Schmerber for infringing too far upon civil liberty and privacy.See, e.g., Kelsey P. Black, Undue Protection Versus Undue Punishment: Examining the Drinking & Driving Problem Across the United States, 40 463, 478‚Äì79 (2007); E. John Wherry, Jr., Vampire or Dinosaur: A Time to Revisit Schmerber v. California?, 19 503 (1996). E. John Wherry, Jr., former Dean of the University of Orlando School of Law, wrote that \\"[b]lindly following Schmerber as authorization for all non-consensual blood seizure for forensic purposes is, in this day and age, an outrage.\\"E. John Wherry, Jr., Vampire or Dinosaur: A Time to Revisit Schmerber v. California?, 19 503, 540 (1996). Writing for the Notre Dame Law Review, Blake A. Bailey, Elaine M. Martin, and Jeffrey M. Thompson observed that although the Court limited the holding in Schmerber to the facts of the case, prior to Winston v. Lee, many lower courts relied upon the ruling to order criminal defendants to undergo surgery to remove bullets that may have been evidence of a crime.Blake A. Bailey, et al., Criminal Law ‚Äì Lee v. Winston: Court-Ordered Surgery & the Fourth Amendment-A New Analysis of Reasonableness?, 60 149, 152 (1984). Other scholars have expressed concern that the Court's decision to exclude physical evidence from protections against self-incrimination may one day lead to the use of mind reading devices when prosecuting criminal suspects.Nita A. Farahany, Incriminating Thoughts, 64 351, 355 (2012); cf. Kiel Brennan-Marquez, A Modest Defense of Mind Reading, 15 214 (2013). For example, the Harvard Law Review suggested that the Court's decision may be used to justify monitoring brain waves.Anthropotelemetry: Dr. Schwitzgebel's Machine, 80 403, 409 (1966). Additionally, in an article in the journal Developments in Mental Health Law, Benjamin Holley suggested that \\"neurotechnological lie detection\\" could be used in criminal prosecutions, as long as a suspect's words are not \\"linked with the physical manifestations sought to be introduced at trial.\\"Benjamin Holley, It's All in Your Head: Neurotechnological Lie Detection & the Fourth & Fifth Amendments, 28 1, 18 (2009). Likewise, in an article in the Journal of Legal Medicine, John G. New suggested that non-testimonial evidence gathered from electroencephalography or magnetic resonance imaging may be admissible to demonstrate a suspect's thoughts.John G. New, If You Could Read My Mind: Implications of Neurological Evidence for Twenty-First Century Criminal Jurisprudence, 29 179, 197 (2008). ==See also== * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 384 * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Warren Court ==NotesReferences== The citations in this Article are written in Bluebook style. ==External links== * * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Warren Court Category:United States Fourth Amendment case law Category:United States Fifth Amendment self-incrimination case law Category:1966 in United States case law Category:1966 in California Category:Legal history of California Category:Medical lawsuits Category:Blood tests ","title":"Schmerber v.

It is an important case in studying the impact of the Bennett Amendment on Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, helping to define the limitations of equal pay for men and women. In its rulings, the court determined that a job that is \\"substantially equal\\" in terms of what the job entails, although not necessarily in title or job description, is protected by the Equal Pay Act. An employer who hires a woman to do the same job as a man but gives the job a new title in order to offer it a lesser pay is discriminating under that act. == Background== Wheaton Glass employed men as \\"selector-packer-stackers\\" but employed women as \\"\\"selector-packers\\".

He is known for applying an \\"arrestingly controlled and sleek sense of style\\" to art, portrait, erotic and fashion photography. He has been described as \\"one of a new breed of photographers no longer content to draw a distinction between the worlds of fashion, art, and porn.\\" ==Early life== Cubitt grew up in New Orleans and other parts of the Gulf Coast. He was inspired to explore photography after seeing the photograph \\"Susie Smoking,\\" shot by Nick Knight for a Yohji Yamamoto ad campaign. Cubitt also cites Helmut Newton's photograph \\"Green Room Murder\\" as an early inspiration. He moved north after high school, eventually settling in Brooklyn in early 2000. ==CareerBlogging for Nerve.com=== From 2004 to 2008, Cubitt published a photography/confessional blog titled \\"The Daily Siege\\" at sex/culture online magazine Nerve. It was described by Eyemazing Journal as \\"one of the best sources of intelligent, open sexuality on the web.‚Äù In addition to erotic content, including images and podcasts, the blog featured Cubitt‚Äôs writing on a variety of topics, including politics and his creative process. ===Fashion Photography=== In 2005, Cubitt collaborated on a generative art fashion series with creative coder Tom Carden. To create the images, Cubitt used software that experimented with particles and attractors. The software was written by Carden using the alpha version of the Processing Programming Language, and the images were published in Metropop Magazine. Cubitt is also known for \\"Lagos Calling\\", an alternate-reality fashion story that reimagined the skinhead fashion movement as a product of late-1960s Lagos, Nigeria, rather than London. The images were presented as a set of resurfaced, damaged, faded anthropological portraits. The series was used as stylistic inspiration for the Gnarls Barkley music video for \\"Going On\\". Websites have mistakenly published the images as historical reference. Cubitt created a series called \\"Damaged Doll\\" that featured pornographic actress Justine Joli in a sexual, high-fashion context. Two of the images were included in The Playground, a collectible boxed set of fashion artwork. Two different printers refused to print the pieces due to their explicit nature, so the book publishers printed them manually. However, Barney's New York refused to stock the boxed set due to the inclusion of the two pieces. ===Hurricane Katrina Survivor Portraits=== In 2005, Cubitt traveled to Pearlington, Mississippi, ground zero for Hurricane Katrina, after hearing that his mother's home there had been destroyed. Upon arriving, Cubitt began to document the area's devastation. He set up a photography studio in order to interview and photograph Katrina's survivors and volunteers in Pearlington's former school gymnasium, which was serving as a distribution point for aid in the town. Cubitt published their stories and images on a blog he created, titled \\"Operation Eden.\\" For a time, the blog became a central hub for volunteers and people seeking to send relief, and citizens who were curious about what the mainstream media wasn't covering. The blog has been described as \\"a powerful piece of citizen journalism.\\" It was featured on MSNBC, LIFE Magazine, and Rolling Stone. Cubitt returned to the area subsequently to photograph survivors in Mississippi and New Orleans. His Katrina portraits were used by ad agency Grey Worldwide, in conjunction with SAMHSA and the Ad Council, to create a series of PSAs urging Katrina survivors to reach out for help. ===Celebrity Portraiture=== Cubitt‚Äôs celebrity portrait subjects include David Byrne , Peter Murphy, Xeni Jardin, Levon Helm, Shaun Ross, Big Freedia, Justine Joli, and Molly Crabapple. Cubitt is credited for initially discovering underground South African rap-rave group Die Antwoord, and subsequently shot their portrait and album cover for the band's debut, $O$. ===Video Art=== In 2008‚Äì2009, Cubitt created a video series of Long Portraits, in which subjects were filmed sitting still for five minutes or more. The Long Portrait format became popular on Vimeo, inspiring many other photographers to create their own versions. In 2012, Cubitt created a video series entitled Hysterical Literature. Shot clinically in black and white, each film shows a fully dressed woman reading a passage from a book of her choice while brought to orgasm by a vibrator controlled by an unseen assistant under the table. The first installment in the video series featured adult performer Stoya reading Necrophilia Variations by Supervert, and has received over twenty-three million views on YouTube as of May 2018.

It was founded by Gary Simons, a public-school teacher in the Bronx. During the first year in 1978, eleven independent schools committed places for Prep students and 22 students matriculated from those schools.http://clinton4.nara.gov/Initiatives/OneAmerica/Practices/pp_19980930.6544.html Today, the Prep for Prep community includes over 3,000 students and alumni. There are two sub-schools, Anne Frank and Johnny Gunther Jr. These were named for young people who died from natural (Johnny Gunther Jr.) and unnatural causes (Anne Frank). 42 contingents have been inducted since 1978. In 1988, Prep for Prep expanded its mission to independent boarding schools through the launch of PREP 9. PREP 9 helps the brightest and most hardworking minority students in New York City and the metropolitan areas of Westchester, Long Island, New Jersey, and Connecticut prepare for success at leading independent boarding schools across the Northeast. Current 7th grade students apply to PREP 9 for entry into boarding schools in 9th grade. Space in the PREP 9 program is reserved for students who demonstrate very strong academic performance and high financial need. As such, PREP 9 considers family income and financial assets as part of its application process. PREP 9 started and grew under the leadership of Peter Bordonaro. Founder Gary Simons was succeeded by Aileen Heffernan 2002. In 2020, the Board of Trustees selected Ruth Jurgensen as her successor. In 2000, Prep for Prep partnered with the Goldman Sachs Foundation to establish the New York Metro Region Leadership Academy. According to a report on the Goldman Sachs Foundation signature initiative to develop high-potential youth, \\"The New York Metro Region Leadership Academy (NYMRLA)was established as a program of Prep for Prep to improve academic preparation of promising 12- and 13-year-old students from suburban public schools in the New York metro region. Through a rigorous course of study and an array of leadership development opportunities, the program prepares young people for accelerated and Advanced Placement courses in high school. NYMRLA‚Äôs educational mission is to create a foundation for strong academic performance that will enable students to satisfy the admission criteria of top-ranked colleges.\\" ==Student selection== Each year, a citywide \\"talent search\\" selects about 125 minority students, including 95 fifth graders and 30 sixth graders. To qualify for recruitment, 5th graders must have a scaled score of 330 or above on the English Language Arts (ELA) test administered during their 4th grade school year, or have scored in the 90th percentile on any standardized reading test administered in that school year. 6th graders must have a scaled score of 335 (90th percentile) or above on the ELA exam administered during their 5th grade school year. Applicants then undergo a series of interviews and further standardized testing to determine admission into the program. Fifth and sixth graders are admitted into Prep for Prep and earn spots at leading day schools in New York City. ==Program== Admitted students undergo a 14-month academic course the summer before their sixth or seventh grade year, which includes two intensive seven-week summer sessions as well as after-school Wednesday and all-day Saturday classes during the intervening school year. Courses range from History, Algebra, Pre-Algebra, Research, Latin, French, Spanish, Literature, Writing Conference, Science, which includes biology, physics, and chemistry, Invictus, a sociology and psychology based course, PIMAS (Problems and Issues in Modern American Society), and term paper research. An average of 60 percent of students successfully complete this program and are placed in schools chosen from among three dozen leading New York City independent schools. These 36 schools commit places especially for Prep for Prep students, as well as almost $12 million annually in scholarships. Throughout the program and past high school graduation, students also receive personal and academic counseling, college counseling and career counseling, and participate in leadership and community development activities as well as parties and special trips for alumni. ==School placement== Prep for Prep students are commonly enrolled at such independent schools as Allen-Stevenson School, Berkeley Carroll, Brearley, The Browning School, The Buckley School, Calhoun, Chapin School, Collegiate, Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School, Dalton, Fieldston, Friends Seminary, Horace Mann, The Kew Forest School, Nightingale-Bamford, Packer Collegiate, Poly Prep, Riverdale Country School, Rye Country Day School, Grace Church School, Sacred Heart, Saint Ann's, Saint Hilda's and Saint Hugh's, St. Bernard's School, Spence, Town, Trevor Day School, Village Community School, Hackley, Trevor Day and Trinity School NYC. PREP 9 students commonly enroll at boarding schools such as Choate, Andover, Exeter, Deerfield, Taft, Hotchkiss, Lawrenceville, The Hill School, Loomis Chaffee, and Middlesex]. Many Prep for Prep alumni go on to attend Ivy League schools, NESCAC colleges, and other top tier universities. ==References *Prep for Prep Official Website Category:Education in New York City ","title":"Prep for Prep"},{"id":"20183964","text":"Machakos Town Constituency is an electoral constituency in Kenya.

It is a research university ranked as 45th in the US among national universities by U.S. News & World Report in 2012. ==Foundation and early growth== The Etz Chaim Yeshiva, a cheder-style elementary school, was founded on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in 1886. Prior to its founding, Jewish education in the United States had been limited to supplemental and synagogue affiliated schools. Etz Chaim (\\"The Tree of Life,\\" a reference to the Torah from the Biblical Book of Proverbs, and a common name for yeshivas and synagogues) was the first yeshiva in America; that is, the first full-time, independent Jewish school focusing on the study of the Talmud. The primary impetus for its establishment was the influx of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe that began in the 1880s; the school was established along the lines of the Eastern European yeshivas, which themselves had begun to be established in the early 19th Century. However, the New York school, unlike its European counterparts, also offered some secular education, including classes in English. These were very limited at first, but eventually (partially due to New York State law) became a full co-curriculum, something almost unprecedented in the history of Jewish education. The graduates of Etz Chaim had no place in the United States to continue their formal Jewish education after they completed elementary school, and some began studying Talmud with Rabbi Moses Matlin in his Lower East Side apartment. Soon, in 1896, this group formally became an advanced yeshiva, covering high school years and beyond. Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor, the chief rabbi of Kovno (later the capital of Lithuania), and widely considered the leading rabbi of Eastern Europe at the time, died in that year, and the yeshiva was named in his honor, as Yeshivat Rabbeinu Yitzchak Elchanan (\\"The Yeshiva of our Rabbi, Isaac Elchanan\\"). A year after it was founded, the yeshiva was formally chartered by New York State in 1897 as the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary, which is known to this day by its acronym, RIETS. The first class of three rabbis was ordained in 1903. Despite its name, RIETS began as a traditional Lithuanian yeshiva, not a rabbinical seminary, with classes focusing only on the traditional subjects of Talmud and Jewish law. However, many of the students desired careers as rabbis, and found themselves in competition with the graduates of the Jewish Theological Seminary, at that time still seen as an Orthodox school (it would later become the flagship institution of the Conservative movement), which, while not stressing the traditional subjects, taught its students practical rabbinics, homiletics, and related subjects, making them more attractive to synagogues seeking rabbis. The students of RIETS struck several times in the mid-1900s, demanding these subjects be taught. The board of directors eventually acceded to their requests, and RIETS continues, to this day, to have the somewhat unusual position of being both a traditional yeshiva, preparing its students for the traditional Orthodox semikha (ordination) by teaching a full curriculum of Talmud and Codes of Law, as well as a rabbinical seminary, teaching various practical rabbinics courses. Rabbinical students may also take courses, depending on their intended field of practice, leading to degrees in Jewish studies, Jewish education, or pastoral social work at other schools of Yeshiva University, while others, including those who intend to teach, focus more intensely on the traditional subjects such as Talmud. In the period following these changes, from 1906‚Äì1915, such prominent rabbis as Dr. Phillip Hillel Klein, Moses Zebulon Margolies, and Bernard Levinthal served as RIETS president. Etz Chaim and RIETS, while separate schools, had a close relationship. There were a number of efforts to unite them, which finally succeeded in 1915, when they merged as the Rabbinical College of America. Both schools had each occupied a few locations on the Lower East Side, and now moved into a new building in the neighborhood. Shortly after the merger, the name reverted, for legal reasons, to RIETS, although the most common name used was simply \\"The Yeshiva.\\" As a number of new Jewish elementary schools were opening at this time, Etz Chaim, the elementary division of the yeshiva, was phased out of existence over the course of the 1920s. The first president of the newly merged school was Rabbi Bernard (Dov) Revel. Revel was young ‚Äì thirty at the time ‚Äì but already renowned as a scholar; he had been ordained in his teens in Lithuania and received his doctorate in Jewish studies (specifically, the relationship of Karaite Judaism to earlier Jewish groups) from Dropsie College (now merged into the University of Pennsylvania) in Philadelphia. His wife's family worked in the oil industry in Oklahoma, and he spent time managing their interests there as well for some time after he became president of the yeshiva before devoting himself to the latter position full-time. In 1916, RIETS established the yeshiva's first high school (and the first Jewish high school in the United States), the Talmudic Academy (now known as the Marsha Stern Talmudical Academy). Along with traditional Talmud and other Jewish classes in the morning, MTA (as it is commonly known) taught, and continues to teach, a full curriculum of secular subjects in the afternoon. This not only set the pattern for all Jewish secondary (and even primary) schools that would be founded after it, but was to set the pattern for the Yeshiva as well as it founded new divisions. Later, Yeshiva would establish more high schools, in including the Central Yeshiva for Girls in Brooklyn (the first Jewish high school for girls), as well as another boys' high school in Brooklyn (BTA), and a girls' high school in Manhattan. (High schools, and a higher-level yeshiva, were also founded in Los Angeles, but they are now independent.) In the 1970s, the Brooklyn schools were merged into their Manhattan counterparts, and the girls' school was later moved to Queens, where it remains today. ==Later growth== During one of Dr. Revel's absences in Oklahoma, Rabbi Meir Bar-Ilan, then head of the American branch of the Mizrachi religious Zionist movement, served as temporary president. He merged into the Yeshiva the Mizrachi's Teachers Institutes for Men and Women. The men's school eventually evolved into the Erna Michael College, today the Isaac Breuer College, an undergraduate men's Jewish studies division of Yeshiva The women's school was eventually folded into Stern College for Women. In 1922, Rabbi Shlomo Polachek began to teach at RIETS, being recognized as the top Rosh Yeshiva (teacher of Talmud). When he died in 1928, he was succeeded by Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik. TA provided a college-preparatory education, but there was no college for its graduates to continue their Jewish educations as well. In 1928, the Yeshiva established Yeshiva College, which provides both an upper-level yeshiva education as well as a secular university curriculum, awarding a Bachelor's degree. It was starting at this time that Revel- and, later, other leaders of Yeshiva- began to develop their philosophy of the integration of religious and secular knowledge. Rabbinic education in RIETS, for those who choose it (most of the undergraduate men do not), now continues for a few years past graduation from college, leading to ordination, and continues further for a select few students. The school now became known as \\"Yeshiva College and RIETS.\\" Also in the late 1920s, Yeshiva left the Lower East Side and moved to its current location in Washington Heights, in upper Manhattan. The area centered on 185th Street and Amsterdam Avenue continues to be Yeshiva's main campus, containing the central administration offices, the main library, the undergraduate schools for men, the boys' high school, the rabbinical seminary, and other divisions. The 1928 building, by Charles B. Meyers Associates, is an extravagant Moorish Revival architectural romance of domes, turrets, and towers done in orange stone, copper, brass and ceramic tiles. It may be the only university campus to have been built in the Moorish revival style, a style widely in use in synagogues from the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth century. The Great Depression began at this time, and Yeshiva was faced with numerous financial difficulties, having to shelve its more extensive building plans in order to stay open. (The campus would not really expand until the 1960s.) Yeshiva established its first graduate school, in Jewish studies, in 1936. At this time, Revel began working to bring over from Europe numerous faculty, in both Jewish and secular subjects, in order to save them from the impending Holocaust. ==1940s‚ÄìpresentFirst and second leaders=== The graduate school was named in honor of Revel after his untimely death, at the age of 55, in 1940. Shortly after, Rabbi Moshe Soloveichik died as well; his place was taken by his son, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, who would remain the leading Rosh Yeshiva for over forty years, teaching and ordaining thousands of rabbis, including many of the leading figures in American Modern Orthodoxy today. Revel was succeeded in 1943 by Rabbi Dr. Samuel Belkin, also a European-born scholar, a graduate of Brown University, and a professor of Greek at Yeshiva College. Under Belkin, the institution began to expand greatly. University status was obtained in 1945, and over the following decades, many new schools and divisions were opened. Stern College for Women, providing both an advanced Jewish education and full undergraduate curriculum, was established in the 1950s (its campus is in Midtown Manhattan), as was the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, in the Bronx. Also established, among others, were a graduate school of education and the humanities (now the graduate school of psychology) and a graduate school of the sciences (now focusing on biomedical studies), a school of Jewish music for the training of cantors, and a division providing various services to the Jewish community at large. Belkin set in process the foundation of Cardozo Law School, which opened, in Greenwich Village, shortly after his death. ===Diversification=== David H. Zysman Hall, a Moorish Revival building on Yeshiva University's Wilf Campus, is home to the main beit midrash (Torah study hall). In 1970, in order to comply with laws regarding government aid to sectarian institutions, Yeshiva, in a move that aroused considerable opposition by some, including Rabbi Soloveitchik, officially became a secular university, changing the status of RIETS (the rabbinical seminary), the high schools, and related divisions to \\"affiliates.\\" However, the two-halves of the institution remain very close, both in practice and officially on paper. In addition, the undergraduate schools, part of the officially secular university, continue to require a full course of Judaic studies from their students. For the majority of male undergraduates, this means the standard Talmudic yeshiva curriculum, essentially an undergraduate school of RIETS, along with various courses in academic Jewish studies. As a result of this policy, all of the undergraduate students are Jewish, and overwhelmingly Orthodox. Even in its more secular graduate schools, Yeshiva University is identifiably Jewish: Orthodox law is observed ‚Äì for example, the schools are closed on the Sabbath and Jewish holidays and only kosher food is served. Partly as a result of this, there is a higher than usual proportion of Orthodox students at these schools, although most students are non-Orthodox or non-Jewish. In addition, there are numerous Jewish-related programs and courses of study ‚Äì for example, Jewish law classes at Cardozo Law School. On the other hand, conflicts have developed over the years of the exact definition of Yeshiva's educational and religious philosophy, and whether or not it is (or should be) skewing too far either in the direction of secularism or fundamentalism, these conflicts often arising as a result of specific actions or events. The institution has thus worked continually to maintain the delicate balance inherent in its existence while advancing in both aspects of its character and synthesizing them. ===Third leader=== Belkin retired as president in 1975 and was appointed Chancellor. After Belkin died in 1976, Rabbi Norman Lamm was elected third president of Yeshiva University and, at the same time, president and Rosh Yeshiva of RIETS. Rabbi Lamm was the first American-born president; furthermore, he was a graduate of Yeshiva himself: He received his undergraduate degree in chemistry from Yeshiva College, was ordained by RIETS, and received his doctorate (in Jewish philosophy) from the Revel graduate school. He was, at this time, rabbi in a prominent Manhattan synagogue as well as a professor of philosophy at Yeshiva. Rabbi Lamm took office at a time when Yeshiva was facing a serious financial crisis. As a result, some of the schools had to be consolidated or closed. However, vigorous fundraising efforts ensured the continued viability of the school and placed it on the solid financial footing it is on today. More divisions were added: For example, the Sy Syms School of Business, with divisions for both the undergraduate men and women, was opened in 1988. At this time, many of the undergraduate students began to spend their first year (or more) studying in yeshivot and other schools in Israel, which has become an almost universal practice, and a Joint Israel Program regulating these studies was established to allow them to receive credit for this year at Yeshiva. RIETS also maintains a campus in Jerusalem, and many of the rabbinic students spend a year studying there as well. Over the course of Rabbi Lamm's tenure, enrollment grew considerably, and Yeshiva University's academic reputation rose as well. There are currently over 2000 undergraduate students, with plans in place to add a thousand more. In addition to its undergraduate schools and affiliates, Yeshiva maintains graduate schools in Jewish studies, Jewish education and administration, social work, psychology, law, and medicine; these are generally regarded as highly ranked in their respective fields. There are over fifteen schools in total. In addition, numerous joint undergraduate-graduate programs with other schools in the New York area and beyond are maintained. The Yeshiva University Museum, an affiliate of the school, is now one of the components of the Center for Jewish History, located in downtown Manhattan. ===Fourth leader=== In 2002, following Rabbi Lamm's retirement, Richard M. Joel was chosen as Yeshiva's fourth president. Joel, a graduate of MTA, holder of a law degree from New York University School of Law and a former dean of Cardozo, was head of Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life, which coordinates Jewish activities at universities around the United States. (Yeshiva University has no chapter of Hillel.) However, Joel, unlike his predecessors, is, while an Orthodox Jew, not a rabbi or Jewish scholar but a layman. There was some opposition to his selection at the time from the more religiously conservative elements of the school. Later, there was opposition to Joel's introduction of a new logo and mottos for the school; it was felt that these were an attempt to water down the university's mission of Torah U-Madda, synthesizing religious and worldly wisdom, which is the university's motto and is featured on its seal. However, Joel responded that the logo was meant as a supplement to, not a replacement of, the university seal, and that the new mottos were actually slogans; this controversy has diminished as well. Joel is also the chief executive officer of RIETS (officially known as Chief Executive), but Rabbi Lamm serves as University Chancellor and Rosh Yeshiva of RIETS. While there has never been an official position of \\"top Rosh Yeshiva\\" at YU, and, in practice, there has not been an unofficial holder of this position since the death of Rabbi Soloveitchik in 1993, Rabbi Lamm, since his retirement, holds this title. Under Joel's leadership, Yeshiva University's endowment was invested in high-risk investments, including the funds of Bernard Madoff. Losses of at least $110 million resulted. In early 2014, Moody's lowered the school's bond rating by five steps to B1, junk bond level. To raise funds and cut costs, Yeshiva University has sold off real estate, and transferred control of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine to Montefiore Medical Center. Joel has announced numerous new initiatives and programs. Most notably, he has created the Yeshiva University Center for the Jewish Future, folding other programs, both from within and from outside YU, into it. The goal of the Center is to provide greater services to the entire Orthodox and Jewish communities, continuing Yeshiva's role as the central institution of Modern Orthodox Judaism as well as that of a leading institution of both Jewish and general studies. In December 2012, Joel apologized over allegations that two rabbis at the college's high school campus abused boys there in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Investigations into these allegations by The Jewish Daily ForwardBerger, Paul, (Jane Eisner, ed.), \\"Yeshiva Officials, Rabbis Knew of Alleged Abuse\\", The Forward, 20 December 2012 (issue of 28 December 2012). Via Yerachmiel Lopin's Frum Follies blog.

Naison, a former political activist, was a member of Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in the 1960s. He is a graduate of Columbia University and holds a Ph.D. in American history. ==Early life== Mark D. Naison was born in 1946 in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York.Naison p.1 As the only child of Jewish intellectuals (both schoolteachers), Mark D. Naison had an easy childhood. Although he was happy as a child, Naison felt ostracized from his peers because his parents put such an importance on intelligence. Naison rebelled and turned to sports as an outlet and to help him fit in better with the neighbor kids.Naison p.1-32 ==Early Days at Columbia University== Naison entered Columbia University in the fall of 1962. By the end of his freshman year, he began to feel like he had to oppose racial segregation more actively. By the fall of 1963, he joined the Columbia chapter of CORE.Naison p.38 CORE (Congress of Racial Equality) was a civil rights organization that was pivotal in the United States, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. CORE was started in 1942 and was open to \\"anyone who believes that 'all people are created equal' and is willing to work towards the ultimate goal of true equality throughout the world.\\"Congress of Racial Equality CORE quickly became one of the university's biggest political-action groups.Naison p.42 He signed up to tutor and help organize tenants in East Harlem.Pekar p.59 He earned his BA in American History at Columbia in 1966. and his MA in American History in 1967. Naison went on to earn his Ph.D. in American History in January 1976.http://www.fordham.edu/academics/programs_at_fordham_/history_department/faculty/mark_naison_70075.asp ==Students for a Democratic Society== By 1967, Naison was participating in anti-war activities sponsored by SDS (Students for a Democratic Society). Although Naison was against the Vietnam War, he had objections to SDS's political style. He felt that they were too wrapped up in Marxist thinking and not concerned enough with the human aspect of the war.Naison p. 69 In the spring of 1967, SDS held a demonstration against the Reserve Officers Training Corps, or ROTC, on the Columbia campus. Naison participated in the demonstration, but to distinguish himself from SDS members, he wore his athletic jacket and carried a sign saying \\"jocks for peace\\".Naison p.70 In February 1968 Naison was arrested for civil disobedience at a protest on the Columbia campus at the proposed Harlem site for the new gym.\\"New York Times\\", Feb 29, 1968 pg. 44Naison p 88-95 In April of that same year Naison's father and Martin Luther King Jr. died within two weeks of each other. Both of these deaths had profound impacts on Naison. At this point in his life he decided that he needed to be more involved in radical politics. Two weeks after King's death there was another protest against the gym and again Naison participated. This time it was organized by the Columbia chapter of SDS and SAS (Student African-American Society). Mark Rudd, SDS's leader, urged the group (of almost 500) to seize buildings to make sure their voices were heard. They soon overtook Hamilton Hall, giving them leverage that no other demonstration had ever held. During the building occupation, Naison spoke briefly about the historical context of the march. During his speech he said that \\"the forces opposing university expansion have the upper hand. Let's not leave this building until we get some serious concessions.\\" During the protest, Naison realized that while he did not necessarily agree with SDS's contempt for white protesters, he also felt that their tactics in the gym protest were far more effective, a realization that led him to join SDS after the strike. After he joined, Naison was asked by Rudd to use his knowledge of African-American and labor movement history to argue that the nationalist impulse was a progressive force in African-American life in SDS's leadership's fight against the Progressive Labor Movement. The PLM (generally referred to as PL) included members of SDS who were arguing that black nationalism was reactionary and that no revolution could be built with separate black and white wings.Naison p.88-95 By that fall, Naison had taken on an even greater role in SDS, both in the regional offices and nationally. He participated in many protests and attended the SDS national convention in Chicago in 1969. When the group calling itself Weatherman was instituted at the SDS national convention in Chicago, Naison was there. Naison even joined another member of the group to sign a lease on a house in South Brooklyn. Naison participated in discussions for the Days of Rage to be held in Chicago in the fall of 1969. On a Saturday in October 1969 all that changed. Naison was in a park with a group of friends, and while there they met a group of teenagers. They started talking and soon learned that a caf√© across the way would not serve them because they looked like hippies. Furious, Naison and the others marched into the caf√© and demanded that they be served. The police were called and a fight ensued resulting in eleven arrests. After a couple of days in jail, Naison was released on bail (by his comrades) with the assumption that he would contact a gym teacher at a local school to get the word out about the Days of Rage. Naison did not want to put his life on the line and be back in jail within the week. After tangling with members of the Weatherman, Naison ceased associating with the group.Naison p.106-128 Naison was briefly investigated by the FBI. According to his memoir, the FBI bugged his house electronically and tried to question his neighbors, who, however, refused to say anything about him. After three days, the FBI was satisfied that he was no longer in the Weatherman and they left him alone. Naison lost one of his dearest friends, Ted Gold, during the accidental explosion of a Greenwich Village townhouse by an amateur SDS bomb-making group. Kathy Boudin, in the house at the time, had been one of his favorite contacts in the New York Collective, and she survived the blast. In his grief over the loss of Gold, Naison wrote a poem, published in Radical America, as a tribute to his fallen friend.Naison p.142-143 \\"I remember Ted Gold best... \\"He is dead... Of a bomb meant for better targets...\\" ==Presently== Asked about his arrest during the Columbia incident, Naison replied, \\"Getting arrested to protest Columbia's attempt to build a gym in a Harlem Park was something I was proud of at the time‚Äîand am still proud of now.\\" Naison claims that his only regret in life has been not leaving Weatherman when they started talking about getting rid of monogamy. Naison has been on the faculty of Fordham University in New York City since 1970, where he is Professor of African American Studies and History, Director of the Bronx African American History Project, and has served as Director of Urban Studies. His most popular course at Fordham, \\"From Rock & Roll to Hip Hop: Urban Youth Cultures in Post War America\\", was the subject of an interview with him on National Public Radio. He has written over a hundred articles and published three books on urban history, African-American History, and the history of sports. Naison has also appeared on The O'Reilly Factor, Chappelle's Show, and The Discovery Channel's Greatest American Competition. He has also been an outspoken critic of Teach for America. Naison is co-founder of the Badass Teachers Association, a group dedicated to fighting the Common Core Curriculum and corporate influences on American education. == Publications == * Communists in Harlem During the Depression (1984) * White Boy: A Memoir (2002) * It Takes a Village to Raise a Child: Growing Up in the Patterson Houses in the 1950s - An Interview with Archibald Good\\" (2003) - Published in the Spring 2003 issue of the Bronx County Historical Journal * From Doo Wop to Hip Hop: The Bittersweet Odyssey of African Americans in the South Bronx\\" (2004) - Published in the Spring 2004 issue of the Bronx County Historical Journal * Pure Bronx (2013) - Co-written with Melissa Castillo-Garsow * Badass Teachers Unite!

A friend of Leonard Bernstein and Ned Rorem, he was also active in opera and a frequent guest conductor of the Lake George Opera Company (now Saratoga Opera) and was the founding musical director of the Opera Society of Washington in 1956, now the renowned Washington National Opera. By the time of his death in 1995, he was acclaimed for his great influence on the musical life of the nation's capital. In 1977, Callaway was appointed an Honorary Officer of The Order of the British Empire (OBE) and invested by Ambassador Peter Jay on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II. ==Early years and education== Born in Atlanta, Illinois, in 1909, Callaway attended Westminster College, Missouri, and subsequently studied organ with T. Tertius Noble (1930-1935), followed by studies with Leo Sowerby at the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago and then Marcel Dupr√© in Paris. While pursuing his advanced studies, Callaway was organist and choirmaster at St. Thomas Chapel in New York (1930-1935) and later St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids, Michigan (1935-1939). ==At Washington National Cathedral== On September 1, 1939, Callaway became organist and choirmaster at the Washington National Cathedral, where he founded the Cathedral Choral Society in 1941. During World War II, Callaway was drafted into the Army as a bandmaster in the South Pacific., returning in May 1946. During his tenure at the Cathedral, Callaway expanded the music program's support of American liturgical music and also oversaw considerable expansion of the organ in the 1950s-1970s as construction of the Cathedral's nave was completed. He was quite short in stature, necessitating the installation of a custom-made adjustable pedalboard operated hydraulically so that the diminutive organist could comfortably reach the pedals of the Washington Cathedral's organ. ==Notable appearances== In addition to his principal duties at the Cathedral, Callaway frequently served as a guest conductor at prominent venues. He was a guest conductor of Washington's National Symphony Orchestra and also conducted the world premiere of Gian Carlo Menotti's ballet, The Unicorn, the Gorgon and the Manticore in 1956. At New York City's Riverside Church in December 1962, he conducted the world premiere of John La Montaine's religious opera Novellis Novellis about the Annunciation. Other La Montaine operas conducted by Callaway at their world premiers were The Shephardes Playe and Play of Herode. Callaway was the founding music director of the Washington National Opera in 1956. He played the solo organ part in the world premiere of Samuel Barber's Toccata Festiva in 1960 with the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Eugene Ormandy. On April 17, 1966, Callaway directed the 51-voice choir of the Washington National Cathedral at Westminster Abbey in London. It was the first time an American choral group had sung there and an American flag was raised outside the Abbey for the occasion. ==Works== Callaway's works include The Great Organ of Washington Cathedral, recorded in 1974, An hymne of heavenly love, composed in the late-1930s while at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids., and \\"Hark! the Glad Sound!\\" composed in December 1944 for the Cathedral Choral Society. ==Retirement and death== Upon Callaway's retirement as the Cathedral's third organist and choirmaster in 1977, he was succeeded by assistant organist Richard Wayne Dirksen, the Canon Precentor. Washington Post music critic Paul Hume said of Callaway at the time, \\"It seems incontrovertible that he has had a larger influence on the musical life of this city than any other person\\". Callaway then served as organist and choirmaster at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Washington. He was a member of the Church of the Ascension and Saint Agnes in Washington, where his requiem was held following his death from cancer on March 21, 1995. A memorial tuba rank was installed on the organ of the Church of the Ascension and Saint Agnes in his memory. ==References== Category:1909 births Category:American classical organists Category:American male organists Category:Cathedral organists Category:Westminster College (Missouri) alumni Category:1995 deaths Category:Musicians from Washington, D.C.

When patient experience is discussed in terms of experiences with health care services it is similar to patient satisfaction. However, patient experience is often reported in health research as also encompassing people's experiences of illness and injury outside of their experiences with health services, such as those experiences with family and friends, the influence of illness/injury over their capacity to engage in social activities or previously imagined futures,Bury, M.

Codenamed ' (Waterworks St Pol), it was intended for use as a bomb-proof storage facility and launch site for V-1 flying bombs. However it never went into operation due to intensive Allied bombing that made it the most heavily attacked of all the German V-weapon sites, and also of all military targets in Europe during World War II. == Background == With the Allies gaining air superiority by 1943, different sections of the Luftwaffe ‚Äì which had responsibility for the V-1 ‚Äì debated how best the weapons could be deployed in the face of an increased threat of aerial bombardment. The Luftwaffe's Flak division favoured dispersing V-1s to a large number of small camouflaged launch sites. However, General Erhard Milch, who was in charge of the Luftwaffe's production programme, advocated large launch bunkers. Adolf Hitler was known to be in favour of such an approach, which had already led to the construction of a massive bunker at Watten for launching V-2 missiles. In July 1943, Luftwaffe chief Hermann G√∂ring brokered a compromise under which both alternatives would be pursued; four (and ultimately ten) heavy launch bunkers would be built along with 96 light installations. The heavy bunkers were all intended to be built to a standard design, codenamed Wasserwerk (waterworks) to conceal their true purpose. The first two would be built in the Pas-de-Calais at Desvres near Lottinghen and Siracourt near Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise. The two sites are about and from London respectively. Two more would be built at Tamerville and at Couville on the Cotentin Peninsula near Cherbourg. It was intended that all four would be operational by December 1943, with further bunkers to be built subsequently. == Design and construction == The Siracourt bunker is about long, wide and high, built using some 55,000 m¬≥ of steel-reinforced concrete. Its design and method of construction took into account the lessons learned from the destruction in August 1943 of the Watten bunker while it was still under construction. It was constructed on high ground about a kilometre (three-quarters of a mile) north of the Hesdin-Saint Pol road, to the north of the original site of the village of Siracourt. The bunker was built in loamy soil some deep, resting on a layer of chalk bedrock. The German engineers adopted a new method which they called Verbunkerung, which involved first building the roof flat on the ground then excavating beneath it ‚Äì sheltered from bombs ‚Äì to create the rest of the facility. The bunker would have been linked with the main railway line from Saint Pol to Abbeville, enabling trains carrying V-1s and supplies to enter the body of the structure. It was, in effect, a fortified railway tunnel with a storage area capable of housing 150 missiles and an aperture from which they would have been launched. Although Allied reconstructions imagined a single launch ramp, it is possible that the Germans intended to install two parallel ramps to increase the rate at which V-1s could be fired. == Discovery and destruction == Low-level oblique aerial photograph showing the heavily-bombed flying-bomb assembly and launch bunker at Siracourt (1944). The Allies spotted the construction of the Siracourt bunker almost as soon as it began in September 1943, when two parallel trenches were dug and concreted to form the walls of the structure. Heavy Allied bombing hindered construction but it continued until the end of June 1944, when the site was wrecked by Tallboy bombs dropped by the Royal Air Force. By this time about 90 per cent of the concrete had been completed, apart from the end sections, but the supposedly bomb-proof structure proved unable to withstand the six-ton Tallboy. One bomb fully penetrated the roof and exploded underneath, while another caused substantial damage when it exploded next to one of the walls. The ground around the site was churned up by over 5,000 tons of bombs. By the time the site was abandoned in April 1944, the exterior had practically been completed but the excavation of the interior had only just begun. Roland Hautefeuille estimated that Siracourt was the most heavily bombed military target in all of Europe with 5,070 tons of bombs directed at it. These bombs considerably change the terrain around the site, destroying most of the village of Siracourt. After the war, the authorities quickly abandoned the idea of demolishing the bunker. Before the land was leveled, 80 German prisoners of war removed the launching ramp facing England and partially filled in the interior of the bunker. The Siracourt bunker is still extant today and is visible from the road. It is located on private land. == Air raids on the Siracourt site == { cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"margin:auto; border-collapse:collapse; text-align:left;\\" -  colspan=\\"6\\" style=\\"background:silver;\\" Bombing of Siracourt in World War II - valign=top ! style=\\"width:16%;\\" Date !

Later, as a member of the Weatherman/Weather Underground Organization he used militant tactics to oppose the Vietnam War and racism. After the war ended, Roth surfaced from his underground status and has been involved in a variety of social causes to this day. ==Early years== Roth is the son of a middle-class family in Queens, New York, where he grew up in a progressive Jewish household.Varon 28 He graduated high school in 1966, at the age of 16. That same year he was accepted to, and entered Columbia University in New York City.Salon.com In 1969, Roth withdrew from Columbia to focus his full attention to SDS. Berger 315 ==Students for a Democratic Society== Roth was recruited to join SDS at Columbia University by Mark Rudd and John Jacobs during his freshmen year at Columbia University.Wilkerson 206 In 1969 he was elected leader of SDS when he decided he would not finish school at Columbia and would instead focus on fighting the revolution.Varon 30 That same year he dropped out of school to avoid disciplinary charges and to commit himself to revolutionary organization. He spent that summer working with an SDS community organizing project in the Inwood section of New York City.Berger 98 Roth sided with black students that opposed building the Columbia University gym in Harlem Varon 29 in 1968, which was intended to grant African Americans limited access to facilities and was clearly an act of segregation.Berger 47 Roth also opposed the University's contribution to the Department of Defense in the form of research and military recruiting. These oppositions resulted in a series of direct actions, including strikes and building takeovers. He led building occupations at Columbia University. SDS leader Robert Roth was the contact for the Low library occupation where he noted the \\"great communal feeling\\" of those occupying the library during the take-over.New York Times 5/18/1968 The 1968 Summer session started with protests led by Roth, then a sophomore, Paul Rockwell and Stuart Gedal. On 116th and Broadway, at the university's gates, Roth led \\"liberation classes\\" in which he taught passing students about pressing matters.New York Times 6/11/1968 In September 1968 Robert Roth held a meeting along with other students Josephine Duke, Stuart Gedal and Mike Golash to demand that the Morningside Gym construction stop.New York Times 9/17/1968 Roth demanded Dr Andrew W. Cordier, Columbia's acting President, to end racist and militaristic actions at the university. Roth was part of a group who participated in attempting to force administrators of Columbia University to allow SDS members expelled from school to register for the following term. As a member of the SDS steering committee, Roth chastised Dr. Cordiers for refusing to lift the 42 suspensions for the expelled students, as he claimed it signified \\"an attempt to split our movement.\\" New York Times 9/16/1968 During his time with the steering committee, Roth, along with 200 other SDS members, participated in the capture of Philosophy Hall at Columbia University on April 17, 1969.Subcommittee Report 1975 On April 17, 1969 and May 1, 1969 Roth participated in taking over and barricading the halls.

He was fined $100.New York Times 2/20/1979 After his release Roth resumed his work as a member of the NAS on September 17, 1969. He continued discussing plans for activities in Chicago. The Chicago demonstration was discussed as an opportunity to bring their politics to the streets in order to topple the system. Weatherman had emerged from SDS by late 1969. They sent Roth to Chicago where he noticed the heavy police presence. SDS applied for demonstration permits for a demonstration and march on October 11 of 1969 and held a conference at city hall. Roth noted that the deputy mayor would not commit to providing a permit, but assured the people that this demonstration would happen with or without a permit.New York Times 9/23/1969 In the fall of 1969 the 'red squad,' a plain-clothes Chicago police squad, formed and focused on Weather activity in Chicago. Multiple accounts say that they forcefully entered a Weatherman hide-out and hung Robert Roth out of the window by his ankles in a raid.WilkersonBerger 274 ==Weather Underground Organization== The early months of 1970 saw great change for both Weather and Robert Roth. He recalled, \\"My sense of justice‚Ä¶ and the person I wanted to be were inextricably linked to what happened with African Americans.\\" Varon 54 These sentiments display why Roth joined Weather; he was interested in joining a white movement whose goal was to defeat racism and American imperialism. The news of Fred Hampton's murder in December 1969 provided Roth with the feeling of personal responsibility to make a difference.Varon 157 After his time in Chicago, Roth felt Chicago was a war zone which intensified the necessity of Weather's clandestine activity.Varon 154 In response to Greenwich Village townhouse explosion,where Terry Robbins, Diana Oughton, and Ted Gold of Weathermen perished.

He began singing in clubs in Israel in 1983, when singers like Zohar Argov and Haim Moshe were at the peak of their careers. Here he was discovered by the guitarist Moses Ben-Mosh.Keshet-TV Levi produced his first album, Hafla With Ben Mohes in 1986. He became a superstar in clubs all over Israel. After this he released his first song in the album Ine Ba Ha-yom (Here Comes the Day); then the song \\"Raiya\\" brought him fame. It was at this time that he and Zohar Argov began a personal rivalry. The album was released in 1987.https://www.wsj.com/articles/oud-is-new-for-israeli-musicians-1465403697 Levi's career began to fade in 1988-1991 due to his drug habit. In 1992, he released the album Lehat'chil Mibereshit (To Start From the Beginning) with the hits \\"Rikdi\\" (one of the biggest hits in Mizrahi music) and \\"Mona.\\" Later, Levi released the albums Ha-elam hamudot (Lovely Lad) in 1993, and Mabit mehatzad (Watch from the Side) in 1994, which were less successful, although the first album produced two hits, \\"Ha-elam hamudot\\" and \\"Mi li tomar.\\" In 1995 he released the album Bat almavet (Immortal). The entire album was a collection of Boaz Sharabi covers, except for the title song. This album was not a success and Levi's popularity started to fade again. Then in 1997, he released the album Ha-emuna (The Belief), which again saved his career as a singer with the hit \\"Taltalim shorim.\\" In 1997, he released the album Zirat hayi (Live at the Arena), but this was not a commercial success. In 2000, he released the album Panim l'atid (Face to the Future). At the end of 2000, Levi was sent to jail because he broke into the apartment of his neighbor to steal electrical appliances so he could sell them to buy drugs. He was released from jail in 2003. In 2004, Levi published the album Nativ yisorii (Route of My Suffering). After this album, Levi did a show dedicated to his wife called Ani shar lach Iris (I Sing for You, Iris). Levi was returned to jail after setting his wife's house on fire, apparently because she was not giving him money for drugs. He was released from this jail sentence in 2006.http://www.mako.co.il/tv-people/articles/Article-3b986653e84a351006.htm ==New career boost== In 2008, Levi released the album Rikud romanti (Romantic Dance), which included the hits \\"Rikud romanti,\\" \\"Roze Otach balayla\\" (I Want You at Night), \\"Isha namena\\" (Loyal Wife) and the Arabic hit \\"Ah ya albi\\" (Oh my Heart).http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-4889104,00.html Ishay Levi is the brother of the Mizrahi musician and singer Nati Levi.Keshet TV ==References *\\"Rikud Romanti\\" video on Dailymotion *Ishai Levi songs transliterated at HebrewSongs.com Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Jewish musicians Category:Israeli people of Yemeni-Jewish descent Category:People from Rosh HaAyin ","title":"Yishai Levi"},{"id":"20184272","text":"Lawrence Zeleny (April 30, 1904 ‚Äî May 27, 1995), was an American biochemist most notable for his founding of the North American Bluebird Society in 1978. During his 30-year career with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, he noticed a decline in the numbers of bluebirds. After his retirement in 1965, he began a decades long crusade to save the bird. ==Biography== Zeleny was born on April 30, 1904 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the younger of two sons of Anthony and Mattie Zeleny. For his elementary education, he attended the Motley School in Minneapolis, where he served as a \\"policeman\\" as a ten-year old, shepherding the younger students across the street at a dangerous intersection. After graduating high school at the age of 17, he entered the University of Minnesota, where he graduated in 1925 with a B.S. in chemistry. He continued at the university, receiving an M.S. in chemistry in 1927, and a Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1930. While at university he met his future wife, Olive Lowen, and the two were married on June 19, 1930, shortly after he completed his doctorate. In 1935, Zeleny accepted a position as a biochemist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the couple moved to the Washington D.C. area, settling in University Park, Maryland. He held several positions within the agency until his promotion to Branch Chief of the Grain Division in 1943, a position he held until he retired in 1966. While at the Department, he developed a method for testing the baking strength of wheat, which became known as the \\"Zeleny Test\\". ==Work with bluebirds== As a youth growing up in Minnesota, Zeleny became interested in birds, especially Bluebirds. Even before entering high school in the late 1910s, Zeleny was building bluebird nesting boxes, utilizing a design put out by the Department of Agriculture. He claimed that one of his first memories was that of bluebirds playing in a bird bath when he was fourteen months old. His mother used to walk his stroller every day, parking it next to the bird bath. He furthered his interest in ornithology through a relationship he developed with Professor Thomas S. Roberts while at the University of Minnesota. Roberts had written Water birds of Minnesota in 1919, and would later write the Birds of Minnesota, a two-volume illustrated set documenting the flying fauna of Minnesota. While at the Department of Agriculture, he noticed a decline in the number of bluebirds on the grounds of the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, during the 1950s, after the arrival of starlings, non-natives to the area. In 1955 he built his first nesting box on the grounds, right outside his office. After his retirement in 1966, Zeleny received permission from his former boss, the center's director, to establish a bluebird trail on the center's grounds. In 1967, he began the trail with the placement of 13 nesting boxes in time for the breeding season. Over time the trail grew to over 10 miles and 60 nesting boxes. The nesting boxes were of his own design, although with input from others such as T. E. Musselman. Zeleny felt the key to the design was the size of the entrance hole, which had to be an inch and a half in diameter, which would allow bluebirds to enter, but preclude the entrance of starlings. In 1968 he authored a booklet on bluebird preservation entitled Bluebirds for Posterity. In 1969 and 1970 he spoke in numerous locations, promoting bluebird protection. This was in addition to placing hundreds of nesting boxes in Maryland and Virginia, as well as numerous bluebird trails. Zeleny's concern can be summed up in a letter he wrote to the editor of The Capitol newspaper, in Arlington, Maryland: > The eastern bluebird, one of our finest and most useful songbirds, is in > deep trouble almost everywhere. Formerly one of Maryland's more common > birds, the bluebird has disappeared in recent years to such an extent that > without help its very survival may be at stake. ... the bluebirds are unable > to compete with the starlings and house sparrows that were originally > brought into the United States from Europe and have now overrun the country > in huge numbers. ... The only practical solution to this problem is to > supply the blue-birds with large numbers of starling-proof nesting houses > ... By the early 1970s Zeleny was considered to be one of the country's leading experts on bluebirds. In 1971, as president of the Maryland Ornithological Society, he implemented a program in Maryland whereby any homeowner could register their property as a wildlife sanctuary, which would protect native fauna from hunting. In 1976 he published his first book on the plight of the bluebird, The Bluebird: How You Can Help Its Fight for Survival. Dedicated to his wife, Olive, all the proceeds of the book were donated to the North American Bluebird Society. Zeleny's public profile was greatly enhanced with the publication of his article, \\"Song of Hope for the Bluebirds\\", in the June 1977 issue of National Geographic. That same year National Geographic credited Zeleny with being the major reason for the turn-around of the bluebird species, which had been on the verge of extinction. He was responsible thousands of miles of bluebird trails in the United States and Canada. In 1978 he founded, and became the first president of, the North American Bluebird Society (NABS). By 1990 the organization had grown to more than 5000 members. ==Death and legacy== Zeleny died on May 27, 1995. NABS has awarded more than $100,000 in research grants on studies of cavity-nesting birds. As of 2012, the Zeleny Endowment Fund had exceeded $100,000. Zeleny's bluebird nesting box design is still used throughout the country. Today, he is still credited with the rebound of the North American bluebird population, as well as being the founding father of the \\"nest box movement\\". ==Offices held== * President, Maryland Ornithological Society * Board of Directors, Audubon Naturalist Society ==ReferencesCategory:American biochemists Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:American ornithological writers Category:1904 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Scientists from Minneapolis Category:American ornithologists Category:American male non- fiction writers Category:20th-century zoologists ","title":"Lawrence Zeleny"},{"id":"20184277","text":"China's electric power industry is the world's largest electricity producer, passing the United States in 2011 after rapid growth since the early 1990s. Most of the electricity in China comes from coal, which accounted for 65% of the electricity generation mix in 2019. Coal-fired electricity production declined from 2013 to 2016 coinciding with a major boom in renewable energy, and a decline in GDP growth. China's coal powered generating capacity is expected to increase to 1300 gigawatt (GW) by 2020, from 960 GW in 2016, despite official plans to limit that growth to 1100 GW.https://www.smh.com.au/business/china-to-cut-new-coalfired-power-plants- in-29-provinces-20170512-gw3lj5.html China has two wide area synchronous grids, the State Grid and the China Southern Power Grid. The northern power grids were synchronized in 2005. Since 2011 all Chinese provinces are interconnected. The two grids are joined by HVDC back-to-back connections. China has abundant energy with the world's third-largest coal reserves and massive hydroelectric resources. There is however a geographical mismatch between the location of the coal fields in the north-east (Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning) and north (Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan), hydropower in the south-west (Sichuan, Yunnan, and Tibet), and the fast-growing industrial load centers of the east (Shanghai-Zhejiang) and south (Guangdong, Fujian). ==History== 300px In April 1996, an Electric Power Law was implemented, a major event in China's electric power industry. The law set out to promote the development of the electric power industry, to protect legal rights of investors, managers and consumers, and to regulate generation, distribution and consumption. Before 1994 electricity supply was managed by electric power bureaus of the provincial governments. Now utilities are managed by corporations outside of the government administration structure. To end the State Power Corporation's (SPC) monopoly of the power industry, China's State Council dismantled the corporation in December 2002 and set up 11 smaller companies. SPC had owned 46% of the country's electrical generation assets and 90% of the electrical supply assets. The smaller companies include two electric power grid operators, five electric power generation companies and four relevant business companies. Each of the five electric power generation companies owns less than 20% (32 GW of electricity generation capacity) of China's market share for electric power generation. Ongoing reforms aim to separate power plants from power-supply networks, privatize a significant amount of state-owned property, encourage competition, and revamp pricing mechanisms. It is expected that the municipal electric power companies will be divided into electric power generating and electric power supply companies. A policy of competition between the different generators will be implemented in the next years. South China from the Changjiang valley down to the South China Sea was the first part of the economy to liberalize in the 1980s and 1990s and is home to much of the country's most modern and often foreign-invested manufacturing industries. Northern and north-eastern China's older industrial base has fallen behind, remains focused on the domestic economy and has suffered relative decline. In recent history, China's power industry is characterized by fast growth and an enormous installed base. In 2014, it had the largest installed electricity generation capacity in the world with 1505 GW and generated 5583 TWh China also has the largest thermal power capacity, the largest hydropower capacity, the largest wind power capacity and the largest solar capacity in the world. Despite an expected rapid increase in installed capacity scheduled in 2014 for both wind and solar, and expected increase to 60 GW in nuclear by 2020, coal will still account between 65% and 75% of capacity in 2020. In Spring 2011, according to The New York Times, shortages of electricity existed, and power outages should be anticipated. The government-regulated price of electricity had not matched rising prices for coal. ==Production and capacity== {  style=\\"float:left;margin-left:10px;text-align:center\\" + Electricity production in China (TWh)IEA Key World Energy Statistics 2015, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 , 2006 IEA coal production p. 15, electricity p. 25 and 27 - ! !

A coal shipment underway in China, 2007.China is the largest producer and consumer of coal in the world and is the largest user of coal- derived electricity. However, coal has been falling as a percentage of the energy mix, from over 80% in 2007 to 64% in 2018. Coal electricity generation has also declined in absolute terms since 2014. Domestic coal production has declined even further, dropping 9% year on year in 2016. Further declines in production were announced in July 2016 when the commission in charge of state- owned enterprises, SASAC, ordered companies under its supervision to cut coal mining capacity by 10% in 2 years and by 15% in 5 years. Despite the cuts to coal production and falling percentage of coal in the energy mix, electricity consumption is expected to grow by 3.6-4 percent over 2016 to 2020 according to the Thirteenth Plan (2016‚Äì2020). According to the same five-year plan, coal power capacity will be expanded from 960 GW to under 1,100 GW by the end of 2020 to meet some of the continued growth in electricity demand. In the first two months of 2016, China added 22 GW of capacity, 14 GW of which was coal, according to the China Electricity Council. To curtail the continued rapid construction of coal fired power plants, strong action was taken in April 2016 by the National Energy Administration (NEA), which issued a directive curbing construction in many parts of the country. This was followed up in January 2017 when the NEA canceled a further 103 coal power plants, eliminating 120 GW of future coal-fired capacity, despite the resistance of local authorities mindful of the need to create jobs. The decreasing rate of construction is due to the realization that too many power plants had been built and some existing plants were being used far below capacity. In 2019, reports show that approvals for new coal mines had increased five fold over approvals in 2018, and the China State Grid Corporation forecast that total coal power plant capacity would peak at 1,230-1,350 GW, an increase of about 200-300 GW. The think tank Carbon Tracker estimated the average loss was about 4 USD/MWh and that about 60% of power stations were cashflow negative in 2018 and 2019. In 2020 Carbon Tracker estimated that 43% of coal-fired plants were already more expensive than new renewables and that 94% would be by 2025. ===Hydropower=== Liujiaxia Dam in Gansu The Three Gorges Dam is the largest power station (of any kind) in the world by installed capacity, with 22.5 GW. Hydroelectricity is currently China's largest renewable energy source and the second overall after coal. China's installed hydro capacity in 2015 was 319 GW, up from 172 GW in 2009, including 23 GW of pumped storage hydroelectricity capacity. In 2015, hydropower generated 1,126 TWh of power, accounting for roughly 20% of China's total electricity generation. Due to China's insufficient reserves of fossil fuels and the government's preference for energy independence, hydropower plays a big part in the energy policy of the country. China's potential hydropower capacity is estimated at up to 600 GW, but currently the technically exploitable and economically feasible capacity is around 500 GW. There is therefore considerable potential for further hydro development. The country has set a 350 GW capacity target for 2020. Hydroelectric plants in China have a relatively low productivity, with an average capacity factor of 31%, a possible consequence of rushed construction and the seasonal variability of rainfall. Moreover, a significant amount of energy is lost due to the need for long transmission lines to connect the remote plants to where demand is most concentrated. Although hydroelectricity represents the largest renewable and low greenhouse gas emissions energy source in the country, the social and environmental impact of dam construction in China has been large, with millions of people forced to relocate and large scale damage to the environment. ===Wind power=== Wind farm in Xinjiang, China Wind farm in Xinjiang, China With its large land mass and long coastline, China has exceptional wind resources:Oceans of Opportunity: Harnessing Europe‚Äôs largest domestic energy resource pp. 18‚Äì19. Ewea.org it is estimated China has about 2,380 GW of exploitable capacity on land and 200 GW on the sea.Wind provides 1.5% of China's electricity Wind Power Monthly, 5 December 2011 At the end of 2014, there was 114 GW of electricity generating capacity installed in China, more than the total nameplate capacity of China's nuclear power stations, (although capacity of wind power is not on par with capacity of nuclear power) and over the year 115,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of wind electricity had been provided to the grid. In 2011, China's plan was to have 100 GW of wind power capacity by the end of 2015, with an annual wind generation of 190 terawatt- hours (TWh). China has identified wind power as a key growth component of the country's economy; researchers from Harvard and Tsinghua University have found that China could meet all of their electricity demands from wind power through 2030. ===Nuclear power=== In terms of nuclear power generation, China will advance from the moderate development strategy to accelerating development strategy. Nuclear power will play an even more important role in China's future power development. Especially in the developed coastal areas with heavy power load, nuclear power will become the backbone of the power structure there. China has planned to build up another 30 sets of nuclear power generator within 15 years with total installed capacity of 80 GW by 2020, accounting for about 4% of China's total installed capacity of the electric power industry. This percentage is expected to double every 10 years for several decades out. Plans are for 200 GW installed by 2030 which will include a large shift to Fast Breeder reactor and 1500 GW by the end of this century. ===Solar power=== China is the world's largest market for both photovoltaics and solar thermal energy. Since 2013 China has been the world's leading installer of solar photovoltaics. Solar PV in China is a growing industry with over 400 companies. In 2015, China became the world's largest producer of photovoltaic power, narrowly surpassing Germany.https://www.reuters.com/article/china-solar- idUSL3N15533Uhttp://cleantechnica.com/2016/01/22/china-overtakes-germany- become-worlds-leading-solar-pv- country/http://cleantechnica.com/2016/07/07/china-installs-18-6-gw-solar- pv-2015-connected/ By the end of 2016, total PV capacity had increased to over 77.4 GW, and in 2017 China was the first country to pass 100 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity. The contribution to the total electric energy production remains modesthttp://www.ren21.net/wp- content/uploads/2016/06/GSR_2016_Full_Report.pdf as the average capacity factor of solar power plants is relatively low at 17% on average. Of the 6,412 TWh electricity produced in China in 2017, 118.2 TWh was generated by solar power, equivalent to 1.84% of total electricity production. Solar water heating is also extensively implemented, with a total installed capacity of 290 GWth at the end of 2014, representing about 70% of world's total installed solar thermal capacity.China's Big Push for Renewable Energy The goal for 2050 is to reach 1,300GW of Solar Capacity. If this goal is to be reached it would be the biggest contributor to Chinese electricity demand. ===Natural gas=Biomass and waste=== Hanyang Guodingshan Waste to Energy Plant in Wuhan. ==Transmission infrastructure== Tibet Power is the company that manages power in Tibet, and is controlled by the State Grid Corporation. The central government has made creation of a unified national grid system a top economic priority to improve the efficiency of the whole power system and reduce the risk of localised energy shortages. It will also enable the country to tap the enormous hydro potential from western China to meet booming demand from the eastern coastal provinces. China is planning for smart grid and related Advanced Metering Infrastructure. ===Ultra-high-voltage transmission=== The main problem in China is the voltage drop when power is sent over very long distances from one region of the country to another. Long distance inter- regional transmission have been implemented by using ultra-high voltages (UHV) of 800 kV, based on an extension of technology already in use in other parts of the world.Paul Hu: A New Energy Network: HVDC Development in China, September 2016 ==Companies== In terms of the investment amount of China's listed power companies, the top three regions are Guangdong province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Shanghai, whose investment ratios are 15.33%, 13.84% and 10.53% respectively, followed by Sichuan and Beijing. China's listed power companies invest mostly in thermal power, hydropower and thermoelectricity, with their investments reaching CNY216.38 billion, CNY97.73 billion and CNY48.58 billion respectively in 2007. Investment in gas exploration and coal mining follow as the next prevalent investment occurrences. Major players in China's electric power industry include: The five majors, and their listed subsidiaries: The five majors are all SOEs directly administered by SASAC. Their listed subsidiaries are substantially independent, hence counted as IPPs, and are major power providers in their own right. Typically each of the big 5 has about 10% of national installed capacity, and their listed subsidiary an extra 4 or 5% on top of that. * China Datang Corporation :parent of Datang International Power Generation Company (SEHK: 991; SSE: 601991) * China Guodian Corporation (\\"Guodian\\") :parent of GD Power Development Company (SSE: 600795), * China Huadian Group :parent of Huadian Power International Co., Ltd. * China Huaneng Group :parent of Huaneng Power International (NYSE:HNP) * China Power Investment Corporation (\\"CPI\\") :parent of China Power International Development Limited (\\"CPID\\", 2380.HK) Additionally two other SOEs also have listed IPP subsidiaries: * the coalmine owning Shenhua Group :parent of China Shenhua Energy Company (SEHK: 1088, SSE: 601088) * China Resources Group (\\"Huarun\\") :parent of China Resources Power Holdings Company Limited (\\"CRP\\", SEHK: 836) Secondary companies: * Shenzhen Energy Co., Ltd. * Guangdong Yuedian Group Co., Ltd. * Anhui Province Energy Group Co., Ltd. * Hebei Jiantou Energy Investment Co., Ltd. * Guangdong Baolihua New Energy Stock Co., Ltd. * Shandong Luneng Taishan Cable Co., Ltd. * Guangzhou Development Industry (Holdings) Co., Ltd. * Chongqing Jiulong Electric Power Co., Ltd. * Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial Co., Ltd. * Shenergy Company (SSE: 600642), Shanghai. * Shenergy Group, Shanghai. * Sichuan Chuantou Energy Stock Co., Ltd. * Naitou Securities Co., Ltd. * Panjiang Coal and Electric Power Group * Hunan Huayin Electric Power Co., Ltd. * Shanxi Top Energy Co., Ltd. * Inner Mongolia Mengdian Huaneng Thermal Power Co., Ltd. * SDIC Huajing Power Holdings Co., Ltd. * Sichuan MinJiang Hydropower Co., Ltd. * Yunnan Wenshan Electric Power Co., Ltd. * Guangxi Guidong Electric Power Co., Ltd. * Sichuan Xichang Electric Power Co., Ltd. * Sichuan Mingxing Electric Power Co., Ltd. * Sichuan Guangan Aaa Public Co., Ltd. * Sichuan Leshan Electric Power Co., Ltd. * Fujian MingDong Electric Power Co., Ltd. * Guizhou Qianyuan Power Co., Ltd.

The unit's official designation was k.u.K. (1.‚Äì4.) Tiroler J√§gerregiment, i.e. \\"1st ‚Äì 4th Imperial and Royal Tyrolean Rifle Regiment\\". Nevertheless the name Kaiserj√§ger gained increasing popularity in everyday speech, so that it was and still is universally and solely used. or \\"Tyrolean Rifle Regiments\\"), were formed in 1895 as four normal infantry regiments within the Common Army of Austria-Hungary. Despite the name \\"Tirol\\" in its title its members were not just recruited from the crown land of TyrolTrient, now Trento in Italy, also belonged to the County of Tyrol at that time (including Vorarlberg) but also from other parts of the monarchy.In various sources the percentage of Tyroleans (including people from Trentino) and Vorarlbergers is stated as at or over 90%. But as the First World War dragged on, casualty replacements could only be ensured by drawing on other parts of the monarchy. The regiments were disbanded in 1918 with the end of the k.u.k. monarchy. The word J√§ger (meaning \\"hunter\\" or \\"huntsman\\") is a characteristic term used for light infantry or light infantrymen in a German-speaking military context. == Background == Emperor Franz Joseph I in the parade dress of the Rifles Kaiserj√§ger barracks in Hall in Tirol The first standing troops in the Tyrol were the native Tyrolese soldiers of the Tyrolean State Battalion (') formed in 1703. This was superseded in 1745 by the Tyrolean Field and State Regiment (Tiroler Feld- und Landregiment), which was given the status and prerogatives of an imperial regiment and went under the regimental number 46. Due to the political situation during the Napoleonic era, the regiment was permanently stationed in Veneto ‚Äì still Austrian at that time ‚Äì in 1801, which is why it lost its original name. As its successor in Tyrol, the 64th Tyrolean Rifles (Tiroler J√§gerregiment Nr. 64) was established, based on a Tyrolean rifle corps and the battalion of Kurz'schen J√§ger (\\"Kurz's Rifles\\").Die Tiroler Milit√§reinheiten von 1703 - 1815 at tiroler-kaiserj√§ger.at. Retrieved 20 October 2020. When Tyrol fell to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1805, the name Tyrolean Rifles was withdrawn. After the return of Tyrol to the Austrian Empire in 1814, the reorganization of a Tyrolean rifle corps was immediately begun. Initially it consisted of one battalion, but was later expanded to three. The inhaber of the Rifles was Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Philipp Fenner von Fenneberg (1762‚Äì1824), which resulted in the contemporary title of Fennerj√§ger. == Founding of the regiment == In spring 1815, Emperor Francis I directed the establishment of a Kaiser-J√§ger-Regiment of four battalions and 16 companies. The formation of this regiment began on 16 Jan 1816. By contrast with the J√§ger troops of Old Austria that were organized into independent Feldj√§ger battalions (k.u.k. Feldj√§ger), this new regiment was the only (Imperial and Royal) J√§ger regiment of the Empire of Austria until 1895 (when the \\"Great Regiment of Tyrolean Emperor Rifles\\", or Gro√üen Regiments der Tiroler Kaiserj√§ger, was split up. The soldiers of this regiment, whose strength was 5,000 men, were recruited by state conscription (Konscription) - until the introduction of general conscription (Wehrpflicht) in 1868, their posts were determined by lot - and by the absorption of 1,400 men from the former Fennerj√§gerkorps and of 600 Tyrolean soldiers who returned to their homeland after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Initially conscription service was for 12 years; later, this was reduced to 8 years and then 6 years, the pay of the soldiers being commensurate with length of service. == Organisational changes == For 33 years the organization of the regiment remained unchanged until, in 1849, it was restructured into six battalions of four companies and one battalion of six companies. In 1859 an additional 8th battalion was established. In 1863, another reorganization followed; from now on the regiment had six battalions, each of six companies, and a depot battalion, from which a seventh battalion was supposed to be created in time of mobilization. After the introduction of general conscription (Wehrpflicht) in 1868 the regiment comprised seven battalions, seven reserve companies and a battalion recruiting cadre. In 1880 the regiment was brought up to a strength of ten battalions by the allocation of disbanded Feldj√§ger battalions. By 1 May 1895, the strength had been further raised to 16 battalions by the allocation of soldiers from the Feldj√§ger corps and the Regiment had been divided into four J√§ger regiments, each of four battalions. The newly formed regiments were given the designation \\"1st (2nd, 3rd or 4th) Imperial and Royal Tyrolean Rifles (Kaiserj√§ger)\\" or Kaiserliches und k√∂nigliches 1., 2., 3., und 4. Tiroler-J√§ger-Regiment \\"Kaiserj√§ger\\". The Emperor himself was the Regimental Colonel (or Inhaber); his second-in-command (Zweitinhaber) and the commanding officers were personally appointed by him. == Structure == A Kaiserj√§ger in parade dress On 1 May 1895 the 16 battalions of the Tyrolean J√§ger Regiment (Emperor Franz Joseph) (Tiroler J√§gerregiment Kaiser Franz Joseph) were directed to form into 4 regiments that were set up as follows: * 1st Rifles with its HQ, II, III and IV Battalions in Innsbruck, I Battalion in Bregenz * 2nd Rifles with its HQ, I, II and IV Battalions in Vienna, III Battalion in Brixen * 3rd Rifles with its HQ, III and IV Battalions in Trient, I Battalion in Reiff am Gartsee, II Battalion in Rofreit * 4th Rifles with its HQ, II, III and IV Battalions in Lienz, I Battalion in Hall in Tirol As a result of the usually frequent moves of the garrisons in Austria-Hungary, the units (official abbreviation TJR for Tyrolean J√§ger Regiment) were based in the following towns and cities of the three Tyrolean regions (North, South and Welsch Tyrol) in August 1914: * 1st Rifles *:HQ, I, II and IV Battalions in Trient *:III Battalion and Recruit Battalion Cadre in Innsbruck (Klosterkaserne) * Commanding Officer: Colonel Guido Novak von Arienti :Field officers: Lieutenant Colonel Paul Gschliesser ‚Äì Major August Preindlsberger ‚Äì Major Guido Blaas ‚Äì Major Emanuel Leuprecht ‚Äì Major Maximilian Ritter Barth von Barthenau ‚Äì Major Friedrich F√∂ssl *2nd Rifles *:HQ, I and II Battalions in Bozen *:III Battalion in Meran *:IV Battalion and Recruit Battalion Cadre in Brixen * Commanding Officer: Colonel Alexander Brosch von Aarenau :Field officers: Lieutenant Colonel Friedrich Kreschel Edler von Wittigheim ‚Äì Lieutenant Colonel Viktor Freiherr von Schleinitz ‚Äì Lieutenant Colonel Gerhard Scherrer ‚Äì Lieutenant Colonel Theodor Ritter von Zeynik ‚Äì Major Erbst Devarda ‚Äì Major Johann Ritter von Bezard ‚Äì Major Friedrich Graf Meraviglia-Crivelli :Feldkurat: Karl Drexel *3 Rifles *:HQ, II, III and IV Battalions in Rofreit (J√§gerkaserne) *:I Battalion and Recruit Battalion Cadre in Trient (Kaiserj√§gerkaserne) *:One company in Ala * Commanding Officer: Colonel Heinrich Vonbank :Field officers: Lieutenant Colonel Johann Lercher ‚Äì Lieutenant Colonel Josef Poletiloviƒá ‚Äì Major Ignaz F√ºrmkranz ‚Äì Major August Planiseig ‚Äì Major Franz Bauer ‚Äì Major Karl K√∂be *4th Rifles *:HQ, II, III and IV Battalions in Riva *:I Battalion and Recruit Battalion Cadre in Hall in Tirol * Commanding Officer: Colonel Ernst Dietrich :Field officers: Colonel Ludwig Abendorf ‚Äì Lieutenant Colonel: Lorenz Covin ‚Äì Lieutenant Colonel Rudolf Ritter von Kriegshaber ‚Äì Lieutenant Colonel August Fischer vom See ‚Äì Major Karl Kreiner ‚Äì Major Varius Graf Levaulx Freiherr von Vr√©court == Operational service == Kaiserj√§ger in the Battle of Novara (1849) Medals of a Kaiserj√§ger The Kaiserj√§ger saw operational service at the storming of Casina Fersada on 23 Feb 1849, the attack on the village of Pregasina on 16 Jun 1848, the night battle at Volta on 26 June 1848, capture of a French cannon on 4 Jun 1859 during the Battle of Magenta, the storming of Oliosi on 24 Jun 1866, and the storming of the insurgents' position in Kremenac on 21 Oct 1878 during the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In addition to military combat operations, the Kaiserj√§ger were also involved in the expansion of military as well as civil infrastructure. They are reputed to have laid the Kaiserj√§gersteig road from Levico Terme (L√∂weneck) in the Sugana Valley in the 1870s and 1880s.The construction of several mountain roads is attributed in the secondary literature to the Kaiserj√§ger, although they were only a normal infantry unit and would not probably not have had the technical capability that runs across the plateau of Lusern and the Seven Communities and ends at Malga Monterovere (1,255 m). During the First World War, the four regiments fought with heavy losses, first in Galicia and the Carpathians against Russia, until they were deployed on the plateau of the Seven Communities Trient and at Isonzo after the start of fighting on the Italian front.Further details may be found in the individual articles The orders shown in the illustration and handwritten notes of a Kaiserj√§ger sergeant (Zugsf√ºhrer) bear witness to the operations of the unit during the First World War: This Kaiserj√§ger (later Alpine Company or, Hochgebirgs-Kompanie, No. 30) fought: * in Galicia * in the Carpathians * at Col di Lana * at Monte Piano * on the plateau of the Seven Communities (Lafraun/Lavarone) * at Monte Pasubio * in the Sexten Dolomites * at Ortler * on the Hoher Schneid (Ortler Massif) * at the Tonale Pass (Adamello ‚Äì Presanella Massif) * at the Cima Presena (Adamello ‚Äì Presanella Massif) * and at the Busazza (Adamello ‚Äì Presanella Massif) For that he was awarded the following honours: * the Silver Medal for Bravery, 1st class * the Silver Medal for Bravery, 2nd class * the Bronze Medal for Bravery * the Karl Troop Cross * the Wound Medal for being wounded once (on 20 September 1918 at Zigolon ‚Äì Adamello-Presanella) * the Medal of Honour of the County of Tyrol to its defenders Kaiserj√§ger cemetery in Hijce/Ukraine near Rawa Ruska The Kaiserj√§ger were not mountain troops, but regular infantry. These well-trained peacetime soldiers were regularly sacrificed during the campaign in Galicia and could not be replaced to the same extent. In the Gorlice‚ÄìTarn√≥w Offensive the 2nd Rifles lost almost 80% killed, wounded and missing - on 2 and 3 May 1915 alone they lost 26 officers and about 600 NCOs and men. The 4th Rifles lost 1,300 men over these two days. In the autumn of 1915, the Kaiserj√§ger and Landessch√ºtzen were transferred to the Italian Front in order to support the despairing Standsch√ºtzen militia and small numbers of regular forces defending Italian attacks and to assist in stabilizing the front. A higher percentage (about 40%) of the Kaiserj√§ger were soldiers from Trient (i.e. they were Welsch Tyrolese). The rest were made up of the Tyrolese and inhabitants from the rest of the monarchy.As early as the beginning of the war there were many volunteers from other parts of the monarchy, who joined these highly regarded units. Despite the many Italian-speaking J√§ger, there were hardly any desertions in the fighting against the Kingdom of Italy, although it had been assumed in Italy that their \\"brothers from the unconquered territories (irredenta) strive joyfully in the womb of their Mother Italia\\" (Gabriele D'Annunzio). All the greater was the disappointment when the men of Trentino showed no inclination to change sides. On the contrary, the following saying circulated among the Fanti (infantry) and Alpini in 1916:.. \\"Dio ci liberi degli irredenti!\\" (\\"God deliver us from the unsaved\\").C.H. Baer, Die K√§mpfe um Tirol und K√§rnten‚Äú (Die Parlamentsschlacht und die Winterk√§mpfe) (\\"The struggle for Tyrol and Carinthia\\" (The parliamentary battle and fighting winter)\\", p. 11 - Hoffman Verlag Stuttgart Because of the possibility of unrest the 2nd TJR was moved in 1916 with its garrison (and the recruit battalion cadre) to Beneschau in Bohemia. == Dress == A J√§ger major in parade dress The uniforms of the J√§ger units were the same, except in minor details. A hat made of matte black, waterproof felt served as the parade headdress It consisted of a crown and brim adorned with a circular, green cord, the J√§ger emblem and a plume of black rooster feathers. The hat cord was made of sheep's wool, and had a button and an acorn covered with a green wool. The two acorns were attached to the rear part of the crown. The cord for officers was made of black and gold thread. The crown was in the shape of an oval cone, with a moderately sized dent in the top. The brim was flat in front and behind, but turned up at both sides. The edge of the brim was edged with black, lacquered calfskin. On the left hand side of the crown was a rearward sloping pocket made of hat felt for attaching the feathers. The hat emblem - of gold coloured metal - consisted of the hunter's horn. In the centre of the coil, the Kaiserj√§ger troops had the Tyrolean eagle made of nickel-silver. This emblem was fastened above the hat feather pocket, such that the eagle was at the same angle as the plume. The plume was tied up in the form of a rooster tail on a 1.5 mm thick piece of iron wire. The length of the plume was 29 cm. The plume was inserted into the pocket on the hat, so that the feathers hung towards the rear in an arch. On the march the Kaiserj√§ger wore the infantry field cap. The frock coat (Waffenrock) of the J√§ger was ‚Äì for officers and men ‚Äì cut in the same style as the infantry. The other ranks' coat was made of pike gray cloth and had grass-green epaulettes, shoulder trim, collar and cuffs. The buttons for all regiments were yellow and marked with the battalion number. The shirts worn by the Rifles were of the same colour as the jacket with grass-green gorget patches to indicate their arm of service. Their remaining items of dress were no different from those of the line infantry. Trousers were of pike grey cloth and cut long in accordance with the regulations for German regiments. The trousers of the officers had grass-green lampasses; NCOs and other ranks had grass-green piping along the side seam. The Kaiserj√§ger were often confused with the Tyrolean Kaisersch√ºtzen, who belonged to the k.k. Landwehr, and were part of the regular armed forces of Austria-Hungary. The confusion arose from the decree of April 1917, in which Emperor Charles I granted the title Kaisersch√ºtzen to the Tyrolean state rifles. (The state rifles, known as Landessch√ºtzen or Kaisersch√ºtzen, were mountain troops and wore a different uniform.) == Ranks == One curiosity of the rifle troops was that the private soldier was called a J√§ger (rifleman, literally \\"hunter\\") whereas the lowest NCO's rank was that of Unterj√§ger (unter normally meaning \\"under\\" or \\"below\\"). == Tradition == In order to maintain the tradition of the J√§ger, in 2000 the annual officer cadet intake at the Theresian Military Academy in Vienna's Neustadt was given the title Kaiserj√§ger. In 2004, the 82 graduates of the course joined the Austrian Armed Forces as professional officers. == Footnotes  Literature == * Anton Graf Bossi-Fedrigotti: Kaiserj√§ger ‚Äì Ruhm und Ende.

He worked with many important figures in jazz and traditional popular music, including Count Basie, Peggy Lee, Duke Ellington, and Frank Sinatra. He is also known for his role in packaging and sometimes altering the recordings of The Beatles for the American market. ==Jazz and pop career== Dexter was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. His career in music began in journalism, as he wrote about music for the Kansas City Journal-Post and then for Down Beat magazine in the late 1930s and early 1940s. During this time, he produced an album entitled Kansas City Jazz which documented his hometown's jazz scene, showcasing such talents as Count Basie, Lester Young, and Big Joe Turner. In 1943, Dexter joined Capitol Records, established the previous year, initially writing press releases and doing other publicity work, but eventually rising to the position of A&R; representative. Over the next three decades, he signed some of the biggest names in music to the label, including Frank Sinatra, Stan Kenton, Peggy Lee, Nat King Cole, Duke Ellington, Woody Herman and Kay Starr. He produced the first Dixieland recordings to reach the music charts, and was responsible for the landmark 1944 collection The History of Jazz. He also compiled a series of world music albums, Capitol of the World, which showcased music from around the world, which included over 400 titles from 1956 into the early 1970s. Capitol of the World LPs included German Beer Drinking Songs, A Visit to Finland, Kasongo! Music from the Belgian Congo, and other titles. He also served as editor of the company's own publication, Capitol News. His productions included the Duke Ellington classic \\"Satin Doll\\". Dexter wanted the label to focus more on jazz than on rock and roll and hit singles. In a 1956 memo, he complained that the music business was being driven by the tastes of children, and derided current hits by such artists as Elvis Presley and Guy Mitchell as \\"juvenile and maddeningly repetitive.\\" ==The Beatles== After 97% of Capitol stock was acquired by the British company EMI in 1955, Dexter was placed in charge of screening that company's releases to determine if they were suitable for American release. He rejected most, and Capitol gave little promotional support to those records from EMI that were released. When The Beatles were initially signed to EMI's Parlophone label and began to enjoy considerable success in Britain, Dexter turned down their initial four single releases, believing the group was not suitable for American audiences. He was finally ordered to release \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\", their fifth UK single, in late 1963. In addition, Dexter rejected the following British EMI artists on behalf of Capitol in 1963 and 1964: Parlophone's The Hollies and Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, HMV's The Swinging Blue Jeans and Manfred Mann, and Columbia's Gerry and the Pacemakers, The Animals, The Yardbirds, Herman's Hermits and The Dave Clark Five, all of whom had some U.S. success on other labels beginning in 1964. In a memo dated Feb. 20, 1964 to Capitol Records head Alan W. Livingston, Dexter viewed most of these artists as unsuccessful, praising only Freddie and the Dreamers, whom he signed to Capitol. Dexter oversaw The Beatles' American releases from 1963 through 1966, compiling the albums according to his belief in the different needs of the American market, where albums tended to contain fewer songs than their UK counterparts, and where hit singles were routinely included on albums rather than being considered separate as was then common in the UK. Dexter also remastered the recordings, sometimes adding reverb and altering the stereo picture. The resulting albums achieved great success, but have often been criticized over the years; critic Dave Marsh, for example, referred to Dexter's treatment of the recordings as \\"genuine stupidity\\". The Dexter-produced versions of the Beatles canon were released on CD in the form of the box sets The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and The Capitol Albums, Volume 2. ==Later career== Dexter's blunders regarding the potential success of British popular music in the U.S. led to problems between Capitol and EMI beginning in late 1964, which were exacerbated by his refusal to accede to The Beatles' requests for identical releases in the U.S. and U.K. Eventually, these factors led to his demotion in 1966 to, as he called it, \\"a job with no title\\", and he ultimately left Capitol in the mid-1970s. He subsequently wrote for Billboard magazine; in the December 20, 1980, issue, which featured tributes to John Lennon following his 1980 murder, Dexter infamously wrote an article highly critical of Lennon. His piece, \\"Nobody's Perfect\\", resulted in threats of sponsor boycotts, prompting the magazine to publish an apology and a repudiation of sorts of the claims in Dexter's editorial in the following week's issue. He also produced a radio show entitled Here's to Veterans for the Veterans Administration. While with Billboard, he published an autobiography, entitled Playback,\\"Playback: A Newsman-Record Producer's Hits and Misses from the Thirties to the Seventies,\\" New York: Billboard Publications, 1976 his previous books included Jazz Cavalcade (1946) and The Jazz Story, From the '90s to the '60s (1964). He was a tireless supporter of younger musicians and wrote the liner notes for the Fullerton College Jazz Band's 1983 Down Beat award winning LP Time Tripping released on the Discovery/Trend Records AM-PM label by his longtime friend Albert Marx. ==Tributes== Count Basie recorded \\"Diggin' For Dex\\" in Dexter's honor, while Jay McShann did likewise with \\"Dexter's Blues\\". ==Death== Dexter died in his sleep in his home in Sherman Oaks, California on April 19, 1990, at age 74. He had suffered a stroke a few years earlier. ==References *The Dave E. Dexter Jr. Collection at the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City.

First documented in 1980 in the Pacific Northwest, it is relatively uncommon and can be distinguished from other closely related species by its smaller spores and forking cheilocystidia. Psilocybe cyanescens also has forking cheilocystidia, but less often than Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa. Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa is also distinguished from Psilocybe cyanescens by an absence of pleurocystidia. The name of this species refers to the fibrils on the Stipe (mycology) that turn bluish in age, or when handled. This species is closely related to Psilocybe subfimetaria. ==Description== Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa has a farinaceous smell and taste. ===Pileus=== The Pileus is 1.4‚Äì3.5 cm in diameter and conic to convex to broadly convex then becoming flat in age. It is not usually umbonate. The pileus is deep chestnut brown and hygrophanous, fading to yellowish brown or grayish white when dry. The surface is viscid when moist from the separable gelatinous pellicle. ===Gills=== The gills are adnate to adnexed to slightly subdecurrent in age. It is light grayish, becoming purplish brown with age while the edges remain whitish. ===Spores=== Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa spores are purplish brown in deposit, subellipsoid in shape, and (9)9.5‚Äì11(12) x (5.5)6‚Äì6.6(7) Œºm. ===Stipe=== The stipe is 3‚Äì8 cm long and 0.5 cm thick. It has an equal structure only enlarging near the base. The stipe is striate, pallid to yellow brown with fine fibrils that stain blue when handled. The stipe has a cortina that sometimes leaves a fragile annular zone. White rhizomorphs are at the base. The flesh is brownish and bruises bluish to indigo-black. ===Microscopic features=== Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa basidia each produce four spores, and rarely only two spores. The cheilocystidia are fusiform to lanceolate and 22‚Äì33 x 5.5‚Äì7 Œºm, with an elongated, forking neck and are 1‚Äì1.5 Œºm thick at its apex. Pleurocystidia are absent in Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa. ==Habitat and formation== Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa is found growing scattered to gregarious, from September to December from Northern California to British Columbia, Canada. It is found in soils enriched with deciduous wood debris, among bush lupines, in Alder and Willow wood chips and bark mulch, Fir sawdust, in coastal regions, in rhododendron gardens and nurseries, and in flood plains in river estuaries. ==Chemistry== Both psilocybin and psilocin (0.05 mg per gram dry weight and 1.4 mg per gram psilocin) were detected by Beug and Bigwood. ==References== * Stamets PE, Beug MW, Bigwood JE, Guzm√°n G.

It was the first full colour South Asian glossy magazine of its kind in Canada. Their idea was simply to produce a periodical that would not only showcase the community to its own, but also provide a tool and a bridge to foster better cross-cultural harmony and understanding. The word \\"Mehfil\\" means \\"a gathering\\". During its run, Mehfil Magazine featured the South Asian community‚Äôs leading business men and women, writers, artists, social workers, law enforcement, politicians and students. It also tackled some of the South Asian community‚Äôs toughest social and political issues, including the Air India bombing, sexual abuse, arranged marriages, health concerns such as diabetes, the plight of seniors, as well as the cultural challenges of a new generation trying to integrate. The magazine ceased publication in 2010. ==Notable Contributors== Rick Hansen, Guest columnist Mehfil Magazine April/May 1998 Peter C.

The Siamese coup d'√©tat of 1947 (Thai: ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ê‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£ 8 ‡∏û‡∏§‡∏®‡∏à‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏ô ‡∏û.‡∏®. 2490) was a Thai coup d'√©tat that took place on the evening of 7 November 1947, ending in the early morning hours of 8 November. The coup ousted the government of Rear Admiral Thawan Thamrongnawasawat, who was replaced by Khuang Aphaiwong as Prime Minister of Thailand. The coup was led by Lieutenant-General Phin Chunhawan and Colonel Kat Katsongkhram. ==Background== On 1 August 1944, as the Allies were winning the Second World War, the pro- Japanese strongman Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram {better known in the West as \\"Phibun\\") was forced by parliament to resign his premiership. He was replaced by Khuang Aphaiwong, a civilian who had the backing of Pridi Phanomyong, regent for the absent King Ananda Mahidol and head of the Seri Thai underground resistance. For the next three years civilian cabinets, led behind the scenes by Pridi, governed the kingdom. For a brief while the various elements of the anti-Phibun coalition ‚Äì Pridi and his supporters in the bureaucracy, politicians from the northeast, and conservative royalists ‚Äì retained their unity. All hoped to see constitutional government succeed, and all feared a resurgence of the military. Having established a civilian government, Khuang resigned in August 1945 to make way for a better qualified person to negotiate with the allies. The most obvious choice was the leader of the US-supported Seri Thai, Seni Pramot, who Pridi invited to become prime minister.Royal Thai Government Gazette, Vol. 62, 11 October 1945 In January 1946, Seni resigned and asked for the dissolution of parliament to pave the way for elections. Khuang and his new royalist allies were elected to power. But because Pridi chose to support Direk Chaiyanam as his personal candidate, Khuang included none of the former regent's allies in his cabinet, but placed many of his opponents, including Seni. Pridi's followers immediately sought revenge, continually harassing the government, further intensifying the bitterness between themselves and the conservatives. Within six weeks Khuang abruptly resigned, forcing Pridi to reluctantly step in and risk his personal prestige. Up until the resignation of his wartime ally, Pridi had enjoyed the prestige of his position as a senior statesman without having to involve himself in everyday politics. Pridi's failure to control inflation tarnished his reputation for competence, while official corruption bedeviled his governments. On 9 June 1946, the 20 year-old King Ananda Mahidol, who had restored popularity to the monarchy, was found dead in his bedroom of a gunshot wound to the head. Khuang, Seni, and the royalists who dominated their newly formed Democrat Party were quick to blame Pridi, spreading the rumour that the prime minister and his supporters had assassinated the monarch for their own political purposes and possibly to establish a republic. Conservative newspapers criticised the government for failing to protect the monarch, provoking Pridi to use repressive measures: he declared a state of emergency, censored newspapers, and arrested two editors and two opposition MPs. In an attempt to preserve his political influence, Pridi resigned on 21 August 1946. He was replaced five days later by Rear Admiral Thamrong, who would serve as Pridi's front man. ===Prelude=== Rear Admiral Thamrong‚Äôs government was soon engulfed in scandals. Thamrong privately confided to US Ambassador Edwin F. Stanton that the evidence gathered during investigations of the regicide implicated King Bhumibol in the late king's death.American Embassy Bangkok, \\"Confidential Memorandum of Discussion between Prime Minister Luang Thamrong Nawasawat and Ambassador Edwin F. Stanton\\", , 31 March 1948 In a declassified US State Department memo, Ambassador Stanton noted: \\"Luang Thamrong said speaking quite confidentially the evidence which was accumulated while he was Prime Minister tended to implicate the present young King, but that he would never have dared to hint by any official action that such was the case.\\" Luang Thamrong noted that Bhumibol would probably abdicate if it was revealed that he was involved in the regicide and that this would cause \\"confusion and wild intrigue\\". Those next in the line of succession to the throne, Prince Chumbhotbongs Paribatra and Prince Bhanubandhu Yugala, were both unpopular and he thought they would probably not be able to ascend to the throne. Luang Thamrong doubted whether the murder would ever be cleared up inasmuch as he felt Siam could not dispense with the monarchy. Thamrong's government was also faced with charges of corruption, stemming from a government program to hand out free shovels and spades to rural farmers. The farming equipment brought and handed out was sub-standard, leading to charges of corruption and embezzlement by the public. The scandal became known as the \\"eating from shovels scandal\\" (Thai:‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏à‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏°). This, and other scandals, led to a debate, called for by the Democrats, and a vote of no confidence, which Thamrong survived. When asked by a journalist the prime minister joked that he was, \\"already sleeping for a coup\\" [Google translate: \\"Alreading lying in wait for the revolution.\\"] (Thai: \\"‡∏Å‡πá‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏õ‡∏è‡∏¥‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏π‡πà‡πÅ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏ß\\"), confident at the time that he had the backing of the military, especially the army. He was wrong. ===The plotters=== The coup was led by Lieutenant General Phin Choonhavan and Colonel Kard Kardsonggram. Other members of the group were: Police General Phao Sriyanond (Thai: ‡πÄ‡∏ú‡πà‡∏≤ ‡∏®‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏ó‡πå), Colonel Sarit Dhanarajata (Thai: ‡∏™‡∏§‡∏©‡∏î‡∏¥‡πå ‡∏ò‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ä‡∏ï‡πå), Colonel Thanom Kittikachorn (Thai: ‡∏ñ‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏° ‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏Ç‡∏à‡∏£), and Lieutenant Colonel Praphas Charusathien (Thai: ‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏™ ‡∏à‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏∏‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏ñ‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏£), Captain Chatichai Choonhavan (Thai: ‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏¢ ‡∏ä‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏´‡∏∞‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ì) (the leader‚Äôs son). They called themselves the \\"National Soldier's Committee\\" (Thai: ‡∏Ñ‡∏ì‡∏∞‡∏ó‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÅ‡∏´‡πà‡∏á‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¥). ==The coup== The plotters planned the coup to begin at 05:00 on 8 November. Their plot, however, was discovered days earlier by the commander-in-chief of the army who, in an effort to thwart the attempt, ordered all senior officers to report for duty at army headquarters immediately. The plotters accordingly changed their plan to start the coup at 23:00 on 7 November instead. They began by sending a squadron of tanks to Amphorn Gardens (Thai: ‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏±‡∏°‡∏û‡∏£) near the centre of government. They immediately arrested Prime Minister Thamrong and held him hostage. Another tank squadron went to search for Pridi. After arriving at his riverside residence they found that he has escaped (he was told of the plot beforehand by an informant), leaving only his wife and children who were arrested. Unbeknownst to them, Pridi was hiding under the protection of Admiral Luang Sinthusongkramchai (Thai: ‡∏´‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏™‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏∏‡∏™‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏ä‡∏±‡∏¢), commander of the Royal Thai Navy at his base. On the morning of 8 November, General Choonhavan read a declaration to the press and broadcast by radio outlining the plotter's reasoning. They claimed they were right to remove the government as people were suffering under high prices and the general lack of foods and goods. This they considered a grievous lack of competence by the government. Finally they reckoned that the government was unable to solve the problem and must be removed by force. During the speech he cried profusely and was dubbed sarcastically by the press as the \\"hero of tears\\" (Thai: ‡∏ß‡∏µ‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏©‡πÄ‡∏à‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏ï‡∏≤), or the \\"crying patriot\\" (Thai: ‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏∏‡∏©‡∏ú‡∏π‡πâ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏à‡∏ô‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏ï‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏´‡∏•). The National Soldier's Committee then called for Khuang, the Leader of the Opposition to take over as prime minister. He assumed the position on 12 November, becoming prime minister for the third time. The committee set up their own legislative assembly called the \\"Council of Ministers of the Assembly\\" (Thai: ‡∏Ñ‡∏ì‡∏∞‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ê‡∏°‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏™‡∏†‡∏≤), making a deal with Khaung that, if he stayed out of their business, they would stay out of his. On 25 November 1947, Prince Rangsit of Chainant the Regent of Siam signed a provisional charter or the Constitution of 1947. King Bhumibol, who was studying in Lausanne, Switzerland at the time endorsed him. On 29 January 1948 elections were held in which Khuang and his party won the majority of the votes and seats in the new assembly. Later Khuang was confirmed as prime minister. But on 6 April, the committee, under the leadership of Kardsonggram, forced Khuang to resign his post. They instead invited Field Marshal Phibun to return to the post. He became prime minister for the second time on 8 April 1948. ==Legacy== Pridi escaped the plotters and went into exile, never to return. The most obvious legacy of the coup was the reinstatement of Phibun and his dictatorship. The coup also increased the role of the Royal Thai Army, and gave it a model of how to carry out coups in the future. Henceforth, under the pretext of saving the nation, the military would topple any democratic government it pleased. The coup elicited little response from the populace. The Democrat Party remained in opposition until 1975. Phibun would resume his dictatorship and rule until 1957. The plotters from then on were known as the Coup Group. The coup inadvertently led to the draft and signing of the 1949 Constitution. The most Royalist constitution to date, it gave the monarchy back almost all of the powers that were taken away from it by the 1932 Revolution. The coup also brought an end to Pridi's career and any dreams his supporters might have of his resuming the premiership. On 20 November 1948 Pridi was spirited out of the country by British and American agents never to return to Thailand. He died in Paris in 1983, aged 83. The coup proved to be a stepping stone for three individuals involved, whose names would later become common in the politics of Thailand. They would all become prime ministers and two of them would go on to one day lead coups of their own. They were, Sarit Dhanarajata, Thanom Kittikachorn, and Chatichai Choonhavan. ==See also== * 1947 Coup Group (Thailand) * Military of Thailand * Politics of Thailand * History of Thailand (1932‚Äì1973) ==References== Category:Military coups in Thailand Category:Political history of Thailand Category:Conflicts in 1947 Category:1947 in Thailand Thailand Category:Rebellions in Thailand ","title":"Siamese coup d'√©tat of 1947"},{"id":"20184605","text":"Sk√´nderbegas is a village and a former municipality in the Elbasan County, central Albania.

The community is accessible via an unpaved road, Route 438, which branches off of Route 432 near the community of Main Brook. Near the community is an abandoned copper mine which has been recently re-discovered with potential new mining quantities. During King George's War, the village was attacked in the Newfoundland Campaign (1744). St. Julien Island appears on the earliest maps of Newfoundland. The French fished in the area as early as the 1500s. Along with the nearby harbours of Grandois and St. Julien, this was a popular destination for French vessels because of its close proximity to the administrative headquarters at Croque. Grandois, pronounced GRAND-swah, comes from the French Les Grandes Oyes, meaning Great Geese. Bricks from French bread ovens, gravesites and engravings have been found throughout the area. In 1822, the French hired George McGrath as the guardian of their fishing premises during the winter months. By 1857 other settlers had appeared, and after 1874, the French had moved most of their fishing operations farther north. The permanent population of Grandois and St. Julien‚Äôs never surpassed 135 people and by the 1980s the smaller harbours had been vacated, with some of the people moving to Grandois. The fish plant by the government wharf operated until 1992 when the provincial fishing moratorium ended the 400-year tradition of inshore fishing in the region.

Some segments included the clubbing of seals on the Pribilof Islands, the effect of DDT on brown pelican populations in Texas, and the plight of severely endangered animals. In one segment, various species were shown, with the narration reciting how many animals were left in the world. Included were black footed ferrets, prairie chickens, and many more. One was the Japanese Crested Ibis. A small flock of the bright white birds was seen from overhead against the backdrop of a beautiful, verdant forest.

It was built in the year 3BC for irrigation purposes and supplying water for the newly founded colony of Augusta Praetoria, which is now known as Aosta. The water was directed through a neighbouring valley 66 m above the floor of the Aosta valley, through a sophisticated system. The aqueduct is 6km long in total. In addition to its unusual position, the construction, which was originally thought to be a three-story structure, shows more unique features such as a control corridor below the water line, as well as explicit private funding. Today, the water channel of the aqueduct serves as a public walking trail. Besides the Pont d'A√´l, two other Roman bridges in the Aosta valley are still intact: the Pont-Saint-Martin in the town of the same name and the Pont de Pierre in Aosta. ==Research and function== The bridge traverses the Grand Eyvia river at Pont d‚ÄôA√´l next to the entrance to the Cogne Valley, 8 km West of Aosta. Pingone recorded the first description, along with a sketch in the year 1550. Further illustrations were contributed by Baron de Malzen in 1826 and Aubert in 1860, which already showed the construction in its present form. Barocelli added measurements from 1864 after excavations on the eastern edge of the bridge in 1930. A complete survey and documentation was first carried out in 1996 by Mathias D√∂ring. Here it was discovered that the bridge was used to transport iron ore, as previously thought, but belonged to the growing colony of Augusta Praetoria Salassorum (modern Aosta), used as an irrigation pipeline for agricultural land and a washery for the iron ore in Cogne. The idea of it being a water supply for Augusta Praetoria was ruled out, because the town itself is supplied from the nearby river Buthier. Nevertheless, the water may have also been used, in addition to its main economic function, to meet local drinking water needs. ==Irrigation line== One end of the 6km long pipeline opened onto a 200 hectare farm situated in west Aosta, 50 to 150 m above the main river Dora Baltea using a gradient line from the neighbouring valley. On the way the water was diverted for ore washing, probably located near the village of Aymavilles. The technical difficulties in laying the pipeline along the steep rock faces of the Cogne valley were solved by the Roman engineers by using a gravity pipeline. The water from the Grand Eyvia, which is diverted 2.9km above the Pont d‚ÄôA√´l, was directed downhill onto the steep slopes of the Cogne valley in open channels with an average gradient of 6.6 per mille. Tunnels or qanats were formed due to the hard rockface. The line was cut as a half-gallery in the rocky slope, so that a parapet, up to 3 m high, was formed that ended in the bedrock on the valley side. The advantage of this method was that unlike a normal tunneling process, the tunneling work could start at any number of points because it was easily visible. This meant there was a significant decrease in the construction time. Such half-galleries in Roman engineering can only be found rarely in particularly rough terrain, such as at the water line of Side in Turkey. In the flatter areas they decided on a two to four meter wide terrace, through which the line ran as a rectangular brick canal with cover tiles. Overall the line traverses 2.25 km down a slope and then 0.6km down a rocky path to Pont d'A√´l. The other pipeline underneath the bridge could not be investigated because of construction and agricultural use; the end point could possibly be situated in the said irrigation zone in what is today known as the village of Aymavilles. == Construction== The and bridge is the only possible crossing point over the and up to canyon of the Grand Eyvia. Its only arch spans the gorge, which here is only 12 m wide but 66 m deep, with a span of 14.24 m. The bridge arch consists of a single key stone. On the lower floor of the bridge, which was once probably three stories high, a corridor served to verify the density of the overlying water pipe in antiquity. On both sides of this control corridor there are two rows of small windows from which the lower floor and the upper ceiling are illuminated so that the bridge keeper could quickly identify leaking water, which could have damaged the stonework with frost. D√∂ring was able to prove beyond reasonable doubt the existence of the ancient aqueduct, where the trail runs today, on the basis of the altitude and course of the preserved remains of the walls, as well as a subsequent tunnel west of the bridge. It was 1.90 m high and 1.0 m wide. At the time the third floor was possibly an open walkway, which gave the building a total height of 22.15 m. == Bridge inscription == :IMP CAESARE AVGVSTO XIII COS DESIG :C AVILLIVS C F CAIMVS PATAVINVS :PRIVATVM Completed: :Imperatore Caesare Augusto XIII consule designato :Gaius Avillius Gaii filius Caimus Patavinus :privatum Translated: :\\"When emperor Caesare Augustus was consul for the 13th time\\" :\\"Caius Avillius Caimus from Padua, son of Caius, [built this bridge]\\" :\\"using private funds\\" == Sources == * * == See also == * Roman bridge * List of Roman bridges * Roman architecture * Roman engineering == External links == * Mathias D√∂ring: Roman Irrigation Aqueduct in Aosta/Italy * Pont d'A√´l : le pont-aqueduc romain * Aqueduc.info: L‚Äôhistoire d‚Äôun aqueduc devenu chemin muletier Category:Roman bridges in Italy Category:Deck arch bridges Category:Stone bridges in Italy Category:Bridges completed in the 1st century BC Category:Bridges in Aosta Valley Category:Roman aqueducts outside Rome Category:0s BC establishments ","title":"Pont d'A√´l"},{"id":"20184671","text":"Moabit Courthouse, Turmstra√üe 91 Moabit Hospital, Haupteingang Turmstra√üe 21/22 Turmstra√üe (Tower street) is a main street in the Berlin district of Moabit.

St Aubin's Bay, 1933 ==History== Jersey Airways Limited was formed by Walter Thurgood on 9 December 1933. The first commercial service took place on 18 December; a passenger service from Jersey to Portsmouth. In the absence of a proper airport, the aircraft used St. Aubin's beach at West Park, St. Helier, and the airline had its maintenance base at Portsmouth Airport, (moving to Southampton Airport in 1935). On Sunday, 28 January 1934, the first flights began from Heston Aerodrome in Middlesex (with a special bus connection from London) to Jersey, in March 1934 flights began from Southampton, and during summer 1934, a service was operated to Paris. In its first full year, Jersey Airways carried 20,000 passengers, using a fleet of eight de Havilland DH.84 Dragons, each capable of carrying eight passengers.Doyle (1991) On 1 December 1934, Channel Islands Airways was registered as a holding company for Jersey Airways Ltd. and its subsidiary Guernsey Airways Ltd. which had been formed a week earlier. Shares were bought by the Great Western Railway and the Southern Railway. This allowed expansion, and in 1935, six four-engined de Havilland DH.86 Expresses and two de Havilland Dragon Rapides were introduced to replace the Dragons. On 8 January 1935, a service began to Rennes in France, although on 29 March 1935 it ceased. In April 1936, a Plymouth-Jersey service began, and in 1938 to Exeter, Dinard and Shoreham. Jersey Airport opened on 10 March 1937, and Jersey Airways was able to operate a fixed timetable that no longer depended on the state of the tides. This also meant the company obtained the mail-carrying contract, freight traffic increased, and night flights could begin. Meanwhile, in Guernsey, things were at a less advanced stage, and most air services were those by flying boats and amphibians. Guernsey Airways was very much smaller than its sister company in Jersey. Two flying boats were used: Saro Windhover G-ABJP and Saro Cloud G-ABXW, named \\"Cloud of Iona\\". In May 1939, Guernsey's new airport was opened. On 8 May 1939, Guernsey Airways began a service to Southampton, using a DH.86A (G-ADVK) and a DH.86B (G-AENR), later joined by a DH.95 Flamingo (G-AFUF). In June 1939, the prototype Flamingo (G-AFUE) was evaluated by Jersey Airways, but further orders for the type were frustrated by world events. At the outbreak of war on 3 September 1939, flights to the Channel Islands ceased. In November 1939, services resumed from Shoreham, under the direction of National Air Communications. On 13 June 1940, all scheduled air services between the United Kingdom and the Channel Islands were suspended. The following day, Jersey Airways began flying its staff and equipment to the United Kingdom mainland, and on 18‚Äì19 June 1940, the DH.86 fleet was used to evacuate 320 islanders to the mainland, before German forces occupied the islands on 1 July 1940. One DH.86 (G-ADVK) was on overhaul at Jersey at the time, and was abandoned; the rest of the fleet was impressed into RAF service.Jackson 1974, pp. 130-134, 455-457 Following the liberation of the islands in 1945, Channel Islands Airways resumed scheduled services in June 1945, using ex-RAF DH.89A Dragon Rapides. Jersey Airways and Guernsey Airways flights then terminated at Southampton and at Croydon Airport. In May 1946, a Bristol 170 Wayfarer (G-AGVB) was loaned to Channel Islands Airways. In 1947, the British government nationalised the UK airlines, including Jersey Airways, to form British European Airways (BEA). The Channel Islands authorities resisted this move, feeling that it was unacceptable to be dictated to by the British Government, who had no legal jurisdiction over the islands. However it was made plain that flights from the Channel Islands would not otherwise be allowed to land in England, and consequently on 1 April 1947, the airline staff, the eight Dragon Rapides and their routes all became part of BEA. ==Jersey Airways fleet 1933-1940== { - !Type !Registration !Name - DH.84 G-ACMC St. Brelade's Bay - DH.84 G-ACMJ St. Aubin's Bay - DH.84 G-ACMO St. Ouen's Bay - DH.84 G-ACMP St. Clement's Bay - DH.84 G-ACNG Portelet Bay - DH.84 G-ACNH Bouley Bay - DH.84 G-ACNI Bonne Nuit Bay - DH.84 G-ACNJ Rozel Bay -    - DH.86 G-ACYF Giffard Bay - DH.86 G-ACYG Grouville Bay - DH.86 G-ACZN St. Catherine's Bay - DH.86 G-ACZO Ouain√© Bay - DH.86 G-ACZP Belcroute Bay - DH.86 G-ACZR La Saline Bay -    - DH.89 G-ADBV St. Ouen's Bay II - DH.89 G-ADBW (unnamed) } ==Accidents== * 29 June 1936: de Havilland DH.84 Dragon Rozel Bay overshot Alderney Airport.

Donald attended the University of Richmond, earning a B.S. in chemistry in 1956. He continued his education at the Medical College of Virginia. In 1957, he married Joan Phillips and two years later he completed his M.D. He completed his residency at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Millar (in sunglasses) present at the 100 millionth smallpox vaccination (1969) Millar began working for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1961. Beginning in 1963 he directed CDC's Smallpox Eradication Program and its predecessors, an effort he led until 1970. A supporter of mass vaccination, Millar explained that the gravest danger posed by the lack of public acceptance of mass immunization programs was the threat to whites by \\"Spanish-Americans and Negroes\\", which was \\"the greatest motive for supporting mass vaccination campaigns at home and abroad\\". In 1972, while Chief of the CDC Venereal Disease Control Program, he famously said of the Tuskegee long-term study of untreated syphilis in African Americans, \\"They were not denied drugs, rather, they were not offered drugs.\\" In 1966, he was awarded a D.T.P.H. (Lond.)‚Äîa degree equivalent to a Master's of Public Health degree in the United States‚Äîfrom the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ==Early career== Millar began working for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health under then-director John Finklea. Finklea was the Institute's second director. Since taking over the head spot in 1975 from Dr. Marcus M. Key, Finklea had tried to change the Institute's direction, taking a more aggressive approach than Key had. Finklea began to feel pressure to resign from stakeholders inside and outside of the organization. He resigned abruptly in March, 1978, which left Millar as NIOSH's acting director. Millar held the post, sorting out conflicts within the Institute, until Anthony Robbins was appointed director 1979. Following Robbins's appointment, Millar was hired as the director of the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH). He served in that capacity until Robbins resigned in 1981. Millar was appointed in his place as director of NIOSH, a position he held until 1993. ==NIOSH Director== In his more than decade as director of NIOSH, Millar established the Institute as a mature organization. He expanded NIOSH's focus beyond chemical hazards, an area which had consumed the attention of his predecessors. He led studies concerning such varied topics as vibration syndrome (caused by vibrating tools such as pneumatic hammers and gasoline chain saws); electrocution from metal ladders being too near power lines; and occupational fatalities in confined spaces. His approach to occupational safety was typified by his manner of addressing tractor rollovers, which he referred to as an \\"occupational obscenity\\". He advocated the use of a rollover protective structure (ROPS) on every tractor in use, saying, \\"There is no scientific excuse for the persistence of this problem. This is something we know how to prevent\\". In addition to his work at NIOSH, Millar chaired the executive committee of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) from 1989 to 1993. He maintained an adjunct professorship of occupational and environmental health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta (1988‚Äì1998). He served on a panel of occupational health experts for the World Health Organization, and he continued his efforts to eradicate smallpox. In 1987, he was presented with the Gorgas Medal from the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States (AMSUS). For his work, Dr. Millar has been twice honored with the Distinguished Service Medal (1983 and 1989), highest honor bestowed by the United States Public Health Service. He was named Honorary Fellow of the Faculty of Occupational Medicine, Royal College of Physicians, London (U.K.). He received the William S. Knudsen Award from the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine for \\"outstanding contributions to occupational medicine.\\" In 1993, Millar was given the William Steiger Memorial Award from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, the Health Watch Award for \\"outstanding contributions toward improving the health of minority populations\\", and the Surgeon General's Medallion for \\"exceptional skill and fortitude.\\" ==Workplace health consultant== Millar retired from NIOSH and the US Public Health Service with the rank of Rear Admiral in 1993, turning his directorship over to Linda Rosenstock. He started a consulting company in 1993, Don Millar & Associates, Inc., in Murrayville, GA. As president of the company, Millar provided his services in the occupational and environmental health industry. He chaired several scientific panels and workshops, and served as vice chairman of the Public Health Policy Advisory Board (PHPAB), a Washington \\"think-tank\\" fostering science-based public health policy. He also served on editorial and advisory boards of the American Journal of Industrial Medicine, the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, and the Journal of Occupational Health Psychology. ==Personal== Millar was an accomplished musician who was part of the DeKalb Symphony Orchestra, Gainesville, GA; the Truett-Mcconnell College Wind Symphony; and the Toccoa Symphony Orchestra. He enjoyed sailing and was an amateur Civil War historian. He and Joan had three children. He died of kidney failure on August 30, 2015. ==References== Category:1934 births Category:2015 deaths Category:National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Category:University of Richmond alumni Category:Medical College of Virginia alumni Category:University of Utah School of Medicine alumni Category:Alumni of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine Category:American public health doctors Category:Emory University faculty Category:United States Navy rear admirals (upper half) ","title":"J.

Its three buildings on two acres were listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1985. The church itself was established in 1790, the first non-Dutch church in the Catskill region.Greenville itself, located several miles north of the Catskill Escarpment, is not actually in the mountains. Its current building dates to 1860, and is a well-designed late example of the Greek Revival architectural style. The chapel and former school building, now part of the local library, were added in 1885 and 1906 respectively. ==Church complex== There are three buildings considered contributing properties to the NRHP listing. All are located on a strip of land along the west side of Route 32 just north of the Route 81 intersection in the center of Greenville. To the immediate west is property owned by the Town of Greenville, and Greenville High School. ===Church=== The church itself is a one-and-a-half-story structure on a stone foundation sided in clapboard on all sides save the east- facing front, done in flush board. That facade has square pillars and a pediment topped by a three-story tower with a belfry and octagonal gold- colored spire with weathervane. The tower's three sections all feature corner pilasters and overhanging eaves. A small stained glass window looks out from the front of the base section. Behind the pillars is the main entrance, framed by pilasters supporting a full entablature with another stained glass window above. On either side the double doors have a fluted Ionic column in front of a small window. Paneled corner pilasters support the gabled roof and its cornice, with a full entablature. Both north and south profiles are fenestrated with four stained glass windows, with an additional smaller one on the north. The rear has cornice returns and a single double-hung sash window in the gable. A brick chimney rises from the south side of the roof. Inside, the vestibule is flanked by small rooms. In the nave, oak pews become curved toward the chancel. There, the dark oak pulpit is raised and flanked by similar balustrades on either side. Behind it is a large pedimented cornice with similar pilasters and columns to the entrance. The organ is located in the recess. At the rear of the church is a gallery and the stairs to the bell tower. The interior is lit with a chandelier over the pulpit and teardrop lights over the congregation. The ceiling is plaster with canted corners. On the side walls there is wainscoting and a molded entablature, with all the large windows having broad molded surrounds. ===Chapel=== The chapel building, built a quarter-century later, is similar to the church, on a smaller scale. It is a one-story clapboard building on a stone block foundation with a shallow gabled roof and smaller belltower with tent roof. Its facade shows some Italianate influence such as an overhanging cornice with full entablature. The chapel's double-doored entrance is itself topped by a projecting cornice with scroll-sawn brackets and drop pendants. Its rear has a small shed-roofed wing with windows and a door with small projecting gable. The interior of the chapel has been altered, but retains its original wainscoting and window surrounds. ===Greenville Free Academy building=== The school building, newest of the three, is a square two-story building of similar materials with a pyramidal roof pierced by a brick chimney just south of the peak. It comes to exposed rafter ends at the roofline's overhanging eaves. The entrance is a reconstruction of the one on the previous school building, a porch with Doric columns supporting a full balustrade and a double-doored entrance with broad transom. The interior has been extensively renovated but still has its original tin-embossed ceiling on the first floor hall. ===Aesthetics=== The Greek Revival style gained popularity in the 1820s with a nation that saw itself carrying on the classical ideals of freedom and democracy. By the 1850s it had run its course, with few new residential, commercial or public structures using it. But it remained popular for churches until the Civil War, and the Greenville church is a well-developed, sophisticated late application of the style, using the classical forms correctly and with a high degree of decoration. The school building, now used as the town library and administrative offices, is also of some architectural note. While it typifies the rural school designs of the early 20th century, it is an unusually large example. ==History== The Greenville area, known originally as Freehold, was first prepared for settlement by Augustine Prevost, who received a patent from the British Crown in 1767 as a reward for his service during the French and Indian War. He built roads and mills, and continued to own the property through the Revolution. In the 1790s, his efforts paid off as a new wave of pioneers came to New York, the younger sons of New England farmers and their families. Although there were already long- established communities along the Hudson River, the New Englanders avoided them as they were leery of the Dutch-descended inhabitants and their language, religion and customs. They organized their congregation in 1790, receiving a two-acre gift from Prevost that restricted the property's future use to educational and religious purposes. It was the first non-Dutch church in the Catskill region. The original meeting house was built in 1793 on a site just to the northwest of the current church. In 1794 the congregation formally incorporated and called the Rev. Beriah Hotchkiss to be its pastor, and in 1796 it became affiliated with the Northern Association Presbytery. Four years later, at the turn of the century, a newer, larger meeting house was built. It was described as having \\"a lofty spire, a spacious gallery, unpainted box pews, and an octagonal pulpit supported by a lofty column\\". The original meeting house was bought and moved to a nearby site, going through several uses before it was eventually demolished. In 1815 the educational aspect of the land gift was secured with the construction of the first Greenville Free Academy Building, the first free public school in Greene County. Nine years later the church formally became known as the Greenville Presbyterian Church when it joined the Synod of Albany. The meeting hall was expanded and remodeled in 1845. At the beginning of 1859 that work was lost when it burned down. The current church was its replacement, although a marble commemorative plaque was not placed over the door until 1872. A quarter-century later, in 1885, its original mahogany pulpit was replaced along with its white pews. The chapel was built the same year to accommodate smaller functions such as prayer gatherings and meetings of the board of trustees. The stained-glass windows were added to the church between 1904 and 1913. During that time, in 1906, the new school building was built. In 1930, the school became part of the new Greenville Central School District and was extensively renovated by the Presbyterian Society. The chapel was sold to the local American Legion post in 1938 and has since been used by them and a local Boy Scout troop. The school building underwent further renovations to become the Greenville library in 1957. In 1975 the porch was remodeled to resemble the porch on the 1815 building. There have been no significant alterations to the property since. ==Notes and references *Greenville Public Library website * Greene County Properties website Category:Presbyterian churches in New York (state) Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Religious organizations established in 1790 Category:Churches completed in 1860 Category:19th-century Presbyterian church buildings in the United States Category:Presbyterian congregations established in the 18th century Category:Churches in Greene County, New York Category:National Register of Historic Places in Greene County, New York ","title":"Greenville Presbyterian Church (New York)"},{"id":"20184725","text":"Doriprismatica sedna is a species of colorful sea slug, a dorid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Chromodorididae.Bouchet, P.

Format  The format of the competition consisted of four shows: two quarter-finals, one semi-final and a final. All shows were hosted by Ben Roelants. Results during the heats and the semi-final shows were determined by the three-member jury panel and votes from the public. In the quarter-finals the songs first faced a public televote where the top two entries qualified. The jury then selected an additional qualifier from the remaining entries to proceed in the competition. In the semi-finals the songs first faced a public televote where the top three entries qualified. The jury then selected an additional qualifier from the remaining entries to proceed in the competition. In the final, public televoting exclusively determined the winner. The jury participated in each show by providing feedback to the competing artists and selecting entries to advance in the competition. The panel consists of: * Stijn Kolacny * Pascale Platel * Andre Vermeulen  Competing entries  A total of 548 songs were received by VRT for the contest, with only 10 (nine in Dutch and one in French) being chosen to compete in the national final. { class=\\"sortable \\" style=\\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" ! align=\\"left\\" Artist !Song (English translation) -  align=\\"left\\" Chlo√©  align=\\"left\\"  \\"Un nouveau r√™ve\\" (A new dream) -  align=\\"left\\"  Didier & Charlotte  align=\\"left\\"  \\"Samen\\" (Together) -  align=\\"left\\" Elke  align=\\"left\\"  \\"Geniet van elk moment\\" (Enjoy every moment) - Guust \\"Ik hou van muziek\\" (I love music) - Mathilde \\"Vergeet-mij-liedje\\" (Forget-me-song) - MC Louis \\"In de echte wereld\\" (In the real world) - Mystery of Darkness \\"Familierock\\" (Family rock) - style=\\"background-color:gold; font- weight:bold;\\"  align=\\"left\\" Oliver  align=\\"left\\" \\"Shut Up!\\" - The Pinsons \\"Waarom?\\" (Why?) -  align=\\"left\\"  Vince  align=\\"left\\"  \\"Al fluitend door het leven\\" (Whistling through life) - }  Quarter-final 1  The first quarter-final took place on 6 September 2008.

It was last played in 2011. Before its discontinuation, it had a prize fund of 1.2 million rand and was held at the Wild Coast Sun Country Club on the KwaZulu-Natal border, South Africa. The tournament had its roots in the South African Professional Match Play Championship, the running of which was taken over by the PGA of South Africa in 1957. Under the sponsorship of Dunlop the event transitioned into a 72-hole stroke play event in 1960. The first edition of the new Dunlop Masters, at Houghton Golf Club in 1960, was won by Gary Player with an aggregate score of 266, a record that stood for 44 years. Player's total was equalled in 1970 by John Fourie, the only amateur to claim the title. Andrew McLardy posted 264 at the Wild Coast resort in 2004 and Darren Fichardt holds the record of 263 set on the par-70 course in 2009. The South African Masters, along with the South African Open and the South African PGA Championship formed the Triple Crown.

He played all but two of his games for Worcestershire, who capped him in 1959; the others were for Combined Services. ==Career== Pearson's career was at times controversial. He was called for throwing in his second match in 1954, and in the opening match of the 1959 Indian tour, he was no-balled five times by umpire Syd Buller on the first day. He was no-balled again once in a County Championship match three weeks later, and then twice more in a match in 1960. Pearson made his first-class debut for Worcestershire at Worcester against Cambridge University in June 1954, taking four wickets; his first victim was Colin Smith. He played one more first-class match that summer, but none at all in 1955 and just two in each of 1956 and 1957. In that last year, both appearances were for Combined Services: Pearson was in the Royal Air Force, for whose team he had appeared in a minor match against his county in 1956. Pearson's first-class career really began in 1958: that season he played 24 times for Worcestershire and collected 62 wickets at 22.22, twice managing five wickets in an innings. He was capped the following season, and repaid his county with his best season's aggregate: 79 wickets, taken at 25.69 apiece. That year too he achieved his career-best bowling performance, claiming 6‚Äì70 against Leicestershire, picking up three more five-wicket hauls in the course of the season. Pearson began 1960 as a first-team regular, and early in the year produced his best match figures, 11‚Äì145 against Glamorgan; he also took nine wickets in the game against Oxford University. He held his place until mid-season, but some disappointing figures then saw him drop into the Second XI, whence he did not re-emerge until August. He then played three County Championship games for a total return of just two wickets, and was out of the side again by the end of the season, ending with only 45 wickets for the summer. Except for an early (and wicketless) outing against the Australians, Pearson was confined to the Second XI for the first half of 1961. However, he took plenty of wickets for the seconds, and was restored to the first team in mid-August, playing Worcestershire's last five matches of the season. Sadly for him, his promotion was not successful: despite four wickets in his first game back, against Nottinghamshire, he took only four more wickets in total. His career came to a quiet end against Sussex at Hove in early September, a game in which Pearson bowled just four overs. After he retired from cricket he worked in the probation service, where \\"he became a national expert in divorce court liaison work\\".Stephen Chalke, The Way It Was, Fairfield, Bath, 2011, p. 183. ==ReferencesCategory:English cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Combined Services cricketers Category:1937 births Category:Living people ","title":"Derek Pearson"},{"id":"20184779","text":"Harlan Edward Young (September 28, 1883 ‚Äì March 26, 1975) nicknamed \\"Cy the Third\\", was a professional baseball pitcher.

The origins of the family are in Lower Saxony. During the Baltic crusades they settled in Livonia in the first half of the 12th century. Bishops Albert of Riga and Herman of Tartu had a sister whose husband Engelbertus de Tisenhuse was the progenitor of the family in the Baltic. After some time in southern Livonia in the early stages of occupation, Engelbertus joined his brother-in-law bishop Herman to obtain the northern Livonian country of Ugaunia around Otep√§√§ and Tartu. It was Ugaunia where the family held its main early properties and positions. Engelbertus' son married a daughter of the castellan of Koknese in Latgale and through this marriage, the family claims descent from indigenous princes of the Latgalians. Some branches of Tisenhusen clan settled later to the Latvian Vidzeme holdings of Ergli and Berzaune. From the ancestral place of Ugaunia, sons of the family managed to obtain estates in other parts of Estonia, also so-called Danish Estonia and Osilia-Rotalia, both by services and by marriages.

He was born in Karakalpakstan, in a remote village near modern-day Muynak. His father was a poor fisherman and his mother, who gave him the nickname Berdakh, died when he was 10 years old. His father also died while Berdakh was still a child, and so Berdakh became an orphan. Berdakh studied in a maktab and at the same time he grazed his fellow villagers' cattle. His brother helped him to go to Karakum madrasah, a Muslim religious school, but Berdakh dropped out from the school because of his freethinking poetry. The young poet began to study folk poetry and narrative classical masterpieces of the East. His tutor, Kunkhoja, (1799‚Äì1880) who was famous for his folk poetry, helped him with his poetry. Ajinyaz, (1824‚Äì1878) another famous poet of that time, also played a significant role in Berdakh's life. For a long time Berdakh had to earn money playing the dutar at weddings. He sang his songs at weddings and different festive occasions. His songs were about the fate of a deprived man whose life was very hard. His most famous poem, Tsar Samodur, shows his life and poetic experience. His other poems included For the people, Amangeldi, Aydos biy, and Ernazar biy. During Berdakh's lifetime there was a rise in national liberation movements among the nations of the Aral Sea territory, especially among the Karakalpaks. Karakalpakia became a hotspot of discord among those nations. The khanate of Khiva considered Karakalpakia to be a nabob and was constantly imposed duties on its people. The Russian Empire was also interested in Karakalpakia as it was a gateway to Central Asia. Berdakh wrote not only about social problems but also about the protection of women's rights and dignity. He propagated equality and women's rights. His dream was to unite nations which were separated by different wars.

UPCRC Illinois is a joint research effort of the Department of Computer Science and the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Research is conducted by faculty members and graduate students from the departments of Computer Science and Electrical and Computer Engineering. UPCRC Illinois research faculty are led by Co-Directors Marc Snir and Wen-mei Hwu. ==Research== The UPCRC Illinois whitepaper, Parallel Computing Research at Illinois: The UPCRC Agenda, expands in great detail about three primary research themes: *Focus on Disciplined Parallel Programming‚ÄîSequential languages have evolved to support well- structured programming, and provide safety and modularity. Mechanisms for parallel control, synchronization, and communication have not yet undergone a similar evolution. The UPCRC Illinois takes the optimistic view that parallelism can be tamed for all to use by providing disciplined parallel programming models, supported by sophisticated development and execution environments. *Multi-Front Attack on Multicore Programming‚ÄîUPCRC Illinois is taking an integrated broad-based attack on parallelism at all levels of the system stack from applications down to hardware, using every weapon in the arsenal to enable performance, scalability, and programmability. This includes investigating disciplined parallel languages, metaprogramming and autotuners, and domain-specific environments; developing a powerful translation environment to exploit information from multiple sources at different times in the life of a program; developing an adaptive runtime to handle heterogeneity and automate resource management; developing new hardware mechanisms to enhance performance, scalability and programmability; and rethinking the customary division of labor among the layers of the system stack. Refactoring tools will help move existing code to new environments and formal methods- based techniques and tools will help ensure correctness. *Human-Centric Vision of Future Consumer Applications‚ÄîDriving the agenda is a human-centric vision of future consumer applications, backed up by research on application technologies to enable quantum-leaps in immersive visual realism, reliable natural-language processing, and robust telepresence. Investigating these applications reveals new parallel patterns and serves as a testbed for evaluating, refining, and ultimately proving UPCRC Illinois ideas on multicore programming. ==Parallel Computing History at Illinois== Illinois history in parallel computing stretches more than 40 years. From the first academic parallel supercomputer, the ILLIAC IV started in 1964, to today's work to install the first petascale computer, Blue Waters, Illinois has defined the landscape of parallel computing.

Max soon falls for Tina, while she was still in love with Cord. While Max and Tina are marrying in ceremony, she accidentally says Cord's name during her vows, and Max then calls off his relationship with her. Max's brother Steve Holden (Russ Anderson) comes to town in 1987 and soon becomes involved with and marries Gabrielle Medina (Fiona Hutchison), Max's ex-girlfriend and mother to his son, Al. Gabrielle still cares for Max, however, and the relationship with Steve falls apart in 1988.

In 2002, in a drunken Las Vegas escapade he awakes to find himself married to Roxy Balsom (Ilene Kristen), a union that quickly fizzles. When son Al dies of liver failure in the fall of 2003, at the advice of Luna's spirit, Max leaves Llanview to be with his and Luna's twins Frank and Leslie in North Carolina. Max returns in August 2007 for the funeral of Asa, and reveals that he, Frank, and Leslie were all living in Gabrielle's home country of Argentina. He invites Blair to join him there and kisses her, unaware of her continuing passion for Todd Manning. Blair gently rebuffs him.

The film is based on the life of famed clarinetist Benny Goodman, who recorded most of the clarinet solos used in the film. The film captures several major moments in Goodman's life but it has been described as less than accurate in details. Goodman's Jewish background is mentioned only implicitly, despite its playing a part in his artistic and personal endeavors for decades. In one scene, where his mother tries to talk him out of a romance with Alice Hammond (played by Donna Reed), whom Goodman eventually married, she says, \\"Bagels and caviar don't mix.\\" ==Plot== The young Benny Goodman is taught clarinet by a Chicago music professor. He is advised by bandleader Kid Ory to play whichever kind of music he likes best, but to make a living, Benny begins by joining the Ben Pollack traveling band. Later in New York, where his new band gets a lukewarm reception, Benny meets jazz lover John Hammond and his sister Alice. He is invited to the stately Hammond home to perform Mozart's Clarinet Concerto. Alice fears he will be embarrassed, but his playing is impeccable and Benny appreciates her concern. Benny's performances on a popular Saturday night radio program result in Fletcher Henderson volunteering to do some arrangements for him. On the west coast, the radio show's early start has made Benny's music a sensation with a younger generation. He puts together a quartet featuring Gene Krupa on drums, Teddy Wilson on piano and Lionel Hampton on vibraphone. The romance with society girl Alice is disconcerting to Benny's mother, but by the time her son plays Carnegie Hall, all is well and Mrs. Goodman has personally invited her future daughter-in-law to sit by her side. ==Cast== *Steve Allen as Benny Goodman *Donna Reed as Alice Hammond *Berta Gersten as Dora Goodman *Herbert Anderson as John Hammond *Robert F.

However, while Ziggy Elman appeared on screen recreating his trumpet solo on \\"And the Angels Sing\\", he was unable to record his portion for the soundtrack; Mannie Klein actually performed it, off-camera. Similarly, Red Mack's performance in the film is actually played by Alvin Alcorn. Fletcher Henderson is portrayed by Sammy Davis, Sr., father of Sammy Davis, Jr. Famed talent scout John Hammond was dissatisfied with the way he and the rest of the Hammond family, including sister Alice, were portrayed in the movie. He objected and the next version of the script saw his character completely removed, with all of his actions given over to another character, Willard Alexander, Goodman's manager. Hammond objected even more strenuously, pointing out Willard Alexander did not, among many other things, host the party in the Hammond mansion where Goodman played Mozart publicly for the first time, nor did he introduce Alice to Benny. In the end, Hammond reluctantly agreed to leave his portrayal in the film, though he sued for $50,000 for being portrayed in what he thought was an unflattering manner. ==References* * Category:1956 films Category:1950s biographical drama films Category:1950s musical drama films Category:American films Category:American biographical drama films Category:American musical drama films Category:Biographical films about musicians Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Henry Mancini Category:Jazz films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Benny Goodman Category:Cultural depictions of jazz musicians Category:Cultural depictions of American men Category:1956 directorial debut films Category:1956 drama films ","title":"The Benny Goodman Story"},{"id":"20185214","text":"Guinness World Records Smashed is a British television show for Sky1, that features record attempts, celebrity guests and death-defying stunts.

(The first official in the line of succession is generally established in the state or territorial constitution). == Lieutenant governors == In 43 states and four territories, this official is a statewide elected lieutenant governor (In 2010 New Jersey elected its first lieutenant governor). In three states and one territory, this official is the state secretary of state. In four states, the president of the state senate (the upper house of the state legislature) is first in line of succession; two of these officials (Tennessee and West Virginia) may statutorily use the title lieutenant governor. Of the elected lieutenant governors (including New Jersey), 25 are elected on a ticket in the general election with the gubernatorial candidate as a running mate. Most states allow the governor to designate his or her running mate, but in some states, the governor and lieutenant governor run separately in the primary election and are \\"paired\\" for the general election. In 18 other states, the lieutenant governor and the governor are elected separately and as a result may be of different political parties. Lieutenant governors typically are acting governor when the governor is out of state. Thirty lieutenant governor are presidents of the state Senate, and of these half may cast tie-breaking votes (mirroring the Federal government of the United States, in which the Vice President of the United States is the president of the United States Senate). ==History== The NLGA was founded in 1962, as the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors (NCLG). The organization's first meeting was on December 4, 1962. In 1966, NCLG affiliated with the Council of State Governments (CSG) and was staffed through CSG from 1983 to 1988 with Edward Feigenbaum as director. In 1988, NCLG became financially independent. Gail Manning ran the organization's operations and was named director in 1991; she served until 2002. In 2002, Julia Hurst became executive director. The same year, the organization adopted its current name and a new logo and launched its website. The Association was incorporated in Kentucky in January 2013 and assumed independent corporate status and operations July 1, 2013. ==Functions== NLGA provides members the opportunity to network, meet, foster interstate cooperation, gain policy knowledge, hone professional skills, share policy work, and promote the effectiveness of the office of lieutenant governor. NLGA does adopt national policy resolutions on subjects of importance to the membership. NLGA Articles provide for the Chairmanship to rotate annually between a Democrat and Republican. The Chair Elect is of the opposite party to the chair and assumes the role of Chair the following year. The association office is located in Covington, Kentucky. The full membership meets twice a year, annually in Washington, DC for its Federal-State Relations meeting and annually in the summer in a select host state. In 2007, NLGA was given the prestigious 'Associations Advance America' recognition by the American Society of Association Executives (ASAE). NLGA was determined to have one of the six best association programs in the nation for 'Ending Cervical Cancer in our Lifetime,' a nationwide health care campaign. NLGA has also been recognized for work by Women in Government, the American Cardiology Association, and the American Iron and Steel Institute.http://www.womeningovernment.org/files/file/main- news/WIGPresidentialLeadershipAwards2007Announcement.pdf ==List of Chairs of the NGLA== {  + Chairs of the National Lieutenant Governors Associationhttp://www.nlga.us/wp-content/uploads/4.2017-COMPILED-NLGA-All- Chairs.doc !

A 28,000-strong force led by Peshwa Baji Rao II whilst on their way to attack the company-held Pune, were unexpectedly met by an 800-strong Company force that was on its way to reinforce the British troops in Pune. The Peshwa dispatched around 2,000 soldiers to attack the force which sought entrenchment in Koregaon. Led by Captain Francis Staunton, the Company troops defended their position for nearly 12 hours, before the Peshwa's troops ultimately withdrew, fearing the imminent arrival of a larger British force. The battle was part of the Third Anglo Maratha war, a series of battles that culminated in the defeat of the Maratha empire and subsequent rule of the British East India Company in nearly all of Western, Central and Southern India. There is a \\"victory pillar\\" (obelisk) in Koregaon commemorating the battle. == Background == By the 1800s, the Marathas were organized into a loose confederacy, with the major constituents being the Peshwa of Pune, the Scindia of Gwalior, the Holkar of Indore, the Gaekwad of Baroda, and the Bhosale of Nagpur. The British had subjugated and signed peace treaties with these factions, establishing Residencies at their capitals. The British intervened in a revenue-sharing dispute between the Peshwa and Gaekwad, and on 13 June 1817, the Company forced Peshwa Baji Rao II to sign an agreement renouncing claims on Gaekwad's revenues and ceding large swaths of territory to the British. This treaty of Pune formally ended the Peshwa's titular overlordship over other Maratha chiefs, thus officially ending the Maratha confederacy. Soon after this, the Peshwa burnt down the British Residency at Pune, but was defeated in the Battle of Khadki near Pune on 5 November 1817. The Peshwa then fled to Satara, and the Company forces took complete control of Pune. Pune was placed under Colonel Charles Barton Burr, while a British force led by General Smith pursued Peshwa. Smith feared that Peshwa could escape to Konkan and overpower the small British detachment there. Therefore, he instructed Colonel Burr to send reinforcements to Konkan, and in turn, call in for reinforcements from Shirur, if needed. Meanwhile, the Peshwa managed to escape beyond Smith's pursuit, but his southward advance was constrained by the advance of a Company force led by General Theophilus Pritzler. He then changed his route, marching eastwards before turning north-west towards Nashik. Realizing that General Smith was in a position to intercept him, he suddenly turned southwards towards Pune. Towards the end of December, Colonel Burr received news that the Peshwa intended to attack Pune, and asked the Company troops stationed at Shirur for help. The troops dispatched from Shirur came across the Peshwa's forces, resulting in the Battle of Koregaon. === Peshwa's forces === The Peshwa's army comprised 20,000 cavalry and 8,000 infantry. Out of these, around 2,000 men were deployed in the action, constantly reinforced during the battle. The force that attacked the Company troops consisted of three infantry parties of 600 soldiers each. These soldiers included Arabs, Gosains and Marathas (the caste). The majority of the attackers were Arabs (mercenaries and their descendants), reputed to be the finest among the Peshwa's soldiers. The attackers were supported by a cavalry and two pieces of artillery. The attack was directed by Bapu Gokhale, Appa Desai and Trimbakji Dengle. Trimbakji was the only among these to enter the Koregaon village, once during the attack. The Peshwa and other chiefs stayed at Phoolsheher (modern Phulgaon) near Koregaon. The titular Maratha Chatrapati, Pratap Singh of Satara, also accompanied the Peshwa. === Company forces === The Company troops dispatched from Shirur comprised 834 men, including: * Around 500 soldiers of the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry, led by Captain Francis Staunton. Other officers included: ** Lieutenant and Adjuntant Pattison ** Lieutenant Jones ** Assistant-Surgeon Wingate * Around 300 auxiliary horsemen under Lieutenant Swanston * 24 European and 4 Native Madras artillerymen with two 6-pounder guns, led by Lieutenant Chisholm. Besides Chisholm, Assistant-Surgeon Wyllie (or Wyldie) was the only officer in the artillery. The Company troops of Indian origin included Mahars, Marathas, Rajputs, Muslims, and Jews. This was mostly the troops that Capt. Staunton had raised three months ago with the object of strengthening the defense of Poona that was already under British control. ==The battle== British defence plan during Battle of Koregaon The Company troops left Shirur at 8 pm on 31 December 1817. After marching all night and covering a distance of 25 miles, they reached the high ground behind Talegaon Dhamdhere. From there, they spotted Peshwa's army across the Bhima River. Captain Staunton marched up to Koregaon Bhima village, which was located on the banks of the river. The village was surrounded by a low mud wall. Captain Staunton made a feint of crossing the shallow Bhima river. A 5,000-strong infantry, which was slightly ahead of the Peshwa's base, retreated to inform him about the presence of British forces. Meanwhile, Staunton stationed his forces in Koregaon instead of crossing the river. He secured a strong position for his guns, posting one of them to guard an approach from the Bhima river (which was running almost dry), and another to guard the road from Shirur. After the return of his 5,000-strong infantry, the Peshwa dispatched three infantry parties of Arab, Gosain and Maratha soldiers. Each party comprised 300‚Äì600 soldiers. The parties crossed the Bhima River at three different points, supported by two cannons and rocket fire. Peshwa's troops also made a feint attack from the Shirur road. By noon, the Arabs took control of a temple on the outskirts of the village. One of the temples was retaken by a party led by Lieutenant and Assistant Surgeon Wyllie. The Arabs also captured the sole gun guarding the river, and killed eleven gunners, including their officer Lieutenant Chisholm. Driven by thirst and hunger, some of the Company's gunners suggested negotiating a surrender. However, Captain Staunton refused to yield. A group led by Lieutenant Pattison retook the gun, and found Lieutenant Chisholm's body with the head cut off. Captain Staunton declared that this would be the fate of those who fall into the enemy hands. This encouraged the gunners to fight on. The Company troops successfully defended the village. Peshwa's forces ceased firing and left the village by 9 pm, driven by the fear of approaching British reinforcements under General Joseph Smith. At night, the Company troops managed to procure a supply of water. The Peshwa remained near Koregaon on the next day but did not launch another attack. Captain Staunton, who was not aware of General Smith's advance, believed that the Peshwa would attack the Company troops on the Koregaon-Pune route. On the night of 2 January, Staunton first pretended to go in the direction of Pune but then marched back to Shirur, carrying most of his wounded soldiers. According to the Interesting Intelligence from the London Gazette: \\"Accounts have been received from Lt Col Burr, dated the 3rd (January, 1818), intimating that Capt. Staunton, commanding the 2nd battalion 1st regiment of Bombay Native Infantry, had been fortunately able to commence his march back to Seroor, with 125 wounded, having buried 50 at Goregaum (sic), and left 12 or 15 there, badly wounded; that the Peshwa had proceeded Southward, General Smith in pursuit, which had probably saved the battalion.\\" \\"Interesting Intelligence from the London Gazette\\" (June 1818) page 550 == Casualties == Out of the 834 Company troops, 275 were killed, wounded or missing. The dead included two officers ‚Äî Assistant-Surgeon Wingate and Lieutenant Chisholm; Lieutenant Pattison later died of his wounds in Shirur. Among the infantrymen, 50 were killed and 105 wounded. Among the artillery, 12 were killed and 8 were wounded. The dead Company soldiers of Indian origin included 22 Mahars, 16 Marathas, 8 Rajputs, 2 Muslims, and 1-2 Jews. According to the British estimates, around 500 to 600 of Peshwa's soldiers were killed or wounded in the battle. Mountstuart Elphinstone, who visited Koregaon two days later on 3 January 1818, wrote that the houses had been burned and the streets were filled with dead bodies of horses and men. There were around 50 dead bodies lying in the village, most of them of the Peshwa's Arab soldiers. There were six dead bodies outside the village. In addition, there were shallow graves of 50 native sepoys, 11 European soldiers and the 2 deceased officers belonging to the Company forces. == Aftermath == When Elphinstone visited the battle field shortly after its completion, he found that the Company soldiers had completely lost their morale and were reluctant to believe the praises that were showered on them . General Smith arrived in Koregaon on 3 January, but by this time, the Peshwa had already left the area. A company force led by General Pritzler pursued Peshwa, who tried to escape to Mysore. Meanwhile, General Smith captured Satara, the capital of Pratap Singh. Smith intercepted Peshwa in a battle on 19 February 1818 at Ashtoon (or Ashta); Bapuji Gokhale was killed in this action. The Peshwa then fled to Khandesh, while his jagirdars accepted the Company's suzerainty. A dejected Peshwa then met with John Malcolm on 2 June 1818, and surrendered his royal claims in exchange for a pension and a residence in Bithoor. Trimbakji Dengle was captured near Nashik and imprisoned at the Chunar Fort. As a reward for their bravery in the Battle of Koregaon, the 2nd battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Bombay Native Infantry was made Grenadiers. Their regiment came to be known as 1st Grenadier Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry. The official report to the British Residents at Poona recalls the \\"heroic valour and enduring fortitude\\" of the soldiers, the \\"disciplined intrepidity\\" and \\"devoted courage and admirable consistency\\" of their actions. Captain Staunton was appointed an honorary aide-de-camp to the Governor General of India. The Court of Directors presented him with a sword and a sum of 500 guineas (gold coins). Later in 1823, he became a Major, and was appointed a companion of the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath. General Thomas Hislop called the battle \\"one of the most heroic and brilliant achievements ever recorded on the annals of the army\\". According to M.S. Naravane, \\"this gallant defense by a small number of Company's troops against an overwhelming Maratha force is rightly considered as one of the most glorious example of valour and fortitude in the annals of the Company's forces.\\" General Smith, in his official report of this battle, wrote, ‚ÄúThe action at Koregaum was one of the most brilliant affairs achieved by any army in which European and Native soldiers displayed the most noble devotion and most romantic bravery under pressure of hunger and thirst almost beyond human endurance. http://www.bharat- rakshak.com/ARMY/images/Poona%20Horse.pdf == Decisiveness == Neither side achieved a decisive victory in the battle. Shortly after the battle, Mountstuart Elphinstone described it as a \\"small victory\\" for the Peshwa. Nevertheless, the East India Company government praised the bravery of its troops, who could not be overpowered despite being outnumbered. Notwithstanding this, the battle being one of the last ones to be fought in the Third Anglo-Maratha War, has since come to be remembered as a Company victory after the war ended with Peshwa's defeat. == Legacy == The battle resulted in losses to the Maratha empire, then under Peshwa rule, and control over most of western, central and southern India by the British East India Company. After India's freedom, in the mid-2010s, this otherwise forgotten battle suddenly came into news when groups of Mahars converged to celebrate the war as the victory of the side on which their mahar forefathers had fought. After centuries of generally desultory treatment, this battle was the first time that Mahars had been included in a battle in which they won. === Memorial === To commemorate its fallen soldiers, the East India Company commissioned a \\"victory pillar\\" (an obelisk) in Koregaon. The inscription of the pillar declares that Captain Staunton's force \\"accomplished one of the proudest triumphs of the British Army in the East.\\" === Significance to Mahars === B. R. Ambedkar and his followers at the Koregaon victory pillar on December 28th 1927 The Koregaon pillar inscription features the names of the 49 Company soldiers killed in the battle. 22 of these names end with the suffix -nac (or -nak), which was used exclusively by the people of Mahar caste. The obelisk was featured on the Mahar Regiment's crest until Indian Independence. While it was built by the British as a symbol of their own power, today it serves as a memorial of the Mahars. The Mahars were considered as untouchable in the contemporary caste-based society. The Peshwas, who were the so-called 'high-caste' Brahmins, were notorious for their mistreatment and persecution of the untouchables. Because of this, the Dalits (former untouchables), after independence, saw the Koregaon obelisk as a symbol of their victory over the high-caste oppression. Dalit Leader B. R. Ambedkar visited the site on 1 January 1927. To commemorate his visit to the site, now thousands of his followers visit the site every New Year's Day. A number of Mahar gatherings have also been held at the place. On 1 January 2018, clashes erupted between right-wing Hindu groups and Dalit Buddhist groups during the commemoration of this battle.Pune's Dalit protests reach Mumbai, suburbs affected This led to further violent protests and rioting in Mumbai and Maharashtra for two days.Protests spread in Maharashtra post clashes during bicentenary celebrations of Bhima-Koregaon battle However a different perspective is presented by the Dalit scholar Anand Teltumbde. He has argued that portraying the Battle of Bhima Koregaon as the battle of Mahars against their caste oppression in Peshwa rule, is a \\"pure myth\\". The Myth of Bhima Koregaon Reinforces the Identities It Seeks to Transcend, Anand Teltumbde, The Wire, 02/JAN/2018 He mentions that most of those died in the battle (27 out of 49) were not Mahar, and the Peshwa army actually retreated fearing the arrival of a larger British force. Thus he considers painting of the battle as Mahars‚Äô against the Peshwas‚Äô Brahmanic rule as misleading. ===Documentary film=== The Battle of Bhima Koregaon: An Unending Journey is a 2017 documentary by Indian filmmaker Somnath Waghamare. It explored the role of 500 Mahar soldiers in Battle of Koregaon on 1 January 1818 against the Peshwa dynasty. ==See also== *Battle of Saragarhi *Mahar Regiment == References  Bibliography === * Koregaon Koregaon Koregaon Koregaon Category:History of Pune Category:1818 in India Category:Dalit history Category:January 1818 events ","title":"Battle of Koregaon"},{"id":"20185395","text":"Kentucky (1861-1875), was a successful American Thoroughbred racehorse who won 21 of his 23 starts, including 20 consecutive wins. ==Background== Kentucky was sired by Lexington, who sired three colts in 1861 (out of Glencoe mares) and each of whom become one of the best race horses in America ‚Äì Norfolk, Asteroid and Kentucky.

The western section is also a 1 1/2 story structure with a full basement and measures about 16 feet wide and 30 feet deep. ==History== Traveler's Rest, 1936 HABS Photo Horatio Gates, a native of England, served in the British Army during the French and Indian War, but was prevented from advancement after the war by a lack of money or political connection. Gates and his family sailed from England to Virginia in 1772 and bought on the Potomac River near Shepherdstown in what is now West Virginia. He built this limestone house and became a slave owner, a local justice, and a lieutenant colonel in the militia. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Gates helped organized the Continental Army, and went on to become of its more controversial generals, gaining the important victory at Saratoga in 1777 and a humiliating loss at Camden in 1780. After the war, Gates returned to Traveller's Rest. In 1790, he sold the home, freed his slaves and moved to New York City. Gates employed John Ariss for interior woodwork, at a time when Ariss was working on nearby projects for the Washington family. Gates added to the original four- bay structure ashlar masonry, appending a three-bay random rubble stone extension. The dormers were added after Gates' tenure. The only major documented alteration to the house after the period of Gates ownership is the addition of dormers to the gabled roof. ==See also== *List of National Historic Landmarks in West Virginia *National Register of Historic Places listings in Jefferson County, West Virginia ==ReferencesCategory:National Historic Landmarks in West Virginia Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in West Virginia Category:Houses in Jefferson County, West Virginia Category:Georgian architecture in West Virginia Category:National Register of Historic Places in Jefferson County, West Virginia Category:Houses completed in 1773 Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in West Virginia Category:Colonial architecture in West Virginia Category:John Ariss buildings Category:Plantation houses in West Virginia Category:1773 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Traveller's Rest (Kearneysville, West Virginia)"},{"id":"20185453","text":"Notable alumni of St. John's University in New York City include, alphabetically: * Peter Abbate, member of New York State Assembly * Joseph P.

It is near downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota, and is considered one of Minnesota's finest public buildings. The History Center is on Kellogg Boulevard, between the Mississippi River and the Minnesota State Capitol.\\"Minnesota History Center\\", p.2. Before this building was built in 1992, the Minnesota Historical Society (MNHS) occupied what is now the Minnesota Judicial Center, originally built for the Society in 1917. Before that, MNHS was housed in the basement of the State Capitol.http://www.minnesotahistorycenter.org/about/about-the-history-center. The Center hosts concerts, dance performances, lectures, conferences, meetings, dinners, political campaign events, memorial services, receptions, parties, and weddings; as many as 75,000 schoolchildren visit the History Center every year. == Architecture == The Minneapolis architectural firm of Hammel Green and Abrahamson (HGA) designed the History Center's floor plan and exterior. HGA looked to Fort Snelling, the St. Paul's Cathedral and the Minnesota State Capitol for inspiration. One member of the History Center Planning Committee said, \\"We have envisioned a place that draws the public in, fires the imagination, and responds to its hunger for an understanding of the past. We have envisioned a building alive with people from morning until far into the evening...a vital cultural and educational center.\\" After ten years of planning and nearly three years of construction, The History Center opened in October 1992. The building features a central dome with two bordering wings, creating an L-shaped design. The north facade faces the Capitol, and the southeast facade overlooks a large lawn and terrace area. Bronze doors admit visitors into the Center's main entrance, on the west wall. The construction budget for the History Center included funds from a Percent for Art program that included three integrated artworks: Charm Bracelet lies on the floor of the first-story rotunda. This project, sculpted by James Casebere, depicts a broken piece of jewelry in which each of ten \\"charms\\" represents an important aspect of Minnesota: a tractor (agriculture); a printer's ink roller (civic society and free speech); a tepee (the Dakota tribe); a mill building (lumbering and flour-milling); a house (family); a power plant (technology and industry); a turtle, bear and fish (nature, outdoor recreation, and Ojibwe totems of healing, defense and learning); and a whooping crane (lost wilderness and a metaphor for history). The entrance of the History Center includes glass etchings by Brit Bunkley above the John Ireland and Kellogg Boulevard entrances and the courtyard doors. He created a \\"system of icons\\" of sandblasted panels with multidimensional iconic imagery deeply etched onto the thick glass surfaces. Andrew Leicester created Minnesota Profiles, terra cotta columns \\"marking the edge of where Summit Avenue once crossed what is today‚Äôs History Center courtyard\\". Each column represents a native tree that also include sculpted profiles of 140 volunteers. The Minnesota History Center is one of the 26 Minnesota Historical Society sites and is home to the Minnesota Historical Society headquarters, the Society's collections, an expansive library, and of museum gallery space. The museum showcases interactive in-house-developed and traveling exhibits, as well as historical programming and lectures.

The term was presented in a theory developed by Edward Azar. Protracted social conflict as Edward Azar termed it, denotes hostile interactions between communal groups that are based in deep-seated racial, ethnic, religious and cultural hatreds, and that persist over long periods of time with sporadic outbreaks of violence; when a group's identity is threatened or frustrated, intractable conflict is almost inevitable.Fisher 2001: 307.

Fisher 2001: 308. ==Definition of protracted social conflict== Protracted social conflicts is a theory developed by Edward Azar. The term refers to conflict situations characterized by the prolonged and often violent struggle by communal groups for such basic needs as security, recognition, acceptance, fair access to political institutions, and economic participation.Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 84. The communal groups may experience deep-seated cleavages based upon racial, religious, cultural or ethnic lines. These cleavages are characterized by continuing hostility with sporadic outbreaks of violence; and caused by the frustration of human needs for security, recognition, and distributive justice. Such identity-driven rifts are the result of an underlying fear of extinction that often grows within vulnerable ethnic groups who live with the memories or fear of persecution and massacre.Haddad 2002: 317 Ethnic divisions and perceived threats often result in the domination of the state machinery by a single group or coalition of elites who deny access to basic human needs for the majority of the population.Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 86‚Äì87. ==Preconditions to violent conflict== Azar argued that the denial of basic human needs to a large portion of the population initiated instances of protracted social violence. Four preconditions are isolated by Azar as the predominant sources of protracted social conflict: communal content, deprivation of human needs, governance and the State's role, and international linkages.Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 85‚Äì87. ===Communal content=== This element, which contributes to the initial creation of protracted social conflict, consists of the fact that people involved in protracted social conflicts create their own identity groups. Azar notes, \\"that it is the relationship between identity groups and the states, which is at the core of the problem.\\" He also cited the \\"disarticulation between the state and society as a whole\\" as a source of violence within a society.Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 85. This precondition also involves the reliance that many people have on their social groups; because governments in areas that experience protracted social conflict are often unable, incapable or unwilling to provide basic human necessities to the population, individuals turn to their social groups for stability. The resultant disconnection of society and the state can be linked to the colonial legacy, which, \\"artificially imposed European ideas of territorial statehood onto a multitude of communal groups.\\"Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 86. This results in the domination of certain identity groups over others. The dominant group isolates itself from the needs of other groups, leading to an even bigger separation between groups even within an ethnicity. To overcome this division of society, national identity must be stressed over individual group identity. ===Deprivation of human needs=== To alleviate the \\"underdevelopments\\" Azar holds responsible for protracted social violence, and in turn overcome the conflict resulting from underdevelopment, Azar points to the needs of security, development, political access and identity in terms of cultural and religious expression. Azar refers to these needs as non-negotiable; therefore, if these needs are not met, people will inevitably want a structural change to take place. Such a need for structural change is likely to result in a violent conflict. This in turn emphasizes Azar's theory that the \\"deprivation of human needs is the underlying source of protracted social conflict\\" where conflict is emphasized by the collective grievances of a group of people. To overcome this deprivation of human needs to entire groups of people, the government must offer security on a multiplicity of levels to all of the constituent population. ===Governance and the State's role=== With government being \\"endowed with the authority to govern and use force where necessary to regulate society, to protect citizens, and to provide collective goods,\\" the government plays a leading role in the satisfaction or lack of satisfaction of minority and identity groups. Azar states that protracted social conflicts can be characterized by \\"incompetent, parochial, fragile, and authoritarian governments that fail to satisfy basic human needs.\\"Ramsbotham, Oliver. Contemporary Conflict Resolution, 2008: 87. It is said that governments, expected to be unbiased and impartial, tend to be dominated by the leading identity groups or those groups that have been able to monopolize power within a country or territorial entity. This creates a \\"crisis of legitimacy\\" in the governance of these countries. The structure of the government needs to be changed so that all citizens are equally cared for and equally represented without bias or corruption. ===International linkages=== This involves the \\"political-economic relations of economic dependency within the international economic system, and the network of political-military linkages constituting regional and global patterns of clientage and cross-border interest.\\" Weaker states, like those often involved in protracted social conflict, tend to be more influenced by outside connections both economically and politically. For example, many states are dependent on an external supply of armament. To overcome the dominance of the international economy, the country in question must work to build institutions that can ease global dependency and stimulate domestic economic growth. ==Resolving protracted social conflict== As Edward Azar stated: Conflict resolution approaches that focus on resources, or the interests of parties, may be appropriate means of conflict resolution in conflicts where the only issues are those of resource and interests; however, in protracted social conflicts the main issue is identity-based. Therefore, to be effective, a conflict resolution framework must specifically emphasize the needs and identities of the conflicting parties. ==ARIA model== Rothman developed a unique approach of conflict resolution that is specifically designed to mitigate protracted social conflict. He terms this approach the ARIA model. In contrast to the model of interactive conflict resolution (ICR) that Fisher proposed in 1996, which includes identity as one of many human needs, the ARIA model \\"keeps its focus more narrowly attuned to identity issues in particular.\\"Rothman, Jay, RESOLVING IDENTITY BASED CONFLICT IN NATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITIES (Jossey Bass, 1997)Rothman, Jay and Marie L. Olson, \\"From Interest to Identities: Towards a New Emphasis in Interactive Conflict Resolution.\\" Journal of Peace Research, 2001; 38: p. 289. Rothman and Olson suggest that conflict can only be truly resolved when identity issues have been sufficiently addressed. The ARIA model is a comprehensive, yet specific approach to resolving protracted social conflict. It attempts to break down \\"the barrier of identity through a four-phased process.\\" The various stages of the ARIA model are outlined below: ===Antagonism (adversarial framing)=== This first step focuses on the tangible \\"what of the conflict.\\" It is defined in \\"us\\" versus \\"them\\" terms and calls on the various entities to elaborate and make clear their underlying values and needs. By bringing animosities to the forefront, it is hoped that the mutual benefits of ending the conflict can be realized. ===Resonance (reflexive‚Äìreframing)=== After parties have articulated their animosities, the next stage is termed the reflexive‚Äìreframing stage where the \\"why\\" and \\"who\\" of the issue is examined. The identity needs of all sides are brought to the forefront with the goal of getting \\"the disputants to move from positional bargaining to interest-based approaches.\\" Rothman and Olson suggest that the parties should now engage in a \\"deep dialogue\\" to give a voice and structure to the underlying needs of the various parties. The needs of the various parties are, in turn, the underlying causes of the conflict. The effect of this stage is termed resonance, as each side has articulated their core concerns and heard the concerns of the other actors. At this point, actors begin to see where their identities converge, and where they diverge. ===Invention=== The third stage is termed \\"inventing\\" and focuses on the \\"how\\" of \\"cooperatively resolving the conflict and its core through integrative solutions.\\" This stage suggests a mutual attempt by all actors involved to create a mean of ending the conflict. It is suggested by Rothman and Olson that since both parties have now come to recognize the other's identity through the two previous stages, \\"they can concretely explore collaboratively how the tangible issues ... of the conflict can be resolved without threatening the identity of the other.\\" The invention of possible means of solutions leads directly to the fourth stage. ===Action=== The fourth and final stage of the ARIA model addresses the \\"why\\" and \\"who\\" of the conflict, as well as the \\"how\\" of cooperation through the tangible \\"what\\" of solutions.Rothman, Jay and Marie L. Olson, \\"From Interest to Identities: Towards a New Emphasis in Interactive Conflict Resolution.\\" Journal of Peace Research, 2001; 38: p. 289e Here, the conflict resolution process based on identity is completed by the concrete outlining of future actions. This stage leads to the tangible resolution of the conflict. ==Protracted social conflict in Sri Lanka== Percentage of Sri Lankan Tamils per district based on 2001 or 1981 (italic) census The Sri Lankan conflict exists primarily between the two majority ethnic groups, the Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhist and represent around 74% of the population, and the Tamil, who are mostly Hindu, representing around 18%. The majority of Tamils live in northern and eastern provinces and claim them as their traditional homeland.Malhotra, Deepak and Sumanasiri Liyanage (2005) Long-Term Effects of Peace Workshops in Protracted Conflicts. Journal of Conflict Resolution 49(6), 908‚Äì24. Since its independence in 1948 there has been a conflict between Sinhalese, which gained control over the Sri Lankan government, and different Tamil separatist movements. Among the Sinhalese, the anti-Tamil chauvinism started to spread and the Tamils were more and more disadvantaged and excluded. The incidents escalated into a war in July 1983, after the island-wide pogrom against Tamils. Tamil secessionists saw the establishment of their own separate state as the only way for securing their people. The war, that has continued since then, has almost completely disrupted civil administration in the northern province and caused economic devastation of the whole country. As a consequence of this ethno-political violence around 65,000 people have been killed, hundreds of thousands injured, and millions displaced. Among various Tamil separatist groups that have emerged, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have risen as the dominant fighting force in Sri Lanka. Their tactics, proscribed as terrorist by many countries, are ruthless, brutal and highly efficient in eliminating their opposition. They run a parallel government in many areas of the north and east of Sri Lanka. Since the start of war there were some attempts to reach a ceasefire. In 2002 the Ceasefire agreement was signed, and the government agreed to disarm all paramilitary groups in the north and east. But hostilities continued and even intensified. Government security forces conquered the LTTE on May 19, 2009 ending the conflict. ==Protracted social conflict in Cyprus== The division of Cyprus Before the independence of Cyprus, the island's Greek and Turkish communities coexisted relatively peacefully. The major conflict began with the independence in 1960, when Greek community wanted a union (enosis) with Greece, to which the Turkish community opposed. The 1960 constitution brought a complex system of power-sharing, but both groups wanted to gain more advantages. When Greek Cypriots wanted to reduce autonomy and representation of Turkish Cypriots, the latter opposed it and intercommunal violence broke out. That led the two communities to embark on a hostile and protracted process of separation and segregation.Fisher, Ronald J. (2001) Cyprus: The Failure of Mediation and the Escalation of an Identity-Based Conflict to an Adversarial Impasse. Journal of Peace Research 38(3), 307‚Äì26. With the military coup in 1974 the situation erupted into a major crisis. Turkish military intervention followed and Turkish forces occupied around 38% of the northern part of the island. This invasion caused an exodus of about 160,000 Greek Cypriots to the south. Later voluntary regrouping of population resulted in another 10,000 Greek Cypriots leaving the northern part, and 40,000 Turkish Cypriots moving to the north, which created two homogeneous ethnic zones on the island.Fisher 2001: 311 In 1975 the northern part declared Turkish Federated State of Cyprus, which declared independence in 1983 as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognized only by Turkey. In 1990s the southern Republic of Cyprus applied for a membership in the European Union, and the Turkish Cypriots on the other side turned to Turkey. Although the Cyprus conflict now lasts for a long time, its resolution does not seem to be close. Numerous peace proposals and plans have been made, but more or less unsuccessful. The pre-1974 proposals of different federal or centralist arrangements failed as one or the other side rejected them. The division in 1974 changed the demographics of Cyprus dramatically, putting it in a position where federalist model would be the most appropriate. But again, because of opposing interests all the proposals failed. ==See also== * Balkanization * Criticism of multiculturalism * Homophily * Sectarian violence * Social polarization ==References== Category:Conflict (process) Category:Dispute resolution Category:Sectarian violence ","title":"Protracted social conflict"},{"id":"20185599","text":"Frank Morgan is an American mathematician and the Webster Atwell '21 Professor of Mathematics at Williams College.

He gained temporary fame for his work \\"Dancing the Parkway\\". ==Mathematical work== He is known for proving, in collaboration with Michael Hutchings, Manuel Ritor√©, and Antonio Ros, the Double Bubble conjecture, which states that the minimum-surface-area enclosure of two given volumes is formed by three spherical patches meeting at 120-degree angles at a common circle. He has also made contributions to the study of manifolds with density, which are Riemannian manifolds together with a measure of volume which is deformed from the standard Riemannian volume form. Such deformed volume measures suggest modifications of the Ricci curvature of the Riemannian manifold, as introduced by Dominique Bakry and Michel √âmery.D. Bakry and Michel √âmery. Diffusions hypercontractives. S√©minaire de probabilit√©s, XIX, 1983/84, 177‚Äì206. Lecture Notes in Math., 1123, Springer, Berlin, 1985. Morgan showed how to modify the classical Heintze-Karcher inequality, which controls the volume of certain cylindrical regions in the space by the Ricci curvature in the region and the mean curvature of the region's cross-section, to hold in the setting of manifolds with density. As a corollary, he was also able to put the Levy-Gromov isoperimetric inequality into this setting. Much of his current work deals with various aspects of isoperimetric inequalities and manifolds with density. ==PublicationsTextbooks=== *Calculus Lite. Third edition.

Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) is a measurement of antioxidant strength based on Trolox, measured in units called Trolox Equivalents (TE), e.g. micromolTE/100 g. Due to the difficulties in measuring individual antioxidant components of a complex mixture (such as blueberries or tomatoes), Trolox equivalency is used as a benchmark for the antioxidant capacity of such a mixture. Trolox equivalency is most often measured using the ABTS decolorization assay.R.; Pellegrini, N.; Pannala, A.; Yang, M.; Rice-Evans, C.

The squad is led by Corporal Williams, an obtuse NCO, and consists of nine infantrymen, one of whom, William Gunn, is plagued by PTS and mentally unbalanced. The novel focuses on the last hours of this group of doomed individuals, which will be killed or wounded in a fruitless attempt to occupy a section of the enemy front line. Gunn will go crazy, turning into the Brute of the title, and will kill the other two surviving soldiers in the bleak ending of the novel. ==Criticism== David Trotter, in The Cambridge Companion to The Literature of the First World War, maintains that O'Flaherty's book‚Äîwhich, unlike most British war novels, was written by an author of proletarian origin‚Äîis interesting inasmuch as it \\"intended to do justice to the brute's point of view\\" (35), where brute stands for working-class soldiers.The Cambridge Companion to The Literature of the First World War, ed. Vincent Sherry, Cambridge, Cambridge UP, 2005.

Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on November 5, 1893, he was the fourth son and fifth child of John and Gertrude Pitcairn.The family moved from Philadelphia to their newly built home, Cairnwood, in Huntingdon Valley in 1895. Pitcairn spent his early school years in the Bryn Athyn parish schools of the General Church of the New Jerusalem, which follows the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg. He received his high school diploma from the Academy of the New Church Boys College in 1913. After attending the University of Pennsylvania, Pitcairn made the decision to study at the Academy of the New Church Theological School. He graduated in June, 1918, with a Bachelor of Theology degree. == Early career == Ordained into the priesthood of the General Church in 1917, Pitcairn worked with the church missions and taught theology to African students in South Africa and Lesotho (then known as Basutoland). He served as Pastor of the Durban Society in Natal, South Africa, and later as Assistant Pastor of the Bryn Athyn Church. During this time, he also served as Acting Pastor of the Circle at Seine-et- Marne, France. Pitcairn taught art history, history of education, and a course on the \\"Human Organic\\" at the Academy College. == Establishment of a new church == In the late 1930s, doctrinal differences within the General Church led Pitcairn and several other church members to found a new branch of the New Church known as The Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma. In 1939, Pitcairn established a non-profit corporation for the purposes of promoting and maintaining the new church. He served as pastor of the Philadelphia Society of The Lord's New Church until 1960, when leadership of the church passed to Philip N.

Thomas Hoving, former Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, described meeting the Reverend Pitcairn in the course of negotiating the purchase of Garden at Sainte-Adresse by Claude Monet.Hoving, Thomas, Making the Mummies Dance, 1993, pp. 135-141, Touchstone, NY. While searching for a suitable portrait painter for church dignitaries‚ÄîBishop William Frederic Pendleton and Bishop Nathaniel Dandridge Pendleton‚ÄîPitcairn met the young artist, through the efforts of Ernst Pfeiffer, in 1921 at the home of the banker and art collector Nicolaas Urban. Impressed by Smit's style, Pitcairn purchased Marijke with White Feather Fan, a portrait of Urban's daughter. He subsequently met Maryke, the subject of the painting, and they were married in 1926. Theodore and Maryke (September 7, 1905 - November 10, 1978) were the parents of nine children. Maryke's mother, Berendina, married Philippe Smit in 1941 after her divorce from Nicolaas Urban (1929). Throughout the painter's life until his death in 1948 and even after that, Pitcairn acquired the majority of the artist's works. == Patron of the arts == Pitcairn's love of antiquities is evident in the art studio he built for Smit on the grounds of his estate in Bryn Athyn. Designed by famed Philadelphia architect George Howe, of Mellor Meigs & Howe, the building incorporates 12th century French stone columns and an Italian stone-carved fireplace. The heavy wooden doors are embellished with ironwork by the metalworker, Samuel Yellin. The studio now serves as the Chapel of The Lord's New Church. Many of Smit's paintings were hung in the chapel and in the Pitcairns' colonial-era home in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania. Pitcairn was a major benefactor of the Philadelphia Orchestra during the time Eugene Ormandy served as conductor. == Death == Pitcairn died at his home in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania on December 17, 1973.

This distinguishes wine from most other consumable goods. While wine is perishable and capable of deteriorating, complex chemical reactions involving a wine's sugars, acids and phenolic compounds (such as tannins) can alter the aroma, color, mouthfeel and taste of the wine in a way that may be more pleasing to the taster. The ability of a wine to age is influenced by many factors including grape variety, vintage, viticultural practices, wine region and winemaking style. The condition that the wine is kept in after bottling can also influence how well a wine ages and may require significant time and financial investment.R. Jackson \\"Wine Science: Principles and Applications\\" Third Edition pp. 431‚Äì489, 643‚Äì671 Academic Press 2008 R. Boulton, V. Singleton, L. Bisson, R. Kunkee Principles and Practices of Winemaking pp. 382‚Äì424 Springer 1996 New York The quality of an aged wine varies significantly bottle-by-bottle, depending on the conditions under which it was stored, and the condition of the bottle and cork, and thus it is said that rather than good old vintages, there are good old bottles. There is a significant mystique around the aging of wine, as its chemistry was not understood for a long time, and old wines are often sold for extraordinary prices. However, the vast majority of wine is not aged, and even wine that is aged is rarely aged for long; it is estimated that 90% of wine is meant to be consumed within a year of production, and 99% of wine within 5 years.Windows on the World Wine School: Frequently Asked Questions , Kevin Zraly: Q. Are all wines meant to be aged? KZ: No. It's a common misconception that all wines improve with age. In fact, more than 90 percent of all the wines made in the world are meant to be consumed within one year, and less than 1 percent of the world's wines are meant to be aged for more than 5 years. ==History== During antiquity Amphorae like this were used to store wine and sealing wax made possible its aging The Ancient Greeks and Romans were aware of the potential of aged wines. In Greece, early examples of dried \\"straw wines\\" were noted for their ability to age due to their high sugar contents. These wines were stored in sealed earthenware amphorae and kept for many years. In Rome, the most sought after wines ‚Äì Falernian and Surrentine ‚Äì were prized for their ability to age for decades. In the Book of Luke, it is noted that \\"old wine\\" was valued over \\"new wine\\" (). The Greek physician Galen wrote that the \\"taste\\" of aged wine was desirable and that this could be accomplished by heating or smoking the wine, though, in Galen's opinion, these artificially aged wines were not as healthy to consume as naturally aged wines.J. Robinson (ed.). The Oxford Companion to Wine, Third Edition, pp. 5‚Äì7. Oxford University Press, 2006. . Bottles with cork closure reinvented the process of wine aging. Following the Fall of the Roman Empire, appreciation for aged wine was virtually non-existent. Most of the wines produced in northern Europe were light bodied, pale in color and with low alcohol. These wines did not have much aging potential and barely lasted a few months before they rapidly deteriorated into vinegar. The older a wine got the cheaper its price became as merchants eagerly sought to rid themselves of aging wine. By the 16th century, sweeter and more alcoholic wines (like Malmsey and Sack) were being made in the Mediterranean and gaining attention for their aging ability. Similarly, Riesling from Germany with its combination of acidity and sugar were also demonstrating their ability to age. In the 17th century, two innovations occurred that radically changed the wine industry's view on aging. One was the development of the cork and bottle which again allowed producers to package and store wine in a virtually air-tight environment. The second was the growing popularity of fortified wines such as Port, Madeira and Sherries. The added alcohol was found to act as a preservative, allowing wines to survive long sea voyages to England, The Americas and the East Indies. The English, in particular, were growing in their appreciation of aged wines like Port and Claret from Bordeaux. Demand for matured wines had a pronounced effect on the wine trade. For producers, the cost and space of storing barrels or bottles of wine was prohibitive so a merchant class evolved with warehouses and the finances to facilitate aging wines for a longer period of time. In regions like Bordeaux, Oporto and Burgundy, this situation dramatically increased the balance of power towards the merchant classes. ==Aging potential== The Italian wine Tignanello is a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet franc ‚Äì varieties which usually have aging potential. There is a widespread misconception that wine always improves with age, or that wine improves with extended aging, or that aging potential is an indicator of good wine. Some authorities state that more wine is consumed too old than too young.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pp. 39‚Äì41 Abbeville Press 2003 Aging changes wine, but does not categorically improve it or worsen it. Fruitiness deteriorates rapidly, decreasing markedly after only 6 months in the bottle. Due to the cost of storage, it is not economical to age cheap wines, but many varieties of wine do not benefit from aging, regardless of the quality. Experts vary on precise numbers, but typically state that only 5‚Äì10% of wine improves after 1 year, and only 1% improves after 5‚Äì10 years. In general, wines with a low pH (such as pinot noir and Sangiovese) have a greater capability of aging. With red wines, a high level of flavor compounds, such as phenolics (most notably tannins), will increase the likelihood that a wine will be able to age. Wines with high levels of phenols include Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo and Syrah. The white wines with the longest aging potential tend to be those with a high amount of extract and acidity. The acidity in white wines, acting as a preservative, has a role similar to that of tannins in red wines. The process of making white wines, which includes little to no skin contact, means that white wines have a significantly lower amount of phenolic compounds, though barrel fermentation and oak aging can impart some phenols. Similarly, the minimal skin contact with ros√© wine limits their aging potential. After aging at the winery most wood-aged ports, sherries, vins doux naturels, vins de liqueur, basic level ice wines, and sparkling wines are bottled when the producer feels that they are ready to be consumed. These wines are ready to drink upon release and will not benefit much from aging. Vintage ports and other bottled-aged ports and sherries will benefit from some additional aging. Champagne and other sparkling wines are infrequently aged, and frequently have no vintage year (no vintage, NV), but vintage champagne may be aged. Aged champagne has traditionally been a peculiarly British affectation, and thus has been referred to as ' \\"the English taste\\",Vintage Champagne, Giles Fallowfield, Square Meal Magazine Spring 2006 though this term also refers to a level of champagne sweetness. In principle champagne has aging potential, due to the acidity, and aged champagne has increased in popularity in the United States since the 1996 vintage. A few French winemakers have advocated aging champagne, most notably Ren√© Collard (1921‚Äì2009). In 2009, a 184-year- old bottle of Perrier-Jou√´t was opened and tasted, still drinkable, with notes of \\"truffles and caramel\\", according to the experts. ===Little to no aging potential=== A guideline provided by Master of Wine Jancis Robinson * German QBAs * Asti and Moscato Spumante * Ros√© and blush wines like White Zinfandel * Branded wines like Yellow Tail, Mouton Cadet, etc. * European table wine * American jug & box wine * Inexpensive varietals (with the possible exception of Cabernet Sauvignon) * The majority of Vin de pays * All Nouveau wines * Vermouth * Basic Sherry * Tawny Ports * Kit wines made from mostly concentrated grape juice ===Good aging potential=== Master of Wine Jancis Robinson provides the following general guidelines on aging wines. Note that vintage, wine region and winemaking style can influence a wine's aging potential, so Robinson's guidelines are general estimates for the most common examples of these wines. * Botrytized wines (5‚Äì25 yrs) * Chardonnay (2‚Äì6 yrs) * Riesling (2‚Äì30 yrs) * Hungarian Furmint (3‚Äì25 yrs) * Loire Valley Chenin blanc (4‚Äì30 yrs) * Hunter Valley Semillon (6‚Äì15 yrs) * Cabernet Sauvignon (4‚Äì20 yrs) * Merlot (2‚Äì10 yrs) * Nebbiolo (4‚Äì20 yrs) * Pinot noir (2‚Äì8 yrs) * Sangiovese (2‚Äì8 yrs) * Syrah (4‚Äì16 yrs) * Zinfandel (2‚Äì6 yrs) * Classified Bordeaux (8‚Äì25 yrs) * Grand Cru Burgundy (8‚Äì25 yrs) * Aglianico from Taurasi (4‚Äì15 yrs) * Baga from Bairrada (4‚Äì8 yrs) * Hungarian Kadarka (3‚Äì7 yrs) * Bulgarian Melnik (3‚Äì7 yrs) * Croatian Plavac Mali (4‚Äì8 yrs) * Georgian Saperavi (3‚Äì10 yrs) * Madiran Tannat (4‚Äì12 yrs) * Spanish Tempranillo (2‚Äì8 yrs) * Greek Xynomavro (4‚Äì10 yrs) * Vintage Ports (20‚Äì50 yrs) ==Factors and influencesWine constituents=== The ratio of sugars, acids and phenolics to water is a key determination of how well a wine can age. The less water in the grapes prior to harvest, the more likely the resulting wine will have some aging potential. Grape variety, climate, vintage and viticultural practice come into play here. Grape varieties with thicker skins, from a dry growing season where little irrigation was used and yields were kept low will have less water and a higher ratio of sugar, acids and phenolics. The process of making Eisweins, where water is removed from the grape during pressing as frozen ice crystals, has a similar effect of decreasing the amount of water and increasing aging potential. In winemaking, the duration of maceration or skin contact will influence how much phenolic compounds are leached from skins into the wine. Pigmented tannins, anthocyanins, colloids, tannin- polysaccharides and tannin-proteins not only influence a wine's resulting color but also act as preservatives. During fermentation adjustment to a wine's acid levels can be made with wines with lower pH having more aging potential. Exposure to oak either during fermentation or after (during barrel aging) will introduce more phenolic compounds to the wines. Prior to bottling, excessive fining or filtering of the wine could strip the wine of some phenolic solids and may lessen a wine's ability to age. Storage conditions can influence a wine's aging ability. ===Storage factors=== The storage condition of the bottled wine will influence a wine's aging. Vibrations and heat fluctuations can hasten a wine's deterioration and cause adverse effect on the wines. In general, a wine has a greater potential to develop complexity and more aromatic bouquet if it is allowed to age slowly in a relatively cool environment. The lower the temperature, the more slowly a wine develops. On average, the rate of chemical reactions in wine double with each 18 ¬∞F (10 ¬∞C) increase in temperature. Wine expert Karen MacNeil recommends keeping wine intended for aging in a cool area with a constant temperature around 55 ¬∞F (13 ¬∞C). Wine can be stored at temperatures as high as 69 ¬∞F (20 ¬∞C) without long term negative effect. Professor Cornelius Ough of the University of California, Davis believes that wine could be exposed to temperatures as high as 120 ¬∞F (49 ¬∞C) for a few hours and not be damaged. However, most experts believe that extreme temperature fluctuations (such as repeated transferring of a wine from a warm room to a cool refrigerator) would be detrimental to the wine. The ultra-violet rays of direct sunlight should also be avoided because of the free radicals that can develop in the wine and result in premature oxidation.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pp. 79‚Äì82 Workman Publishing 2001 Wines packaged in large format bottles, such as magnums and 3 liter Jeroboams, seem to age more slowly than wines packaged in regular 750 ml bottles or half bottles. This may be because of the greater proportion of oxygen exposed to the wine during the bottle process. The advent of alternative wine closures to cork, such as screw caps and synthetic corks have opened up recent discussions on the aging potential of wines sealed with these alternative closures. Currently there are no conclusive results and the topic is the subject of ongoing research. ===Bottling factors=== Bottle shock One of the short-term aging needs of wine is a period where the wine is considered \\"sick\\" due to the trauma and volatility of the bottling experience. During bottling the wine is exposed to some oxygen which causes a domino effect of chemical reactions with various components of the wine. The time it takes for the wine to settle down and have the oxygen fully dissolve and integrate with the wine is considered its period of \\"bottle shock\\". During this time the wine could taste drastically different from how it did prior to bottling or how it will taste after the wine has settled. While many modern bottling lines try to treat the wine as gently as possible and utilize inert gases to minimize the amount of oxygen exposure, all wine goes through some period of bottle shock. The length of this period will vary with each individual wine. Cork taint The transfer of off-flavours in the cork used to bottle a wine during prolonged aging can be detrimental to the quality of the bottle. The formation of cork taint is a complex process which may result from a wide range of factors ranging from the growing conditions of the cork oak, the processing of the cork into stoppers, or the molds growing on the cork itself. ===Dumb phase=== During the course of aging, a wine may slip into a \\"dumb phase\\" where its aromas and flavors are very muted. In Bordeaux this phase is called the age ingrat or \\"difficult age\\" and is likened to a teenager going through adolescence. The cause or length of time that this \\"dumb phase\\" will last is not yet fully understood and seems to vary from bottle to bottle. ==Effects on wine== As vintage Port matures, sediments develop in the wine that are often left in the bottle when the wine is decanted. As red wine ages, the harsh tannins of its youth gradually give way to a softer mouthfeel. An inky dark color will eventually lose its depth of color and begin to appear orange at the edges, and eventually turn brown. These changes occur due to the complex chemical reactions of the phenolic compounds of the wine. In processes that begin during fermentation and continue after bottling, these compounds bind together and aggregate. Eventually these particles reach a certain size where they are too large to stay suspended in the solution and precipitate out. The presence of visible sediment in a bottle will usually indicate a mature wine. The resulting wine, with this loss of tannins and pigment, will have a paler color and taste softer, less astringent. The sediment, while harmless, can have an unpleasant taste and is often separated from the wine by decanting. During the aging process, the perception of a wine's acidity may change even though the total measurable amount of acidity is more or less constant throughout a wine's life. This is due to the esterification of the acids, combining with alcohols in complex array to form esters. In addition to making a wine taste less acidic, these esters introduce a range of possible aromas. Eventually the wine may age to a point where other components of the wine (such as a tannins and fruit) are less noticeable themselves, which will then bring back a heightened perception of wine acidity. Other chemical processes that occur during aging include the hydrolysis of flavor precursors which detach themselves from glucose molecules and introduce new flavor notes in the older wine and aldehydes become oxidized. The interaction of certain phenolics develops what is known as tertiary aromas which are different from the primary aromas that are derived from the grape and during fermentation. An aged Malmsey Madeira shows the color change that white wines go through as they age. As a wine starts to mature, its bouquet will become more developed and multi-layered. While a taster may be able to pick out a few fruit notes in a young wine, a more complex wine will have several distinct fruit, floral, earthy, mineral and oak derived notes. The lingering finish of a wine will lengthen. Eventually the wine will reach a point of maturity, when it is said to be at its \\"peak\\". This is the point when the wine has the maximum amount of complexity, most pleasing mouthfeel and softening of tannins and has not yet started to decay. When this point will occur is not yet predictable and can vary from bottle to bottle. If a wine is aged for too long, it will start to descend into decrepitude where the fruit tastes hollow and weak while the wine's acidity becomes dominant. The natural esterification that takes place in wines and other alcoholic beverages during the aging process is an example of acid-catalysed esterification. Over time, the acidity of the acetic acid and tannins in an aging wine will catalytically protonate other organic acids (including acetic acid itself), encouraging ethanol to react as a nucleophile. As a result, ethyl acetate ‚Äì the ester of ethanol and acetic acid ‚Äì is the most abundant ester in wines. Other combinations of organic alcohols (such as phenol-containing compounds) and organic acids lead to a variety of different esters in wines, contributing to their different flavours, smells and tastes. Of course, when compared to sulfuric acid conditions, the acid conditions in a wine are mild, so yield is low (often in tenths or hundredths of a percentage point by volume) and take years for ester to accumulate. ==Coates‚Äô Law of Maturity== Coates‚Äô Law of Maturity is a principle used in wine tasting relating to the aging ability of wine. Developed by the British Master of Wine, Clive Coates, the principle states that a wine will remain at its peak (or optimal) drinking quality for a duration of time that is equal to the time of maturation required to reach its optimal quality. During the aging of a wine certain flavors, aromas and textures appear and fade. Rather than developing and fading in unison, these traits each operate on a unique path and time line. The principle allows for the subjectivity of individual tastes because it follows the logic that positive traits that appeal to one particular wine taster will continue to persist along the principle's guideline while for another taster these traits might not be positive and therefore not applicable to the guideline. Wine expert Tom Stevenson has noted that there is logic in Coates' principle and that he has yet to encounter an anomaly or wine that debunks it.T. Stevenson \\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\\" p. 631 Dorling Kindersley 2005 ===Example=== An example of the principle in practice would be a wine that someone acquires when it is 9 years of age, but finds dull. A year later the drinker finds this wine very pleasing in texture, aroma and mouthfeel. Under the Coates Law of Maturity the wine will continue to be drunk at an optimal maturation for that drinker until it has reached 20 years of age at which time those positive traits that the drinker perceives will start to fade. ==Artificial aging== There is a long history of using artificial means to try to accelerate the natural aging process. In Ancient Rome a smoke chamber known as a fumarium was used to enhance the flavor of wine through artificial aging. Amphorae were placed in the chamber, which was built on top of a heated hearth, in order to impart a smoky flavor in the wine that also seemed to sharpen the acidity. The wine would sometimes come out of the fumarium with a paler color just like aged wine. Modern winemaking techniques like micro-oxygenation can have the side effect of artificially aging the wine. In the production of Madeira and rancio wines, the wines are deliberately exposed to excessive temperatures to accelerate the maturation of the wine. Other techniques used to artificially age wine (with inconclusive results on their effectiveness) include shaking the wine, exposing it to radiation, magnetism or ultra-sonic waves. More recently, experiments with artificial aging through high-voltage electricity have produced results above the remaining techniques, as assessed by a panel of wine tasters. Some artificial wine-aging gadgets include the \\"Clef du Vin\\", which is a metallic object that is dipped into wine and purportedly ages the wine one year for every second of dipping. The product has received mixed reviews from wine commentators. Several wineries have begun aging finished wine bottles undersea; ocean aging is thought to accelerate natural aging reactions as a function of depth (pressure). ==See also== * Ullage ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Suriano, Matthew, \\"A Fresh Reading for 'Aged Wine' in the Samaria Ostraca,\\" Palestine Exploration Quarterly, 139,1 (2007), 27‚Äì33. ==External links== * * * Category:Wine Category:Wine chemistry ","title":"Aging of wine"},{"id":"20185956","text":"Tergipedidae is a family of sea slugs, aeolid nudibranchs, marine gastropod molluscs in the superfamily Fionoidea (according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005). ==Taxonomic history== The genera in this family were moved to the family Fionidae as a result of a molecular phylogenetics study.Cella, K; Carmona Barnosi, L.; Ekimova, I; Chichvarkhin, A; Schepetov, D; Gosliner, T.

He graduated at Harvard in 1829 and was admitted to the Suffolk bar in October, 1832. ==Career== In 1838, Sohier formed a partnership with Charles A. Welch, which continued until his death. He was remembered as a profound lawyer, full of resources, forcible in argument, sharp in repartee and conscientious in his management of cases, \\"as witty as Sydney Smith and more agreeable.\\" At a meeting of the Suffolk bar to pay tribute to his memory, the presiding officer, Edward Bangs, said, \\"As a lawyer he stood among the first; as a man, his courtesy, his honesty, his untarnished honor, the severe strictness of his integrity, made him remarkable, even among associates abounding in such virtues.\\" He married, February 16, 1836, Hannah Louis Amory, and died November 23, 1888.William Thomas Davis, Bench and Bar of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Boston: The Boston History Company, 1895), pp. 211-212. ==Webster trial== He is best known for being the junior counsel with Pliny T.

Of medium build, his gray moustache and long sideburns framed > his semi-bald, handsome head. The wrinkles between and above his white > eyebrows gave indication of the seriousness of this man who was the founder > of ... one of Boston's most prestigious and probably oldest firms. Quiet by nature, fastidiously ethical and courteous to the court, Sohier was essentially a civil or commercial lawyer, a fiduciary rather than a criminal defense lawyer. It is unusual that in 1850 he defended in a trial which at that time was the most sensational murder trial in America's history.Robert Sullivan, The Disappearance of Dr. Parkman (Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1971), p.55 ==ReferencesArchives and records== *Sohier and Welch records at Baker Library Special Collections, Harvard Business School Category:1810 births Category:1888 deaths Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Lawyers from Boston ","title":"Edward Dexter Sohier"},{"id":"20186127","text":"SNCB's Class 12 locomotives were dual-voltage (25000 V, 50 Hz AC and 3000 V DC) electric lomotives built for cross-border service into France. They were based on the single-voltage Class 21 locomotives. They are part of the large 1980s family of 144 electric locomotives. ==Locomotive family== The family was made up of Classes 11 (12), 12 (12), 21 (60) and 27 (60). Classes 11, 12 and 21 were nearly twice as powerful as Classes 22, 23 and 25. Class 27 was more than twice as powerful as the 1950s locomotives. This family was heavily influenced by the Class 20¬≤ from the mid-1970s. They were very reliable because of the trial and error development of their predecessor. This family came into service with M4 and M5 coaching stock and the AM 80 and AM 86 series of EMUs. This generation was a major modernization of the SNCB even if the older M2 coaching stock remained active for more than a decade before being replaced. The only real difference between a Class 12 and a Class 21 was the Class 12 had a transformer inside to allow working under both 3000 V DC in Belgium and 25000 V AC plus French signalling and train protection for working in France. Externally they were identical except for a few details. ==Class 12== Class 12 was originally built to work freight and passenger services between Antwerp (via Gent) and Li√®ge (via Namur) in Belgium on one hand and Lille in France on the other. Class 12 spent most of its early years pushing and pulling rakes of M4 stock across Belgium. Sometimes they ventured onto other domestic services where their 25000 V capability wasn't needed. The introduction of the SNCB Class AM96 electric multiple units displaced them from passenger duty by 1999 but they continued to be used in freight service for 13 more years. Later on they pulled freight between the port of Zeebrugge to Lille and beyond, going via Brugge and Mouscron. They were withdrawn from service in 2012 because Class 13 locomotives had by then lost most of their passenger workings and were available for freight. Class 13 was more powerful and also had the same dual voltage capability as Class 12. All Class 12s were stored inside at the d√™pot of Stokkem, near Arlon, upon withdrawal. During 2013, locomotive 1203 went to the Czech Republic for service trials. In mid-2014, loco 1203 was intensively tested at Velim in the Czech Republic under 25000 V overhead and did very well. It was then sold to open access operator XTR-System Development in the Czech Republic with an option to buy the entire class. The option was taken and the remaining Class 12 locomotives left Belgium in March 2016 en route to their new owner. The same operator also agreed to buy all 12 of the SNCB Class 11 locomotives at the same time but the deal never went through and all Class 11 locomotives have been sitting outside at Stockem ever since. Class 12 underwent asbestos removal before they departed for the Czech Republic. XTR-System Development has also expressed an interest in buying at least some of the SNCB Class 21 locomotives as they are retired. At midnight on 06/3/2016 they arrived to ƒåesk√° T≈ôebov√° and next day continued to ƒåM≈ΩO at P≈ôerov for overhaul in order to run o S≈ΩDC network. After rebuilding they will be able to run on whole electrified network of ƒåR with exception of T√°bor-Bechynƒõ and Znojmo-Retz railways. As of July 2016 at least one of locomotives was painted in corporate livery of CZ Loko, was overhauled for cargo service, this means that its speed was decreased to 120kmph and train electrical heating was removed. The locomotive was also fitted with electrodynamic brake without recuperation.

The non-profit project also maintains a comprehensive directory of Canadian associations and NGOs. With the initiative of the Canadian Urban Training Project for Christian Service and financial support from the World Council of Churches, the project was founded in 1975 as a national information clearinghouse for grassroots activists involved with urban and rural poverty issues. The project was originally called the Canadian Information Sharing Service. In an initial consultation, Jim Morin, who worked with the Canadian News Synthesis publication, proposed a voluntary collective organization for the project and became the first coordinating editor, who focused upon publishing analytical abstracts of the diagnosis and strategies being developed by grassroots activists, in order to circulate their work on a national level to promote networking, learning and collaboration. The name was changed to Connexions in 1978 to more clearly identify the project's action- oriented goal of connecting grassroots activists with each other and with information, ideas, and issues. The scope of the project expanded to include Native rights, third world development, women's empowerment, peace, human rights, and other issues. The project disseminated information through the newsletter-format Connexions Digest, which received documents and materials from participants across the country, and distilled them into a subject- indexed summary format. Print-based for the first two decades of its existence, Connexions published more than 4,000 abstracts summarising the content of documents, articles, reports, and books, as well as profiles of organizations and projects, becoming in the process a resource and networking tool for Canadian activists and researchers concerned with social justice issues. In the 1980s and 1990s it published The Connexions Annual, a widely distributed sourcebook of social and environmental alternatives. The Connexions Annual's combined articles surveying current issues confronting movements for social change with lists of resources and directory listings and profiles of grassroots groups working for change. The last print edition of The Connexions Annual appeared in 1994. In the mid-1990s, Connexions moved online, and added new resources to its online library while pursuing an ongoing program of digitizing its print-based resources. Connexions Online hosts an online library of more than 7,000 documents related to human rights, civil liberties, social justice, economic alternatives, democratization, women's issues, gay, lesbian, and bisexual rights, First Nations and Native Peoples issues, alternative lifestyles, and environmental issues. In addition to using Library of Congress and Dewey Decimal subject classifications, Connexions also uses a controlled vocabulary database of more than 20,000 subject headings developed by Connexions in association with Sources, the Canadian directory of experts and spokespersons. Connexions has worked with Sources since 1993, when Sources publisher Barrie Zwicker, a media critic and peace activist, asked Connexions Co-ordinator Ulli Diemer to lead a joint project to develop an online directory of Canadian associations. The Connexions Directory of Associations, a separate resource also available on the Connexions site, now lists more than 5,000 organizations, indexed under more than 20,000 topics. Connexions also maintains the Connexions Calendar which lists Canadian events related to social change. Connexions produces an extensive compilation of materials on Israel and Palestine, featuring resources for \\"those who believe that a solution to the conflict is possible only on the basis of justice, equality, respect for human rights, mutual recognition and an end to Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories.\\" Connexions maintains other specialised collections, including a selection of political manifestos from 1776 to the present. Connexions hosts the complete archive of The Red Menace, a libertarian socialist newsletter published from 1976 to 1980 by the Libertarian Socialist Collective, as well as a partial archive of Seven News, a community newspaper founded by community activists associated with John Sewell, the Toronto alderman who later to become reform mayor of Toronto. ==Political Orientation== Connexions describes its political orientation as left-pluralism, that is, including a diversity of views on the progressive side of the political spectrum. The writers' guidelines observe that \\"our biases are reflected in which works we select for inclusion in Connexions, but within our selection guidelines, we endeavour to include materials taking different points of view and proposing a variety of goals and strategies. We try to provide our readers with neutral summaries of the works we abstract, leaving it to the readers to make their own judgments.\\" Connexions does identify the broad principles that guide its decisions about which kinds of materials to select for inclusion in the Connexions Library. As a rule, documents written from a Leninist, Trotskyist, or post-modernist perspective are not included. Connexions' principles include a strong commitment to civil liberties, human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, secularism, and democratic principles. Connexions declares itself opposed to censorship and to all forms of discrimination and oppression based on gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or race. ==Theology of Connexions== Connexions is a secular project unaffiliated with any religion, but church- based social activists played an important role in founding and developing the project, and funding through its early years came from church bodies in Canada and abroad, including the United Church of Canada, the Anglican Church of Canada, the Presbyterian Church of Canada, various Roman Catholic dioceses and religious orders, and the World Council of Churches. The work of Connexions inspired a number of individuals affiliated with the Canadian Theological Reflection Project to publish a theological reflection on the meaning of Connexions under the title A Theology of Connexions which was circulated among church bodies internationally. It observed that \\"Connexions has become something of a crossroads, a meeting place‚Äìa place where stories get told. On the page of Connexions, one hears the voices of the powerless and the abused, the disabled, prisoners, the unemployed, the underemployed, skid row residents, the poor, the psychiatric patients, Third World peoples, immigrants, workers, older persons, women, native peoples, etc. Connexions realizes that the stories of the poor and oppressed differ radically from those of the typical Canadian as portrayed in mainstream culture.\\" ==International internship program== Connexions runs a social justice internship program that receives interns and volunteers from many different countries. Interns work on developing the electronic archive, scanning documents and images, writing descriptions, and marketing. Connexions is in the process of translating its controlled-vocabulary search terms into French, Spanish, and German, and is looking for more volunteers to help with this.

One of the central founders of The Autocar Company, Clarke was also an inventor who made numerous contributions to the development of modern motor vehicles, including innovations in the use of the drive shaft, circulating motor oil, sparkplugs, and the American convention of placing a vehicle's steering wheel on the left. ==Family== Thomas Shields Clarke started out with a single river boat the ‚ÄúBeaver‚Äù in 1832, then by 1842 he and his brother in law William Thaw started Clarke and Co and by 1855 his son Charles joined the firm. Originally the firm was called Clarke and Thaw and over 15 years operated a fleet of steam boats which traveled all the way to New Orleans and was the designate shipping firm for all shipping west of Pittsburgh for the Pennsylvania Railroad. Louis was born into an influential family at an influential time in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, a time of great economic expansion and innovation for the region and country. The names with which the Clarkes associated themselves were Andrew Carnegie, Andrew Mellon and Henry Clay Frick all of whom were also members of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club. The club's dam broke in May 1889 causing the largest man-made disaster in US history at the time, the Johnstown flood. Louis was inspired at this time of innovation and took a keen interest in new inventions and technologies. Louis's inventive nature propelled him to build a handmade camera, with which he took many of the photos which are now part of the county's historical treasure trove. As an avid photographer he was the primary person who documented the SFFHC activities prior and after the dam's collapse in May 1889. The glass plates used to take the pictures surfaced 100 years later when his granddaughter in 1991 found them in the attic. At the time she called Charles Guggenheim who had just finished a documentary on the Johnstown flood and would win an Academy Award for short documentary in 1991. Additionally, the film was narrated by David McCullough who had also written a book The Johnstown Flood in 1968 with various pictures including a picture of Louis. Louis was probably the last man at the age of 22 to join the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, as his membership stock certificate is dated April 1889, although he attended the club under his father's membership since his father and various other members had founded the club in May 1879. He and other younger members were energetic about all things mechanical and given the times they placed a small steam engines on boats to cruise across Lake Conemaugh and often LS would dress up as a sailor and ‚Äúman‚Äù his station. ==The Autocar Company== LS was an educated engineer and in the 1890s started working with his brother Charles developing motorized vehicles resulting in the Pittsburgh Motor Vehicle Company supported by brothers, John S. and James K. Clarke along with their father Charles and friend William Morgan in 1897. Initial production included a motorized tricycle and a small car, which the brothers called ‚ÄúThe Pittsburgher.‚Äù In 1899, the name of the company was changed to ‚ÄúThe Autocar Company,‚Äù and operations were relocated to Ardmore, Pennsylvania, a western suburb of Philadelphia. In 1901 they produced what is considered to be this country's first multi-cylinder, shaft driven car. Initial sales brochures touted that it ‚Äúcannot blow up or burn up‚Äù as well as its ease of control, to the point he taught his wife to drive, making her the first known woman driver in the county. The new design was driven from Ardmore to the Madison Square Garden, New York City, in six hours and fifteen minutes, where it was exhibited in the New York Automobile Show of December 1901. The first eight hundred cars were equipped with steering levers, but new innovations helped the Autocar to generate another revolution in innovative design, placing the steering wheel on the left hand side of the car thus establishing the reason we currently drive on the right hand side of the road. Under the Clarke brothers, the company was an early innovator, developing the first American porcelain-insulated spark plugs‚Äì a process patented and later sold to Champion, and which still remains the basis for today's spark plugs. Other early developments included the first American shaft-driven vehicle, double- reduction gear drives, and the recirculating lube‚Äìoil system. They Clarkes contributed their engineering abilities toward the war effort with as Louis also designed a naval bomb fuse which was adopted as standard and also adapted for army use. His son Louis Phillips, or LP, during the war was responsible for detonating bombs in the US and France. ‚ÄúFor approximately the first ten years of the Autocar company's existence Clarke was president and chief engineer of the company. In later years he served the company as vice- president and consulting engineer. He sold his interest in the Autocar Co. in 1929 and retired at that time.‚ÄùNational Cyclopedia of American Biography ==Palm Beach== Charles John Clarke (1833-1899) was one of the pioneers of Palm Beach, where he established a winter residence in the early 1880s. Louis's father may have been a winter visitor to the Lake Worth area as early as 1885 when he appeared in a photo with hunting and fishing party near Jupiter lighthouse. He was from Pittsburgh, where he operated a fleet of boats providing transportation between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh with his partner and brother-in-law, William Thaw. Charles liked the area so much from his first visit that he and Louisa spent the winter of 1890 - 1891 at Elijah N. Dimick's ‚ÄúCocoanut Grove House‚Äù Palm Beach's only hotel at the time. The following winter, Clarke bought the hotel along with about of land from the Lake Trail to the ocean beach. He also bought more on the South Lake Trail, where the Society of the Four Arts stands today. This estate he named \\"Primavera\\" ('Springtime'). He then had constructed Palm Beach's first non- wooden residence, the first to have a genuine tile roof instead of wooden shingles, with white stucco outer walls instead of the usual shingles or clapboard. When the house was completed and landscaped at No. 8 South Lake Trail, he and Louisa moved in. Louis also bought property in Palm Beach in 1892. Located on his father's estate, he named it ‚ÄúDulciora\\", located on Lake Trail South, which is one of the most attractive estates at Palm Beach. His kept his summer home in Haverford, Pennsylvania. Additionally, his brother's Thomas Shields Clarke a famous artist of the time, John and James also purchased property and helped to establish the new community of West Palm Beach where they entertained their affluent friends from Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. By the 1920s West Palm had become the oasis of the East for the wealthy including the Kennedys. Louis had two children, Winifred and L. Phillips. Winifred, married a West Palm Beach pioneer, Roscoe Tait Anthony is credited with having started the first Sunday School in Palm Beach and L. Phillips Clarke was an architect and with his partner, Henry Stephen Harvey, they opened a West Palm Beach office in 1921 and designed many of the buildings in Palm Beach and West Palm Beach including the Comeau Building, the Murray Building, Guaranty Building, Gus‚Äô Baths, Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, and the Palm Beach County Library all of which represent the style of an aspiring time and most are on the national register for Spanish Colonial/Mission Revival design. The Autocar Company was purchased by White Motor Company in 1953 which continued to make Autocar Trucks and then was then purchased by Volvo in 1981 which continued make Autocar Trucks although they were called Volvo Autocar but still used the familiar bow tie name plate until 2001 when it was sold to Grand Vehicle Works Holdings which manufacturers refuse vehicles in Hagerstown Indiana. ==Late life== After retirement LS lived and died in West Palm Beach on January 6, 1957, survived by his two children and a multitude of grand and great grandchildren. ==See also== * White Motor Company * List of motorized trikes ==ReferencesSources== *https://web.archive.org/web/20070803161623/http://www.goldenagetruckmuseum.com/featured_truck.shtml *https://web.archive.org/web/20080509095109/http://www.jaha.org/FloodMuseum/club.pdf *https://web.archive.org/web/20081017061815/http://www.pennhighlands.edu/library/digital/clark.htm *http://www.nps.gov/archive/jofl/home.htm *https://web.archive.org/web/20090108233543/http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1992/7/1992_7_120.shtml *http://americanhistory.si.edu/onthemove/collection/object_1273.html *http://www.lwpa.org/pioneer_charles_john_clarke.html *https://web.archive.org/web/20080627020450/http://graylocke.tripod.com/tsclarke/id12.html ==External links== *Autocar Trucks Official website *Lowermerionhistory.org Autocar in Lower Merion Township *SFFHC Photos Photos by Clarke taken at the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club *Golden age of Trucks *SFFHC Member Listing *Lost Plates of the SFFHC Article *Lake Worth Pioneers *Thomas Shields Senior Clarke Reference *Thomas Shields Clarke Painter Sculptor *Profiles in Time Thomas Shields Clarke Senior * http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi- bin/t/text/pageviewer- idx?c=pitttext;cc=pitttext;q1=Thomas%20Shields%20clarke;rgn=full%20text;idno=00afq9167m;didno=00afq9167m;view=image;seq=980;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset Category:American automotive engineers Category:Businesspeople from Pittsburgh Category:1957 deaths Category:1866 births Category:Burials at Allegheny Cemetery Category:Engineers from Pennsylvania ","title":"Louis Semple Clarke"},{"id":"20186173","text":"Petals Network is a floral wire service company.

Feilong is a proper name, and is often used as a title for other ideas and objects. ==Word== The Chinese dragon name feilong combines fei or \\"fly; flying; hover; flutter\\" and long or \\"dragon\\". This loanword is pronounced as Japanese hiry≈´, Korean piyong , and Vietnamese philong. The inverted Longfei was an era name (396‚Äì399 CE) during the Later Liang Dynasty.Ingersoll,Ernest, et al., (2013). The Illustrated Book of Dragons and Dragon Lore. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN B00D959PJ0 The (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi, the first Chinese character dictionary, uses feilong to define da (written with 2 dragons) \\"flying dragon; appearance of a dragon in flight\\". ==Early references== Chinese classic texts frequently mention feilong \\"flying dragons\\". The examples below are roughly arranged in chronological order, although some heterogeneous texts are of uncertain dates. ===Yijing=== The (5th‚Äì3rd centuries BCE) Yijing \\"Book of Changes\\" first uses feilong to symbolize a daren \\"great person; accomplished person\\". Qian \\"The Creative\\", the first hexagram, says (tr. Wilhelm 1967:9), \\"Nine in the fifth place means: Flying dragons in the heavens. It furthers one to see the great man.\\" The \\"Commentary on the Decision\\" (, tr. Wilhelm 1967:371) explains, \\"Because the holy man is clear as to the end and the beginning, as to the way in which each of the six stages completes itself in its own time, he mounts on them toward heaven as though on six dragons.\\" And the \\"Commentary on the Images\\" (, tr. Wilhelm 1967:371) says, \\"'Flying dragon in the heavens.' This shows the great man at work.\\" Many later texts, such as the Zuozhuan, Shiji, and Hanshu histories, quote this \\"Flying dragons in the heavens\\" from the Yijing. ===Hanfeizi=== The (3rd century BCE) Hanfeizi (, tr. Ames 1983:74) quotes Shen Dao contrasting feilong with tengshe \\"ascending/floating snake\\" to explain the Legalist concept of shi \\"political power; strategic advantage\\". > Shen Tzu said: \\"The flying dragon mounts the clouds and the t'eng snake > wanders in the mists. But when the clouds dissipate and the mists clear, the > dragon and the snake become the same as the earthworm and the large-winged > black ant because they have lost that on which they ride. Where men of > superior character are subjugated by inferior men, it is because their > authority is lacking and their position is low. Where the inferior are > subjugated by the superior, it is because the authority of the latter is > considerable and their position is high. Ames notes this Shen Dao quotation \\"is very close both in wording and in substance to\\" the Shenzi () fragment, and \\"indeed, it could conceivably be an expansion and elaboration on it.\\" ===L√ºshi Chunqiu=== The (c. 3rd century BCE) encyclopedic L√ºshi Chunqiu ( \\"Music of the Ancients\\", tr. Knoblock and Riegel 2000:148) uses Feilong \\"Flying Dragon\\" as the name of a music master for the legendary ruler Zhuanxu > The Sovereign Zhuanxu was born at Ruo River and lived at Kongsang. Then he > ascended to become a Sovereign who was truly a match for Heaven. When the > winds true to the eight directions circulated, they made sounds like hya- > hya, tsied-tsied, and tsyang-tsyang. The Sovereign Zhuanxu, being fond of > these sounds, ordered Feilong to compose music in imitation of the Eight > Winds, naming them \\"Supporting the Clouds\\" and using them in the worship of > the Supreme Sovereign. He then ordered the [] water-lizard to lead them as > singing master, so the water-lizard reclined and, using his tail to beat his > belly, made the sound bung-bung. ===Zhuangzi=== Xian riding dragons, (Project Gutenberg eText 15250) The (3rd‚Äì2nd centuries BC) Daoist Zhuangzi (1, Watson 1968:33) describes a shenren \\"holy person\\" riding a feilong > He said that there is a Holy Man living on faraway Ku-she Mountain, with > skin like ice or snow, and gentle and shy like a young girl. He doesn't eat > the five grains, but sucks the wind, drinks the dew, climbs up on the clouds > and mist, rides a flying dragon, and wanders beyond the Four Seas. By > concentrating his spirit, he can protect creatures from sickness and plague > and make the harvest plentiful. ===Chuci=== The (3rd‚Äì2nd centuries BCE) Chuci uses feilong in two poems. The Li Sao \\"On Encountering Trouble\\" (tr. Hawkes 1985:77) says, > Harness winged dragons to be my coursers; Let my chariot be of fine work of > jade and ivory! How can I live with men whose hearts are strangers to me? I > am going a far journey to be away from them. The \\"Goddess of the Xiang\\" (tr. Hawkes 1985:107) mentions feilong twice. > North I go, drawn by my flying dragon, Steering my course to the Dong-ting > lake: My sail is of fig-leaves, melilotus my rigging, An iris my flag-pole, > my banner of orchids. Gazing at the distant Cen-yang mooring, I waft my > magic across the Great River. ... The stream runs fast through the stony > shallow, And my flying dragon wings swiftly above it. The pain is more > lasting if loving is faithless: She broke her tryst; she told me she had not > time. ===Huainanzi=== The (2nd century BCE) Huainanzi uses feilong in two chapters. \\"Evolution of Animals and Plants\\" (, tr. Major 1993:209, cf. Visser 1913:65) mentions feilong with yujia \\"winged excellence\\", fenghuang \\"phoenix\\", and luan \\"a legendary phoenix-like bird; simurgh\\". > Winged Excellence gave birth to Flying Dragon. Flying Dragon gave birth to > the phoenix (fenghuang). The phoenix gave birth to the simurgh (luan). The > simurgh gave birth to ordinary birds. Feathered creatures in general are > born from ordinary birds. Edward H. Schafer (1963:38, 288) first translated luan as simurgh \\"a giant winged creature in Persian mythology\\". \\"Generalship and the Prevention of Anarchy\\" (, tr. Morgan 1933:196) describes Daoist movement with the animal metaphors of luan, qilin (instead of yujia), fenghuang, and feilong. > The movements of the Tao-inspired are like a spirit's emergence and a > demon's action, unexpected and sudden, like the sudden shining of the stars > and their sinking into darkness again; like the rising of the fabulous bird > Luan, and the excitation of the Lin, like the flight of the phoenix or the > ascension of the dragon. ===Baopuzi=== The (c. 320 CE) Daoist Baopuzi by Ge Hong mentions Feilong \\"flying dragon\\" and uses it as a graphic variant for the draconic mountain spirit Feifei \\"fly fly\\" (see Eberhard 1968:58). Feilong occurs describing a Daoist xian \\"transcendent; immortal\\" (6, tr. Ware 1966:111), \\"When my eyes have square pupils and my ears grow from the top of my head; when, driving a flying dragon and riding a cloud of good fortune, I shall mount above the darted lightning and reach Lighted-from-below, how will you be able to interrogate me? If you see me, you will then cry out that it is a heaven or an earth deity, or a strange sort of man. It will never occur to you to say that I am something produced by mere study!\\" Feifei occurs with kui \\"a one-legged demon\\" in a list of shanxiao \\"mountain spirits\\" (l7, tr. Ware 1966:287), \\"Another is like a dragon, variegated in color and with red horns, the name being Fei-fei. Whenever one of these appears, shout its name, and it will not dare harm you.\\" ===Other texts=== Feilong occurs in many additional contexts. Carr (1990:115) cites two examples. The Xijingfu \\"Western Metropolis Rhapsody\\", by Zhang Heng (78‚Äì139 CE), used feilong as an alternate name for the mythical bird called longque \\"dragon sparrow\\". Bicheng \\"Collection of Notes\\", by Jiao Hong (1540‚Äì1620 CE), described the feilong as having \\"a dragon's head, phoenix's tail, and multicolored patterns\\", and equated it with the wind god Feilian . ==Proper names== Draco volans Flying Dragon at the Art Institute of Chicago Feilong, Hiry≈´, and Flying Dragon commonly occur in names. Chinese Feilong (flying dragon) is also used to name: *Feilong, a jumping kick in martial arts *Feilong, a British-built gunboat in the Guangdong Fleet *Fei Long (FL), a family of Silkworm missiles (e.g., the C-101) *Fei-Long, a video game character in the Street Fighter series *Fei Long, a tribe in Survivor: China television series *FEILONG, call sign of China Flying Dragon Aviation *Fei lung maang jeung () or Dragons Forever, a Hong Kong action cinema *Yang Feilong (), a 3rd-century ruler of Chouchi *Fu Feilong (), a 4th-century deputy of Fu Pi *Ling Fei-long (), a character in the Dragon Fist manga *Liu Fei Long (), a character in Target in the Finder manga Japanese Hiry≈´ (flying dragon) names: *Hiry≈´, a Japanese aircraft carrier *Hiry≈´, a type of Mitsubishi Ki-67 medium bomber *Hiry≈´, a chess piece in Dai shogi *Hiry≈´ no ken () Flying Dragon, a video game *Hiry≈´002, a train in The Galaxy Railways anime series English has additional Feilong \\"Flying Dragon\\" names. *Feilongus, a genus of pterosaurs *Feilongshania, a genus of trilobites *Flying dragon or Draco volans, a species of Agaminae gliding lizards *Flying Dragon, a sculpture by Alexander Calder ==References== *Ames, Roger T. 1983.

They are notable for being one of the first metal, extreme metal bands to emerge from Singapore ==Biography== Impiety was originally formed in January 1990 by guitarist/bassist/vocalist Shyaithan and drummer Necro-Angelfornicator, originally heavily influenced by the likes of Hellhammer, Sarc√≥fago, Possessed, Destruction, Bathory, Angelcorpse and early Morbid Angel. The two recorded a rehearsal demo/promo in early 1991, but this was never officially released. After a few line-up changes, the band (now consisting of Shyaithan with guitarist Xxxul and drummer Iblyss) recorded its first official demo, in the form of 1992's Ceremonial Necrochrist Redesecration, which made a name for the band amongst underground tape-traders. Xxxul left Impiety in 1993, to be replaced by Iblyss' brother Leprophiliac Rex on guitars. This new trio signed to Shivadarshana Records, and recorded their first 7\\" single, Salve the Goat... Iblis Excelsi in 1993, which proved to be a great improvement in both sound and execution; the single was later licensed to the American label Fudgeworthy, who pressed it onto marbel vinyl. Following the release of Salve the Goat..., Impiety once again underwent a line-up change, bolstering their sound with the addition of Almarhum Abyydos taking over all lead and rhythm guitars, Rex moving to bass and Shyaithan performing vocals. They recorded their debut album, Asateerul Awaleen, once again for Shivadarshana, in 1994. Despite its raw production, the album received positive reviews within the metal press. A five-song MCD, Funeralight, was also recorded for release in early 1997, but as Shivadarshana had folded the EP only saw the light as a limited edition cassette through the Malaysian label Ultra-Hingax, until Agonia's 2007 re-release. Shortly afterwards, Iblyss and Abyydos left the group, Abyydos to fulfill his national service requirements, and Shyaithan recruited new members for live shows in early 1997. This new line-up, consisting of Shyaithan (vocals), guitarist Fyraun 95 and ex-Libation drummer Dajjal Yang Maseh Dara (with session bassist, Abattory's Kravnos), recorded Impiety's breakthrough album, Skullfucking Armageddon, in 1999. A considerable improvement over previous efforts, the record was initially released through Dies Irae Records, but subsequently through the cult French label Drakkar and Germany's Iron Pegasus Records, the latter on limited edition vinyl and picture disc. Dajjal left the band shortly after the recording to join death metallers Abattoir, in turn to be replaced on drums by ex-Abhorer and Abattoir member Dagoth. Around this time, the band also released a split 7\\" EP with Paul Ledney's US group Profanatica, through US label Samhain Records. In 2000, further line-up changes were to trouble the band when Fyraun 95 left the band, allegedly imprisoned for two years for possession of heroin prior to a planned Asian and European tour. However, with the addition of former guitarist Xxxul and new bassist Demonomancer, Impiety undertook their Asian Hell tour and the four-date European mini-tour Skullfucking Euro Armageddon 2000 over the summer. Two months after returning to Singapore, drummer Dagoth left the band to join Demonification and was replaced by Fauzzt (of Hail), before Impiety returned to Europe for the 15-date, six country Skullfucking Euro Battlestorms 2000 tour, courtesy of Drakkar (who re-released the album to coincide with the tour). The tour was successful and led to the band signing a three-album deal with French label Osmose in 2001, though both Xxxul and Demonomancer left following the tour. Impiety recorded their third album, Kaos Kommand 696, in three weeks during July 2002 at Berno Studios in Sweden. The recording line-up consisted of Shyaithan (bass/vocals), Fauzzt (drums) and the returning Fyraun (guitar). Extensive touring followed, particularly in South-East Asia, including such festivals as the Annual God Beheading Live Ritual (Bangkok, Thailand), Formoz Open Air Festival (Taiwan) and the Under the Black Sun festival in Germany. Both Fauzzt and Fyraun left in December 2003, and the decision was made to leave Osmose. Shyaithan set up an international line-up by recruiting the Mexican musicians Oscar Garcia (Hacavitz drummer) and Antimo Buonnao (Blood Reaping and Hacavitz lead guitarist) to the Impiety fold in 2004. The band also signed a two album deal with Polish label Agonia around the same time. The new line-up recorded three songs at Ambox Studios in Quer√©taro, Mexico, that were released as Impiety's half of the Two Majesties split EP with Thai act Surrender of Divinity (Unholy Horde Records, 2004). After the recruitment of Blood Reaping's Eduardo Guevara, Impiety recorded the eight tracks of their fourth album, Paramount Evil, at Ambox Studios in 2004. Reception was again positive and further touring ensued, including the nine- date Mexican Assault Tour in August 2004 and a five-date Asian Desecration Tour during December 2004 ‚Äì January 2005. Following the cancellation of a number of European tours in 2004 and 2005, Shyaithan was forced to call an end to his Mexican alliance in mid-2006 owing to the costs associated with the large distances prohibiting rehearsing, recording and playing live. A new Asian line-up consisting of Shyaithan, Arbitrary Element's Tremor (drums), Dusk's Iron Shaikh (bass) and Absence of the Sacred's Mike Priest (guitars) was brought together and resulted in the Tormentors of Tijuana live album on Japan's cult Heavy Metal Super Star Records (2007) and the studio effort Formidonis Nex Cultus, once again for Agonia. In 2008, Impiety released the 18 Atomic Years ‚Äì Satanniversary double CD through Pulverised and double LP through Agonia. This was followed by an Impiety/Abhorrence split 7\\" EP, featuring exclusive tracks. Later in 2008, a new 5 track MCD entitled Dominator was released. The band headlined its own 23 date European tour soon after. The sixth album Terroreign was released in 2009, featuring Rangel Arroyo of Abhorrence of guitar. In February 2010 a new EP called Goatfather was released via Basement Records. The months after, a tour of 22 dates followed throughout Europe accompanied by Swedish black metal band Setherial. In the meantime, HMSS released a second live LP, Tormentors of Nagoya, which was recorded a few months before. Later, the band announced a seventh album entitled Worshippers of the Seventh Tyranny, featuring Fabio Zperandio as a special guest on guitar solos; the album was released on 24 January 2011. The band released their next studio album, Ravage & Conquer, in 2012. Impiety released their first studio album in eight years, Versus All Gods, on January 20, 2020. They are currently working on a follow-up album. ==Controversy== Impiety was accused of supporting Nazism and anti-Semitism without any factual basis due to their depiction of Auschwitz and the practices of Josef Mengele in the lyrics of the song \\"Carbonized\\" on their album Paramount Evil (2004). Shyaithan denied all allegations and clarified that they are anti-religion instead. ==Line-up Current line-up === * Shyaithan (1990‚Äìpresent; vocals, bass) (formerly guitar) * Iszar ‚Äì (2017‚Äìpresent; guitars) * Nizam Aziz - (2012-present; guitars) * Dizazter ‚Äì (2011‚Äìpresent; drums) ===Former members=== Guitar: * Xxxul (1991‚Äì1993; 2000) * Leprophiliac Rex (1993‚Äì1994; also of Libation) * Al-Marhum Abyydos (1994‚Äì1997) * Fyraun (1997‚Äì2000, 2002‚Äì2003; also of Profancer, Sadiztik Impaler, Xasthur (Sgp)) * Antimo Buonnano (2004‚Äì2006; also of Blood Reaping, Demonized (Mex), Disgorge (Mex), Domain (Mex), Hacavitz, Profanator, Ravager) * Eduardo Guevara (2004‚Äì2006; also of Blood Reaping, Cenotaph (Mex), Hacavitz, Raped God 666, Rapture (Mex)) * Mike Priest (2007‚Äì2008; also of Absence of the Sacred) * Itaru Sayashi (2009‚Äì2010; also of Cohol) * Rangel Arroyo (2008‚Äì2009, 2009‚Äì2010; also of Abhorrence (Bra)) * Eskathon ‚Äì (2010‚Äì2011) * Guh Lu ‚Äì (2010‚Äì2012) * Deimos ‚Äì (2011; also Livyatan) Bass: * Leprophiliac Rex (1994‚Äì1997; also of Libation) * Kravnos (session, 1999; also of Abattory) * Demonomancer (2000‚Äì2007; also of Balberith) * Iron Shaikh (2007; also of Dusk (Pak), Northern Alliance) * A War (Andrea Cipriani) (2010; also of Dismorf, Imposer) * Guh Lu (2012) Drums: * Necro-Angelfornicator (1990‚Äì1991) * Iblyss (1991‚Äì1997; also of Abhorer, As Sahar) * Dajjal (1997‚Äì1999; also of Abattory) * Dagoth (1999‚Äì2000; also of Abattory, Abhorer, Profancer, Xasthur (Sgp)) * Fauzzt (2000‚Äì2003; also of As Sahar, Chaos Regal, Hail, Kibosh, Sibyl Kismet, Meltingsnow, Rejex) * Tremor (2007‚Äì2009; also of Arbitrary Element, Battlestorm, Bunuh, Cardiac Necropsy, Dusk (Pak), Ilemauzar, Sihir, Soul Devour, Wormrot, Zushakon) * Akihiro Tsunoda (2009‚Äì2010; also of Woundeep) * Oscar Garcia (2004‚Äì2006, 2007, 2009‚Äì2010; also of Demonized (Mex), Domain (Mex), Hacavitz, Ravager) * Andrea Janko (2010) * Atum (2010‚Äì2011) * Maelstrom (2011) * Disaster (2011 ‚Äì ) == Discography  Demos === * Rehearsal Demo (demo, 1991) * Ceremonial Necrochrist Redesecration (demo, 1992) === EPs === * Salve The Goat...Iblis Exelsi (EP, Shivadarshana Records, 1993) * Funeralight (EP, Ultra-Hingax, 1997; reissued by Agonia Records, 2006) * Unholy Masters of Darkness (split 7\\" EP with Profanatica, Samhain Records, 1999) * Two Majesties: An Arrogant Alliance of Satan's Extreme Elite (split 7\\" EP with Surrender of Divinity, Unholy Horde Records, 2004) * Two Barbarians (split 7\\" EP with Abhorrence, Agonia Records, 2008) * Dominator (EP, Pulverised Records, 2008) * Goatfather (EP, Basement Records, 2010) * Advent of ...

He is one of two players from Florida State University to win that award. The other is Marshall McDougall. In 1968, he went 5-0 with a 2.17 ERA. He went 11-2 with a 2.09 ERA in 1969. His 1970 collegiate was perhaps one of the best ever in NCAA history. He won 15 games and lost none for a record of 15-0, and his ERA was 0.66, the lowest all-time in a single season. He had a string of 41 scoreless innings, and another string of 29 scoreless innings. Furthermore, he also holds the record for most shutouts in a season, with eight. At one point, he threw a no-hitter. He also holds the record for lowest ERA in a career, posting a career 1.45 ERA while attending FSU. Overall, his career record at FSU was 31-2. Prior to pitching collegiately, he attended Lakeside High School. Ammann was drafted twice. The first time, he was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles in the 55th round of the 1967 draft. He chose not to sign. After being drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the third round of the 1970 draft, he did sign. He played professionally for five seasons, never reaching the majors. In his first professional season (1970), he played for the Jacksonville Suns, going 1-5 with a 2.85 ERA in 11 games. From 1971 to 1973, he played for the Evansville Triplets. In 1971, he went 6-10 with a 3.79 ERA in 25 games. In 1972, he went 9-10 with a 3.92 ERA in 30 games. Finally, in 1973, he went 8-8 with a 5.68 ERA in 26 games. In 1974, he played for the Hankyu Braves in Japan. He appeared in only one game, after which he was released; a report noted a lack of a fastball as the reason for his lack of success. In 1991, he was inducted into the FSU Sports Hall of Fame. ==References *Japan Baseball Daily *Florida State University *Biography Category:Florida State Seminoles baseball players Category:1949 births Category:College World Series Most Outstanding Player Award winners Category:Living people Category:Hankyu Braves players Category:American expatriate baseball players in Japan ","title":"Gene Ammann"},{"id":"20186359","text":"Stuart Oliver, at the Buddh International Circuit in India at the T1 Prima Truck Racing Championship Stuart Oliver (born 2 July 1963 in Hexham) is a British auto racing driver, who races in Truck Racing, where he has won many titles.

He raced in a Lexus IS200 for BTC Racing, but the car was both uncompetitive and unreliable, and he only drove in the first part of the season with no points. ===T1 Prima Truck Racing Championship=== At the inaugural T1 Prima Truck Racing Championship held by Tata Motors at the Buddh International Circuit in India, Stuart Oliver was crowned the first ever champion after winning both races on the single race day of the weekend long event. Stuart stated ‚ÄúIt was an amazing experience. The track is beautiful and trucks were performing great. I am thrilled to have won the first ever truck racing championship in India, among the enthusiastic crowd who were cheering each time we drove past the grand stand. I see a lot of potential of this sport here and would love to come back and race again.‚Äù The T1 Prima Truck Racing Championship comprised two races, a 5-lap Sprint Race and a 15-lap Main Race, with the Champion Award granted to the winning driver on the basis of combined points from both the races. The Team Championship was awarded on the basis of the combined scores of the two drivers of the respective teams from both the races. All the 12 Tata Prima trucks were Indian but were heavily modified, capable of putting out 370 hp and reaching a top speed of 110 km per hour (limited by FIA) driven by experienced drivers from BTRC.

It was also known as Blackpool Municipal Airport, and was in use for civil and military flying from 1929 until closure of the airfield in 1947. The site is now used by Blackpool Zoo. ==Early history== Despite the existence of the Squires Gate site, now Blackpool Airport, which had been used intermittently for flying since October 1909, Blackpool Corporation decided in 1928 to build a new airfield close to Stanley Park. The aerodrome was located east south east of North Pier at an elevation of above sea level. It occupied of a site acquired by the Corporation for aviation and sports use under the Blackpool Improvement Act 1928. The aerodrome was completed, licensed and opened for use in August 1929. After the erection in early 1931 of a hangar and a clubhouse and offices with an observation/control tower on top, the aerodrome was officially opened on 2 June 1931 by the Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. The all-grass airfield's surface was small with the longest landing run available (NW/SE) being in length. ==Early operations== Spartan Mailplane Blackpool in 1932, before its flight from Stanley Park Aerodrome to Karachi For the first few years the airfield was used aircraft owned by private individuals and flying clubs. These were housed in an art deco hangar and terminal building, parts of which still survive in use within Blackpool Zoo. On 15 June 1932, T. Neville Stack departed from the aerodrome at the controls of Spartan Mailplane G-ABLI on the first leg of a flight to Karachi, India, carrying two passengers. After being named Blackpool, the aircraft was given a civic send-off and reached Drigh Road aerodrome 5 days 23 hours 50 minutes later.Jackson, 1974, p. 188 A public Air Pageant was held at Stanley Park on 26 June 1932. Another public event was held on 7 September 1935 during which Alan Cobhams National Aviation Day Circus performed. Pleasure flights were available to the public, but tragedy ensued when an Avro 504 biplane of Air Travel Ltd collided over the outskirts of Blackpool, with Cobham's Westland Wessex monoplane. The pilot and two sisters from Blackpool were killed in the Avro, but the pilot of the Wessex skillfully brought his aircraft and four passengers to a non-fatal crash- landing. ==Inter-war airline operationsUnited Airways Ltd=== United Airways used this A.W. Argosy on pleasure flights from the aerodrome during 1935 The first scheduled air services from Stanley Park Aerodrome were operated by the short-lived United Airways to Hall Caine Airport, Isle of Man, during the summer of 1935 using eight-seat de Havilland Dragons.Isle of Man Examiner. Friday 26 April 1935.During summer 1935, United Airways flew an ex Imperial Airways Armstrong Whitworth Argosy G-AACJ on pleasure flights from the airfieldJackson, 1973, p. 404and on occasion, when passenger numbers warranted, to the Isle of Man (Hall Caine). The Argosy was a large three- engined 20-seat biplane airliner, which had been built in 1929. Whitehall Securities Corporation, owners of United Airways and their sister airline Spartan Air Lines began to build on their fledgling operation, introducing a schedule from London (Heston Aerodrome) via Stanley Park Aerodrome, Hall Caine and then onwards to Dublin (Collinstown).Isle of Man Examiner. Friday 26 April 1935. ===Railway Air Services=== Railway Air Services (RAS) had operated schedules from Squires Gate from April 1935, but their flights moved to Stanley Park Aerodrome on 1 June 1937. From 26 September 1937, RAS operations from Blackpool were transferred to Isle of Man Air Services (IoMAS) and these continued until the outbreak of World War II, again operated by Dragon Rapides. Some RAS/IoMAS scheduled flights from Ronaldsway Airport, Isle of Man continued from Stanley Park Aerodrome to Speke Airport, Liverpool and Manchester's Barton Aerodrome. The scheduled services through Stanley Park Aerodrome were not resumed after the war, the now larger Squires Gate airfield again being used. ==Operations in World War II== The airfield was requisitioned at the start of the war and was initially used by the Royal Air Force No.3 School of Technical Training, which used various types of grounded aircraft, including Armstrong Whitworth Whitleys, which were dispersed around the airfield boundary. Vickers-Armstrongs (VA) established a major aircraft shadow factory at Squires Gate in 1940 for the production of large numbers of Vickers Wellington medium bombers. Vickers took over most of the existing facilities at Stanley Park Aerodrome and used them, and five newly erected temporary Bellman hangars, to house a secondary assembly line. Because of the airfield's short grass runways, the Wellingtons landed at the larger Squires Gate facility after their maiden flights. A total of 2,584 Wellingtons were completed at the two Blackpool aerodromes between September 1940 and summer 1945. Lancashire Aircraft Corporation (LAC) established an aircraft repair line at Stanley Park Aerodrome which overhauled Bristol Beaufighters for return to service with the RAF. Later, some Hawker Hurricanes were flown in and reduced to scrap metal. No.181 Gliding School RAF used Kirby Cadet gliders at Stanley Park Aerodrome between 1943 and 1947 to train air cadets. ==Postwar activities== A limited amount of charter flying was performed from Stanley Park Aerodrome during early 1946 by LAC using de Havilland Dragon Rapide biplane airliners. However, the airline transferred to the better facilities at Squires Gate and flying from Stanley Park Aerodrome ceased in 1947. However, although seemingly undocumented, the airfield was busy after that date. The 1952 Aerial Survey of the UK shows the runways still visible and numerous aircraft around the hangars waiting to be scrapped. There are at least 35 folded wing Seafires visible with 13 dispersal stains showing where aircraft have been removed for scrapping. In addition there are around 30 Spitfires/Seafires and at least 6 other aircraft to be seen in the photograph. Until 1970, the site was used to stage the Royal Lancashire Agricultural Show. In that year, the site was acquired for the construction of Blackpool Zoo, which opened to the public in 1972. Several extra large buildings were erected, with the pre-war aerodrome terminal building and hangar and three wartime hangars also being utilised by the zoo. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * Category:Airports in Lancashire Category:Defunct airports in England Category:Buildings and structures in Blackpool ","title":"Stanley Park Aerodrome"},{"id":"20186384","text":"Private Lives is a 1931 American pre-Code comedy film directed by Sidney Franklin. The screenplay by Hanns Kr√§ly and Richard Schayer is based on the 1930 play Private Lives by No√´l Coward. ==Plot== Elyot Chase and Amanda Prynne, divorced after a tempestuous marriage, are dismayed to discover they both have opted to honeymoon with their new spouses at the same hotel on the French Riviera. Elyot finds his bride Sybil's questions about Amanda annoying, while Amanda wishes her new husband Victor would stop referring to Elyot every chance he gets. When Elyot discovers Amanda on the terrace their adjoining suites share, he insists he and Sybil immediately depart for Paris, the same plan Amanda proposes to Victor. The two ex-spouses quarrel with their new mates, both of whom set off in search of peace and quiet. Left to reminisce, Elyot and Amanda rekindle their relationship with a kiss and make a pact to put an end to any verbal battles when either one utters the name \\"Solomon Isaacs.\\" The two then abandon and flee to St. Moritz, but before long they begin a spat that evolves into a major fight about a phonograph record, which Amanda breaks over Elyot's head, an action that leads to total destruction of their hotel room. Rushing out, Amanda meets Victor and Sybil, who have tracked down the prodigal duo, and everyone becomes involved in the dispute. Things finally calm down, and the two couples meet for breakfast the next day, but when Victor and Sybil begin to fight, Elyot and Amanda walk out and depart the resort by train. ==Cast== * Norma Shearer as Amanda Prynne * Robert Montgomery as Elyot Chase * Reginald Denny as Victor Prynne * Una Merkel as Sibyl Chase * Jean Hersholt as Oscar * George Davis as Bell Hop ==Production== When No√´l Coward's play proved to be a hit both in London and on Broadway, MGM executive Irving Thalberg bought the rights for a film adaptation starring his wife, Norma Shearer. Coward was uncertain if Shearer was capable of handling the sophisticated dialogue of his comedy of manners, but the actress confidently proclaimed, \\"I don't care what he thinks - he thinks in theater terms - I think in film terms. It doesn't seem to occur to Mr. Coward that we both may turn out to be right!\\" She personally suggested Robert Montgomery, who already had appeared in three films opposite her, for her co-star. The studio filmed a performance of the play with Coward and Gertrude Lawrence, which the director and cast closely followed. According to Coward biographer Cole Lesley, the playwright was pleased with the outcome and described the leading performers as \\"perfectly charming.\\" The film's critical acclaim and financial success proved instrumental in helping Coward sell the film rights to several other plays.Private Lives at Turner Classic Movies Exteriors were filmed in Franklin Canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains and Glacier National Park, Montana. The song \\"Someday I'll Find You,\\" sung by Shearer and frequently heard as an underscore on the soundtrack, was written by Coward. ==Critical reception== Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times called the film \\"a swift and witty picture\\" and \\"one of the most intelligent comedies that has come to the screen.\\" He added, \\"Sidney Franklin's direction is excellent and Norma Shearer as Amanda Prynne gives an alert, sharp portrayal . . . Robert Montgomery struggles with matters at the outset, but he soon succeeds in doing well enough with his r√¥le . . . Una Merkel and Reginald Denny both deserve a great deal of credit for their work.\\" ==References* * Category:1931 films Category:1931 romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American films based on plays Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:Films directed by Sidney Franklin Category:Comedy of remarriage films Category:Films produced by Irving Thalberg Category:Films made before the MPAA Production Code Category:1931 comedy films ","title":"Private Lives (film)"},{"id":"20186408","text":"\\"Planets of the Universe\\" is a song by American singer/songwriter Stevie Nicks.

Candee went to New Haven at the age of fifteen after receiving a minimal education at the local school in Oxford, Connecticut. There he obtained employment first with a Gad Peck who was a merchant in foreign trade. His next position was with a firm named Root & Atwater. They were dealers in dry-goods. This began his twenty-five-year career with the dry-goods business. Candee soon organized the firm of \\"Candee, Dean & Cutler\\" with two co-workers named James E. P. Dean and William Cutler. They then took over the business of their employer. Candee retired from the company in 1833 and moved to New York. In New York Candee he was a partner in a dry-goods jobbing house for two years. He then returned to New Haven in 1835 and entered into a partnership with Timothy Lester and Abraham Murdock. They all formed a general merchandise business which they ran for a few years before they dissolved it. Candee was then interested in the manufacture of book paper at Westville, Connecticut which he did for several years. This firm was called \\"Candee, Page & Lester\\" and later changed to \\"Candee & Lester.\\" The business was unsuccessful and failed in 1842. It wiped out Candee's fortune he had accumulated over a period of twenty-five years. Candee then started manufacturing elastic suspenders. He became interested in rubber and rubber products. In the same year of his previous business failure he started to manufacture rubber footwear. Charles Goodyear offered Candee a license to use the rubber vulcanization process he had just discovered. Henry and Lucius Hotchkiss of New Haven put up the money to put Candee into the manufacture of rubber footwear at Hamden, Connecticut. 200px Candee became the first person in the world to manufacture rubber footwear.Atwater, Edward E., History of the City of New Haven to the Present, 1887, p. 591 \\"Candee became the first person in the world to manufacture rubber over-shoes under the Goodyear Patent.\\"Kane, Joseph Nathan, Famous First Facts‚ÄîA Record of First Happenings, Discoveries and Inventions in the United States, H .

These first overshoes were crude and needed much refining which his early years of manufacture took up in research and development. Candee improved the market for his rubber footwear and by the late 1840s his firm was on good footings. The name of the firm was established in 1852 as \\"Candee & Company\\" which consisted of four partners; the Hotchkiss brothers, Timothy Lester, and Candee as president. ==FootnotesReferences== * Faulkner, Harold Underwood, Dictionary of American Biography.

The victims were murdered by a group led by Rondell \\"Fineman\\" Rawlins. After carrying out another massacre when they attacked the town of Bartica, Essequibo, and murdered 12 people, Rawlins and many of the other suspected gang members were later killed by Guyanese security forces. This massacre was part of a series of murders which appeared to have begun with the murder of a prison officer, Troy Williams, during the Mash Day Prison break on 23 February 2003. == Events == On the morning of Saturday, 26 January 2008, gunmen stormed into the small village of Lusignan, Guyana, and murdered eleven people, including five children and six adults. Five families were affected by the massacre. The gunmen armed with shotguns and AK-47s entered Lusigan around 2:00 am and invaded the homes of five Lusignan families. Within 20 minutes eleven people were murdered. The victims were: Clarence Thomas, 48; Vanessa Thomas, 12; Ron Thomas, 11; Mohandan Goordat, 32; Seegopaul Harilall, 10; Seegobin Harilall, 4; Dhanwajie Ramsingh, 52; Seecharran Rooplall, 56; Raywattie Ramsingh, 11; Shazam Mohammed, 22; and Shaleem Baksh, 52. Several of the murdered children were found dead while still in their beds. Survivors of the attack were Arjune Bhim, 11, Roberto Thomas and Howard Thomas. Both Roberto and Howard, who sustained life-threatening gunshot wounds, have successfully recovered. === Aftermath === As the country experienced nationwide mourning, East Coast residents held protests along the East Coast corridor, where they burned tires and damaged state infrastructure. Residents reported that they had made several attempts to contact the Vigilance Police Station during the siege, but the police did not respond promptly, and arrived at the crime scene long after the gunmen had escaped. Angry residents staged protests to vent their disappointment with the country's fractured national security and were also incensed when government officials visited Lusignan. === Mastermind and motive === The former soldier, Rondell ‚ÄúFineman‚Äù Rawlins, who claimed responsibility for the massacre, was initially wanted for the April 2006 assassination of the Agriculture Minister, Satyadeow Sawh. Rawlins' girlfriend, nineteen-year-old Tenisha Morgan, vanished on 18 January 2008, while on her way to a city hospital to deliver her baby. Rawlins believed that his girlfriend was kidnapped by law enforcement officials in an effort to force Rawlins to turn himself in, although the Joint Services have repeatedly denied this claim. Rawlins telephoned the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) a few days after her disappearance, and warned them to turn over his girlfriend to him or face the consequences. His voice was positively identified by the police. Following the Lusignan Massacre, a man claiming to be Rawlins contacted the local newspaper Kaieteur News by phone. He claimed responsibility for the Lusignan killings, but declared that he was not the mastermind behind the slaying of the Minister for Agriculture in 2006. Rawlins further warned that he would repeat a mass killing in Guyana if his girlfriend was not returned to him alive and well. This threat was realized less than one month after the Lusignan Massacre, with another bloodbath in the mining town of Bartica, during which the town was under siege for approximately one hour. In that incident, thirteen people were murdered, including three policemen, while seven others sustained multiple gunshot wounds. As a result of the Bartica murders the reward for Rawlins was increased, from 5 million dollars to 50 million dollars, as public and international demands for justice increased. === Operation ‚ÄúRestore Order‚Äù === Two days after the Lusignan Massacre, the Joint Services launched Operation Restore Order, headed by the Commissioner of Police, Henry Greene. The operation was launched with the intention of capturing and disabling criminal gangs, and restoring law and order to the country. Sea, land and air resources were mobilized in an effort to capture the killers. On Wednesday, 30 January 2008, members of the Joint Services were engaged in a shoot-out in the vicinity of Pond Dam, Buxton when around ten gunmen shot at, and threw grenades at, the Joint Service ranks. The shootout resulted in the death of two armed men. The two dead were identified as Vibert Leroy Harris (a.k.a. Bolo), of Friendship, East Coast Demerara, and Troy St. John (a.k.a. John Eye). St. John was believed to be Rawlins‚Äô second in command. During Operation Restore Order, the Joint Services cleared a section of the backlands of Buxton to prevent the criminals from escaping into the fields. They discovered the skeletal remains of one man who had been missing since 2007. The Joint Services also recovered several AK-47 rifles, hundreds of rounds of ammunition for various weapons, and military fatigues, among other items, during raids in Buxton. The operation was extended to other towns and villages in Guyana following the second massacre at Bartica. === Condemnation of the attack === The Lusignan massacre was condemned by many factions of the Guyanese community as well as by various international bodies. All the Guyanese political parties and religious bodies unreservedly condemned the Lusignan massacre and called for an end to the brutal crimes. The ruling People's Progressive Party (PPP) issued a statement in which they strongly condemned ‚Äúthe brutal and cold blooded‚Äù murder of the eleven people at Lusignan, and said the attack on the Police Headquarters which preceded the slayings was ‚Äúa well coordinated and centrally directed terrorist attack‚Äù. === Controversy === Various controversies have surrounded the motives of the Lusignan massacre, and the national response to the capture of the criminals. The President of Guyana, Bharrat Jagdeo, refused to hold consultations on the country's crime situation with the main opposition leader, Robert Corbin. The president declared that he would not discuss the matter unless the opposition leader admitted that the community of Buxton was a safe-haven for criminals. The opposition leader said that he would not single out Buxton, as criminals could be found all over the country. Following the second massacre in Bartica, the President did later meet with all national stakeholders, parliamentary political parties and religious bodies on Wednesday, 20 February 2008. As part of Operation Restore Order, the Joint Services conducted various search exercises in the homes of Buxtonians. Many residents complained that their household items were unnecessarily damaged beyond repair. There were also claims of unnecessary force used during the detainment of suspects from the village. The Joint Services subsequently said that all items damaged during the search exercises would be replaced or compensated for. Operation Restore Order saw the clearing of the Buxton backlands, so as to prevent criminals from using the backlands to evade law enforcement. This affected the livelihood of Buxton farmers, as their cash crop farms were cleared. The government of Guyana subsequently set up a compensation scheme in order to assess the claims of destroyed farms and supply monetary compensation for all losses. Tenisha Morgan, who was pregnant at the time of her disappearance, allegedly contacted her mother, Waple Morgan, while still missing. Her mother reportedly said she received a phone call from the young woman, who said she did not know where she was, but she was walking along a dam. She also reportedly said that the baby, a girl, was sick, and that they had no food. A massive search was launched for the missing woman and her baby, but neither were found. Police investigations found inconsistencies in Waple Morgan's report, and that she had changed her story of how she came to receive the phone call. This cast doubt on her reliability but, nonetheless, the police continued to search for the missing pair. ===Rawlins' death=== The search for Rawlins came to an end on 28 August 2008, when police caught up with Rawlins at one of his hideouts near the capital Georgetown. Police shot and killed Rawlins and two other gang members in the shoot-out that followed. ==See also== *List of massacres in Guyana *Rondell Rawlins ==References * News reports and information on the Lusignan Massacre Category:Massacres in Guyana Category:Mass murder in 2008 Category:2008 in Guyana ","title":"Lusignan massacre"},{"id":"20186620","text":"Estadio Alfredo Ramos is a football stadium in Agronom√≠a, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

A Chalcidian helmet or Chalcidian type helmet was a helmet made of bronze and worn by ancient warriors of the Hellenic world, especially popular in Greece in the fifth and fourth centuries BC. The helmet was also worn extensively in the Greek (southern) parts of Italy in the same period. ==Terminology== The helmet is so-called because it was first, and is most commonly, depicted on pottery once thought to derive from the Euboean city of Chalcis. In fact, it is not known whether the helmet originated in Chalcis; indeed, it is not even known whether the pottery in question was Chalcidian. ==Description== A Chaldician helmet made of bronze; second half of the 6th century BC. The helmet appears to have been a development of the Corinthian helmet, its improvements in design giving the wearer better hearing and vision, resulting in a lighter and less bulky helmet. It consisted of a hemispherical dome, and below that, generally inset from the top dome, a pair of cheek pieces and a neck guard, with a substantial loop on either side for the wearer's ears. In the front, between the two cheek pieces, was a small nasal bar to protect the wearer's nose. The helmet could be entirely one piece, or the cheek pieces could be attached separately by hinges, which eased construction and made putting the helmet on easier. In Italy, the helmet with fixed cheek pieces is referred to as Chalcidian, its variant with hinged cheek pieces is called a Lucanian helmet because it was widely used in Lucania. The helmet would commonly have a hole pierced on each cheek piece or elsewhere in order to accept an inner lining which was made of leather. Adornments such as combs and other protuberances were usually placed on the top of the helmet. ==Usage== Chalcidian pottery depicting Heracles fighting the monster Geryon, each of whose three heads is wearing a Chalcidian helmet. Chalcidian type helmet, circa 400 BC, discovered on north of Danube. By the time of Alexander the Great, the helmet was still worn by armoured soldiers, especially Hoplites, the spear-armed heavy infantrymen (other than those of the Spartans, who instead wore the much plainer pilos helmet). It is likely that some of the Macedonian soldiers who ruled the rest of Greece and went on to forge a substantial Hellenistic empire also wore the Chalcidian helmet. The helmet is thought to have developed in turn into the Attic helmet which is iconic of classical soldiers. ==Sources== *Heckel, Waldemar, and Jones, Ryan.

The Sergeant missile system utilized the M143 in its M210 warhead, it could hold 720 individual bomblets. If that system released the bomblets at an altitude of , the weapon could attain a coverage area of 60 square miles. ==Specifications== The M143 was a spherical bomblet that had a diameter of 8.6 centimeters (cm). Designed to carry a liquid biological agent, the M143 carried a 0.5 gram explosive charge meant to disseminate the agent upon impact. Eight percent of the liquid released from the M143 was in the form of an inhalable aerosol. When filled, the bomblet had a mass of .34 kg and 190 milliliters (ml) of liquid agent could contain 6x1012 anthrax spores.Countermeasures, Chapter 6 - An Overview of Emerging Missile State Countermeasures, p. 14, accessed November 12, 2008. The M143 demonstrates the lethality of even a small amount of biological agent, the amount of anthrax contained in the bomblet would be the equivalent of 300 million lethal doses. ==Tests involving the M143== The M143 bomblet was used in multiple biological weapons effectiveness tests by the U.S. Army. Two tests, collectively dubbed \\"Yellow Leaf\\" sought to test the M143 and biological agents in a jungle environment. The tests were divided into two Phases, Phase A was at the Panama Canal Zone and utilized tiara as a simulant. Tests in Panama could not be completed because of \\"international considerations\\", and an alternate test site was found in Hawaii at the Olau Forest, southwest of Hilo. The goals of the Yellow Leaf tests were to learn the effectiveness of the M143 in a jungle environment, the area of coverage for a U.S. Navy MISTEYE I weapons system Sergeant missile biological warhead over a jungle.\\"Fact Sheet - Yellow Leaf \\", Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), Deployment Health Support Directorate, accessed November 12, 2008. The Panama tests took place in February 1964 and the Hawaii tests, utilizing the simulant Bacillus globigii, took place from April-May 1966. Other tests, known as \\"Red Cloud\\", took place from November 1966-February 1967 in the Tanana Valley near Fort Greely, Alaska. The main goal of Red Cloud was to obtain data on Francisella tularensis and its decay rate as well as its animal infectivity data. The tests involved M143 bomblets being dropped from a tower-mounted gun into a wintertime spruce forest. E26 and M32 dissemination devices were also used. The tests disseminated the following biological agents or simulants: F. tularensis (both wet and dry variants), B. globigii, Serratia marcescens, and Escherichia coli. Both Red Cloud and Yellow Leaf were overseen by the U.S. Army's Deseret Test Center,\\"Fact Sheet - Red Cloud \\", Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), Deployment Health Support Directorate, accessed November 12, 2008. and were part of Project 112.\\"Project 112/SHAD Fact Sheets \\", Force Health Protection & Readiness Policy & Programs, The Chemical-Biological Warfare Exposures Site, accessed November 13, 2008. ==See also== *E120 bomblet *M134 bomblet ==References== Category:Biological weapon delivery systems Category:Submunitions ","title":"M143 bomblet"},{"id":"20186742","text":"Uncertainty is a 2008 indie crime drama thriller film written, produced, and directed by U.S. independent filmmakers Scott McGehee and David Siegel and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lynn Collins. It was first released at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. Distribution rights were acquired by IFC Films and it received limited release on November 13, 2009. It was simultaneously made available to cable viewers via video on demand. The film was shot in HD on the Arriflex D-20. == Plot == Bobby (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Kate (Lynn Collins) are a young couple who have been together ten months. Kate is 11 weeks pregnant. They can't make up their minds where to go on the Fourth of July, or whether to have the baby, so they decide to flip a coin. After Bobby flips the coin, they both run off Brooklyn Bridge in opposite directions. From that moment on two separate storylines are followed. One storyline takes place in Brooklyn, where Bobby and Kate decide to go visit Kate's family. On the way they pick up a stray dog, whose owner they try to locate. Kate's family has its share of family drama, with an uncle who is institutionalized and suffers from memory loss, a brother who died five years earlier, and a sister who is taking a year off before going to college, much to her mother's dismay. The other storyline takes place in Manhattan (beginning in Chinatown), where Bobby and Kate find a cellphone belonging to a criminal who values it at $500,000. They try to set up an exchange, but after narrowly escaping pursuit from a killer, Bobby throws the cellphone onto a passing boat. Both storylines end the next day on a bridge, with the lines \\"What do you want to do now? / What do we do now? I don't know. I guess we just keep going\\". The storylines are also set apart by colors of vehicles and Bobby and Kate's clothing. In the Manhattan/Chinatown storyline, they both wear easily recognizable yellow, a dress for her and a T-shirt for him, they took a yellow cab, while in the Brooklyn storyline, they are dressed in more subtle shades of green and Kate is driving her green car. In the first scene on the bridge Kate wears the yellow dress from the Manhattan story, while Bobby wears the outfit he'll wear in Brooklyn. == Cast == * Joseph Gordon- Levitt as Bobby Thompson * Lynn Collins as Kate Montero Brooklyn/Queens * Assumpta Serna as Silvia Montero * Olivia Thirlby as Sophie Montero * Louis Arcella as Diego (Kate's uncle) * Nelson Landrieu as Felix Montero * Manoel Felciano as Greg Montero == Reception == On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 50% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4 out of 10. On Metacritic the film has a score of 45% based on reviews from 9 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".

James published the New England Courant, one of the oldest and the first truly independent American newspapers. ==Early years== James was an older brother of Benjamin Franklin and the son of Josiah Franklin, a chandler and businessman from Ecton, Northamptonshire, England, and Abiah Folger Franklin, who came from a family of Nantucket Puritans. In addition to James, their children included: John (1690-1756), Peter (1692-1766), Mary (1694-ca. 1730), Sarah (1699-1731), Ebenezer (1701-1702), Thomas (1703-1706), Benjamin (1706-1790), Lydia (1708-1758), and Jane (1712-1794). James had seven other siblings from his father's earlier marriage. In 1717, James returned to Boston from England with a Ramage press and a small quantity of type letters to start in the printing trade, and younger brother, Benjamin, became indentured to him. James married Ann Smith, who came from a Puritan family, in 1723, on his 26th birthday. The ceremony, in Boston, was performed by the Rev. John Webb of the New North Church. ==Career== James began publishing the Courant in Boston in 1721 with wife, Ann, and brother, Benjamin, working alongside him. While at the Courant, James gathered a group, referred to by some as \\"The Hell-Fire Club\\", for assistance, and introduced \\"yellow journalism\\" to Boston. The Courant was considered controversial, and James was imprisoned for four weeks in 1722 for writing \\"scandalous libel\\". The paper was suppressed in 1727 and they left Boston in the same year. At the invitation of James's brother, John, a tallow chandler, James and Ann moved to Newport. Here, they had five children, including Mary, Elizabeth, and James Jr. Here, too, James and Ann established the colony's first printing press. Starting in 1727, James printed and published eight editions of the Rhode-Island Almanack, sometimes under the pseudonym \\"Poor Robin\\". They were printed in James' shop near the town schoolhouse, or at his printing-house on Tillinghast's Wharf, near the Union-Flag Tavern. With the assistance of Thomas Fleet, the almanacs were sold as far away as Pudding-Lane in Boston. On September 27, 1732, James published the first issue of the Rhode Island Gazette, by in size. Its run lasted only until May 24, 1733, and its issues were irregular. ==Later years== James was ill while living in Newport, but before his death, his brother Benjamin Franklin came for a visit. When Benjamin left for Philadelphia, he had with him his nephew, James Jr., and provided him with a printing apprenticeship thereafter. After a long illness, James died in Newport in 1735, on his 38th birthday and 12th wedding anniversary. James Franklin was buried in the Newport Common Burying Ground and Island Cemetery. He was survived by Ann, leaving her with four young children to support alone, one child having preceded James in death. Ann Smith Franklin continued to operate the printing business until her death in 1763, publishing under the imprint of \\"The Widow Franklin\\", and producing books, almanacs, pamphlets, and legal announcements. ==Partial bibliography== ;Newspapers * --, & Franklin, B.

He also visited Paris where he met Guillaume Apollinaire and the Cubists including Pablo Picasso, Fernand L√©ger, and Alexander Archipenko. By 1915 he had adopted an abstract style incorporating cubist and futurist elements.Marlborough: Alberto Magnelli Between Cubism and Futurism Over the next few years Magnelli returned to figurative work and drifted away from the Italian avant-garde, which was becoming more supportive of Fascism, which he opposed. By 1931 he had returned to abstraction in the form of concrete art featuring geometric shapes and overlapping planes. He moved to Paris, where he joined the Abstraction- Cr√©ation group and became friends with Wassily Kandinsky, Jean Arp and Sophie Taeuber. Following the invasion of France by the Nazis, Magnelli and his future wife, Susi Gerson, went to live in Grasse with several other artists including the Arps. Some of the group, including Gerson, were Jewish so they were forced to hide. Despite this, the group was able to produce a number of collaborative works.Art In America: An invented paradise Following the Second World War, Magnelli returned to Paris which was to be his home for the rest of his life. He became a major figure in the post war concrete art movement and influenced artists such as Victor Vasarely, Nicolas de Sta√´l as well as the concrete artists in South America such as H√©lio Oiticica.

He was a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and served as a Senator for Victoria from 1962 until his death in 1969. He was also a member of Gough Whitlam's shadow ministry from 1967. He was the first Jew elected to the Senate. ==Early life== Cohen was born on 26 October 1918 in Bankstown, New South Wales, the son of Fanny Dinah (n√©e Fagelman) and Max Lazarus Cohen. His parents were Russian Jews who had arrived in Australia as children. His father worked briefly as a tailor and draper in Griffith, New South Wales, and later as a tyre salesman for Beaurepaires. Cohen and his family moved to Melbourne when he was seven years old. He sung in the choir of the St Kilda synagogue, where he became friends with future governor-general Zelman Cowen. He attended Elwood Central School before winning a scholarship to Wesley College, Melbourne. At the University of Melbourne Cohen won a scholarship to Queen's College, graduating Bachelor of Arts (1940), Bachelor of Laws (1941), and Master of Laws (1942). He was president of the Students' Representative Council and was involved in the National Union of Australian University Students. From 1942 to 1943 Cohen worked on the staff of Alfred Conlon in the Army Land Headquarters Research Section. He then worked with the Universities Commission in Sydney from 1943 to 1945. Cohen was called to the Victorian Bar in 1946. He married solicitor Judith Selig in 1953, with whom he had two daughters. He was appointed Queen's Counsel (QC) in 1961.

Cohen joined the Australian Labor Party (ALP) in 1946, and served as president of its North Kew branch. He was a member of the Labor Left faction and in 1961 he was elected to the Victorian Central Executive, which the faction controlled. He chaired its legal, civil liberties, and law reform committees. ===Senate=== Cohen in 1962 Cohen was elected to the Senate at the 1961 federal election, following a controversial preselection process. His chief opponent was another prominent Jewish barrister Maurice Ashkanasy, who had the support of the Labor Right faction and had opposed the work of the Jewish Council. During the campaign an anonymous pamphlet was circulated to ALP branches labelling Cohen as a fellow traveller. In 1962, Cohen voted against William Haworth's proposal for Australia to raise antisemitism in the Soviet Union at the United Nations. The government used this to expose divisions between Cohen and the anti-Soviet faction of his party, which included Syd Einfeld, the president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. In reply to prominent anti-communist George Hannan, who detailed instances of antisemitism, Cohen stated that Hannan had exaggerated the problem and that Jews largely enjoyed equal rights in the Soviet Union. He accused the government of making a \\"political football out of human suffering\\". Cohen's speech was \\"excoriated in the Australian Jewish Herald\\" and opposed by the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies, weakening relations between the Melbourne Jewish community and the ALP. Cohen was a \\"vigorous opponent\\" of Australian involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1967 he was elected as the deputy to Lionel Murphy, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. He was also elected to Gough Whitlam's shadow ministry, and subsequently appointed by Whitlam as shadow minister for education, science, communications and the arts. He also served on the council of the Australian National University and the executive of the CSIRO. His proposals for a Schools Commission and needs-based Commonwealth grants were later implemented by the Whitlam Government. However, in 1968 Cohen was a member of the ALP Federal Executive that came into conflict with Whitlam, resulting in a leadership spill. ===Death=== Cohen died of a heart attack on 7 October 1969, aged 50. He had been campaigning in Adelaide for the 1969 federal election before collapsing and being taken to The Queen Elizabeth Hospital. He was granted a state funeral and buried at Melbourne General Cemetery. Cohen was posthumously awarded Australian Jew of the Year and the Sam Cohen Memorial Lecture series was established in his honour, the first of which was given by Bob Hawke in 1971. Bill Brown was appointed to replace him in his Senate seat. ==References== Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Australia Category:Jewish Australian politicians Category:Members of the Australian Senate for Victoria Category:Members of the Australian Senate Category:1918 births Category:1969 deaths Category:People educated at Wesley College (Victoria) Category:Melbourne Law School alumni Category:Australian barristers Category:20th-century Australian politicians Category:Australian people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:People who died in office ","title":"Sam Cohen (Australian politician)"},{"id":"20186959","text":"Simon Loueckhote (born 7 May 1957) is a French politician and a former member of the Senate of France, representing the island of New Caledonia.

In 1952 was awarded a Commonwealth Bank Scholarship for six months, to study unionism and working conditions in the UK, Europe and the US. In 1954 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council for Melbourne North, representing the Labor Party. He left the Labor Party in 1955 and would be one of only two non- Catholic parliamentary members of the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist), the other being Robert Joshua, who became the leader of the party in the Australian House of Representatives. Little led the ALP (Anti-Communist) in the Legislative Council from 1955 until 1958, the last two of those years as leader of the Democratic Labor Party, which was the new name for the ALP (Anti-Communist). Little re-contested his Province at the expiry of his term in 1958, but like all other DLP candidates at that election he was defeated. On losing his seat in 1958 he purchased a newsagency in Reservoir, Victoria, which he ran until his election to the Australian Senate in 1968. Little successfully contested DLP preselection for the Senate in 1958, in which he defeated the original leader of the ALP (Anti-Communist) Les Coleman. It has been argued that Little was preferred as a DLP candidate because he was not a Catholic.Ainsley Symons (2012), \\"Democratic Labor Party members in the Victorian Parliament of 1955-1958\\", Recorder (Australian Society for the Study of Labour History, Melbourne Branch, No. 275, November, pp. 4-5.

They form mycorrhizae with various tree species, mostly from the family Pinaceae. Species are present over much of the world's temperate and boreal forest habitats. It is well documented that species from this genera are an important part of the diet of the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus). Also, some Australian marsupials, especially the rat-kangaroos, feed extensively on these fungi. The fungi also benefit from this relationship: not only do the squirrels help to disperse the spores and propagate the species, studies suggest that passage through the digestive tract of a mammal promotes germination of spores. ==Taxonomy== The genus was first described by Italian doctor and naturalist Carlo Vittadini in 1831. for hypogeous (below-ground) gasteromycetes with chambers exposed to the surface and lined with a spore- bearing hymenium, a basal rhizomorph, and ovoid-fusiform, striate-grooved spores. Vittadini's original concept was based on two species he collected in Italy, Gauteria morchellaeformis and Gautieria graveolens. In 1918, Zeller and Dodge examined various dried herbarium collections of Gautieria, and recognized five species. Additional research led to them recognizing 34 species and expanding their generic concept to include species with a well- developed peridium of periclinal hyphae at maturity. As of 2008, Gautieria is thought to contain 25 species. ==Description== Fruit bodies (gasterocarps) are typically roughly spherical in shape, with a persisting single or branched rhizomorph. The columella (the central sterile portion of the sporangium) are variable in size and shape. The peridium (the wall of the sporangium) is thin and short-lasting. The gleba is initially white, but later becomes colored by the masses of spores. The basidia are club-shaped, usually two-spored, and with long filiform sterigmata. Spores are 12‚Äì26 ¬µm long, and ovoid to ellipsoid in shape. ==Species== *Gautieria caudata (Harkn.)

He later represented Wiltshire in the Minor Counties and played List A cricket for both Wiltshire and for Minor Counties representative sides. Born at Bloemhof in Transvaal on 29 April 1937, Barwell was a right-handed middle- order batsman and an occasional wicketkeeper. Towards the end of his first- class career, when he played for Somerset's second eleven, he also bowled with some success. Barwell played first for Somerset in 1959 in a match against the Combined Services, keeping wicket and making the only stumping of his first- class career. Unable to play County Championship cricket until 1961 as he qualified for the county by residence, his appearances were in any case restricted in some seasons by his career as a schoolmaster. But even in those seasons when he was more regularly available, he often found himself a fringe first-team player, never making more than 11 first-class appearances in any one season and managing a highest season aggregate of just 410 runs, which he achieved in 1967. His best score was an unbeaten and quick 84 against Glamorgan at Weston-super-Mare in 1965. He also made 74 not out against the Pakistanis in 1967, though he was much upstaged by a second wicket partnership of 262 between Roy Virgin and Mervyn Kitchen, who made 162 and 189 respectively. He appeared in Somerset's losing Gillette Cup side of 1967, being run out for 24 in what Wisden termed \\"a fearful mix-up\\" with Graham Burgess. After starting the 1968 season as a regular member of the side, he dropped out after a few games and did not regain his place. In second eleven cricket, Barwell was a reliable and prolific scorer, acting as batsman, occasional wicketkeeper, sometime captain and, more rarely, bowler. His final match for the combined Gloucestershire and Somerset Second Eleven side in 1968 saw him make 45 out of 54 added while he was at the wicket in a first innings that totalled only 78, top-score in the second innings with 68 and then take four wickets for 14 runs as the combined side recovered to force a draw with Kent's second eleven. After leaving Somerset, he played for Wiltshire, appearing in first-round Gillette Cup matches against Hampshire in both 1972 and 1973, and also turning out for the Minor Counties representative side in the Benson and Hedges Cup. In 1973, he made a single final first-class cricket appearance for the Minor Counties side against the West Indies at Torquay. As a schoolmaster, he taught at Dr Morgan's School, Bridgwater, Marlborough College and at Blundell's School. ==External links== * * Terry Barwell at CricketArchive ==References== Category:English cricketers Category:Somerset cricketers Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Wiltshire cricketers Category:Minor Counties cricketers ","title":"Terry Barwell"},{"id":"20187246","text":"The Finnish national under-19 football team is the national under-19 football team of Finland. ==UEFA European Under-19 Championship== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !Year !Round -  2002Did not qualify -  2003Did not qualify -  2004Did not qualify -  2005Did not qualify -  2006Did not qualify -  2007Did not qualify -  2008Did not qualify -  2009Did not qualify -  2010Did not qualify -  2011Did not qualify -  2012Did not qualify -  2013Did not qualify -  2014Did not qualify -  2015Did not qualify -  2016Did not qualify -  2017Did not qualify -  2018Group stage -  2019Did not qualify } ==Competitive recordUEFA European Youth Tournament=== * 1975 runners-up ==Current squad== Selections for the 2020 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualification matches against on 13 November 2019, on 16 November 2019 and on 19 November 2019.U19-pojat nimetty EM-karsintaturnaukseen Tanskaan ----- ! colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#B0D3FB\\" align=\\"left\\"  ----- ! colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#B0D3FB\\" align=\\"left\\"  ----- ! colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#B0D3FB\\" align=\\"left\\"  ===Recent callups=== The following players have also been called up to the Finland under-19 squad the last twelve months and remain eligible: ----- ! colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#B0D3FB\\" align=\\"left\\"  ----- ! colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#B0D3FB\\" align=\\"left\\"  ----- ! colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#B0D3FB\\" align=\\"left\\"  ----- ! colspan=\\"9\\" bgcolor=\\"#B0D3FB\\" align=\\"left\\"  ==Coaching staff== U19 (2001) maajoukkue * Head coach: Kai Nyyss√∂nen * Coach: Juho Rantala * Goalkeeping Coach: Jani Meril√§inen * Video Analyst: Kalle Marjam√§ki * Doctor: Ilari Kuitunen * Physiotherapist: Niklas Virtanen * Kit Manager: Sami Miettinen * Team Manager: Ville Sairanen ==See also== * Finland national football team * Finland national under-21 football team * Finland national under-17 football team ==References== Category:European national under-19 association football teams Category:Finland national football team ","title":"Finland national under-19 football team"},{"id":"20187253","text":"William Walter Charles Brown (4 December 1920 ‚Äì 26 June 2001) The Biographical Dictionary of the Australian Senate: 1962-1983 - Volume 3 was an Australian politician who served as a Senator for Victoria from 1969 to 1970 and 1971 to 1978, representing the Labor Party.

Starlight Park stands on the site of an amusement park of the same name that operated in the first half of the 20th century. The amusement park was originally built for the Bronx International Exposition of Science, Arts and Industries, which was hosted in 1918, and as such the park was known as Exposition Park during that time. During its heyday, Starlight Park featured various amusement rides, as well as the Bronx Coliseum and the submarine . Much of the park was destroyed in a 1932 fire, though the remaining attractions continued to operate until 1946. The northeastern part of the amusement park became the West Farms Depot of MTA Regional Bus Operations. A city park, operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, was built in the late 1950s as part of the construction of the Sheridan Expressway. The highway was built parallel to the Bronx River on the former site of the amusement park. ==History Amusement park ===  Early years  The site had originally contained the estate of politician William Waldorf Astor. Exposition Park was initially leased in 1914 as part of the plans for the Bronx International Exposition of Science, Arts and Industries, which opened in 1918. The exposition, intended to showcase the recent creation of Bronx County, was so unsuccessful that it only attracted one country, Brazil. The park was renamed Starlight Park on October 18, 1919, shortly after the exposition's close. The Bronx Expositions Corporation purchased numerous rides and attractions, and converted the \\"exhibition hall\\" to an ice rink and dance hall. The rebranded Starlight Park opened in 1920. Throughout that year Starlight Park's operators added several attractions and concessions, including shooting galleries, games of chance, and a dark ride through an exhibit of \\"grottos and other worldly sights\\". The park continued to add attractions and events for the 1921 season, including a baseball field, several shows, and a kid's club. Further additions in 1922 included a sound system by the pool area; a program of movies broadcast from a projector; and rides such as electric riding cars, the Gyroplane, and the Maelstrom. Numerous promotional events were also held that year, including a Film Players Club fundraiser, a singing contest, and a \\"Surprise Week\\" featuring a different performance each day of the week.  Lawsuit and incidents  In December 1920 the Bronx Expositions Corporation was the subject of a breach of contract lawsuit filed by Exposition Catering, which at the time was one of the largest lawsuits filed in the entertainment industry. According to the lawsuit, the Expositions Corporation had failed to uphold a contract to build an elaborate entrance, a convention center, and a permanent exposition, and had instead erected \\"a cheap amusement park\\" because of their mismanagement of money. The outcome of the lawsuit was unknown. During this time, several other lawsuits were filed against the park because of numerous incidents which resulted in injuries. In 1922, there were two accidents that damaged the park's reputation. On May 21, a rider decided to stand up on the roller coaster as it rounded a curve, fell off, and was killed. The operator applied the emergency brake, injuring six other riders. That November, Starlight Park's large Exposition Hall was destroyed in a fire, and the park's Ferris wheel and scenic railway were also badly damaged. Two smaller dance halls replaced the Exposition Hall. Furthermore, the park in general was susceptible to fire because most of the buildings were flammable wooden structures. A thunderstorm on June 23, 1922, burned down several structures. There were several other incidents that brought negative attention to Starlight Park. For instance, throughout the park's operation, there were numerous drownings in the pool area. Additionally, over two hundred bathers' items were stolen during a mass robbery in 1925. The following year, a boxer died in a match at Starlight Park. A circus performer died in 1930 after falling from a high wire.  Later years and closure  The park was at its largest in 1926 when it had 150 concessions and 26 rides. The following year saw the installation of the Forest Inn, a combined restaurant/performance venue. Many of the original attractions still remained, including the Bug House, Nonsense House, the Whip, a Noah's Ark, a Skee-Ball game, the wooden coaster, the Ferris wheel, the Frolic, the Motor Dome, the Whirlpool, Witching Waves, and the Canals of Venice. In 1929, the 15,000-seat Bronx Coliseum opened at Starlight Park, becoming the park's new sporting arena. With the start of the Great Depression in 1929, Starlight Park's operators installed several rides, as well as launched promotions such as free-admission days and contests, in an attempt to increase its visitor count. The park increased its schedule of events, as they were seen as more efficient than adding new rides. On August 8, 1932, a large section of Starlight Park was destroyed in a fire that started under the now- abandoned roller coaster and spread to numerous concessions. Fifteen thousand guests saw the fire, which was said to be started by several young boys. In the aftermath of the fire, the Coliseum was the largest remaining attraction and continued to keep the park profitable. Several political rallies, including those of the Communist Party USA, were held at the Coliseum. However, Starlight Park also continued to make a profit from the swimming pool, picnic areas, and sporting fields. Furthermore, in 1933, Starlight Park's manager added several recreational facilities in order to keep the park solvent. By this time, it was no longer envisioned as an amusement park. By 1940, Starlight Park was bankrupt, and a portion of the park and Coliseum were sold at auction. The new owner, Richard F. Mount, leased the structures to a syndicate in May 1941, which in turn proposed building new sporting fields on the site. However, these plans were abridged by World War II and the United States Army took over the Coliseum between 1942 and 1946. The stucco and wood bathing pavilion was damaged in a fire in July 1946 and was totally destroyed by another blaze the next year. The park site was condemned, and the Coliseum became the West Farms bus depot, operated by MTA Regional Bus Operations. ===Conversion to city park=== Boat dock on reopening day A city park, operated by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, was built in the late 1950s as part of the construction of the Sheridan Expressway. The highway was built parallel to the Bronx River on the former site of Starlight Park, which had been condemned to provide the right-of-way for both the Sheridan and Cross Bronx Expressways. As part of the project, a city park with the same name was created in its place, east of the expressway. The city park comprised land west and south of the original site of the amusement park, along both banks of the river. In the 1990s, after Youth Ministries had made the state aware of pollution on the Bronx River, the New York state government started to clean up the river. Cleanup efforts were delayed when chemicals from an old gas plant at the site were discovered in 2003. As part of the plan to clean up the pollution, the New York State Department of Transportation agreed to rebuild the park and connect it to the Bronx River Greenway, a proposed waterfront path along the Bronx River. In 2013, after a 10-year renovation that cost $18 million, NYC Parks reopened a section of the public park. Another segment remained closed because of a disagreement with Amtrak, who owned the Northeast Corridor railroad tracks on the park's eastern edge. A $13 million environmentally-friendly headquarters for the Bronx River Alliance, described in The New York Times as \\"the greenest building in the South Bronx\\", opened within the park in 2016. In 2017, an expansion of the new Starlight Park was announced. As part of this expansion, parts of the park would undergo environmental cleanups. The Phase 2 project would also connect Starlight Park to Concrete Plant Park south of Westchester Avenue via new bridges across the Bronx River and the Northeast Corridor. This coincided with another plan to downgrade Sheridan Expressway to a street-level boulevard so that the surrounding community could more easily access Starlight Park. At the time, the park was only accessible via the East 174th Street bridge that crosses both the expressway and the Bronx River. The project was undertaken to improve pedestrian safety and increase access to both Starlight Park and the Bronx River shoreline. The project to downgrade the Sheridan Expressway began in late 2018 and was completed in December 2019. == Current attractions == Current recreational facilities in Starlight Park include four baseball fields (two made of grass and two of asphalt), as well as five checkers tables and eight handball courts. A soccer field overlaps with two of the baseball fields, and a basketball court and playground are located south of the 174th Street bridge over the park. A seasonal canoe launch is located in the park as well. Plans for the park, announced in 2017, call for a waterfront greenway, as well as the opening of the parkland on the eastern bank of the Bronx River. ==Former attractions Rides === Starlight Park amusement park featured fireworks displays, a roller coaster, a swimming pool, and carnival games of skill and chance. The initial attractions were built for the Bronx International Exposition. The swimming pool was marketed as the world's largest saltwater pool, measuring with a capacity of , and ranging from deep. The pool contained diving boards and a wave pool machine at the deep end, as well as a beach with sand brought from Rockaway, Queens. The fair also contained a scenic ridable miniature railway on the Bronx River, a \\"mountain\\" exhibit with a waterfall, and a hotel nearby. LaMarcus Adna Thompson built a wooden roller coaster at the site, which featured a dual track. The Eli Bridge Company's Ferris wheel from the Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition was brought over to the Bronx World's Fair. Other attractions included a bathing pavilion that could fit 4,500 people; a convention center; and 15 large pavilions, including Chinese and North Sea-themed pavilions, as well as those for fine arts, liberal arts, and American achievements. At the end of the 1918 Exposition, the \\"exhibition hall\\" became an ice rink and dance hall. When the Exposition Hall was burned down in 1922, it was replaced with two smaller dance halls. By 1927, the park had installed Witching Waves, an undulating flat ride. A Tilt- A-Whirl, a scooter ride, a new Noah's Ark and a \\"Snap o' the Whip\\" ride were added in 1929 to draw patrons. Additions in 1931 included a miniature golf course on the site of Witching Waves, as well as a roller rink. === Other attractions === The , exhibited at Starlight Park from 1918 to 1932 One of the park's most popular attractions was the submarine . After being constructed by Irish-American inventor John Philip Holland in 1888, the Holland became the first submarine commissioned by the United States Navy. She had been maintained by the navy at Norfolk, Virginia, for training purposes until 1914, when she became a museum ship in Philadelphia and Atlantic City, New Jersey. The submarine then moved to Starlight Park in 1918 and remained there until 1932, when she was disassembled for scrap as part of the entire park's demolition. The 15,000-seat Bronx Coliseum was also located in Starlight Park, and was opened in 1929. It was the home field of the New York Giants soccer team, but also featured numerous other sporting events as well as circuses. The Coliseum also held events when Madison Square Garden in Manhattan was already hosting another event. The stadium was originally built for the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and was transported to 177th Street and Devoe Avenue in 1928. It came to be called the New York Coliseum, which had no relation to the building with the same name that was later built at Columbus Circle in Manhattan. === Other structures === The amusement park was also home of the studios of radio station WBNX, which started broadcasting in 1926 and was known as \\"the official broadcasting station of the New York Coliseum\\". It was located at Starlight Park until 1932, when the park's partial closure forced the station to relocate. == Events == The first summer music festival in Starlight Park was hosted in 1921 when the Russian Symphony Orchestra Society performed Wagner at the park. Starting in 1926, the park offered free 14-week-long programs of opera music in the summer, in an attempt to give the masses access to high culture at no cost. The first of these operas, Rigoletto, was performed in May 1926. The shows were given in the open air until the Starlight Park Stadium was erected, after which performances were moved to the stadium. On Saturday nights, big- band jazz played for dancers on an outdoor dance floor, giving the park a feeling of \\"blue collar country club\\". Semiprofessional sports teams would compete at Starlight Park's baseball field, added in 1921. Events such as baseball and soccer games, boxing matches, horseshoe throwing, and track and field competitions also drew crowds to Starlight Park. One such match in October 1926 resulted in the death of boxer Joseph Geraghty; his opponent was later cleared of any wrongdoing. After the Coliseum opened in 1929, these events were moved to the stadium. Children were also able to join a club called the Kiddie Klub, which entitled the member to several designated free- admission days at numerous amusement parks in New York City. Prospective members had to clip three coupons from different newspapers in exchange for a membership pin. The first Kiddie Klub day on July 13, 1921, saw over 20,000 children. The following year, there was a miscommunication about the Kiddie Klub event. On July 12, 1922, the Kiddie Klub free day had been held at Coney Island's Luna Park, but about 50 children showed up at Starlight Park instead. The actual Kiddie Klub day at Starlight Park was held two weeks later. Vaudeville acts and high diving performances were other popular events hosted in Starlight Park. Toward the late 1920s, in the park's attempt to bring back patrons, more tawdry shows began performing at Starlight Park. == See also == *History of the Bronx * List of amusement parks * List of New York City parks == References == * ==External links== * * Category:1918 establishments in New York (state) Category:1932 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:Defunct amusement parks in New York (state) Category:Defunct amusement parks in the United States Category:Event venues established in 1918 Category:Parks in the Bronx Category:World's fair sites in New York (state) Category:West Farms, Bronx ","title":"Starlight Park"}]`),R={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:12,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=12}}},D={class:"card-container"};function I(s,a,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâyour wikiü•≥")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",D,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(R,[["render",I]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/1.md","filePath":"quotes/1.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/1.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(a,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{x as __pageData,G as default};
