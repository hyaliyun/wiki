The player controls a party of three adventurers in turn-based battles against small groups of opponents. Battles are selected from an overhead map. As there is no manoeuvering, tactics are limited to selecting which opponent to attack with which character; players can also conduct combo attacks or use items. The cartoonish characters and enemies, which include zombie sheep, are assigned one of four classes, whose capabilities relate to each other according to a rock-paper-scissors mechanic: sages (green) beat rogues (red), who beat warriors (blue), who beat mages (purple), who in turn beat sages. Successful battles are rewarded with gold, which is used to buy equipment or skills for the characters; gold can also be purchased for real money. By the end of March 2012, the game held a Metacritic score of 79 out of 100, indicating \\"generally favorable\\" reviews.

It is situated on Tansen Marg, between Mandi House roundabout and Bengali Market. ==History== The idea of starting a dance institution in Delhi was raised by Sundari K. Shridharani, a former student of dancer Uday Shankar, in 1950 when she had just moved to Delhi after marriage. The name 'Triveni Kala Sangam' was coined by flautist, Vijay Raghav Rao and literally meaning \\"confluence of arts\\". It started in one room above a Coffee House in Connaught Place, Delhi, with two students under noted artist K. S. Kulkarni. Soon her efforts got noticed, and Pandit Nehru allotted her the land for the institution. Gradually, she organized a small group of people, started organizing concerts, and collecting funds. Guru Rajkumar Singhajit Singh joined Triveni in 1954, as Head of the Manipur Dance Section, and later in 1962, founded the ‘Triveni Ballet’ of which he was Director and Principal Dancer.DR. R.K.

DDoS attacks are a constant threat to businesses and organizations by threatening service performance or to shut down a website entirely, even for a short time. The first thing to do in DDoS mitigation is to identify normal conditions for network traffic by defining \\"traffic patterns\\", which is necessary for threat detection and alerting. DDoS mitigation also requires identifying incoming traffic to separate human traffic from human-like bots and hijacked web browsers. The process is done by comparing signatures and examining different attributes of the traffic, including IP addresses, cookie variations, HTTP headers, and JavaScript footprints. After the detection is made, the next process is filtering. Filtering can be done through anti-DDoS technology like connection tracking, IP reputation lists, deep packet inspection, blacklisting/whitelisting, or rate limiting. One technique is to pass network traffic addressed to a potential target network through high-capacity networks with \\"traffic scrubbing\\" filters. Manual DDoS mitigation is no longer recommended due to DDoS attackers being able to circumvent DDoS mitigation software that is activated manually. Other ways to prevent DDoS attacks can be implemented on-premise or/and via cloud-based solution providers. Through on- premise mitigation the technology (most commonly a hardware device) is placed in front of the network, with the disadvantage that the filtering capacity is limited to the capacity of the filtering device. A middle option is to have a hybrid solution by combining on-premise filtering with cloud-base filtering. Best practices for DDoS mitigation include having both anti-DDoS technology and anti-DDoS emergency response services. DDoS mitigation is also available through cloud-based providers. ==Methods of attack== DDoS attacks are executed against websites and networks of selected victims. A number of vendors are offering \\"DDoS resistant\\" hosting services, mostly based on techniques similar to content delivery networks. Distribution avoids single point of congestion and prevents the DDoS attack from concentrating on a single target. One technique of DDoS attacks is to use misconfigured third-party networks that allow amplification of spoofed UDP packets. Proper configuration of network equipment, enabling ingress filtering and egress filtering, as documented in BCP 38 and RFC 6959, prevents amplification and spoofing, thus reducing the number of relay networks available to attackers. ==See also== * Internet security * Web threat * Vulnerability (computing) * DDoS ==References== Category:Computer network security Category:System administration * Category:Cyberwarfare ","title":"DDoS mitigation"},{"id":"35283935","text":"Crystal Mall Rajkot Logo Crystal Mall is a shopping mall located in Rajkot in Gujarat State of India.

Though officially affiliated with the Pro Wrestling Freedoms promotion, Gentaro also works for several other independent promotions, including DDT Pro-Wrestling, Kaientai Dojo and women's wrestling promotion Ice Ribbon, where he works mainly as the lead play-by-play announcer. Takahashi also makes sporadic appearances as the masked character Benten (also stylized in all capital letters). ==Professional wrestling career== Trained by the Wrestle Dream Factory (WDF) promotion, Takahashi made his professional wrestling debut on May 8, 1999, at a WDF event in Tokorozawa, Saitama. While also making appearances for Kageki Pro as the masked character Nasty Black Panther, Takahashi remained with WDF for two years, before becoming a freelancer in 2001. Dramatic Dream Team / DDT Pro-Wrestling (2000–2012, 2014) On November 30, 2000, Gentaro made his debut for Dramatic Dream Team (DDT), teaming with Takashi Sasaki in a tag team match, where they defeated Kengo Takai and Yuki Nishino. Gentaro began working regularly for the promotion in October 2001, when he started a storyline rivalry with Mikami. On November 1, Gentaro won his first title in DDT, when he and Yoshiya defeated Mikami and Tanomusaku Toba to win the vacant KO-D Tag Team Championship. Gentaro and Yoshiya made their first successful defense on November 30, defeating Mikami and Toba in a rematch, with Gentaro pinning his rival for the win. However, on December 12, Mikami came back and pinned Gentaro to make himself and Gentaro's former partner Takashi Sasaki the new KO-D Tag Team Champions. On June 6, 2002, Gentaro received his first shot at DDT's top singles title, the KO-D Openweight Championship, when he unsuccessfully challenged Kintaro Kanemura. In July, Gentaro reunited with Takashi Sasaki, under the team name Akarangers, to take part in the 2002 KO-D Tag League, where they would finish third. On October 24, the Akarangers defeated Mikami and Tanomusaku Toba Championship vs. Championship match to retain the WEW World Tag Team Championship and win the KO-D Tag Team Championship. On November 14, Gentaro defeated Sasaki and Tomohiko Hashimoto in a three-way match to become the number one contender to the KO-D Openweight Championship. On November 29, Gentaro defeated Sanshiro Takagi to also become the new KO-D Openweight Champion. However, his reign would last less than a month, as he was defeated by rival Mikami on December 22, in a four-way match, which also included Sanshiro Takagi and Tomohiko Hashimoto. On January 4, 2003, Gentaro made his first appearance as the kabuki mask wearing Benten, taking part in a battle royal for the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship. Benten has since also made appearances for Kaientai Dojo, Apache Pro-Wrestling Army, New Japan Pro Wrestling, and Union Pro Wrestling. On January 31, 2003, Gentaro and Sasaki lost the KO-D Tag Team Championship to Sanshiro Takagi and Tomohiko Hashimoto. Shortly afterwards, Gentaro left DDT for the remainder of the year, returning in early 2004, when he reunited with Sasaki, with the two defeating Hero! and Kudo on February 11 to regain the KO-D Tag Team Championship. After three successful defenses, they lost the title to Ryuji Ito and Sanshiro Takagi on July 1. On September 30, Gentaro won the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship two times during a ten-minute battle royal, but was unable to leave the match with the title. From October 2004 to December 2009, Gentaro only made fifteen appearances for DDT, but still managed to win the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship for the third time on April 9, 2008, and losing it two days later. Gentaro finally returned full-time on January 10, 2010, when he defeated longtime rival Mikami for the DDT Extreme Division Championship. After a four-month reign, he lost the title to Danshoku Dino on May 5. In October 2010, Gentaro formed a new stable named Granma with Dick Togo and Yasu Urano. After Gentaro and Urano unsuccessfully challenged Antonio Honda and Daisuke Sasaki for the KO-D Tag Team Championship on November 28, Gentaro also faced Honda in a losing effort for the interim KO-D Openweight Championship on December 26. On February 20, 2011, Gentaro and Urano defeated Honda and Sasaki in a rematch to win the KO-D Tag Team Championship, Gentaro's third time winning the title. On March 27, Gentaro entered the annual Anytime and Anywhere battle royal, a match combining elements of a regular battle royal and a ladder match, where he managed to grab the \\"Right to Challenge Anytime, Anywhere\\" contract to earn the right to challenge for the KO-D Openweight Championship at a time of his own choosing. After three successful title defenses, Gentaro and Urano lost the KO-D Tag Team Championship to Munenori Sawa and Shigehiro Irie on June 4. On June 19, Gentaro cashed in his \\"Right to Challenge Anytime, Anywhere\\" contract, but was defeated in his KO-D Openweight Championship match by the defending champion, Shuji Ishikawa. Granma folded shortly afterwards, following the retirement of Dick Togo on June 30, and Gentaro and Urano failing to recapture the KO-D Tag Team Championship on July 24. Gentaro returned to DDT on June 3, 2012, when Tomomitsu Matsunaga chose him as his tag team partner, after earning the right to challenge for the KO-D Tag Team Championship. In their title match, Gentaro and Matsunaga were defeated by the defending champions, Yasu Urano and Yuji Hino. On July 30, Gentaro returned to referee a four-way tag team match, after which he surprised one of the competitors, Mio Shirai, and pinned her to become the new Ironman Heavymetalweight Champion. However, his reign ended later that same event, when he was pinned by Michael Mamezawa. Gentaro returned to DDT on July 20, 2014, when he teamed with Yasu Urano in a tag team match, where they faced Mikami and Tomomitsu Matsunaga. After submitting Mikami for the win, Gentaro entered a storyline, where he took his \\"unmotivated\\" opponent under his wing to help him out of his recent slump. This led to a match on August 17 at DDT's biggest event of the year, Ryogoku Peter Pan 2014, where Gentaro and Mikami defeated Akito and Yasu Urano. WEW and Apache Pro-Wrestling Army (2002–2009) In 2002, Gentaro began working for the newly founded World Entertainment Wrestling (WEW), teaming with Takashi Sasaki on August 23 to defeat Hi68 and Taka Michinoku and become the first WEW-promoted World Tag Team Champions. After a seven-month reign, Gentaro and Sasaki lost the title to Kintaro Kanemura and Tetsuhiro Kuroda on March 11, 2003. The following year, WEW folded and was replaced by Apache Pro- Wrestling Army, with Gentaro jumping to the new promotion, where he would join the Apache Army. As a member of the Apache Army, Gentaro formed a regular partnership with The Winger and adopted a new character, opposing all hardcore wrestling. On September 23, 2007, Gentaro and The Winger defeated Jun Kasai and Jaki Numazawa to win the WEW World Tag Team Championship, starting Gentaro's second reign with the title. They would lose the title to Tokyo Gurentai (Mazada and Nosawa Rongai) on April 17, 2008. The following year, Apache Pro-Wrestling Army folded. Kaientai Dojo (2003–present) On August 16, 2003, Gentaro made his debut for Kaientai Dojo, teaming with Hi69 to defeat Kengo Mashimo and Kunio Toshima in a tag team match. During the following months, Gentaro formed a regular trio with Hi69 and Kazma. In December 2003, Gentaro, Daigoro Kashiwa, Hi69, Kazma, Psycho and Teppei Ishizaka made it to the finals of the Survivor-K tournament, before being defeated by Kengo Mashimo, Kunio Toshima, Mike Lee Jr., Miyawaki, Super-X and Yuu Yamagata. On July 3, 2004, Gentaro won his first championship in Kaientai Dojo, when he teamed with Yoshiya to defeat Daigoro Kashiwa and Teppei Ishizaka for the UWA/UWF Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. After a four- month reign, Gentaro and Yoshiya lost the title to Taka Michinoku and Ryota Chikuzen on October 30. Gentaro became a champion again on February 12, 2005, when he defeated Onryo for the UWA World Middleweight Championship. However, his reign ended just seven days later, when he was defeated by Boso Boy Raito. Afterwards, Gentaro took a four-month break from Kaientai Dojo to concentrate on his work in Apache Pro-Wrestling Army, defeating Psycho in his return match on June 11. The following month, he entered the Strongest-K tournament, defeating female wrestler Tomoka Nakagawa and Kunio Toshima to advance to the semifinals of the tournament, where, on August 6, he was defeated by Psycho. During the next four years, Gentaro only made three more appearances for Kaientai Dojo. After the folding of Apache Pro-Wrestling Army, Gentaro returned to Kaientai Dojo on May 5, 2009, reuniting with Yoshiya. On August 9, Gentaro and Yoshiya unsuccessfully challenged Makoto Oishi and Shiori Asahi for the Strongest-K Tag Team Championship. On September 23, Gentaro defeated Oishi to win the Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship. Afterwards, Gentaro began spending more time in his new home promotion, Freedoms, but returned on April 2, 2010, to lose the Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship to Marines Mask II. Gentaro's next Kaientai Dojo appearance took place on December 16, 2011, when he wrestled in Kengo Mashimo's tenth anniversary match, where Mashimo, Hiroki and Yasu Urano defeated Gentaro, Taka Michinoku and Yoshiya. On January 9, 2012, Gentaro and Hiroki entered the Kaientai Dojo Tag League, where they made it to the finals, before losing to Kengo Mashimo and Taka Michinoku on January 28. On February 4, Gentaro and Hiroki defeated Mashimo and Ryuichi Sekine in a tag team match, with Gentaro pinning Mashimo for the win. As a result, Gentaro was named the number one contender to Mashimo's Strongest-K Championship, but was defeated in the title match on February 26. Gentaro returned to Kaientai Dojo on July 17, 2014, unsuccessfully challenging Taka Michinoku for the Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship. Ice Ribbon (2008–present) Gentaro in September 2010 On July 14, 2008, Gentaro made his debut for women's wrestling promotion Ice Ribbon, teaming with Riho to defeat Emi Sakura and Ribbon Takanashi in a tag team match. Gentaro returned to Ice Ribbon seventeen months later on December 20, 2009, when he began working regularly for the promotion, becoming only the second male wrestler to have a regular spot on the roster (the first being Ribbon Takanashi). In March 2010, Gentaro got involved in a storyline with Miyako Matsumoto, starting on March 31, when he successfully defended the DDT Extreme Division Championship against her. Following the match, Gentaro and Matsumoto formed a tag team, wrestling Keita Yano and Munenori Sawa to a fifteen-minute time limit draw on April 7. However, problems quickly arose between the two, when Matsumoto revealed that Gentaro's fellow Freedoms worker Jun Kasai was her favorite wrestler. On April 17, when Matsumoto and Kasai were named the number one contenders to the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship, held by Kazumi Shimouna and Nanae Takahashi of Passion Red, Gentaro interrupted the announcement and demanded to be included in the match. When Emi Sakura agreed to change the match, Keita Yano entered the ring and attacked Matsumoto, revealing himself as Gentaro's partner. The three-way match, contested under hardcore rules, took place on May 3, and saw Matsumoto and Kasai become the new champions. On August 11, Gentaro formed a new tag team with Mai Ichii, with the two defeating the reigning International Ribbon Tag Team Champions, Chii Tomiya and Isami Kodaka, in a non-title match in their first match together. As a result, Gentaro and Ichii were granted a shot at the title on September 23, where they defeated Tomiya and Kodaka to become the new International Ribbon Tag Team Champions. However, Gentaro's and Ichii's reign ended just two days later, when they were defeated by Emi Sakura and Nanae Takahashi. Since losing the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship, Gentaro has mainly remained outside of storylines, wrestling only sporadically, and instead began working as the lead play-by-play announcer on Ice Ribbon's broadcasts on Ustream and Samurai TV. Freedoms (2009–present) After the folding of Apache Pro-Wrestling Army, Gentaro officially made Pro Wrestling Freedoms his new home promotion, debuting at the promotion's first ever event on September 2, defeating the promotion's founder and former partner Takashi Sasaki in the opening match. Later in the main event, Gentaro teamed with The Winger in a losing effort against the team of Taka Michinoku and Tajiri. At the promotion's second event on September 27, Gentaro defeated El Samurai in the main event to retain the International Junior Heavyweight and VKF Championships. During the rest of the year, Gentaro also successfully defended the titles against Madoka and just the International Junior Heavyweight Championship against Kazuhiko Ogasawara. In November, Gentaro was invited to represent Freedoms in New Japan Pro Wrestling's 2009 Super J-Cup. He was eliminated from the tournament in the first round on December 22 by Ryusuke Taguchi. In early 2010, Gentaro continued defending both titles, while also regularly teaming with The Winger, with the two joining the Freedoms Army in the process. Freedoms Army feuded with the Big Japan Pro Wrestling based Kojika Army, culminating on June 21, 2010, in a special event, where members of both stables faced each other in singles matches. In the main event of the evening, Gentaro defeated Kojika Army leader, The Great Kojika, in a singles match, winning the match series for Freedoms Army 3–2. At the following event on July 15, Gentaro turned on the Freedoms Army and jumped to the Kojika Army. The turn built to a four-on- four elimination match between the two stables on November 23, which Takashi Sasaki won for Freedoms by pinning Gentaro. On December 15, Gentaro was defeated by Sasaki in a Two Out of Three Falls main event, ending the rivalry between the two wrestlers. In 2011, the Kojika Army moved on to feuding with the DDT Pro-Wrestling based TKG48 stable, led by Sanshiro Takagi. On March 6, Gentaro teamed with The Great Kojika to defeat Takagi and Riki Sensyu in a tag team match, pinning Takagi for the win. On March 26, Gentaro unsuccessfully challenged Jun Kasai for American promotion Combat Zone Wrestling's (CZW) Ultraviolent Underground Championship in a \\"Pool of Blood Deathmatch\\". On May 8, Gentaro returned to defending the VKF Championship, when he defeated TKG48 member Shigehiro Irie in the main event to retain the title. The following September, Gentaro left the Kojika Army and on October 27, 2011, defeated The Great Kojika in a singles match. On August 5, 2012, after a match at a Freedoms event, Gentaro was hospitalized and diagnosed with cerebral infarction. Gentaro resumed training in May 2013 and in early 2014 announced he was ready to return to the ring. On May 2, 2014, Gentaro was defeated by Isami Kodaka in his first match in 21 months. On March 5, Gentaro won his Freedoms title, when he and Kenichiro Arai defeated El Hijo del Winger Uno and El Hijo del Winger Dos for the King of Freedom World Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Buffalo and Yuya Susumu in their first defense on March 23. On May 1, Gentaro unsuccessfully challenged Masashi Takeda for the King of Freedom World Championship. On July 25, Gentaro and Takashi Sasaki defeated Kamui and Mammoth Sasaki to win the King of Freedom World Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Kenji Fukimoto and Minoru Fujita four days later. On August 11, 2016, Gentaro defeated The Winger to win the UWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship. After losing the title to Miedo Extremo on November 17, he regained it on December 7. He then lost the title to Yuya Susumu in his third defense on May 2, 2017. ==Championships and accomplishments== *Big Japan Pro Wrestling **BJW Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Takashi Sasaki *Daiwa Entertainment Pro-Wrestling **DEP Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Kenta Kosugi *Dramatic Dream Team / DDT Pro- Wrestling **DDT Extreme Division Championship (1 time) **Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship (4 times) **KO-D Openweight Championship (1 time) **KO-D Tag Team Championship (4 times) – with Yoshiya (1), Takashi Sasaki (2), and Yasu Urano (1) **Right to Challenge Anytime, Anywhere Contract (2011) *Ice Ribbon **International Ribbon Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Mai Ichii *Kageki Pro **Kageki Pro Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Kaientai Dojo **Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **UWA/UWF Intercontinental Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Yoshiya **UWA World Middleweight Championship (1 time) **Best Tag Team Match (2009) with Yoshiya vs. Makoto Oishi and Shiori Asahi on August 9 *Pro Wrestling Freedoms **King of Freedom World Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Kenichiro Arai (1) and Takashi Sasaki (1) **UWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship (2 times) *VKF Wrestle Naniwa **VKF Championship (1 time) *World Entertainment Wrestling / Apache Pro-Wrestling Army **WEW World Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Takashi Sasaki (1) and The Winger (1) *Wrestling Marvelous of the Future **WMF Junior Heavyweight Championship (1 time) ==References *Pro Wrestling Freedoms profile *Official blog Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese male professional wrestlers Category:Masked wrestlers Category:Professional wrestling announcers Category:People from Koganei, Tokyo Category:Sportspeople from Tokyo Metropolis ","title":"Gentaro (wrestler)"},{"id":"35284059","text":"GL Music Entertainment A/S is a label, publishing & TV Production company representing some of the leading Scandinavian songwriters, artists, musicians and producers as well as some of the world's leading independent music publishers.

Takanashi was trained by Dramatic Dream Team (DDT) and has worked for the promotion since his debut in September 2003, becoming a one-time KO-D Openweight Champion, a two-time KO-D Tag Team Champion, a seven-time KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Champion, a two-time DDT Extreme Division Champion, an 18-time Ironman Heavymetalweight Champion and a one-time UWA World Trios Champion. Takanashi is also known for his work in women's wrestling promotion Ice Ribbon, where he performed under the ring name and became a one-time International Ribbon Tag Team and Triangle Ribbon Champion. ==Professional wrestling career== Dramatic Dream Team / DDT Pro-Wrestling (2003–present) Takanashi was first trained in professional wrestling by Último Dragón at his Último Dragón Gym. After failing to graduate from his class, Takanashi moved to the training dojo of the Dramatic Dream Team (DDT) promotion. From August 19 to September 6, 2003, Takanashi wrestled several exhibition matches for DDT, before making his official debut for the promotion on September 14, where he, now working under the shortened ring name Masa Takanashi (spelled in western naming order [given name first]), was defeated by Super Uchu Power. For the rest of the year, Takanashi wrestled mostly opening matches, picking up his first win on December 29, when he pinned Daichi Kakimoto in a six-man tag team match. In early 2004, Takanashi began regularly teaming with Danshoku Dino. On May 29, Takanashi defeated Shoichi Ichimiya in the first round for the inaugural King of DDT tournament. The following day, he was eliminated from the tournament in the semifinals by Danshoku Dino. From April to May 2005, Takanashi represented DDT in Kaientai Dojo's K-Metal League, where he failed to make it to the finals. Upon his return to DDT, Takanashi began wrestling as a representative of DDT's Cruiser's Game project. In January 2006, Takanashi was, in storyline, brought under the spell of Poison Sawada Julie and turned into a human snake. Takanashi would wrestle as a member of Julie's Snake Corps, before managing to break away from the group in May, along with Seiya Morohashi. On June 25, Takanashi won his first championship, when he, working as Masahiro Mekanashi, a character inspired by the Mecha Mummy, defeated Mecha Stanley for the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship. Takanashi then entered a battle royal, where he lost the title to Natsuki☆Head, before regaining it from Mikami and then losing it to Mecha Mummy. Also in 2006, Takanashi made his debut for El Dorado Wrestling, where he worked alongside his Último Dragón Gym training partners as King Pocota. The character then moved to DDT, where he was renamed Poco Takanashi and won the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship two more times, each time holding the title less than a day. On November 23, Takanashi won his first major title, when he and Seiya Morohashi defeated Francesco Togo and Mori Bernard for the KO-D Tag Team Championship. After a five-month reign, Takanashi and Morohashi lost the title to Michael Nakazawa and Tomomitsu Matsunaga on April 1, 2007. After returning to performing as Masa Takanashi, he defeated Danshoku Dino and Kudo in a three-way match on February 20, 2008, to win the DDT Extreme Division Championship. He would go on to lose the title to Francoise Takagi on July 6. During the summer of 2008, Takanashi formed the \\"Belt Hunter×Hunter\\" stable with Danshoku Dino, Hikaru Sato, Keisuke Ishii and Tigers Mask. The stable's storyline rivalry with the Italian Four Horsemen stable built to an eight-man tag team match on December 28, 2008, where the loser of the fall would be banished from DDT. The match ended with Horsemen member Antonio Honda pinning Takanashi for the win; as a result, Takanashi was, in storyline, forced to leave DDT. Takanashi in March 2010 Despite the storyline, Takanashi did not miss a single event held by DDT as in January 2009, he began making appearances for the promotion as Louis Takanashi XIV. On May 21, Takanashi earned his way back into DDT by defeating Sanshiro Takagi in a singles match. During the summer of 2009, Takanashi won four different titles, the DJ Nira World and History's Strongest Championship, the GAY World Anal Championship, the J.E.T. World Jet Championship and the World Mid Breath Championship, all made up by different DDT wrestlers and none of which were officially recognized by the promotion. This built to a nine championship match between Takanashi and Danshoku Dino on August 23, which Dino won to retain his five titles and win Takanashi's four titles. Before the end of the year, Takanashi and Dino reformed the Belt Hunter×Hunter stable. On November 29, Takanashi, Dino and Hikaru Sato defeated the Italian Four Horsemen (Antonio Honda, Francesco Togo and Piza Michinoku) to become the first DDT- promoted UWA World Trios Champions. On January 24, 2010, they lost the title to Tokyo Gurentai (Fujita, Mazada and Nosawa Rongai). On March 14, Takanashi won a fifteen-man battle royal to become the number one contender to DDT's top title, the KO-D Openweight Championship. At the following event on March 21, Takanashi defeated Munenori Sawa to win the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship for the fifth time. He would lose the title to Danshoku Dino six days later in a four-way match, which also included fellow Belt Hunter×Hunter members Hikaru Sato and Keisuke Ishii. Takanashi received his shot at the KO-D Openweight Championship on April 4, but was defeated by defending champion Daisuke Sekimoto, who outweighed him by . The match was recognized as one of the best matches on the Japanese independent circuit in all of 2010 and is considered Takanashi's breakthrough performance. On May 12, DDT announced that Takanashi would be sidelined from in-ring action indefinitely after dislocating his right knee, tearing his anterior cruciate ligament and damaging his medial collateral ligament. Though still unable to wrestle due to his injury, Takanashi resumed working storylines around the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship in May 2011. Takanashi wrestled his return match on June 19, 2011, and before the end of the month, won the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship for the eleventh time. On July 24, Takanashi recruited former opponent, Daisuke Sekimoto, as his tag team partner and together the two of them defeated Harashima and Hero!, Gentaro and Yasu Urano, and Kenny Omega and Michael Nakazawa in a four-way match to become the new KO-D Tag Team Champions. The comedic big man/little man team would lose the title to Homoiro Clover Z (Danshoku Dino and Kota Ibushi) on August 28. On October 23, Takanashi won a sixteen-person rock-paper-scissors tournament to become the number one contender to the KO-D Openweight Championship, but would be defeated in the title match on November 6 by the defending champion, Kudo. On December 3, Takanashi made his American debut, when took part in the Indie Summit 2011, promoted by Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW), in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, wrestling in a three-way match, which was won by Kudo and also included Dick Togo. Later that same day, Takanashi appeared on CZW's internet pay-per-view, Cage of Death 13, wrestling in a ten-man tag team match, where he, Jaki Numazawa, Jun Kasai, Kamui and Yoshihito Sasaki were defeated by Danshoku Dino, Kengo Mashimo, Kudo, Ryuji Ito and Takashi Sasaki. In early 2012, Takanashi began feuding with the Homoiro Clover Z stable. After leading fellow DDT Seikigun members Daisuke Sasaki and Harashima to a six-man tag team victory over Homoiro Clover Z on March 11, the stable's leader, the reigning KO-D Openweight Champion Danshoku Dino, named Takanashi and Sanshiro Takagi his top two contenders for the title. On March 18, Takanashi was defeated by Takagi in a number one contender's main event. On April 1, Takanashi took part in the annual Anytime and Anywhere battle royal, a match combining elements of a regular battle royal and a ladder match, where he managed to grab the \\"Right to Challenge Anytime, Anywhere\\" contract to earn the right to challenge for the KO-D Openweight Championship at a time of his own choosing. Later that same event, Takanashi used his contract, after Sanshiro Takagi had defeated Danshoku Dino to win the KO-D Openweight Championship, and defeated him to become the new champion. On May 4, Takanashi lost the KO-D Openweight Championship to Yuji Hino in his first title defense, ending his reign at 33 days. On June 24, Takanashi and Daisuke Sasaki received a shot at the KO-D Tag Team Championship, but were defeated by the defending champions, Homoiro Clover Z representatives Kudo and Makoto Oishi. On July 8, Takanashi and Sasaki joined Antonio Honda, Hoshitango, Yasu Urano and Yuji Hino to form the Monster Army. The group wrestled its first match together on July 22, when they were defeated by Akito, DJ Nira, Poison Julie Sawada, Rion Mizuki and Tetsuya Endo in a ten-man tag team match, after Hino and Hoshitango began brawling with each other. The brawling continued after the match with Takanashi and Sasaki siding with Hoshitango and Honda and Urano with Hino, which led to Takanashi announcing that the Monster Army was history and that he, Sasaki and Hoshitango were now known as \\"Familia\\". Later that same day, Takanashi made a special appearance for Pro Wrestling Noah, facing former training partner Taiji Ishimori in a losing effort. On August 18 at DDT's 15th anniversary event in Nippon Budokan, Takanashi, Daisuke Sasaki, Hoshitango, Tetsuya Endo and Tsukasa Fujimoto, representing Familia, defeated Antonio Honda, Tanomusaku Toba, Yasu Urano, Yoshiko and Yuji Hino, representing Crying Wolf, in a ten-person tag team match, contested under \\"Soccer rules\\". On August 26, DDT General Manager Amon Tsurumi ordered all stables in the promotion disbanded, effectively ending the short-lived Familia. On September 19, Daisuke Sasaki turned on Takanashi and formed a new stable named \\"Los Calientes\\" with Antonio Honda, who simultaneously turned on Yasu Urano, and Hoshitango. Takanashi responded by announcing that he was forming his own stable with Toru Owashi and Yuji Hino and going after Los Calientes. The two stables faced off on September 30, however, during the match Hino turned on Takanashi, which led to Hoshitango pinning him for the win. Following the match, Honda announced that he, Hoshitango, Sasaki and Hino were reforming the Monster Army, claiming that Takanashi and Urano were the ones who ruined the original stable. Takanashi returned to title contention on June 13, 2013, when he unsuccessfully challenged Kenny Omega for the DDT Extreme Division Championship. Ten days later, Takanashi took part in a nine-man battle royal, during which he won the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship from Gorgeous Matsuno for the twelfth time, only to lose it to Tomomitsu Matsunaga nine seconds later. Takanashi then resumed his rivalry with his former Monster Army stablemates, which built to an eight-man tag team match on August 17, during the first day of DDT's 16th anniversary weekend in Ryōgoku Kokugikan, where he, Akito, Kazuki Hirata and Yukio Sakaguchi defeated Antonio Honda, Daisuke Sasaki, Hoshitango and Yuji Hino. On December 17, Takanashi produced his tenth anniversary event in Tokyo's Tobu Friend Hall, which saw him lose to Kudo in the main event. On January 13, 2014, Takanashi won a four-way match to earn the right to challenge for the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship whenever and wherever he wanted. He used the right later that same event, surprising DDT Triple Crown Champion Harashima with a schoolboy after his match to become the new Ironman Heavymetalweight Champion. On January 26, Takanashi put his new title on the line in a ten-minute battle royal. Early on in the match, Takanashi lost the title to Tomomitsu Matsunaga, but later came back to defeat Yasu Urano, regain the title and leave the match as the reigning champion. Following the main event, Takanashi came out to challenge Harashima for the KO-D Openweight Championship, but was then surprised by Urano, who pinned him to become the new Ironman Heavymetalweight Champion. On February 2, Takanashi failed to recapture the title from Urano in a match billed as a KO-D Openweight Championship number one contender's match. However, following the match, Takanashi revealed that he and Emi Sakura had tricked DDT General Manager Amon Tsurumi into signing a contract making him the number one contender, regardless of the result of the match. Takanashi received his title shot on February 23, but was defeated by the defending champion, Harashima. Takanashi in April 2014 On March 2, Takanashi formed a new stable with Kudo and Yukio Sakaguchi, based on the three's shared love of alcohol. On March 9, the stable was named Shuten-dōji, after a sake drinking oni of the same name. On March 21, Takanashi won his second \\"Right to Challenge Anytime, Anywhere\\" contract in the annual battle royal. However, after Kudo captured the KO-D Openweight Championship later in the main event, Takanashi announced he would not be betraying his \\"brother\\" and using the contract. After holding the contract for only nine days, Takanashi lost it to Kazuki Hirata after being pinned by him in a ten-man tag team match. In April, Shuten-dōji announced they were taking over DDT and every one of its championships with Takanashi being assigned with capturing the DDT Extreme Division Championship as well as the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship alongside his stablemates. The first title match took place on May 4 and saw Shuten-dōji defeat Daisuke Sasaki, Kenny Omega and Kota Ibushi to capture the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship. Shuten-dōji's takeover of DDT continued on May 9, when Takanashi defeated Danshoku Dino to win the DDT Extreme Division Championship for the second time. Takanashi's reign lasted only sixteen days, before he lost the title to Makoto Oishi on May 25. On June 8, Shuten-dōji made their first successful defense of the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship against Smile Squash (Akito, Harashima and Yasu Urano). They lost the title to Happy Motel (Antonio Honda, Konosuke Takeshita and Tetsuya Endo) in their second defense on July 13. Shuten-dōji, however, regained the title from Happy Motel just seven days later in a three-way match, which also included Team Drift (Keisuke Ishii, Shigehiro Irie and Soma Takao). They lost the title to Team Drift on August 17 at DDT's largest event of the year, Ryōgoku Peter Pan 2014. On February 15, 2015, Shuten-dōji won the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship for the third time, defeating previous champions Genpatsu Daio (Brahman Kei, Brahman Shu and Gorgeous Matsuno). Shuten-dōji then entered a series of matches with Team Drift, where the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship changed hands between the two teams three times in six weeks with Shuten-dōji losing the title on March 1, winning it on March 21, and losing it again on April 11. On July 5, Takanashi received a shot at the DDT Extreme Division Championship, but was defeated by the defending champion, Akito, in a Bullrope match. Takanashi received another shot at the title on August 23 at Ryōgoku Peter Pan 2015, but was this time defeated by Antonio Honda. On January 3, 2016, Takanashi was named the number one contender to the KO-D Openweight Championship, after pinning Harashima in a six-man tag team match. He was defeated in the title match on January 31 by Isami Kodaka. On July 17, Takanashi announced he was returning to working under his real name of Masahiro Takanashi. On December 11, Takanashi, Kudo and Sakaguchi defeated Damnation (Daisuke Sasaki, Mad Paulie and Tetsuya Endo) to win the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship for the fifth time. They lost the title to Kazusada Higuchi, Kouki Iwasaki and Mizuki Watase in a three-way match, also involving Antonio Honda, Konosuke Takeshita and Trans-Am★Hiroshi, on January 22, 2017. Takanashi, Kudo and Sakaguchi won the KO-D 6-Man Tag Team Championship for a record-tying sixth time on June 25, 2017, by defeating NωA (Makoto Oishi, Mao and Shunma Katsumata). They were stripped of the title on October 10, when Kudo was sidelined with a concussion. Following Kudo's return, Shuten-dōji won the title for the seventh time by defeating All Out (Akito, Diego and Konosuke Takeshita) on December 10. Ice Ribbon (2006–2012) On October 15, 2006, Takanashi, working under the ring name Ribbon Takanashi, made his debut for the newly founded women's professional wrestling promotion, Ice Ribbon, teaming with Makoto in a losing effort against the team of Choun Shiryu and Riho. Takanashi has wrestled for the promotion regularly ever since, becoming the only male wrestler to hold a regular spot in its roster, while also helping Emi Sakura in training wrestlers for the promotion. On July 29, 2008, Takanashi won his first title in Ice Ribbon, when he, working under his transvestite character Masako Takanashi, teamed with Chounko to defeat Etsuko Mita and Makoto for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship, with the two becoming the first male wrestlers to have held the title. On October 24, they lost the title to Riho and Yuki Sato in their first defense. Returning to the Ribbon Takanashi ring name, Takanashi, teaming with Emi Sakura, attempted to regain the title from Riho and Sato on November 15, but the two were unsuccessful in their challenge. After recovering from his ACL injury, Takanashi, still unable to wrestle, returned to Ice Ribbon on June 15, 2011, losing the Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship to Emi Sakura. Later that day, after title changes involving Remi Nagano and Hikari Minami, Takanashi regained the title from Sakura and returned to DDT with it. In September, Takanashi began wrestling regularly in three-way matches, which built to a match on November 30, where he defeated Neko Nitta and Makoto Oishi to win the Triangle Ribbon Championship, becoming the first male wrestler to have held the title. Takanashi made his first title defense on January 4, 2012, at Shinshun Ribbon, defeating Miyako Matsumoto and Yasu Urano.

K. Harikumar. The film follows Viswanathan, a youth, who struggles within India's reservation system; instead of desiring to advance through his own merits. It portrays the need for the system of reservation in India for economically weaker communities, and those affected by the Caste System. The title of the film means \\"the shattered\\", which echoes the protagonist's feelings toward the perceived limitations of the reservation system. ==Plot== Viswanathan is a postgraduate youth. His father, Kumaran struggles to earn a living through the traditional chat and Pujas, far removed from his son's educational aspirations. The reservation system in India guarantees positions to historically disadvantaged groups. When offered a position based on his poor background rather than his abilities, Viswanathan refuses. He struggles to rectify his own belief in his abilities with the seemingly meritless position offered; a struggle that worsens his feelings of inadequacy. The film explores the differences between the traditional work of the father and the educational job sought by the son, and merit-based advancement versus affirmative action. == Production == Chithariyavar was filmed in Shornur Koonathura. ==Cast and crew== * Sreenivasan as Viswanathan * Mundoor Krishnankutty as Kumaran * Maya Maushmi as Reshma ==Music== Kureepuzha's poem Keezhalar is used as background score in the movie.

Throughout his career, Caspi has combined research with public activity and extensive, lively commentary, publishing hundreds of articles in the printed daily and online press, including regular columns in a Jerusalem local paper, in the Israel Publishers’ Association monthly Otot (\\"Signals\\")' in Haayin Hashviit (\\"The Seventh Eye\\", an online media journal)' the op-ed section of ynet (an online newspaper produced by Yedioth Ahronoth) and a blog for Ha'aretz. == Life and work == Dan Caspi (originally Casapu) was born in Săveni, part of the Moldavia region of northeastern Romania. His family soon relocated to nearby Dorohoi. Although physical handicapped by cerebral palsy(CP), he attended regular local schools in Romania and then in Israel after moving there with his family in 1960, at the age of 14. The family settled in Beersheba, Israel, where Caspi completed high school. In the mid-1960s, Caspi began undergraduate studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in political science and sociology, followed by graduate studies in political science and communications. Caspi’s doctoral thesis, supervised by Elihu Katz and Emanuel Gutmann, assesses Knesset Members’ perception of public opinion, as differentiated from actual public opinion. After receiving his degree in 1976, he spent a year of post-doctoral studies at MIT, under the auspices of Ithiel de Sola Pool., followed by work at other universities, including Rutgers, Manchester, Concordia, the London School of Economics and Paris VIII. During the mid-1980s, Caspi moved to the Open University of Israel and developed a communications studies program, writing and editing a series of textbooks now used at universities, colleges and professional schools in Israel. In 2000, he returned to Beersheba to help establish the Department of Communication Studies at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, a department he headed until 2009. Caspi was married, with a daughter and four grandchildren. He died on 22 January 2017. == Positions == Over the past few years, Caspi has held several academic and public positions: * Member of the Academic Council, Hadassah College, Jerusalem * Head of the Department of Communication Studies and the Burda Center for Innovative Communications, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (2004–2009) * Member of the panel of judges, Nahum Sokolov Prize (2005, 2007 and 2009) * Member of the Israel Broadcasting Authority Executive Board (2000–2003) * Member of the Science Council of the biannual Kesher, Tel Aviv University (since 2005) * Founding President of the Israel Communications Association (1996–1999) * Academic consultant to Tik Tikshoret, Israel Educational Television’s weekly program devoted to media issues (1991–1993) * Academic consultant, Koteret School of Journalism and Communications, Tel Aviv University (1992–1993) * Consultant to the Israel Ministry of Education and Culture for the drafting of special mass media syllabi (1986–1992) * Founder and editor, Medina, Mimshal Veyahasim Beinleumiim [State, Government and International Relations], an Israeli journal of political science (1971–1986) == Research and Publications == Caspi specializes in mass media, media and politics, public opinion and propaganda, media institutions, local media, minority media, media regulation and electoral campaigns.

In the early 1990s, Caspi published pieces critical of their cross-ownership and control of television broadcast channels. One of his newspaper articles at the time, Citizen N. M. (Hadashot, October 8, 1992), coined a lasting nickname for Yedioth Ahronoth publisher Noni Mozes. In the mid-1990s, Caspi revealed that violence against women even occurs in academic circles, breaking his colleagues’ extended silence by publishing an article entitled Don’t Ask Him (People in the Forefront (Haaretz daily supplement), January 27, 1995). The two articles respectively open and close his collection of articles entitled Agenda (see list of Hebrew books, above). == References  External links == * Personal website * דן כספי, לשחרר את רוממה, ynet * * http://blogs.haaretz.co.il/dancaspi/ Category:1945 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People from Săveni Category:Moldavian Jews Category:Romanian emigrants to Israel Category:Ben-Gurion University of the Negev faculty Category:Mass media theorists ","title":"Dan Caspi"},{"id":"35284099","text":"Stephen Payn was Dean of Exeter between 1415 and 1419.Ursula Radford (1955). \\"An Introduction to the Deans of Exeter\\".

Relazione annuale sulla 'ndrangheta, Commissione parlamentare di inchiesta sul fenomeno della criminalità organizzata mafiosa o similare (Relatore: Francesco Forgione), February 2008 =='Ndrangheta heritage == Giuseppe was the second-born son of the undisputed leader of one of the most powerful clans of San Luca, Antonio Pelle and Giuseppa Giampaolo. His older brother Salvatore Pelle, wanted since 1991, was arrested on March 10, 2007, making Giuseppe the acting boss of the clan. Da latitante Salvatore Pelle si muoveva solo con bus e treni , Gazetta del Sud, March 11, 2007 One of the four sons of Antonio Pelle, Giuseppe married Marianna Barbaro, a daughter of the ‘Ndrangheta boss Francesco Barbaro from Platì, securing a tight alliance between these two powerful 'ndrine. Morto Antonio Pelle, \\"patriarca\\" di San Luca , Gazzetta del Sud, November 5, 2009 In March 2010, the police managed to place a bug in the home of Pelle. \\"In the house they talked about the 'Ndrangheta twelve hours a day,\\" according to prosecutor Nicola Gratteri, \\"they felt safe and discussed freely.\\" In just over a month hundreds of meetings were recorded between mafiosi, politicians, entrepreneurs, professionals, businessmen and middlemen of any kind, and even people with links to intelligence services. \\"Sono bastate tre cimici per dare un duro colpo alla 'ndrangheta\\", La Repubblica, September 30, 2011 The conversations confirmed the existence of La Provincia, a provincial commission of the 'Ndrangheta, formed at the end of the Second 'Ndrangheta war in September 1991 to avoid further internal conflicts. They also confirmed that Giuseppe Pelle had succeeded his father and that he was in charge of managing the affairs of the 'Ndrangheta clans on the Ionic side (the Aspromonte mountains and Locride) of Calabria, together with Rocco Morabito, who had succeeded his father Giuseppe Morabito 'u tiradrittu'. (Other so-called mandamenti are those for the Tyrrhenian side (the plains of Gioia Tauro) and one central mandamento for the city of Reggio Calabria) La ‘ndrangheta muta pelle, regole e gerarchie, Gazzetta del Sud, May 23, 2010 The conversations also revealed talks with the politician Santi Zappalà, a member of former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s conservative People of Freedom party and part of the Regional Council of Calabria. Politicians running for office in regional elections held in March 2010 visited the house of Giuseppe Pelle offering favourable treatment for 'Ndrangheta inmates and public works contracts if he would deliver votes. Zappala turned out to be the second most voted candidate in the province of Reggio and fourth in the region of Calabria. In December 2010 he was arrested.Five politicians arrested for allegedly offering the mafia favours for votes, ADN Kronos, December 21, 2010 ==Aspiring to become capo crimine== Giuseppe Pelle aspired to replace his ailing father Antonio Gambazza Pelle as capo crimine and keep the title in San Luca at the risk of triggering a conflict between clans.

National Gallery, London. Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine is a glue-size on linen painting by Flemish artist Quentin Matsys, probably painted c 1515-25\\\\. The Virgin Mary is shown on a throne, holding the Infant Jesus, between Barbara and Catherine of Alexandria, two saints popular in the early 16th century and considered the most important of the venerated Fourteen Holy Helpers. Jesus leans forward to place a ring on Catherine's finger, a reference to her vision in which she was to given Jesus by Mary in mystical marriage. Other indicators of the saints identities include the broken wheel - which refers to the torture of Catherine- and the tower, an allusion to Barbara's imprisonment and eventual beheading at the hands of her father.Jones, 104 Because of the high perishability of linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue used as a binder, this work, along with Dirk Bouts' Entombment (c. 1440-55), is rare surviving example of the technique.\\"The Entombment\\".

The painting was built up in a two-stage process where layers of darker pigments over which progressively lighter tones were added.Jones, 11 For example, Catherine's dress began with an underlayer of dark blue over which a lines of brighter blue was added to create the illusion of vertical folds in the cloth. This technique of dark to light is the opposite to the general approach with oils where darker colours are layered on lighter pigments.

It was the composer's first popular success, since it was his first venture into opera after the relative failure in the previous year of Clari. ==Composition history== Léon Halévy was offered the uncompleted libretto of Le dilettante by Hoffmann's son.Halévy (1864), p. 19 He developed it into a witty satire on Italian music, and the work was premiered at the Opéra-Comique on 7 November 1829. The libretto contains some sly fun about the composer; like the imposter 'Imbroglio', Fromental Halévy himself was a graduate of the Prix de Rome, and was at the time of the premiere a 'chef du chant' (singing director), in this case at the Paris Opéra. It was well received by the critics, becoming the composer's first popular success, running for 119 performances. Moreover, the publisher Maurice Schlesinger was impressed by it, published the score and took Halévy into his stable.Jourdan (1994), p. 32 ==Roles== Louis Ponchard, who created the role of Imbroglio {  !Role !Voice type !Premiere cast, 7 November 1829Halevy (1829) (Conductor: ) - Maisonneuve, known as 'Casanova', director of the Avignon theatre bass Fargueil - Élise, his daughter, known as 'Corinaldi' soprano Marie Casimir - Marianne, his niece, known as 'Marinetta'  Monsel - Dubreuil, singing director, known as 'Imbroglio' tenor Louis Ponchard - Valentin, actor  Boulard - Zuccherini, premier tenor tenor Belnie - Ribomba, comic singer  St. Ange - Poverino, a soprano singer  Jamain - Amateurs, dilettantes, theatre chorus  } ==Synopsis== :Place: The foyer of a theatre in Avignon :Time: The charlatan director 'Casanova' (in fact a Frenchman) claims to love only Italian music.

The singing director at the theatre, also posing as an Italian, is enamoured with the daughter of 'Casanova'. Eventually all is revealed, and everyone agrees that the best thing would be to use the best points of both the French and Italian traditions.Jourdan (1994), 31-2; Halevy (1829) ==Recordings== *Le dilettante d’Avignon Michel Piquemal 2CD 2019 ==References== Notes Sources * Halevy, Léon, Le dilettante d'Avignon, opéra comique en un acte, Paris, 1829.

The intercostal spaces are only moderately impressed. They are about as wide as the ribs. The sutures are well impressed. The periphery of the body whorl is well rounded. The base of the shell is moderately long, and well rounded. The aperture is suboval. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is short, stout, twisted, and provided with a weak fold at its insertion.Dall & Bartsch (1909), A Monograph of West American Pyramidellid Mollusks, United States National Museum Bulletin 68, p.39 ==Distribution== The type specimen was found in the Pacific Ocean off San Diego, California. ==References * To USNM Invertebrate Zoology Mollusca Collection * To World Register of Marine Species kelseyi Category:Gastropods described in 1909 ","title":"Turbonilla kelseyi"},{"id":"35284278","text":"Turbonilla kerstinae is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.Bouchet, P.

Of these ribs 20 occur upon the first and 18 upon the remaining turns. The shallow intercostal spaces are about three times as wide as the ribs, crossed by 13 slender incised spiral lines of somewhat varying width. Of these lines the first to fifth, seventh and twelfth are mere incised lines, while the sixth, eighth, tenth, and eleventh are about twice as wide as these, and the ninth and thirteenth are double the width of the last. The space between the summit and the first is as wide as the space between the eighth and ninth, which is doubly as wide as that separating the first five lines, which are subequally spaced. The spaces between the eighth and ninth, ninth and tenth, tenth and eleventh, and eleventh and twelfth increase steadily in width, the space between the first of this series being about one-half as wide as that separating the last. The suture is moderately constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is angulated. The base of the shell is short, and well rounded. It is marked by the feeble continuations of the axial ribs, which become evanescent before reaching the middle of the base, and 12 feebly incised, slender, wavy, spiral striations, which become successively weaker and closer spaced from the periphery toward the umbilical area. The aperture is subquadrate. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin.

The whorls of the protoconch of the type specimen are decollated and the first three whorls of the teleoconch are probably lost. The remaining 9¼ whorls of the teleoconch are flattened. They are situated very high between the sutures, and slightly excurved immediately below the feebly shouldered summit. They are marked by very regular and regularly spaced well-rounded, slightly protractive axial ribs of which 20 occur upon all the remaining turns excepting the last two. Of these the penultimate has 24 and the last 32. The intercostal spaces are a little narrower than the ribs. They are marked by 17 spiral series of pits of which the first 16 are subequal and subequally spaced. The last, the peripheral pit is a little wider than the rest and separated from the sixteenth by a space about five times as wide as those separating the other pits. The first pit is about as far anterior to the summit as the sixteenth is distant from the seventeenth. The suture is slightly contracted. The periphery of the body whorl is well rounded. The base of the shell is attenuated marked by the very feeble continuation of the axial ribs and eight wavy incised spiral lines which are of about the same strength but not of equal spacing. A broad band separates the peripheral line of pits from the first basal line. The next three lines are closely and equally spaced, while the fourth is a little farther from the third than that is from the second, and the distance between the fourth and fifth is in equal proportions greater than that between the third and fourth. The rest are again narrowly and about equally spaced. The aperture is elongate oval. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin showing the external sculpture within by transmitted light. The inner lip is slightly curved reflected and appressed to the attenuated base for almost its entire length. It is provided with a very oblique, strong fold at its insertion.

Its color is light wax yellow, with a supra and subperipheral light chestnut band, separated by a very narrow, dark wax yellow peripheral zone. (The whorls of the protoconch and probably the first two whorls of the teleoconch are decollated.) The nine remaining whorls are situated rather high between the sutures. The early ones are marked by moderately strong, broad, low, almost vertical axial ribs, which become quite obsolete on the last turn and a half. About 22 of these ribs appear upon the eighth whorl. The intercostal spaces are narrow and weakly impressed. The sutures are well rounded. The periphery and the base of the body whorl are well rounded, the latter marked by continuations of the obsolete riblets and the fine, close, wavy spiral striations which also cover the entire surface of the spire. The aperture is oval. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin. The columella is slender, oblique, slightly curved and revolute, with a slight fold at its insertion.

Its color is light yellow, with a broader darker yellow band immediately below the summit and another halfway between this and the suture. The 1¾ whorls of the protoconch are large. They form a depressed helicoid spire. Its axis is at right angles to that of the succeeding turns, on the first of which it rests, but is not immersed.

They are marked by slender, very regular, slightly curved, well rounded, somewhat retractive axial ribs, of which 24 occur upon the first, 22 upon the second and third, 24 upon the fourth and fifth, 26 upon the sixth and seventh, and about 32 upon the penultimate whorl. The intercostal spaces are about as wide as the ribs, and well impressed. They are marked by fifteen equal and equally spaced spiral series of pits, which owing to the narrowness of the intercostal spaces, appear as mere punctations. The sutures are well marked. The periphery of the body whorl is without spiral sculpture. The base of the shell is moderately long. It is marked by the continuations of the axial ribs, and six equal and equally spaced spiral striations on its anterior two-thirds. The aperture is oval. The posterior angle is acute.

The remaining 9½ whorls of the teleoconch are flattened very high between the sutures, and narrowly shouldered at the summit. They are marked by closely crowded, quite regular, well rounded, almost straight, slightly protractive axial ribs;18 ribs occur upon the first four of the remaining turns; 20 upon the fifth to seventh; 22 upon the eighth, and 26 upon the penultimate whorl. The intercostal spaces are a little narrower than the ribs. They are marked by 13 strongly incised, subequal and subequally spaced pits. The suture is moderately constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is well rounded. The base of the shell attenuated, and well rounded. It is marked by the feeble continuation of the ribs which reach to the umbilical chink and five equal and equally spaced, moderately broad, shallow, incised lines of a rust brown color. The aperture is elongate oval. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The inner lip is slender, moderately curved, reflected over and adnate to the attenuated base for two-thirds of its length. It is and provided with a strong oblique fold at its insertion.

He went to a private school at Southampton, and then returned to Nottingham, where he attended chemical lectures by a Mr. Grisenthwaite at the local school of medicine. He wished to become a chemist; but his father's wish was that he should graduate in medicine, and in April 1834 he was taken by his brother Edmund to Paris to begin his medical studies. While in Paris he attended the lectures of Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thénard on chemistry, and of Antoine Laurent de Jussieu on botany. In 1836 Percy went for a tour in Switzerland and the south of France, and made a collection of mineralogical and botanical specimens. He went on to Edinburgh, where he became a pupil of Sir Charles Bell and a friend of Edward Forbes. In 1838 he graduated M.D. in the university, and received a gold medal for a thesis on the presence of alcohol in the brain after poisoning by that substance. In 1839 he was elected physician to the Queen's Hospital, Birmingham, but, having private means, did not practise. Local industry excited his interest in metallurgy. In 1846 he worked with David Forbes and William Hallowes Miller on crystallised slags. In 1847 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and served on the council from 1857 to 1859. In 1851 he was elected Fellow of the Geological Society, and was appointed lecturer on metallurgy at the newly founded Metropolitan School of Science in London, under Sir Henry Thomas de la Beche; the post was later made a professorship. Percy exerted influence, while holding this position, on metallurgy as a discipline, and through his pupils. The silver process was the only metallurgical one he actually invented, but his work suggested others; and the Gilchrist-Thomas process for making Bessemer steel from iron ores containing phosphorus was an outcome of his work, and was discovered by pupils. In 1851 he undertook to superintend the analysis of a large number of specimens of iron and steel collected by his friend Samuel Holden Blackwell (which went to the Jermyn Street Museum). His results were an early attempt at a survey of national resources of iron ore. Percy was appointed lecturer on metallurgy to the artillery officers at Woolwich, around 1864, and retained this post till his death. He was appointed superintendent of ventilation, etc., of the Houses of Parliament on 6 February 1865. He was also a member of the Secretary for War's commissions on the application of iron for defensive purposes (1861), and on \\"Gibraltar\\" shields (1867), and of the royal commissions on coal (1871), and on the spontaneous combustion of coal in ships (1875). In 1876 he was awarded the Bessemer medal of the Iron and Steel Institute, of which he was president during 1885 and 1886. In December 1879 the government decided to complete the removal of the Royal School of Mines from the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street to South Kensington. Objecting strongly, Percy twice offered to rebuild the metallurgical laboratory in Jermyn Street; but his offer was refused, and in December 1879 he resigned. Percy circulated a pamphlet containing his views on the subject In 1887 he was awarded the Millar prize of the Institute of Civil Engineers. In 1889 Percy received the Albert Medal of the Society of Arts on his deathbed, with the words, \\"My work is done\\". He died on 19 June 1889. He had married, in 1839, Grace, daughter of John Piercy of Warley Hall, Birmingham; she died in 1880. Percy frequented the Athenæum Club and Garrick Club, and wrote letters to The Times, under the signature \\"Y\\"; and he denounced the Home Rule movement in his presidential address to the Iron and Steel Institute in 1886. His collection of water-colour drawings and engravings was dispersed by sale in 1890; the manuscript catalogue of the water-colour drawings was bought by the British Museum. Percy's collection of metallurgical specimens went to the South Kensington Museum. ==Works== * Experiments [on] the Presence of Alcohol in the Ventricles of the Brain after Poisoning by that Liquid [1839]. * On the Importance of Special Scientific Knowledge to the Practical Metallurgist (government publication), 1852. * On the Metallurgical Treatment and Assaying of Gold Ores, 1852; 2nd edition, 1853. * A Treatise on Metallurgy, including vol. i. On Fuel, Copper, Zinc, and Brass; vol. ii. On Iron and Steel, 1864, 2nd edition 1875; vol. iii. On Lead, 1870; and vol. iv. On Silver and Gold, 1880. His 1851 survey resulted were embodied in the volume on Iron and Steel. This treatise was the first work of its kind written in modern times. It remained uncompleted, but contained over 3,500 terse pages of describing metallurgical processes, discussion of the chemical problems they involve, often based on the author's original research, and of suggestions for future investigation. The book was translated into French and German, and became a classic. It included work on alloys, Percy's discovery of aluminium bronze, and his view that in many places the Iron Age preceded the Bronze Age. * On the Manufacture of Russian Sheet-Iron, 1871. The Royal Society's Catalogue (vols. iv. viii. and x.) listed 21 papers published by Percy singly, one with W. H. Miller, and one with R. Smith. Besides these he published two presidential addresses to the Iron and Steel Institute in their Journal (1885, i. 8, and 1886, i. 29), and an article On Steel Wire of High Tenacity (1886, i. 162). In 1848 he contributed a paper to The Chemist (vol. i. p. 248) on a mode of extracting silver from its ores (depending on the solubility of the chloride in sodium thiosulphate), led to the Von Patera process, used at Joachimsthal, and the Russell process, used in the western United States. ==References== * Category:1817 births Category:1889 deaths Category:English chemists Category:19th-century English medical doctors Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Presidents of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh ","title":"John Percy (metallurgist)"},{"id":"35284464","text":"Turbonilla mermeroglaphyra is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.WoRMS (2010).

The REC Diocese of Mid-America is distinct from a diocese of the same name of the Anglican Province of America, which is not affiliated with the Anglican Church in North America. It has 34 congregations, 32 in 12 American states, which are Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas and Wisconsin, and 2 congregations in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Its headquarters are located in Katy, Texas. The Bishop Ordinary was the late Royal U. Grote, Jr., replaced upon his passing by the Bishop Coadjutor, Ray R. Sutton. ==History== The origin of the Diocese of Mid- America goes back to 1990, when the Reformed Episcopal Church at its General Council decided to create the Special Jurisdiction of North America (SJNA) to cover parishes located west of the Mississippi River. The original territory covered 27 states. Their first Missionary Bishop elected was Royal U. Grote Jr, who moved to Houston, Texas, in July 1991.Diocese of Mid-America History In 1996, the merger of the Special Jurisdiction of North America with the Synod of Chicago, the oldest of the Reformed Episcopal Church, led to the creation of the Diocese of Mid-America. A portion of the Diocese of Mid- America was combined with portions of the Diocese of the Northeast and Mid- Atlantic and the Diocese of the Southeast to form the Missionary Diocese of the Central States. Another portion of the Diocese of Mid-America was also split off to help form the Diocese of the West. The Reformed Episcopal Church took part in the Anglican realignment movement that led to the birth of the Anglican Church of North America, of which it was a founding member. The then six jurisdictions, including the Diocese of Mid-America, were in their original founding dioceses. On 2 December 2012, the Church of the Holy Communion, in Dallas, was declared a Pro-Cathedral by Royal U. Grote, Jr..DALLAS, TX: REC Church of the Holy Communion proclaimed a Pro Cathedral, Virtue Online Website The Diocese of Western Canada and Alaska, created in 1996, had two parishes in British Columbia, led by the Rt. Rev. Charles Dorrington, and also included the Missionary District of Cuba. Due to his small size, the diocese was extinct and incorporated in the Diocese of Mid- America, of which is now a part as the Convocation of the West and Western Canada, with Charles Dorrington as Assisting Bishop for Canada and Cuba.Diocese of Mid-America at the Reformed Episcopal Church Official Website ==References *REC Diocese of Mid-America Official Website Category:Dioceses of the Anglican Church in North America Category:Anglican realignment Category:Anglican dioceses established in the 21st century ","title":"Diocese of Mid-America"},{"id":"35284611","text":"This is a list of Australian composers of classical music.

The film stars Walter Slezak and Bryan Russell. It was shot at the Tempelhof Studios in Berlin and on location around the city. The sets were designed by the art directors Isabella and Werner Schlichting. ==Plot== Ten-year old Emil Tischbein travels by bus from Neustadt to Berlin, carrying an envelope containing 400 marks that his mother has entrusted him to deliver to his grandmother. Emil falls asleep during the bus ride and wakes up to find the money gone. He is sure that the thief is Grundeis, the shifty man who was sitting next to him. Emil follows Grundeis to a Berlin cafe and summons a policeman, but Grundeis escapes to a rendezvous with The Baron, his underworld associate. Emil enlists the help of a group of child \\"detectives\\" led by the street urchin Gustav, and together they track down Grundeis and overhear him plotting with The Baron and his accomplice Müller to rob a large Berlin bank by tunneling to its vault. Emil is captured and forced to assist in the criminal plot.

He was portrayed by Roger Allam in the docudrama Who Bombed Birmingham? (also presented as The Investigation: Inside a Terrorist Bombing).Who Bombed Birmingham? at the Internet Movie Database He came to America in 2000 to run the joint venture between The New York Times and Granada Television. In 2002 he won a News and Documentary Emmy as executive producer of a program for NOVA about bioterrorism. In 2007 he joined Zodiak New York to run its office, before joining Cineflix Productions an Executive Vice President in 2009, becoming President in 2013.Charles Tremayne, President, Production, Cineflix Productions He is Chairman of BAFTA New York:BAFTA New York announces Board Elections 2013 Results and a Fellow of the Royal Television Society. He lives in New York with his wife, Caroline, and their two children. ==World in Action== Tremayne joined Granada Television’s World in Action in 1983 from the BBC where he had been a graduate news trainee. His debut program for the series is believed to be the first ‘life swap’ program on television when he challenged Conservative MP, Matthew Parris, to survive for a week on welfare payments. The controversial program was one of the highest rated programs in the series’ history. Parris later became a successful correspondent for The Times. Shortly afterwards Tremayne joined forces with author and politician Chris Mullin to investigate the case of the Birmingham Six and the safety of their conviction for setting off IRA bombs in pubs in Birmingham. Along with producer Ian McBride and researcher Eamon O’Connor, the resulting series of programs eventually led to the release of the six men and the establishment of a Royal Commission on Criminal Justice. Another controversial investigation, with journalist Tony Watson, exposed the activities of the Economic League, a privately financed organization set up to stop ‘subversives’ working in industry. The three programs led to the collapse of the organization. In 1990 he co-authored a book with journalist Mark Hollingsworth called The Economic League – The Silent McCarthyism. He and Mark Hollingsworth later teamed up on a program into the illegal activities of former MP, John Browne, which eventually led to his resignation. ==Granada Television== In 1990 Tremayne became Editor of Regional Features for Granada before becoming an Executive Producer overseeing the long running daytime series, This Morning. In 1993, he returned to World in Action as its Executive Producer, before taking over all current affairs and documentaries for Granada. In this period, under the leadership of editor Steve Boulton, World in Action had one of its most well known investigations looking into the financial affairs of Defense Minister, Jonathan Aitken. As a result of the program, Jonathan Aitken accused Granada and the Guardian newspaper of libel. In the resulting court case, Aitken was found to have lied to the court and was later imprisoned for perjury. In 1999, ITV made the decision to bring World in Action to an end. Granada was successful for winning the competitive tender for its replacement, Britain’s first news magazine show, Tonight with Trevor McDonald. Tremayne worked with editor Jeff Anderson to launch the series, which debuted with a controversial interview obtained by journalist Martin Bashir with the five men suspected of the Stephen Lawrence murder.Tremayne, Charles.Letters: A robust defence of the Lawrence TV interviews, The Guardian, 10 April 1999Kamal Ahmed, The case for the accused, The Guardian 5 April 1999 In 2000 he was invited to move to the USA to start a joint venture between Granada and The New York Times. ==New York== From 2000, Tremayne partnered with journalists of The New York Times to produce programs for PBS, Discovery, TLC and A&E;, including programs for NOVA and Frontline. After the terrorist attacks of 9/11 the team produced many programs for Investigative Reports on A&E;, including a critically acclaimed two-hour special, Anatomy of 9/11. In 2002 their special for NOVA on bioterrorism won a News and Documentary Emmy. In 2002, when the joint venture came to an end, Tremayne became Executive Vice President for Granada America, whose New York production office made hundreds of hours of programming for American cable channels. He created the long running Room Raiders for MTV, and also co-created, with John X Kim, The First 48 on A&E.; In 2007 Tremayne joined RDF USA as Executive Vice President overseeing the east coast production base in New York, which included the production of ABC’s Wife Swap.

He is a right-handed batsman who also plays as a wicket-keeper. ==Life and career== James Regan was born in Frimley, Surrey on 30 May 1994. Regan attended St Patrick's Catholic Primary School, Farnborough and All Hallows Catholic School, Farnham before moving onto King's College, where he scored runs heavily. Regan joined the Somerset County Cricket Club academy in 2011 and featured significantly for the Somerset Second XI towards the end of the summer with both bat and gloves. Regan made his first-class debut for Somerset against Cardiff MCC University on 31 March 2012, following the decision to rest senior wicket-keepers Jos Buttler and Craig Kieswetter. Regan didn't bat in Somerset's only innings of the match and failed to take a catch behind the stumps. Regan then kept wicket for part of the two-day match against the touring South Africans in July 2012. Regan spent the 2012–13 winter playing grade cricket for Latrobe Cricket Club in Tasmania, Australia. In 2013, Regan played regularly for the Somerset 2nd XI but his only first team match was against Cardiff MCCU in a three-day match. Having played regularly and scored well with the bat for the Second XI in the 2014 season, Regan was expected to make his break through into the first team in 2015. However, before the career-ending injury to Craig Kieswetter, Regan broke his metacarpal on his right index finger just on the knuckle. With Alex Barrow as the only fit wicket-keeper in the squad, the county signed Michael Bates as cover. At the end of the 2015 season, Regan was released by Somerset. Regan subsequently announced that he would retrain as an independent financial advisor, with Taunton-based Cooper Associates. He now works in the mortgage division of the company and looks after a number of clients from within cricket. ==ReferencesCategory:1994 births Category:Living people Category:People from Frimley Category:People educated at King's College, Taunton Category:English cricketers Category:Somerset cricketers Category:English footballers Category:Taunton Town F.C. players Category:Chard Town F.C. players Category:Association footballers not categorized by position ","title":"James Regan (cricketer)"},{"id":"35284952","text":"Sirugudi is a village located in Natham Taluk in dindigul District, Tamil Nadu State, India.

Her body was found on 24 March 2011 near Uffington in Oxfordshire. On 19 October 2012, at Bristol Crown Court, Christopher Halliwell, 48, pleaded guilty to O'Callaghan's murder. == Timeline == Savernake Forest was searched extensively by police and members of the public At 02:52 UTC on 19 March 2011, O'Callaghan was captured on CCTV leaving Swindon's Suju nightclub to walk to the flat in Swindon's old town that she shared with her boyfriend, Kevin Reape. Reape sent O'Callaghan an SMS at 03:24; analysis later showed that her mobile phone was in the Savernake Forest area, away, at the time the message was received. At 09:45, Reape contacted the police and reported O'Callaghan as missing. On 20 March, the police issued their first public appeal for information, and announced that they had begun searching Savernake Forest. They stated that the time that elapsed between O'Callaghan's appearance on the club's CCTV and her mobile phone signal (02:52 and 03:24 respectively) meant that the journey from Swindon to the forest could only have been made in a vehicle. On 22 March, approximately 400 members of the public joined the police in their search of the forest. The same day, an anonymous donor offered a £20,000 reward for information that would lead to finding O'Callaghan. On 23 March, police announced that analysis of O'Callaghan's mobile phone signals led to the identification of a number of \\"hot spots\\" to be investigated. Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher of Wiltshire Police said that the investigation was moving at a \\"rapid pace\\", and that \\"significant lines of inquiry\\" were being developed. Members of the public were asked to stand down from searches. On 24 March, police made an urgent appeal for witnesses of a green Toyota Avensis with taxi markings, which had been seen between Swindon and Savernake Forest shortly after O'Callaghan's disappearance.  Arrest and discovery of body  O'Callaghan went missing from Swindon and her body was found near Uffington (top-right). Savernake Forest is located at the bottom of the map. On the afternoon of 24 March, police arrested a 47-year-old taxicab driver from Swindon on suspicion of kidnapping. The arrest was made at an Asda supermarket in north Swindon, where a green Toyota Avensis taxi was also seized. Later the same day, O'Callaghan's body was found in a shallow grave near Uffington, Oxfordshire. On 26 March the suspect was charged with O'Callaghan's murder. == Investigation == During a news conference on 26 March, Fulcher stated that tests revealed that O'Callaghan had not been sexually assaulted. On 1 April, the inquest at Oxford coroner's court was told that it was likely O'Callaghan died from head injuries, though a forensic pathologist from the Home Office had yet to confirm a precise cause of death. == Funeral == O'Callaghan's funeral was held at Kingsdown Crematorium on 18 April 2011.Tearful crowds say farewell to murdered Sian O'Callaghan == Trial and subsequent events == On 31 May 2012, taxi driver Christopher Halliwell appeared in court at a plea and case management hearing, and pleaded not guilty to the charge of murdering Sian O'Callaghan. On 19 October 2012, he appeared at Bristol Crown Court and pleaded guilty to her murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum tariff of 25 years. The Court of Appeal upheld the sentence on 14 December 2012. Following the guilty plea, it emerged that a second murder charge against Halliwell had been dropped as a result of an error in the police handling of the case. The body of Becky Godden-Edwards, a woman who had been reported missing in 2007, was found after Halliwell's arrest. Halliwell had led police to the body. Justice Laura Cox ruled that Halliwell's confessions to killing each of the women were inadmissible as evidence, as Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher had breached the guidelines of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 by failing to caution Halliwell and denying him access to a solicitor during the period that the confessions were obtained. On 23 April 2013, an inquest at Oxford Coroner's Court into the death of Becky Godden-Edwards recorded a narrative verdict stating that the cause of her death, believed to have been in 2003, was \\"unascertained but probably caused unlawfully by a third party.\\" In September 2013, the Independent Police Complaints Commission published the result of an investigation, which found that Fulcher had a case to answer for gross misconduct for breaches of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and for ignoring force orders. In January 2014, Fulcher was found guilty of gross misconduct and given a final written warning by a disciplinary tribunal. In May 2014, Fulcher resigned from Wiltshire Police. Karen Edwards, the mother of Becky Godden-Edwards, commented: \\"Had he have followed the guidelines, then Becky would never have been found, she would have never have come into the equation.\\" On 31 March 2016, Christopher Halliwell was charged with the murder of Becky Godden-Edwards before magistrates in Chippenham, Wiltshire. On 19 September 2016, a jury at Bristol Crown Court found him guilty of the murder after two hours of deliberation. On 23 September, Justice John Griffith Williams sentenced Halliwell to life imprisonment with a whole life order for the murder, meaning he will not be eligible for parole and is unlikely to ever be released from prison. ==Television drama based on the case== On 2 September 2019, ITV broadcast the first episode of A Confession, a six-part drama series based on the case, with Martin Freeman playing Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher and Joe Absolom playing Christopher Halliwell. == References  *Sian O'Callaghan murder: how taxi driver's confession was secured Steven Morris, The Guardian, 9 September 2013. *Child Bereavement UK: Family memorial Category:2011 murders in the United Kingdom Category:2011 in England Category:Crime in Oxfordshire Category:Crime in Wiltshire Category:Date of death unknown Category:Kidnappings in the United Kingdom Category:March 2011 crimes Category:March 2011 events in the United Kingdom Category:Deaths by person in the United Kingdom Category:Murder in England ","title":"Murder of Sian O'Callaghan"},{"id":"35284963","text":"Interior Therapy with Jeff Lewis is an American reality television series that debuted March 14, 2012, on Bravo. It is a spin-off from Lewis' other Bravo show Flipping Out, and features both Jenni Pulos and Zoila Chavez. ==Format== The show features Jeff Lewis and Jenni Pulos visiting the homes of clients and staying with them while a renovation takes place. As well as redecorating, Lewis attempts to rectify problems with his clients' relationships. ==Production== During season two of Flipping Out, executives at Bravo began pitching spin-off show ideas to Lewis, as they initially saw the original show as having a lifespan of around three seasons. Most of the pitches were generic home improvement shows, and Lewis argued to keep a reality television element in the new project. The show wasn't designed to replace Flipping Out, but instead airs earlier in the year than Lewis' first Bravo show. Interior Therapy was announced as one of eleven new shows on Bravo on March 30, 2011, with production by Authentic Entertainment. The show features both Jenni Pulos and Zoila Chavez in addition to Lewis from Flipping Out. The cast launched the show at the Bravo presentation at the Television Critics Association in January 2012. At the end of one of the episodes, the couple splits up. One of the producers wanted to film it in a way which would present it as a happy ending, but Lewis argued for a more authentic finish. He later described it as his favorite episode of the first season. The series airs on Arena in Australia.

The show was produced by Endemol Globo and presented by Pedro Bial. The thirteenth season was officially confirmed since March 2012 as part of a millionaire contract between international Endemol and Globo, which guaranteed seasons until 2016. The grand prize was R$1.5 million with tax allowances, with a R$150,000 prize offered to the runner up and a R$50,000 prize offered to the 3rd placed housemate. The season was the first to be broadcast in HD and the first to be broadcast in 3D worldwide. As part of the twist for this season, six (seven later) former housemates re-entered the Big Brother House for another chance to win the grand prize, bringing the total number of finalists to twenty-one. Fani Pacheco was the only veteran to place higher than in her original season (7th to 6th) while other returnees ranked lower. ==Production== Cast Regional applications were due from March 30, 2012 to July 30, 2012. Regional auditions were held in nine different cities over Brazil. National applications started on July 31, 2012 until October 31, 2012. The semi-finalist interviews were held in November 2012 and the final casting interviews took place early in December 2012. ==The Game== Glass House On January 5, 2013, six housemates were locked for seven days in a Glass House located at Santana Parque Shopping in São Paulo. It was announced that Marcello received the most votes among the males, while Kamilla received the most votes among the females. Both therefore left the Glass House on January 11, 2013, and entered the main house on January 14, 2013. Veterans vs. Newbies For the first Head of Household (HoH) competition of the season, Big Brother divided the housemates into two teams: the Veterans and the Newbies. When a housemate from a team won the role of the Head of Household, then all members of that team were automatically immune from eviction. Bambam walks away On January 12, 2013, Big Brother Brasil 1 winner and current HoH at the time, Bambam, walked out of the game. At the live show on the same day, the Veterans decided as a group that Fani would be the new HoH. Following that, Yuri Fernandes from Big Brother Brasil 12 entered the house as Bambam's replacement. Power of No Introduced in previous season, the Power of No still gives the Monday Game Night winner, the opportunity to disqualify a number of people (previously determined by the producers) from competing in the Head of Household competition alongside the previous HoH. This season however, started on week 4, the vetoed housemates could remove themselves from the block and compete for HoH if they win the Save Me Challenge, which takes place on Wednesdays nights. {  style=\\"width:90%; text-align:center; font-size:85%; line- height:13px;\\" - !

The housemate with the most votes would be immediately evicted on Saturday, January 26. In reality, the public voted for which housemate between the two fake nominees Anamara and Marcello, would enter the Secret Room and be able to watch their fellow housemates on a television screen, and then return to the house on Sunday, as the real HoH of the week. Anamara won with 57% and was fake evicted on day 19, but returned the following day during the real live nominations.

Around 10:00am, Kamilla was the first to be entered the pantry and 'disappeared' from the house, leaving the remaining housemates worried about her whereabouts. At 7:00pm, producers told the housemates to pack Kamilla's belongings to lead them thinking she was out of the game. Around 11:30pm, Kamilla finally returned to the house during the Disco party and then, explained to her shocked fellow housemates what happened to her. Running Against Time On February 21, 2013, Big Brother revealed to the public that the Big Phone would rang on Friday, February 22 at 6:00am. Whoever answered would be automatically nominated for eviction. At 12:00pm, a giant stopwatch counting down 20 hours would be placed in the garden. On top of it there would be a button. The first housemate who pressed the button would stop the countdown and win a surprise immunity. However, if the housemate who was previously nominated by the Big Phone pressed the button, this housemate would win the immunity and choose his replacement nominee. At 6:00am, Eliéser answered the Big Phone and was automatically nominated. At 12:03pm, Fernanda pressed the buttom and stopped the countdown but she was only informed about her immunity during the live nominations on February 24, 2013. The Mystery Box On March 7, 2013, Big Brother announced the first twist of week 9. On Friday, March 8, at 12:00pm, a mystery box would be placed in the garden. To open the mystery box, the housemates would have to find the right key, between thirty hidden keys scattered throughout the outdoor area of the house. The first housemate who opened the box would win a R$10.000 cash prize, choose one housemate to be automatically nominated for eviction and veto other two housemates from the Power of Immunity competition. The mystery box ended up being placed in the house only at 2:30pm due this week's HoH endurance competition overrun. Andressa and Kamilla found the box in the garden around 3:30pm. Andressa beat Kamilla and found right key first, winning the challenge. It's Not What It Seems Also on March 7, Big Brother revealed the second twist of week 9: new housemate Miguel, supposedly from Gran Hermano Argentina, entered the house on March 8. However, in reality, he was an actor working for Big Brother. His mission was told the housemates that he would choose one of them to win immunity and spend a week in the Argentinian house. The truth was partly revealed on March 10, during the live nominations. Host Pedro Bial only told the housemates that there was no immunity up for grabs and continued to hide the fact that Miguel was an actor and not a Gran Hermano housemate. After that, Miguel left the house promising to Fani (whom he had a brief showmance) that he will wait for her outside, which she replied stating \\"I loved it all! I will never ever forget it. Not ever\\". ==Housemates== Newbies The newbies cast list was unveiled on January 3, 2013.

The race was run on April 1, 2012 in Birmingham, Alabama, United States at Barber Motorsports Park. ==Report== Background The first race of the 2012 IndyCar Series season in St. Petersburg, saw Hélio Castroneves capture his first victory since the 2010 season. Along with Castroneves, Scott Dixon and Ryan Briscoe were able to take advantage and lead throughout the race. Entering into the 2012 Indy Grand Prix of Alabama, Castroneves leads in the drivers' championship with 51 points, while Chevrolet leads in the manufacturers' championship. Qualifying There was very limited practice time during the week leading up to the Indy Grand Prix of Alabama. Friday's practice was cut short due to rain, while the practice on Saturday morning was canceled due to fog.http://www.indycar.com/News/2012/March/3-30-IICS-Barber-practice-day.aspx After qualifying was completed on Saturday morning, it was Hélio Castroneves who sat on the pole for the 2012 Indy Grand Prix of Alabama in the #3 AAA Insurance Chevy owned by Roger Penske. Andretti Autosport's driver James Hinchcliffe sat on the outside of the first row in the #27 GoDaddy.com car.http://www.indycar.com/News/2012/March/3-31-Barber-IICS-quals.aspx Race Scott Dixon led 38 laps and was leading on lap 66 when he made his final pit stop. A slow pit stop caused by trouble on the left rear tire, as well as traffic in the pit lane, allowed Will Power to pass him going into turn one. After all the leaders shuffled through their pit stops, Power took the lead, and held off Dixon over the final laps to win. ==Classification== Starting grid {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" !Row !colspan=2Inside !colspan=2Outside - !1  style=\\"background:mediumblue; color:white;\\" align=center width=\\"25\\"3 width=\\"175\\" Hélio Castroneves  style=\\"background:lawngreen; color:coral;\\" align=center width=\\"25\\" 27 width=\\"175\\" James Hinchcliffe - !2  style=\\"background:white; color:#CC0000;\\" align=\\"center\\"9  Scott Dixon  style=\\"background:white; color:red;\\" align=\\"center\\" 14  Mike Conway - !3  style=\\"background:black; color:white;\\" align=\\"center\\" 4  J.R.

In a career which lasted from October 2008 until December 2015 he has raced in France, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Japan and the United Arab Emirates. After racing successfully at three and four years of age he improved to become one of the world's leading racehorses as a five-year-old in 2011. His achievements were recognised when he was awarded the title of European Champion Older Horse at the Cartier Racing Awards. Cirrus des Aigles' Group One wins have included the Champion Stakes in 2011, the Dubai Sheema Classic in 2012, the Prix d'Ispahan and the Coronation Cup in 2014 and a record three wins in Prix Ganay. Other major successes have included three wins in the Prix Dollar as well as victories in the Prix du Prince d'Orange, Prix du Conseil de Paris, Grand Prix de Vichy, Prix Gontaut-Biron, Grand Prix de Deauville and La Coupe de Maisons-Laffitte. On 28 March 2016, it was announced that Cirrus Des Aigles had been retired. ==Background== Cirrus des Aigles is a bay gelding bred in France by Yvon Lelimouzin & Benoit Deschamps. He was sired by the Irish-bred stallion Even Top, a descendant of the Byerley Turk, whose most notable racecourse performance came when he was beaten a short head by Mark of Esteem in the 1996 2000 Guineas. He is best known as a sire of National Hunt horses, with Cirrus des Aigles being by far his best flat runner. Cirrus des Aigles' dam, Taille de Guepe (\\"Wasp's Waist\\") was distantly related to the notable American performers Omar Khayyam and Aloma's Ruler, but was too slow to race and was given as a present by her trainer Élie Lellouche to Lelimouzin, who supervised the Chantilly training ground known as \\"Les Aigles\\" (the Eagles). Cirrus des Aigles was sent into training with Corine Barande- Barbe at Chantilly, but proved to be almost unmanageable and was gelded in March 2008. As a gelding, Cirrus des Aigles was ineligible to compete in several important European races including the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. ==Racing career== 2008: two-year-old season Cirrus des Aigles failed to win in four appearances as a two-year-old. He finished fourth on his debut in a maiden race at Chantilly Racecourse in October, and was then placed in minor races at Maisons-Laffitte, Saint-Cloud and Deauville. 2009: three-year-old season Cirrus des Aigles ran seventeen times as a three-year-old, winning six races including the Prix du Prince d'Orange and the Prix du Conseil de Paris. He began the year by running four times on the all-weather surface at Cagnes-sur-mer Racecourse, finishing second three times and recording his first victory when winning a 1600m event in late January. He returned to the turf to win two races at Longchamp in May and was then moved up to Listed class. He was placed four times before winning the Grand Prix du Lion d'Angers at Le Lion-d'Angers Racecourse in August. In September, Cirrus des Aigles contested his first Group race. Ridden by Frank Blondel he was driven out to take the lead in the closing stages and defeated World Heritage by three quarters of a length in the Prix du Prince d'Orange over 2000m at Longchamp. A month later he won the Prix du Conseil de Paris over 2400m, taking the lead in the straight and pulling clear to win by six lengths. On his final start of the season he was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse where he finished fifth to Daryakana in the Hong Kong Vase. 2010: four-year-old season Cirrus des Aigles ran seven times as a four-year-old, winning two races including the Prix Dollar. He began the season returning to Cagnes-sur-Mer where he finished fourth in a Listed Race and was then off the racecourse for six months. Cirrus des Aigles returned with a third place behind Vision d'Etat in the Prix Gontaut-Biron and then won the Listed Prix du Boulogne at Longchamp. In October he recorded his first win at Group Two level when he won the Prix Dollar \\"comfortably\\" by two lengths from the German gelding Budai. Cirrus des Aigles again ended his year in Asia as he finished unplaced in the Japan Cup and the Hong Kong Cup. 2011: five-year-old season Cirrus des Aigles ran eleven times as a five-year-old, winning five races including La Coupe, the Grand Prix de Vichy the Prix Gontaut-Biron the Grand Prix de Deauville and the Champion Stakes. He finished placed in the Prix Exbury, the Prix Ganay, the Prix d'Ispahan (beaten a neck by Goldikova) before recording his first win of the year in La Coupe at Longchamp in June, leading from the start and beating a field which included the multiple Group One winner Stacelita. He was narrowly beaten by Sarafina in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud but then won his next three races. He started odds on favourite for the Grand Prix de Vichy in July and won comfortably, despite conceding weight to his five opponents. On 14 August he took the Prix Gontaut-Biron by eight lengths and two weeks later he added the Grand Prix de Deauville, finishing ten lengths clear of Silver Pond. Cirrus des Aigles was made favourite for a repeat win in the Prix Dollar, but after leading in the straight he was beaten a short neck by the Prince of Wales's Stakes winner Byword, to whom he was conceding four pounds. In October, Cirrus des Aigles was sent to race in Britain for the first time when he contested the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Ascot. The field for the most valuable race ever run in Britain included many leading horses including So You Think, Nathaniel, Snow Fairy, Midday and Twice Over. Ridden by Christophe Soumillon, Cirrus des Aigles raced just behind the front-runners before moving forward to challenge for the lead a furlong from the finish. In a strongly contested finish, he prevailed by three-quarters of a length from So You Think, with Snow Fairy half a length back in third. After the race Soumillon was given a five-day riding ban and lost his £50,000 share of the prize money for using his whip six times inside the furlong. He pointed out that he had been unable to see the furlong marker and claimed that the controversial rule \\"makes no sense\\". Barande-Barbe described the win as her best day in racing and said that Cirrus des Aigles \\"keeps improving, and has just run best race of his life.\\" On his final start of the season he finished fifth to California Memory in the Hong Kong Cup. At the Cartier Racing Awards, Cirrus des Aigles was named European Champion Older Horse. 2012: six-year- old season In the Dubai Sheema Classic, Cirrus des Aigles' win provided France's Corine Barande-Barbe with the first ever win by a female trainer on Dubai World Cup Night. The gelding tracked the leaders before taking the lead in the straight and holding off the late challenge of St Nicholas Abbey by a neck. On 29 April Cirrus des Aigles returned to France to contest the Prix Ganay. He started odds-on favourite and led after 100m. In the straight he pulled away from his opponents to win by eight lengths from Giofra and Reliable Man. In May, Cirrus des Aigles started the 4/5 favourite for the Prix d'Ispahan but was headed in the closing stages and beaten three quarters of a length by the filly Golden Lilac. Several weeks after the race it was revealed that Cirrus des Aigles had tested positive for a banned anti-inflammatory drug. Barande-Barbe denied any wrongdoing. A minor injury in summer took longer than expected to heal, and Cirrus des Aigles was forced to miss planned engagements in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and the International Stakes. The gelding finally reappeared for the Prix Dollar at Longchamp on 6 October. Racing on very soft ground, Cirrus des Aigles took the lead approaching the straight and drew away from his seven rivals to win \\"very easily\\" by nine lengths. Two weeks later, Cirrus des Aigles was matched against Frankel in the Champion Stakes at Ascot. The gelding made much of the running before being overtaken by Frankel in the straight. He finished one and three quarter lengths behind Frankel and two and a half lengths clear of the third placed Nathaniel. In December, Cirrus des Aigles was sent to Hong Kong to contest the Hong Kong Cup but was withdrawn from the race after sustaining an injury in training. 2013: seven-year-old season Following the retirement of Frankel, Cirrus des Aigles was the highest rated racehorse in the world in early 2013. On his first appearance of the season, he started favourite for the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud but after taking the lead in the straight he faded into fifth place behind the German colt Novellist. On 27 July, Cirrus des Aigles started 6/4 favourite for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, but was never able to challenge for the lead and finished fourth behind Novellist, Trading Leather and Hillstar. Cirrus des Aigles was dropped in class but failed to win in two races at Deauville in August. He was beaten a head by Petit Chevalier in the Group Three Prix Gontaut-Biron and then finished fifth behind Tres Blue in the Grand Prix de Deauville. On 20 September, Cirrus de Aigles recorded his first win for almost a year as led from the start to win La Coupe de Maisons-Laffitte by two and a half lengths from Vally Jem. On 5 October he became the first horse to win the Prix Dollar for the third time, winning by one and a half lengths from Mandour. Two weeks later, he was sent to England to contest his third Champion Stakes and started the 6/4 favourite in a field of ten. He made a strong challenge in the straight and finished second by a neck to Farhh, with The Derby winner Ruler of the World half a length away in third. In December he was sent to Hong Kong again and finished third behind Akeed Mofeed and Tokei Halo in the Hong Kong Cup. 2014: eight-year-old season Cirrus des Aigles began his 2014 season in a race on the Polytrack surface at Chantilly on 4 March in which he finished fourth behind Now We Can. On 29 March at Meydan Racecourse, Cirrus des Aigles started at odds of 9/1 for the Dubai Sheema Classic. He took the lead in the straight but was overtaken entering the final furlong and was beaten one and a half lengths into second place by the Japanese mare Gentildonna. On his return to Europe, Cirrus des Aigles was matched against the undefeated World Champion and Cartier Horse of the Year Treve in the Prix Ganay at Longchamp on 27 April. The gelding took the lead in the straight and fought back after being overtaken by Treve to win the race by a short neck. Four weeks later, Cirrus des Aigles started odds-on favourite for the Prix d'Ispahan and won from Anodin and Pollyanna, with the leading British colt Olympic Glory in fourth. He subsequently ran in the Coronation Cup on the Epsom Derby card on 7 June and was a comfortable winner at 10/11 SP favourite. His jockey Christophe Soumillon dismounted immediately after the winning line concerned that his mount may have gone lame, but he was pronounced fine shortly after by his trainer Mme C Barbe. Cirrus des Aigles returned to the racecourse on 4 October when he attempted to win the Prix Dollar for a fourth time. He finished first ahead of Fractional but was demoted to fifth place after a steward's enquiry. Two weeks later he contested the Champion Stakes for the fourth time and started the 7/4 favourite. Racing on heavy ground he never looked likely to win and finished fifth of the nine runners behind Noble Mission. He ended the season with another trip to Hong Kong and finished fourth behind Designs On Rome in the Hong Kong Cup on 14 December. 2015: nine-year-old season Cirrus des Aigles took some time to recover from exertions in Hong Kong and did not reappear until May, when he attempted to win the Prix Ganay for a third time. Starting at odds of 3.7/1 in a seven- runner field, he led from the start and won by one and three quarter lengths from Al Kazeem. Three weeks later he started second favourite for the Prix d'Ispahan but finished last of the four runners behind Solow after breaking a shoe in the early stages. A bruised fetlock prevented him from contesting the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and he was rested until autumn. On September 12 he started at odds of 8/1 for the Irish Champion Stakes and finished last of the seven runners behind Golden Horn. He failed to recapture his best form in three subsequent starts, finishing fifth in the Prix Dollar, fourth in the Prix Royal-Oak and tenth in the Hong Kong Vase. Following a disappointing exercise gallop in early 2016, a veterinary examination revealed \\"calcification on a sesamoid ligament\\", meaning that Cirrus des Aigles would be at risk of serious injury if he raced again. His retirement was announced on Facebook on 28 March. ==Assessment== In 2009 Cirrus des Aigles made his first appearance in the World Thoroughbred Rankings when he was given a rating of 117, placing him just outside the world's top 100. He was rated a pound higher in 2010, placing him in a tie for 95th place. In the annual ratings for 2011, Cirrus des Aigles was rated on 128, making him the third best racehorse in the world, level with Danedream and behind only Frankel and Black Caviar. He was the highest rated older male and the highest in the Intermediate distance (10 furlong/ 2000 metre) division. In 2012, Cirrus des Aigles was the second highest-rated horse in the world, nine pounds behind Frankel and a pound ahead of Black Caviar. In 2013, his rating dropped to 123, making him the 24th best racehorse in the world. ==PedigreeReferences * Career 1-2-3 Colour Chart – Cirrus des Aigles Category:2006 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in France Category:Racehorses trained in France Category:Cartier Award winners Category:Thoroughbred family 9-h Category:Byerley Turk sire line ","title":"Cirrus des Aigles"},{"id":"35285002","text":"Indian Heights is an unincorporated community located in the town of Lyndon, Juneau County, Wisconsin, United States.

It stars Kurt Russell and Richard Yniguez and is based on the University of Texas tower shooting. ==Plot== The film is based on the true story of Charles Joseph Whitman, an engineering student and former Marine who murdered his own wife and mother and then killed 14 more people and wounded 31 others in a shooting rampage at the University of Texas at Austin on the afternoon of August 1, 1966. ==Cast== *Kurt Russell as Charles Whitman *Richard Yniguez as Ramiro Martinez *Ned Beatty as Allen Crum *Pernell Roberts as Lieutenant Lee *Clifton James as Captain Fred Ambrose *John Forsythe as Lt.

He met with Robert Howard, president of NBC TV and asked if he could make a film about an actual Chicano hero. Howard agreed. Calderon pitched several stories and Howard agreed to finance The Deadly Tower as it was about a Chicano police officer, Martinez. MGM were commissioned to make the movie with Calderon as producer, Richard Caffey as executive producer and David Goldsmith as production executive. The Deadly Tower was filmed at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge, Louisiana because the University of Texas refused to allow filming there. ==Reception== The Los Angeles Times called the film \\"highly effective\\" but wondered \\"no matter how well done is there any reason to relive that bloody moment of history.\\"'Deadly Tower' at Texas U.: CECIL SMITH Death Tower on a Campus Smith, Cecil.

Martinez, the other police officer, said he sued the producers of the movie in 1975 ″because there was so much in the movie that was untruthful.″ That lawsuit was settled out of court. ==References * *The Deadly Tower at BFI *The Deadly Tower at Letterbox DVD Category:1975 television films Category:1975 films Category:Crime films based on actual events Category:1975 crime films Category:American television films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Jerry Jameson Category:Films scored by Don Ellis ","title":"The Deadly Tower"},{"id":"35285049","text":"Pavel Simr (born 6 July 1983) is a Czech footballer, who plays as a forward.

The single album was released digitally on January 26, 2012, and contains four tracks. The accompanying CD of Warrior was released on February 2, 2012, when the album sold 10,000 copies in two days upon its release. The album also debuted on Billboard's World Albums Chart at number 10. The lead single, \\"Warrior\\", was released on January 26, 2012 through various online digital stores. In March 2012, B.A.P released a follow-up single, \\"Secret Love\\". The single album peaked at number three on the Gaon Album Chart. ==Background and promotion== On January 16, 2012, TS Entertainment revealed the jacket photos of Bang Yong- guk and Jung Dae-hyun, thus revealing the latter as the fourth member. The following day, jacket photos of Zelo and Moon Jong-up were released, and revealed the latter as the fifth member. On January 19, 2012, jacket photos of Kim Him-chan and Yoo Young-jae were released, and revealed the latter as the final member. The same day, they also released the music video teaser for their debut single, \\"Warrior\\" with TS Entertainment saying that \\"it carries a powerful flavor that will help bring out a fierce performance from B.A.P.\\" TS Entertainment also announced that the title track, \\"Warrior\\", was composed by Kang Jiwon and Kim Kibum, whose previous works include Secret's \\"Magic\\", \\"Madonna\\", \\"Shy Boy\\", \\"Starlight Moonlight\\", as well as Bang & Zelo‘s \\"Never Give Up\\". The group started promoting \\"Warrior\\" on KBS's Music Bank on January 27, 2012. \\"Burn it Up\\" was used as the introduction song for their debut stage in music show programs. The group also performed all the tracks of Warrior (EP) on their debut showcase held in Seoul, South Korea which was attended by 3,000 people. In March 2012, B.A.P released a follow-up promotional single, \\"Secret Love\\". ==Critical reception== iTunes wrote \\"Short for Best Absolute Perfect, BAP is a Korean boy band, and Warrior is its debut EP. While the group's breakneck rapping and over-the-top imagery (check out the video) set it apart from the typical ballad-centric K-Pop offerings, BAP is most definitely a boy band, complete with matching dyed-blond hair and ultra-sleek production. The title track sounds like something straight out of Step Up 3D, with gigantic drums, walls of synths, and a whistle punctuating the whole song. \\"Unbreakable\\" flaunts more of an R&B; vibe, set to skittering snares and subdued claps. The real standout here is \\"Secret Love,\\" where the beats mellow out enough to actually hear the members rapping. It’s set to boom-baps, chill acoustic guitar strumming, and smooth singing from Secret's Song Ji-eun.\\" ==Chart performance== On February 2, 2012, Warrior was released on various music stores in South Korea. The single album peaked at number three on the Gaon Album Chart and peaked at number ten on the Gaon Monthly Album Chart. The album sold 10,000 copies in just two days upon its release. The album also debuted on Billboard's World Albums Chart at number 10. As of March 2012, Warrior has sold over 23,821 copies in South Korea. ==Singles== \\"Warrior\\" served as B.A.P's debut single, the first from their self-titled debut album. \\"Warrior\\" debuted at number fifty-four on the Gaon Chart and peaked at number forty-four. \\"Warrior\\" was lauded by various media outlets and netizens for its powerful and fierce imagery on its music video and live performances. The song was written and produced by Kang Ji-won and Kim Ki-bum, the same composer of Song Ji-eun's \\"Going Crazy\\" and Bang&Zelo;'s \\"Never Give Up\\". Additionally, B.A.P's leader, Bang Yong-guk, co-wrote \\"Warrior\\". Kaylin Ro of Arirang Pop's in Seouls described \\"Warrior\\" \\"as a song in a new genre that blends the elements of krump and rock with an intense hip hop beat.\\" Ro added that \\"it contains a powerful message, speaking on behalf of those who face numerous challenges in their daily lives, and the spectacular performance on stage is definitely eye-catching. The song's lyrics describes the injustice of the current society and the protagonist's desire to end it. After B.A.P ended the promotion for \\"Warrior\\", TS Entertainment announced that they will have follow-up promotional single in March with \\"Secret Love\\". The song features label mate Song Ji-eun of Secret and is written and produced by Bang Yong-guk, Kang Ji-won and Loptomist. On February 27, TS Entertainment revealed, \\"Following B.A.P’s performance of Warrior on the February 26 episode of SBS’ Inkigayo, the members will begin promotions for Secret Love later this week and shed their tough masculine image to display a new side to them.\\" The agency added, \\"We contemplated quite a lot on which track we should follow up to Warrior off B.A.P’s debut album and since we wanted to show a new side of the group we decided on Secret Love.\\" The song tells the sad love story from the perspective of a celebrity and how they have to hold secret relationships. The song served only as a promotional single with its music video being filmed with behind the scenes footage of \\"Warrior\\" and \\"Never Give Up\\".

A student pilot was accompanied by an instructor in a small space behind him, sharing the control column and with a dual rudder bar. The Doppelraab could be flown solo for later basic training. ==Design and development== Fritz Raab, who had designed gliders before World War II, recognised a postwar need for a low cost trainer aircraft. Rather than reproduce the low-performance, single-seat, open-frame primary gliders of the 1930s, he aimed for a design that could act both as a trainer and as a useful gliding club single-seater with respectable performance. Simplicity of rigging was a priority. The result was the Doppelraab, which some have described as a 1½-seater because of its rudimentary instructor's position. It is a strut-braced high-wing monoplane with a mixed metal-and-wood frame and plywood and fabric covering. The centre section of the wing has a constant chord, with a plywood-covered D-box forward of the main spar. The ply covering extends to the trailing edge at the wing roots over the triangular area defined by the internal drag strut. The outer panels continue the leading edge ply-covered D-box but incorporate curved ailerons, giving the wing an approximately elliptical planform. Where not ply- surfaced, the wing is fabric-covered. Most production aircraft have mid-chord spoilers on the inner section upper surface. Lift and landing forces are borne by faired struts from the lower fuselage to the main spar close to the end of the wing centre sections. The Doppelraab has a pod-and-boom style fuselage, though the wood-framed, ply-skinned boom is quite deep and has a triangular section. The fabric-covered, parallel chord horizontal tail, carrying separate elevators, is mounted on top of the fuselage. The fin is narrow and ply covered but mounts a broad, fabric-covered rudder which extends below the bottom of the fuselage, where a small underfin protects it and carries a small tailskid. Forward of the wing trailing edge the fuselage becomes much deeper and is metal framed, forming the cockpit. In the prototype, the student's position was conventional and provided with a windscreen of single curvature and with open sides; the instructor squeezed into a small space behind the student and sat astride a pillion seat in a kneeling position, his weight partly supported by knee pads on either side of the forward seat. He could reach over the pupil to the top of an extended control column and his feet pointed backwards to rest on a duplicate rudder bar. Later production machines retain this layout but have a completely enclosed canopy and a slightly raised, bench type instructor's seat. The early prototypes experimented with both forward monowheel and bicycle undercarriages but the production aircraft settled on a rearward placed monowheel with a long forward skid. The Doppelraab first flew on 5 August 1951. As well as the early cockpit and undercarriage, the V-0 first prototype had unusual airbrakes, formed by rotating the wing strut fairings through 90°. This system, introduced to expedite rigging, was found unsatisfactory and was abandoned in favour of spoilers. The second prototype, the V-1, initially had a two-wheel undercarriage, later altered by the replacement of the front wheel by an extended noseskid (V-1a). The V-2 and V-3 introduced the rear bench seat. The V-3 acted as the prototype for the first production version, the Doppelraab III, though only a few of them were built. The most numerous variant was the Doppelraab IV. Though detail improvements were introduced in the Doppelraab V, no major changes came before the final versions VI and VII. These had wings of 640 mm (25.2 in) greater span and correspondingly increased wing area. The empty weight of the version VI was increased by only 7 kg (15.4 b) but by flying with a higher wing loading this model could provide a 25 kg (55 lb) increase in useful load. ==Operational history== The Doppelraab appeared in public for the first time at the first postwar Wasserkuppe competition, held in 1951. It was enthusiastically received, Hanna Reitsch saying that it was \\"a dream of an aircraft\\". Its thermal soaring was judged competitive with the Grunau Baby. After a year twelve were flying with fifty in production; final production was close to four hundred. Serial production was handled by Wolf Hirth; both kits and finished aircraft were available. The forward fuselage frame was factory welded in either case. After gaining experience with his instructor, a pupil could fly the Doppelraab solo to gain his early badges, minimising the club's costs. Production licences were granted in both Americas, Africa and the Near East; one Doppelraab flew as far north as Spitsbergen. In 2010 twenty-two Doppelraabs remained on the civil aircraft registers of European countries, one in Belgium, one in the Netherlands, one in Spain and the rest in Germany. ==Variants== Data from Die berümtesten Segelflugzeuge ;Prototypes: ;V-0: First Doppelraab.

Mohamed Nazim (MSc, psc) is the former Minister of Defence and National Security of the Republic of Maldives. He first became the Defence Minister on 8 February 2012 under the presidency of Dr. Mohamed Waheed Hassan Manik.He last served as the Administrative Officer of the Integrated Headquarters of Maldives National Defence Force. He retired from active service on 15 January 2011. ==Biography== Born in Male’, Maldives, Minister graduated from Majeediya School prior to his enlistment on 11 March 1987. Upon graduation, Mohamed Nazim was called in by the government to put his compulsory service to the nation as a soldier. Unlike most of his friends who sought several excuses to evade compulsory military service, he chose to embrace the strenuous life. He is fondly named as Seeney by his friends. Seeny somewhat reflects that name of his house M. Seenu Karankaage, Male'. The knowledge and experience acquired from the Training Centre that with his charismatic leadership garnered him the trust from the helm of the organization, endorsing him to many prestigious appointments in his 23 years of dedicated service. He commanded the Quick Reaction Force 2 now inducted to the Marine Corps and the Regional Headquarters Seenu Gan now inducted to the Southern Area Command. He was also the Commanding Officer of the Maldives National Cadet Corps and the President of the Dhivehi Sifainge Club. He held the post of Deputy Commanding Officer of Maldives National Cadet Corps for 6 consecutive years. In his secondary area of expertise, disaster management, he has attended many courses and seminars and has acquired extensive knowledge and experience in the field, having formulated many contingency plans for disaster mitigation, relief and evacuation drills. He is also involved in his family business, Rasheed Carpentry, which is a construction company. He also runs H78, a small boutique hotel in the island of Hulhumale'. ==Military Career and Training== He completed all the local military trainings that a soldier would undergo in the Maldives before undergoing the advance trainings in School of Infantry and Tactic, Quetta, Pakistan and in Infantry School, Fort Benning, Georgia, USA. Minister Nazim is also a graduate of the Mubarak Al Abdullah Command and Staff College, Kuwait, earning excellence in the Master of Military Science Degree program. He also completed the United Nations Military Observer Course at Malaysian Peacekeeping Training Centre, Malaysia, International Disaster Management Course at Bournemouth University, UK, and Regional Disaster Management Course at Asian Disaster Preparedness Center, Bangkok, Thailand. Apart from attending to several workshops, seminars and conferences he is an alumna of Asia Pacific Centre for Security Studies, College of Security Studies, USA and Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, National Defense University, USA. He is also a member of Association of the United States Army, USA. ==Disaster Management Center== Minister Nazim played a vital role in the formulation of National Disaster Management Plan and Act, establishing and organizing the newly enacted Disaster Management Centre in the wake of India Ocean Tsunami 2004, coordination and execution of bilateral trainings, organizing various types of conferences and national ceremonies, organizing and executing of HOD protection, formulating the MNDF Drill Manual, and formulating various training syllabuses including the MNCC Training Syllabus, are only a few to mention. ==Family == Col ( rtd) Mohamed Nazim is married to Afaaf Abdul Majeed. He has two daughters, Aiminath Vulau and Aishath Luha, and a son, Ahmed Looth. ==Dismissal== \\"Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen has today (19th January 2015) dismissed … Col Mohamed Nazim from the post of Minister of Defense and National Security,\\" the president's office noted in a statement released on Tuesday. The statement announced a successor for the defense minister position; retired army general, Moosa Ali Jaleel, will take over the position. According to Defense News, \\"police were seen taking away unspecified documents during a raid early on Sunday\\" at the defense minister's home. Reportedly, the raid was initiated on suspicions that the defense minister was \\"harboring weapons and explosives.\\" The minister's sacking could have been related to political infighting, though this remains ambiguous. Nazim did play a major role in ousting of the small island state's first democratically elected leader, Mohamed Nasheed, in 2012. Nasheed stepped down as president after widespread protests by the opposition in which some units of the military and police force (special operations) backed the opposition demonstrators & mutinied . Nasheed claimed that he'd been ousted in a coup d’état. Mohamed Nazim, was later appointed as Minister of Defense by the Vice President of Nasheed's Government who succeeded him to Presidency. He commanded the defense force's with an iron fist. Many soldiers, including 2 brigadier generals, a colonel and many other non commissioned officers were dismissed from the military service without due trails, after they brought up concern's over mishandling of security forces during the coup d'état and after. He was best known for his role during the Male' water crisis. However, with the way how events unfolded, there were allegations that the crisis was engineered to gain popularity that is much needed to further his political ambitions. After his own dismissal, former Defense Minister Nazim, who spoke with the press, noted that the police raid against his home was entirely inappropriate and unwarranted. \\"In which country of the world do police kick down the door to a defense minister’s home and proceed to destroy all doors and conduct a raid at 3:30 am while the defense minister is asleep,\\" noted Nazim, as quoted by a local news agency. He vowed to remain involved in politics & that he would make the government accountable. Maldivian police noted that \\"lethal weapons\\" had been confiscated from the defense minister's home and that Nazim had refused to cooperate with their investigation. Under Maldivian law, it is illegal to possess any weapon. However, Mr Nazim was one of the convicts to be released under the Maldives Supreme Court Order issued on 1 February 2018. After President Ibrahim Mohamed was elected as the new President of Maldives in September 2018, the courts in Maldives have reviewed and reversed some of their own verdicts. Hence, Col.rtd. Nazim has now been released from jail and the execution of the previous verdict against him is suspended for the time being. In the meantime, he has joined the Republican Party run by business tycoon Buruma Gasim Ibrahim, who was also the then Speaker of the Maldivian Parliament. Currently, Mr Nazim is an elected member of the Parliament representing Dhangenthi constituency. After his release from prison, Col. Rtd. Nazim said that, the former President of Maldives Mr Yamin Abdul Gayoom and the former Commissioner of Police Mr Hussein Waheed were involved in framing him and putting him behind bars. He vowed to bring both of them before the court. ==References== *presidencymaldives.gov.mv *presstv.ir Category:Maldivian military personnel Category:Living people Category:People from Malé Category:Government ministers of the Maldives Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Mohamed Nazim"},{"id":"35285165","text":"is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent.

Vern L. Bullough wrote that Brooke was \\"one of the true beauties to grace the porn screen.\\" ==Early life and career== Brooke was born in Chicago, Illinois, the daughter of Mary Lee and Edward Stephen Mendum, and she had a brother named Edward. Brooke began her career in theater and played in the original production of Hair in the roles of \\"Sheila\\" and \\"Jeannie\\". Additional roles she played onstage include \\"Linda\\" in Flower Drum Song and \\"Rusty\\", the wife of the late comedian Lenny Bruce, in Lenny. A December 1972 edition of Gallery said of her performance in Lenny that: \\"...Mendum displayed a charm throughout the performance that makes another heavy credit for her career most-deserved. [...] We think you will understand our impulse to revive that delightful old custom of flowers in the dressing room and waiting at the backstage door.\\" It was also during her stage career that she worked at the Playboy Club in Chicago, where Brooke became friends with Hugh Hefner. ==Film career== She made her film debut in 1973 with the softcore pornographic film Grace's Place, directed by Chuck Vincent. She was also an adult magazine model who posed for such magazines as Playboy and Gallery. Her best-known role was \\"Anne\\" in the 1975 S&M; drama The Image, directed by Radley Metzger, who reportedly was her boyfriend at the time. In the movie, there are explicit scenes of fellatio and urination; however, Brooke did not perform sexual intercourse on camera. She performed full hardcore sex in the French movie Les Milles et une perversions de Felicia (The Thousand and One Perversions of Felicia), including fellatio and sexual intercourse in 1975. Brooke also appeared in softcore pornographic films directed by Joe Sarno, including Abigail Lesley is Back in Town (1975), Laura's Toys (1975), and Confessions of a Young American Housewife (1974).

Later, she, with her husband at the time, owned a restaurant in Memphis, Tennessee. However, Brooke lost this restaurant after a divorce. Pornographic actor Jamie Gillis (in a DVD interview) has said that Brooke converted to Islam shortly after retiring. In the last few years of her life, Brooke lived alone in Boca Raton, Florida. ==Death== Although there are rumors that she is still alive and that she may have even faked her death, Brooke died of an accidental drowning due to a fall on July 17, 2012 in Boca Raton, Florida. With respect to her wishes, there were neither announcements nor services of her death. ==References* Category:1952 births Category:American pornographic film actresses Category:Actresses from Chicago Category:Pornographic film actors from Illinois Category:2012 deaths ","title":"Rebecca Brooke"},{"id":"35285276","text":"Promotone BV is a company of the English rock band The Rolling Stones which owns their recordings.

That police official was identified as Deputy Inspector Anthony Bologna. After an investigation, Deputy Inspector Bologna, who makes an annual salary of $154,000, was transferred to a different station, and lost two weeks vacation time over the incident. Public attention to the pepper-sprayings resulted in a spike of news media coverage, a pattern that was to be repeated in the coming weeks following confrontations with police. Clyde Haberman described the resultant public attention as a \\"big boost\\" that was \\"vital\\" for the still nascent Occupy movement.Overtime, Solidarity and Complaints in Wall St. Protests.

A video by protesters shows the explosion of what appears to be a flash-bang device thrown by one officer near protesters attempting to aid Olsen. The Associated Press later reported that it was not known exactly what kind of object had struck Olsen or who had thrown or fired it, but that protesters had been throwing rocks and bottles. Olsen was rushed to the hospital by other protesters, who were fired upon with unknown police projectiles while attempting to aid him. Doctors said that he was in critical condition. Scott Olsen has since undergone brain surgery. At least two other protesters were injured. No officers have been disciplined over the incident.

Video footage of the afternoon confrontation shows police using batons and dragging two protesters by the hair, one of whom was UC Berkeley English professor Celeste Langan. 39 protesters, including Professor Langan, were arrested for charges including \\"resisting and delaying a police officer in the performance of their duties and failure to disperse when given a dispersal order.\\" Robert Hass, a UC Berkeley professor of poetry and former United States Poet Laureate, wrote about the police response in a November 19 New York Times opinion piece entitled \\"Poet-Bashing Police\\": > the deputies in the cordon surged forward and, using their clubs as > battering rams, began to hammer at the bodies of the line of students.

She is noted for inventing a technique to make the local pottery type, barro negro, black and shiny after firing. This created new markets for the ceramics with collectors and tourists. The origins of barro negro pottery extend over centuries, with examples of it found at a number of Mexican archeological sites, fashioned mostly into jars and other utilitarian items. It has remained a traditional craft of the Zapotecs and Mixtecs of the Central Valleys area to the present day. Originally all barro negro pottery was matte and grayish due to the qualities of the clay and the firing process. In this form, the pottery is very sturdy, allowing it to be hit without breaking. The barro negro pottery of Doña Rosa’s hometown of San Bartolo has been traditionally used to make large “cántaros”, tall vessels used for storing and transporting liquids, including mezcal. In the 1950s, Doña Rosa discovered that she could change the color and shine of the pieces by making some changes to how the clay piece is handled. Just before the formed clay piece is completely dry, it is polished with a quartz stone to compress the surface. It is then fired at a slightly lower temperature than traditional pieces. After firing, the piece emerges a shiny black instead of a dull gray. This innovation makes the pieces more breakable, but it has made the pottery far more popular with Mexican folk art collectors, which included Nelson Rockefeller, who promoted it in the United States. The popularity stems from the look, rather than durability, so many pieces such as containers, whistles, flutes, bells, masks, lamps and animal figures are produced now for decorative purposes rather than utilitarian. Doña Rosa died in 1980, but the tradition of making the barro negro pottery is being carried on by Doña Rosa’s daughter and grandchildren who stage demonstrations for tourists.Pg 744 - - Total pages: 1056 The workshop is still in the family home, where shelves and shelves of shiny black pieces for sale line the inner courtyard. Despite being the origin of black polished clay, the pieces at the Doña Rosa Workshop are less expensive than in other parts of Mexico. ==References== Category:Mexican potters Category:Mexican ceramists Category:1980 deaths Category:Year of birth missing Category:Women potters Category:Mexican women ceramists ","title":"Doña Rosa"},{"id":"35285322","text":"Rolando Sarabia Oquendo (born 18 August 1982) is a Cuban-born American ballet dancer.

The cognitive behavioral treatment of eating disorders emphasizes on the minimization of negative thoughts about body image and the act of eating, and attempts to alter negative and harmful behaviors that are involved in and perpetuate eating disorders. It also encourages the ability to tolerate negative thoughts and feelings as well as the ability to think about food and body perception in a multi-dimensional way. The emphasis is not only placed on altering cognition, but also on tangible practices like making goals and being rewarded for meeting those goals. CBT is a “time-limited and focused approach” which means that it is important for the patients of this type of therapy to have particular issues that they want to address when they begin treatment. CBT has also proven to be one of the most effective treatments for eating disorders. ==CBT-Enhanced== A common form of CBT that is used to treat eating disorders is called CBT-Enhanced (CBT-E) and was developed by Christopher G. Fairburn throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Originally intended for bulimia nervosa specifically, it was eventually extended to all eating disorders. Within Fairburn’s enhanced CBT is CBT-Ef, designed to deal particularly with eating habits, and CBT-Eb for other issues that do not directly involve eating. A study which compared two different types of cognitive-behavioral treatments for the patients suffering from eating disorders was conducted. Out of the two targeted treatment approaches, one solely focused on eating disorder features and the other one which was a more complex form of treatment also addressed mood intolerance, clinical perfectionism, low self-esteem and interpersonal difficulties. This study was done involving 154 patients who suffered DSM-IV eating disorders. This involved 20 weeks of treatment and 60 weeks period of closed follow up and the outcomes were measured by independent assessors who had no ideas about the treatment conditions. As a result, the patients with control conditions exhibited little change in symptom severity whereas the ones in two treatment conditions exhibited substantial and equivalent change which was even maintained during the follow-up weeks. The eating disorder diagnoses did not affect the treatment. Patients who suffered marked mood intolerance, clinical perfectionism, low self esteem or interpersonal difficulties appeared to respond better to the more complex form of treatment and the remaining patients showed a reverse pattern. As a conclusion, these two were considered to be the most suitable forms of treatment for the patients with eating disorders. The first one is viewed as the most default version of treatment and the second one is reserved for patients with marked additional psychopathology of the type targeted by the treatment. There have been numerous researches done to compare the effectiveness of Cognitive- behavioral therapy over the Interpersonal psychotherapy. These researches conclude that Cognitive-behavioral therapy is more effective in treating eating disorders as compared to Interpersonal psychotherapy. One study also showed that Interpersonal psychotherapy may be as effective as Cognitive- behavioral therapy, however the interpersonal psychotherapy may be slower to reach its effects. CBT is notably more fast and rapid in generating improvement symptoms in patients with Bulimia nervosa, Anorexia nervosa and Binge eating disorder as compared to interpersonal psychotherapy. Therefore, CBT should be considered for treating eating disorders over interpersonal psychotherapy. The results of the study are evident that cognitive-behavioral therapy is significantly faster than IPT in ameliorating the primary symptoms of bulimia nervosa. Per this study, Cognitive-behavioral therapy is more effective than interpersonal psychotherapy in modifying the disturbed attitudes to shape and weight, extreme attempts to diet, and self-induced vomiting. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is also more effective than behavior therapy in modifying the disturbed attitudes to shape and weight and extreme dieting, but it was equivalent in other respects. The findings suggest that cognitive behavior therapy, when applied to patients with bulimia nervosa, operates through mechanisms specific to this treatment and is more effective than both interpersonal psychotherapy and a simplified behavioral version of cognitive behavior therapy. ==Bulimia nervosa== A study conducted by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has found that CBT is the best treatment for bulimia nervosa. Enhanced CBT is delivered on an individual basis and usually in an outpatient situation and is meant to help with the psychopathology of the eating disorder rather than the diagnosis itself. Research demonstrates that antidepressants may be an effective alternative to CBT for treatment of eating disorders; however, CBT continues to prove more effective than antidepressants specifically for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. A small study on patients with bulimia combined CBT with text-messaging a therapist about the frequency of binge-purge behaviours and the strength of the patient's desires to binge and purge. The number of binge eating and purging episodes decreased significantly from base-line to post- treatment and followup. ==Anorexia nervosa== Less research has been conducted on the effectiveness of CBT for those with anorexia nervosa, but a recent study demonstrated that CBT was effective for 60% of the subjects tested – 60% of those for whom CBT was effective were improved upon receiving the treatment. In addition, the US National Guideline Clearinghouse reported that CBT can alleviate symptoms of depression and compulsivity that are associated with anorexia nervosa. With 40% of adults and 60% of adolescents attaining and retaining a normal body weight, CBT treatment has proved to be more workable and favorable treatment for the individuals suffering from Anorexia Nervosa. Patients reach and maintain minimum remaining psychopathological symptoms, in cases of over half the adults and about 80% of adolescents patients. Adolescents can more effectively and rapidly regain weight in comparisons with the adults. Therefore, they have better chances to get efficiently treated from these short term treatment programs. Consequently, the adolescents suffering from eating disorders are recommended to take CBT-E as one of the evidence-based psychological interventions, by the NHS England “The Access and Waiting Time Standard for Children and Young People with an Eating Disorder”. ==Binge-eating disorder== The same type of CBT used for bulimia nervosa has demonstrated that it can be helpful in the treatment of binge-eating disorder. However, one of the problems with administering CBT to those suffering from this disorder is that it does not traditionally encourage weight loss. This can be problematic for binge-eaters who are overweight or obese. As a result of issues like these CBT has not yet been established as the most effective treatment for binge-eating disorder. A commonly used alternative is behavioral weight loss because it prioritizes physical health by maintaining a healthy weight. The CBT representation model includes altering eating routines, which includes retaining and maintaining eating timetable along with weekly recording the weighing sessions. During tempting and triggering circumstances, the CBT patients are encouraged to look for substitutes and include reasonable behaviors instead of binge eating. They master some exercises which help them understand the relationship of their moods to their cravings for food. This also assists them in seeing weight in a healthy way. CBT also aims at relapse prevention besides strengthening patient’s relationships with their family and peers. The treatment duration depends on the relapse rates as well as the patient’s response to the treatment. Many studies on binge eating target the adult population considering that binge eating disorders begin in early or late adulthood. While specific evidences of an adolescent with BED are not available, nevertheless, there are some studies that talk in favor of the efficacy of CBT for binge eating disorders providing significant evidences in the cases of adult population. However, early interventions may be beneficial for the adolescents in terms of targeting exclusively the issues with self- esteem as well as the overvaluation of shape and weight of the body. Some studies conclude that to bring down the binge eating practices, aiming at weight loss may be advantageous. Weight maintenance, healthy eating as well as exercising to primarily lose weight, may eventually decrease the binge eating behaviors. It is important to not to see a treatment for a psychopathological disorders as a weight-loss program, even though weight loss and decrease in binge eating episodes may happen simultaneously. ==Other eating disorders== Eating disorders not otherwise specified (NOS) have been given less attention than anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa which are given their own categories in the DSM-IV-TR. That said, a recent study has shown that CBT is just as effective for treating eating disorders NOS as it is for bulimia nervosa. ==References== Category:Cognitive behavioral therapy Category:Eating disorders ","title":"Cognitive behavioral treatment of eating disorders"},{"id":"35285546","text":"Giovanni Battista Colomba (born 1638) was an Italian painter and architect of the Baroque period.

A predominantly riverine force since Laos is a land-locked country, the ANL River Flotilla was provided at the time with nineteen U.S.-built river patrol boats.http://www.navypedia.org/ships/laos/lao_cf.htm The new Laotian Navy was originally trained and staffed by French Officers and senior Petty Officers seconded from the naval forces component of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps (CEFEO), although a small number of selected Laotian naval officer candidate students (French: Eléves Officiers de Marine – EOMs) were also sent to France, in order to attend advanced Officer and Petty Officer courses at the French Naval Academy in Brest.Sananikone, The Royal Lao Army and U.S. Army advice and support (1981), p. 18. In July 1959 the ANL River Flotilla was re-designated Laotian Navy and became an independent branch, now part of the newly created Laotian Armed Forces (French: Forces Armées Laotiènnes – FAL), renamed Royal Lao Armed Forces (French: Forces Armées du Royaume – FAR) in September 1961.Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954-1975 (1994), pp. 5-7; 13. The MRL in the Laotian civil war 1960-1975 Like the ANL, the fledgling Laotian Navy soon found itself involved in the political turmoil that engulfed the Kingdom of Laos in the early 1960s. During Major general Phoumi Nosavan November 1960 counter-coup against Captain Kong Le's rebel Neutralist airborne units, four pro-Neutralist Laotian Navy river gunboats blocked the Mekong River at Ban Sot in an effort to halt the advance northwards from Savannakhet of Maj. Gen. Nosavan's rebel troops towards Vientiane. Other Laotian Naval units however, supported the coup by transporting up the Mekong in landing crafts from Savannakhet Lieutenant colonel Siho Lamphouthacoul and his Directorate of National Coordination (DNC) elite para-commando regiment, the 1st Special Mobile Group (French: Groupement Mobile Speciale 1 – GMS 1), on 21 November to join the Battle of Vientiane.Conboy and Morrison, Shadow War: The CIA's Secret War in Laos (1995), p. 37. ==Structure== The MRL, along with the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) and the Royal Lao Army (RLA), was placed under the control of the Ministry of Defence in Vientiane; its administrative headquarters was allocated at Vientiane's military harbour, whose facilities also housed the main repair yard, the Fleet Command and the Independent Directorate of Laotian River Transports (French: Régie Autonome des Transports Fluviaux du Laos – RATFL), which handled military logistics and monotorized commercial shipping along the Mekong river. Fleet organization By April 1975 Royal Lao Navy strength peaked at 500 Ratings and enlisted men led by Commander Tiao Sinthanavong Kindavong,Sananikone, The Royal Lao Army and U.S. Army advice and support (1981), p. 172, Chart 6. who manned a single river flotilla totalling 42 light vessels, divided since the mid-1950s into a patrol squadron (French: Escadrille Fluviale du Haut Mekong – EFHM) and a squadron-sized transport section (French: Séction de Transports Fluviaux du Laos – STFL). Throughout its existence, the MRL received technical and training assistance mainly from France, Thailand and the United States, with the latter country providing river patrol boats and transportation craft to equip their patrol and transport squadrons respectively. Most of the Laotian Navy river assets were stationed permanently at Vientiane Naval Base, with secondary riverine stations set along the Mekong at Luang Prabang, Pak Lay, Thakhek, Savannakhet, Paksé and Khong Island. Besides its tiny surface fleet, the MRL was also unique in its genre for not maintaining a permanent Naval Infantry branch or even specialist combat diver/Marine Commando units. ==List of Laotian Navy commanders== *Commander Tiao Sinthanavong Kindavong (? - 1975) ==Equipment== Escort and combat patrol craft *Six Cabin-type patrol boatshttp://www.navypedia.org/ships/laos/lao_cf_cabin.htm *Two Chris-Craft patrol boatshttp://www.navypedia.org/ships/laos/lao_cf_chris_craft.htm *Twelve 11m patrol boatshttp://www.navypedia.org/ships/laos/lao_cf_11m.htm *Twenty PBR Mk 1 and 2 \\"Bibber\\" patrol boats Troop transport, amphibious assault, and logistical operations craft *Sixteen LCM-8 Landing Craft Utility (LCU) ==MRL uniforms and insignia== The Laotian Navy owed its origin and traditions to the French Far East Naval Forces (French: Forces Maritimes en Extrême- Orient – FMEO) of the First Indochina War, and even after the United States took the role as the main foreign sponsor for the Royal Laotian Armed Forces at the beginning of the 1960s, French military influence was still perceptible in their uniforms and insignia. Service dress and field uniforms Upon its formation at the mid-1950s, most Laotian Navy personnel received the standard French Navy's tropical working and service dress, consisting of a light khaki cotton shirt and pants. The French Navy's M1948 shirt (French: Chemise kaki clair Mle 1948) featured a six-buttoned front and two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps, was provided with shoulder straps (French: Epaulettes) and had long sleeves with buttoned cuffs. It was worn with matching khaki M1945/52 slacks (French: Pantalon kaki clair Mle 1945/52), which featured two pleats at the front hips, side slashed pockets and an internal pocket at the back, on the right side. The French Army's tropical light khaki cotton shirt and pants (French: Tenue de toile kaki clair Mle 1945), modelled after the WWII US Army tropical \\"Chino\\" working dress was also issued. While the cut of the matching khaki trousers was virtually identical to the Navy pattern, the shirt had two patch breast pockets closed by clip- cornered straight flaps and shoulder straps. In alternative, the short-sleeved M1946 (French: Chemisette kaki clair Mle 1946) – whose cut was almost identical to the M1948 variant – and the \\"Chino\\"-style M1949 (French: Chemisette kaki clair Mle 1949) khaki shirts could be worn with the matching M1946 khaki shorts (French: Culotte courte kaki clair Mle 1946) in hot weather. Reflecting the increasing American influence, a new set of distinctive uniforms was introduced for the MRL in the early 1960s. Laotian naval senior officers and petty officers adopted a Navy Blue overseas service uniform, which consisted of a double-breasted reefer jacket (French: Vareuse) with open collar and lapels, and featuring two internal skirt pockets with external flaps. The jacket had a double row of six gilt metal buttons bearing the Royal Lao Armed Forces (FAR) wreathed \\"Vishnu\\" trident, and was worn with a white shirt and black tie, completed with matching blue trousers. Enlisted personnel also received a Navy Blue service uniform, consisting of a Navy jumper (or pullover shirt) and trousers flared as \\"bell bottoms\\"; the jumper was worn with a black silk neckerchief rolled diagonally under the collar, with the ends tied in a square knot in the center of the chest. For formal occasions, Laotian Navy officers retained the earlier ANL white summer cotton full dress, which consisted of a French-style eight-buttoned tunic with a standing collar and two built-in side pockets closed by straight flaps, worn with matching white slacks. The tunic's front fly was secured by gilt metal buttons initially bearing the ANL Airavata crest, replaced after 1959-60 by a FAR wreathed \\"Vishnu\\" trident motif.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75 (1989), p. 40, Plate B3. On active service, Laotian Navy sailors and Ratings initially wore French all-arms M1947 drab green fatigues (French: Treillis de combat Mle 1947)Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954–1975 (1994), p. 6. but in the 1960s and early 1970s, MRL personnel began to wear US-supplied OG 107 jungle fatigues. Thai and South Vietnamese versions, as well as Laotian-made copies were also worn. All these variants of the OG-107 fatigues often featured modifications to the original design such as shirts with shoulder straps and pockets closed by dual-buttoned straight flaps or pen pockets added on the left sleeve above the elbow, an affection common to all Laotian, South Vietnamese and Cambodian military officers, and additional side \\"cargo\\" pockets on the trousers. Olive green US M-1951 field jackets were also issued to all-ranks. Headgear Royal Lao Armed Forces cap badge 1961-75 Laotian Navy Officers and Petty Officers initially received a service peaked cap copied after the French M1927 pattern (French: Casquette d'officier Mle 1927) in both light khaki and white summer top versions with a black lacquered leather peak and gold cord chinstrap, to wear with the khaki working dress and the white high-collared full dress uniforms, respectively, and later with the Navy Blue overseas service uniform. The peaked caps were worn with the standard gilt metal ANL cap device, a wreathed Airavata crest bearing the Laotian Royal Arms – a three-headed white elephant standing on a pedestal and surmounted by a pointed parasol – set on a black teardrop-shaped background patch. After September 1961, the MRL replaced the old ANL crest with the standard gilt metal FAR wreathed \\"Vishnu\\" trident cap badge. French M1946 and M1957 light khaki sidecaps (French: Bonnet de police de toile kaki clair Mle 1946 and Bonnet de police de toile kaki clair Mle 1957) were also worn by all- ranks. An American-style \\"Dixie cup\\" white hat was worn with the Navy Blue service uniform by enlisted ranks. Laotian Navy personnel frequently wore in the field a mixture of French M1946 \\"Gourka\\" light khaki tropical berets (French: Bérét de toile kaki clair Mle 1946), baseball cap-style khaki cotton field caps,Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954–1975 (1994), p. 6. and French M1949 bush hats () in Khaki or OG cotton cloth. During the 1960s and early 1970s, a wide range of OG \\"Boonie hats\\" and baseball caps from the US, South Vietnam and Thailand were adopted by MRL officers and enlisted men. The steel helmet models worn by Laotian Navy vessel crews in the mid-1950s were the WWII-vintage US M-1 or the newer French M1951 NATO (French: Casque Mle 1951 OTAN) models, standard issue in the ANL. In the later 1960s, the MRL standardized on the M-1 1964 model provided with the US Army Mitchell \\"Clouds\\" camouflage pattern cover (usually removed on the field), though many boat crewmen retained the older US and French steel helmets throughout the war. Footwear Brown low laced leather shoes were prescribed to wear with the Laotian Navy khaki service/work uniform for all-ranks and white ones with the earlier ANL white cotton full dress for formal occasions, whilst black shoes were worn with the MRL Navy Blue overseas service uniforms. On the field, Laotian seamen initially wore brown leather US M-1943 Combat Service Boots, French M1953 brown leather \\"Rangers\\" (French: Rangers modéle 1953) and French M1917 brown leather hobnailed ankle boots (French: Brodequins modéle 1917), or French canvas-and-rubber Pataugas tropical boots,Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954–1975 (1994), p. 6. and sandals while in garrison; after 1960, the MRL adopted as regulation footwear black leather combat boots – the early US Army M-1962 \\"McNamara\\" model and the later M-1967, together with limited quantities of US Jungle boots, and local copies of the South Vietnamese Bata tropical boots.Conboy and McCouaig, The War in Laos 1960-75 (1989), p. 19.Conboy and Greer, War in Laos 1954–1975 (1994), p. 12. Navy ranks Initially, the Laotian Navy wore the same rank insignia as their French and ANL counterparts, whose sequence followed closely the French Navy pattern defined by the 1956 regulations.Gaujac, Officiers et soldats de l'armée française d'après le TTA 148 (1943-1956) (2011), pp. 38-45. Junior officers (French: Officiers supérieurs et officiers subalternes) and petty officers' (French: Officiers mariniers) ranks were worn on black removable shoulder boards (French: pattes d'épaule) or shoulder strap slides (French: passants d'épaule) similar to the Army pattern, with the addition of a fouled anchor on the inner end. NCOs and enlisted men (French: Quartier-maîtres et matelots) wore metal or cloth chevrons on both upper sleeves or pinned to the chest. In 1959 the Royal Lao Army (RLA) adopted a new distinctively Laotian-designed system of military ranks, which became in September 1961 the standard rank chart for all branches of service of the newly created Royal Lao Armed Forces. Under the new regulations, MRL officers were now entitled to wear on their service or dress uniforms stiffened red shoulder boards edged with gold braid identical to the standard RLA pattern. Junior officers added an appropriate number of five- pointed gold stars to their boards whilst petty officers' wore chevrons on the upper sleeve or diagonal bars on the lower sleeve. Enlisted men wore no insignia.

The monastery is an autonomous diocesan priory of the Benedictine Monks of Perpetual Adoration. Mark Daniel Kirby (b. 1952) is the founder and until his resignation in 2020, the superior. Following a diocesan visitation in 2020, the Priory was placed under the administration of Brendan Coffey, Abbot of Glenstal Abbey, the Republic of Ireland's only other male Benedictine monastery. ==History== The community's history began in Oklahoma in 2007, when Bishop Edward James Slattery of the Diocese of Tulsa invited Mark Daniel Kirby, then a Cistercian monk, to form a monastery with the mission of prayer for priests. In 2009, a year designated by Pope Benedict XVI as a \\"year of the priest\\", the bishop inaugurated the community under the title Monastery of Our Lady of the Cenacle. In 2011, flooding in Tulsa made the community's residence uninhabitable, and Fr. Kirby obtained Bishop Slattery's permission to move the community. In autumn 2011 the monks were invited by Bishop Michael Smith to relocate to the Diocese of Meath. In March 2012, the community moved into a former religious house in the village of Stamullen in County Meath. Based on a local geographical name, they adopted the name Silverstream Priory for the monastery. In February 2017, the community reached a milestone with the formal approval of its constitutions by the Holy See, leading to the canonical establishment of the Benedictine Monks of Perpetual Adoration as a monastic institute of consecrated life in the diocese of Meath. This made Silverstream Priory the first new monastery in the county since the abolition of monasteries under Henry VIII in 1536. ==2020 Diocesan Visitation== On May 2, 2020, Thomas Deenihan, Bishop of Meath, ordered a diocesan visitation of the Priory. News of the visitation was broken in September 2020 by the U.S.-based National Catholic Reporter, and again in October 2020 by the UK Catholic weekly The Tablet. A physical visitation of the monastery took place June 9-12, 2020. It was carried out on behalf of Bishop Deenihan by Abbot Brendan Coffey of Glenstal (current administrator of Silverstream Priory), Abbot Richard Purcell OSCO of Mount Mellaray Abbey, and Monsignor Gearoid Dullea of the Diocese of Cork and Ross. The canonical state of visitation remains open, as of October 8, 2020, according to The Tablet. ==Life== The monastery describes its historical inspiration in these terms: : Silverstream Priory is a providential realisation of the cherished project of Abbot Celestino Maria Colombo, O.S.B. (1874–1935), who, following the impetus given by Catherine–Mectilde de Bar in the 17th century, sought to establish a house of Benedictine monks committed to ceaseless prayer before the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar in a spirit of reparation. The monastery hence places a special emphasis on Eucharistic Adoration for the sanctification of Catholic priests. The monks celebrate the traditional Benedictine liturgy (Divine Office and the Mass) in the pre-Vatican II form, in Latin and with Gregorian chant. As of 2020, the monastery has 15 members, of whom three are priests. Of the monks, ten are professed members, while five are novices. ==Priory buildings== The priory house was originally built in 1843 by the Preston family (the Viscounts Gormanston), and from 1941 to 1955 was inhabited by the Brothers Hospitallers of Saint John of God, who added a church in 1952 named in honor of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux. Contemplative nuns of the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary resided at the house from 1955 to 2010. In 2018 the former church was converted into a wing for the priory's novitiate. ==See also== *List of abbeys and priories in Ireland ==References *Official website *Dom Mark Kirby's weblog Vultus Christi Category:2012 establishments in Ireland Category:Roman Catholic churches in County Meath Category:Benedictine monasteries in the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Silverstream Priory"},{"id":"35285809","text":"Ronald Zothanzama (born 4 May 1992) is an Indian footballer who plays as a defender for Aizawl in the I-League. ==Career== Shillong Lajong Ronald made his professional and I-League debut for Shillong Lajong on 24 March 2012 against Chirag United Club Kerala in which Shillong lost 2–3. ==Career statistics== Club Statistics accurate as of 31 March 2012 {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"3\\"Cup !colspan=\\"3\\"AFC !colspan=\\"3\\"Total - !Apps !Goals !Assists !Apps !Goals !Assists !Apps !Goals !Assists !Apps !Goals !Assists -  rowspan=\\"1\\" Shillong Lajong 2011-12 100000———100 - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Career total !1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!0 } ==References== Category:Indian footballers Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:I-League players Category:Footballers from Mizoram Category:Association football defenders Category:Shillong Lajong F.C. players ","title":"Ronald Zothanzama"},{"id":"35285837","text":"The Essential Kris Kristofferson is a 37-track, 2-CD compilation and career retrospective for Kris Kristofferson.

J.\\" Sorrentine (born July 29, 1982) an American former basketball player and current associate head coach of Brown University. Sorrentine is widely known from his collegiate playing career at Vermont, hitting a three-pointer with 1:10 remaining to help the 13-seed Catamounts defeat fourth-seeded Syracuse 60–57 in overtime in the first round of the 2005 NCAA Tournament for the school's first-ever tournament win. ==Playing career== Sorrentine starred for St. Raphael Academy under his father, Thomas \\"Saar\\" Sorrentine, a legendary Rhode Island high school coach and New England Basketball Hall of Fame inductee. Sorrentine was named the Rhode Island Player of the Year by both Gatorade and USA Today in 2000, after leading St. Raphael's to back-to-back state titles. When Sorrentine arrived at Vermont to play for Tom Brennan for the 2000-01 season, he made an immediate impact, leading the team in assists, and finishing second on the team in scoring, earning America East Rookie of the Year honors in the process. A year later in 2002, Sorrentine, along with Taylor Coppenrath and the late Trevor Gaines, helped guide UVM to its first-ever 20-win season and first America East Regular Season title in the process. Sorrentine scored 18.8 points per game and dished out four assists per game to win America East Player of the Year honors, the first Catamount to do so since the 1991-92 season. Sorrentine also earned AP All-American Honorable Mention honors, as well. With expectations at an all-time high in Burlington for the 2002-03 season, Sorrentine broke both his wrists before the start of the season, and sat out the entire season as a redshirt. Still, in Sorrentine's absence, the Catamounts went 21-12, winning their first-ever America East Championship, defeating Boston University for a trip to the 2003 NCAA Tournament. Returning from injury a year later, the tandem of Sorrentine and Coppenrath combined to bring Vermont to a 22-9 record, another America East Championship, and a trip to the 2004 NCAA Tournament, where the Catamounts fell to eventual national champion Connecticut in the first round. In 2004-05, Sorrentine helped Vermont to its most historic season in school history, as he along with Coppenrath and three other seniors helped Vermont post a school-record 25 wins, winning the America East regular season and conference titles for its third-straight NCAA appearance, just the third team in America East history to win three or more consecutive conference tournament titles. As a 13-seed, the Catamounts drew Big East Champion Syracuse in the 2005 NCAA Tournament in the Worcester region. Sorrentine scored 17 points, including five three-point field goals, one which will remain entrenched in NCAA Tournament lore, as Sorrentine nailed a deep three-pointer with 1:10 left in overtime to put Vermont ahead 59-55 in a 60-57 win. During the game, television commentator Gus Johnson commented that \\"Sorrentine hit that one from the parking lot.\\" The win over the Orange was the first postseason win in school history and UVM's first-ever over a ranked foe (Syracuse was ranked No. 11). Vermont eventually fell to Michigan State in the second round. After graduation, Sorrentine earned NBA Summer League spots with the Miami Heat and the Milwaukee Bucks, before signing with Banca Nuova Trapani in Italy. In that same season, Sorrentine returned stateside to suit up for the Florida Flame of the NBA Development League for the remainder of the 2005-06 season. In 2006-07, Sorrentine returned to Europe, this time to Portugal, spending the season with F.C. Porto. In his final season of professional basketball, Sorrentine spent a season in Slovenia with BC Krka, before his career was halted due to injury. On October 26, 2019, Sorrentine’s number 11 jersey was retired by the University of Vermont, on the same night former teammate Taylor Coppenrath’s number 22 was also retired. ==Coaching career== In 2008, Sorrentine accepted a spot on Brown's staff, reuniting with Jesse Agel, his former assistant coach at Vermont. In 2011, Sorrentine was promoted to associate head coach, and a year later was named the interim head coach of the Bears after Agel was fired and a search for a new coach was conducted. Sorrentine is expected to stay on staff for the Bears under new head coach Mike Martin. ==References *NBA D-League profile Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate basketball people in Italy Category:American expatriate basketball people in Portugal Category:American expatriate basketball people in Slovenia Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players from Rhode Island Category:Brown Bears men's basketball coaches Category:FC Porto basketball players Category:Florida Flame players Category:KK Krka players Category:Pallacanestro Trapani players Category:Point guards Category:Sportspeople from Pawtucket, Rhode Island Category:Vermont Catamounts men's basketball players ","title":"T.

The family settled in Brandbergen, near Stockholm. As a youth player he spent time with Hammarby IF, FOC Farsta and Enskede IK before eventually playing first team football with Brandbergens IF. Brandbergens IF were playing in the ninth tier of Swedish football at the time but would make a quick rise to the fifth tier during Dibba's years with the club. At the start of 2011 Dibba trialed with Hammarby IF feeder club Hammarby Talang FF. They were interested in signing him but didn't have room in their squad at the time. Dibba instead remained at Brandbergen for the first half of the season and then trialed with Superettan side GIF Sundsvall during the summer, where he was eventually signed to a 3.5 year deal. GIF Sundsvall He soon established himself as a frequent starter in Sundsvall. Between 2011 and 2016 he would make 132 appearances for the yo-yo club in both Allsvenskan and Superettan, scoring 34 competitive goals. On the 19 November 2014 Pa signed a new contact with GIF Sundsvall lasting until 2016. With only six months left of this contract, Dibba attracted the attention from fellow Allsvenskan team Hammarby IF during the 2016 midseason. He completed a transfer to the Stockholm-based club, where he previously had been on trial, on 8 August 2016. Hammarby IF He made his debut for Hammarby a week later in an away fixture against Sundsvall, the team he just had left. The appearance sparked some controversy as the Sundsvall staff claimed the two clubs had reached a spoken \\"gentlemen's agreement\\" that Dibba would not feature in this particular game. However, the deal was later denied by officials from Hammarby in a statement on their website. On 26 September 2016, Dibba scored his first goal in Allsvenskan for Hammarby against Falkenbergs FF on away turf in a 2-0 win. On 17 April 2017, Dibba scored the decisive goal as Hammarby won against fierce rivals AIK. He settled the score at 2-1 in the later stages of the game, citing \\"it had been a dream to determine a derby\\". Dibba had his major breakthrough in 2018, scoring 7 goals in 10 matches, as Hammarby was placed first in the league mid- season. He was voted \\"Allsvenskan Player of the Month\\" in May. Shenzhen FC On 28 June 2018, Dibba joined Chinese club Shenzhen F.C.. He signed a three-year contract with the China League One club, as reports suggested a transfer fee of around 12 million Swedish kronor (approximately £1 million). Shanghai Shenxin In February 2019, Dibba was loaned to China League One side Shanghai Shenxin for the 2019 season. ==Personal life== Dibba has a total of 14 siblings. Even though he has lived the majority of his life in Sweden, it was his dream to represent the Gambia national football team. He is a supporter of Real Madrid and names the Brazilian striker Ronaldo as his football idol. In August 2017, R&B; artist Madi Banja released a single called \\"Pa Dibba\\".

An inscription on the pedestal records that he began work on the piece in 1175 and brought it to completion the following year. The sculpture has been designated a National Treasure.The statue was designated a National Treasure in 1920, under the 1897 Ancient Temples and Shrines Preservation Law; with the 1950 Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties, the statue was redesignated an Important Cultural Property; the statue was again designated a National Treasure in 1993. Unkei's next documented works, from the early 1180s, were commissioned by military leaders prominent in the ensuing Kamakura shogunate, for temples in eastern Japan. These works are physically more massive and powerful, as are his giant Niō at Tōdai-ji. By contrast, in this early work Unkei employed a more \\"gentle\\" or \\"tranquil\\" style. ==Subject== Dainichi Nyorai (Sanskrit: Mahāvairocana) is the central deity of Esoteric Buddhism. As opposed to the \\"revealed teaching\\", understandable to the intellect of the common man, the \\"concealed teaching\\" (mikkyō) of Esoteric Buddhism offers Buddhahood and paradise on earth to the initiate, through ritual practice and the contemplation of sacred images. According to Kūkai, the founder of the Shingon school of Esoteric Buddhism in the early ninth century, \\"because the secret storehouse [Mikkyō teaching] is so profound and mysterious it is difficult to manifest with brush and ink [text]. Thus it is revealed to the unenlightened by adopting the form of images. The great variety of postures and mudrās are the effect of Buddha's great compassion. With a single glance [at the images] one becomes a Buddha.\\" Dainichi (lit. \\"Great Sun\\") is worshipped as the supreme, primordial sun Buddha and also appears as the central figure of the Five Wisdom Buddhas. Under the syncretic doctrine of honji suijaku, the Shinto sun goddess Amaterasu was considered a manifestation of Dainichi Nyorai. The term Nyorai (lit. \\"thus-come one\\") is an epithet for the enlightened Buddhas that occupy the highest rank in the Japanese Buddhist pantheon. In the Mandala of the Two Realms, the principle mandala for ritual activity and contemplation in Shingon Buddhism, Dainichi Nyorai appears in the centre of both the Diamond Realm and the Womb Realm. In the former, as defined by the Dainichi Sutra, Dainichi represents the \\"metaphysical presence that embodies reason\\"; in the latter, as defined by the Diamond Peak Sutra, Dainichi represents the \\"epistemological presence that embodies wisdom\\". ==Iconography== Unlike the other Buddhas, Dainichi Nyorai is typically depicted in the form of a boddhisattva, with the garments, adornments, and long hair of the nobility of ancient India. In this image Dainichi is bare-chested, with flowing draperies hanging from the left shoulder; the head is crowned, the arms, wrists, neck, chest, and legs bejewelled; the topknot is high, with long hair resting on the right shoulder. Dainichi Nyorai appears in two principal guises as denoted by the mudrā or ritual gesture formed by the hands, that of the Diamond Realm and that of the Womb Realm. Here the mudrā is that of the \\"knowledge fist\\" of the Diamond Realm, with the fingers of the right hand symbolizing the five elements penetrated by the Buddhist essence as represented by the index finger of the left hand. The gesture also symbolizes the mystic union of the material with the spiritual of yoga practice, which in Tibet and Nepal takes the form of the ecstatic Yab-Yum embrace, but in China and Japan is sublimated in this mudrā. The double round halo, one for the head attached to that for the body, represents the light emitted by the Buddha, as emphasized by the rays surrounding the lotus cushion on which the head rests. In the Brahma Net Sutra, translated into Chinese in 406 and copied and expounded on imperial orders through all the provinces in mid-eighth century Japan, Dainichi Nyorai appears seated on a lotus pedestal, around which all gather to hear his teaching of the law. Here Dainichi sits atop a six-tier lotus pedestal with alternately arranged petals. { width=\\"950px\\" align=\\"center\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" !  -  align=center 500px shikinasu may be translated literally as \\"bulging aubergine\\" } ==Technology== Approximately ninety percent of Important Cultural Property and National Treasure sculptures are made of wood. All of Unkei's surviving works are in this medium. This piece employs the joined-block technique known as yosegi-zukuri, which has the twin advantages of obviating the need for large pieces of timber while facilitating the hollowing-out process which helps reduce shrinkage and cracking. Six main blocks of hinoki or Japanese cypress were used, two vertical blocks arranged side by side and end on for the torso and head; one horizontal piece for the legs; one for the top-knot; and two wedges for the thighs; the arms are assembled from a number of further pieces. After carving, hollowing, and assembly, the statue was lacquered and covered in gold leaf. The double halo and pedestal are of similar materials. The eyes are of rock crystal, inserted into the open sockets from inside and held in place by bamboo pins, with painted pupils. Eyes formed in this way seem to move in the guttering firelight of a temple and are one of the defining features of the sculpture of the Kamakura period that began a decade later. The lips are painted red and the hair blue. The jewels and crown are of gilt bronze. ==History== According to an inscription in black ink on the underside of the lotus heart of the pedestal, the statue was begun by Unkei, \\"true apprentice of great busshi Kōkei\\", on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month of 1175 and was completed on the nineteenth day of the tenth month of 1176; Unkei's fee was forty-three lengths of Hachijō-jima silk.The inscription reads: 運慶承 安元元年十一月廿四日始之  給料物上品八丈絹肆拾参疋也  已上御身料也  奉渡安元弐秊丙申十月十九日  大仏師康慶  実弟子運慶 \\"Unkei in compliance: begun on the 24th day of the eleventh month of Angen 1 [1175]  for payment of forty-three lengths of superior quality silk cloth from Hachijō-jima  that is all as regards payment  completed and handed over in heishin [1176 per sexagenary cycle] on the 19th day of the tenth month of Angen 2 [1176]  great busshi Kōkei's  true apprentice, Unkei\\" The states that the statue was installed in the tahōtō. At an uncertain date two panels were opened in the back of the head of the statue, either for repairs to the eyes or to enable the insertion of holy objects, as found in numerous other instances. The statue survived the destruction of the tahōtō by fire during the Ōnin War; subsequently it was installed in the hondō. In 1921 repair work was carried out, at which time the inscription was discovered. The third tahōtō, erected to replace that moved to Kamakura in 1920, was constructed between 1986 and 1990. In 1991 the statue was exhibited at the Kyoto National Museum. Unkei's Dainichi Nyorai is now once again installed in the tahōtō, against a backdrop of painted Buddhas and vajra on the columns and wall behind the altar. ==See also== * List of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures) * Kei school ==NotesReferences== Category:National Treasures of Japan Category:Japanese sculpture Category:Buddhist sculpture Category:Kei school Category:1176 in Asia Category:Wooden sculptures in Japan Category:12th century in Japan ","title":"Dainichi Nyorai (Enjō-ji)"},{"id":"35286032","text":"Age-standardized deaths from breast cancer per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women. (The most common form of cancer is non-invasive non-melanoma skin cancer; non- invasive cancers are generally easily cured, cause very few deaths, and are routinely excluded from cancer statistics.) Breast cancer comprises 22.9% of invasive cancers in women and 16% of all female cancers. In 2008, breast cancer caused 458,503 deaths worldwide (13.7% of cancer deaths in women and 6.0% of all cancer deaths for men and women together).(cancer statistics often exclude non-melanoma skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma which though very common are rarely fatal) Lung cancer, the second most common cause of cancer-related death in women, caused 12.8% of cancer deaths in women (18.2% of all cancer deaths for men and women together). The number of cases worldwide has significantly increased since the 1970s, a phenomenon partly attributed to the modern lifestyles. == By age group == Breast cancer is strongly related to age, with only 5% of all breast cancers occurring in women under 40 years old.Breast Cancer: Breast Cancer in Young Women WebMD. Retrieved on September 9, 2009 == By region == The incidence of breast cancer varies greatly around the world: it is lowest in less-developed countries and greatest in the more-developed countries. In the twelve world regions, the annual age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 women are as follows: in Eastern Asia, 18; South Central Asia, 22; sub-Saharan Africa, 22; South- Eastern Asia, 26; North Africa and Western Asia, 28; South and Central America, 42; Eastern Europe, 49; Southern Europe, 56; Northern Europe, 73; Oceania, 74; Western Europe, 78; and in North America, 90.B. W. and Kleihues P. (Eds): World Cancer Report. IARCPress. Lyon 2003 United States US Cancer occurrence in women in the US by mortality. The lifetime risk for breast cancer in the United States is usually given as about 1 in 8 (12%) of women by age 95, with a 1 in 35 (3%) chance of dying from breast cancer. This calculation assumes that all women live to at least age 95, except for those who die from breast cancer before age 95.Olson, 2002. pages 199–200. Recent work, using real-world numbers, indicate that the actual risk is probably less than half the theoretical risk. The United States has the highest annual incidence rates of breast cancer in the world; 128.6 per 100,000 in whites and 112.6 per 100,000 among African Americans. It is the second-most common cancer (after skin cancer) and the second-most common cause of cancer death (after lung cancer) in women. In 2007, breast cancer was expected to cause 40,910 deaths in the US (7% of cancer deaths; almost 2% of all deaths). This figure includes 450-500 annual deaths among men out of 2000 cancer cases. In the US, both incidence and death rates for breast cancer have been declining in the last few years. In the US, the age-adjusted incidence of breast cancer per 100,000 women rose from around 102 cases per year in the 1970s to around 141 in the late 1990s, and has since fallen, holding steady around 125 since 2003. Age-adjusted deaths from breast cancer per 100,000 women rose slightly from 31.4 in 1975 to 33.2 in 1989 and have declined steadily since, to 20.5 in 2014. Nevertheless, a US study conducted in 2005 indicated that breast cancer remains the most feared disease, even though heart disease is a much more common cause of death among women. Studies suggest that women overestimate their risk of breast cancer. In Breast Cancer Data, Hope, Fear and Confusion, By DENISE GRADY, New York Times, January 26, 1999.

The age-standardised incidence rate of breast cancer is 113.4 per 100,000 populations in Wales and there has been a significant increase in the incidence of breast cancer in Wales over the last three decades, which is likely to be partly due to the introduction of the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme. Developing countries \\"Breast cancer in less developed countries, such as those in South America, is a major public health issue. It is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women in countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. The expected numbers of new cases and deaths due to breast cancer in South America for the year 2001 are approximately 70,000 and 30,000, respectively.\\"(Schwartzmann, 2001, p 118) However, because of a lack of funding and resources, treatment is not always available to those suffering with breast cancer. It has also been shown that while the overall incidence of breast cancer appears to be higher in Caucasian women, black African women tend to present at a younger age and with a more aggressive disease pattern, a pattern that has also been reported among black women born and bred in London suggesting a more genetic link rather than only an environmental cause or late presentation.  Sub-Saharan Africa   Incidence and Mortality  Data on breast cancer in Sub Saharan Africa is available, though extremely limited compared to developed countries. Breast cancer has the highest incidence among Sub Saharan African women, and has now also the highest mortality rate in many of the countries in the region, before cervical cancer. Breast cancer causes 20% of cancer deaths in women and represents 25% of cancers diagnosed. Incidence rates of breast cancer varies from region to region in Sub Saharan Africa and are 30.4, 26.8, 38.6 and 38.9 respectively in Eastern Africa, Central Africa, Western Africa and Southern Africa.Ferlay J, Soerjomataram I, Ervik M, et al. GLOBOCAN 2012 v1.0, Cancer Incidence and Mortality Worldwide: IARC CancerBase No. 11 [Internet] Lyon, France: International Agency for Research on Cancer; 2013. Sub Saharan Africa has lower incidence rates for breast cancer than developed countries but the mortality rates reflected in the region are much higher. Many reasons were found to be the source of this disparity, including the fact that breast cancer is diagnosed at later stages in Sub Saharan Africa. For example, while Central Africa had a mortality/incidence ratio of 0.55 in 2012, the US had only 0.16. In addition to being diagnosed at later stages, breast cancer in Sub Saharan Africa was also found to have an earlier onset compared to western countries. Screening is considered an important tool to tackle the late stage diagnosis of breast cancer by most policy makers in African Countries, especially given that treatment is greatly limited by the lack of resources. More research is also required to produce more updated data on breast cancer and better understand the variances there and how they affect the burden of the disease in the region.  Challenges  One of the major challenges in reducing the burden of breast cancer in Sub Saharan Africa remains the lack of National Cancer Control Programs and the lack of human as well as financial resources. The majority of countries lack integrated prevention and treatment programs, which complicates the control of the disease in those countries. Also, the regions disposes of a disproportionally low number of cancer registries, along with resources and facilities for treatment. This all factors into the different countries' difficulties to ensure that women at high risk are identified and that the disease is diagnosed early enough to have better chances of being treated. The lack of affordable and effective treatment methods also renders the efforts to promote early detection because those affected are then faced with inaccessible and unaffordable resources in the cases where they are available. The challenges to tackling breast cancer in Africa are varied, not fully understood, and further complicated by possible unique risk factors that could be highlighted by further studies, but developing strategies that foster early detection are viewed in literature as a priority for effective fight against the disease.  Male breast cancer  Male breast cancer is a much less talked about issue due to its lower incidence with less than 1% of breast cancer in Sub Saharan Africa. A review of the disease found that male to female ratio was higher in Sub Saharan Countries than in developed countries and that onset of the disease occurred on average 7 years latter in men than in women. There is a noticeable decrease in the male to female breast cancer ratio in recent years but that might be associated to the recent increase in female breast cancer in the region. There is still little understanding of the causes of the higher risk for male breast cancer in Sub Saharan Africa and on male breast cancer in general, leading to poor clinical management of the disease. == See also == * Risk factors for breast cancer General: * Epidemiology of cancer ==References== Category:Breast cancer Breast Cancer ","title":"Epidemiology of breast cancer"},{"id":"35286041","text":" The Fresh Breeze Monster is a German paramotor, designed and produced by Fresh Breeze of Wedemark for powered paragliding.Bertrand, Noel; Rene Coulon; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2003-04, page 68.

The tour is to promote her second album, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded. The tour began in May 2012 with shows in Australia and Asia. The tour then continued on to Europe and North America in June, July, and August 2012. The tour came to a close on August 14, 2012 in New York City at the Roseland Ballroom. The final show was a part of a free Pepsi promotional concert. Attendees were only eligible for tickets if they called radio stations Hot 97, Power 105, Z-100, 92.3 Now, and WBLI or tweet Nicki Minaj or Pepsi on Twitter. After playing 41 shows on 4 continents, Minaj quickly followed up the tour with the Pink Friday: Reloaded Tour. ==Background and development== While promoting her second album in the UK, Minaj revealed tour dates for major cities in England. The singer officially announced the tour via Twitter on May 1, 2012—showcasing the stage resembling Barbie Dreamhouse. Minaj stated that she will play radio and outdoor festivals in conduction with arenas and theatres. She also mentions the tour will have an \\"intimate yet big\\" feel. Laurieann Gibson will serve as creative director and choreographer for the tour. Gibson stated \\"Nicki Minaj was so much fun for me, and it was like a real breath of fresh air, and musically, to get back to the rap game, to see a female MC dominate the pop charts, this, historically, for me, I feel a bit of responsibility\\", in a MTV interview. ==Concert synopsis== The concert is divided into five acts, they all incorporate Minaj's hip-hop, pop, rap, and R&B; styles of music. An interlude kicks-off the show with Minaj's voice explaining that her alter ego \\"Roman\\", warrior of \\"Pinkslam\\", must travel for 40 days, and 40 nights, to planet Earth to defeat an evil force known as \\"Nemesis\\". Minaj begins the concert in a black cloak, singing the fiery-bar spitting song \\"Roman's Revenge\\" or the fast-paced \\"Roman Holiday\\" while standing on top of the stage with a church themed backdrop. The dancers are also dressed in black cloaks. After the first chorus, Minaj takes off the cloak and reveals a new outfit which consists of pink and black polka dot high rise panties, and a yellow and black polka dot jacket, or a graffiti themed jacket, paired with leggings underneath. The dancers also appear in different attire after their cloaks are removed. She then burst out into her hip-hop segment starting off with \\"Did it on 'Em\\" followed by her verses in \\"I Am Your Leader\\" continued with \\"Beez in the Trap\\" and then on to a snippet of \\"Stupid Hoe\\" before rolling into her verse in Big Sean's \\"Dance (A$$)\\". After a brief pause Minaj continues the show with a new segment starting with \\"Right by My Side\\" that flows into \\"Champion\\" and concludes the segment with \\"Moment 4 Life\\" while wearing the same attire as last segment. The medley's backdrop consisted of a sky themed backdrop. After finishing the medley Minaj heads backstage to change outfits while the DJ plays an interlude leading up to the next segment. After the interlude ends Minaj returns to the stage wearing a white vest, white leggings, and a white tutu accompanied with white high heels. Minaj's dancers have also changed into gold attire. Minaj then takes a splatter-painted gun and sprays the crowd with white fog. After Minaj sets the gun down she returns to her group of female dancers before jumping into \\"Starships\\" which starts the pop segment of the concert. To go along with \\"Starships\\" the backdrop was inside of a \\"Starship\\". After \\"Starships\\", she then sings \\"Pound the Alarm\\". Next, Minaj walks around the stage slapping her dancer's butts before heading into \\"Whip It\\". Minaj then dives into her verses in David Guetta's dance anthem \\"Where Them Girls At\\". Then Minaj performs \\"Turn Me On\\". Minaj then walks off stage for a second time for another outfit change. At the end of the interlude Nicki emerges from backstage with a pink dress on and also changed her wig to a short blond wig with pink accents. She then talks about how she got her heart broken and wanted to literally kill someone. She followed that statement with saying \\"But instead I wrote a song.\\" which lead into \\"Fire Burns\\" with an Autumn themed background. She followed the song by then performing \\"Save Me\\" with Barbie's house as a backdrop. After \\"Save Me\\" she left the stage which ended her softer, more emotional segment of the show. Another DJ interlude played while she made her final costume change of the concert. For the last segment Minaj is dressed with graffiti leggings, a striped shirt, black panties, with a pink hat and some necklaces. She had also changed her wig to solid black with bangs. The background for this segment is a basic speaker system. She then performs a mixtape medley which consisted of songs such as \\"Go Hard\\", \\"Sweet Dreams\\", \\"Slumber Party\\", \\"Beam Me Up Scotty\\", \\"Freaky Gurl\\", \\"I Get Crazy\\", and \\"Itty Bitty Piggy\\" from her mixtapes. In the European leg of the tour Minaj also performed \\"Itty Bitty Piggy\\" in the medley. Minaj then performs \\"Come On A Cone\\" before the final medley. The final medley consisted of songs such as \\"Up All Night\\", \\"Make Me Proud\\", \\"My Chick Bad\\", \\"Bottoms Up\\", \\"Monster\\", \\"Letting Go (Dutty Love)\\", \\"Hold Yuh\\", \\"BedRock\\", \\"Roman Reloaded\\", and \\"Roman in Moscow\\". Following the final medley Minaj states \\"Is there a song you haven't heard yet?\\", which leads right into \\"Super Bass\\". Minaj finishes \\"Super Bass\\" at the top of the stage with white fog shooting in the air along each staircase before saying \\"Thank you and goodnight!\\" which leads to an encore chorus before Nicki and her dancers exit the stage. ==Critical response== The tour received generally positive reviews from music critics. Kicking off the tour in Australia, music critics gave the performances extremely positive reviews. Kathy McCabe (The Daily Telegraph) writes that Minaj was \\"colorful\\" during the tour's debut at the Horden Pavilion. She continues, \\"Minaj graciously brought her arena show to town with its awesome backdrop of videos, those ripped dancers, a song list of hits, her graciousness and potty mouth, and smashed it all together into a one-hour show. A lot of smoke and mirrors but all of it rather delectable. Except for the poor mums\\". Hannah Kimber (news.com.au) states Minaj's show in Sydney was an array of \\"deep beats, technicolour lighting and Disney inspired ensembles\\". She further states, \\"It was a night of tiny tasty Nicki treats all mashed into a mini musical feast with tight choreography and lots to look at. But 65 minutes was not long enough for a full Nicki fix and the rabid Barbz in Sydney craved more Minaj\\". At the Hisense Arena, Tran Nguyen (Take 40 Australia) humorously gave the show eight out of ten weaves. He says, \\"it was her performance of \\"Starships\\" that drove the fans completely wild. The ground shook harder, and more arms were flailing about (and blocking my view—although, my lack of height may have something to with that). Fans were jumping up and down, and occasionally busting a move or two\\". The concert at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre was given two and a half out of five stars by Bridie Jabour (Brisbane Times). She says, \\"\\"Nicki did the obligatory good night and I love you and left the stage. And then something happened that I have not witnessed at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre or even the Tivoli. Everyone just left. There were no screams for an encore, no chanting of her name, no pleading for her to return and do just one more song. Nicki had finished her show and her fans were more than ready for it to be finished\\". Alexis Petridis from The Guardian attended the show at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in London, he gave the Pink Friday Tour an average score with 3 out of 5 stars, saying \\"It seems a strange thing to say about a performance that opens with a woman rapping \\"I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt\\", but there's something oddly restrained about Nicki Minaj's live show. Then Petridis later commented on how moderate the show was in comparison to her exorcism-themed performance at the 54th Grammy Awards, \\"Given this is a woman who staged a mock exorcism on stage at the Grammys, before being hoisted into the air on wires while singing O Come All Ye Faithful, it's a relatively stripped-down show, which cleaves more to hip-hop tradition than pop extravaganza. There are costume changes and a confetti cannon, but there's no band, just a small troupe of dancers, a DJ and a hype man\\". Jon Carmanica of the NY Times, gave the tour a positive review speaking on her ability to reach pop and hip-hop audiences, \\"Unlike almost any other rapper, she manages to exist on pop radio and hip-hop radio simultaneously (generally with different songs), and she's equally comfortable in both spaces.\\" ==Opening acts== *Stooshe (UK) *Timomatic (Melbourne, Sydney) *Stan Walker (Brisbane) *2 Chainz (North America) * Baby K (Italy) • Mr Polska (Neatherlands) ==SetlistTour dates== {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! style=\\"width:150px;\\"Date ! style=\\"width:150px;\\"City ! style=\\"width:150px;\\"Country ! style=\\"width:275px;\\"Venue - ddd;\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Leg 1 —Oceania - May 16, 2012 Sydney rowspan=\\"3\\"Australia Hordern Pavilion - May 18, 2012 Melbourne Hisense Arena - May 19, 2012 Brisbane Brisbane Entertainment Centre - ddd;\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Leg 2 —Asia - May 22, 2012 Osaka rowspan=\\"3\\"Japan Namba Hatch - May 23, 2012 Tokyo Zepp Tokyo - May 25, 2012 Yokohama Yokohama Bay Hall - ddd;\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Leg 3 —North America - June 1, 2012 Camden rowspan=\\"1\\"United States Susquehanna Bank Center - ddd;\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Leg 4 — Europe - June 8, 2012 Stockholm Sweden Annexet - June 9, 2012 Oslo Norway Oslo Spektrum - June 11, 2012 Copenhagen Denmark Falkoner Teatret - June 13, 2012 Brussels Belgium Ancienne Belgique - June 16, 2012 Berlin Germany Tempodrom - June 18, 2012 Amsterdam Netherlands Heineken Music Hall - June 21, 2012 Milan Italy Discoteca Alcatraz - June 23, 2012 rowspan=\\"3\\"London rowspan=\\"5\\"England Hackney Marshes - June 24, 2012 rowspan=\\"2\\"HMV Hammersmith Apollo - June 25, 2012 - June 26, 2012 Birmingham National Indoor Arena - June 28, 2012 Manchester O2 Apollo Manchester - July 6, 2012 Paris France Zénith de Paris - July 7, 2012 London England Hyde Park - July 8, 2012 Kinross Scotland Balado Airfield - ddd;\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Leg 5 —Asia - July 11, 2012 Pasay Philippines Mall of Asia Arena - ddd;\\" colspan=\\"4\\"Leg 6 —North America - July 16, 2012 Chicago rowspan=\\"18\\"United States Chicago Theatre - July 17, 2012 Detroit Fox Theatre - July 18, 2012 Minneapolis State Theater - July 19, 2012 Cleveland State Theatre - July 21, 2012 Washington, D.C.

It lived during the Toyonian stage (Upper Olenellus-zone), , in what is today the southwestern United States. It can easily be distinguished from other trilobites by its club-like genal spines. == Etymology == Peachella is named in honor of Benjamin Neeve Peach, a British geologist. The species epithed brevispina is derived from Latin and means 'short spine'. P. iddingsi was named in honor of Joseph P. Iddings, an accomplished American geologist. == Origin == The earliest occurrence of the ancestral Eopeachella angustispina predates both Peachella species, its latest occurrence overlaps with P. iddingsi, which, in turn overlaps with P. brevispina. E. angustispina has thick, tapered, blunt, genal spines and shallow but clear glabellar furrows. This species therefore bridges the morphological gap between the derived Peachella species and earlier olenelloid relatives that possess ‘normal’ genal spines. == Description == As with most early trilobites, Peachella has an almost flat exoskeleton, that is only thinly calcified. It also shares crescent-shaped eye ridges, but these rise above the exoskeleton. As part of the suborder Olenellina, Peachella lacks dorsal sutures. Like all other members of the superfamily Olenelloidea, the eye-ridges spring from the back of the frontal lobe (L4) of the central area of the cephalon, that is called glabella. Peachella is an average sized biceratopsid trilobite, that exhibits the strongly effaced cephalic features that are typical for a clade wikthin the subfamily Biceratopsinae. It has the enormous sickle-shaped pleural spines on the 3rd thoracal segment with the rest of the family Biceratopsidae (except for Bolbolenellus). Peachella is unique in having short, wide, strongly inflated genal spines, with broadly rounded tips. The cephalon is semi-circular in outline with short, strongly inflated rounded spines. The central area of the cephalon (or glabella) is elongated, reaching the anterior border, but its features are strongly effaced, almost showing no furrows. The frontal 14 or 15 segments (or prothorax) can readily be distinguished from the terminal 9 to 11 (forming the opisthothorax). The last segment of the prothorax may carry a large spine. The tips of the pleura are rounded, which is unlike the usual pointed terminations in other Olenellina. The tailshield (or pygidium) is very small and subquadrate in shape.  Differences with some other Biceratopsinae  Biceratops nevadensis and Emigrantia share extremely effaced cephalic features with Peachella. Biceratops however lacks genal spines. In Emigrantia the genal spines are longer than the cephalon and attach halfway down its side (or lateral margin), instead of being short and bloated. Eopeachella has genal spines which are inflated only the basis, and the cephalic features are only moderately effaced. == Distribution == Specimens of Peachella brevispina have been collected from the middle Peachella iddingsi-zone of the Dublin Hills, Eagle Mountain, and Nopah Range, all in Inyo County , California. Further specimens were found in the Chief Range and Highland Range, in Lincoln County, Nevada. Peachella iddingsi, occurs in the lower half of the Peachella iddingsi-zone of the Marble Mountains and Providence Mountains (San Bernardino County), Grapevine Mountains, Funeral Mountain, Emigrants Pass in the Nopah Range, Eagle Mountain, Resting Springs Range and Last Chance Range (all Inyo County), in California. P. iddlingsi also comes from Groom Range, Delamar Mountains, and Chief Range (all Lincoln County), the Desert Range and the Spring Mountains (Clark County), Toiyable Range (Lander County), and Prospect Peak (Eureka County), Nevada.The Paleobiology Database == Habitat == Peachella species were probably marine bottom dwellers, like all Olenellina. == Ecology == P. brevispina occurs together with Bristolia fragilis, Olenellus nevadensis and P. iddingsi. P. iddingsi occurs together with Bristolia fragilis, Bristolia aff. fragilis A, Paranephrolenellus besti, Mesonacis fremonti, Olenellus nevadensis, Olenellus aff. terminatus, and the tops of the ranges of Eopeachella angustispina and Bristolia anteros. The range of P. iddingsi coincides with the bottom of the range of P. brevispina, and may even fully enclose it. == Key to the Species == { - valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"left\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" width=\\"3%\\"  1  width=\\"97%\\" Genal spines strongly inflated, blunt and club-like.

Originally starting his career in International Wrestling Association of Japan, where he worked under his real name, Yamada found a new home promotion in 1999 in Osaka Pro Wrestling, where he began wrestling under a mask and the ring name Black Buffalo. For most of his career in Osaka Pro, Yamada has portrayed a villainous character, having been a part of every major villainous alliance in the history of the promotion. During his first years in the promotion, Buffalo went on to become a four-time Tag Team Champion. In February 2008, Buffalo was forced to unmask and reveal his true identity, after losing a match, and afterwards began teaming with the man, who unmasked him, Tigers Mask, with two becoming two-time Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Champions together. Finally, in March 2012, Buffalo managed to win Osaka Pro's top title, the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship. Backstage, Yamada served as the vice president of Osaka Pro Wrestling. Yamada left Osaka Pro Wrestling after the promotion went through a corporate restructuring in April 2014, shortening his ring name to . ==Professional wrestling career== Debut (1993) Yamada made his professional wrestling debut on August 2, 1993, working under his real name for the Oriental Puroresu promotion. Shortly afterwards, he left the promotion to become a freelancer. IWA Japan (1994–1999) In 1994, Yamada joined the International Wrestling Association of Japan promotion. During his years in IWA Japan, Yamada had several high- profile matches with the likes of Cactus Jack, Terry Funk and Tiger Jeet Singh, and, at the end of his run, also served as the president of the promotion. He quit the promotion in 1999. Osaka Pro Wrestling (1999–2014) In April 1999, Yamada joined the Osaka Pro Wrestling promotion, where he began wrestling under a mask as Black Buffalo, a character inspired by the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes baseball team. He made his debut for the promotion at its first event on April 29, where he, Dick Togo and Violencia, forming the villainous alliance Legion of Violence (LOV), were defeated in a six-man tag team main event by Masato Yakushiji, Naohiro Hoshikawa and Super Delfin. Buffalo kept teaming with Togo for the rest of the year. On November 21, Buffalo won his first title in Osaka Pro, when he defeated Super Delfin for the UWF Super Welterweight Championship, only to lose it back to him seven days later. In early 2000, LOV was joined by Daio Quallt and Policeme~n, replacing Violencia. On May 1, Buffalo and Togo defeated Super Delfin and Super Demekin in the finals to win the 1st Anniversary Tag Tournament. In September, Buffalo took part in the inaugural Tenno-zan tournament, where he made it to the semifinals, before being eliminated by Super Delfin. After Dick Togo left Osaka Pro at the end of 2000, LOV was disbanded and replaced by the new group, FLUXxx, as a member of which Buffalo formed a new tag team named Infinity with Tsubasa. After reaching the semifinals of the 2001 Osaka Tag Festival, Buffalo and Tsubasa defeated Super Delfin and Takehiro Murahama on July 21 to win the vacant Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship. They would lose the title to Murahama and Kaiju Zeta Mandora on August 24. The following October's Tenno-zan saw a repeat of the previous year's tournament as Buffalo was eliminated in the semifinals by Super Delfin. On January 27, 2002, Buffalo, Tsubasa and Gamma defeated Super Delfin, Super Demekin and Takehiro Murahama to win the Trios Cup Tournament. On August 25, Buffalo and Tsubasa regained the Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship by defeating the Kishiwada Gurentai (Big Boss MA-G-MA and Daio Quallt). After a five-month reign, they would lose the title to Jyushin Thunder Liger and Takehiro Murahama on February 1, 2003. After Buffalo and Tsubasa failed to regain the title from Liger and Murahama on August 13, Buffalo turned on Tsubasa on November 15 and jumped to Big Boss MA-G-MA's Kishiwada Gurentai stable. Buffalo and Tsubasa had their big grudge match against each other on May 29, 2004, ending with Buffalo picking up the win. On December 19, Buffalo and Daio Quallt defeated Billyken Kid and Tigers Mask to win the Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship. Their reign would last until February 13, 2005, when they were defeated by Billyken Kid and Perro. On April 29, Buffalo and Tsubasa reformed Infinity for one night, when they defeated Kageki Pro representatives Aztec and Kaze in a special interpromotional tag team match. After the Kishiwasa Gurentai was disbanded in the aftermath of Big Boss MA-G-MA leaving Osaka Pro, Buffalo, Hideyoshi, Masamune and Toru Owashi formed the promotion's new top villainous alliance, Buraikan, on June 25. In November, Buffalo made it to the semifinals of the Tenno-zan for the third time, but was there once again defeated by Super Delfin. On January 28, 2006, longtime babyface Billyken Kid shocked Osaka Pro by turning on Tigers Mask and the Osaka Pro Seikigun (\\"regular army\\") and taking over Buraikan, which was then renamed Vendaval, with Buffalo becoming his second-in-command. On February 26, Buffalo and BKK defeated Flash Moon and Tigers Mask to win the Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship. The two teams faced each other in a rematch on June 3 in the finals of the 2006 Tag Festival, which was won by Flash Moon and Tigers Mask. On July 15, Buffalo added another title to his résumé, when he defeated ten other men to win the Osaka Pro Wrestling Battle Royal Championship. However, on July 29, Osaka Pro announced that Buffalo had suffered a rotator cuff tear in his right shoulder and stripped him of both the Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team and the Osaka Pro Wrestling Battle Royal Championship. Buffalo wearing his mask After remaining inactive for the rest of 2006, Buffalo showed up in Mexico in early 2007, making his debut for AAA on February 16 as a member of La Legión Extranjera, a villainous stable of foreigners. During his stay in Mexico, Buffalo teamed with Rossy Moreno to unsuccessfully challenge Cynthia Moreno and El Oriental for the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship on March 23. After spending almost a year away from Osaka Pro, Buffalo made a surprise return to the promotion on June 30, 2007, by attacking Kuishinbo Kamen and Miracle Man, revealing himself as Bad Force leader Gaina's partner in the 2007 Tag Festival. After defeating Miracle Man and Kuishinbo Kamen in less than a minute, Buffalo and Gaina picked up their second win of the night by defeating Atsushi Kotoge and Daisuke Harada in the following match. After defeating Asian Cougar and Tsubasa in their semifinal match on July 8, Buffalo and Gaina advanced to the finals of the Tag Festival, where, on July 14, they were defeated by Tigers Mask and Billyken Kid, who had rejoined the Osaka Pro Seikigun during Buffalo's time away from the promotion. On August 25, Buffalo unsuccessfully challenged Tigers Mask for the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship. Buffalo kept teaming with Bad Force for the rest of the year, pinning Tigers Mask in a non-title match on October 8. On December 8, Buffalo pinned Tigers Mask again, this time in a Captain's Fall tag team match, and afterwards challenged him to a match for the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship. On December 22, the two men agreed to the match with the added stipulation, that the loser of the match would also be unmasked. On February 11, 2008, Black Buffalo and Tigers Mask faced each other in a Mask vs. Mask match for the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship in the main event of Osaka Pro's biggest annual event, Osaka Hurricane. After being pinned by Tigers Mask for the win, Buffalo was forced to unmask and reveal himself as Keisuke Yamada of IWA Japan. In an out-of-character post-match speech, Yamada revealed that the real reason he had spent a year away from Osaka Pro was that he had been battling depression and alcoholism, which he had managed to overcome with Tigers Mask's support. Buffalo was then kicked out of Bad Force, which led to Tigers Mask inviting him to join the Osaka Pro Seikigun. After spending some time away from Osaka Pro, Buffalo returned to the promotion on March 29, accepting Tigers Mask's invitation. Despite being unmasked, Yamada continued performing under the Black Buffalo ring name. In October 2008, the Osaka Pro Seikigun was broken into two camps following problems between Billyken Kid and Tigers Mask, which eventually led to Tigers Mask, Black Buffalo and Masamune breaking away from the group and forming a new villainous alliance, unofficially referred to as the \\"Rudo Army\\". On November 15, Buffalo and Tigers Mask defeated Atsushi Kotoge and Daisuke Harada, with help from the debuting Orochi, to become the interim Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Champions. Osaka Pro had been forced to introduce the title, after one half of the reigning Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Champions, Asian Cougar, had been injured at the hands of the Rudo Army. In December, Buffalo made it to the finals of the 2008 Tenno-zan tournament, before being defeated by Billyken Kid. On January 1, 2009, Buffalo and Tigers Mask defeated Mucha Lucha (Asian Cougar and Tsubasa) in a title unification match to become the new Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Champions. They would lose the title to Asian Cougar and Great Sasuke on February 15 at Osaka Hurricane 2009, only to regain it on May 20 at Osaka Pro's tenth anniversary event. The team's second and Buffalo's sixth reign ended on July 18, when they were defeated by Sengoku (Hideyoshi and Masamune). During the summer, Yamada returned to IWA Japan, now working as Black Buffalo, for a short run as the IWA World Heavyweight Champion. Back in Osaka Pro, Buffalo's and Tigers Mask's stable, which now also included The Bodyguard, Orochi and Tadasuke, was officially named LOV in reference to Osaka Pro's original villainous alliance. In January 2009, LOV, still villains within Osaka Pro, became de facto babyfaces by starting an interpromotional storyline rivalry with the Dragon Gate promotion, starting on January 17, when Black Buffalo and Tigers Mask invaded a Dragon Gate event and attacked Cima, who had publicly been making disparaging remarks about Osaka Pro. The rivalry was mainly contested between Cima and Tigers Mask; Black Buffalo's participation culminated on July 11, when he, Tigers Mask and The Bodyguard unsuccessfully challenged Cima, Gamma and Genki Horiguchi for the Open the Triangle Gate Championship. LOV's babyface turn would be finalized on August 28, when Orochi turned on the stable, helping Asian Cougar defeat Tigers Mask for the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship. The newly renamed Kuuga, Orochi and another LOV turncoat, The Bodyguard, would then form the Joker stable, which took over LOV's spot as the promotion's top villainous alliance. On January 29, 2011, Buffalo and Tigers Mask challenged Kuuga and Orochi for the Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship, but were defeated, when Tadasuke also turned on them and jumped to Joker. On February 27, Buffalo was forced to join Joker, after he and Tigers Mask were defeated in a tag team match by Orochi and Tadasuke. Meanwhile, Tigers Mask kept LOV alive by recruiting Naoki Setoguchi as his new partner. On March 5, Buffalo defeated Tigers Mask in a singles match, following interference from members of Joker. After refusing to return to his villainous antics, Buffalo turned on Joker on March 13 and returned to LOV. After LOV picked up two big wins over Joker, first on April 10, when Buffalo, Tigers Mask and Naoki Setoguchi defeated Kuuga, Tadasuke and Hayata to win the 12th Anniversary Six Man Tag Team Tournament, and then, when Tigers Mask regained the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship from Kuuga on April 29, Tigers Mask suddenly announced that he was disbanding LOV and rejoining the Osaka Pro Seikigun, along with Buffalo and Setoguchi. In June, Buffalo and Tigers Mask entered the 2011 Tag Festival. After two wins and one loss, they advanced to the finals, where, on June 26, they defeated Billyken Kid and Joker leader Kuuga to win the tournament. After a disappointing 2011 Tenno- zan, where Buffalo was eliminated in the first round by American Chikara representative Jigsaw, his 2012 started with him defeating seven other men, including Tigers Mask, in a gauntlet match on February 26, to become the number one contender to new Osaka Pro Wrestling Champion, Daisuke Harada. On March 25, Buffalo defeated Harada to win the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship for the first time in his thirteenth year in the promotion. Buffalo made his first successful title defense on May 26, defeating Joker member Spider J. On July 22, Buffalo main evented his second Hurricane event, in which he lost the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship back to Daisuke Harada, ending his reign at 119 days. On November 3, Buffalo teamed with Tigers Mask to unsuccessfully challenge Harada's Glare stablemates Hayata and Tadasuke for the Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship. On January 19, 2013, Buffalo teamed with fellow Osaka Pro Seikigun members Kazuaki Mihara and Naoki Setoguchi in a six- man tag team main event, where they were defeated by Glare. After the match, Glare leader Daisuke Harada revealed that he had recruited a new member to his stable, someone who agreed with his idea of changing Osaka Pro. He then revealed Black Buffalo as his newest ally, much to the dismay of the Osaka Pro Seikigun, especially Tigers Mask. On January 26, Buffalo, Harada, Hayata and Tadasuke defeated Billyken Kid, Kazuaki Mihara, Naoki Setoguchi and Tigers Mask in an eight-man tag team main event, with Buffalo submitting Tigers Mask for the win. After the match, he challenged the Osaka Pro Seikigun to an elimination match, where the losing team would be forced to disband. After Buffalo and Tigers Mask had eliminated each other from the match on February 24, Harada pinned Billyken Kid for the final elimination, saving Glare and forcing Seikigun to disband. On March 2, Billyken Kid and Kazuaki Mihara joined Glare, announcing they now agreed with the stable's \\"revolution\\". Glare then declared war on Joker and Unique Gundan, the two remaining stables in Osaka Pro. The following major Osaka Pro event on March 24 saw former rivals, Tigers Mask and Joker's Orochi, come together to defeat Buffalo and Billyken Kid in a grudge tag team match. The following month, Glare was disbanded, when Daisuke Harada and Hayata quit Osaka Pro. From May 26 to June 23, Buffalo and Billyken Kid took part in the 2013 Osaka Tag Festival, making it to the final day with a chance of winning the tournament, however, a loss against the reigning Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Champions, former Glare stablemates Kazuaki Mihara and Tadasuke, meant that they dropped behind the Big Guns (The Bodyguard and Zeus) in the final standings. On July 18, Buffalo made his debut for the Pro Wrestling Noah promotion in his home prefecture of Tottori, losing to Maybach Taniguchi in a singles match. The following day, he pinned Hitoshi Kumano in a tag team match, where he and Gastón Mateo faced Kumano and Pesadilla. On August 10, Buffalo and nine other wrestlers revived the Osaka Pro Seikigun in order to battle the new Bad Stream stable. The first big battle between the Seikigun and Bad Stream took place on August 25, when Buffalo, The Bodyguard, Naoki Setoguchi and Zeus defeated Kazuaki Mihara, Mikey Broderick, Quiet Storm and Tadasuke in a four-on-four elimination tag team match. On September 15, Buffalo unsuccessfully challenged Bad Stream leader Quiet Storm for the Osaka Pro Wrestling Championship. On March 1, 2014, Black Buffalo, as the vice president of Osaka Pro Wrestling, announced that the promotion would be folding due to financial difficulties on April 20 with all of its workers becoming freelancers. It was later announced that Osaka Pro Wrestling would continue under new management. On April 20, Buffalo wrestled his final match as an Osaka Pro Wrestling affiliated worker, teaming with Billyken Kid and Bull Armor Takuya in a six-man tag team match, where they were defeated by The Bodyguard, Quiet Storm and Zeus. Freelancing and Makai (2014–present) Buffalo in August 2016 On April 22, 2014, Yamada announced that in the future he would be working under a new mask with the shortened ring name Buffalo. Yamada also started working for the Tottori Darazu Puroresu promotion under the ring name Inaba no Buffalo (\\"Buffalo of Inaba\\").

Sharp served as the chairman of the Division of Geological Sciences at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) from 1952 to 1968. He built the modern department and especially recruited new faculty in geochemistry, tectonic geomorphology, planetary science, and field geology. == Biography == Professor Sharp specialized in geomorphology and published heavily in glacial terrain (the Sierra Nevada, Blue Glacier in the Olympic Peninsula, and Alaska), Mojave Desert terrain, and the Ruby-East Humboldt Range in north-central Nevada. Sharp retired in 1979 but continued leading geological field trips afterwards (with emphasis on the Grand Canyon geology using rubber rafts). Robert Sharp was a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences and received the National Medal of Science from President George H. W. Bush in 1989. Professor Sharp won the Penrose Medal from the Geological Society of America, its highest honor. Sharp was honored by Caltech as the first named professorship in geology: the Robert Phillip Sharp Chair in Geology. Sharp was a native son of Oxnard, California. He attended Caltech as an undergraduate, beginning in 1930, earning a bachelor's degree (1934) in geology, and master's degree (1935) in geology. While at Caltech, he was quarterback on the football team. He matriculated to Harvard University for a doctorate (1938) in geology under Professor Kirk Bryan. Sharp served in the United States Army during World War II as an analyst in the Arctic, Desert and Tropical Information Center and achieved the rank of captain. During World War II, Sharp performed extensive field work in the Aleutian Islands of the Alaskan Peninsula, simultaneously testing new arctic clothing for soldiers, and quietly performing geological mapping of several islands, which he published in the Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. Sharp was briefly an instructor in geology at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign before World War II, then briefly an Assistant Professor of Geology at the University of Minnesota immediately after the war. As soon as possible, Caltech's Division Chairman Ian Campbell arranged for Sharp to return home to Caltech as a full professor in 1947. Sharp remained at Caltech for the next half-century, and was quickly promoted to the Chairman of the Division of Geological Sciences, later renamed to the Division of Geological and Planetary Sciences. While at Caltech, Sharp mentored dozens of doctoral students in field geomorphology; these are now working at the United States Geological Survey facility in Menlo Park, California and in leading geology departments throughout North America. Sharp became a published expert on the glacial geomorphology of the Sierra Nevada range, the Trinity Alps of northwestern California, the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, and Mount Saint Elias in the Fairweather Range of Alaska. In the winter season, he focused his geological field work in the Mojave Desert of California, with emphasis on the geomorphology of Cima Dome, and the sliding stones on the Racetrack Playa in northern Death Valley. Robert Phillip Sharp was an expert on the physics of blown sand and the formation of sand dunes in the Mojave Desert and the Coachella Valley. He was awarded the Kirk Bryan Award by the Geological Society of America for his scholarly publications on the geomorphology of sand dunes in desert terrain. Professor Sharp loved weekend field trips, and so he authored a number of field books in geology of southern California, published by Mountain Press. While in his sixties, Sharp continued to teach rigorous field geology to Caltech geology students during summer classes. Field geology classes were taught at Henry Mountain in Utah, where Grove Karl Gilbert discovered laccoliths. After retiring from Caltech, Sharp and his wife Jean moved their home from Altadena to Santa Barbara, where they lived for two decades in a custom-built house on Gibraltar Road overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Bob and Jean Sharp are survived by two adult children, Bruce Sharp and Christy Sharp. == Awards and honors == * The Hungaria asteroid 5426 Sharp, discovered by Carolyn Shoemaker at Palomar Observatory in 1985, was named in his honor. Naming citation was published on 17 March 1995 (). * On March 28, 2012, NASA named a mountain \\"Mount Sharp\\" on the planet Mars, in his honor. The mountain is located at the center of Gale crater, where in August of the same year the Mars rover Curiosity successfully landed.

The station, which was near Coelbren, was completed at the same time as the Swansea Vale and Neath and Brecon Joint Railway opened a seven-mile branch from here to Ynysygeinon in 1873. It was a key junction in the networks operated by the Midland, Neath and Brecon, and Great Western railway companies. Although the Welsh spelling of the nearby village is ‘Coelbren’, the anglicised version ‘Colbren’ was used for the station name and in railway literature. ==History== Background Colbren Junction was the outcome of a plan by the Midland Railway to reach the port of Swansea and it surrounding industries. The Midland wanted a route to Swansea that was independent of its two main competitors, the Great Western and London and North Western Railway. By 1867, the Neath and Brecon Railway had already opened a branch south from Brecon down the east side of the Tawe (or Swansea valley). This line, which provided the shortest route to Neath, crossed into the head of the parallel Dulais Valley near Coelbren. It then carried on westwards along the coast to Swansea via the Swansea and Neath Railway. Despite its direct route to the coast, the line avoided most of the Swansea Valley. Bypassing the areas around Abercrave near Ystradgynlais where there was heavy industry including coal mining and iron-making. It was for these commercial reasons that the branch from Colbren to Ynysygeinon was conceived. Ynysygeinon lay in the floor of the Swansea Valley, in which the Swansea Vale Railway had been operating (initially as a tramway) since 1816. The branch, which opened in 1873, was promoted as the \\"Swansea Vale and Neath and Brecon Junction Railway\\" even though Swansea Vale had merged with the Neath and Brecon in 1869. Colloquially it was known as the \\"Junction line\\". Operations pre-grouping railway map c.1914. Colbren Junction station, which opened in 1873 at the same time as the new route, was situated at the point where the original Neath and Brecon line met the new branch to Ynys-y-Geinon. The station consisted of three separate side platforms. As the Neath line was on a falling gradient, while the branch rose before commencing the descent to the Tawe valley, the branch's two platforms were built at a higher level to the single Neath side platform. Access between the upper and lower central platforms was by a short flight of steps. Although the Midland Railway had constructed a line into South Wales, it still needed to negotiate operating powers with several rival companies to make the route viable. These included the London and North Western Railway which reached Swansea via its Central Wales route in 1868. The Midland first leased, in 1874, and then acquired the Swansea Vale Railway in 1876; while exchanging running powers with the Neath and Brecon. A similar procedure was then employed with the Hereford, Hay and Brecon Railway; its running powers were passed to the Great Western. In doing so, the Midland was able to link with its main national network at Worcester. The outcome of these complex arrangements allowed the Midland to become the sole operator of the Brecon- Colbren-Ynys-y-Geinon-Swansea route, thus reducing the original main line between Colbren and Neath to the status of a branch. Until 1916 the Midland ran its trains beyond Brecon to Hereford, with parts of trains running directly to and from Worcester and Birmingham. Eventually these services were cut back to Brecon. Demise Location of the upper Swansea branch platforms at Colbren Junction, c.2012. Passenger traffic through Colbren would begin its decline following implementation of the railway groupings in 1922. The Midland and the London and North Western Railways (L&NWR;) each became part of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), while the Neath and Brecon (including the Ynys-y-Geinon branch) passed to the Great Western. These changes meant the original purpose of the Midland’s route into South Wales was now annulled because the new LMS company could now send all its South Wales traffic via the former L&NWR; Central Wales line. LMS passenger trains between Brecon and Swansea continued to stop at Colbren Junction until 1930. This service was then replaced by Brecon to Neath trains operated by the GWR. A short-lived passenger service continued to use the branch to Ynys-y-Geinon for a further two years; until finally ceasing in 1932. Subsequently both platforms on the Swansea branch fell into disuse except for occasional excursion trains. The passenger service between Brecon and Neath was finally withdrawn in October 1962; by now it had been reduced to one train per day in each direction. In 1966, the direct lines linking Neath and Swansea with Brecon via Colbren were deemed to be no longer viable. The Swansea branch to Ynys-y-Geinon ceased carrying local freight in 1967 wherein Colbren stopped being a junction with the removal of the branch. Freight traffic continued to pass through Colbren from Penwyllt quarries to Neath until 1977. Following the removal of the track through Colbren, the Neath and Brecon line now terminates at the coal washer at Onllwyn. Little remains at Colbren of the station or the junction; although surviving conifers indicate the alignment of the track of the former railway. ==Legacy== Plans have been proposed to extend National Cycle Route 43 northwards along the old trackbed from Colbren towards Brecon as far as the summit of the old line.Proposed Sustrans Map However a major landslip on one of the high embankments north of Penwyllt has held up the scheme. ==ServicesReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Disused railway stations in Powys Category:Rail junctions in Wales Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1873 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1962 ","title":"Colbren Junction railway station"},{"id":"35286554","text":"Aizanoi (), Latinized as Aezani, was an Ancient Greek city in western Anatolia. Located in what is now Çavdarhisar, Kütahya Province, its ruins are situated astride the River Penkalas, some above sea level. The city was an important political and economic centre in Roman times; surviving remains from the period include a well-preserved Temple of Zeus, unusual combined theatre- stadium complex, and macellum inscribed with the Price Edict of Diocletian. The city fell into decline in Late Antiquity. Later serving as a citadel, in 2012 the site was submitted for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List. ==History== Ruins of Aizanoi Temple of Zeus in Aizanoi Colonnaded street in Aizanoi Settlement in the area is known from the Bronze Age. The city may have derived its name from Azan, one of three sons of Arcas and the nymph Erato, legendary ancestors of the Phrygians. During the Hellenistic period the city changed hands between the Kingdom of Pergamum and the Kingdom of Bithynia, before being bequeathed to Rome by the former in 133 BC. It continued to mint its own coins. Its monumental buildings date from the early Empire to the 3rd century. Aezani was part of the Roman province of Phrygia Pacatiana. It became a Christian bishopric at an early stage, and its bishop Pisticus (or Pistus) was a participant at the First Council of Nicaea, the first ecumenical council, in 325. Pelagius was at a synod that Patriarch John II of Constantinople hastily organized in 518 and that condemned Severus of Antioch; he was also at the Second Council of Constantinople in 553. Gregory was at the Trullan Council of 692, John at the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, and Theophanes at both the Council of Constantinople (869) and the Council of Constantinople (879).Michel Lequien, Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus, Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 799-800Sophrone Pétridès, v. Aezani, in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de Géographie ecclésiastiques, vol. I, Paris 1909, coll. 670-671 The bishopric was at first a suffragan of Laodicea but, when Phrygia Pacatiana was divided into two provinces, it found itself a suffragan of Hierapolis, the capital of the new province of Phrygia Pacatiana II.Heinrich Gelzer, Ungedruckte und ungenügend veröffentlichte Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum, in: Abhandlungen der philosophisch-historische classe der bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 1901, p. 540, nº 321 and p. 558, nº 623.Darrouzès Jean, Listes épiscopales du concile de Nicée (787), in Revue des études byzantines, 33 (1975), p. 55. No longer a residential bishopric, Aezani is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 892 After the 7th century, Aezani fell into decline. Later, in Seljuk times, the temple hill was converted into a citadel () by Çavdar Tatars, after which the recent settlement of Çavdarhisar is named. The ruins of Aezani/Aizanoi were discovered by European travellers in 1824. Survey work in the 1830s and 1840s was followed by systematic excavation conducted by the German Archaeological Institute from 1926, resumed in 1970, and still ongoing. ==Ancient buildings and structures== Temple of Zeus Temple of Zeus The Temple of Zeus, situated upon a hill, was the city's main sanctuary. Ceramic finds indicate local habitation from the first half of the third millennium BC. According to a recent reading of the architrave inscription, construction of the temple began under Domitian.Kai Jes, Richard Posamentir, Michael Wörrle, Der Tempel des Zeus und seine Datierung, in Klaus Rheidt, ed. Aizanoi und Anatolien (von Zabern, 2010) Inscriptions document imperial assistance from Hadrian relating to the recovery of unpaid rents as well as the euergetism of Marcus Apuleius Eurykles. Later the Çavdar Tatars carved equestrian and battle scenes on the temple. The temple is pseudodipteral, with eight columns at the ends and fifteen along the sides (). It was damaged by the 1970 Gediz earthquake and has since been restored. Theatre and stadium Theatre-stadium complex South end of the stadium complex Aizanoi's theatre and stadium are built adjacent to each other and this combined complex is said to be unique in the ancient world. Separating the two is the stage building. Construction began after 160 A.D. and was complete by the mid-third century. Inscriptions again attest to the benefaction of M. Apuleius Eurycles. Baths Roman bath, Probably in the second half of the third century AD Two sets of thermae have been identified. The first, between the theatre-stadium and the temple, dates to the second half of the second century and includes a palaestra and marble furnishings. The second, in the north-east of the city, was built a century later; floor mosaics depict a satyr and maenad. Rebuilt a couple of centuries later, it served as the bishop's seat. Market Aizanoi is the first recorded place in the world where inflation was calculated and from there spread to other cities of the Roman Empire. Macellum, inscribed with the Price Edict of Diocletian A circular macellum dating to the second half of the second century is located in the south. In the fourth century it was inscribed with a copy of the Price Edict of Diocletian, dating to 301, an attempt to limit inflation resulting from debasement of the coinage. Colonnaded street and stoa Recent excavations have revealed the existence of a stoa, or covered walkway, dating to ca. 400 AD, and colonnaded street. A Temple of Artemis, dating to the time of Claudius (41-54), was demolished to make way for the colonnaded street which ran for and led to the sanctuary of Meter Steunene. Sanctuary of Meter Steunene A deep tunnel inside a cave, now collapsed, was dedicated to Meter Steunene (an Anatolian Earth Mother goddess). Cult figurines made of clay have been found in excavations, along with two round pits apparently used for animal sacrifice. Necropolis The city's large necropolis includes examples of door-shaped Phrygian tombstones. Inscriptions give the names of deceased or donor; accompanying decoration includes, for the tombs of men, bulls, lions and eagles, and for those of women, baskets of wool and a mirror. ==Museum of Kütahya== Some items from Aizanoi, among them a sarcophagus with an Amazonomachy, have been removed to the Archaeological Museum of Kütahya. ==See also== *Roman Asia *Roman architecture *List of World Heritage Sites in Turkey (Tentative list) ==References *Aizanoi Antique City (UNESCO) Category:Ancient Greek archaeological sites in Turkey Category:Former populated places in Turkey Category:History of Kütahya Province Category:Populated places in Phrygia Category:Roman Phrygia Category:Roman sites in Turkey Category:Roman towns and cities in Turkey Aezani Category:World Heritage Tentative List for Turkey ","title":"Aizanoi"},{"id":"35286556","text":"Namess Mimekh (in Hebrew נמס ממך) is the debut album of Israeli vocalist Omer Adam released in 2010.

Only two were built, the rival Avia B-34 being ordered instead. ==Design and development== In 1932, ČKD-Praga, the aircraft department of the Czechoslovak company Praga, entered a competition to design a new fighter for the Czechoslovak Air Force, with its design, the BH-44, competing against designs from Avia (the B-34Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 36.) and Letov (the Š-231Green and Swanborough 1994, pp. 334–335.). The BH-44 was a single-bay biplane of mixed construction, with wooden wings and a fabric covered, steel-tube fuselage. Powerplant was a single Praga ESV water-cooled V12 engine. The first prototype made its maiden flight on 19 July 1932. Performance was unimpressive, as the engine delivered only instead of the promised . A second prototype (sometimes called the EH-144), fitted with a supercharged Praga ESVK engine, flew in April 1934, but performance remained disappointing. The first prototype was therefore re- engined with a Rolls-Royce Kestrel VII, flying in this form on 30 October 1934, and as such was evaluated by the Czechoslovak Air Force as the E-44. The imported Kestrel engine worked poorly with the fuel used by the Air Force, however, and the type was rejected, the B-34 being purchased instead. ==Specifications (ESV engine, performance estimated) == Praga BH-44 3-view drawing from L'Aerophile February 1934 ==See alsoNotesReferences== *Green, William and Gordon Swanborough.

At the time, this was a colonial territory of the Spanish Empire. Damage occurred at several of the missions in the region of Pueblo de Los Ángeles, including Mission San Gabriel Arcángel and Mission San Juan Capistrano, where 40 parishioners were killed during the collapse of a church at an early morning service. Tree ring and paleoseismic evidence show that there is a strong likelihood that the earthquake originated along the Mojave segment of the San Andreas Fault near Wrightwood, but other faults have been suggested as the cause. Several studies in the 1980s placed the shock along the southern Newport–Inglewood Fault near the zone of highest reported intensity. This fault is near the coast and the most significant damage at the missions, but later work at trench sites along the San Andreas Fault excluded it for this large to very large shock. Dynamic rupture modelling made possible another proposal in the 2010s involving a dual rupture scenario with both the San Andreas and San Jacinto Fault Zones. Each of these studies worked with limited data, and the effects of the shock and various fault rupture details led to Mercalli intensities of VII (Very strong) to IX (Violent) being proposed. Magnitudes from 6.9 on the low end to 7.5 on the high end were also presented. ==Tectonic setting== The primary tectonic feature in California is the strike-slip San Andreas (SAF) system of faults that form part of the diffuse Pacific–North American plate boundary. This transform fault trends south-southeast through much of northern and central California, but turns more southeasterly at the southern end of the California Coast Ranges at a prominent restraining bend. Southeast of this bend the SAF borders the Mojave Desert then bisects the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains at Cajon Pass, where the active San Jacinto Fault Zone diverges from the SAF. The San Jacinto Mountains and the Salton Sea lie between the two faults as they continue to the southeast towards the Mexico–United States border. The Newport–Inglewood Fault, a part of the San Andreas system that is positioned near the coast along the western extremity of the Los Angeles Basin, is a discontinuous strike-slip fault similar to the San Jacinto Fault. ==Earthquake== The Newport-Inglewood-Rose Canyon Fault Zone The San Andreas Fault The San Jacinto Fault Zone Source fault In the 1980s several seismologists attributed the source of the event to the southern Newport–Inglewood Fault due to its proximity to the zone of greatest damage at Mission San Juan Capistrano. The northern portion of the fault was excluded as a potential source due to a lack of damage at San Buenaventura. Other more distant sources have also been proposed, including the Mojave segment of the SAF to the north of San Juan Capistrano, substantiated by tree distress evidence preserved in tree rings along the fault zone and paleoseismic evidence in an investigative trench at Pallet Creek. Another scenario was proposed after a researcher noted the great distance between the SAF and the zone of damage near the coast. After a paleoseismic investigation and simulations, it was proposed that a joint rupture of both the SAF and the San Jacinto Fault Zone to the southeast more closely matched the damage pattern than a SAF-only rupture. Newport–Inglewood Fault In support of the southern Newport–Inglewood Fault as the source, Toppozada & Real 1981 presented a simple isoseismal map with one elongated ring oriented northwest–southeast roughly parallel to the coastline and centered on the fault. The single isoseismal (a line depicting an area of equal intensity) shows the intensity VII (Very strong) boundary for the event, which is an ellipse that includes Mission San Juan Capistrano, Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, and Mission San Fernando Rey de España at the extreme northwest end. From a modern-day perspective, this intensity level covers all of Orange County, most of southern Los Angeles County, and insignificant portions of San Bernardino, Riverside, and San Diego Counties. After analyzing the intensity data that were derived from the mission's minimal reports and by modeling ground conditions and known faults, Evernden & Thompson 1985 also singled out the southern Newport–Inglewood Fault as the source. San Andreas Fault Influenced by the work of several dendrochronologists and a seismologist who examined trauma to trees near Wrightwood, Toppozada et al. 2002 came about in support of the SAF as the source. Jacoby, Sheppard, & Sieh 1988 gained a more thorough understanding of the most recent events and a potential rupture length of the SAF by investigating damage to trees, which been associated with intensity VIII (Severe) shaking within several kilometers of a source fault. Seventy trees were examined and nine of the trees along a section experienced some form of trauma beginning in 1813, including two with crown loss. All were within of the fault. Other sources for the damage were ruled out, including disease, lightning, wind, and fire. Severe shaking was also excluded because trees outside of this narrow zone would also have similar effects. The researchers' theory was that right-lateral displacement on the SAF had damaged their root systems. San Andreas and San Jacinto Faults By the 2010s, the shift of attention from the Newport–Inglewood Fault to the SAF was cemented, with numerous other paleoseismic investigations validating that slip along the SAF, possibly as far north as Elizabeth Lake, was responsible for the event. Damage Several of the Roman Catholic missions in the area experienced heavy damage. The bell structure at Mission San Gabriel Arcángel collapsed and at Mission San Juan Capistrano the Great Stone Church was destroyed and forty Native Americans were killed as the earthquake happened during the first service. The service was being held on a Tuesday, for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception celebration, which is universally celebrated every December 8. Intensity shows the most conservative estimates for the intensity of the event, with Mission San Luis Rey and Mission San Diego both indicating that the shock was felt only, and no clarification of whether it was weak, light, or moderate. Well away from the proposed epicenter, the San Bernardino Valley may have experienced intensity VI (Strong) shaking, and a maximum intensity of VII was listed for Mission San Juan Capistrano, Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, and Mission San Fernando Rey de España. Mission San Buenaventura lay outside the ring, but is annotated with possibly also having experienced intensity VII effects. and the National Geophysical Data Center's Significant Earthquake Database both show a maximum intensity of VIII (Severe), but neither correlate intensity to location. The NGDC's Earthquake Intensity Database indicates that a maximum of IX (Violent) was experienced at San Gabriel and San Juan Capistrano. ==See also== * List of earthquakes in California * List of historical earthquakes == References  External links == * Wrightwood earthquake – Southern California Earthquake Center * San Andreas May Have Had Help Triggering a Historic Earthquake – Smithsonian 1812 Category:1812 earthquakes Category:1812 in Alta California Category:1810s in California Category:History of San Bernardino County, California Category:History of Southern California Earthquake Category:December 1812 events Category:1812 in New Spain Category:Spanish missions in California ","title":"1812 San Juan Capistrano earthquake"},{"id":"35286639","text":"The 1936–37 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan in intercollegiate basketball during the 1936–37 season. The team compiled a 16–4 record, and 9–3 against Big Ten Conference opponents. The team scored 741 points in 20 games for an average of 37.1 points per game – the highest point total and scoring per game in school history up to that time. Michigan finished in third place in the Big Ten. The team opened the season with a 61–12 victory over Michigan Normal (now known as Eastern Michigan University), setting a new scoring record at Yost Field House. During the winter break, the team traveled to Seattle, Washington, to play three games against the University of Washington. Team captain Johnny Gee (who later played professional baseball and basketball), was unavailable to play during the west coast trip due to a broken nose. Michigan won two out of the three games in Seattle.1937 Michiganensian, page 282. Franklin \\"Cappy\\" Cappon was in his sixth year as the team's coach. Cappon had played basketball and football at Michigan from 1919 to 1923. As a senior, he was awarded the Western Conference Medal for all-around excellence in both athletics and academics. After seven seasons as Michigan's head coach, Cappon served as the head basketball coach from 1938 to 1961 at Princeton University, where he mentored Butch van Breda Kolff, Bill Bradley and Frank Deford. He compiled a combined record of 340–242 at Michigan and Princeton and was inducted into the Helms Foundation College Basketball Hall of Fame in 1957. John \\"Jake\\" Townsend, a six-foot, four inch center from Indiana, was the team leading scorer for three straight seasons. He scored 154 points during the 1935–36 season, 191 points during the 1936–37 season, and 226 points during the 1937-38 season. Townsend's 191 points during the 1936–37 season broke the school's single season scoring record of 181 points set by Arthur Karpus in the 1918–19 season. His career total of 571 points also broke Karpus's career scoring record of 338 points. Townsend was selected as a unanimous All-Big Ten player at the end of the 1936–37 season and later played professional basketball in the National Basketball League for the Indianapolis Kautskys, Oshkosh All-Stars and Rochester Royals. ==Schedule== { width=\\"650\\" - align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;color:blue;\\"  DateOpponent  Score  Result  Location - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Dec. 7, 1936Michigan Normal61–12WinYost Field House, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Dec. 12, 1936Michigan State34–21WinYost Field House, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Dec. 21, 1936Washington40–23LossSeattle, Washington - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Dec. 22, 1936Washington34–32WinSeattle, Washington - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Dec. 23, 1936Washington39–33WinSeattle, Washington - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Jan. 1, 1937Toledo41–33WinToledo, Ohio - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Jan. 5, 1937Butler36–27WinIndianapolis, IN - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Jan. 9, 1937Purdue37–26LossLafayette, IN - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Jan. 11, 1937Northwestern34–31WinYost Field House, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Jan. 16, 1937Wisconsin41–31WinMadison, WI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Jan. 18, 1937Chicago35–29WinHenry Crown Field House, Chicago, IL - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Jan. 23, 1937Ohio State37–32LossYost Field House, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Jan. 25, 1937Chicago32–19WinYost Field House, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Feb. 13, 1937Michigan State38–31WinEast Lansing, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Feb. 15, 1937Indiana55 31WinYost Field House, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Feb. 20, 1937Northwestern34–32WinEvanston, IL - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Feb. 22, 1937Purdue31–16WinYost Field House, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Feb. 27, 1937Ohio State38–24WinColumbus, OH - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" March 1, 1937Indiana31–27LossBloomington, IN - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" March 6, 1937Wisconsin41–27WinYost Field House, Ann Arbor, MI - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" } ==Scoring statistics== { width=\\"650\\" - align=\\"center\\" style=\\"background:yellow;color:blue;\\"  PlayerGames  Field goals  Free throws  Points Points per game - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" John \\"Jake\\" Townsend206561-961919.6 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Johnny Gee186030-491508.3 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Herman Fishman195123-381256.6 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" William Barclay203228-41924.6 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Matt Patanelli203318-29844.2 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Edmund Thomas19203-15432.3 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Daniel Smick13111-8231.8 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Leo Beebe1645-9130.8 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Manuel Slavin430-161.5 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Richard Long1121-250.5 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Payne111-233.0 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Louis Levine110-022.0 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Richard Joslin110-022.0 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Ferris Jennings1010-120.2 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" William Lane400-000.0 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" Totals20285171-29274037.1 - align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"\\" } ==Coaching staff== *Franklin Cappon - coach *Assistant coaches: Bennie Oosterbaan *Fielding H.

The election used the eight wards, created as a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with each ward electing three or four Councillors using the single transferable vote system a form of proportional representation, with 29 Councillors being elected. The 2007 Election saw the Scottish National Party lose majority control on the Council. In their stead the Angus Alliance took over the leadership of the Council made up of all parties and groupings opposed to the SNP. Two independent councillors (one elected in 2007, the other elected at a by-election in 2011) remained outside the Angus Alliance. The 2012 election saw the SNP gain 2 additional seats and regain their overall majority on the Council. Independents also increased their overall numbers and became the second largest grouping while all other parties; the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, Labour and the Scottish Liberal Democrats lost seats. The Conservative and Unionist Party are the second largest political party represented on the council. Following the election the Scottish National Party formed the administration on the Council.

Danish: kommune) from 1,098 to 277 and the number of counties (sing. Danish: amt) from 25 to 14. The reform also abolished the last legal privileges of the market towns (sing. Danish købstad). The 1970 reform was followed by another municipal reform in 2007, namely the Structure Reform. This reform would further reduce the number of municipalities in Denmark, and replace the counties with regions. ==History== In 1841, a law provided for the establishment of 1,021 parish municipalities (sing. Danish: Sognekommune) for the first time, and their numbers increased over the years, as did the number of købstadskommuner (Singular Danish: Købstadskommune). The parish municipalities belonged to 24 counties while the market towns were under direct control of the Ministry of the Interior. Originally the municipalities held only small areas of responsibility. During the 20th century, they were granted responsibility for the hospital service for the non-urban population. In 1958, interior minister Søren Olesen began what would eventually lead to the 1970 Municipal Reform. The number of municipalities peaked in 1965 at 1,345: there were 1,257 parish and 88 market city municipalities, with Copenhagen and Frederiksberg included in the latter total.Politikens bog om Danskerne og Verden.

At the time of the reform the number of municipalities had already been reduced to 1,098. ==Scope== Throughout the 16 years of gradually cutting the number of municipalities, they were reduced from well over 1,000 to 275. The number of counties was reduced from 25 to 14. The concept of market towns was abandoned, with Copenhagen and Frederiksberg being the only municipalities not part of a county after the reform. 1974 adjustment The last bits of the reform were not fully implemented until 1 April 1974 when the number of municipalities was further reduced to 275. * Store Magleby and Dragør parishes were merged to become Dragør Municipality * Sengeløse Municipality was merged into Høje-Taastrup Municipality ==References== Category:1970 in Denmark Category:Government of Denmark Category:Reform in Denmark ","title":"1970 Danish Municipal Reform"},{"id":"35286719","text":"Otto Schulz-Kampfhenkel (27 August 1910 in Buckow – 21 August 1989) was a German geographer, explorer, writer and film producer. ==Biography== At the age of 23 Schulz-Kampfhenkel made an expedition to Liberia.

Sardy (Marilyn Manson, Slayer) and Joe Zook (Weezer, Modest Mouse). The deluxe version features bonus tracks (digital download only) produced by Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme. The term \\"Lex Hives\\" is a phrase derived from the ancient Roman practice of enacting a system or body of laws and accepting them as a standard. It became the last album from the band to feature bassist Dr. Matt Destruction as he left due to health reasons in late 2013 and was replaced by Randy bassist Johan Gustafsson, under the stage name The Johan and Only.Gustafsson replaces Bernvall in 2013 as Bernvall leaves for health reasons rollingstone.com Retrieved:2014-03-29 ==Background== After recording two albums (Tyrannosaurus Hives, The Black and White Album) for the Universal Music Group's Interscope label, the band did not want to extend the deal, and so the band found themselves as free agents. The Hives responded by going independent for their fifth album. Lex Hives was self-funded and self-produced, and has been issued on the band's own Disques Hives imprint. As for why the band took five years between albums, frontman Howlin' Pelle Almqvist noted the group toured for nearly three years after The Black and White Album, but added that self-producing an album with a five- piece band is not the quickest of ways to reach a consensus. \\"We thought it would be faster if we produced it ourselves as opposed to scheduling it with someone who’s busy 24-7, 365 days per year,\\" Almqvist said. \\"Rather than squeeze in some studio time, we could go into the studio whenever we wanted. It turns out that having five producers who have an equal say of everything isn’t that fast. You’d think we could have guessed that in advance.\\" For promotion, The Hives initiated a contest on social networking website Facebook on 23 March 2012. A news update on their official website revealed the song titles on 12 tracks however they were purposely jumbled up. Fans had to post their guesses as to what they thought the tracks were called on the band's official Facebook page. It stated that the first person to unscramble all the song titles correctly would \\"receive a phone call from The Hives.\\" The band announced the grand prize winner and 17 runners-up on their Facebook page on 6 April 2012. ==Reception== The album debuted at number 7 on the Swedish chart, 20 on the Swiss chart, 38 on the Austrian chart, 38 on the Australian chart and 53 on the Canadian Albums Chart. It was also number 1 on the Swedish iTunes chart and number 25 on the separate Australian digital album chart. The album received generally favorable reviews from critics. ==Track listing== ;Notes :1. Both bonus tracks (13, 14) are cover songs, but are directly related to one of The Hives' members in some way. \\"High School Shuffle\\" is a cover of an Alex Carole and The Crush song that was produced by Chris Dangerous (drums). \\"Insane\\" is a cover of The Dragtones' original, and Vigilante Carlstroem (guitar) is a member of that band. :2. \\"Go Right Ahead\\" has songwriting also credited to Jeff Lynne since the band got permission to include a similar riff to Electric Light Orchestra's \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\". ==Personnel== The Hives *Howlin' Pelle Almqvist - vocals, vocoder *Nicholaus Arson - lead guitar, backing vocals *Vigilante Carlstroem – rhythm guitar, backing vocals *Dr. Matt Destruction – bass guitar *Chris Dangerous – drums Additional musicians and personnel * Gustav Bendt - saxophone * Per Ruskträsk Johansson - saxophone *Jonas Kullhammar - saxophone * Henrik Alsér - engineer * Michael Ilbert - engineer * Karl Larsson - engineer * Dagge Lundquist - engineer * Johan Gustavsson - engineer * Kalle Gustavsson - engineer * Justin Smith - engineer * Janne Hansson - engineer * Linn Fijal - assistant engineer * Jeff Lynne - composer * Stephen Marcussen - mastering * Andrew Scheps - mixing * Joe Zook - mixing ==References External links == * Lex Hives Category:2012 albums Category:The Hives albums Category:Self-released albums ","title":"Lex Hives"},{"id":"35286758","text":"A-Mobile is the second mobile phone operator of Abkhazia behind Aquafon, both in number of subscriptions and in age. ==History== A-Mobile started its operations on November 25, 2006 in Sukhumi.

The urbanization of the territory started in 1925 with the connection of different tram lines. The development of public transportation encouraged the construction of numerous tenements along major thoroughfares such as Queen Mary Road, which was then the Snowdon Junction terminus.Site web de la Ville de Montréal : Grand répertoire du patrimoine bâti de Montréal In the 1960s, the Decarie Expressway trench was dug, splitting the road in two, which increased vehicular traffic in the Snowdon neighbourhood. In 1981, the Snowdon metro station opened near the site of the old tram terminus. This station is an important transit crossroad because it serves two Metro lines, the Orange Line and the Blue Line, in addition to many buses.

She was the sole named class plaintiff in the federal sex discrimination lawsuit that opened the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) to women firefighters. When she won the lawsuit in 1982, she and 40 other women became FDNY firefighters. == Early childhood == Berkman grew up in Minneapolis, where as a child she became acutely aware of gender preference in favor of boys. Her application to Little League was turned down solely on the basis of her gender. == Career == Brenda Berkman was enrolled in her third year of law school when the New York City Fire Department announced that women could take the exam to become firefighters in 1977. After passing the written portion of the exam, Berkman and 89 other women subsequently failed the physical portion. It was stated by an official that their physical test was “the most difficult the department had ever administered, [and] was designed more to keep women out than to accurately assess job-related skills.” After Berkman's requests for a fairer test were ignored, she filed an ultimately successful class- action lawsuit: Brenda Berkman, et al. v. The City of New York (1982). A new test was created in which standards were changed so the test was job-related and Brenda with 40 other women passed to enter the fire academy in 1982. (See Brenda Berkman, et al. v. The City of New York, CV-79-1813, 536 F. Supp. 177 (E.D.N.Y. 1982), aff’d Berkman v. City of New York, 705 F.2d 584 (2d Cir. 1983.)) Less than a year later Berkman was fired for alleged lack of physical ability, while her performance was consistently in the top tier of every task the fire department had given women. When she had returned to her firehouse on the Lower East Side to collect her belongings, the male firefighters wouldn't speak to her. As she exited in silence, they began clapping. In 1983 Brenda Berkman and Zaida Gonzalez sued to be reinstated. Judge Sifton's 56-page ruling was highly critical of the Fire Department, which the judge said had failed lamentably to prepare its officers and members for the extraordinary task of integrating women into its previously all-male ranks. While serving as firefighters, the two women were subjected to extensive sexual harassment, the judge said. The struggle of women to join the FDNY, and Berkman's part in it, was featured in a 2006 PBS documentary called Taking The Heat. Berkman was the founder of the United Women Firefighters in 1982, an organization for women in the FDNY. She was its first president and then elected president again multiple times until 1996. Lieutenant Berkman was off duty when the first plane hit the World Trade Center on September 11. She ran to the nearest firehouse and arrived at the site just as the North Tower collapsed. Berkman spent the rest of 9/11 and many weeks following looking for survivors and remains. Most 9/11 accounts reinforced the notion of heroes as men, often referring to firefighters as “firemen’ instead of the gender-neutral term and paid little attention to female workers at the scene. Her push to have women recognized for their contributions eventually led to the production of a video titled “The Women at Ground Zero.”Women Firefighters’ Strategies For Advancement In The Fire Service: Breaking Down Barriers In Gender-Based Occupations, Barbara R. Russo Her experience was also featured in the book Women at Ground Zero: stories of courage and compassion. She retired in 2006 at the rank of Captain. Berkman has remained an outspoken advocate for gender equality. == Awards == * Susan B.

She drew and created the stone lithograph print “2001”, a self-portrait depicting a bent over figure, covering her head and moving away as if under attack from above. In 2012 a self-portrait she created was exhibited at the 9/11 Decade Exhibit at the Westbeth Sculpture Gallery Annex. The series of stone lithograph images she drew and printed over three years (2015-2017) is titled “Thirty-Six Views of One World Trade Center.\\" “Thirty-six Views” documents both the rebuilding and the memories of the World Trade Center site.

Yasuaki Uwabe, a 35-year-old former architect, drove a car into Shimonoseki Station and then stabbed passers-by at random, killing five people and injuring 10 others, before being arrested at the scene. Uwabe was sentenced to death in 2002 and executed in 2012. ==Perpetrator== Yasuaki Uwabe Yasuaki Uwabe ( Uwabe Yasuaki) was born in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi Prefecture, the son of Masakazu and Keiko Uwabe who were both teachers. He achieved excellent grades at school until he reached high school, failing his university entrance exam the first time but passing it the second time. In 1989, Uwabe graduated from the Faculty of Engineering at the prestigious Kyushu University with a degree in architecture. After graduation, he worked in the office for an architecture firm in Fukuoka until 1991, when he received his certification as a first-class architect. Uwabe worked in the office for another architectural firm, but soon quit due to suffering from social phobias. Uwabe married in 1993 and opened his own architectural firm, but quit in 1997 due to his social phobias. As he ran out of money, he received a loan to buy a light truck and began work in the delivery service industry, a job which did not require interpersonal relationships. At the same time, he began to increasingly isolate himself, and got a divorce in June 1999. His delivery company was successful until September that year, when his truck was lost in a flood due to Typhoon Bart, and his loan was recalled. He asked his parents to pay for the loan but they refused. ==Attack== On 29 September 1999, at around 4:25 pm, Uwabe, who was still working in the transportation industry, drove a rented car into the east entrance of Shimonoseki Station hitting at least seven people, two of whom died at the scene. As the car got stuck, he exited the vehicle brandishing a kitchen knife and progressed up to the second platform on the second floor, stabbing a further seven people on the stairs and platform. Uwabe was eventually overpowered by a station worker and an officer of the railway police, and arrested at the scene. ==Aftermath== After his arrest, Uwabe said that \\"No matter what I did, it never turned out well, which made me bitter toward society\\". He also stated that he decided to use a car in order to \\"kill more people\\". Looking back on his early life, Uwabe described how, after graduating as a first-class architect from a national university of Japan, he found it hard to open his own design office and began to blame his parents and society for his frustration. Reportedly, on the morning of 29 September, Uwabe asked his father to buy him a new truck for his business but was refused. He said that he was also motivated by another crime in Japan three weeks earlier, when a 23-year-old man stabbed two people to death and injured six others in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. Uwabe underwent a psychiatric evaluation which concluded that he suffered from paranoid personality disorder, and his defence lawyer argued that he believed he was being unfairly persecuted by society. However, the prosecution argued that he was sane and fully responsible for his crimes after a second psychiatric evaluation. He was judged by the Yamaguchi District Court and found guilty of all charges and sentenced to death in September 2002. He appealed his sentence to the Hiroshima High Court, the highest court in the Chūgoku region, but judge Toshikazu Obuchi upheld the sentence in a ruling in June 2005. Uwabe filed an appeal to the Supreme Court, but a committee headed by Isao Imai upheld the original death sentence and the ruling by the Hiroshima High Court in July 2008. Minister of Justice Toshio Ogawa signed Uwabe's execution warrant on 27 March 2012, and he was executed by hanging at the Hiroshima Detention House two days later. He was one of several prisoners on Japan's death row to be executed on 29 March 2012. Uwabe's attack led to controversy over the welfare scheme for victims of crime in Japan. Survivors and the families of those killed in the car ramming were entitled to a vehicle insurance payout from the rental car's insurance, while those of the knife attack were not and could only receive payments from the government's victim compensation scheme, which was deemed to be insufficient. In 2001, the Japanese government passed reforms to improve the scope and amount of compensation paid to victims of crime. Shimonoseki Station's East Gate was damaged in Uwabe's attack and soon repaired, but was destroyed in a major arson attack on 7 January 2006 and has since been significantly remodelled. ==References== Category:Massacres in Japan Category:Massacres in 1999 Category:1999 crimes in Japan Category:1999 road incidents Category:Road incidents in Japan Category:Mass stabbings in Japan Category:Knife attacks Category:1999 murders in Asia Category:1990s murders in Japan Category:Mass murder in Japan ","title":"Shimonoseki Station massacre"},{"id":"35287028","text":"Toimi is an unincorporated community in Lake County, Minnesota, United States.

He was the Frank Baird, Jr. Professor of History at Harvard University. ==Education and academic career== Kishlansky was born in Brooklyn. He completed his undergraduate degree at the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1970. He proceeded to graduate study under David Underdown at Brown University, receiving his M.A. in 1972 and his PhD in 1977. His PhD thesis was titled \\"The Emergence of Radical Politics in the English Revolution\\". From 1975 to 1991 he taught at the University of Chicago, successively as instructor and professor. From 1990 to 1991 he was a member of the Committee on Social Thought. He was a visiting professor at Northwestern University in 1983 and was the Mellon Visiting Professor in the Humanities and Social Sciences at the California Institute of Technology in 1990–91. In 1991 he became a professor at Harvard University and from 1998 to 2001 served as Associate Dean of the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences. He was editor of the Journal of British Studies from 1984 to 1991 and editor-in- chief of History Compass from 2003 to 2009. Kevin Sharpe, Conrad Russell and John Morrill pioneered the revisionist interpretation of early Stuart history. Unlike previous scholars who had seen the Civil Wars of the 1640s as stemming from the growth of ideological opposition to the Stuart monarchs over the previous half-century, the revisionists argued that an ideological consensus had prevailed at least until the early 1620s. This consensus, in their view, was unsettled in the late 1620s and afterwards by religious disputes and by the crown's fiscal problems. The revisionist school sought to counter interpretations of the English Civil Wars that had been advanced by historians influenced by Marxist and Whiggish models of historical development. Kishlansky advanced his interpretation in an article in 1977 in The Journal of Modern HistoryMark Kishlansky, \\"The Emergence of Adversary Politics in the Long Parliament,\\" Journal of Modern History, vol. 49 (1977), pp. 617–40. and in two books, The Rise of the New Model Army (1979) and Parliamentary Selection (1986). In the early 1990s Kishlansky became involved in a controversy with the University of Cambridge historian, John Adamson. The controversy began in 1990 when Kishlansky published an article in the Historical Journal criticising Adamson's use of sources. Kishlansky, contending that Adamson had overstated the influence of Viscount Saye and Sele in the parliamentary politics of the mid-1640s and had misrepresented the original sources he had analysed, entitled his article \\"Saye What?\\"Mark A. Kishlansky, \\"Saye What?\\" Historical Journal, vol. 33 (1990), pp. 917–937. Adamson responded with an article entitled \\"Politics and the Nobility in Civil-War England\\"J.S.A. Adamson, \\"Politics and the Nobility in Civil-War England,\\" Historical Journal, vol. 34 (1991), pp. 231–255. exposing Kishlansky's own archival source problems and Kishlansky responded reiterating his case with an article titled \\"Saye No More\\".Mark A. Kishlansky, \\"Saye No More,\\" Journal of British Studies, vol. 30 (1991), pp. 399–448. This was followed by an exchange of letters in the Times Literary Supplement in 1992, provoked by a review written by Lawrence Stone that mentioned the controversy. A series of historians commented on the debate in the letters pages of the TLS, including Conrad Russell, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Kishlansky and Adamson. This was covered in the British press, with The Times describing it as a \\"fierce high table row\\"The Times (London), February 21, 1992. and The Independent calling it a \\"most uncivil war\\".The Independent (London), March 1, 1992. The Sunday Times described it as a \\"historians' brawl\\" that had \\"shocked the academic community\\".The Sunday Times (London), February 23, 1992. In addition to his publications on Stuart history, Kishlansky co-authored a number of textbooks, most notably Civilization in the West (with Patrick Geary and Patricia O'Brien), Societies and Cultures in World History (with Patrick Geary, Patricia O'Brien and R. Bin Wong), and The Unfinished Legacy (with Patrick Geary and Patricia O'Brien). He was a consulting editor for Prentice- Hall and served as a consulting editor for Longman Publications (2006–08), HarperCollins (1990–96), Scott, Foresman Co. (1987–89) and George Allen & Unwin (1984–86). Kishlansky died on May 19, 2015, at age 66. ==Recognition== Kishlansky was a fellow of the Massachusetts Historical Society and the Royal Historical Society. He held research fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1983–84 and the Newberry Library in 1987–88. He received a Distinguished Alumni Award from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1989. He held the Fletcher Jones Research Fellowship at the Huntington Library in 1990. He held the Walter Channing Cabot Fellowship for 1995–96. ==NotesPublications== *Charles I: An Abbreviated Life (Penguin, 2014). *The Rise of the New Model Army (Cambridge University Press, 1979). *Parliamentary Selection: Social and Political Choice in Early Modern England (Cambridge University Press, 1986). *Political Culture and Cultural Politics in Early Modern England, ed. with Susan Amussen (Manchester University Press, 1995). *A Monarchy Transformed: Britain, 1603-1714 (The Penguin History of Britain, vol. 6, 1996). *\\"The Sale of Crown Lands and the Spirit of the Revolution,\\" Economic History Review, 2nd. ser., vol. 29 (1976), pp. 125–30. *\\"The Emergence of Adversary Politics in the Long Parliament,\\" Journal of Modern History, vol. 49 (1977), pp. 617–40.

The roof peaked in five pyramids, one on each corner of the house and one in the centrehttp://justbackdated.blogspot.com/2017/09/keith-moons-living- arrangements.html over a large sunken lounge. It featured French windows, a master ensuite, a study and the lounge. The house was semi-transparent, minimalist modern style pioneered by public galleries and recording studios (such as Tittenhurst Park), and included futuristic appliances and labour- saving devices. The unusual roof emphasised post-war abstractism as opposed to art deco simplicity. The grounds included an extensive lawn, wooded areas and a large pond. The town centre was about away, beyond the foot of the knoll, stretching down as far as the Thames, along which some members of The Who had homes and mainly in their in early years performed, particularly at the hotel/dance venue, The Eel Pie at Eel Pie Island, Twickenham, London. ==History== The house was reportedly named Tara after the mansion in Gone With The Wind.https://www.surreylife.co.uk/out-about/rock-stars-and-surrey-from- john-lennon-and-keith-moon-to-eric-clapton-1-3206121 It was built by Peter Collison, film director of The Italian Job (1969) who blew up a Victorian home to film the demolition and built the contemporary home in its place.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r06_CAAAQBAJ&pg;=PT25&lpg;=PT25&dq;=Tara+italian+job+director&source;=bl&ots;=AbWE9i6eoi&sig;=ACfU3U2UCztElThLehPOCf6UO_qKnuE0_A&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwiL_8SskKroAhXllFwKHVCdBTYQ6AEwD3oECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q;=Tara%20italian%20job%20director&f;=false In 1971 Keith Moon purchased the property from Collison for £65,000 (), and he and his wife Kim Kerrigan launched an eccentric and extravagant open-house social life based at the home. \\"People would come to deliver a pizza or do a mural and be there for weeks,\\" reported author Richard Barnes.

In 1983 Ilona Copen founded NYIBC, with Igor Youskevitch as first artistic director, in order to fill a void and satisfy a need in the global dance ecosystem. Other international ballet competitions existed, but New York City, considered a dance capital of the world, did not have its own. NYIBC's mission was to discover the world's finest young ballet dancers, provide them with an extraordinary educational, mentoring and cultural experience, advance their careers by producing performances in New York City, and promote international understanding and goodwill. NYIBC's unique format in the ballet world provided its participants with a fair level playing field, and distinguished it from all other ballet competitions. For the three-week intensive program of dance education and professional training, all 48 dancers from around the world received full scholarships to participate. The dancers learned the same choreographic version of the pas de deux and contemporary duet chosen for each progressive round. Prior to arriving to New York City, none of the dancers knew the choice of repertoire, thus increasing the fairness of the competition. The only previously planned choreography was the individual solo, performed during the second round. The tone of the three-week-long competition, therefore, was much more similar to that of a professional company than a competition. The dancers came together from across the world and learned previously unknown choreography together. At the end, the performance rounds and gala took place over the course of five days, in the Rose Theater at Jazz at Lincoln Center. Citing financial difficulties, the competition was ended on August 23, 2014. ==Process== NYIBC participants lived and worked together during their three-week stay in New York. This gave them the opportunity to see what was happening technically around the world and learn from each other in a highly collaborative atmosphere. The competition began with two weeks of technique classes and the learning and rehearsing of two classical and one contemporary pas de deux. The repertoire, chosen from a rich dance heritage, was taught by world-renowned teachers and coaches. It included the \\"Black Swan Pas de Deux\\" from Swan Lake, A Choreographic Offering by José Limón, the \\"Act III Pas de Deux\\" from Coppélia, the Fourth Movement duet from Aureole by Paul Taylor, and the Valse from Les Sylphides. During the performance rounds, the participants performed for the public and the panel of judges. The first round was classical pas de deux, the second round a contemporary pas de deux and individual solos, and the final round was another classical partnering piece. Although they applied as couples, dancers were judged on an individual basis. All participants performed exclusively with the partner with whom they applied. Eliminations were made after each round. Dancers had to participate in all rounds unless both partners were eliminated and, if chosen, perform in the Gala Performance. ==Awards== The jury, composed of leading artistic figures from different countries, awarded Gold, Silver and Bronze medals accompanied by monetary prizes. In addition, the jury gave awards for special artistic achievements. Igor Youskevitch Award In 1996, American Ballet Theatre and NYIBC created an award to commemorate the life and work of NYIBC's first Artistic Director, Igor Youskevitch. The Igor Youskevitch Award was a one-year contract to an NYIBC participant of American Ballet Theatre's choosing. Arpino Award In the spring of 2004, NYIBC and the Joffrey Ballet memorialized an agreement under which the Joffrey would offer a one-year contract to an NYIBC participant.

In 1922, aged 19, he emigrated to San Francisco, arriving with just $2. He worked as a janitor at the Palace Hotel and then as a cook nearby, where Monk Young, his boss, was unable to pronounce his name, and called him bimbo instead (Italian for \\"boy\\"), and the nickname stuck. ==Bimbo's 365 Club== Bimbo's 365 Club In 1931, the 365 Club, 365 Market Street, was opened as a speakeasy and after-hours gambling club, owned by Young and managed by Giuntoli. It soon became the most popular illicit drinking establishment in town. Musical artists and dancers showcased their work, including a young Rita Hayworth dancing in the chorus line. An optical illusion achieved by mirrors made the large fish tank above the bar appear to have a nude woman swimming in it. Bar patrons marveled at Dolfina, \\"the Girl in the Fishbowl\\". In 1936, he employed Victor Rosellini, his wife's younger brother, in front of house. Rosellini went on to run several restaurants in Seattle, and later became president of the National Restaurant Association. In 1943, Giuntoli became a naturalized US citizen. In 1950 or 1951, Giuntoli, by that time sole owner of the 365 Club, purchased 1025 Columbus Avenue and moved his club there. As of 2014, the club is still there, owned and run by his grandson, Michael Cerchiai, who celebrated his eight birthday there with a Batman-themed cake, while Smokey Robinson played live. ==Personal life== In 1928, Giuntoli married Emilia Rosellini (December 26, 1908, Tacoma, WA - November 2, 1989, San Francisco), and they had two daughters: * Diana Isola Cerchiai (born March 18, 1929, San Jose). She has 5 children. * Yvonne Fine Sangiacomo (born February 11, 1932, San Francisco). Her husband, Angelo Sangiacomo, is a real estate developer, and together they own about 50 apartment buildings in San Francisco. Their seven children all attended L'Ecole Notre Dame des Victoires in San Francisco.http://www.bal-de- paris.org/histoire.html Giuntoli died in San Francisco on July 25, 1992.

Alongside The Annual it is one of Ministry of Sound's better-known compilation album series. Not the first ever DJ mix album released, or at least first to chart in the UK. ==History== The Ministry of Sound record label began in 1993, and the first release on it was The Sessions Volume One, a 12-track mix compiled and mixed by Tony Humphries. It was critically acclaimed and more Sessions were released to critical acclaim and even charted higher in the UK Compilation Chart. Sessions 5, by Masters at Work, was the first double album in the series and every volume since has either been a double or triple album. In 1995, 1997, 1999 (and two later editions in 2003, and one in 2011) is the Late Night Sessions series. The first edition from 1995 was mixed by DJ Harvey. In about 2000, the Sessions series was a joint release between Ministry of Sound and Defected Records. This lasted for volumes 10-15. Volume 12 was the last of the original series of Sessions. It had become more of an Defected release than a Ministry of Sound release evidenced by the fact the Ministry of Sound's logo wasn't even present on the twelfth Sessions cover. Volumes 13, 14 and 15 actually didn't feature a number in the title. After focusing on the spin-off series Chillout Sessions, which ran initially for 8 volumes between 2001 and 2003 (plus a 9th volume in 2006), Ministry of Sound \\"rebooted\\" the Sessions series with a brand new album released in 2005. This was the entirely live recording from Tim Sheridan and Smokin' Jo. This rebooted Sessions lasted for fifteen volumes until 2007. The last five albums of the 15 in this reboot had the issue number as a suffix to the title. 2007 also saw the release of Sessions Summer 2007. Another Summer edition was released in 2009. Various other Sessions were released such as Funky House Sessions.  Spin-offs  The Chillout Sessions series is perhaps the best-known \\"spin-off\\" to the series, beginning in early 2001 when Ministry of Sound started get digital mixers to mix their albums as opposed to big-name DJs like Tall Paul, Pete Tong or Paul Oakenfold. == Series overview == Note: These refer to the albums released in the UK under the Ministry of Sound label, and not any of the alternate releases from other countries or labels (unless it's Defected Records) All releases that are a jointed release between MOS and Defected are mentioned in the notes sections.

The name has been variously spelled Croomb, Croom and Croome. The locality shares its name with the village of Croom in County Limerick, Ireland – derived from the Irish cromadh, meaning bend. The 1,280-acre Croom estate was granted to Isabella Croker in 1839. The following year, Croker sold it to newly arrived settler Ebenezer Russell. Russell cleared the land and established a homestead, stables, dairy and mill that survive to this day. Russell became prominent within the district, and served as a foundation member of Shellharbour Municipal Council. Today, Croom is principally farmland. The north-west corner of the locality is occupied by the City of Shellharbour's Croom Sporting Complex and Shellharbour City Stadium.

It is located just west of Lake Illawarra. At the , it had a population of 1,653. ==History== In the early days Avondale had some fine cedar trees. A creek flowing through the land grant 'Avondale' became known as 'American Creek' after the American cedar cutters who cleared the land along it. In 1857 some traces of kerosene were found in the creek and shale was found on the mountain. In 1863 Edward and William Graham rented part of the Avondale estate and their brother had shale from their farm tested by the Government Analyst. \\"This test proved so satisfactory that he decided to open a shale mine and manufacture kerosene\\". (Cousins 1994, p. 182) See the Mount Kembla page for details on the Kerosene Works at American Creek. ==Alpacas== In 1866 fourteen alpacas were purchased by one of the Osbornes. They travelled from Wingello in the highlands down the Bong Bong Road and seven weeks later were \\"now depasturing at Avondale, and apparently doing very well.\\" (McDonald 1976, p. 41) Gradually the flock depleted due to the need for attention and lack of acclimatization and by 1880 all traces of the imported alpacas had gone. ==Avondale farms== Avondale was part of Henry Osborne's large estate and dairying was its primary industry. See the Yallah history page for more information on early dairying in Avondale and Yallah. In 1893, Henry Hill Osborne's executors put up the 'Avondale' farms for sale and most were sold at a price of 14 pounds per acre. Some of the purchasers included Thomas Armstrong, C. Heininger, George Thomas, James Dawes and E.R. Evans (McDonald 1976). ==Coal mining== In 1911 Avondale mine was opened by the Illawarra Steam and Coal Company Limited. Four and a half miles of railway was to be built to the colliery (Illawarra Mercury, 1911). This colliery mined the Tongarra and Wongawilli coal seams, it closed in 1920 only to be reopened in 1939. It closed again in 1982 due to a loss of contract to supply coal to the Port Kembla Steelworks. Huntley Colliery was a new colliery developed by the Joint Coal Board in 1952. It was purchased in 1951 by the Board and the Federal Government to meet the requirements of the new Tallawarra Power Station under construction (South Coast Times, 1952). Prior to its closure in 1989 about 2,300 tons of coal was mined a day at Huntley which worked the Wongawilli and Tongarra coal seams. ==Population== At the , Avondale had a population of 1,653. 78.8% of people were born in Australia. The most next common country of birth was England at 6.4%. 88.0% of people only spoke English at home.

It is one of six wilderness areas in the Ouachita National Forest and also the easternmost. Outdoor enthusiasts can enjoy the area in a number of ways, including an 8.9-mile hike of the Ouachita National Recreation Trail. ==History== The Flatside Wilderness was designated by passage of \\"The Arkansas Wilderness Act of 1984\\", Public Law 98-508, which was signed by President Ronald Reagan on October 19, 1984. Senator Dale Bumpers (D-AR) sponsored the Act in the U.S. Senate, which was co-sponsored by Senator David Pryor (D-AR) and Senator John Tower (R-TX). An earlier version of the bill called \\"The Arkansas Wilderness Act of 1983\\" had been sponsored in the House of Representatives by Representative Beryl Anthony (D-AR) and Representative Ed Bethune (R-AR). ==Geography== The Flatside Wilderness is located in southern Perry County and northwestern Saline County, though most of it (about 70%) is in Saline County. It is approximately 8 miles north of Hot Springs Village and 21 miles west of Little Rock, and is accessible from Arkansas Highway 7 and Arkansas Highway 9. The Flatside Wilderness is in the eastern terminus of the Ouachita National Forest, which covers approximately 1.8 million acres of western Arkansas and southeastern Oklahoma. It is part of the Ouachita Mountains and features a number of ridges and summits exceeding 1,000 feet in elevation. The highest is White Oak Mountain (1,790 feet), a broad ridge spanning the western edge of the Flatside Wilderness. Others include (in order of descending height) Crystal Mountain, Grindstone Mountain, Flatside Pinnacle, and Forked Mountain. These rise high above the forest and offer spectacular vistas for miles. Mount Magazine, the highest point in Arkansas, can even be seen on clear days. The Flatside Wilderness is home to multiple streams. The two most notable ones are Cedar Creek and Crystal Prong. Cedar Creek is joined by Little Cedar Creek and flows along the eastern edge of Forked Mountain just before its confluence with the South Fourche La Fave River. Crystal Prong flows generally east to west and merges with Cedar Creek near Forked Mountain. The South Fourche La Fave River empties into the Fourche La Fave River east of Nimrod, which empties into the Arkansas River southeast of Bigelow. ==Geology== The surface of the Flatside Wilderness consists of two geologic formations: the Pennsylvanian Jackfork Sandstone and Mississippian Stanley Shale.

He is best known as the founder of Queers for Economic Justice. ==Early life== DeFilippis was born and raised in Queens in New York City, the bi-racial son of two immigrants. He graduated from Vassar College in 1989 and obtained a Masters in Social Work in 1999 from Hunter College School of Social Work. ==Career== DeFilippis is a professor at Seattle University, and the author of numerous scholarly articles and books. From 1999-2003, DeFilippis served as the Director of SAGE/Queens, a non-profit serving gay and lesbian senior citizens. He was the LGBT Liaison for the County of Westchester, where he worked to expand outreach to LGBT people of color and low-income LGBT people. DeFilippis abruptly left the liaison position after a few months. In 2003, DeFilippis founded Queers for Economic Justice, a non-profit organization in New York City that works with low-income lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. DeFilippis was its first executive director from 2003-2009, during which time he built the organization from a volunteer organization into a nationally recognized non-profit organization, with programs working on issues such as homelessness, welfare, immigration and others. Under his leadership, Queers for Economic Justice succeeded in changing various NYC laws and policies impacting homeless transgender people and homeless domestic partners. Other founders or board members of QEJ include seasoned LGBT activists Terry Boggis, Kenyon Farrow, Felix Gardon, Monroe France, Reina Gossett, Amber Hollibaugh, Ignacio Rivera, Jessica Stern, and Jay Toole; anti-poverty activists Ricky Blum, Aine Duggan and Maureen Lane; and noted scholars and authors Ann Cammett, Martin Duberman, Lisa Duggan, Richard Kim and Dean Spade. Queers for Economic Justice was born out of the work of the Queer Economic Justice Network, a coalition of dozens of anti-poverty and gay rights organizations that DeFilippis founded and coordinated from 1999-2003. The Queer Economic Justice Network primarily focused on the impact of the welfare reforms of 1996 on LGBT people, but also addressed other progressive causes. During this same period he also served on the Steering Committee of the Welfare Reform Network, a coalition of welfare rights organizations in New York City. He has taught at Seattle University since 2015 in the Department of Anthropology, Sociology, and Social Work. ==Controversies== During his tenure at Queers for Economic Justice, DeFilippis spearheaded the development and release of a document called Beyond Same-Sex Marriage: A New Strategic Vision For All Our Families and Relationships. The document was organized by QEJ, drafted by DeFilippis and over a dozen leaders in the LGBT community, and signed by hundreds of other activists, including notable gay figures such as Armistead Maupin and Judith Butler, as well as such heterosexual liberal leaders Gloria Steinem, Cornel West, and Barbara Ehrenreich. Beyond Same-Sex Marriage criticized the gay marriage movement as being too narrow and called for a broader definition of family, beyond conjugal relationships, to recognize the numerous configurations of family found in the U.S. It generated a lot of media coverage in both the gay press and mainstream media, including the New York Times and Newsweek. DeFilippis was one of the spokespeople of the document and appeared frequently in the news criticizing the strategies and leaders of the marriage equality movement. Conservative writers who disagreed with the document's goals criticized DeFilippis and Beyond Marriage, as did leaders of the marriage equality movement such as Evan Wolfson. DeFilippis has been involved in other controversies as well. In 2001, mere weeks after the 9/11 attacks, DeFilippis was one of the most vocal anti-war leaders in the LGBT community, putting him at odds with many other LGBT leaders. In 2006, DeFilippis was one of the authors of an Open Letter to the Advocate magazine, where prominent leaders in the LGBT community challenged the pitting of gay rights against immigration rights. Under DeFilippis' leadership, Queers for Economic Justice was also outspoken in criticizing other aspects of the gay rights movement. QEJ and DeFilippis regularly criticized the national gay rights organizations for failing to address poverty in the LGBT community. DeFilippis and QEJ also disagreed with the gay rights movement's emphasis on hate crimes legislation, arguing that the criminal justice system was racist and an inappropriate place to seek solutions to hate crimes. For those reasons, in 2009, while still under DeFilippis' leadership, QEJ was one of five organizations to voice opposition to the New York State Gender Employment Non-Discrimination Act (GENDA). ==Personal life== DeFilippis had a long-term partner, playwright David Koteles. He earned a Ph.D. in Social Work at Portland State University. DeFilippis has taught graduate-level courses in Political Economy, Welfare Policy, Community Organizing, and Social Justice at Hunter College School of Social Work and Fordham University and undergraduate sexuality courses at Portland State University. He is currently a professor at Seattle University. DeFilippis received the Union Square Award in 2004 and the Council on Social Work Education's Minority Fellowship in 2010. ==References * Category:1967 births Category:Anti-poverty advocates Category:Homelessness activists Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Living people Category:Vassar College alumni Category:Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College alumni ","title":"Joseph DeFilippis"},{"id":"35287773","text":"Bathytroctes is a genus of slickheads that occur in the depths of the oceans. ==Species== There are currently 11 recognized species in this genus: * Bathytroctes breviceps Sazonov, 1999 * Bathytroctes elegans Sazonov & Ivanov, 1979 * Bathytroctes inspector Garman, 1899 * Bathytroctes macrognathus Sazonov, 1999 * Bathytroctes macrolepis Günther, 1887 (Koefoed's smooth-head) * Bathytroctes michaelsarsi Koefoed, 1927 (Michael Sars' smooth-head) * Bathytroctes microlepis Günther, 1878 (Smallscale smooth-head) * Bathytroctes oligolepis (G.

Though the satellite was placed in the wrong orbit, there was no damage to the satellite, meaning that it became the subject of numerous reuse proposals. == Reuse proposals == One of the most notable reuse proposals came from a company called Polar Broadband Systems, which was established in December 2011. Its objectives were to submit proposals for the reuse of semi-retired and retired satellites for use with communications over the Antarctic. The company notes that it would not have been feasible to build a dedicated satellite for the region as the population would not justify the expense, however Ekspress AM4 would suffice as it could have been maneuvered into the required orbit. There was enough fuel on board for it to be operational for ten years, with giving the Antarctic region 16 hours of broadband access a day.

He was active in both 17th and 18th centuries. ==Biography== He was born in Correggio. It is not known where he received his first music education. He settled in Rome and studied there with Giovanni Bicilli. His activity has been documented since 1692, when he took part as a violone player in the music for the patronal feast of S. Lorenzo in Damaso sponsored by Cardinal Ottoboni. In the Lent of 1695 he made his debut as a composer with the Latin oratorio Iahelis de Sisara triumphans (libretto by Antonio Checchi), performed in the oratory of the Crocifisso di S. Marcello. In 1696 he was a member of Francesco Maria Ruspoli's household, as we read in the printed libretto of Latin oratorio Moysis nativitas (text by Antonio Checchi). His other oratorios were regularly performed for the same confraternity until 1702. In March 1696 he was appointed coadjutor of Giovanni Bicilli, the chapel master of S. Maria in Vallicella (the so-called Chiesa Nuova).Arnaldo Morelli, Il tempio armonico. Musica nell'oratorio dei Filippini in Roma (1575-1705), Laaber, 1991, p. 191. Some of his oratories were performed at the Vallicella's oratory: La fede trionfante nella caduta di Gerosolima (1702; libretto Pietro T. Vagni); Le glorie della fede promosse da s. Filippo Neri nella compilatione degli Annali Ecclesiastici (1704; libretto Domenico De Martinis); San Lorenzo (1705; libretto Filippo Cristofari). In 1704 his cantata Il genere umano consolato (text Pompeo Figari) was performed in the Apostolic Palace for Christmas Eve. He composed the music of the cantata L'Apollo (text Massimo Scarabelli), commissioned by the Accademia di S. Luca for the annual festival of painting, sculpture and architecture, celebrated in Campidoglio on May 6, 1706. The cantata was performed by the soprano Francesco Besci, nicknamed Paoluccio, accompanied by an orchestra conducted by the violinist Arcangelo Corelli. In 1709, on the occasion of the \\"birthday of Prince Alexander of Poland\\", he composed the cantata with three voices and instruments La gloria innamorata (text Giacomo Buonaccorsi), performed in the palace of Queen Maria Casimira of Poland. According to the contemporary Giuseppe Ottavio Pitoni, Colombani left Rome to accept a position as a chapel master in Ronciglione; he then went to various Italian cities, including Naples, and returned to his homeland where he entered the service of the Marquis d'Este. Later he returned to Rome and resumed also the position of chapel master in Ronciglione. He died in Rome or nearby on 6 January 1711 due to a hunting accident.Giuseppe Ottavio Pitoni, Notitia de' contrapuntisti e compositori di musica, ed. by Cesarino Ruini, Florence, 1988, p. 343 He composed oratorios, cantatas, canons, sacred and instrumental music, including two sonatas for cello and one for oboe. The painter Pier Leone Ghezzi made two ink portraits of Colombani in Filacciano (Rome), fief of the Del Drago family, during the holiday of 1708: in the first the composer is portrayed in hunting clothes; in the second in domestic clothes.Giancarlo Rostirolla, Il \\"Mondo novo\\" musicale di Pier Leone Ghezzi, Milan, 2001, pp. 80, 269-270. ==Bibliography== * Alberto Iesuè, \\"Colombani, Quirino\\", in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, vol. 27, Rome, 1982. * Giancarlo Rostirolla, \\"Un compositore di oratori 'celeberrimo' ma 'vario di cervello': Quirino Colombani da Correggio.

It was co-written by J.R. Orci, David Fury, and Matt Pitts. David Moxness served as director. ==Plot== Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), following both the death of his long-time partner by a shapeshifter, and the recent changes in Olivia Dunham's (Anna Torv) memories that have made her forget her romantic meetings with him, struggles to find his place in the Fringe division. With the main Fringe team preparing to take Gene, Walter Bishop's (John Noble) cow, for \\"grazing day\\", Agent Lee offers to take case dockets through the dimensional bridge to the parallel universe to allow Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) time to spend with her father. Once through, however, Olivia's doppelganger, Fauxlivia (Torv), states that the dockets will have to wait as there is a new Fringe case on their side; Agent Lee offers to help. They arrive at a parking garage, where the night before, a woman had been attacked by a man, but an unknown figure arrived and attacked the man, killing him before disappearing. The deceased man is recognized as a petty criminal, his profile fitting nearly two dozen other criminals that have gone missing in the last month, but this is the first time a body, horribly disfigured, had been left behind. The Fringe team suspects some type of vigilante justice. During the investigation of the scene, Agent Lee meets his doppelganger, Captain Lincoln Lee (Gabel) of Fringe division, finding him to be more outgoing and brash compared to his own mild-mannerisms. Agent Lee also recognizes the close, romantic connection between Fauxlivia and Captain Lee. On further talks with Captain Lee, Agent Lee is surprised to find their backgrounds were exactly the same, deviating only when Captain Lee decided to become more assertive in more recent years. As the investigation continues, Agent Lee learns of how amber was used to quarantine areas of the parallel universe to protect it from singularities, but with the introduction of the bridge through The Machine, these areas are healing themselves, allowing the amber to be removed. In one such region, two workers discover nearly two dozen bodies in various states of decay in a church, and these are quickly identified as the missing criminals. The Fringe division discover telltale signs of shapeshifter extraction marks, though more advanced than the means used by the initial models created by Walternate (Walter's doppelganger). Fringe division hears of another attack on a criminal; Colonel Broyles (Lance Reddick) initially denies Agent Lee's suggestion of a manhunt but eventually relents when both Captain Lee and Fauxlivia agree. The team finds and captures the shapeshifter. They learn he calls himself Canaan, and was the first prototype of the new type of shapeshifter created by David Robert Jones, though ultimately cast aside. Canaan struggles with an identity crisis, feeling alone and rejected, having been promised by Jones to be fixed, but refuses to divulge any information on Jones' location or plans. Unknown to the rest of Fringe, Broyles contacts the Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) of the parallel universe, who arranges for a sniper near the building where Canaan is being held. As the Fringe team prepares to escort Canaan to headquarters, the sniper attempts to kill him. Fauxlivia is able to kill the shooter while keeping Canaan safe, but Captain Lee has taken a bullet and is rushed to a hospital. Once secured, Agent Lee implores Canaan to help Fringe, noting how his life is not safe even from Jones. Canaan agrees, and takes on the appearance of the sniper, allowing him to enter the secured facility that Nina had hidden herself in. Believing that Canaan is the sniper, Nina lets down her guard, allowing Canaan to override the facility's security controls for Fringe to raid the site. Nina and several others are captured, and Agent Lee finds that the equipment in the facility can allow them to track down all the other shapeshifters in the area. As they are clearing out the building, they come to learn that Captain Lee's wound was fatal and he has died, shattering Fauxlivia's emotions. Agent Lee takes Canaan across the bridge back to the prime universe, where Walter and Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) promise to help study and fix him. Lee then returns to help the emotionally distraught Fauxlivia to recover from her loss and to sort through the data collected from Nina's facility. ==Production== Consulting producer J.R. Orci and co-executive producer David Fury co-wrote the episode's teleplay, based on a story by Orci and story editor Matt Pitts. Fringe cinematographer David Moxness directed the installment. ==Cultural references== When Lincoln Lee of the main universe references Batman in the context of the vigilante attacks in the alternate universe, his double and the alternate Olivia are confused. He goes on to explain the concept—a billionaire playboy dressing up in a cape and cowl to fight crime—and the alternate Fringe agents conclude that their equivalent is a character called Mantis. This is in direct conflict with the comic covers seen in \\"Over There part 2\\", one of which depicts Batman himself and another of which depicts the Batman symbol. Differences in comics between universes were also referenced in \\"Subject 13\\", in which young Peter cites that the Red Lantern isn't supposed to be green; this reference is in agreement with the comic covers, one of which depicts Hal Jordan and Oliver Queen using the names Red Lantern and Red Arrow, respectively. ==Reception== Ratings \\"Everything in Its Right Place\\" was first broadcast on April 6, 2012 in the United States on Fox. An estimated 3.01 million viewers watched the episode, marking a slight decrease in viewership from the previous episode. Reviews Cory Barker of TV.com named \\"Everything in Its Right Place\\" the 9th best of the series, saying, \\"this episode was interested in those incremental distinctions in personality—only here, Lincoln was the focus.

It was written by Christine Lavaf, while Jeannot Szwarc served as director. ==Plot== Three people in the prime universe are killed simultaneously when they are thrown into the air and into the ground by a mysterious force. In examining the bodies, the Fringe team discovers marks on the bodies consistent with seat belts. When they consult with the parallel universe's Fringe division, they learn that the doppelgangers of the three victims had died in a plane crash at the same time as the deaths in the prime universe. Walter Bishop (John Noble) suspects that he can learn more about the victims by crossing via the Machine Room bridge to the parallel world, his first trip there (in this timeline) since abducting the young Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) in 1985 and causing the war between the universes. He meets up with Olivia Dunham's (Anna Torv) doppelganger, \\"Fauxlivia\\" (Torv), who is still mourning the death of her partner and friend, Captain Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel). Agent Lincoln Lee (Gabel) of the prime universe has stayed with Fauxlivia to help her cope with her loss as well as to examine intelligence gained when they captured the parallel universe's version of Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), known to be cooperating with David Robert Jones (Jared Harris). Later, Walter speaks to Colonel Broyles (Lance Reddick) of the parallel universe's Fringe division, apologizing for the problems that his crossing caused. When asked by Broyles if he would do it again being aware of what transpired since, Walter admits that he would knowing that it would bring him his son back. As Walter investigates the corpses and one of the hands of the victims in the prime universe, he determines that the two universes normally resonate at different frequencies, but that someone had found a way to synchronize the oscillation of these three people, the effects likely causing the plane to crash. His suspicions are confirmed when a woman in the prime universe, whose parallel universe counterpart drowned when her taxi drove into a river, is thrown across a store, coughs up water, and dies from asphyxiation. On examining the taxi, they find a briefcase containing a device filled with amphilicite, a mineral known to be part of Jones' destructive plans. Walter postulates that Jones is trying to synchronize both universes. Fauxlivia, Lee, and Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) begin to suspect their work is being hampered by a mole within Fringe. Walter stays with Fauxlivia during the evening, the two having happily reconciled their past hatred from before when she had infiltrated the prime universe's Fringe team for nefarious purposes. Walter, in recounting the Sherlock Holmes case of \\"The Adventure of Silver Blaze\\", gives Fauxlivia the idea that Broyles may be their mole because of a conspicuous lack of evidence. She approaches Nina the next day, and tricks her into revealing Broyles' complicity with Jones' plan. Unknown to them, Broyles has been coerced by Jones into sabotaging the efforts of the Fringe division in order to maintain a supply of life-giving medication for his son, Christopher (Curtis Harris). Jones has recently given Broyles another device with orders to plant it within the bridge of the Machine Room connecting both universes. The Fringe team track down Broyles, and are surprised when he readily gives himself up in the bridge room, having previously contacted his prime universe counterpart to arrange his surrender. Walter tells Fauxlivia to go easy on Broyles, as he was doing this to save someone he loved, just as Walter had done before. As Broyles is taken away, Lincoln offers to stay with Fauxlivia to continue to seek out Jones and his agents. Walter returns to the prime universe to study the device, recognizing it as Jones' work, and that if it had been planted, it could have collapsed both universes. ==Production== \\"The Consultant\\" was written by DC Comics' Fringe writer Christine Lavaf, while Smallville veteran, Jeannot Szwarc, directed the episode. ==Reception== Ratings \\"The Consultant\\" first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on April 13, 2012.

It is set in the future, where the Observers have taken control of human society. In 2036, two FBI agents fight to free their world of the Observers by finding the amber-encased bodies of the original Fringe team. The episode's premise is subsequently built upon as the key setting of the show's fifth and final season. The episode was co-written by showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and consulting producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle served as director. While some critics wondered how the episode related to the overall series, actor John Noble has explained that \\"Letters of Transit\\" established the template for the fifth season. It featured guest appearances by actress Georgina Haig and Lost veteran Henry Ian Cusick. The episode first aired on April 20, 2012 in the United States, and was watched by an estimated 3.03 million viewers. Television critics praised the riskiness of the episode premise and the actors' performances while also expressing doubt about its place during the season. The episode was nominated for the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form). ==Plot== The episode begins with on-screen text describing how, in 2015, the Observers, no longer content with observing history, took over human society. They killed many in an event called \\"The Purge\\", and transformed the remaining into a totalitarian culture; though members of the Fringe division attempted to fight the takeover, they were easily defeated, and the remaining Fringe division were allowed to remain to police the human \\"Natives\\". The Observers are aided by the ability to read most human minds, able to sense motives before they can be acted on. In 2036, Fringe Agents Simon Foster (Henry Ian Cusick) and Henrietta 'Etta' Bishop (Georgina Haig) recover the body of Walter Bishop (John Noble), Walter having purposefully encased himself and his team in amber shortly after the Observer takeover. Though they are able to release him from the amber, they find that he has suffered memory damage and lacks the mental capacity to build a strange device of his own design. Simon and Etta talk to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), learning that Walter had William Bell remove a piece of his brain some time in the past, which she postulates could be used to heal Walter's brain now. However, the piece is still in storage in the old Massive Dynamic facility on the main island of New York City, tightly controlled by Observers who can read their thoughts, making its recovery difficult. They are able to make it to the vault in Massive Dynamic, in part due to the inability of the Observers to read Etta's mind, and successfully restore Walter's memories. They are, however, unaware that they have alerted Fringe division—still led by Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick)—and the Observers to their presence; a coordinated team, instructed to shoot on sight, is dispatched. A more coherent Walter explains that, according to the Observer known as September, the Observers made the Earth uninhabitable by 2609, and so traveled back in time to take over the planet themselves. As forces corner the three, Walter sets up an antimatter device to wipe out the Massive Dynamic building and their pursuers. Walter is able to lead Simon and Etta to where Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) and William Bell have been encased in amber. They are able to free Astrid, but as Fringe forces approach they find the equipment to free the others has malfunctioned. Simon sacrifices himself to the amber in order to push Peter free, while Walter severs Bell's hand for an unknown purpose. They escape the area as Broyles and his team arrive, though Broyles finds a piece of licorice, a telltale sign of Walter's presence. As the group travels away from the city, Walter, in an ominous manner, reminds Astrid of what Bell did to Olivia (Anna Torv). Peter then comes to recognize Etta as his daughter, Henrietta, wearing a fired bullet as a necklace. ==Production== \\"Letters of Transit\\" was co-written by consulting producer Akiva Goldsman and executive producers/co-showrunners Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman. Although it was previously reported Goldsman would be directing, executive producer Joe Chappelle ultimately directed the installment. The Observers are prominently featured in the episode, a mythos that has been visible since the pilot. Previously a mysterious background presence, according to Noble, they have now become \\"incredibly centrally important\\" to the series' storyline. \\"Letters of Transit\\" was written and shot before the series' renewal for a fifth season, but it was always envisioned as a genesis of the season. During this time, Wyman confirmed that a majority of the fifth season would be set in 2036, following the events of this episode, a time period depicting the Observers as oppressors rather than as passive witnesses. Leading up to its broadcast, journalists noted that the nineteenth episode of each season of Fringe has generally been its \\"craziest hour\\", and anticipated that \\"Letters of Transit\\" would be similarly strange. The Fox network promoted the episode with a series of four teaser videos, each containing a clue to a fifth video revealing the special opening credits for this episode. The episode contained a new opening credit sequence that helped set the tone, with \\"fringe\\" terms including community, joy, imagination, and free will. Actor Henry Ian Cusick and actress Georgina Haig guest starred in the episode as a pair of Federal agents. Cusick had worked with co-creator J.J. Abrams and executive producer Pinkner on the ABC series Lost. Cusick stated that most of his scenes were filmed with Haig and John Noble (Walter Bishop), and that the story leaves a possibility for the return of their characters in the future. Noble found it unusual to film an episode that did not involve the lead actors. He explained, \\"That was Walter with two really big, important guest stars, Henry Ian Cusick and Georgina Haig. It felt, to me, like it was a really strong episode. The two guest actors did a fantastic job, which is not easy to do, to step into an established company. It is out of the box and is somewhere else completely. I think that the fans will love it. Some fans of this type of material will like it anyway because Henry Ian Cusick was such a big star in Lost, but also, this new girl is just full of wonderful energy, too.\\" According to Noble, \\"Letters of Transit\\" features his ninth version of Walter Bishop at that point in the series. He remarked, \\"It’s a lot of fun as an actor because it keeps me trying to refine and to finish small parts [of Walter].\\" In a June 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Noble called \\"Letters of Transit\\" one of his favorites of the series, explaining that he \\"thought that was really a beautiful looking episode, beautifully told.\\" ==Cultural references== Given guest star Henry Ian Cusick's prominence in Lost, \\"Letters of Transit\\" refers to both \\"The Purge\\" and \\"natives\\", two key elements of that show. The episode also contains references to The Prisoner, where Walter exclaims \\"I am not a number! I am a free man!\\" The episode also references Star Wars when Walter states \\"these are not the droids you’re looking for\\" and \\"Move along\\". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly believed these helped set the tone of the episode: \\"Fringe in 2036 was The Village writ global and under Imperial rule.\\" Matt Roush of TV Guide noted that the episode title, \\"Letters of Transit\\", alludes to a key element of the film Casablanca. The episode opens with scrolling text that has been compared to the start of the film Blade Runner. ==Reception== Ratings \\"Letters of Transit\\" first aired in the United States on April 20, 2012. An estimated 3.03 million viewers watched the episode. It earned a 1.0 ratings share among adults 18–49, a 10 percent increase from the series low of the previous week. Fringe finished third in its timeslot behind NBC's Grimm and ABC's Primetime: What Would You Do?. Reviews IGN's Ramsey Isler gave the episode a mixed review, noting that \\"its concept is intriguing, bold, and extremely risky. I'm just not sure if it works. It's such a drastic change of scenery and tone it's hard to say whether this is genius or madness.\\" Isler observed that he would have \\"absolutely loved\\" the episode if he had been \\"given appropriate context through a suitable setup ... But the approach we got feels an awful lot like a gimmick, and this show does not need to gamble with gimmicks at this point.\\" Isler did find positive elements of the episode however, and rated it 8 out of 10, an indication of a \\"great\\" episode. He praised Walter's return \\"to a much more confident, focused man who's a bit scary in his determination and resolve,\\" as well as the events that followed. Isler concluded that \\"the core ideas are really good, but the way the new concepts were introduced seems haphazard, and a huge gamble that could turn off all but the most hardcore viewers.\\" Like Isler, Entertainment Weekly columnist Ken Tucker enjoyed Walter's transition \\"from happy, babbling, 'I love LSD!' licorice-licking Walter to a Walter who yelled at the others when escaping\\", calling it \\"one of the night's great pleasures.\\" Tucker's Entertainment Weekly colleague Jeff Jensen commented that he was able to \\"roll\\" with some of the less plausible plot details (such as a still existing Massive Dynamic) out of praise for guest stars Cusick and Haig, believing they \\"worked well in this world.\\" Jensen also reserved attention for Noble's scenes, calling them variously \\"frisky and poignant\\", \\"hilarious\\", and \\"touching.\\" Lastly, Jensen was happy to find more details about the Observers, but wondered at the lack of the parallel universe's mention. MTV's Alex Zalben was more critical. He wondered how the episode fit into the rest of the season, and wrote \\"It’s a curious step, and could likely drive even more viewers away from a show that can’t afford to lose them.\\" While disliking the \\"clunky, explainy\\" dialogue, Zalben still commented that, \\"for a die hard FRINGE fan like myself, this episode was crack. Huge emotion, crazy science, and epic set pieces. The end of the episode had me dying to watch the next one, even if it isn’t a direct continuation. That’s good television right there.\\" Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named \\"Letters of Transit\\" the seventeenth best episode of the series, stating \\"What at first seemed to be one of Fringes nutty number 19s turned out to be the episode that helped earn the series a fifth and final year. Of course, some may now question the merits of ringing out the series with a season-long story set entirely in this future dystopia ruled by oppressive Observers. But the single episode that introduced this premise was a cool jolt that opened a new front of Fringe mythology and gave us a character that would have a lasting impact, Etta.\\" The episode has been nominated for the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form). ==Olivia Dunham== Of the 100 episodes in the five seasons, this is the only one where Olivia Dunham does not appear. ==References * \\"Letters of Transit\\" at Fox.com * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Fringe (season 4) episodes Category:Television episodes written by Akiva Goldsman ","title":"Letters of Transit"},{"id":"35287877","text":"\\"Worlds Apart\\" is the twentieth episode of the fourth season of the Fox science-fiction drama television series Fringe, and the series' 85th episode overall. It was co-written by series story editor Matt Pitts and DC Comics' Nicole Phillips based on a story by co-producer Graham Roland. Charles Beeson served as director. The series depicts members of a Federal Bureau of Investigation \\"Fringe Division\\" team based in Boston, Massachusetts as they investigate a series of unexplained, often ghastly occurrences, which are related to mysteries surrounding a parallel universe. In this episode, David Robert Jones (Jared Harris) employs former Cortexiphan subjects to create simultaneous earthquakes across the globe, leading Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) to hypothesize that the end of both the prime and parallel universes is imminent. The two worlds must decide whether to close the bridge that was repairing the parallel universe, or they may all face destruction. \\"Worlds Apart\\" first aired on April 27, 2012 in the United States. The episode featured the return of David Call and Pascale Hutton, two guest actors not seen since the second season finale. It aired in the wake of the official renewal of a fifth season for the series. An estimated 3.1 million viewers watched the episode, a small increase from the previous episode. Critical reception was generally positive, as many highlighted the performances as well as the scene between the two Walters. ==Plot== Several earthquakes strike simultaneously across the globe, at the same time and locations in both the prime and parallel universe. The combined Fringe teams agree that David Robert Jones is behind it, the quakes the result of stresses of bringing the two universes into synchronization so that he can collapse both of them. The teams also conclude that Jones has found a means, through the previous \\"experiment\\" in Westfield, Vermont (\\"Welcome to Westfield\\"), to ride out the destruction of both universes. The idea of shutting down the bridge created by the Machine is brought up, believing that the bridge is enabling Jones' plan. However, this is considered a last resort, as destroying the bridge will affect the healing of the singularities in the parallel universe. When a second simultaneous set of earthquakes occur, the parallel universe's version of Nick Lane (David Call) approaches Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) of the prime universe, believing him to be the parallel universe's version of Lee. Lee feigns familiarity, learning that Nick had visions of being at the epicenter of the quake before it began. When Lee reports this to Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) in the prime universe, she suddenly recalls her Cortexiphan trials including fellow subject Nick Lane, and with the team's help, identifies that other Cortexiphan subjects are the epicenter of these quakes, linking to their parallel universe versions to achieve synchronization. Believing that by taking in one of the Cortexiphan subjects they can stop the effects of another quake, a willing Lane from the parallel universe travels to the prime and is hooked to Walter's (John Noble) equipment. Olivia also hooks herself up, allowing her to communicate what she sees in Lane's mind. When the prime version of Lane attempts to get into the right position, Olivia is able to identify his location, and he is captured in time. However, despite disrupting the process for Lane, earthquakes continue across the world. Walter estimates that the next set of quakes will cause both universes to collapse. The captured Lane expresses his belief that Jones is helping the prime universe to defeat the parallel one. Olivia tries to convince him of Jones' true intentions. Eventually, Lane agrees to show the Fringe team a location where he once met with Jones. The team raids the site but finds nothing; meanwhile, Lane escapes custody using his abilities. With only hours left until the next set of quakes, as projected by a watch that Lane was wearing, plans are made to shut down the bridge before this time runs out. Walter and Walternate (Noble) start the Machine equipment to overload, which will take several minutes, after which they can pull the power and deactivate the Machine. Lee states to Peter (Joshua Jackson) that he will be staying in the parallel universe, where he feels at home, reflecting a previous conversation Peter had with Lee about staying with Olivia in the prime universe. Walter and Walternate have a heartfelt discussion over Peter, and Walter expresses concern that if the bridge disappears, so will Peter. The other Fringe members say their goodbyes to their counterparts. Eventually, the Machine is overloaded and deactivated, and the parallel universe aspects of the room disappear; Walter is pleased to see Peter remains. ==Production== Actress Pascale Hutton reprised her role as Sally Clark from the second season finale \\"Over There\\". Fringe story editor Matt Pitts and DC Comics' Nicole Phillips co-wrote the teleplay, based on a story by co-producer Graham Roland. English director Charles Beeson, known for his work on the science fiction television series Supernatural and Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, directed \\"Worlds Apart\\", his second episode of the season (the other being \\"Making Angels\\"). In an on-set interview with The Huffington Post, actor John Noble explained that the episode's primary storyline concerned the bridge between the two worlds. The third season finale, he explained, ended with the two universes healing themselves with the help of a \\"bridge\\". He remarked, \\"What happens if that bridge now begins to be used as a conduit for evil? That’s the issue we’re facing. What do you do? What do you do with this wonderful discovery? Do you keep it? What do you lose if you lose it? For example, if we didn’t have that [link], we... wouldn’t have all these wonderful characters that we’ve grown to love. What would happen? I think we have to face that issue. We have to face the issue of 'How long can you keep this alive, this link between interlacing the two universes?'\\" Guest stars David Call and Pascale Hutton reprised their characters Nick Lane and Sally Clark, respectively. Both actors had last appeared in the second season finale \\"Over There\\". Lead actress Anna Torv was pleased with their return, explaining, \\"A few faces from the past pop up, which is always fun.\\" The reappearance of Nick Lane and his storyline helped resolve an earlier plot point from \\"Over There,\\" in which he was recognized by Fringe agent Lincoln Lee before dying. Noble noted that \\"Worlds Apart' and the rest of the fourth season brought back a number of characters from the series' \\"rich history\\", including Sally, Nick, and David Robert Jones. \\"This episode,\\" he commented, \\"is bringing those things back together for us as we face the decision of what to do. Do we keep the worlds together? How do we keep them together without creating the monster that is happening? How do we stop this monster from happening? That’s what this is all about.\\" ==Reception== Ratings \\"Worlds Apart\\" was first broadcast on the day following the announcement of the renewal of Fringe for a final shortened fifth season. The episode saw a small increase in viewership from the previous week, with an estimated 3.09 million viewers. In the adult demographic, the episode received a 1.0/3 ratings share, which means that it was seen by 1.0 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds with television sets, and 3 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. Fringe finished in fourth place among both total viewers and adults, behind episodes of CSI: New York, Grimm, and Primetime: What Would You Do?. Reviews \\"Worlds Apart\\" received generally positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen noted that with the closing of the bridge, \\"Fringe effectively pulled the plug on the creative idea that defined the best years of the show. [...] I don't think we can understate the passing of the parallel world premise.\\" While he said he would miss the lost characters, especially Fauxlivia, the series \\"got the emotions [of their departure] just right.\\" He added his hope that the characters would be revisited. In an interview, Pinckner said that they had spoken to Fox executives about closing off the bridge, to which one executive partner reportedly said, \\"I was so sad. I had tears in my eyes when we closed the door\\". The executive added that despite having initially thought the idea of doppelganger characters as a poor one, she admitted that she \\"was so wrong\\". Jensen went on to praise Walter and Walternate's conversation as \\"devastatingly perfect,\\" commenting \\"Just the very action of sitting, of Walternate choosing to literally to meet Walter at his lowest moment, was extraordinarily moving.\\" Dave Bradley of SFX magazine highlighted the episode's acting as one particular positive element, praising Torv and Noble for \\"delivering perfect double performances.\\" Bradley also praised the scenes between the two Walters and two Astrids, writing that the \\"moments of connection make the decision to split the universes apart incredibly poignant.\\" Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Hanson also praised the Walter- Walternate scenes, explaining that after their seated conversation \\"you almost forget the two characters are played by the same actor. If this isn’t the year that John Noble gets recognition for his performances in Fringe, it will be a crime.\\" The A.V. Clubs Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, describing \\"Worlds Apart\\" as an \\"exciting, emotional episode\\" that \\"seems to resolve some of this season’s storylines while setting up the upcoming two-part season finale.\\" His favorite part of the episode was when the two teams worked together; he gave particular attention to the Walter-Walternate talk, remarking, \\"The last scene between the two Walters is something that I’ve been waiting to see for years now, and John Noble nails both sides of the conversation. It’s now one of the whole series’ signature moments: Walter and Walternate, side-by-side.\\" Other critics also lauded the conversation between Walter and Walternate over Peter. In a 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked \\"Worlds Apart\\" as the seventh best episode of the entire series, explaining that it \\"perhaps [is] a little rushed, but overall this is a satisfying conclusion to a number of major plot threads. Airing directly after \\"Letters of Transit\\", the closing off of a number of dangling stories and characters in this episode allowed the remaining two episodes of season four and all of season five to deal with matters closer to home, and tie up the show’s most important remaining mystery, the Observers.\\" ==References * \\"Worlds Apart\\" at Fox.com * * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Fringe (season 4) episodes ","title":"Worlds Apart (Fringe)"},{"id":"35287880","text":"The Armenian Declaration of Independence () is the declaration of independence of the Armenian provinces from the Russian Empire.

Like all other forms of behaviorism it relies heavily on attention to outwardly observable human behaviors. Similarly to other branches of behaviorism, teleological behaviorism takes into account cognitive processes, like emotions and thoughts, but does not view these as empirical causes of behavior. Teleological behaviorism instead looks at these emotions and thoughts as behaviors themselves. Teleological behaviorism differs from other branches of Behaviorism through its focus on human capacity for self-control and also emphasizes the concept of free will. ==Overview== The founder of teleological behaviorism is Howard Rachlin, an Emeritus Research Professor of Psychology at the State University of New York, Stony Brook. Originally focusing his work on operant behavior, he eventually became interested in the concepts of free-will as they applied to Behavioral Economics and turned his interest to the related field of teleological behaviorism from there. A large influence for Rachlin’s work was Aristotle’s early philosophies on the mind, specifically how “Artistotle’s classification of movements in terms of final rather than efficient causes corresponds to B.F. Skinner’s conception of an operant as a class of movements with a common end”. This concept that Rachlin is referring to is Artistotle’s concept of Telos, “the final cause” that drives us all forward towards a common end. Rachlin also found heavy inspiration in the writings and work of Tolman and Bandura after their work in Behaviorism. An example of Artistotle’s concept of Telos could come from the concept of drinking water. While most behaviorists would approach drinking water as a direct reaction to being thirsty, Rachlin would also consider the long-term effects and consider that the person is drinking water so that they do not eventually die of thirst. This far-sighted view offers a different viewpoint into the behaviors of human beings that may not be explained as clearly by operant conditioning, a concept of Behavioral Psychology that mostly focuses upon the short-term reactions that someone has learned. On the subject of self-control, Rachlin states that it is less of a subject of knowing that one should not do something and more a matter of patience. He considers those with strong self-control simply more “long-term behaviorally-oriented” or “far- sighted.” This concept of considering further implications in the future is related to many other fields, particularly Rachlin’s second interest of Behavioral Economics. He likens the ability to weight the options of the future to avoiding making short-term poor investments in exchange for profitable, more beneficial ones at a much later point in time. Many people criticize Rachlin for his perspective, however, as his concepts of simply considering the potential reactions to certain situations over a longer time frame have been hailed as being closer to a self-help practice of making good investments and life choices than it is close to an actual Psychological practice. His main counter to this argument is that through this approach he has managed to help people by preparing them for potential negative outcomes in the future and trained them to recognize their own potential outcomes behind their actions. Rachlin also has a different viewpoint on the subject of Free Will than most other people. He writes, “the meaning of free will lies not in what may or may not be going on in people’s heads or elsewhere in their bodies, but rather in how the term free will is actually used by the community to describe and to guide overt behavior” . In other words, society’s definitions and expectations are what guide us in terms of what they consider right and wrong as any other external factors do. Our definitions of free-will are contingent upon how much we let them affect our actions. == References Sources== * * * Category:Behaviorism Category:Teleology ","title":"Teleological behaviorism"},{"id":"35287919","text":"Shingo Tatsumi (巽 真悟, born January 10, 1987 in Higashimuro District, Wakayama) is a Japanese professional baseball pitcher for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball. ==External links== *NPB stats Category:1987 births Category:Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks players Category:Japanese baseball players Category:Living people Category:Nippon Professional Baseball pitchers Category:Baseball people from Wakayama Prefecture ","title":"Shingo Tatsumi"},{"id":"35287931","text":"Bernardino Lanzani (1460-c. 1530) was an Italian painter of the Renaissance, active mainly in Pavia and Bobbio.

The Royal Navy purchased Supérieure on 15 October, and then commissioned her soon after under Lieutenant Edward Crofton. , , , , and Vanguard all shared in the bounty money for her capture. ==British career== Lieutenant William C. Fromow replaced Crofton almost immediately. Fromow was in command on 6 February 1804 when Superieure captured the French privateer schooner Serpent after a chase of two hours. Serpent, of 60 tons (bm), was armed with one gun, had a crew of 60 men, and was sailing in ballast. Head money for the crew of Serpent was finally paid in September 1827. On 28 February, Superieure recaptured the British sloop Phoenix, sailing from Bermuda. Before 9 March, Superieure also destroyed the barge Mardigras, which was armed with two guns and had a crew of 24 \\"White Men\\", who were sent to Jamaica. Fromow and Superieure captured another French privateer a little over a year later, on 22 October 1804. They encountered a French vessel, which they had to chase for four hours, exchanging fire as they went, before they succeeded in capturing her near Monto Christ. Their quarry was the privateer Chasseur, of five guns and 66 men. She was pilot-boat built and had recently undergone a refit at \\"Jago\\" and was \\"one of the fastest sailing Cruizers out of Guadaloupe\\". During the chase Chasseur fired a 12-pounder gun at her pursuers, causing some damage to the rigging and sails on Superiuere. Return fire wounded five men on Chasseur, of whom one died shortly after her capture. Chasseur had been out only three days and had not captured anything. Head money was paid in December 1828. Superieure and captured the Globe on 18 May 1805. A nine-hour chase on 24 July resulted in Superieure capturing the Spanish privateer felucca Santa Maria Magdalena (alias Son Sorito). She was armed with one gun and small arms, and had a crew of 30 men under the command of Antonio Amet. She had been out twenty days but had only taken a drogger. Still, Admiral James R. Dacres, commander-in-chief of the Jamaica station, described Santa Maria Magdalena as having \\"much annoyed the Trade of the Island of Jamaica.\\" At some point in 1806 Lieutenant John Balderston replaced Fromow, only to be replaced in turn by Lieutenant Edward Rushworth. Between 1 January 1806 and 1 January 1807, Superieure, captured two Spanish gunboats, each armed with one 32-pounder gun, one having a crew of 40 men and the other a crew of 45 men. On 5 July, Hercule, Surveillante, , , and Superieure shared in the capture of the Spanish ship Josepha. Her cargo included 362 \\"cajes\\" of quicksilver. On 25 August Dacres 1806 formed a small squadron under the command of Captain George Le Geyt of the 18-gun Stork. The other three vessels in the squadron were Superieure, the 10 or 12-gun schooner , and the 4-gun schooner . Dacres ordered Le Geyt to bring out or destroy privateers based at Batabano in Cuba. On 30 August the squadron approached the Isle of Pines. There they sighted a Spanish schooner at anchor. Le Geyt reinforced Pike with a lieutenant and eight seamen and sent her to engage the Spanish vessel. After a short chase and two broadsides from Pikes 12-pounder carronades, the Spaniard surrendered. She turned out to be a guarda costa of 10 guns, with a crew of 45 men. Pike took possession of her and took her back to the squadron.James 1837), Vol. 4, 258-60. Le Geyt then discovered that Stork drew too much water to permit her to enter the Gulf of Batabanó. He therefore transferred to the other three vessels his boats and men and sent in the cutting-out expedition under the command of Rushworth of Superieure. The landing party consisted of 63 officers and men. Ten men from Flying Fish remained to guard the party's boats. The party landed on 2 September and crossed some two miles of marshy ground to storm a fort at Batabano. On their way they had to break through an ambush of enemy soldiers and militia. In the process they killed two and wounded one badly. At the fort they captured six 18-pounder long guns, which they spiked. The party then proceeded to take possession of the vessels in the bay. There is some disagreement as to how many vessels they captured and took as prizes, with the total rising as high as 12. According to Rushworth's letter (an after action report), the prizes included a felucca, pierced for 14 guns but only mounting one 18-pounder, a schooner pierced for 12 guns, a French 4-gun privateer, and three Spanish privateers of one gun each. The party also burnt at least six smaller coasting vessels after having removed their cargoes. Total British casualties amounted to one man badly wounded. A later accounting reported that in all cases the crews of the captured vessels escaped. Two days later Superieure captured the Spanish armed schooner San Juan, of three guns and 320 men, after a slight resistance. Superieure then sailed to Britain, where she underwent refitting at Plymouth between 16 March and 2 April 1807. Lieutenant John Buller recommissioned her and on 16 April sailed her for the Leeward Islands. On 17 October 1807 Superieure encountered the French schooner privateer Jopo L'Oeil (or Tap a l'Oeil) about 120 leagues east of Barbados. The sanguinary engagement between the two vessels lasted an hour and a quarter, with Buller being killed instantly by a musket ball to the head while attempting to board the privateer early in the fight. Lieutenant John G. Bird took command and continued the fight until the privateer surrendered. She had a crew of 95 men. She was pierced for 14 guns but carried only six 18-pounders plus another one on a traveling carriage. She was 32 days out of Pointe-à- Pitre Guadeloupe and had made no captures. Bird described Jopo L'Oeil as \\"a remarkable fine Vessel\\". In the fight the British lost four men killed, including Buller, and eight men wounded; the French lost five killed and 19 wounded. The brig was in sight during the engagement but was unable to close until after the fight was over. The British took the privateer into service as . Lieutenant Andrew Hodge replaced Buller in October. At some point (acting) Lieutenant William Robilliard replaced Hodge; Robillard was in command on 22 April 1808.Marshall (1827), Supplement, Part 1, pp.470-472. when Goree, under Commander Joseph Spear, engaged the French brigs Palinure and Pilade in an inconclusive action. Superieur, which had been anchored some miles away, came to Gorees assistance. The French brigs sailed away, with Superieure chasing them; Goree was too damaged in her masts and rigging to continue the engagement. At this point, Goree had lost one man killed and four wounded. Superieure and Pilade maintained a running fight until the French brigs reached the protection of shore batteries at the Saintes. Superieure then gave up the chase having sustained no casualties and little damage. The frigate and the brig-sloop then arrived, but too late to engage. Pilade had lost four men killed and six wounded, and Palinure had lost four men killed and 15 men wounded, among them her captain.James (1837), Vol. 5, pp.41-2. In January 1809 Lieutenant William Ferrie assumed command of Superieure. She then participated in the campaign that resulted in the invasion of Martinique in February. In 1847 the Admiralty issued the NGSM with clasp \\"Martinique\\" to any surviving claimants from the campaign. On 8 February, Superieure and were close to the Virgin Islands when they sighted the French frigate , which had left the Saintes four days earlier. The British set off in pursuit, with Asp falling behind. Superieure, which reportedly had only four 18-pounder carronades mounted, fired some shots, which drew the attention of the British frigate .James (1837), Vol. 5, p. 149-50. The chase continued the next day and into a second night. However, on 10 February, the British frigate , and the brig came on the scene and were able to intercept Junon. Junon was able to drive off Horatio, inflicting damage and casualties on her. Superieure was close by, and her fire caused enough damage to Junon's sails to prevent her escape. Eventually Latona arrived. Surrounded by Horatio, Latona, Driver, and Superieure, Junon surrendered. Although there were seven men killed aboard Horatio, and 32 wounded on Horatio, Latona, and Driver, Superieure sustained no casualties. The French lost 130 men killed and wounded, including the captain of Junon, who died the next day. The British took Junon into service under her existing name. Junon was carrying some sugar and cargo, which resulted in prize money (over and above that for the vessel itself) for all five British captors (i.e., including Asp). In 1847, the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasps \\"Horatio 10 Feby. 1809\\" and \\"Superieure 10 Feby. 1809\\" to 13 surviving claimants from Horatio and one from Superieure. Then, Superieure was present at the capture of the Saintes in April. Lieutenant Humphrey Fleming Senhouse replaced Ferrie. Senhouse received a promotion to Commander on 2 June 1809, and in turn was replaced by Lieutenant Henry Conyngham Coxen (or Coxon).O'Byrne (1849), Vol. 1, p.272. Coxen was promoted to Commander on 10 October 1809, but remained in command of Superieure. Subsequently, Superieure, under Coxen, was also at the Invasion of Guadeloupe in February 1810. In 1847, this campaign earned surviving claimants from her crew the clasp \\"Guadaloupe\\". Between 14 and 17 February, Superieure was at the invasion of Sint Maarten. After the island capitulated Superieure evacuated the inhabitants of the French Quarter. Coxen's replacement was Lieutenant Robert Russel (acting). ==Fate== Superieure arrived at Deptford on 24 August; she then was laid-up in ordinary. The Admiralty put her up for sale on 16 March 1814, and she was sold on that day for £440 to John Small Sedger.Winfield (2008), p.364. ==Notes, citations, and references== Notes Citations References *Footner, Geoffrey M.

It has deciduous leaves and grows to a height of 15 feet (4.5 m). This plant has a high demand for water, and thrives in swamps or wet areas. It requires a mildly acidic soil, with a pH between 6.1 and 6.5. ==Distribution== The species is native to Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. It has spread to other parts of South America and many coastal southern United States as well as to parts of Africa. Due to its high demand for water, this species is often found on marshy shorelines. It also forms dense thickets and thrives in disturbed areas. ==Taxonomy== The genus Sesbania is within the larger family Fabaceae. The Fabaceae are divided into three subfamilies: *Mimosoideae (80 genera and 3,200 species) **Caesalpinioideae (170 genera and 2,000 species) ***Faboideae (470 genera and 14,000 species) The genus Sesbania belongs to the subfamily Faboideae, which has the greatest amount of diversity within the family Fabaceae. The subfamilies Mimosoideae and Faboideae are largely monophyletic, whereas the subfamily Caesalpinioideae is considered paraphyletic.'The Legume Phylogeny Working Group (LPWG).', 2017, A new subfamily classification of the Leguminosae based on a taxonomically comprehensive phylogeny , Taxon , vol. = 66 , number = 1 , pages = 44–77 , http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/iapt/tax/2017/00000066/00000001/art00004 ==Habitat and ecology== S. punicea seed Flowers appear in late spring and persist until the autumn. In the United States, this species blooms between June and September, in South Africa between November and January. When the carpellous structures dry out, the seeds drop close to the base of the plant. The seed coats are impermeable, which means they can be dispersed by water. This impermeability is caused by callose.. Hence, they are often found near rivers and brooks. This species is also commonly found near roadsides, maybe the seeds were imported with the soil used for construction. This species is shade-tolerant. Seedlings can produce flowers and seeds after three month, although flowering most commonly occurs at two years of age. The plant can survive frost, but not for prolonged periods of time . ==Morphology== The deciduous leaves are alternate and compound. Between five and 20 pairs of elliptical leaflets occur on a single stalk. The leaf margins are commonly entire, with little or no serration. Each leaflet is oblong and ends in a pointy tip. The leaves contain stipules that are usually inconspicuous. The flowers and fruits droop at the tips of the stalks. The branches of this shrub are rather thin, and green, but turn a darker red brown when they mature. The bark varies from gray brown to red brown with obvious horizontal lenticels. { Sketch of S. punicea in 1891 Herbaceous habit of S. punicea } ==Flowers and fruit== A flower of Wisteria sinensis, Faboideae: Example of flower structure for the subfamily Faboideae. (Two petals have been removed to show stamens and pistil.) The flowers are shaped like pea flowers, 2–3 cm long, and are commonly red-orange or red-purple. Flowers often form a raceme. Characteristic of the family Fabaceae, this species has five fused sepals and five free petals. The flower always contains ten stamens, sometimes with various combinations of fused filaments. The ovary is superior and the style is often curved. Characteristic of the subfamily Faboideae, these flowers are zygomorphic and have a specialized structure. The upper petal is referred to as the banner, and encapsulates the petals when they are in the bud. The two adjacent flowers, called the wings, overlap the bottom two petals. The bottom petals are often fused at the apex, forming a keel. The flowers appear \\"showy\\" because they are most commonly pollinated by insects, who are attracted by these features. { Sesbania punicea fruit Illustration of placentation of seeds inside the pods of S. punicea } The large pea pods are divided into four compartments and appear as if they have shrunk slightly due to drying These fruits are dehiscent and dry out as they become mature. Each fruit can contain between five and ten seeds, which are dispersed when the pod dries out and opens up. On average, a single plant can produce 100-300 pods. The immature pods are a yellow or green. As the season progresses, they turn a darker green, eventually becoming dark brown. Seedpods often stay on the plant far into the winter, and the seeds rattle when shaken by the wind, giving the plant its common name of “rattlebox”. ==Usage and economic importance== These plants are used as ornamentals due to their graceful shape and beautiful red flowers. It can easily be grown from seeds, which require scarification in order to germinate. The species has been classified as invasive in many of the southern United States such as Virginia, California, Texas, and Florida. This shrub can often form dense thickets. It is replacing native species of plants in riparian areas, taking food resources away from the local wildlife. In addition, this species contributes to riverbank erosion and flooding. It has been declared a noxious weed and/or seed in the United States in the aquatic, terrestrial, and seed forms. This plant has no known economic or medicinal uses. Its close relative S. virgata has been used to control soil erosion, rehabilitate disturbed areas, and revitalize riparian habitats. Juice made from the leaves of this plant reduces the response to painful stimulation and inflammatory edema in mice. ==Toxicity== Sesbania puniceas contains toxic saponic glycosides. The poison can be dangerous to local birds and mammals.. Human who ingests this plant or its seeds can become very sick and may suffer vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory failure, and death. ==Management== The root systems of young S. punicea plants are not very extensive and the soil is loose under waterlogged conditions, so these plants can be removed by hand or simple garden tools. Trees with larger trunks can be cut and treated with glyphosate and/or triclopyr. If they are found in standing water, the stem can be cut to below the water level. Simply flooding the area will not kill them. Biological controls have also been used to prevent this species from spreading. The South American apionid weevil, Trichapion lativentre, was introduced to South Africa in the late 1970s. This weevil has now dispersed over most of the range of S. punicea. The adult weevils feed on the leaves and lay single eggs in premature flower buds. The larvae then feed on the stamens and carpels of the flower and pupate in the hollow husks of the buds. The weevil has prevented the rapid spread of S. punicea in South Africa. ==References== Category:Faboideae ","title":"Sesbania punicea"},{"id":"35288276","text":"Mateo Míguez Adán (born 11 May 1987 in Redondela, Galicia), known simply as Mateo, is a Spanish footballer who plays for Coruxo FC as a forward. ==External links== * *Celta de Vigo biography * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:People from Vigo (comarca) Category:Galician sportspeople Category:Spanish footballers Category:Galician footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Segunda División players Category:Segunda División B players Category:Celta de Vigo B players Category:RC Celta de Vigo players Category:SD Ponferradina players Category:CD Guadalajara (Spain) footballers Category:Coruxo FC players Category:Veikkausliiga players Category:Ykkönen players Category:PK-35 Vantaa players Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Finland Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Finland ","title":"Mateo Míguez Adán"},{"id":"35288282","text":"Sean Sorensen (born 11 December 1955) is a former professional tennis player from Ireland.ITF Pro Circuit Profile ==Career== When Sorensen qualified for the 1977 Wimbledon Championships, he became the first Irishman to appear in the main draw of a Grand Slam in the Open Era.

In many parts of Myanmar, hot air balloons lit with candles, are released to celebrate the full moon day, similar to Yi Peng celebrations in Northern Thailand. The balloons are released as an offering to the Sulamani cetiya in Tavitisma, a heaven in Buddhist cosmology and home of the devas, or as a way to drive away evil spirits. Among Tazaungdaing festivals, Taunggyi's hot-air balloons and firework-launching competition is the most prominent festival. The origin of Taunggyi's hot-air balloons contest dates back to 1894, when the British first held hot air balloon competitions in Taunggyi, soon after the annexation of Upper Burma. Alms-giving and charity, both religious and secular, including satuditha feasts (စတုဒိသာ), are also commonly undertaken during this festival, as a means of merit-making. Others return home to pay homage to elders (gadaw) and visit pagodas. Many concerts and other secular festivities, such as live performances of traditional dramas like the Yama Zatdaw, are also held between Thadingyut (the end of the Buddhist lent) and Tazaungdaing. In pre-colonial times, the Burmese court worshiped 15 Hindu deities on the full moon day. On the eighth waning day of that month, after a procession to the king, 8 pyatthat structures made of bamboo were burned. In Burmese tradition, during the full moon day of Tazaungmon, Burmese families pick Siamese cassia buds and prepare it in a salad called mezali phu thoke (မယ်ဇလီဖူးသုပ်) or in a soup. On this night, young men celebrate a custom called \\"kyimano pwe\\" (ကျီးမနိုးပွဲ, lit. \\"Don't wake the crows up\\"), by practicing mischief on their neighbors, by stealing or playing tricks on them. == Regional traditions == * Residents of Madauk, Nyaunglebin Township and Pathein celebrate with a mi hmyaw pwe (မီးမျှောပွဲ). * Residents of Dawei hold a procession of the 28 Buddhas *Residents of Mawlamyine, Kyaikkhami and other costal towns in Mon State, Lower Myanmar hold a swam oo hmyaw pwe, in which earthenware bowls filled with offertories such as flowers, fruits, vegetarian desserts, candles and joss- sticks are set adrift at sea to the arahat Shin Upagutta at the dawn. ==See also== *List of Buddhist festivals *Diwali ==ReferencesSee also== *Loi Krathong, Thai and Lao equivalent of Tazaungdaing *Bon Om Tuk, Cambodian equivalent of Tazaungdaing *Pavarana Category:Buddhist festivals in Myanmar Category:Buddhist holidays Category:November observances Category:Observances set by the Burmese calendar Category:Autumn events in Myanmar Category:Observances held on the full moon ","title":"Tazaungdaing festival"},{"id":"35288528","text":"Mazajan () is a village in Kukherd Rural District, Kukherd District, Hormozgan Province in the south of Iran.

The initial series was series run in North America in 2011 and ran for seven seasons until the series folded in 2018, where the series was replaced by the Americas Rallycross Championship. In late-2018, Max Pucher revived the brand and set up the series Titans-RX Europe, starting in 2019 and the International Series starting in 2020. The 2020 campaign was cancelled in March. ==History== Ken Block (left) and Brian Deegan participating in a 2015 event at Marine Corps Air Station New River Following Rallycross's inclusion in the 2010 Los Angeles X Games, three demonstration events were held in late 2010 at the New Jersey Motorsports Park, and Global Rallycross Management organized their first championship season of five events in 2011. Tanner Foust won the inaugural championship title in 2011. He retained the title again in 2012. In addition to promoting the series, Global Rallycross Management managed invitations and competition for X Games Rallycross contests. In 2013, the series held races outside the United States for the first time. Later in the season, it introduced the Lites division, a developmental series. Making its debut at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Joni Wiman was the inaugural champion after winning all six races. On October 28, 2016, the series announced the formation of an electric racing division. In 2018 Global Rallycross in its initial form ceased operations, only to be revived later that same year and relocating to Europe, with a plan to reintroduce the championship to North America in 2020. In February 2019, the series renamed itself to Titans-RX, removing \\"Global\\" from its name to avoid conflict with FIA sanctioned competitions. ==Format (pre-2019)== Qualifying Qualifying was conducted over the course of one hour. The field was broken up into small groups that took to the track in 10-minute sessions. Seeding for heat races was determined by a driver's qualifying lap time. Heats A race weekend consisted of one or two rounds of heats that count for championship points, as well as a semifinal. The heats always consisted of three sessions of four or five cars each, while the semifinals consisted of two sessions of six or more cars each. In the case of an event with only one round of heats, such as a doubleheader race, points were awarded in the semifinal, but not otherwise. The top three finishers in the semifinals transferred into the main event, giving their teams time to work on their cars while others continue to compete. All drivers who do not make it into the main event via the semifinals would compete in the last chance qualifier for the final four remaining qualifying spots. Ten cars then compete in the main event. Start Races began with a standing start, where drivers are given 30- and 10-second intervals before the green. During that time they must activate launch systems, including an anti-lag system, before starting the race. The fastest driver in the previous session was given the inside lane to the first corner. Joker lap Each course was equipped with two routes: the main route, and the joker lap route, which each driver must only take once per race. The GRC joker lap route typically shortened the length of the track significantly (while in the FIA World Rallycross Championship the JL detour is longer than the main route, to slow the cars down for a minimum of two seconds), so when a drive takes the joker lap can affect their race strategy. Depending on venue, the joker lap route may have additional obstacles which significantly slow the cars thus making the main route faster. In mid season 2015, GRC made some change to the joker lap, where drivers were not allowed to take the joker lap on the first lap. Penalty box The penalty box was a new addition to series for the 2013 season, and was designed to deal with on-track infractions without having to red flag or restart the race. In event of a jump start or unsportsmanlike driving, the penalised driver would pull into a 50-metre lane off track, where they would be held until a track official releases them. The penalty box was first used at the first event at X Games Brazil, when Nelson Piquet Jr. jump-started at the beginning of Heat 2. Championship points As of 2014, championship points were awarded only to drivers who had committed to running at least half of the season. Under that point system, one-off drivers were skipped over when points were awarded; for example, if the race winner was not eligible to earn points, the event runner-up would earn first place points. Points were awarded at the conclusion of the event to eligible finishers as follows: { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:0 1em 0 0; background:#f9f9f9; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:85%;\\" !f2f3f4\\" Position  ffffbf\\"  1st  dfdfdf\\"  2nd  ffdf9f\\"  3rd  dfffdf\\"  4th  dfffdf\\"  5th  dfffdf\\"  6th  dfffdf\\"  7th  dfffdf\\"  8th  dfffdf\\"  9th  dfffdf\\"  10th  dfffdf\\"  11th and below - !f2f3f4\\" Points  ffffbf\\" align=\\"center\\"  50  dfdfdf\\" align=\\"center\\"  45  ffdf9f\\" align=\\"center\\"  40  dfffdf\\" align=\\"center\\"  35  dfffdf\\" align=\\"center\\"  30  dfffdf\\" align=\\"center\\"  25  dfffdf\\" align=\\"center\\"  20  dfffdf\\" align=\\"center\\"  15  dfffdf\\" align=\\"center\\"  10  dfffdf\\" align=\\"center\\"  5  dfffdf\\" align=\\"center\\"  1 - } In addition, points were awarded in all rounds of heats and semifinals. First place earned five points, second place earned four points, and so on through fifth place and below, which earn one point. Only drivers who were disqualified from a heat or fail to pull to the starting grid did not receive points for their heats. On race weekends with three rounds of heats, the third round solely determined starting spots in the main event and did not award points. At the end of the season, the driver to score the most points was crowned Global Rallycross champion. The top two cars per manufacturer also scored points in the manufacturer's championship. ==Format (2019 onwards)== The new format will first be used in the European championship which will consist of 10 one-day events driven on 5 closed circuits with mixed surface (mostly asphalt and gravel), with an 11th event acting as a series final. Each event consists of: * 3 Qualifying heats. In each of the 3 series there will smaller races containing 3 to 5 cars called groups, and the driver with the fastest overall race time after 5 laps is declared the qualifying winner of Q1, Q2 and/or Q3. Drivers earn 'intermediate points' based on their positions. After the 3 qualifying series, the points are added up and the 12 drivers with the most points in the 'intermediate standings' move into the next round. * 2 Semi-Finals. 6 cars race in each of both semi-finals, which are run over 6 laps. The top 3 drivers in each semi- final move into the final round. * Final. Like the semi-finals, this race is contested by 6 cars but over 7 laps. The winner of the final is deemed to be the event winner and receives 25 championship points Unlike other rallycross championships, Titans-RX has abolished Joker Laps and instead has modified the intermediate point system to encourage overtaking on the main part of the track. Points system Intermediate points are split into two categories, Race Time points (for race time, regardless of group) and Race Position points (for position in each group), which are scored as follows: {  style=\\"font-size:85%; text-align:center\\" - f9f9f9\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Points Scale ! colspan=\\"28\\"  Position - ! 1st ! 2nd ! 3rd ! 4th ! 5th ! 6th ! 7th ! 8th ! 9th ! 10th ! 11th ! 12th ! 13th ! 14th ! 15th ! 16th ! 17th ! 18th ! 19th ! 20th - !

He was also the founder and editor of Nigar, which he turned into one of the most prestigious Urdu literary journals in the Indian subcontinent. In 1962, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the President of India for \\"Literature and Education.\\" ==Early life== Niaz Fatehpuri was born in 1884 at Nayi Ghat, Barabanki district,Mulāhizāt-e-Niāz by Niaz Fatehpuri, pg 9 in what is now Uttar Pradesh during the British Raj. He died in 1966 in Karachi, Pakistan. Niaz Fatehpuri’s real name was Mawlānā Niyaz Muhammad Khan. He was educated at Madrasa Islamia in Fatehpur, Madrasa Alia in Rampur, and Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama in Lucknow. He resigned his post in 1902 as a Police Sub-Inspector after working in this capacity for a couple of years. Thereafter, he worked in different posts until 1921, when he started editing and publishing his famous monthly journal, Nigar, which served as a mirror to the literary scene in Uttar Pradesh till his migration to Pakistan in the early sixties. His fiction consists of seven collections, besides many short stories published in the Nigar. Although at a later stage he wrote a few stories attacking religious hypocrisy and fanaticism and there is evidence to show how his desire grew to reform the society through short stories, his literary romanticism was too frank to permit him to tread the paths of reality freely. His publications include: * Man-o-Yazdan (on religion) * Shahvaniyat (on sociology) * Maktubat (his letters) * Intiqadiyat (criticism) * Jamalistan and Nigaristan (both short-stories) in 1939 * Shaair ka Anjam (\\"Fate of the Poet\\") in 1913 * Jazhabat-e-Bhasha (an appreciation of Hindi poetry), 2nd edn., in 1926 * Gahvara-e-Tamaddun (account of the role of women in the development of culture) in 1932 * Hindi Shaeri (on Hindi poetry) in 1936 * Targhibat-e- Jinsiya Sahvaniyat (on the development of sex knowledge) in 1941 * Husn ki Aiyariyan aur Dusre Afsane (short stories) in 1943 * Jhansi ki Rani in 1946 * Mukhtarat-i-Niyazi in 1947 * Naqab Uth Jane ke Bad in 1942 * Chand ghante hukmae qadim ki ruhon ke sath aur mazamin (three essays) * Muttaleat-e-Niyaz (literary and historical essays) in 1947 * Taammulat-e-Niyaz (collection of articles), edited and published 1951; * 3 volumes of his letters from 1948 to 1951 * Muzakirat-e-Niyaz (some pages of diary) in 1932 * Majmuah Istifsar va Javab (a collection of questions and answers on different topics) in 1938 * Sahabiyat (on some female followers of the Prophet Muhammad) in 1932 Since the publication of his first story, \\"Ek Parsi Dosheeza ko Dekh Kar\\" (\\"Having Seen a Parsi Girl\\") in 1910, most of his stories have revealed an imaginative preoccupation with things unworldly. Such writings can perhaps be regarded more as pieces of poetic prose than short stories which are normally pregnant with happenings. Whenever he chooses to bring in events, as in \\"Cupid aur Psyche\\" (\\"Cupid and Psyche\\"), abstract ideas make their sneaky appearance and overcrowd the events, with the result that they are prevented from proceeding further. By the early forties, Niaz Fatehpuri had already switched over to philosophy and criticism, for the true features of the short story having been identified with those of Premchand by now, he could not but feel the futility of his wanderings in imaginative wilderness. He was the editor of the famous Urdu literary magazine Nigar, some of whose issues are considered permanent additions to the Urdu literature; later, was interested in Islamic history, especially the literary and political aspects of it. He was awarded Padma Bhushan for his services to Urdu in 1962. ==Literary activities== Niaz Fatehpuri was a fiction-writer of repute, whose Urdu short-stories, which are poems in prose, are considered to be on a par with those of Munshi Premchand and find a prominent place in Urdu literature. He was also an Urdu poet and critic, and a polemicist who dared to raise his voice against Fundamentalism. Until he migrated to Pakistan in 1962, he had continued to publish and edit Nigar the Urdu monthly journal, which he had launched in 1921. This was originally published from Agra, then from Bhopal and subsequently from Lucknow. It is still published from Karachi by Farman Fatehpuri. Niaz Fatehpuri wrote on Urdu literature, on religion and on the many evils affecting the social fabric of India in his time. He has more than two dozen major works to his credit. He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1962 for his services to Urdu. He died in Karachi, Pakistan on 24 May 1966.https://openlibrary.org/works/OL363392W/Woh_Surten_Ilahi (Niaz Fatehpuri) ==Analysis== In 1974, Malik Ram included him in his award-winning book of essays Woh Surten Ilahi (The Immortals) on nine unforgettable giants in the Urdu literary world. https://openlibrary.org/works/OL363392W/Woh_Surten_Ilahi (Niaz Fatehpuri pp. 198–235) In 1986, the Urdu Academy in Karachi published the book \\"Niaz Fatehpuri: Shakhsiyat aur Fikr–o–Fan\\" by Farman Fatehpuri on the life and literary works of Niaz Fatehpuri. ==Personal== He is the father of Sarfaraz Niazi, who has translated Ghalib's poetry into English in two books titled Love Sonnets of Ghalib and The Wine of Passion, both published by Ferozsons, Lahore, Pakistan.http://mha.nic.in/sites/upload_files/mha/files/LST-PDAWD-2013.pdf ==References== Category:Pakistani writers Category:Pakistani poets Category:Pakistani scholars Category:Urdu short story writers Category:Recipients of the Padma Bhushan in literature & education Category:1884 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Muhajir people Category:Writers from Karachi Category:Date of birth missing ","title":"Niaz Fatehpuri"},{"id":"35288764","text":"San Miguel High School may refer to either of the following: *San Miguel High School in Tucson, Arizona, United States *San Miguel National High School (formerly San Miguel High School) in San Miguel, Bulacan, Philippines ","title":"San Miguel High School"},{"id":"35288781","text":"Giovanni Colombini (c. 1700–1774) was an Italian painter of the late-Baroque or Rococo period.

According to a letter written in 1997 by the Board of Higher Education, the college was in good standing at the time of closure. It was founded by musician and composer Robert Goldbeck (1839–1908) in 1857 and is claimed to be the first music conservatory in the US.

It is a remake of Kinji Fukasaku's Battles Without Honor and Humanity series from the 1970s, which were adapted from a series of newspaper articles by journalist Kōichi Iiboshi, that were rewrites of a manuscript originally written by real-life yakuza Kōzō Minō while he was in prison. Rock musician Tomoyasu Hotei, who plays Tochino Masatatsu, wrote the soundtrack to the film. Its title piece would be reworked and retitled \\"Battle Without Honor or Humanity\\" and go on to become a hit both in Japan and internationally. The film was followed by New Battles Without Honor and Humanity/Murder, or Another Battle/Conspiracy, directed by Hajime Hashimoto in 2003. ==Synopsis== While the film is a remake of the original Battles Without Honor and Humanity series, it has no direct similarities. Set in Osaka, it focuses on former childhood friends Kadoya Kaneo (Etsushi Toyokawa) and Tochino Masatatsu (Tomoyasu Hotei) as their lives cross paths again. Kaneo is now a yakuza member, while Masatatsu is a nightclub owner with a distaste for crime gangs. When a yakuza boss dies, a struggle for his position takes place between Kaneo's boss Awano (Ittoku Kishibe) and the young Nakahira (Kōichi Satō). Nakahira's men try to extort money from Masatatsu, bringing him in between a yakuza battle. ==Cast== * Etsushi Toyokawa as Kadoya Kaneo * Tomoyasu Hotei as Tochino Masatatsu * Shō Aikawa * Ittoku Kishibe as Awano * Kōichi Satō as Nakahira * Seizō Fukumoto * Shigeki Terao ==Awards== *2000 Nikkan Sports Film Award for Best Director - Junji Sakamoto *2001 Japan Academy Prize for Newcomer of the Year - Tomoyasu Hotei *2001 Yokohama Film Festival Award for Best Supporting Actor - Jun Murakami *2001 Kinema Junpo Award for Best Director - Junji Sakamoto ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack to the film was composed and performed by Tomoyasu Hotei, who plays Tochino Masatatsu, with the London Session Orchestra also performing on several tracks.

O'Meara also translated the Psalms (1856) and the Pentateuch (1861), and Robert McDonald translated the Twelve Minor Prophets (1874). Jim Keesic translated about fifty percent of the old testament, and revised the New Testament. This was published by the Canadian Bible Society in August 2008. Bob Bryce and Henry Hostetler also worked on this project. Jonathan Meeker's translation of Matthew and John in the Ottawa dialect appeared in 1841-44. P.

Dakota/Lakota The Dakota language Bible translation was started with Thomas Williamson and Joseph Renville, a fur trader of French and Dakotan descent. Williamson first modified the Latin alphabet to \\"work\\" for Dakota, he then spent day after day for two or three winters in Renville's warehouse, reading verse by verse from his French Bible. Renville would then give the Dakota, and Williamson would write it down. They finished Mark and John this way. In 1837 Williamson was joined by Stephen Riggs. Both of them learned Dakota, and then compared the tentative translation with the original Greek. In 1843 they offered a corrected version of Luke and John to the American Bible Society to be printed. It took nearly 40 years before the full Bible was translated. Williamson never lived to see it finished, as he died in 1879. Their work was revised by Williamson's son, the Rev. John Williamson.The Centennial History of the American Bible Society By Henry Otis Dwight, pg. 359 Genesis 1842; Luke and John 1843; New Testament 1865; Holy Bible 1879; Eugene Buechel published \\"Wowapi Wakan Wicowoyake Yuptecelapi Kin\\" (The Abridged Bible Stories) in the Lakhota dialect in 1924. It included a selection of texts modeled after the German Biblische Geschichte. Mercy Poorman, Velma Young, and Ed L. Bausell translated Riggs and Williamson's 1887 John from the Dakota dialect into the Lakota dialect. This was published in 1997 by Tiospaye Bible Baptist. The Lakota Bible Translation Project has translated various small booklets with selections from scripture, and in 2006 published Luke's gospel.

The first portion of the Bible in Haida language (Language isolate) of Alaska, 500 copies of Matthew, became available in 1891. It was translated by Charles Harrison (missionary), a Church Missionary Society missionary at Masset. Harrison was sent out in 1882, and returned to England in 1891, being succeeded by the Rev. John Henry Keen. Harrison also published a book entitled \\"Old Testament Stories in the Haida language\\", this was published after he had already returned to England, in 1893. In 1897 Keen's version of the Acts was published: till then Matthew was the only printed book in the language. Keen also prepared Luke, John, 1 Corinthians, Psalms, and parts of Genesis.In Wake of the War Canoe, pg 262, by Collison, William Henry. 1915 (see account of his method of translation, Report of the British and Foreign Bible Society, 1898, p. 317); Luke and John were published in 1899.In Our Tongues, By George Anthony King, British and Foreign Bible Society, pg. 60 It is unclear what happened to Keen's manuscripts for Genesis, Psalms, and 1 Corinthians, as they were never published. {  - ! style=\\"text-align:center; width:25%;\\"Translation !John 3:16 -  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" Keen (BFBS 1899) Shanung-itlagadas hēt-tligai kwoyādagun alth, Gitang swonshuns tla ga il isdagun, la nung yetdasdlu gum il gū-uns gien, il hēnung-a-swonung-ai una. } Keres (language isolate) John Menaul translated Exodus 20 (the ten commandments) and Matthew 5 (The sermon on the mount) into Keres.

Portrayed by Melissa Claire Egan, she was created by former head writer Maria Arena Bell and made her debut during the episode airing on November 11, 2011. Egan was said to be joining the soap opera as a mystery woman involved with Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). Introduced as a con artist and \\"bad girl\\", Chelsea developed into a loving person. She arrived in town revealing that she had become pregnant with Billy's child, later giving up all her parental rights. She then began a romance with Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) which has garnered significant fan attention. Egan's portrayal has garnered a positive response, for which she received Daytime Emmy Award nominations in 2013 and 2014. ==Casting== In October 2011, it was announced that actress Melissa Claire Egan, previously known for her role as Annie Lavery on ABC's All My Children, had been cast in a contract role named Chelsea. Egan's character was to be \\"a mysterious woman named Chelsea who is connected to Billy’s arrest in Myanmar\\". On the topic of Egan working with her former co-star Billy Miller, the actress said: \\"We are buds from way back, of course, from our days on All My Children, and so we have been hanging out even before I came to Y&R.; Now being here with Billy I get to see him double.\\" Egan debuted on November 11, 2011. In January 2018, Daytime Confidential reported that Egan had decided not to renew her deal with the serial and would soon vacate the role. However, the door would be left open for the actress to return. The following day, Egan announced her decision to leave the serial, citing it as a \\"goodbye for now\\" on her social media. In April 2019, Entertainment Weekly announced that Egan would reprise her role as Chelsea; she will begin taping in May. She returned at the conclusion of the June 28, 2019, episode. ==Development== Characterization Chelsea was originally portrayed as a con artist and bad girl. Egan said that she \\"knew some people hate her\\", and she finds Chelsea \\"fun because she's a con artist\\". Catherine Bach was cast in the role of Anita Lawson, Chelsea's mother, to \\"play a vital role in Egan's character storyline\\". Egan said that \\"you see where Chelsea gets it from because her mom is a con artist, but way worse than Chelsea\\", and that \\"Chelsea has more of a conscience than Anita\\". Jeffrey Bardwell (Ted Shackelford) was then revealed as Chelsea's father, after which Egan said \\"it came out of nowhere\\", though \\"it’s great to have so many people to be intertwined with, if you will.\\" On the topic of her character's personality, the actress said: \\"The viewers met Chelsea as a schemester and pregnant with child. She did not have any friends. And now, you will be able to see her personality. We can see her finally in some hot clothes, maybe a skirt, and high heels. She is no longer the beached whale at the bar.\\" In an interview in 2013, Egan stated that she thought Chelsea had \\"certainly evolved a lot\\", saying: \\"Well she’s certainly evolved a lot; I mean she’s done a complete 180 as far as her intentions are. When I started, like you said, she was kind of a con artist, and manipulative, and doing things for money, and you know – completely, kind of not a very good person. But since then, she’s fallen in love, she’s gotten married – she’s gotten divorced! –and experienced life, its highs and lows and ups and downs and learned about family she didn’t know she had. She’s gotten closer to certain members of her family and gained friendships. I don’t think Chelsea was someone who had girlfriends before when she was on the road and cons don’t really have good relationships. So she’s just a better person; a better human being. She’s kind of lived life a little bit and definitely become more of a genuine, well-rounded person.\\" Relationships After giving birth to Billy's baby, Chelsea's next love interest was Adam Newman (Michael Muhney). On the topic of working with Muhney, Egan said: \\"I love working with Michael. I heard about him because my mom had watched Y&R; before I joined. So when I told her my character was going to be mixed-up with Adam, she went, 'Oh! He is so good, but so bad'\\". Egan noted that her mother \\"told me he was a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, it has been so much fun.\\" She said that \\"everyone seems to think we have good on-screen chemistry\\" and that \\"it’s an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the \\"bad guys\\" in town.\\" Egan said that through Chelsea having Billy's baby and giving him up, Adam was her biggest support. The pair eventually married. However, trouble arose following Chelsea's miscarriage of their child and Adam's ex- wife Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) re-entering his life. Muhney was glad that Chelsea had a miscarriage because he did not want to work with young children, saying they have \\"strange hours\\". Adam felt responsible for Sharon being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, because of all of the hurt he caused her in their relationship. He even tried to cover up Sharon burning down Victor Newman's (Eric Braeden) home, working under the law to do so. Chelsea became outraged at him, creating cracks in their marriage; she warned a fragile Sharon to stay away. While telling Chelsea he wasn't attracted to Sharon, Adam later kisses her, which is witnessed by Chelsea. Egan stated it was \\"devastating\\" to Chelsea to realize that Adam was still in love with Sharon. After the couple divorced due to Adam's inability to abandon his corporate life, Egan stated that she was sad to see Chelsea and Adam breaking up, but was excited for the material as an actress. When asked if Chelsea or Sharon was Adam's \\"true love\\", Muhney stated: \\"It’s this back and forth. And if anyone has noticed since I have been on the show, I like to play as much ambiguity in scenes as possible, because then you keep the audience guessing.\\" After Chelsea's separation from Adam, she discovered she was pregnant with his child, but was hesitant to tell him. Of the storyline, Egan said: \\"Chelsea’s just really scared that she’s seen this other side that she’s been hearing so much about – the manipulative, Newman side to Adam, and she’s scared he’ll take the baby.\\" After sharing a one-night stand with Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton), Chelsea decides to pass Adam's child off as Dylan's, and the two are later married. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a \\"ticking time bomb\\". Burton stated that Dylan is \\"not the sharpest tool in the shed\\", as he was believing what Chelsea was telling him. When asked about the child, Burton said: \\"This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s not going to be a good situation for anybody.\\" When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: \\"That’s a tough one. I don’t know what kind of mental state this is going to put Dylan in, to even think about that.\\" Rivalries and friendships Chelsea is known for her rivalry with Sharon Newman, when Sharon began re-entering Adam's life after she had a mental breakdown and burned down the Newman ranch. Adam had an arsonist set fire to another building to avoid Sharon being implicated for the fire at the ranch. The arsonist burned down a restaurant owned by Chelsea's father. Chelsea became insecure and bitter towards Sharon, and was enraged at Adam for breaking the law to save Sharon. Chelsea warned Sharon to stay away from Adam; Sharon told her that Adam would never love Chelsea the way he loves her. Luke Kerr of Zap2It said that Chelsea was \\"out of her league\\" and the storyline was \\"fun\\". ==Storylines== When Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) was in Myanmar and away from his family, he met Chelsea at a beach bar where she was working. After returning home after being arrested there, Billy enlists the help of Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard) to go to Myanmar and find Chelsea to help prove his innocence. Cane talks to a woman at a bar, and unbeknownst to him, the woman was actually Chelsea but she disappears before she can talk to him. Two months later, Chelsea shows up on Billy and his wife Victoria’s (Amelia Heinle) doorstep looking for \\"Liam\\", an alias Billy used. She reveals she is pregnant with his son after he forced himself onto her while intoxicated, and a DNA test proves that Billy is actually the father. Afterward, Billy secretly records Chelsea admitting that their one night stand was consensual and that her rape claim was a con she used against tourists. After Chelsea moves in with Billy and Victoria, Chelsea's mother Anita Lawson (Catherine Bach) arrives in town, creating conflict. Billy and Victoria later learn that Victoria's father, Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) brought both Chelsea and Anita to town to thwart his daughter's marriage. Chelsea later discovers that Jeffrey Bardwell (Ted Shackelford) is her father and confronts him; a paternity test is conducted proving Chelsea's accusations, but Jeffrey attempts to make everyone believe that his deceased twin brother William was her father. Chelsea then befriends Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), and although he tells her he isn’t good enough for her, she persists and they form a friendship, even after Victoria's warnings. After Victoria finds Chelsea having had dinner with Adam, she storms off and falls into a frozen lake; Adam rescues her and ends up delivering her baby. After the birth of Johnny, Chelsea terminates all of her parental rights and allows Billy to raise the child with Victoria. After declining Victor's offer of $10 million to leave town, she moves in with Adam and develops their relationship; he helps study for exams to receive a high school diploma, and while Adam's feelings for her are unmet, he proposes to her in the rain and she accepts. They decide to elope to Adam's childhood home in Kansas (where Sharon unsuccessfully attempts to stop the wedding), and return home to join in a business venture with Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) and Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart), a website called TagNGrab. Chelsea then becomes pregnant and while leaving town on a trip, their car crashes with that of Summer Newman (Hunter King), causing Chelsea to miscarry her son, who she named Riley. Adam then helps nurse his ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), back to health after feeling responsible for her bad mental state. Chelsea suspects that Adam still has feelings for her, and considers leaving him after witnessing them kiss. Adam then promises Chelsea they can move to Paris, but because of his inability to abandon his corporate life at Newman Enterprises, she leaves him and asks for a divorce. After their separation, Chelsea discovers she is pregnant with Adam's child, and while attempting to tell him on several occasions, her new friend Chloe convinces her not to do so. Chelsea and Chloe later start a fashion business, which is picked up by Jabot Cosmetics. After sharing a one-night stand with Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton), Chloe convinces Chelsea to pass the child off as Dylan's, despite Adam's suspicions. After Chelsea moves in with Dylan, he proposes and she accepts, and later has to pay off Jeffrey to keep his mouth shut about the child's true paternity. After their wedding, Chelsea goes into labor and Dylan delivers her child, a son named Connor McAvoy. Soon after Connor's birth the truth about Adam being his father comes out after finding out he'll go blind from eye disease. Adam is furious with her and wanted to sue for full custody, but on the advice of Avery didn't. Adam forced Chelsea and Connor to move in with him, and while there, she gets served with divorce papers by Dylan. She and Adam rekindle their relationship, however they keep running into bad luck. Chelsea eventually leaves town in 2018 with Connor. ==Reception== Egan's portrayal of the role has garnered praise. Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps wrote: \\"With so many stories yet to play out, the Y&R; writers and producers are certainly ready to put it in the more than capable hands of Egan.\\" The character's romance with Adam has received significant fan attention (who refer to them as \\"Chadam\\") as well as a positive response from critics; the website Daytime Confidential placed Adam and Chelsea number three on their \\"Top 10 Soap Opera Couples of 2012\\" list. They wrote: \\"The Young and the Restless made a smart move in pairing sexy grifters Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) and Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan) in 2012.

He nominated for, but was not recruited in, the AFL National Drafts in 2005 and 2006. In 2007, Magner joined the Frankston Football Club in the Victorian Football League, where he played until 2009. At Frankston, he made his name as both a tagger, and a hard in-and-under midfielder. In 2010, Magner moved to the Sandringham Football Club, where he played for two seasons. In 2011, he had a breakthrough year in the VFL, winning the Zebras' best and fairest award, and becoming noted as one of the league's top midfielders. While playing VFL football, Magner made a living as a highway construction worker. He married his wife, Dani, in early 2010. He nominated for the AFL Draft each season throughout his five years in the VFL, but was not recruited. ==Professional career== At age 24, Magner was recruited to the Australian Football League by the Melbourne Football Club as a rookie, using a third round selection in the 2011 AFL Draft (pick No. 42 overall). He was promoted to the senior list as a nominated rookie prior to the start of the season, and made his AFL debut in Round 1, 2012, against the , where he polled two Brownlow votes for his 23 disposals, which featured two goals with his first two kicks. He followed this up with another strong performance against the next week as one of Melbourne's best, with 32 disposals in a 108-point loss. They were to be his two best performances for the season however, as he, like the team, struggled; he played the first fourteen games of the season, but finished with seventeen games for the year. In his second season, Magner played only two senior games for the club, spending most of the season with Melbourne's , the Casey Scorpions, and he was delisted at the end of the season. He later expressed frustration with the way he was treated by the club in his second season; he believed that his VFL form had warranted regular senior selection, but that the club had already decided it would delist him under youth policy, yet the coaches refused to be up-front and honest with him about its intentions, leaving him confused about whether he had any hopes of senior selection. ==Post-AFL career== In 2014, Magner signed with Port Melbourne, his fourth VFL club, where he remained until 2015. In February and March 2015, he played with AFL club Essendon to play in the 2015 NAB Challenge as a top-up player, due to 25 Essendon players withdrawing from the NAB Challenge because of the ongoing Essendon Football Club supplements controversy. ==ReferencesCategory:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Melbourne Football Club players Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Frankston Football Club players Category:Sandringham Football Club players Category:Casey Demons players Category:Port Melbourne Football Club players Category:Dandenong Stingrays players ","title":"James Magner"},{"id":"35288942","text":"Angiolo Maria Colomboni (1608–1672) was an Italian monk, mathematician, and draughtsman, drawing mainly detailed flowers and birds.

Dale played six reserves games and three Ansett Cup games in the seniors but did not play any AFL games for the Swans. While at Sydney he also played for Campbelltown in the Sydney Football League. Dale would return home to Hobart where he led the Southern Football League (Tasmania) goalkicking in 1999. As a child Aaron grew up wanting to be an AFL player like his father. Aaron had explosive speed and however despite his short stature. In grade 10 he was only 157 cm tall and during his 18th year he grew 13 cm in three months resulting in growing pains. Remarkably by the age of 19 Hall would grow to 186 cm, taller than his father Dale who was 183 cm. Originally from the Hobart Football Club in the Tasmanian State League, the same club as his father, Hall did not play underage football for Tasmania like most AFL prospects from the state. He played alongside future AFL player Jeremy Howe in 2010. Hall was recruited to the Gold Coast Suns as a 21 year old in the 2012 Pre-season Draft, with pick number 7. ==AFL career==  2012  Hall made his AFL debut in round 1, in 2012, against he had 17 disposals in a 69 point loss.

Hall's most notable performance was a 5 goal haul vs Hawthorn.  2014  Hall's career stalled in 2014 as he played 16 games with stints in the NEAFL, he kicked 12 goals and averaged 13 disposals a game.  2015  Hall's career would come to the crossroads in 2015 after a groin surgery severely restricted his pre-season and a poor start to the season.http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-09-25/indemand-sun-aaron-hall- inks-new-threeyear-deal He started the season in the NEAFL where he amassed 31 touches and two goals in a defeat.http://www.aflplayerratings.com.au/Ratings/Player/117601/Aaron-HALL This was enough for Hall to come back in the team for Round 3 of the AFL season however Hall would have a minimal impact in round 3 and 4 then would find himself back in the Suns reserves. Once again Hall had 31 disposals in the reserves and found his way back in for round 6. Hall played rounds 4, 5 and 6 but was the sub in round 5 and was subbed out in round 6. Hall didn't even play the next two rounds in the NEAFL, he then played two more NEAFL games before a 29 possession and four goal performance in win would see him return for round 14. Hall was solid for the next 3 games kicking 5 goals but Round 17 would be the turning point in Hall's career In Round 17 Hall moved to the midfield as the Suns star midfielder Gary Ablett was injured in round 16. Hall took his opportunity, refusing to relinquish his position in Gold Coast’s midfield. Across the final seven rounds of the season, Hall equalled or bettered his career-best possession haul on six occasions, averaging 27 possessions, 6 inside 50s and 4 clearances per game during that period.http://www.goldcoastfc.com.au/news/2015-09-25/hall-inks-threeyear-deal Hall's finish to the season saw him poll in six of the last seven games of the year to finish seventh in the Club Champion.

The company's name was changed to Phios Pharmaceuticals in 2018. The company is using its siRNA platform to develop a pipeline of dermatology and ophthalmology therapeutics. The company has developed self-delivering RNAi compounds for the treatment of dermal and retinal scarring and is also working on a proprietary topical formulation of diphenylcyclopropenone for the treatment of warts, alopecia areata and cutaneous metastases of melanoma. == Background == RXi Pharmaceuticals in its first incarnation was founded in late 2006 by the Los Angeles-based drug development company CytRx and four scientific founders including Craig Mello, who had recently received the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his co-discovery of RNAi. The company was taken public in March 2008 when RXi Pharmaceuticals was spun out of CytRx as a separate company. In 2011 RXi Pharmaceuticals acquired Apthera, developer of a peptide vaccine called NeuVax, and changed its name to Galena Biopharma to reflect its change of focus. Galena Biopharma made the decision to spin out the siRNA programs into a separate company, again to be called RXi Pharmaceuticals. This second incarnation of RXi Pharmaceuticals was completed in 2012 when its stock started trading publicly. RXi Pharmaceuticals stock is traded on Nasdaq under the code RXII. The stock initially traded OTC on 10 May 2012 after the spin-out from Galena Biopharma. It upgraded to OTCQX on 19 June 2013 and to Nasdaq on 11 February 2014. The firm is headquartered in Marlborough, Ma. in Middlesex County. The firm's Chairman is Robert Bitterman, previously an executive at Aventis. Its CEO is Dr Geert Cauwenbergh, previously a Johnson & Johnson executive who was named CEO in May 2012. Craig Mello remains involved with RXi as Chairman of its Scientific Advisory Board. == Products == RXi's technology platform allows the development of 'self- delivering’ RNAi compounds, or 'sd-rxRNA' for short, in which drug-like properties were built into the RNAi compound itself, rather than relying on liposomal delivery to improve circulation time and cellular uptake. This platform was developed through systematic medicinal chemistry screening. RXi scientists have shown the utility of their platform in three papers: RXi's SD- rxRNA compounds are constructed using a single-stranded phosphorothioate region, a short duplex region, and a variety of nuclease-stabilizing and lipophilic chemical modifications. The result is spontaneous uptake in multiple cell types in vitro and in vivo. Samcyprone is RXi's proprietary topical formulation of diphenylcyclopropenone. The product, an immunomodulator that works by initiating a T-cell response, entered Phase II for the treatment of cutaneous warts in December 2015. In March 2015 it was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of malignant melanoma stage IIb to IV. RXi's first sd-rxRNA candidate, RXI‑109, is designed to reduce the expression of connective tissue growth factor, a critical regulator of biological pathways involved in fibrosis, including scar formation in the skin. The product has been in several clinical studies, including: Abdominoplasty Phase I study, ., initiated in June 2012, looked at the ability of RXI 109 to reduce scarring in women undergoing elective abdominoplasty; and Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration Phase 1/2 study. initiated in November 2015. == References == Category:Biotechnology companies of the United States ","title":"Phio Pharmaceuticals"},{"id":"35289163","text":"The 660 & 760 Class railcars are a Diesel Multiple Unit train built by the New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR) and used in the latter stages of their life by CityRail, primarily on its Hunter Valley line. The trains have since been phased out in favour of the newer Endeavour railcar model. The 660/760 railcars were converted by NSWGR from earlier 600/700 Class vehicles between 1973 and 1975. The 600 Class railcars, built in 1949–1950, were not compatible electrically with the later 900/950 and 620 Class diesel trains. In 1972, NSWGR purchased 22 Cummins 14-litre diesel engines and Twin Disc hydraulic transmissions with the intention of re-engining the entire ten units of the class and making them compatible with their later sisters. As a result of continued mechanical failures of some of the 620 Class units, a number of these engines and transmissions were diverted to upgrade the 620 Class, and in the end only five of the ten 600 Class sets were converted. The converted units were fitted with two 300 hp Cummins NT-855-R2 in-line six cylinder, four stroke diesel engines coupled to Twin Disc DFFR 10034 automatic lock-up torque converter transmissions. They were also fitted with 620 Class control systems and were then able to work in multiple with the 900/950 and 620 Class units. During the reconstruction, side-mounted radiators were fitted in the centre of the power car. The original window arrangement of the luggage compartment was not changed, retaining the three original windows. However, one window was removed from the No.2 End passenger compartment to accommodate the larger radiators. The louvred side radiator vents are an aid to distinguish them from their earlier 600 Class sisters. Apart from control system and driver's cab changes, the layout of the trailer cars was unaltered. The units were renumbered as the 660/760 Class by the simple expedient of adding 60 to their original numbers. The units converted were 601/701, 605/705, 608/708, 609/709 and 610/710. 601 becoming 661, 701 becoming 761, 605 becoming 665, etc. Once converted, the 660/760's worked interchangeably with the 620 Class on Newcastle, Wollongong and outer Sydney suburban services. Like the 620 Class, the 660's were re-engined with more powerful 335 hp Cummins NTA-855-R4 diesel engines coupled to Voith T211r automatic lock-up torque converters in the 1980s. All sets were withdrawn by 1994 and some have been preserved in heritage rolling stock collections. Carriage 661 (paired with carriage 726) was leased from the Lithgow State Mine Railway by the Byron Bay Railroad Company which financially contributed to the heritage restoration of the railcar set. Volunteers at the Lithgow Railway Workshop spent thousands of voluntary hours to restore the carriages. The railcar set 661/726 returned to service with the Byron Bay Railroad Company on 16 December 2017 and currently runs along 3 km of track which is part of the 132 km Casino to Murwillumbah line. == See also == * Byron Bay Train * Rail rollingstock in New South Wales ==References Further reading  External links == * Byron Bay Train - http://byronbaytrain.com.au/ Category:Diesel multiple units of New South Wales ","title":"New South Wales 660/760 class railcar"},{"id":"35289178","text":"Alokeranjan Dasgupta (born 6 October 1933 in Calcutta) is a Bengali poet who is the author of over 20 books of poetry.

It is also known as Mahasui or Mahasuvi. The speaking population is about 1,000,000 (2001). It is more commonly spoken in the Himachal Pradesh, Shimla (Simla) and Solan districts. It is to be known that Shimla and Solan were parts of the old Mahasu district. Himachal Pradesh State on 1 September, 1972 reorganised the districts dissolving Mahasu district. The Solan district was carved out of Solan and Arki tehsils of the then Mahasu district and tehsils of Kandaghat and Nalagarh of the then Shimla District of Punjab. == Area == According to different locations, the language has developed several dialects. Lower Mahasu Pahari (Baghati, Baghliani, Kiunthali), Upper Mahasu Pahari (Rampuri, Rohruri, Naweri, Jubbali, Shimla Siraji, Sodochi). The Kiunthali variety appears to be understood by others, and their attitude toward it is favorable. Rampuri is also called Kochi; Rohruri is also called Soracholi and Sodochi spoken in Kotgarh. Intelligibility among dialects is above 85%. Lexical similarity is 74%–82% with upper dialects, and 74%–95% with lower dialects. The language is used in home and for religious purposes.

The language has no official status and is recorded as dialect of Hindi. According to the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the language is of definitely endangered category, i.e. many Mahasui children are not learning Mahasui as their mother tongue any longer. Earlier the language state patronage. Everything changed since independence, due to favoritism towards Hindi by the Indian Government. The demand for the inclusion of 'Pahari (Himachali)' under the Eight Schedule of the Constitution, which is supposed to represent multiple Pahari languages of Himachal Pradesh, had been made in the year 2010 by the state's Vidhan Sabha. There has been no positive progress on this matter since then even when small organisations are taking upto themselves to save the language and demanding it.

It is not a projective configuration, however, because its points and lines do not all have the same number of incidences as each other. It was introduced by Micha Perles in the 1960s. ==Construction from a regular pentagon== One way of constructing the Perles configuration is to start with a regular pentagon and its five diagonals, which form the sides of a smaller regular pentagon within the initial one. The nine points of the configuration consist of four out of the five vertices of each pentagon and the shared center of the two pentagons; the two missing pentagon vertices are chosen to be collinear with the center. The nine lines of the configuration consist of the five lines that are diagonals of the outer pentagon and sides of the inner pentagon, and the four lines that pass through the center and through corresponding pairs of vertices from the two pentagons. ==Projective invariance== Every realization of this configuration in the real projective plane is equivalent, under a projective transformation, to a realization constructed in this way from a regular pentagon. Therefore, in every realization, there are four points having the same cross-ratio as the cross- ratio of the four collinear points in the realization derived from the regular pentagon. But, these four points have 1+\\\\varphi as their cross-ratio, where \\\\varphi is the golden ratio, an irrational number. Every four collinear points with rational coordinates have a rational cross ratio, so the Perles configuration cannot be realized by rational points. Branko Grünbaum has conjectured that every configuration that can be realized by irrational but not rational numbers has at least nine points; if so, the Perles configuration would be the smallest possible irrational configuration of points and lines.. ==Application in polyhedral combinatorics== Perles used his configuration to construct an eight-dimensional convex polytope with twelve vertices that can similarly be realized with real coordinates but not with rational coordinates. The points of the configuration, three of them doubled and with signs associated with each point, form the Gale diagram of the Perles polytope. Ernst Steinitz's proof of Steinitz's theorem can be used to show that every three-dimensional polytope can be realized with rational coordinates, but it is now known that there exist irrational polytopes in four dimensions. However, the Perles polytope has the fewest vertices of any known irrational polytope., p. 96a. ==NotesReferences== *. *. * Category:Configurations (geometry) Category:Polyhedral combinatorics ","title":"Perles configuration"},{"id":"35289241","text":"Chatterbox (addressed in the opening credits as Chatterbox!; also known as Virginia the Talking Vagina) is a 1977 American comedy film about a woman with a talking vagina.

With > her self-confidence restored, she makes several hit appearances on TV > talkshows; the theory, apparently, is that Virginia makes an even more > interesting late-night guest than Truman Capote. ==Plot== Penelope, a young hairdresser, discovers her vagina can talk when it criticizes a lover's performance, who leaves in a huff. At the salon where she works, her talking vagina insults a lesbian client, which leads to her being fired. Penelope goes to a psychiatrist, Dr. Pearl, where she reveals her \\"problem\\". In the psychiatrist's office, her vagina reveals a new talent, singing. It has a propensity for singing show tunes. Dr. Pearl reveals her secret to friends of his in show business. At a meeting of the American Medical Association, Penelope and her talking vagina, now called \\"Virginia\\", are revealed to the public for the first time. Virginia regales the assembled physician with show tunes. Dr. Pearl becomes her agent, and over Penelope's objections, launches Penelope and Virginia on an entertainment career. At a show hosted by Professor Irwin Corey, Virginia sings in public for the first time, becoming a star after crooning a disco tune. Virginia increasingly becomes the tail that wags the dog, with Penelope becoming increasingly unhappy as \\"they\\" become a successful act on a cross-country tour. Despite her new success, Penelope decides to kill herself until she sees the lover from the start of the movie and discovers that he has a talking penis. ==Cast== *Candice Rialson as Penelope Pittman *Larry Gelman as Dr. Werner Pearl *Jane Kean as Eleanor Pittman *Arlene Martel as Marlene *Rip Taylor as Mr. Jo *Professor Irwin Corey as Himself *Sandra Gould as Mrs. Bugatowski ==Critical reception== Chatterbox was poorly received by audiences.

Los Angeles Times 21 Nov 1977: g12.

The book was published in January 2012 by Tor Teen and is the first installment in a trilogy. The novel tells the story of Ember Miller and Chase Jennings, two teenagers who are on the run from the government in a post-War dystopian America. It was followed by two sequels titled Breaking Point and Three. ==Plot summary== A war has torn through the United States, leading to the establishment of the Federal Bureau of Reformation (FBR) and a re-writing of the Bill of Rights, leaving the Moral Statues. The FBR have started a new war, and that's a war on sex. Women that break Article 5 and have children out of wedlock are taken away and imprisoned, as is the case with Ember Miller's mother. The FBR have captured the two of them and have sent Ember to the Girls Reformatory and Rehabilitation Center of West Virginia. There Ember attempts and fails to escape, only succeeding when her old love interest Chase intervenes and runs away with her to Virginia. There they have plans to go to a safehouse where Ember's mom is supposedly located, only to find the man who was supposed to transport them has been shot by the FBR. Before he dies, he tells the two teens of a carrier in West Virginia that could help them. The two later learn of a carrier and underground system in their former hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee, which prompts them to return in the hopes of finding escape. As they grow closer to the town, they learn that the town is in the process of being closed off to create a base for the FBR and that the streets are full of people that are either homeless or working for the FBR. Chase and Ember are separated when a scuffle for food turns into a riot and Ember is grabbed by Sean Banks, a member of the local resistance. Ember informs Sean of her time at the reformatory and of his girlfriend Rebecca that was placed there with her. Ember then learns that the ones who break Article 5 are killed and that Chase had been forced to kill her mother. She later leaves the Resistance hideout and is captured and taken to the Knoxville Detention Center. A member of the center, Tucker Morris, attempts to bribe Ember into revealing Chase's location, to which she refuses. As punishment Ember is placed on cleaning duty and tolerates Tucker's molestation of her in order to learn news of her friend Rebecca, who has been placed in a Chicago reformatory. Ember begins to make plans to escape, which are interrupted due to Chase being captured and brought to the detention center. She must then find a way to save them both. The two manage to escape and the book ends with Ember and Chase lying together on the roof of the Resistance's headquarters. ==Inspirations== The inspiration for Article 5 came to Kristen Simmons after she saw people protesting against the release of a children's book. She asked herself what else could be banned. She had the idea of the story, wrote it from start to finish, and took about a year to revise it. ==Characters== *Ember Miller: A seventeen-year-old girl and the main character of the story that sets out to save her mother from the FBR. It is mentioned that she and Chase have had a romantic relationship when they were younger. *Chase Jennings: An old neighbor and former romantic interest of Ember’s, Chase is now a FBR soldier that goes AWOL to assist Ember and get her to a safehouse. *Sean Banks: A member of the Knoxville Resistance, Sean assists Ember in her attempt to jump over the reformatory wall. *Beth: One of Ember's friends from childhood. *Tucker Morris: An evil man who grew up loving the MM, and wanted to be an soldier, and he was finally able to fulfill that, but it changed him into an evil person. *Rebecca Lansing: Ember's roommate at the reformatory. She is perceived to be a perfect rule follower, but is actually dating Sean Banks, a guard. She is arrested when Ember attempts to blackmail Sean into helping her escape. == Reception == Article 5 received mixed reviews when it came to the plot and the characters, with a reviewer for Tor.com calling it a “provocative, terrifying, frustrating” book, as described by Michael Jones. Wired stated that the book was a fun read but that the enjoyment would depend \\"on your taste in books and politics\\". ==References External links == * Official Website Category:2012 science fiction novels Category:Dystopian novels Category:Novels set in West Virginia Category:Tor Books books ","title":"Article 5 (novel)"},{"id":"35289311","text":"David Buchanan may refer to: * David Buchanan (baseball) (born 1989), American professional baseball pitcher * David Buchanan (cricketer) (1830–1900), spin bowler for pre-first-class Warwickshire and the Gentlemen * David Buchanan (footballer, born 1962), English professional footballer * David Buchanan (footballer, born 1986), professional footballer * David Buchanan (musician), American bass guitarist with Yankee Grey * David Buchanan (One Life to Live), a fictional character from the soap opera One Life to Live * David Buchanan (politician) (1823–1890), member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and later the Council * David Buchanan (writer) (1595?–1652?), Scottish writer, author of De Scriptoribus Scotis and relative of historian George Buchanan * David M.

It was the first shortwave radio station in Europe, and the first dedicated shortwave radio station in the world - previous stations had simulcast AM/medium wave broadcasts. The station officially went on the air on 11 March 1927 broadcasting on 9930 kHz in a transmission to the Dutch East Indies with the words \\"Hello Dutch East Indies, this is PCJJ, the shortwave transmitter of Philips Laboratories in Eindhoven.\\"Broadcasting in the Malay world: radio, television, and video in Brunei By Drew O. McDaniel PCJJ was soon broadcasting in English, Spanish, German and Dutch to a worldwide audience. On 30 May and 1 June 1927, Queen Wilhelmina and crown princess Juliana spoke over PCJJ to the colonial subjects in the Dutch East and West Indies.Philips Museum PCJJ was likely the first shortwave radio station in the world to provide distinct programming rather than a simulcast of domestic stations. The multilingual Edward Startz joined PCJJ in 1928 and became its best known announcer. He created the light entertainment Happy Station show which became the world's longest running shortwave program and informally rechristened the station PCJ for Peace, Cheer and Joy. In July 1927, Philips established PHOHI (Philips Omroep Holland-Indië or Philips Holland-India Broadcasting Station). The new venture originally shared PCJJ's transmitter until December 1928 when PCJJ's sister transmitter PHI was completed for PHOHI programming. PHI broadcast in Dutch to the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and the Dutch West Indies (now the Netherlands Antilles) while PCJJ now broadcast in English, Spanish and German to Europe and the rest of the world.Radio Netherlands: ‘Happy Station’ history transcript\\"50 Years Shortwave In Holland : klankbeeld 1977-04-15 / 1977-03-30\\" , RNW In 1929, PCJJ was renamed PCJ. Beginning in February 1929, PCJ broadcast experimental radio programmes on behalf of the League of Nations using the call letters PCLL. The shows were produce in Geneva and sent to PCJ by landline. The service was known as \\"Radio Nations\\" and its broadcasts via PCJ continued until the League of Nations' own transmitters, HBL and HBP were inaugurated in 1932.http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/Wavescan/wavescan455.html PHI ceased broadcasting in 1930 due to the government's new regulations regarding Dutch language broadcasting but PCJ continued. PHI was able to resume broadcasting in 1934 and would broadcast Dutch as well as English programming to the eastern hemisphere which PCJ broadcast to the western hemisphere. In 1937, the transmitters were relocated to Huizen with studios in nearby Hilversum. The transmitter complex comprised 24 antennas on wooden antenna towers weighing 18 tons each, which were built on concentric rails to allow them to be rotated so that they could be aimed in any direction. Reception would equal that of a 2000 kilowatt station. Broadcasts from the Netherlands were interrupted by the German invasion in May 1940. PCJ broadcast the events of the invasion for four days until Eddy Startz was arrested. The staff of PCJ tried to destroy the Huizen transmitters, but they were repaired by the Germans used for black propaganda to India under the name ”The Voice of Free India”. Transmissions from the occupied facility were also heard as far away as Australia using the call sign DXL15.http://www.ontheshortwaves.com/Wavescan/wavescan352.html PCJ resumed broadcasting in October 1945, as a result of the liberation of the Netherlands. The two shortwave stations were nationalised and became Radio Netherlands Worldwide, the Dutch International Service on 15 April 1947 though PCJ programs such as Happy Station continued on the new station and the PCJ call letters were kept by Radio Netherlands for several years.Radio Nederland Wereldomroep International Program Service Summer Schedule, 1948 The Taiwan- based PCJ Radio, which produces the revived Happy Station show, takes its name from the original PCJ. ==References== *Broadcasting on the short waves, 1945 to today By Jerome S.

It mainly functioned as an alternate route for US-89, US-91, and I-15 traffic that provided access to industrial areas of the two cities and avoided urban cross-traffic in Downtown Salt Lake City. The original route followed 900 South west from State Street (Salt Lake County) (concurrent US-89 and US-91) to 300 West and then traveled north on 300 West to meet US-89 and US-91 again at South Temple (or, later, at North Temple). The route was subsequently changed to follow 300 West only: it followed 300 West all the way from 3300 South (SR-171) to North Temple (traffic from either I-15 or State Street could reach the southern end along short stretches of SR-171). Before the mid-20th century, 300 West was confusingly known as Second West, based on the idea of numbering streets from the nearest corner of Temple Square rather than just from the southeast corner (which is the only origin recognized by the modern Salt Lake County addressing system). ==Route description== 300 West From 1967 to 1969, SR-176 started at an intersection with SR-171 in South Salt Lake only about a block east of I-15 and proceeded straight north as a four-lane (plus, as of 2012, a center turn lane) road without continuous sidewalks (300 West continues south of this point before swerving east to avoid crossing the FrontRunner and Union Pacific railroad corridor (Rio Grande's Utah Division during the 1960s) at an acute angle and connects to a short frontage road of 3900 South, but was never a state highway). The road runs down the middle of an isolated strip of land cut off from its surroundings by I-15 on the west and the TRAX light rail line (previously Union Pacific's mainline to Provo) on the east; the freeway is always between a block and two blocks to the west and the rail line is exactly a block to the east. The area is occupied almost totally by industrial and specialized wholesale businesses that benefit from relatively easy access to the freeway (and, in some cases, the railroad's freight service) without suffering from the difficulty in access from surrounding neighborhoods. 300 West passes under I-80 about a mile north of SR-171, and then crosses the TRAX Green Line (originally Rio Grande's line to Park City) before intersecting SR-201 (2100 South), the first major east-west street north of 3300 South, and enters Salt Lake City. Due to the east-west traffic and the easy access from the major freeway crossing just to the west, this area has many big box stores (as of 2012). Further north, the surroundings revert to mainly industrial and wholesale uses. North of 1700 South, the route crosses the former Salt Lake and Utah Railroad right-of-way. Near 1300 South (the next street north of 2100 South to provide freeway access), there are (as of 2012) several more big box stores, and, where not taken up by the big box stores, the surroundings begin to have a more varied mix of uses, including local retail. , the road gains continuous sidewalks in this area. Though the TRAX line remains exactly a block to the east until 700 South, the former Union Pacific mainline that it uses south of 1300 South curves west and crosses 300 West at Brooklyn Avenue; since this mainline lost its connection to the north in about 2000, it is now only a minor freight spur. Just a few yards (meters) north of the rail crossing, the street passes under the long elevated ramps connecting the concurrent interstates 15 and 80 to West Temple, SR-270. About a block further north, in the Granary District neighborhood, 1967-1969 SR-176 joins its 1935-1967 route, which came from the east on 900 South. SR-176 continued north on 300 West from this intersection throughout its history. The route passes the historic Fifth Ward Meetinghouse, then intersects eastbound SR-269 at 600 South. From approximately 1963 to 2000, this intersection was grade separated, but it is now an ordinary signalized intersection (though unusual for Salt Lake City since 600 South is one-way). One block further north, 300 West intersects westbound SR-269; unlike at 600 South, this intersection was never grade separated. North of the intersection with 400 South next to Pioneer Park, 300 West now carries US-89; for the description of the last four- or five-block stretch of former SR-176, see US-89 (UT). 900 South SR-176 extended for four blocks (0.5 mile or 800 meters) along 900 South from 1935 to 1967. From 300 West, the modern street proceeds east with four lanes, sidewalks and a center turn lane. At 200 West (once known as First West), it crosses tracks (in 200 West's median) used by all three of the Utah Transit Authority's light rail lines, directly south of the 900 South station. This line was originally the Salt Lake and Utah interurban line, and continued to be used for local freight after most of the route to Utah County was abandoned. At West Temple (100 West), 900 South intersects SR-270 right as the bridges connecting that route to interstates 15 and 80 end. Former SR-176 then crosses Main Street before the state highway designation ended at modern US-89 (State Street). The state highway included only a short segment of 900 South, which extends as a continuous city street (entirely in Salt Lake City) from the Jordan River to near SR-186 at the mouth of Emigration Canyon. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * List of state highways in Utah * List of highways numbered 176 ==References * Utah Department of Transportation Highway Resolutions: Route 176 (PDF) 176 176 Category:South Salt Lake, Utah ","title":"Utah State Route 176 (1933–1969)"},{"id":"35289412","text":"Paeonol is a phenolic compound found in peoniesZhang, L., Li, D.

More accurately, it is in the Beroun District above the village of Točník. It was built during the reign of Wenceslaus IV at the end of the 14th century above the already existing castle Žebrák as his private residence. The two castles, Točník and Žebrák, make up a picturesque \\"couple,\\" standing almost right next to each other. ==History== The area where the castle stands was inhabited by people two thousand years ago, but it was not until the 14th century when the Bohemian and German king Wenceslaus IV decided to build his residence there. The castle Točník was built after the large fire in the castle Žebrák, which showed how unsafe it was for the king and how its position was not strategic. The castle was built on a three-part ground plan. Behind the defensive wall is a massive moat with a bridge, which was originally protected by a gate tower. The most important building, situated in the residential section on the L-shaped ground plan, is the Royal Palace with its side wing. The second floor of the palace was taken up with a ceremonial hall, while other floors were residential. During the Hussite wars, when Václav's brother Sigismund was in power, the castle was besieged by the Hussite army for three days, until it gave up and burnt down the towns Točník and Hořovice instead. The castle was then mortgaged and handed over from one person to another, but it never found an owner that would keep it for a longer time and so it was gradually reduced to ruins. Jan of Watemberg initiated the first stage of the Renaissance alterations, which were continued by the Lobkowicz family. In 1594, the castle came once again to the royal property and was administrated by the Bohemian (Czech) Royal Chamber. The Thirty Years' War contributed greatly to the castle's deterioration. In the year 1923, the castle was sold to the Czech Association of Tourists for 2000 Czechoslovak crowns and now it belongs to the state. Since the 1930s the gradual restoration works continue until this day. == References == * Točník Castle Category:Castles in the Czech Republic Category:Beroun District Category:Castles in the Central Bohemian Region ","title":"Točník Castle"},{"id":"35289501","text":"Aman Nath (born 1951) is an Indian writer, hotelier, and architectural restorer. He is the co-founder and co-chairman of the Neemrana Hotels chain, along with Francis Wacziarg. Both are today credited for pioneering the heritage hotels movement in India. They started in 1991. Since then, they have acquired over 25 heritage properties and converted them into heritage hotels after restoration. Nath has published several illustrated books on Rajasthan and Indian arts. In June 2016, Nath and five others, all members of the LGBT community themselves, filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court of India challenging Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. This resulted in the 2018 landmark judgment in Navtej Singh Johar and others v. Union of India in which the Supreme Court unanimously declared the law unconstitutional \\"in so far as it criminalises consensual sexual conduct between adults of the same sex\\". ==Early life and education== Born and brought up in New Delhi, Aman Nath's family migrated from Lahore, Pakistan during the partition of India to settle in Delhi. He completed his education with a post-graduate degree in medieval Indian history from Delhi University.Pande, Alka (1 August 1999). \\"A new lease of life\\". The Hindu. He also has an adopted daughter named Aadya Nath. ==Career== Neemrana Fort Palace hotel, at Neemrana, Alwar district Rajasthan, the first property of Neemrana Hotels, opened 1991 Aman Nath with his book Jaipur: The last Destination Nath started his career as a copywriter and graphic designer in advertising. He was one of the founding members of INTACH, a heritage and conservation organisation, established in 1984. He became the arts editor for the magazine India Today, and later remained curator of \\"Art Today\\"—an art gallery of the India Today group, situated at Connaught Place, New Delhi—for seven years. Meanwhile, he started publishing books on history and heritage, including \\"Jaipur: the Last Destination\\", \\"Arts and Crafts of Rajasthan\\", and \\"Dome Over India: Rashtrapati Bhavan.\\". He first came across the ruined 15th-century Neemarana Fort, about 120 km from Delhi, in 1981 while researching for a book on Shekhawati painting and frescoes with Francis Wacziarg, former French diplomat and resident of India since 1969. After restoring two havelis in Rajasthan, they had developed enough expertise to take on the fort. Thus in 1986, they acquired the fort and, after restoration, a 12-room heritage hotel was opened in 1991. Over the years, they have acquired many heritage forts and palaces and converted them into successful heritage hotels, including Neemrana Fort Palace, Hill Fort Kesroli, Pataudi Palace, and Baradari Palace in Patiala. In 2011, Neemrana Hotels had 25 properties in 17 locations. Nath lives in the Nizamuddin East area of New Delhi. ==Works== * Rajasthan: the painted walls of Shekhavati, with Francis Wacziarg.

They are created because of a pedagogical choice of a school or school district. They are different from split classes which are formed when there are too many students for one class – but not enough to form two classes of the same grade level. Composite classes are more common in smaller schools; an extreme form is the one-room school. Studies of the performance of students in composite classes shows their academic performance is not substantially different from those in single-grade classrooms; instead, outcomes tend to be a function of the teacher's performance. ==History and prevalence== Multi-age schooling originated in one-room schoolhouses during the 19th century. It became less common in the 20th century with the rise of mainstream schooling. However, multi-age schooling had a resurgence in the 1960s. Approximately one third of all classes across the world are multigrade classes. “In Canada, more than 20 percent of students are registered in split classes, and that number is growing. Around the world, split classes are also a growing phenomenon in countries as diverse as Australia, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands.” (Kelly, 2015) The reasoning behind multi-age classrooms is distinct from that of split classes. While split classes are created when there are not enough students to form two separate single age classes, multi- age classes are intentionally formed to create a mixed age, diverse learning environment. This is an important distinction, as the reason for creating a split class or multi-age class will dictate what kinds of teaching strategies and pedagogy is applied in the classroom, which will in turn impact student outcomes. For a given number of students, composite classes allow greater administrative flexibility in allocating students to classes. This allows gender balancing, matching of student needs to teaching expertise, and balancing class sizes. By allocating children to classes according to specific learning needs, it is possible to arrange classes with narrower ranges of abilities. Schools composed exclusively of composite classes are increasingly common in Australian primary school education; they are not uncommon in New Zealand. Composite classes often meet resistance, with parents often believing that their child is disadvantaged by being in one. This perception is often regardless of whether their child would be in the younger or older cohort. Advocates of multi-age classrooms point to the lack of age stratification in workplaces, families or other social environments as a reason to create a similar environment in the classroom. ==Cited benefits== Social benefits often cited are: *Older children in a composite class get more leadership opportunities and frequently build self-esteem as a sort or role model to the younger class mates. Younger children aspire to do work like the older children in the class. *The ability for a child to be educated by the one teacher for two years, creating a stronger relationship. Educational benefits often cited are: *Because literacy and numeracy is taught in ability groups, teachers need heightened awareness of individual student's capabilities – they must think of children as individuals. *The techniques of classroom teaching and of individual teaching can be still applied. *Learning by teaching occurs when students at different stages of learning can help each other with their work; children resolve differences in understanding of material. as reported in *Composite classes provide a range of levels of work, so the needs of both talented children and slower learners can be catered for, while providing a supportive environment for both. At any one time, both composite and single- level classes have groups of students at a variety of levels. This is part of the normal delivery of the curriculum. Education expectations are set at curriculum levels which span across two years; for example, see the Victorian Essential Learning Standards. Contemporary teaching and learning materials are developed for multi-age classes. By using them, teachers can introduce core concepts to the whole classroom, and then differentiate instruction for the range of learners in the classroom.  Other considerations  The students will be of a greater range of size, age and maturity which can have both positive and negative implications particularly in class sporting activities and playground interaction. ==See also== *Age segregation in schools *Class- size reduction *One-room school *Sudbury schools, schools that are completely age-mixed from age four through high school.

Following two New Year's shows December 31 and January 1 at Schubas Tavern in Chicago, the band decided to discontinue touring in support of Post-Nothing, and return to Vancouver to begin work on a new album.Warwick, Kevin. “Early Warnings Roundup”, Chicago Reader, 04 November 2010.

November 15, 2013 accessed January 22, 2014. The duo cited disillusion with Vancouver, as well as the difficulty of returning to a sedentary lifestyle following two years of continuous touring, as the primary motivations for the move.Kane, Siobhán \\"Japandroids: It Can Start To Feel Like Work\\" . Thumped. October 23, 2013 accessed January 22, 2014.

The band has said they intended for the album to capture the spirit and energy of their live shows, thus foregoing standard studio techniques such as double tracking and overdubbing, while consciously taking into account the perceived reaction of their audience to hearing the songs live in concert. On recording the album, guitarist Brian King said \\"Technically speaking, the process for recording Celebration Rock was almost identical to that of our previous records: same studio, same engineer, same equipment, same techniques, etc. To me, the progression lies in the songwriting, the captured performances, and the mixing/production of the album, all of which are simply reflections of our shared knowledge and experience since recording Post-Nothing.\\"Stanley, Carl Louder Than War Interview: Japandroids. Louder Than War. October 11, 2012 accessed January 22, 2014. In an interview with Pitchfork, drummer Dave Prowse cited Appetite for Destruction as a specific influence on the album's sequencing. Rather than having a traditional ‘Side A’ and ‘Side B’ structure, Appetite For Destruction is split into ‘G’ and ‘R’ sides: the former 'Gun' side dealing with violence and debauchery (‘Welcome To The Jungle’, ‘Paradise City’), while the latter 'Roses' side focused on love and sex (‘Sweet Child o' Mine’, ‘Rocket Queen’). As King further explained, \\"We had this idea of the album having two sides, where [like Appetite For Destruction] ‘Side A’ is super-intense and ‘Side B’ is softer and poppier.\\" Music The music on Celebration Rock has been described as \\"one part classic rock, one part punk\\", due to the blending of classic rock influences such as Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty, with punk rock influences such as The Replacements and Hüsker Dü.Devlin, Mike \\"Why Japandroids should win the Polaris Prize\\", CBC Music, July 30, 2012 accessed January 22, 2014.Rubin, Mike \\"Loud Enough to Be Heard in Another Country\\", The New York Times, June 15, 2012 accessed January 22, 2014.Gormely, Ian \\"Review: Japandroids - Celebration Rock\\", Exclaim!, May 29, 2012 accessed January 22, 2014.

It's a beefy, pop- conscious punk record in the mold of Nevermind, and it's destined to become, like White Blood Cells, an important battle in the never-ending war to end bass playing as we know it.\\"Hyden, Steven \\"Japandroids and The Beach Boys try to recapture rock's lost youth\\", Grantland, June 6, 2012 accessed January 22, 2014.

The song \\"The Nights of Wine and Roses\\" is an homage to The Dream Syndicate song \\"The Days of Wine and Roses\\". Lyrics Lyrically, Celebration Rock has been described as a callback to classic rock conventions for its use of universal, mythic rock & roll language, including the use of contrasting themes such as good and evil, heaven and hell, life and death, young and old, etc. As Ian Cohen of Pitchfork noted, \\"Japandroids have gone from having almost none at all [lyrics] to packing their songs with an astonishing command of legend and literalism that all but dares you to feel something.\\" Regarding his use of language and themes, King stated: King has cited the novel Under The Volcano by Malcolm Lowry as a primary influence, inspiring him to try using more descriptive and poetic language in his lyrics: \\"In retrospect, the only work I can see reflected in the lyrics of Celebration Rock is Under The Volcano by Malcolm Lowry, a book I read twice during 2010-2011.\\"Adams, Jacob \\"Interview: Japandroids\\" , Spectrum Culture, June 12, 2012 accessed January 22, 2014. ==Release and promotion== On March 26, 2012, Japandroids announced that their second album Celebration Rock would be released by Polyvinyl on June 5, 2012,Dombal, Ryan.

Where Post-Nothing melts into a hazy dream, Celebration Rock does exactly what it claims to do—it burns on and on like the best sort of party.\\" Not all reviews were positive, however. NMEs Alex Denney gave Celebration Rock a mixed review, writing \\"Japandroids know how to bring the ruckus.

In 1336, the house of Luxembourg acquired Žebrák and in 1346, Jindřich of the Luxembourg house started renovating it. He later gave the castle to Karel IV, who became the Holy Roman Emperor shortly afterwards. Karel's son Václav IV liked the castle very much, but after the large fire in 1395, he built a more strategically positioned castle above it. During the Hussite wars, the Hussite army unsuccessfully besieged Žebrák and Točník and then proceeded to burn down the towns Točník and Hořovice. In 1532, another fire struck the castle, but this time, nobody bothered renovating it. In the year 1923, the castle was sold to the Czech Association of Tourists for 8000 crowns and now it belongs to the state. == References == Category:Castles in the Czech Republic Category:Populated places in the Beroun District Category:Castles in the Central Bohemian Region Category:Tourist attractions in the Central Bohemian Region ","title":"Žebrák Castle"},{"id":"35289707","text":"Midway is a ghost town in Fulton County, Illinois, United States.

It is the largest railway station in Jharkhand, handling over 100 trains and 100,000+ passengers every day. Dhanbad is also the headquarters of the Dhanbad Rail Division of the East Central Railway zone. Grand Chord rail-line that connects Howrah and New Delhi passes through Dhanbad junction. Dhanbad is located at . It has an elevation of . One of the largest and busiest railway junctions, it is arguably the most important station on the Grand Chord. In fact Dhanbad is the junction at which the Grand Chord really diverges from the CIC section. CIC rail line starts from Dhanbad and ends at Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh. Besides the CIC section there was a direct line to Ranchi which goes through Bokaro and Chandrapura. Most trains bound for Ranchi take this route. Dhanbad has a rail connectivity with the other major parts of the country such as Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Kochi, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Jabalpur, Jaipur, Nagpur, Pune, Guwahati, Jamshedpur, Daltonganj etc. Another rail line passing through the district, starts at Kharagpur and ends at Gomoh, this rail line comes under South Eastern Railway. Dhanbad is connected with most of the states through rail network. Every train passing through Dhanbad has a stop here. This Station is facing a serious problem of connectivity. And losing its importance after closure of Dhanbad–Chandrapura rail line. Platform 6-7 is fading away now. but Mahuda Junction is just 19 km by road become the substitution for Dhanbad and nearby places for different trains after closure of Chandrapura Dhanbad line. There used to be another railway line from Dhanbad connecting it to Jharia and Pathardih. The line used to intersect the CIC section, requiring a diamond crossing. Now that the line has been dis- mantled, the Diamond Crossing is no longer operational. Previously when there were much less trains from Ranchi and adjoining areas, Dhanbad along with Tatanagar railway station served as the main railway stations for the entire state of Jharkhand. ==Overview== The entire belt between Durgapur (158 km from Howrah), and all the way up to Dhanbad and beyond is industrialized. Apart from factories, there are many coalmines, some closed now, and some with fires burning deep in the mineshafts. The mining area extends for a large area, mostly to the south of the tracks. Quite a portion of the track passes through cuttings, where the surrounding area is higher than the track level, resulting in the profusion of characteristic small masonry bridges crossing the tracks.\\" This description is from \\"Gomoh loco shed and CLW trip record\\" by Samit Roychoudhury. ==History== The East Indian Railway Company extended its lines to Katrasgarh via Dhanbad in 1894. In the Railways in Jharia Coalfield, amongst the major sections of EIR were the Dhanbad-Phularitand section (21.6 km) opened in 1894 to Katrasgarh and extended to Phularitand in 1924, and the Dhanbad-Pathardih section opened in 1903. ;New developments In February 2012, The Indian Railways had planned to set up a Railway Station Development Corporation (RSDC) that will work on improving the major railway stations including Dhanbad Junction by building and developing Restaurants, shopping areas and food plaza for commercial business and improving passenger amenities ==Electrification== The Kumardhubi-Dhanbad, Pradhankhanta-Pathardih and Dhanbad-Gomoh sectors were electrified in 1960–61. ==Facilities== The station houses all the major facilities like waiting rooms, computerized reservation facility, dormitory, retiring rooms, cafeteria, bookshop, food plaza etc. Existing facilities are being revamped for developing it as model station. The Railway station is a divisional headquarters of East Central Railway and houses a number of non-passenger related facilities like loco sheds, washing lines etc. in its premises. From 21 November 2016 free RailWire WiFi facility is also available. If You have to come on Manaitand and Joraphatak Area then come across the Platform No. 7 & If You have to reach central area of Dhanbad then come across the Platform No. 1 main gate. You can also get various types of Magazines, NewsPapers, and more facilities on Platform No. 1,2 & 3\\\\. Escalator has been installed in platform 2 and 3 at the station. This proves to be of high help to the senior citizens and the handicapped. ==Transport and connectivity== Dhanbad station is very well connected by roadways. There is a bus stand just outside the railway station, where buses for nearby cities like Kolkata, Jamshedpur, Ranchi, Bokaro, Asansol and Durgapur are easily available. Outside the station, there is a taxi stand wherein a lot of taxis are always available. Dhanbad along with Ranchi and Jamshedpur were provided with buses under JNNURM scheme, for city transportation. These buses can be used for local transportation. Autos remain the mainstay of civilian transport in the city. These autos can be used to travel throughout the length of the city, using very nominal fares. ==Significance== Dhanbad Jn is a Category A1, station as well as the divisional headquarters. It is the largest station in the adjoining area, and every train has a halt here. Lying centrally on the Grand Chord it is flanked by Gaya Junction on the Delhi side and Asansol railway station on the Howrah side. It is not uncommon to find long-distance trains getting their locomotives and rakes (occasionally) changed here. All the Duronto Express passing through Dhanbad have a technical stoppage here. Due to shortage in spaces, Dhanbad does-not have any loco-shed at present. It used to have a steam loco shed earlier. It has a trip loco shed at its outer section, has its electric loco shed at Gomoh and its diesel loco shed at Patratu. Being the largest station in the area it finds a very heavy patronage and a huge number of passengers use this station every day. A lot of people from adjoining districts like Bokaro, Koderma, Giridih come to Dhanbad early morning to catch the 'morning trains' to various destinations like Kolkata, Durgapur, Jamshedpur, Ranchi, Patna, Burdwan and Gaya. Dhanbad also became the 1st station in the country to have an AC double-decker express running till which is now discontinued. ==Trains== Dhanbad is the second most profitable division after Mumbai to Indian Railway in terms of revenue generation. Dhanbad Junction's location on the Delhi Kolkata Grand chord route, makes it served by numerous express and superfast trains from all over the country. Several electrified local passenger trains also run from Dhanbad to neighbouring destinations at regular intervals. ==See also== * Dhanbad ==References * Category:Railway stations in Dhanbad district Category:Dhanbad railway division Category:Transport in Dhanbad Category:Railway junction stations in Jharkhand Category:Railway stations opened in 1894 ","title":"Dhanbad Junction railway station"},{"id":"35289736","text":"The Papua New Guinea women's national rugby sevens team represents Papua New Guinea in international rugby sevens tournaments, particularly the Oceania Women's Sevens Championship and Pacific Games.

The food of the Hazara people is strongly influenced by Central Asian, Persian and South Asian cuisines and shares similarities with neighboring regional cuisines in Afghanistan and Central Asia. However, there are certain dishes, culinary methods and styles of cooking that are unique to the Hazara people. The Hazara people have a hospitable dining etiquette. In Hazaragi culture, it is customary to prepare special food for guests, and to honor them with the best seats during meal times. Most Hazaras eat food with their hands, as opposed to using cutlery and dining utensils such as forks, knives or spoons. The diet of the Hazara people is largely based on the intake of high-protein foods such as meats and dairy products. They use large amounts of oil in their cooking. A typical Hazara meal/dining course normally consists of cooking one type of food or dish, rather than a wide selection. However, in large formal gatherings or during the presence of guests, a variety of foods may be cooked in the household.Hazaras at Everyculture.com Hazara cuisine is largely centred on bread. There are three main types of breads consumed by Hazara people:Central Asian Cultural Intelligence for Military Operations: Hazara in Afghanistan, p. 21 * Tawa bread, baked on hot plates * Tandoor bread, which is baked on a sunken oven known as the \\"tandoor\\" * Nan-buta bread, a thick, brick-sized bread. Rice is less frequent in rural Hazara cuisine due to its expense. Tea is a popular beverage among the Hazara people. Fruits and vegetables are only consumed when in season. ==Dishes== Popular Hazaragi dishes include: * Bolani or Pirki basically like paratha, made of boiled potatoes, spring onions or gandana (a vegetable in between a leek and a scallion/spring onion), garlic, salt and black pepper. * Shir Rogho - Hot milk tea with butter added. * Aash - Traditional Hazaragi Aash is plain noodles with Kashk/Ayran (yogurt), fresh mint and salt. Also in Hazarajat, a powder called \\"Pudina\\" (a plant, closely related to mint that grows only in Bamyan) is added on top. * Dalda (boiled crushed wheat served with melted desi ghee or butter with brown fried onions) * Qurti * Ogra * Ashak and Mantu (dumplings) * Naan Butta * Changali or Malida is basically a dessert but is mostly served with black or green tea for breakfast. * Shola * Halwa e Samanak (also called Halwa e Sia or Surkh) is a mixture of flour, germinated wheat and water which is fried in oil and then simmered for four hours to harden. It tastes sweet even though no sugar is added. * Aw joshak * Qabardagh (also called Surk Kada in some regions) is meat, in preference ribs, that is fried with garlic and salt and later steamed. * Pai'cha ia is a wintertime speciality of boiled cow or sheep parts, which might include the head or/and feet. Onion, garlic, salt, oil and wheat berries are added, sometimes lentils or other legumes are also added. It is put to simmer for hours on low heat. This is very rich in gelatin and minerals. •Sheer Brinj (sheer = milk), (brinj = rice) ==See also== * Afghan cuisine * Pashtun cuisine * Tajik cuisine * Hazaragi culture ==References== Category:Afghan cuisine Category:Cuisine by ethnicity ","title":"Hazaragi cuisine"},{"id":"35289866","text":"The Pinochet File is a National Security Archive book written by Peter Kornbluh covering over approximately two decades of declassified documents, from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), White House, and United States Department of State, regarding American covert activities in Chile. It is based on more than 24,000 previously classified documents that were released as part of the Chilean Declassification Project during the Clinton administration, between June 1999 and June 2000. == Significance == The Pinochet File was selected as one of \\"The Best Books of 2003\\" in the nonfiction category by the Los Angeles Times. The New Yorker said, \\"The evidence that Kornbluh has gathered is overwhelming.\\" in its review. The Newsweek review of The Pinochet File describes it as \\"...actually two distinct but intersecting books. The first is a narrative account of the Nixon administration's involvement in Chile. Its mission was to make sure that Allende's election in 1970 didn't serve as a model for leftist candidates elsewhere. The second consists of the reproduction of hundreds of salient intelligence documents released in 1999 and 2000 in response to requests by President Bill Clinton.\\" The inclusion of key source documents allows the reader not only to corroborate Kornbluh's findings, but to acquire a flavor of the extent of U.S. covert activities within Chile, and to understand the tenor of conversation in the White House and CIA regarding Salvador Allende's presidency. While the U.S. claimed to support Chile and its democratic election process, the documents show intricate and extensive attempts first to prevent Allende from being elected, and then to overthrow him with a coup d'état. The coup d'état required first removing the commander in chief of the Chilean armed forces (General René Schneider), who opposed military interference in political situations; he was assassinated by CIA-funded coup plotters (retired General Roberto Viaux and active duty General Camilo Valenzuela). Once Augusto Pinochet took power, his human rights violations were tolerated, even though the U.S. knew that thousands of people had been detained and American citizens Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi murdered. The CIA fostered an extensive cover-up of its involvement in fomenting the coup, including dissembling to the Church Committee. The White House also withheld key documents. Subsequently, the role of the US in this period of history was not correctly understood based solely on the findings released at that time. Furthermore, extensive black propaganda, especially in El Mercurio, shaped world perceptions of Allende, essentially painting him as a Communist pawn and portraying the wreckage of the Chilean economy as due to his decisions. In contrast, the declassified documents show that Richard Nixon enacted an \\"invisible blockade\\" in concert with American multinational corporations and international banking organizations, which were pressured to withhold loan refinancing. Consequently, much of the history that has been written without access to these documents may need to be reexamined, as Kornbluh discusses in the book's introduction: == Declassified documents reproduced in the book == The inclusion of key source documents provide a rare behind-the-scenes view of covert regime change in operation. Key documents from the CIA, United States National Security Council (NSC), White House, DIA, and State Department were declassified in the year 2000. The more than 24,000 records correspond to an average of about three records per day gathered over two decades and Kornbluh’s analysis was not complete and in print until 2003. Reports based on documents released prior to 2000 are necessarily incomplete and hew more closely to the interpretation the Nixon White House disseminated via its black propaganda programs in Chile. Not all of the documents included are from the CIA. The book reproduces 114 documents, using 237 pages, from the following sources: * Central Intelligence Agency, 37 documents. * United States Department of State, 22 documents. * United States Embassy, 15 documents. * U.S. National Security Council, 10 documents. * Defense Intelligence Agency, 10 documents. * Federal Bureau of Investigation, 6 documents. * The White House, 5 documents. * Secretary of State, 3 documents. * Department of Defense, 2 documents * Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional, 2 documents. * Treasury Department, 1 document. * Bow Street Magistrates Court, 1 document. == Notes  References == *Hitchens, Christopher, \\"Why has he got away with it?\\", The Guardian, February 24, 2001. *Kornbluh, Peter, The Pinochet File: A Declassified Dossier on Atrocity and Accountability.

His maternal grandparents were king Valdemar II of Denmark and his second wife, Berengaria of Portugal; his paternal grandparents were Albert II and Matilda of Lusatia.  Reign  After his father died in 1266, Otto IV ruled Brandenburg-Stendal jointly with his older brother John II and his younger brother Conrad I. Otto IV emerged as the most prominent of the three. In 1269, Otto IV and his co-ruling brothers Conrad and John II accepted Duke Mestwin II of Pomerelia as their vassal (Treaty of Arnswalde). Later, the Duke of Pomerelia would resist Brandenburg sovereignty, leading to numerous feuds, the first of which erupted in 1278, when Mestwin militarily supported Bolesław the Pious against Brandenburg. In 1277, Otto tried to have his younger brother Eric elected as Archbishop of Magdeburg. However, the Lords of Querfurt, who were Burgraves of Magdeburg, also fielded a candidate. As a compromise, Günther I of Schwalenberg was appointed. This led to a protracted dispute between Otto and the chapter of Magdeburg Cathedral. During the Battle of Fohse, Magdeburg managed to capture Otto and lock him in a cage. Otto's councillor Johann von Buch paid a ransom of 4000 pounds silver to have him released. The dispute continued during the reign of Günther's successor Bernard III of Wölpe. During a fight in Staßfurt in 1280, Otto was hit by an arrow. Allegedly, he lived for a year with an arrow sticking out of his head, hence his nickname. It is not quite clear how long he walked around like that; one tradition says \\"for some time\\", another says \\"for many years\\". There are no written sources to resolve this.Reinhard Lebe: War Karl der Kahle wirklich kahl? Historische Beinamen und was dahinter steckt, 1990, Eric was finally appointed Bishop of Magdeburg in 1283, after Pope Martin IV had given his blessing. In 1278 he joined his uncle, King Ottokar II of Bohemia on a campaign in Hungary, where they clashed with Rudolph I of Germany. Ottokar II fell during the Battle on the Marchfeld in 1278. Otto IV became guardian for Ottokar's seven-year-old son Wenceslaus II. However, he held Wenclaus hostage in Spandau while his armies sacked Bohemia. Wencelaus was released in 1283, after Bohemia had paid a ransom and ceded some territory. Wencelaus later maintained cordial relations with Otto IV. The Peace of Rostock of a 1283 created an alliance led by the City of Lübeck, uniting the cities of Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund, Greifswald, Szczecin, Demmin, Anklam, Duke Bogislaw IV of Pomerania, Prince Wizlaw II of Rügen, and Duke John I of Saxony against Brandenburg. In the Treaty of Vierraden of 1284, Otto IV and his co-rulers returned the Pomerelian territories they had conquered earlier. In 1290, an internal dispute arose in Brandenburg between Otto IV of Brandenburg-Stendal and his cousin and co-ruler Otto V \\"the Long\\" of Brandenburg-Salzwedel, who made an alliance with the Piast dukes of Silesia. In 1294, the dispute escalated to an armed conflict. In 1295, King Adolph mediated and the conflict was resolved. Later that year, Otto IV made an alliance with Duke Otto II of Brunswick-Lüneburg. In 1292, after the death of King Rudolf, Otto had as elector supported the election of Adolf of Nassau as the new King, against the candidacy of Rudolf's son Albert of Austria. In this, Otto was in league with the Bohemian king (his former ward and prisoner Venceslas) who actually was instigator of anti-Habsburg stance and the candidacy of Adolf. In 1292, Otto IV purchased the Margraviate of Landsberg and in 1292 the County Palatine of Saxony, a territory in the Saale-Unstrut area. In 1303, he purchased Lusatia from Landgrave Dietrich IV. In 1296, Brandenburg began a war against King Przemysł II of Poland, who had occupied Pomerania, because Brandenburg also claimed sovereignty over Pomerania and Brandenburg wanted to have a port on the Baltic sea. This war was unsuccessful. In 1298, Otto IV participated in the overthrow of King Adolph, but not in the military campaign against him. Otto IV was also involved in feuds against Lord Nicholas I of Rostock, Prince Wizlaw II of Rügen, Dukes Henry I of Brunswick-Grubenhagen and Albert II of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Göttingen and the Bishops of Brandenburg and Havelberg. The conflict with the bishops culminated in an interdict being pronounced over him.  Chivalry  Otto IV was said to have lived his life after chivalric ideals. He was described as \\"one of the most brilliant and gallant princes of his time\\". His biography also suggests a rather combative character. He was also active as a minstrel; seven of his songs, written in an Upper German dialect, have been preserved. Compared to other compositions from his era, his pieces can be described as excellent.See: von Heinemann, p. 661 == Marriage == Monument for Otto IV on the Siegesallee Otto IV married twice, but died childless. In 1262, he married Heilwig, the daughter of Count John I of Holstein-Kiel and Elisabeth of Saxony.Theresa Earenfight, Queenship in Medieval Europe, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2013), 173. She died in 1305.

The match was played at the Bahrain National Stadium in Riffa, Bahrain. It was the biggest win for Bahrain, and the biggest defeat for Indonesia. This match is known for the investigation called for by FIFA afterwards. Before this match Bahrain needed to score nine goals in order to pass Qatar and to move on to the next round in qualifying. They also needed Qatar to lose their next match against Iran but due to an 83rd-minute equalizer the game finished 2–2 and thus Qatar progressed instead of Bahrain. == Background == Prior to the final matchday the table was: Before the game, Bahrain required a winning margin of nine goals to stand any chance of progressing to the next stage. Leading up to the game, Indonesia had lost all five matches to date in their qualification group, allowing 16 goals in the process. Internal conflict in the Football Association of Indonesia lead them to prevent all Indonesia Super League players from playing. They only sent players who play in the Indonesian Premier League, although Indonesia's regular, better, and more experienced national players play in the Indonesia Super League. Indonesia was understood to have fielded inexperienced players due to this situation. Prior to this match, Indonesia's record loss was 9–0, recorded in 1974 at the hands of Denmark. In the six previous meetings between the two teams, each team had won twice, with two matches having been drawn. Both teams had met earlier in this round at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta, with Bahrain winning 2–0. Prior to the qualification process, both teams last met at the same venue during the 2007 AFC Asian Cup group stage match on 10 July 2007. Hosts Indonesia won 2–1, avenging the 3–1 defeat at the same stage nearly three years earlier. ==Match summary== Indonesia started the game with an inexperienced side, with no player holding more than 12 international caps. This was also the international debut for eight players in the Indonesia starting line up (except Syamsidar, Irfan Bachdim, and Ferdinand Sinaga). Indonesia suffered an early setback when their goalkeeper Syamsidar was shown the red card in the first three minutes. After Bahrain scored the resultant penalty, they went on to be awarded a total of four penalties in the match, including three in the first half, although substitute Indonesia goalkeeper Andi Muhammad Guntur managed to save two of the four kicks. ==Match details== { width=\\"100%\\" valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" colspan=\\"4\\"BAHRAIN: - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Sayed Jaffer -  2 Waleed Al Hayam -  3Abdulla Marzooq -  4 Sayed Dhiya -  5Saleh Abdulhameed -  7Ali Abdulwahab -  10 Mohammed Tayeb Al Alawi -  11 Ismail Abdul-Latif -  13 Mahmood Abdulrahman   -  14Salman Isa -  15Abdullah Omar - colspan=3Substitutes: -  6Dawood Saad -  8 Hassan Jameel -  9Hamad Al Bannki -  12Ali Norooz Hasan -  16Isa Moosa -  17Mohamed Duaij -  18 Fahad Hasan   -  19 Ahmed Mubarak Al Khattal -  20 Sami Mohammed -  21 Hamad Ebrahim - GK 22 Abbas Ahmed Khamis -  23 Ebrahim Al Obaildi - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Peter Taylor } valign=\\"top\\" width=\\"50%\\" { style=\\"font-size: 90%\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"0\\" align=center colspan=\\"4\\"INDONESIA: - !width=25 !!width=25 - GK 1 Syamsidar  - LM 6Rendy Irawan - CM 8 Muhammad Taufiq - CF 10Irfan Bachdim - CM 11 Aditya Putra Dewa   - CB 13Gunawan Cahyo   - RB 14Hengky Ardiles - LB 15Diego Michiels  - CF 17Ferdinand Sinaga - RM 19Slamet Nurcahyo   - CB 22Abdul Rahman  - colspan=3Substitutes: - DF 2Sigit Meiko Susanto - MF 7 Ricky Ohorella   - FW 9 Samsul Arif - GK 12 Andi Muhammad Guntur   - DF 16 Rasul Zainuddin - MF 21 Abdul Abanda Rahman - DF 23 Wahyu Wijiastanto   - colspan=3Manager: - colspan=4 Aji Santoso } } { width=100% style=\\"font-size: 90%\\"  Assistant referees: Ziad Birak (Lebanon) Hadi El Kassar (Lebanon) Fourth official: Radwan Ghandour (Lebanon) } ==Post match== The final table was as follows: Following the match, Indonesia finished the third round with the worst overall record of the 20 competing teams, having scored no points at all in the round while conceding a total of 26 goals.

They released 10 albums. Its current members are Bagus (vocals and bass), Eno (drums), and Coki (guitar). ==Career== In November 1992, Bagus formed Netral along with Bimo and Miten. The band released a self-titled album in 1994, with punk sounds dominant. It released another album, Wa.. Lah, in 1995. The lyrics are random and simple, combined with a \\"naughty\\" rock style. Its third album, Tidak Enak, was released in 1997, with a fourth, Album Minggu Ini, released the following year. After that, Bimo quit the band and was replaced by Eno. In 1999, Miten was replaced by Coki. The band then released Paten, which was followed by Oke Deh in 2001. In 2003, it released Kancut. In 2005, Netral released two albums. Hitam, released on 7 February 2005, gave a \\"hard\\" and \\"dark\\" impression and consisted of seven tracks. The lyrics on \\"Bom\\" discuss bombings that terrorize people. \\"Atas Nama\\" explains persons acting on behalf of the public and love. The lyrics in \\"Koma\\" are about someone who finds inspiration in a coma, while the first track, \\"Haru Biru\\", tells about someone's journey through life. It was sold through fan bases, distros, and music magazines; only 7000 copies were published. Putih, a \\"softer\\" album, was released four months later. The first track, \\"Terbang Tenggelam\\", tells about someone's purposeless love journey. Since these albums, Netral has released its albums through the indie label Kancut Records. The band released its ninth album, entitled 9th, in July 2007. One of the songs, \\"Cinta Gila\\", has the theme of love and is about a woman who falls in love with a drummer of a band. A video clip was made for this song to improve album sales. The Story Of was released in 2009. The song \\"Cipta Karya Jaya Rasa\\" has been described as full of rock, while \\"Hari Yang Indah\\" is more pop and jazzy. On \\"Api\\", the band invites listeners to enjoy life. \\"Seluas Samudera\\" describes a sincere and open heart, while \\"Kecoa dan Kupu-kupu\\" describes a sincere love and betrayal. The band also rearranged \\"Hari Merdeka\\", a medium tempo patriotic song, as a rock song. In 2009, Netral released a song entitled \\"Garuda Di Dadaku\\" as part of a soundtrack for the film of the same name. Band members had difficulty when writing the lyrics and recording the song. In late 2009, the lyrics of the song were edited and the song renamed as \\"KPK Di Dadaku\\" to defend the government agency of eradication of corruption, which at the time was trouble. In 2015, Netral officially changed its name to \\"NTRL\\". ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 1992 Category:Indonesian punk rock groups Category:Indonesian rock music groups Category:1992 establishments in Indonesia ","title":"NTRL"},{"id":"35290164","text":"Davyd Tengizovich Saldadze (born February 15, 1978) is an Uzbekistani wrestler of Georgian origin, he also wrestled for Ukraine and won the Silver medal in the Men's Greco-Roman 97kg in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney for Ukraine.

It can be of Jewish, English, French, German, Dutch, Irish, Welsh, Cornish, Breton, and other origins. It is derived from the Hebrew personal name Avraham, borne by the biblical patriarch Abraham, revered by Jews as a founding father of the Jewish people (Gen. 11-25), and by Muslims as founder of all Semitic peoples (see Abraham).Hanks, Dictionary of American Family Names, page 4 The name is explained in Genesis 17:5 as being derived from the Hebrew av hamon goyim \\"father of a multitude of nations\\". It was commonly used as a given name among Christians in the Middle Ages, and has always been a popular Jewish given name.Hanks & Hodges, Oxford Dictionary of Names, page 2 The English name Abram is often a short form of Abraham, but it can also be a shortened version of Adburgham, which comes from a place name.Hanks & Hodges, Oxford Dictionary of Names, page 4 As an Irish name, it was adopted as an approximation (in sound, not meaning) of the Gaelic name Mac an Bhreitheamhan \\"son of the judge\\".Hanks, Dictionary of American Family Names, page 4 The German name Brahm is often a short form of Abraham, but it can also be a topographic name signifying someone who lived near a bramble thicket (from the Middle High German brāme).Hanks & Hodges, Oxford Dictionary of Names, page 71 The name Braham has been used as an Anglicization of both Abraham and its patronymic Abrahams by Ashkenazi Jews in the British Isles (see Braham).

It was built in 1657 in response to the wishes of the Capuchin friars, Gioacchino da Cassano and Andrea da Rho. The chapels, dedicated to the Via Crucis, are positioned along a devotional route which starts on the outskirts of Domodossola and ends at the summit of Mount Mattarella. The sanctuary on the summit was consecrated in 1690 and in 1828 the philosopher priest, Antonio Rosmini, founded the Institute of Charity. Over the centuries the Sacred Mountain has undergone various modifications, rebuilding and restoration including, in 1957, the wooden statues in chapels 3, 5, 6 and 7.

It is located about northwest of the hamlet of Marten River on an island in north-central Cross Lake. Dating back to the early 1900s, it is one of the oldest mines in the municipality of Temagami. ==History== The mine was discovered in 1907 when attention was focused there by the discovery of a quartz vein in rocks that closely resembled those in the town of Cobalt further north, which was undergoing a silver rush at the time. Development consisted of small open pits and sinking of a inclined shaft along the quartz vein. At least five small drifts were created off the shaft at the , and levels. Small shipments of sulfide ore, containing copper and lead with some gold and silver values, were made to a smelter. In 1955, Cross Lake Mining Company Limited dewatered the shaft for examination and four diamond drill holes were created from the surface. It was evident that good mineralization had been encountered in the shaft, judging from the lumps of high-grade ore found lying in the muck, consisting of copper and galena, and some was observed on the waste rock dump. Heavy mineralization of pyrite, chalcopyrite and galena was noted at two points at the bottom of the shaft. The richest collected sample assayed 5.03% copper, 2.39% lead, of gold and of silver across a mining width. ==See also== *List of mines in Temagami ==ReferencesCategory:Mines in Temagami Category:Surface mines in Canada Category:Underground mines in Canada Category:Copper mines in Canada Category:Gold mines in Canada Category:Lead mines in Canada Category:Silver mines in Canada ","title":"Priest Mine"},{"id":"35290290","text":"Illya Fedorovych Mate (spelled Maté, , born 6 October 1956) is a retired Soviet Ukrainian freestyle wrestler.

Medicine spent much of her life researching, teaching, and serving Native communities, primarily in the fields of bilingual education, addiction and recovery, mental health, tribal identity, and women's, children's, and LGBT community issues. == Early life == Medicine was born on the Standing Rock Reservation in Wakpala, South Dakota on the 1st of August, 1923. == Education == Medicine received her BA in anthropology at South Dakota State University in 1945, and her MA in both Sociology and Anthropology from Michigan State University in 1954. She completed her Ph.D in 1983 at the University of Wisconsin. == Career == Medicine studied the human behaviors involved in racism and linguistic discrimination, in both academia and social anthropology. Much of her work focused on the resurgence, survivance, and expansion of Indigenous languages and culture. Medicine was known internationally for her work with students and faculty, and over her 50 year career at campuses including Santo Domingo Pueblo Agency School, Flandreau Indian School, the University of British Columbia, Stanford University, Dartmouth College, Mount Royal College (now Mount Royal University), San Francisco State University, the University of Washington, the University of Montana and the University of South Dakota. In her book, Learning to Be an Anthropologist and Remaining Native, Medicine playfully attributed her multi- institutional career as a result of embracing the traditional roots of the Lakota: \\"as far as moving so often is concerned, I jokingly refer to the former nomadism of my people\\". Her lifelong commitment as a scholar and educator resulted in numerous publications, speeches, lectures, and studies, for many which Medicine received honourable accolades and awards recognizing her pursuits for equity in human rights. Medicine was actively involved in civil rights struggles in the Indigenous communities of Seattle, Vancouver, and Calgary. In 1974 Medicine testified alongside Vine Deloria Jr. as an expert witness in the federal case brought against those involved in the Wounded Knee incident. In 1984, Medicine was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board, a nonprofit organization built with the intent on \\"holding power accountable\\". In 1993-94 Medicine took a stand for her beliefs and respect for the role of women in Indigenous cultures by accepting a position in the Women's Branch of Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, seeing this as acting as a voice for the people to fight for the legal rights of Indigenous families. Medicine's commitment to social action did not end when she retired from her career as a teacher and scholar in the early 1990s. Upon returning to her home on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in South Dakota she assisted in the efforts to build a new public school for the community. She also sat on the Pardon Board and the Wakpala- Smee School District School board. == Death == Beatrice Medicine died during an emergency surgery on 19 December 2005, in Bismarck, North Dakota. In accordance with her wishes there was no funeral service. Her family requested that, rather than collect flowers for a gravesite, friends and family instead donate to the American Indian College Fund in Denver, Colorado. Medicine is survived by her sister Grace V Yardley, her son Ted Sitting Crow Garner, and her adopted daughter JoAllyn Archambault who is also an anthropologist. == Legacy == In 2006 AltaMira Press published Drinking and Sobriety Among the Lakota Sioux, a work they had been producing with Medicine in the days prior to her passing. This work examines the role of harmful Stereotypes of indigenous peoples of Canada and the United States in relation to alcoholism which Medicine originally presented in her 1969 article \\"The Changing Dakota Family and the Stresses Therein,\\" in The Pine Ridge Research Journal. In honour of Medicine and her lifelong dedication to education, The Society for Applied Anthropology (SfAA) created the Bea Medicine Award, a scholarship travel grant of $500, awarded to up to four students who are either completing their undergraduate or graduate studies, to assist in attending the Annual Meeting of the SfAA. == Awards == * (1991) Distinguished Service Award from the American Anthropological Association. * (1996) Bronislaw Malinowski Award from the Society for Applied Anthropology. * (2005) George and Louise Spindler Award for Education in Anthropology from the American Anthropological Association. * Ohana Award from the American Counseling Association]. * Outstanding Woman of Color Award from the National Institute of Women of Color. * Honoring Our Allies Award from the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. ==Published work==  Collaborative works  * (1973). \\"The Native American\\" in Don Speigel and Patricia Keith-Speigel eds.

She combines Polish and Eastern European folk music, Romani music and gypsy jazz with world music, Latin music, pop, worldbeat, Americana and reggae. In 2001, Megitza emigrated to Chicago, where she appeared in charity concerts and events such as Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity and where she promoted Polish culture. She began her professional career in 2008, when she formed the Megitza Quartet and released her debut album, Boleritza. She has since performed at the Milwaukee Avenue Arts Festival at the Jay Pritzker Pavilion, the 13th All Souls Jazz festival at the Chopin Theatre, the Chicago World Music Festival, and the Old Town School of Folk Music in Chicago. The Chicago Sun-Times has noted the quartet's \\"energetic\\" performances. According to the Chicago Tribune she and the group are primarily influenced by Eastern European folk, gypsy, Polish, and Greek music. Songs include \\"Boleritza\\", \\"Mamo te Mera\\", \\"Cisza\\", \\"17_14\\", and \\"What I Desire\\". == Biography == Megitza was born on November 27, 1984 in Zakopane, Poland. In 2001, she migrated to Chicago, where she has continued the cultivation of her Polish heritage, but also experimented with world music and gypsy music of Eastern Europe and Latin music. In 2003, Megitza was appointed the queen of the Polish Highlanders Alliance of North America. She organized a charity event, and proceeds were donated to orphanages in Poland. As a musician, Megitza has participated in charity concerts and events such as Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity. In 2004, Megitza received the highest score (126) at the Polish National intelligence quotient (IQ) contest in Chicago. She promotes the culture of Poland and Podhale in Chicago and the United States. Megitza is a self-taught vocalist and bass player. She began her career in 2008, when she formed the Megitza Quartet. The band is currently composed of Megitza on vocals and upright bass, Andreas Kapsalis on acoustic guitar, Marek Lichota on bayan (accordion), and Jamie Gallagher on drums and percussion. The Megitza Quartet is known for its high energy stage presence, and the quartet has been compared to artists such as Gypsy Kings, Ewa Demarczyk, Goran Bregović, Kayah and Lura. In 2008, Megitza released her debut album, Boleritza. The album includes traditional and original compositions. Roby Lakatos is a guest violinist on Boleritza, on two tracks: \\"Mamo Temera\\" and \\"17_14\\". Her original compositions are primarily influenced by folk music of Polish highlanders (gorals of Podhale), Romani music, Balkan folk and World music. The Chicago Tribune notes Eastern European folk and \\"gypsy, Greek, and Polish influences\\". Notable songs include \\"Boleritza\\", \\"Mamo te Mera\\", \\"Cisza\\" and \\"17_14\\". == Performances and reception == Megitza is regarded as an influential artist representing Poles abroad. She has made hundreds of concerts and appearances at major festivals in America, especially in Chicago, including the Old Town School of Folk Music in August 2009, the Lotus World Music and Arts Festival in September 2009, the Milwaukee Avenue Arts Festival at the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in March 2010, at the lakefront in Dawes Park in July 2010, the Chicago World Music Festival (an event presented by the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE), in partnership with the Chicago Office of Tourism and Culture (COTC) ), in September 2011, the Chicago Folk and Roots Festival in July 2011, the Chicago Summer Dance Festival, and Taste of Chicago, all in her adopted city. They also performed at the All Souls Jazz festival held at the Chopin Theatre of Chicago in November 2010, an event which Howard Reich of the Chicago Tribune said \\"Chicago's All Souls fest looks, feels and sounds like no other jazz soiree in this city\\". In July 2009 they performed the Slovak Roma wedding song \\"Mamko Moja\\" live on ABC7's \\"Chicagoing\\" with Bill Campbell. Time Out Chicago described her as a \\"fiery\\" singer and the band's music as \\"energetic Roma folk\\" when they performed at \\"Women's Global Voices\\" with the likes of Ugochi and The Afro Soul Ensemble in March 2012, a concert presented by Sound Culture honoring Women's History Month.\\" The Chicago Sun-Times has also noted the \\"energetic\\" performances of the quartet. The Sound Culture Center for Global Arts described Megitza as \\"a true concert revelation – an unusual voice, charisma and beauty\\", describing her music as \\"dynamic, vibrant, full of energy, uniting listeners of all ages.\\" Jazz Chicago said of the 2008 album, \\"Throughout, Babariaz's strong vocals engage the senses, while Lichota's romantic accordion is a treat as well. The blend of traditional folk music and originals are played and sung very well and make for an intriguing visit to the Old World.\\" Although Megitza mainly performs in the United States, in July 2012 she performed at the Jazz Fest Wien in Vienna, Austria, and the Montreux Jazz Festival in Montreux, Switzerland, before performing extensively in Poland. In Poland, the Megitza Quartet reached the finals of the fifth edition of Must Be the Music, and in 2015 the Megitza Trio entered the eighth season of Mam talent!, the Polish version of Got Talent, earning a \\"golden key\\" to advance directly to the semi-finals. ==Discography== Studio albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:15em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Album details - ! scope=\\"row\\" Boleritza  * Released: November 30, 2008 * Label: Megitza * Formats: CD, digital download - ! scope=\\"row\\" Legenda  * Released: July 1, 2012 * Label: Megitza * Formats: CD, digital download - ! scope=\\"row\\" Megitza  * Released: July 1, 2012 * Label: Megitza * Formats: CD, digital download - ! scope=\\"row\\" Dobra Nowina (Good Message) with Renata Przemyk  * Released: December 22, 2012 * Label: Megitza * Formats: CD, digital download - ! scope=\\"row\\" Mak with Andreas Kapsalis  * Released: October 2013 * Label: Megitza * Formats: CD } Music videos { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:15em;\\" Title ! scope=\\"col\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\"  Directed ! scope=\\"col\\"  Album - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"What I Desire\\" 2011 Ewa Uszpolewicz rowspan=3Megitza - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Beauty Rumelaj\\" rowspan=32012 Maciej Michalski - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Suspicious\\" Rafał Kawalec - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Jezus Malusieńki\\" with Renata Przemyk Maciej Michalski Dobra Nowina (Good Message) - ! scope=\\"row\\" \\"Teroz\\" 2014 Maciej Michalski, Piotr Smoleński — } == References  External links == * Megitza's Official Website * Megitza Quartet Category:Polish folk musicians Category:People from Zakopane Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Polish emigrants to the United States Category:Gypsy jazz musicians Category:World music singers Category:Double-bassists Category:Polish bass guitarists Category:Polish female singers Category:Polish folk singers Category:Polish jazz singers Category:Polish pop singers Category:English-language singers from Poland Category:Polish lyricists Category:Women bass guitarists Category:Women double-bassists Category:Guitarists from Chicago Category:21st-century Polish singers Category:21st-century women singers Category:21st-century double- bassists Category:21st-century bass guitarists ","title":"Megitza"},{"id":"35290477","text":"Maxime Teixeira was the defending champion.

Screening of chemical libraries of small molecules is then used to identify compounds that bind with high affinity to the target. The hits from these screens are then used as starting points for drug discovery. This method became popular after the sequencing of the human genome which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins. This method is the most widely used in drug discovery today.

Until the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian union it was used extensively for hunting and outdoor activities. It was given to Crown Prince Olav when he came of age July 2, 1924, by then Swedish Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf. The cottage was designed by the castellan Hjalmar Welhaven. Originally the Prince's cabin consisted of a big log house with eight rooms and a gallery. After it was donated to Crown Prince Olav several houses were added and the current royal couple has had even more cottages built. The original cabin and most of the other lodges that have been constructed are built of timber, and some with natural cladding. The walls are treated with tar.

It is common from Cape Town to Heidelberg, Western Cape, especially in forested areas. In scrub outside forested areas, it is replaced by Palystes superciliosus. It occurs mainly on plants, where it hunts insects. It has a body length of 17–22 mm. P. castaneus is the type species for the genus Palystes, and was first described by Pierre André Latreille in 1819. Spiders in the genus Palystes are commonly called rain spiders, or lizard-eating spiders. P. castaneus often appears in the home just before the onset of rain, where they hunt geckos (usually Afrogecko porphyreus). Males are regularly seen from August to December, probably looking for females. P. castaneus egg sacAfter mating in the early summer, the female constructs a round egg sac about 60–100 mm in size made of silk, with twigs and leaves woven into it. These egg sacs are commonly seen from about November to April. The female constructs the sac over 3–5 hours, then aggressively guards it until the spiderlings, who hatch inside the protective sac, chew their way out about three weeks later. Many gardeners are bitten by protective Palystes mothers during this period. Females will construct about three of these egg sacs over their two-year lives. Tachypompilus ignitus dragging Palystes prey (not P. castaneus) up a wallP. castaneus (and other Palystes spiders) are also commonly seen paralysed, being dragged by a large wasp called a Pompilid wasp. Sometimes the wasp will not be present. Pompilid wasps only hunt spiders, which they paralyse by stinging them. They then drag the spider back to their nest where they lay an egg on the spider, then seal the spider and the egg in. When the egg hatches, the larva eats the paralysed spider, keeping the spider alive as long as possible by eating peripheral flesh first, and saving the vital organs till last. By doing this, the spider stays fresh long enough for the wasp larva to mature and pupate. The Pompilid wasp species Tachypompilus ignitus is at least largely a specialist hunter of mature Palystes females. ==Gallery== File:Sparassidae_Palystes_castaneus_mature_female_9933s.jpgFemale P. castaneus File:Sparassidae_Palystes_castaneus_mature_female_9929s.jpgFemale P. castaneus File:Sparassidae Palystes castaneus mature female 9937s.jpgFemale P. castaneus ==References * Palystes castaneus on Iziko Museums' Biodivesity Explorer Category:Spiders of South Africa Category:Sparassidae Category:Spiders described in 1819 Category:Taxa named by Pierre André Latreille ","title":"Palystes castaneus"},{"id":"35290727","text":"Reuben Martin (1875 - April 17, 1946) was a farmer and political figure in Saskatchewan.

Sandler (10 January 1927 – 6 October 1998) was a British psychoanalyst within the Anna Freud Grouping – now the Contemporary Freudians – of the British Psychoanalytical Society; and is perhaps best known for what has been called his 'silent revolution' in re-aligning the concepts of the object relations school within the framework of ego psychology.Otto F. Kernberg, 'The Influence of Joseph Sandler's Work on Contemporary Psychoanalysis' ==Life== Born and educated in South Africa, including a medical degree, Sandler moved to London following fears around his anti- apartheid stance, where he completed his PhD in psychology at University College, London in 1950, before further training in medicine and psychoanalysis. He became a training analyst in 1955.Riccardo Steiner, 'Sandler, Joseph (1927–1998)' Sandler was editor of the International Journal of Psycho-Analysis from 1969 to 1978; and was elected President of the International Psychoanalytical Association in 1989. ==Theoretical openness== Sandler took an open, pragmatic approach to psychoanalytic theorising – something particularly important in the wake of the Controversial discussions which had left a three-way split inside the British Society. He took the view that 'we have a body of ideas, rather than a consistent whole, that constitutes psychoanalytic theory', and called for 'a greater degree of tolerance of concepts...created by people who have a different psychoanalytic background'Quoted in Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (1990) p. 184 – something that was of great importance in his rapprochement between Kleinian ideas and ego psychology. ==Safety== Sandler emphasised early in his work (1959) the importance of the feeling of safety, which he linked to early experiences of primary narcissism'R. J Perelberg, Psychoanalytic Understanding of Violence and Suicide (1999) p. 28 He noted however that the search for safety could act as a resistance in psychotherapy;C. Dare et al, The Patient and the Analyst (2011) p. 117 but also highlighted the role of a sense of trust in forging the therapeutic alliance.C. E. Newhill et al, Client Violence in Social Work Practice (2003) p. 8 ==Role responsiveness and actualisation== Sandler introduced the term actualisation into psychoanalysis from literary studies, to cover the process whereby past object-relationships are brought to life within the analytic setting.J. Sandler, 'Actualization and object relationships', Journal of Philadelphia Association for Psychoanalysis 4 (1977): 59–70 Through what he termed the free-floating (if controlled and moderated) 'role responsiveness' of the therapist, the latter was able to bring into being the unconscious fantasy of the patient and so expose it to light – becoming in the process someone a little different with each patient.Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (1990) p. 118-9 Sandler himself saw the process of actualisation as adumbrated in the 7th chapter of Freud's The Interpretation of Dreams;Peter Fonagy et al., Psychoanalysis on the Move (1999) p. 9 and similar concepts can be found in ego psychology, which speaks of the 'evocation' of a proxyPatrick Casement, On Learning from the Patient (London 1985) p. 100 and among post-Jungians with their talk of a 'complementary' countertransference.Mario Jacoby, The Analytic Encounter (1984) p. 41 Sandler's concept also connects with the ideas of acting out and acting in within the analytic session,Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (1990) p. 166 though Otto Kernberg emphasises specifically how Sandler differentiated actualisation from acting out.Otto F. Kernberg, 'The Influence of Joseph Sandler's Work on Contemporary Psychoanalysis' Sandler specifies several different types of actualisation, including delusive actualisation and symbolic actualisation.J. And A.-M. Sandler, Internal Objects Revisited (1998) p. 42 The concept of role responsiveness has subsequently been taken up more widely in British psychoanalysis,Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (1990) p. 8 and p. 165-6 as well as by intersubjective analysts, who see at least one aspect of countertransference as the therapist's reaction to the role the patient wishes to force upon them.Tamara Latawiec, When the Professional is Personal (2008) p. 21 Example A clear example of actualisation described shortly before Sandler's introduction of the term tells how, in an analytic encounter with a young man, one psychoanalyst – David Cooper – had \\"felt the progressive extrusion of his internalized mother into me, not as a theoretical construct but in actual experience\\".David Cooper, The Death of the Family (Penguin 1974) p. 114 ==On psychotherapy== Sandler considered that psychotherapy could in homely terms be thought of as a process of 'making friends' with unacceptable parts of oneself.Robert M.

It is the most common and widespread species in the genus Palystes. Its distribution ranges from KwaZulu-Natal province in the east, then westwards to the provinces of Mpumalanga, Limpopo, Gauteng and North West in the north, and Eastern Cape and Western Cape in the south. It has a body length of 15–36 mm and a leg span of up to 110mm. The species was first described by Ludwig Carl Christian Koch in 1875. Its preferred habitat is scrubland and savannah woodland. Spiders in the genus Palystes are commonly called rain spiders, or lizard-eating spiders. Palystes spiders will often enter homes before rain, where they will prey on geckos (usually Afrogecko porphyreus in Gauteng, the Western Cape, or Lygodactylus capensis in the eastern parts of southern Africa). Males are regularly seen from August to December, probably looking for females. P. castaneus, similar to P. superciliosus Common Rain Spider egg nest Tachypompilus ignitus dragging Palystes prey up a wall After mating in the early summer, the female constructs a round egg sac about 60–100 mm in size made of silk, with twigs and leaves woven into it. These egg sacs are commonly seen from about November to April. The female constructs the sac over 3–5 hours, then aggressively guards it until the spiderlings, who hatch inside the protective sac, chew their way out about three weeks later. Females will construct about three of these egg sacs over their two-year lives. Many gardeners are bitten by protective Palystes mothers during this period. The size of these spiders, combined with the yellow and black banding on the underside of the legs exposed when the spider is in threat pose, give them a fearsome appearance. An experiment was done in 1959 where a Palystes superciliosus was allowed to bite an adult guinea pig on the nose. The guinea pig died within 7 minutes, leading to a belief that the spider's venom was dangerous. However, further research on anaesthetized guinea pigs showed that the original guinea pig had actually died of shock, rather than as a result of the spider's venom. In humans the bite is no more dangerous than a bee sting. It causes a burning sensation, and swelling which lasts for a few days. Recovery is spontaneous and complete. P. superciliosus (and other Palystes spiders) are also commonly seen paralysed, being dragged by a large wasp called a Pompilid wasp. Sometimes the wasp will not be present. Pompilid wasps only hunt spiders, which they paralyse by stinging them. They then drag the spider back to their nest where they lay an egg on the spider, then seal the spider and the egg in. When the egg hatches, the larva eats the paralysed spider, keeping the spider alive as long as possible by eating peripheral flesh first, and saving the vital organs till last. By doing this, the spider stays fresh long enough for the wasp larva to mature and pupate. The Pompilid wasp species Tachypompilus ignitus is at least largely a specialist hunter of mature Palystes females. ==Gallery== File:Palystes superciliosus, Pretoria, d.jpgFemale P. superciliosus File:Palystes natalius01.jpgFemale P. superciliosus File:Palystes_natalius00.jpgUnderside of female P. superciliosus File:Sparassidae Palystes superciliosus Male Ventral Aspect 0110s.jpgUnderside of male P. superciliosus ==References * Palystes (rain spiders, lizard-eating spiders) on Iziko Museums' Biodivesity Explorer Category:Spiders of South Africa Category:Sparassidae Category:Spiders described in 1875 ","title":"Palystes superciliosus"},{"id":"35290831","text":"Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan were the defending champions, but this year they decided not to participate.

The show was hosted by Tony Flanders, associate editor of Sky & Telescope magazine. Each episode of the program was released in one, three, and five-minute formats; and, the show's content and format were similar to that of another weekly astronomy program called Star Gazers. SkyWeek was carried by many PBS affiliates. == Content == SkyWeek was an educational program that described celestial events for the upcoming week. The show was aimed primarily at the general public and required no prior knowledge of astronomy. However, it also contained information that was likely to be interesting to experienced amateur astronomers. It depicted celestial objects in the night sky that could be seen without special equipment such as telescopes. Sky and Telescope's associate editor, Tony Flanders hosted the show, which was available in one-, three- and five-minute versions. == Production == SkyWeek was produced by New Track Media, which publishes Sky & Telescope magazine. The show was distributed to PBS stations through American Public Television. Images from the Hubble Space Telescope and many other professional and amateur sources were used in the production of the show. On April 16, 2014, Tony Flanders announced that the episode covering the week of April 28 to May 4, 2014 would be the last for the series. Flanders reported that the series was being discontinued because of insufficient money from sponsors required to cover the show's costs. == Episodes == Episodes were titled by the week of the events they describe. The production code used was of the form YYMMDD (2 digit year, 2 digit month, 2 digit day) for the date the episode was best suited to be broadcast.

In the autumn 1001 AD,\\"For The Next Millennium\\" after werewolves killed her youngest son, Henrik, the powerful witch Esther performed a powerful ritual in order to protect her five remaining children—Finn, Elijah, Niklaus, Kol, and Rebekah—and her husband, Mikael. The ritual turned them into the first vampires. Following the death of Esther, the family scattered across the world. ==Family history== The family comes from the 10th century Viking- era Europe, from the Kingdom of Norway where a young witch named Esther and her sister Dahlia were captured by Viking raiders. They were the only survivors and were kept alive so Dahlia could aid them by using her witchcraft. Esther was allowed to live freely, given she was in love with one of the Vikings, Mikael. Believing herself to be in love, she turned her back on her magical heritage to marry Mikael, a wealthy landowner, and powerful Viking warrior. She and her sister Dahlia, who since childhood had been her best friend, had sworn an oath to protect each other always and forever. Dahlia was distraught that Esther would rather lay with their captors than escape with her, as she lived like a slave. A year later Esther discovers she is barren, and her desire for children ended in failure. Desperate, Esther turned for help to her sister. Dahlia performed the ritual at a high price, and Esther became fertile. She gave birth to a daughter named Freya, who was quickly followed by a boy named Finn. By the time they left the Old World for the New World, Esther was pregnant with their third child, a boy named Elijah. Mikael was a good husband and a doting father, who adored his children but especially loved his daughter Freya. However, during Esther's third pregnancy and while Mikael was away, Dahlia came to collect her price; the first child of the first generation, just as Esther had promised. She had also promised that she would give up every first child for every generation to come. Dahlia took Freya, and Esther lied to Mikael, telling him their daughter died of the plague and that she burned the body to stop its spread. Not wanting to lose any other children to Dahlia, Esther convinced her husband Mikael, along with Finn, unborn Elijah, and Esther's friend and mentor Ayana, to leave Europe for the Americas, where several Viking colonies already existed. There, they settled in a village on the location of the future town of Mystic Falls in Virginia. Their neighbors were powerful werewolf warriors, and they quickly became a part of society. Mikael became a fierce warrior who helped the werewolves in battle while Ayana became the village healer and taught Esther how to use her magic. Esther quickly became a very powerful witch, even considered by some as being the most powerful of her time. However, the loss of Freya had badly hurt Mikael, and he grew distant from his wife. Eventually, Esther took a liking to the young werewolf leader of the village, Ansel. The two begun an affair, as Mikael still neglected Esther. Esther eventually became pregnant with Ansel's child; and, realizing what Mikael would do to them if he ever found out, she returned to her husband. When she gave birth to a third boy, Niklaus, it renewed his hope for a family. Three more children would be born to Mikael and Esther; two sons, Kol and Henrik, and a daughter, Rebekah. However, Mikael had become harsher as a result of Freya's loss. While he loved his children he wanted them to be fierce warriors, and his children came to fear him. To prevent Mikael from finding out her wedlock son's nature, Esther gave Klaus a cursed pendant, which weakened him and prevented him from triggering his curse. This led him to be viewed badly by Mikael, and he suffered the brunt of his violence. Esther also forbade Ansel from seeing their son; but the werewolf remained close, knowing that Klaus would one day trigger his curse and need him. Despite Mikael's contempt for Klaus, the family was a close one. When Klaus was abused Esther taught him to hum a song, sung by the starlings she'd brought to the new world long ago, the song that her sister Dahlia and she used to hum. However, the family's happiness came to an end when Klaus and Henrik, fascinated by the werewolves, sneaked out of the caves to see them turn on the full moon, which was forbidden by their village's laws. Henrik was killed by the turned wolves. Desperate to protect their remaining children but refusing to run again, Mikael and Esther planned to use magic to prevent them from being hurt. Mikael had Esther turn him and their children into beings faster and stronger than werewolves, with their own fangs to attack, and heightened senses, and unable to be truly killed. Esther, upon her husband's request, called on the power of the sun for life, and the ancient white oak tree for immortality to make her children stronger and immortal while also using the magically spelled blood of a doppelganger to allow them to be reborn as a powerful new species. Mikael and his five remaining children turned while Esther remained a witch. However, for every new strength, a weakness plagued them, the sun that granted life would burn them and keep them inside until dark, vervain that grew on the white oak tree could burn them and prevent mind compulsion, a dagger dipped in white oak ash can keep them in an induced coma type state until the dagger is removed from their heart (daggers can only be used by mortals or Original vampires, other vampires and werewolves that try to dagger an Original will have their own life claimed), while neighbors who had once invited them into their homes could now keep them out unless they are invited, and wood from the white oak tree is the one thing that can take their immortal lives away, by killing them. The worst of the weaknesses was the terrible hunger for blood (like the thing that had made them vampires, it was the thing they craved above all else). They had become the first of the vampire. In their hunger, they massacred half of their village. When Klaus made his first human kill, he triggered his werewolf curse, revealing his mother's infidelity. In his rage, Mikael slaughtered half the village before killing Ansel himself. He then forced his wife to suppress Klaus's werewolf side by using the blood of the doppelganger. Furious at his mother's betrayal, Klaus killed her and blamed his step-father for her death. Mikael fled from their village in his rage, followed by Finn and Kol. After burying their mother, Elijah, Klaus and Rebekah also left their hometown. Despite originating in the 10th century pre- Christianized Norway, most members of the family (all but Freya, Finn, Kol, and Henrik) carry non-Scandinavian names. The rest, apart from Niklaus, carry biblical Hebrew names: Mikael, Esther, Elijah, and Rebekah. The name Mikaelson, or any variants, would likely be anachronistic in 10th century Norway. ==Members of the Mikaelson family== Mikael Mikael is the patriarch of the Mikaelson family. He was portrayed by Sebastian Roché. Mikael was searching for Klaus and the rest of his family for a thousand years. He desired to kill Klaus, in order to get revenge for the murder of his wife and him being framed for it. He always had a bad relationship with Klaus, but caring enough to save him by turning him into a vampire but otherwise being hard on him when he was growing up. Unlike the rest of children who fell inline, Klaus was the black sheep of the family and acted differently, this was because he was the product of an affair Klaus' mother had with a werewolf. As such, Mikael was condescending, cold and abusive towards Klaus for no apparent reason, though Mikael tried to justify this by claiming he was trying to toughen Klaus up. This treatment contributed greatly to Klaus' narcissism, hunger for power, paranoia and psychosis. Mikael was imprisoned in a coffin by Bonnie Bennett's mother Abby, when he came to Mystic Falls looking for Elena Gilbert when she was a small child. He wanted to kill the Petrova doppelgänger in order to prevent Klaus from breaking the curse and creating a hybrid army. Katherine awoke him in order to get information on how to kill Klaus. Klaus eventually killed Mikael using the white oak stake after being saved by Stefan Salvatore. When the Original Vampires throw a ball in order to introduce themselves to the Mystic Falls community, they use the last name \\"Mikaelson\\", as a tribute to the patriarch. Ironically, Klaus also refers to himself as Mikaelson, despite his deep resentment of Mikael. Mikael's ghost appears in New Orleans and convinces Davina to resurrect him, which is successful but found himself bound to Davina via a mystical bracelet or at least until Kol Mikaelson released him while Davina was knocked out. Mikael is the oldest of the Original Family and considered the strongest and most powerful vampire in existence, easily able to overpower Elijah. Even Klaus after breaking the curse that prevented him from becoming an Original Vampire Werewolf Hybrid couldn't defeat Mikael, even with him weakened by werewolf bites, in a fight without blindsiding him with Papa Tunde's Blade and outright got himself overpowered and pinned down by Mikael just before he managed to catch him off- guard. However, Klaus gains the upper hand in the second fight with Mikael as he was further weakened by the dagger and haven't yet recovered from his werewolf bite wounds, with Klaus only to be thwarted in an attempt to save Camille. Klaus kills Mikael a second time in a surprise attempt to use his Viking ashes for a spell to defeat his Aunt Dahlia. Esther Esther is the matriarch of the Mikaelson family. She is portrayed by actress Alice Evans in The Vampire Diaries and in The Originals. While possessing Cassie's body, she was played by Natalie Dreyfuss. She was played by Sonja Sohn while possessing Lenore's body. She was stuck in Lenore's body as a vampire. She was not a vampire, but was a powerful witch. She was the apprentice of a very powerful Bennett witch, Ayanna, during her first years in the New World. Esther was responsible for turning her family into vampires. She did so by summoning life from the sun and immortality from a white oak tree, then making them drink the blood of Tatia, one of Amara's doppelgängers, before having Mikael kill them. She was referred to as \\"The Original Witch\\", though she was not the first witch in the world. This was a reference to the fact that she was the witch who was a part of the Original Family. Esther was murdered by Klaus in the early 11th century, because she used her powers, and those of some other fellow witches, to suppress his werewolf abilities and bind them to the moonstone through the use of a curse, and for making him the target of Mikael's hatred through her affair. Esther comes back to life in the 21st century, when she was awakened by Bonnie and Abby Bennett. Esther tries to kill all of her vampire children, whom she now believes to be abominations after seeing the violence that they embody. She obtains the help of her son Finn, who becomes willing to be sacrificed in order to end the pain that his siblings bring to the world. Esther also seeks the help of Bonnie Bennett and her mother Abby (descendants of the powerful ancient witch Ayanna) by channeling them and their bloodline, in order to gain more power to perform the spell that will kill her children. However, Esther's son Elijah finds out about the plan, and teams up with his siblings to force the Salvatore brothers to prevent his mother from killing the family by kidnapping Elena and threatening to kill her if the Salvatores do not stop Esther's endeavors. Damon Salvatore ends up turning Bonnie's mother into a vampire, which ends her witch abilities and thus destroys the spell. Esther then flees from Mystic Falls to avoid her family. In the season three episode, \\"Heart of Darkness\\", Esther returns to Mystic Falls. She tells Rebekah that she was dying, and wanted to see her daughter one last time; however, she had ulterior motives for returning. She grabs Rebekah's hands, and performs a spell in order to switch bodies with Rebekah, using her as a cover for safety. Esther was desperate to stay safe from Klaus and her other Original Vampire children who want her dead after learning of her plans to kill them all and ending the vampire race. After she returns to her own body, she was killed by Alaric Saltzman's normal self, but not before she successfully performs the ritual on his dark side, and her body was put back into its coffin by Klaus. Esther's remains are consecrated in New Orleans and as a result, she becomes a New Orleans witch, a witch that has or can use the collective power of all the dead New Orleans witches. She eventually becomes the leader of the Ancestors, the spirits of the dead witches who give their power to the living witches. Freya Mikaelson She is portrayed by an American-Canadian actress Riley Voelkel. Mikael and Esther's firstborn child was a daughter. It was originally believed that she died in Europe at a very young age as the result of a plague that had struck their homeland. In reality, Esther's sister Dahlia took the child (and all firstborns from Esther's bloodline) as the price for the magic used to allow Esther to bear children. Esther lies to Mikael, and Freya's supposed death is what caused Mikael and Esther to move to a village in a \\"mystical land\\" far away in the New World, which was later called Mystic Falls. Dahlia took Freya and taught her many of her secrets and, over the years, she became a very powerful witch. Eventually, Dahlia cast a spell on both of them which would provide them with \\"the next best thing\\" to immortality: they would slumber for one hundred years before waking for a year of aging. Eventually, Freya escaped from Dahlia, later telling her brothers, Klaus and Elijah, that it hadn't been easy and that she had lost something in the process. Freya hid from Dahlia's wrath and, eventually, ended up in New Orleans where she wanted to meet her family. Invited to a party thrown by her brothers and her sister as her brother Kol's date, she witnessed Klaus daggering Kol. As his date, she was imprisoned in a cottage which had become an asylum for mad witches since Klaus had a spell placed on it which prevented witches from leaving. Once inside the asylum, Freya returned to her slumber, remaining as such for a hundred years. As her slumber came to an end, Freya discovered that her sister, Rebekah, had been imprisoned in the asylum when her spirit was placed in a witch body by a vengeful Kol. Pretending to be another inmate, she finally met her sister properly, admiring her bravery when she stood up to the Kindred witches who ran the asylum. Later, when Rebekah planned to draw on Freya (not knowing she was her sister) to break the spell on the asylum, the Kindred tried to stop her but Freya arrived and easily dispatched the Kindred with her magic before breaking the spell that contained the witches. Revealing her true identity to Rebekah, she told her that she would soon come to see their brothers. The first of them she met was her brother Finn, whom she had been close to as a child. Revealing what had happened to her after the kidnapping, Freya also learned that her younger brother, Klaus, had fathered a daughter, something that would draw Dahlia once she found out. Helping Finn to kill Hope, she cast a spell to protect her brother for his upcoming confrontation with Elijah, who was protecting Hope. She later brought Finn back thanks to her spell when he was killed by Elijah. She also told him that, once Hope started doing magic, Dahlia would sense it and come for what was hers. Sometime afterwards, once Finn was strong enough, Freya asked him to take her to Mikael, their father, who Finn had been using as a sacrificial power source in his battle with their brothers. Although Mikael was sceptical at first, he eventually recognized his long-lost daughter, and father and daughter happily reunited. Telling Mikael about the truth behind her disappearance and the threat posed by Dahlia, Freya then met with her brothers Klaus and Elijah, who had confronted Finn in the City of the Dead. Removing Finn's spirit from his host and placing him in her pendant, Freya told her brothers that Hope had nothing to fear from her or from Finn now that he was neutralized. She then told them that they needed to ally if they wanted to stop Dahlia, who was far more powerful than any witch they had ever come across. Although Klaus refused her help, especially when he learned of her alliance with Mikael, Elijah was willing to hear her out and even ally with her but he told her that he did not trust her. Freya hoped that she would be able to one day win her younger brother's trust. Freya is one of the most powerful witches to ever walk the earth, along with Dahlia, her niece Hope and her mother Esther. However, Hope's power seems even greater than Freya's and Esther's, as she is capable of accomplishing feats even Esther and Freya could not. Even Rebekah, whose knowledge of magic was quite limited, knew that Freya was far more powerful than any other witch she had encountered. Freya knew and mastered a vast number of spells and could accomplish them at a greater degree than other witches; namely, she could locate someone despite them being protected by a cloaking spell. She could also use her magic in a fight, something that not even a Harvest witch like Davina can do. Finn Mikaelson He is portrayed by a British actor Casper Zafer and was played by American actor Yusuf Gatewood while possessing Vincent Griffith's body. Finn is Mikael and Esther's second born child and was the oldest living Mikaelson family member (he was also the only person to know the truth of Freya's \\"death,\\" as he was there), until his elder sister Freya woke up. He is shown to be even more noble and moral than Elijah, but is more distant to his siblings since he views them as monsters. Finn once had a loving relationship with his siblings, but that changed after they became vampires, and after seeing how they acted he emotionally distanced himself. He still cared about them enough that he stayed with them but held a judgemental attitude towards them, especially Niklaus, whose relationship with Finn became hostile. This made Klaus decide to leave the white oak ash dagger in Finn after The Brotherhood of the Five attacked them. However 900 years later, after Elijah undaggered him, he conspired with Esther to link all the remaining Original Vampires so they could all be destroyed. Finn was responsible for turning the 900-year-old vampire, Sage, with whom he is in love. Sage and Finn reunite shortly before his death. He is killed in The Vampire Diaries third-season episode \\"The Murder of One\\" by Stefan, Elena and Matt, who think that it will kill all of the Originals due to their \\"linked\\" status. However, Klaus manages to force Bonnie into unlinking the siblings moments before Finn is killed. It is revealed through Finn's death that when an Original dies, all vampires of his or her bloodline die as well. As was revealed in the second season of The Originals, Finn returns along with his mother Esther and brother Kol in another body of a male witch named Vincent. Elijah Mikaelson He is portrayed by New Zealand actor Daniel Gillies Elijah is the third born child to Esther and Mikael. Elijah first appears in \\"Rose\\", the eighth episode of the second season of The Vampire Diaries. He is brought into the circle by two vampires named Rose and Trevor. They make a deal to be allowed immunity from Elijah and the Originals if they hand over Elena Gilbert, the new Petrova doppelgänger. It is later revealed that Rose and Trevor were the vampires who failed to keep Katerina Petrova (Katherine Pierce) alive for Klaus to sacrifice in the ritual required to become a vampire/werewolf Hybrid. They were subsequently hunted by Klaus and Elijah for centuries. Elijah had feelings for Katerina in 1492 (perhaps due to her resemblance to Tatia, a former doppelgänger he was in love with), and tried to save her from Klaus; however, she did not trust Elijah and chose to flee. Later, he would punish her for her betrayal by compelling her to stay in a tomb until he said otherwise. Elena is rescued by the Salvatore brothers not long after Elijah kills Trevor, who had betrayed Elijah in the past by helping Katerina escape. The Salvatores attack Elijah and succeed in staking him; however, he comes back to life at the end of the episode because he is an Original Vampire who can not be killed by any wooden stake. Only wood from the ancient white oak, which his family burned when they became vampires, can kill Originals. Elijah then works with a witch to locate Elena. The witch is able to locate her, so he goes to Mystic Falls to confront her, where he ends up saving her from a group of vampires who also wanted to take Elena. It is revealed that those vampires wanted to hand her over to Klaus. When Elijah discovers this, he makes peace with Elena and her friends, because he wants to use Elena as bait to draw out Klaus and kill him. He thus makes a deal with Elena that if she helps him kill Klaus, he will leave her family and her friends alone and keep them safe. However, he intends for Elena to be successfully sacrificed, as once Klaus breaks the curse and starts transforming, he will be left vulnerable enough to be killed. During a series of events, Elijah is temporarily \\"killed\\" when Elena stabs him with a mystical dagger that can kill an Original when dipped in ash from the white oak. When Klaus comes to town, Elena un-daggers Elijah because she needs his help, and he then reveals to her his family's history, and the fact that Klaus killed the rest of his siblings. Elijah thus at first tries to help Elena and her friends kill Klaus, but ends up saving him instead in the Season 2 finale episode, because Klaus promises to take Elijah to their family (Elijah had assumed Klaus had hidden their \\"dead\\" bodies deep in the ocean) if Elijah spares him. In season two's finale however, it is revealed that Klaus double-crossed Elijah once again, and daggered him to keep him close to him, like the rest of his daggered siblings. Damon undaggers Elijah later in season 3 to help him find a way to kill Klaus. When Elijah awakes, he undaggers the rest of his siblings who were located in similar coffins in the same room. They begin to plot their revenge against Klaus; however, before they can make their move, their mother Esther, thought to be dead, reappears and convinces the siblings to be a family again [which later turns out to be a front for her true motives; she wants to link her children's lives together and kill one of them to kill the rest, rendering vampires extinct]. After Elijah foils his mother's plans to kill him and his siblings, he leaves Mystic Falls a tortured soul, ashamed of his own barbaric actions and those of his family's. He is shown to be one of the most sophisticated and peaceful of the Original siblings, alongside his older brother Finn. He is the most compromising regarding Elena and her friends. Elijah and Elena develop a sort of understanding, and Elena comes to be fond of Elijah's company. She thus feels especially betrayed when earlier Elijah threatened to allow Rebekah to kill Elena if the Salvatore brothers are not able to stop Esther Mikaelson from killing the Original Family. However, in the 18th episode of season 3, Elena professes that she hopes that her vampire friends are descended from Elijah's bloodline, so that he can be spared. Elijah returns to town in the season three finale episode, \\"The Departed\\", in order to make a deal with Elena and her friends. Elijah proposes that he be allowed to take Klaus's desiccated (by witch Bonnie and help from the Salvatores and Tyler Lockwood) body with him and his siblings and leave town, and in exchange, he would make sure that Klaus would not be resurrected within Elena's lifetime or even that of her children, stating: \\"perhaps that will teach him some manners\\". However, Klaus is staked, and Elijah and Rebekah believe him to be dead, even though Klaus actually possessed Tyler Lockwood's body and lives on. In season four, Elijah reappears as Katherine's lover, and is making a deal with Katherine for her to be granted her freedom from Klaus in exchange for the cure for immortality, which Klaus wants to give to Silas, the world's first and most dangerous immortal being, to avoid Silas' psychic torture. Elijah refuses Klaus the cure for Rebekah to take before Silas re- claims it, denying Katherine's freedom. Elijah breaks up with Katherine when he learns Klaus has fathered a child and returns to New Orleans to keep Klaus' unborn baby safe and help his brother. He follows his brother Klaus to New Orleans and finds out that Hayley is pregnant with Klaus' child. He begins to have feelings for Hayley and throughout 'The Originals' the two make their feelings for each other clear. When Esther returns, she reveals the truth about how Elaijah's first love, Tatia, was killed, proving it was in fact himself who had fed on her when they had newly been vampires. During one of Finn's spells Elaijah is trapped in a room with animal heads which represent each brother of the family. To escape, Elijah discovers you must ruin the representation of each other, thus causing him to share with Klaus that he killed Tatia. When Klaus proves he is capable of forgiveness the spell is broken and they are free. Niklaus \\"Klaus\\" Mikaelson He is portrayed by British actor Joseph Morgan. Klaus is the middle child out of all his half- siblings. Klaus is the Original Hybrid. He is a werewolf-vampire hybrid being werewolf by birth because Mikael is not his biological father. Klaus was conceived through Esther's infidelity with a werewolf chief over at a time where her marriage with Mikael was struggling. The birth of Klaus brought back hope to Mikael, and Klaus was followed by Kol, Rebekah, and Henrik. Klaus first appears in The Vampire Diaries season 2 episode 17 titled \\"Know Thy Enemy\\" possessing Alaric's body. Klaus first appears in his own body on The Vampire Diaries in season 2 episode 19 titled \\"Klaus\\". He is mainly the head of the family when it comes to decisions and plans. In The Vampire Diaries, Klaus is introduced as an antagonist for seasons 2-5. Klaus repeatedly tries to kill the Salvatore brothers, turns Tyler into a werewolf-vampire hybrid, uses Elena as a human blood bag, constantly puts Caroline Forbes in danger (then saves her), kills Elena's aunt in a ceremony to regain his werewolf side, etc. Throughout his duration on TVD, he forms a soft spot for Caroline. He repeatedly put her in dangerous circumstances almost killing her a few times, but always saves her at the last minute. Once Klaus removed the spell suppressing his werewolf side, he is unable to make hybrids because Elena is still alive. Tyler becomes a test subject for Klaus, becoming his first successful hybrid. Klaus kills the rest of his hybrids after Tyler turns them against him. In TVD's 100th episode, he and his sister return to Mystic Falls, only for Klaus to find Caroline in the woods looking for Matt. He and Caroline hook up, then he leaves Mystic Falls to return to New Orleans. In The Vampire Diaries' spin-off, The Originals, Klaus and his siblings are the centers of the show. Along for the ride, is a pregnant werewolf named Hayley Marshall. Back on TVD, Hayley came through town to help Tyler free the hybrids of their sire bond to Klaus. This leads to Hayley and Klaus hooking up, then parting ways. When Klaus moves to New Orleans, he finds out that his werewolf side allowed him to impregnate Hayley. Elijah and Rebekah join Klaus in New Orleans to help keep Hayley and the baby safe. Hayley is then officially welcomed into the Original family. In season 2 of The Originals, Klaus faces challenges with keeping his daughter safe from his maternal aunt, his mother, and Finn. Season 3 brings the danger of a prophecy predicting the downfall of him and his siblings. Klaus is reunited with old friends, who cause problems, current friends who betray the Mikaelsons, and a Salvator brother in town while he is on the run from a huntress. Klaus' sire bond is broken, causing his enemies to come after him. In season 4, we skip to 5 years in the future. Hayley has been living in hiding with hers and Klaus' daughter, Hope. The Mikaelsons siblings are saved, and Klaus meets his daughter, not as an infant. Hope becomes possessed by a powerful immortal with a spirit called the Hallow, so they split the Hallow amongst the four remaining Original siblings. This meant that Kol, Rebekah, Elijah, and Klaus can no longer see Hope let alone be in the same city. In season 5, it's now been roughly 7 years, and the old Salvatore home in Mystic Falls, VA that belonged to Stefan and Damon, is now a supernatural school called The Salvatore Boarding School for the Young and Gifted where Hope is attending. Hope is 15 and enrolled in school with the last name Marshall instead of Mikaelson with Caroline, Alaric, an old friend of Alaric's who is also a teacher at the school , Dorian Williams, and a boy from Hope and Hayley's pack named Henry, being the only people in the school to know her real identity. Caroline goes to see Klaus. Klaus returns to New Orleans but not in time to save Hayley from vampire purists. Hayley dies from the purists with help from Elijah who has no memory of his past life. The immortal witch spirit, the Hallow, comes back into play trying to possess Hope again. As a last resort, Klaus takes on the dark magic completely, says his goodbyes to Caroline, friends, and family, then he and Elijah kill themselves to eradicate the spirit forever, saving Hope. Kol Mikaelson He is portrayed by Australian actor Nathaniel Buzolic and was played by British actor Daniel Sharman while possessing Kaleb's body. Kol is the youngest surviving son of the Original Family, since the death of his younger brother Henrik and the second youngest child still living, being older than Rebekah. He tries to kill Matt Donovan for entertainment during the Originals' family ball, but is stopped by Damon Salvatore. In the season three episode, \\"Heart of Darkness\\", Kol appears in Denver, Colorado, where Elena and Damon had sent Jeremy, to get him away from Mystic Falls and protect his life. He threatens to hurt Jeremy, in order to prevent Elena and Damon from trying to find out the history of Damon's blood line; (if they managed to do so, they might find out that Elena's friends are not descended from Kol, which would allow them to kill him—see \\"Mythology\\" section). Damon drives a baseball bat through Kol's body in order to debilitate him so that he, Elena, and Jeremy can escape. Kol later appears at the house of Mary Porter, the vampire who sired Rose. Kol kills Mary, so that she is not able to tell Elena and Damon about the history of her bloodline, which could lead them to find out which Original vampire Damon, Stefan, Caroline and Abby Bennett are descended from; Mary sired Rose, Katherine Pierce forced Rose to sire her, and Katherine later sired Damon and Stefan. In season four, Kol returns to aid Rebekah in finding the rumored \\"cure\\" for vampirism. He tortures Professor Shane, who supposedly knows how to get the cure. When Kol realizes that Shane plans to release Silas, the first and most dangerous immortal being of all time, Kol stabs Shane through the torso with a wooden object, killing him. However, Bonnie is able to save Shane's life through an \\"expression\\", or dark magic spell. Kol compels Damon to kill Jeremy so that they cannot find Silas, but Stefan locks Damon away so that he cannot. Elena and Jeremy decide to try and kill Kol because he is trying to stop them from getting the cure. Since Jeremy needs to kill vampires to complete the map to the cure, they conclude that if they kill Kol, which also kills his whole line of vampires, the map will be complete. Elena lures Kol into the house and waits for Jeremy to bring Bonnie, but he does not make it in time. Elena and Jeremy are talking later when Kol appears, storms into the house and tries to cut off Jeremy's hunting arm. Elena corners him and showers him in water mixed with vervain. Jeremy stabs Kol with the white oak stake and he dies. Meanwhile, Klaus is watching furiously in the doorway, unable to help his brother because he has not been invited in. He vows to avenge his brother's death, swearing to kill Jeremy, Elena and anyone else involved. Kol returned in the season four episode \\"The Walking Dead\\", along with several deceased characters as ghosts, longing for revenge against their killers and the residents of Mystic Falls. He clashes once more Matt Donovan, wounding him by throwing a glass bottle at his shoulder and taunting his sister, angered at her brief grieving period, before proceeding to attack Elena, grieving for her brother at his grave. His neck is snapped by Stefan before he managed to kill Elena, however appears in the next episode, \\"Graduation\\", threatening Bonnie into completely destroying the veil so he could return to life. Bonnie plays along with his plan, however deceives him by luring him into a trap, so he can't cause any more harm until the veil is returned. Kol later appears to Matt Donovan while Matt is temporarily trapped on the Other Side. After Matt witnesses his sister Vicky being sucked into oblivion, Kol reveals that the Other Side is unraveling, slowly taking one spirit after the other. Soon, every spirit of the supernatural kind will be gone. Kol begs Matt for his help, before he, too, will be swept away. However, upon awaking, Matt doesn't remember. Soon, the Other Side completely disintegrates, and Kol's fate is left unknown. Some time later in season 2 of The Originals, a young man named Kaleb appears in New Orleans, flirting with the young but powerful witch Davina Claire. He later meets up with Cassie and Vincent, two witches whose bodies have been taken over by Esther and Finn. It's revealed that Kaleb is actually Kol, having taken possession of a body as well. Kol continues his relationship with Davina Claire, originally because his mother told him to but develops feelings for her. He chooses to side with Davina over his mother Esther who he helps stop along with his siblings. However, this leads to his brother Finn casting a spell on him which eventually kills him, leaving Davina heartbroken. In season 3 Davina works to resurrect Kol which she succeeds in doing by aligning herself with the Strix to get the power she needed. Kol is later resurrected by Davina through the energy that was used in un-siring Klaus. Rebekah Mikaelson Rebekah is currently the youngest member of the original family since Henrik died over a thousand years ago. She is portrayed by Australian actress Claire Holt and was played by British actress Maisie Richardson-Sellers while possessing Eva Sinclair's body. She and her living siblings, Finn, Elijah, Klaus and Kol were turned into vampires by their parents, Esther and Mikael Mikaelson. They made them drink the blood of Tatia, one of Amara's doppelgängers, before having Mikael kill them. Esther, their mother who is an original witch, performed a spell using white oak ash for eternal life. When they woke, their father forced them to drink human blood. With the intention of turning them into vampires was so that they could survive in their village and to be stronger, faster and even more vigilant than the werewolves, who killed their youngest brother. However, the great hunger and lust for blood was a bad effect that their parents didn't plan on. Vervain, a plant by the white oak tree, burned them as did sunlight, which caused them to be forced to wear daylight rings or necklaces. The only thing that can really kill an Original is a stake made of the actual white oak tree used to turn them, while a dagger dipped in the ash of the white oak can place them in a deathlike trance until the dagger is pulled out. Rebekah shares a deep bond with her brother Klaus, and was the only family member that remained loyal to him throughout his vicious behavior. Klaus thus kept her by his side, while he kept the rest of his family daggered and stored in coffins for hundreds of years. She had a romantic interest in Stefan Salvatore during their encounters in the early 1920s. During that time period, Klaus and Rebekah are once again forced to go on the run after the arrival of their vengeful father Mikael. Consequently, Rebekah professes an interest to stop running and desires to live a stable life with Stefan by her side. Klaus forces her to choose between himself and Stefan. She chooses the latter, leading Klaus to dagger her. He brings her back to life shortly thereafter, in order to obtain her necklace, which was originally Esther's. The same necklace is gifted to Elena by Stefan during the series first season. Rebekah and Klaus thus head to Mystic Falls. Rebekah develops a deep hatred and envy of Elena, and continually tries to hurt, kill, and emotionally distress her, until her brother makes her stop. Later on, Rebekah tries to be Elena's friend and helps with her and her friends' plan to kill Klaus once she found out he killed her mother, but is betrayed, and daggered by Elena, to simplify the Salvatore's plan to killing Klaus. In season three, Klaus makes Elena reveal Rebekah's location, and takes her body with him. She is eventually un-daggered by Elijah. During her time in Mystic Falls, Rebekah enrolls at the local high school, much to the disgust of Elena and her friends. There, she at first makes romantic advances towards Tyler Lockwood, Caroline Forbes' boyfriend. She later develops a fondness for Matt Donovan, and invites him to her family's ball. Rebekah is shown to be lonely and insecure, though she hides this by being cruel and violent. This is demonstrated quite well through her sexual rendezvouses with Damon Salvatore, an enemy of her family, and the subsequent torture she makes him endure after being betrayed and used by him. Her mother Esther comes back and tells Rebekah and her siblings she wants them to unite and become a family again. However, she really came to kill them all by linking them with a spell that would cause each sibling to die only by killing one of them. Klaus forces Bonnie to undo the spell, but Elena, the Salvatore's and others kill Finn, Rebekah's brother. Rebekah's body is temporarily taken over by her witch mother, Esther, through a spell which Esther performs. She invades Rebekah's body in order to be able to go unnoticed while scheming to kill all of her Original children (who are out for her blood, ever since they discovered that she tried to kill them by a blood-linking spell at the family ball). Esther later leaves Rebekah's body and stakes her; however, Klaus restores Rebekah by removing the stake. Rebekah supposedly leaves Mystic Falls in the season three episode \\"Before Sunset\\", in order to avoid the vampiric version of Alaric Saltzman, who wants to kill her and all other vampires. However, she then returns to Mystic Falls after witnessing the supposed \\"death\\" of her brother. Grief-stricken, she decides to kill Elena, therefore killing Alaric and taking away the last threat to her and her family therefore saving her family. She causes both Elena and Matt Donovan to drive off of the Wickery Bridge and into the lake to drown, and Elena dies, along with Alaric. However, Elena had vampire blood in her system, something Rebekah was unaware of. In season four, Rebekah is yet again daggered by Klaus, after he believes she will be an obstacle in finding The Cure. However, she is then un-daggered by April Young, and sets upon finding it herself. After developing a 'no strings attached' relationship with Stefan, she reveals she wants to be human, feeling miserable as a vampire. In season one of The Originals, after Klaus's child is born she returns to New Orleans and is named the caretaker of Klaus's child. She promises to get a strong witch to protect her and her niece from Esther, who wants to kill the baby. In the second season, Rebekah makes a return. Henrik Mikaelson Henrik was the child of Esther and Mikael. He was killed by werewolves a thousand years ago, before the family had been turned into vampires. He is portrayed by Devon Allowitz in season three. His death created a war between the werewolf clan and his own family, causing his mother to turn the family into vampires, so they could defend themselves against the lycanthropic beasts. Hope Mikaelson Hope is portrayed by Alexandria and Victoria Collins in \\"Rebirth\\", later by toddlers in seasons 2 and 3, by Summer Fontana in season 4, and by Danielle Rose Russell in season 5 and the Hope-centric spin-off series Legacies. Hope Andrea Mikaelson is the daughter of Niklaus \\"Klaus\\" Mikaelson and the former-werewolf Hayley Marshall-Kenner. Hope is the result of a one-night stand between her parents, and after her birth her family agreed to fake her death to protect her from all those who wish her harm. Klaus, after promising to get Hope back one day, gives her to the only person he can trust to protect and raise his daughter: his sister, Rebekah. Hope is returned to her parents later in Season 2. Hope is powerful and, apart from being a vampire-werewolf hybrid, is also a witch of the Mikaelson bloodline which is one of the most powerful witch lineages in the fictional world of The Vampire Diaries. Though she inherited her vampiric trait from her father, an Original, it is unknown whether she’d become an Original or regular vampire upon death (when she activates her vampire side). Her werewolf heritage is that of an alpha, through Hayley, making her royalty among the werewolves as the Princess of the Crescent pack. All of those combined makes her a vampire- werewolf-witch hybrid. Or, a tribrid. She is the only one of her kind. At the end of season 4, Hope is sent to Mystic Falls to study magic at the Salvatore Boarding School, which provides the premise for Legacies. In Legacies, she struggles with anger and sadness after losing her parents. She cannot find peace and wonders if Klaus has found peace. She ends up in a romantic relationship with Landon Kirby. To protect him from his father, Malivore, she throws herself into Malivore Pit at the end of the final episode of the first season. Dahlia She is portrayed by Australian actress Claudia Black. The older sister of Esther, sister-in-law of Mikael, aunt of Freya, Finn, Elijah, Niklaus \\"Klaus\\", Kol, Rebekah and Henrik Mikaelson, maternal great-aunt of Hope Mikaelson, and first-born witch of that generation of their family, Dahlia is one of the most powerful witches in history, far more than that of her sister, already regarded as one of the most powerful. Dahlia was taken, along with Esther from her homeland, which was destroyed by the Vikings who locked her away as a slave to do magic whilst allowing Esther to roam freely. When Ester decides to marry one of their captors instead of escape with her sister and best friend, Dahlia becomes a hate-filled woman. Years later Esther discovers she is infertile and in desperation seeks out her sister. Dahlia agrees to perform a ritual that will give her fertility, if Esther agrees to give her the first-born child of every generation, all of whom, like Dahlia, would possess immense magical power. Esther obliges and Dahlia comments that she would be able to help herself if Esther hadn't given up magic. Years later Dahlia contacts her sister wishing to collect her fee, five-year-old Freya Mikaelson. Esther, upset, begs her sister not to take her daughter, and swears to grow in power until she is more powerful than Dahlia, claiming she did not know the love of a parent to a child when she made the deal. Dahlia commands Esther to tell Mikael that their daughter died from the bubonic plague and her body was burned. Described by Freya as the most powerful witch she has ever seen, Dahlia first gained her enhanced powers by linking her magic to the magic possessed by her then five-year-old niece Freya. Once Freya reached adulthood, Dahlia then cast a spell that allows them both to gain pseudo- immortality by leap-frogging through time; the women were put into a magically-induced sleep for nearly a century, only to awaken for one single year of life and aging with all of the magic they accrued over their hundred- year-long slumber, before they would once again return to their sleep after the year had passed. Dahlia's understanding of magic after so many years of study is extensive enough that she was able to create her own form of connective magic in the 10th century. She also has the ability to sense the magic of other witches, especially those of the first-born children of her and her sister Esther's bloodline, as the first-born witches of their lineage possess devastating amounts of power. According to Freya, Dahlia aims to be truly immortal without having to sleep for centuries, and she will not hesitate to come and claim the first-born Mikaelson witches to achieve this goal, even if it means destroying anyone who stands in her way. ==Mythology and powers== Being the oldest and third most powerful vampires (behind the Original Hybrid and the Beast, Marcel Gerard) the Original Vampires are stronger and faster than all normal vampires, even the most ancient ones and hybrids, though it is implied they do not get stronger with age due to being created at the zenith of vampiric physical prowess. (Alaric was just as strong, if not stronger, than the other Original Vampires despite being a day old. So too was Lucien, strong enough to kill Finn and Marcel who had the ability to overthrow the entire Mikaelson clan which almost killed two of them during the process). It is possible that the spell used to make the Original Vampires, gives them the peak powers of vampirism. Also, werewolves prove little to no challenge for them, though they can be challenging in their wolf form (where they are at their strongest) as a pack of four are capable of overwhelming the Original Vampire (Rebekah) and two human form werewolves with moonrings (which allows them to use the full power of their condition) overpowered Elijah, though he was taken by surprise and briefly passed out from their venom. Original Vampires are somewhat immune to werewolf venom, which is fatal to normal vampires but it still affects Original Vampires, though they only experience weakness and hallucinations. However, the newly created Werewolf venom stored inside The Beast's fangs could kill an Original vampire within hours. Original Vampires have the power to \\"compel\\" or hypnotize ordinary vampires, hybrids because of their vampire side and in addition to humans, though they cannot compel each other.Elijah compels Slater to drive a stake through his heart, \\"Katerina\\" Nothing can kill an Original Vampire, except for a heart-aimed stake made only of the Ancient White oak, the immense power of a very powerful witch (though channeling that much power will also kill the witch) and the Bite of The Beast. If an Original Vampire is stabbed with the White Oak Stake, he or she will die and burn to ashes. Using a silver dagger dipped in the ashes of the white oak tree will cause the Original Vampires to be neutralized as long as the dagger remains within them; however, that type of dagger would not work on Klaus due to his werewolf side, and only a pure white oak stake could kill him. However, Davina and Kol had created a gold dagger with the ability to subdue Klaus. Other stakes temporarily disable Original Vampires, but they recuperate in hours. This was demonstrated when Elijah pulled out the wooden stake that Damon had plunged into his chest when attempting to rescue Elena from Rose and Trevor.Damon is able to temporarily subdue Elijah, \\"Rose\\" When an Original Vampire dies, all of the vampires from his or her bloodline die as well. This is demonstrated when Damon, Stefan, Elena and Matt kill Finn, resulting in the deaths of Sage and Troy, (Finn had sired Sage and Sage had sired Troy, thus creating a blood line). Thus, if all Original Vampires were to be killed, the entire vampire species would be rendered extinct, since all the vampires in the world are descended from the Original Vampires. However, in season 3 of the Originals, Klaus and his sireline are unlinked, meaning that if Klaus were to die, his sireline would continue to live on. It is unknown if any new Vampires that Klaus sired would be linked to him, or if they would also be unlinked, it is also unknown if Klaus' sireline can be relinked to him again. However, it is necessary for the Original Vampire's spirit to cross the veil, in order for his or her bloodline to follow suit. In the season three finale episode \\"The Departed\\", Klaus manages to switch bodies with Tyler Lockwood before being staked and lives on; thus, even though his body supposedly burnt to ashes, none of his bloodline is affected. In season four it was revealed that the spell Esther used to create the Original Vampires is a variation of the spell Qetsiyah, the ancestor of her friend Ayana, used to create the immortality elixir. Klaus, the Original hybrid, was fertile due to his werewolf nature and thus impregnates Hayley, giving him a daughter named Hope. She has only shown witch powers and presumably would be a werewolf if she killed anyone, but her blood can create hybrids sired to her. She has created a new sire line by turning her mother. While initially it was unknown if her death would result in the death of her \\"descendants\\" as with any other Original vampires, Hayley was later described as an \\"unsired vampire\\", because she is not linked to any Original vampire. ==TV series== On January 11, 2013, it was announced that a back-door pilot focused on the Originals, starring Joseph Morgan as Klaus titled The Originals would air April 25 for a potential series pick-up for the 2013–2014 season. This second spin-off attempt is carried out by Julie Plec. There is no involvement by Kevin Williamson. In February 2013, it was announced that Daniella Pineda was cast as the witch Sophie for episode 4x20 of The Vampire Diaries. This episode serves as a backdoor-pilot for the spin- off series, revolving around the Originals and taking place in the French Quarter of New Orleans. She was a regular cast member for first thirteen episodes of the series. On February 11, 2013 it was announced that Leah Pipes was cast as the human Camille. Although there has been talk of a love triangle between Marcel and Klaus with this bartender/college student, there isn't any evidence to support this. However the character was in a small love triangle for couple episodes in the first season. In the third season, she becomes a vampire and later dies after Lucien bites her. She's shown to love Klaus and she brings out the good in him. Pipes makes a special guest appearance in season 4 and 5. ==See also== *List of The Vampire Diaries characters ==References== Category:The Vampire Diaries characters Category:The Originals (TV series) Category:Vampires in television Category:Television about werewolves Category:Fictional families ","title":"Original Vampires (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"35290994","text":"William Wallace Hayward Nash (22 September 1884 – 24 July 1977) was an English cricketer.

Therefore, here culture is understood as a system of symbols or meaningful signs. Because the main sign system is the linguistic system, the field is usually referred to as semiotics of culture and language. Under this field of study symbols are analyzed and categorized in certain class within the hierarchal system. With postmodernity, metanarratives are no longer as pervasive and thus categorizing these symbols in this postmodern age is more difficult and rather critical. The research field was of particular interest for the Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School (USSR). Linguists and semioticians by the Tartu School viewed culture as a hierarchical semiotic system consisting of a set of functions correlated to it, and linguistic codes that are used by social groups to maintain coherence. These codes are viewed as superstructures based on natural language, and here the ability of humans to symbolize is central. The study received a research ground also in Japan where the idea that culture and nature should not be contrasted and contradicted but rather harmonized was developed. == References == * Lotman, Jurij M., and Boris A.

Chapple was close to Burges and was one of the executors of his will.

Chapple also worked with Pullan and William Frame in completing a number of Burges's unfinished works, including Cardiff Castle, and Castell Coch, the fantasy palaces Burges designed for John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute in South Wales. At Castell Coch, Chapple was responsible for much of the furniture, including the elaborate suite in Lady Bute's bedroom. He also completed St Michael's Church, Brighton.

He was brought to Tavistock, Devon, with his brother, William Barry Lord, and educated by an uncle named Luscombe. Lord was apprenticed to Messrs. Edgecombe & Stannes, chemists in Tavistock, and then entered the Royal Veterinary College, London, 4 November 1842; and received his diploma 29 May 1844. He established himself as a veterinary surgeon at Tavistock; but he began to drink, and he suddenly disappeared. Lord is said to have made a whaling voyage and been shipwrecked, and to have been for some years a trapper in Minnesota and the Hudson Bay fur countries. On 19 June 1855, during the Crimean War, he was appointed to the British Army in the East as a veterinary surgeon with local rank, and attached to the artillery of the Turkish forces, with which he served in the Crimea. He received the rank of lieutenant 4 January 1856. In August 1856 he was acting as veterinary surgeon with local rank and senior lieutenant of the Osmanli horse artillery. When British Columbia was formed into a colony, after the gold discoveries on the Fraser River in western Canada in 1858, Lord was appointed naturalist to the commission which was sent out to run a boundary line along the 49th parallel north of latitude, separating the new colony from United States territory. He was for some time resident on Vancouver Island; the collection (mammals, birds, fishes, insects, and other) made by him went to the British Museum (South Kensington). Two claimed new mammals, Fiber osoyooensis and Lagomys minimus (i.e. American pikaOchotona princeps - American pika.), were described by him in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society, 1863. In the same year he delivered lectures in the garb of a trapper on The Canoe, the Rifle, and the Axe, at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly, London; and there he became acquainted with Francis Trevelyan Buckland. At Buckland's suggestion he became a contributor to The Field, and joined the staff of Land and Water on its establishment 1 January 1866. Subsequently Lord was employed by the Viceroy on archæological and scientific researches in Egypt. While there he made observations on snakes and exposed the tricks of the snake-charmers. He brought to London collections of remains from ancient mines and sent them back to Egypt after arranging them. Lord was appointed the first manager of the Brighton Aquarium, which was opened 10 August 1872; four months later he died, in his fifty-fifth year, at his residence, 17 Dorset Gardens, Brighton, 9 December 1872. ==Works== Illustration to At Home in the Wilderness Lord was author of: * The Naturalist in Vancouver Island and British Columbia, London, 1866, 2 vols., at the end of which are lists of his collections in north-west America. * At Home in the Wilderness, by \\"The Wanderer\\", London, 1867, 2nd edit. 1876. * Handbook of Sea-Fishing. Catalogues of collections of lepidoptera and hymenoptera formed by him in Egypt were published in London in 1871. He helped in an enlarged edition of Francis Galton's Art of Travel, was a contributor to The Leisure Hour and other journals, and under the signature \\"The Wanderer\\" contributed papers on sea fisheries and other topics to Land and Water, which for a short time he edited as Buckland's substitute. ==References== ;Attribution * * ==External links== * royalengineers.ca, John Keast Lord: Veterinarian and Naturalist.

Prince Johann of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (17 August 1578 in Sigmaringen - 22 March 1638 in Munich), was the ruling Count of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen from 1606 to 1623. He was elevated to the rank of prince in 1623 and so was Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen from 1623 until his death. == Life == Johann was the eldest surviving son of Count Karl II of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (1547–1606), from his marriage to Euphrosyne (1552–1590), the daughter of Count Friedrich V of Oettingen-Wallerstein. He studied law and political sciences at the Universities of Freiburg and Ingolstadt. On 30 June 1602 in Sigmaringen, Johann married the three years younger Countess Johanna (1581–1634), the daughter of Count Eitel Friedrich IV of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. On 8 April 1606, his father died and Johann inherited the county. Unlike their relatives who ruled the Electorate of Brandenburg, the Sigmaringen branch of the House of Hohenzollern had remained Catholic. However, Sigmaringen was located in the immediate vicinity of the Evangelical Duchy of Württemberg, and thus on a prominent position in the escalating confessional conflict. Johann aligned himself closely to the Duchy of Bavaria, the pioneer of the Catholic League. Johann's son and successor, Meinrad I, was even born in Munich in 1605. The alliance with Duke Maximilian I of Bavarian, who had been a close friend of the later Emperor Ferdinand since his teens, paid divident in 1623, after Bohemia had been subdued by Bavaria and Bavaria had been elevated to an electorate, Johann and his cousin Johann Georg of Hohenzollern-Hechingen were elevated to Princes. In 1634, the Hohenzollern-Haigerloch line died out and its territory fell to Johann. His financial situation allowed Johann to make substantial donations to the churches and monasteries in his territory and to further expand his Sigmaringen Castle. Sigmaringen was affected by the devastation of the Thirty Years' War. In 1632, Sigmaringen Castle was conquered by Sweden. In 1633, it was liberated by imperial troops. However, during the fighting it burned down. Johann fled to Braunau am Inn, together with Duke Maximilian, whom he served as secret councillor. After Johann resigned from Maximilian's service, he received the Lordship of Schwabegg from the Duke. Johann remained in Bavaria and died at the age of 60, in Munich in 1638, four years after his wife had died. Earlier that year, he had been elevated to the rank of Imperial Prince, in other words, he had received a seat in the college of princes in the Imperial Diet. == Issue == From his marriage to Johanna, Johann had the following children: * Meinrad I (1605–1681), Prince of Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen : married in 1635 to Countess Anna Maria Toerring-Seefeld (1613–1682) * Marie (1606–1674), married: *# in 1625 to Count Paul Andreas of Wolkenstein (1595–1635) : to Baron Rudolph Georg of Haßlang (died after 1676) * Euphrosyne Sibylle (1607–1636) : married in 1628 to Count Ernst Benno of Wartenberg (1604–1666) ==Ancestry References == * Gustav Schilling: Geschichte des Hauses Hohenzollern in genealogisch fortlaufenden Biographien aller seiner Regenten von den ältesten bis auf die neuesten Zeiten, nach Urkunden und andern authentischen Quellen, Fleischer, Leipzig, 1843, p. 266 ff, Online * E.

Drama theory is one of the problem structuring methods in operations research. It is based on game theory and adapts the use of games to complex organisational situations, accounting for emotional responses that can provoke irrational reactions and lead the players to redefine the game. In a drama, emotions trigger rationalizations that create changes in the game, and so change follows change until either all conflicts are resolved or action becomes necessary. The game as redefined is then played. Drama theory was devised by professor Nigel Howard in the early 1990s and, since then, has been turned to defense, political, health, industrial relations and commercial applications. Drama theory is an extension of Howard's metagame analysis work developed at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1960s, and presented formally in his book Paradoxes of Rationality, published by MIT Press. Metagame analysis was originally used to advise on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT). == Basics of drama theory == A drama unfolds through episodes in which characters interact. The episode is a period of preplay communication between characters who, after communicating, act as players in a game that is constructed through the dialogue between them. The action that follows the episode is the playing out of this game; it sets up the next episode. Most drama-theoretic terminology is derived from a theatrical model applied to real life interactions; thus, an episode goes through phases of scene-setting, build-up, climax and decision. This is followed by denouement, which is the action that sets up the next episode. The term drama theory and the use of theatrical terminology is justified by the fact that the theory applies to stage plays and fictional plots as well as to politics, war, business, personal and community relations, psychology, history and other kinds of human interaction. It was applied to help with the structuring of The Prisoner's Dilemma, a West End play by David Edgar about the problems of peace-keeping. In the build-up phase of an episode, the characters exchange ideas and opinions in some form or another and try to advocate their preferred position – the game outcome that they are hoping to see realised. The position each character takes may be influenced by others' positions. Each character also presents a fallback or stated intention. This is the action (i.e., individual strategy) a character says it will implement if current positions and stated intentions do not change. Taken together, the stated intentions form what is called a threatened future if they contradict some character's position; if they do not – i.e., if they implement every position – they form what is called an agreement. When it is common knowledge among the characters that positions and stated intentions are seen by their presenters as 'final', the build-up ends and the parties reach a moment of truth. Here they usually face dilemmas arising from the fact that their threats or promises are incredible or inadequate. Different dilemmas are possible depending on whether or not there is an agreement. If there is an agreement (i.e., stated intentions implement every position), the possible dilemmas resemble those found in the prisoner's dilemma game; they arise from characters distrusting each other's declared intention to implement the agreement. If there is no agreement, more dilemmas are possible, resembling those in the game of chicken; they arise from the fact that a character's threat or its determination to stick to its position and reject other positions may be incredible to another character. Drama theory asserts that a character faced with a dilemma feels specific positive or negative emotions that it tries to rationalize by persuading itself and others that the game should be redefined in a way that eliminates the dilemma; for example, a character with an incredible threat makes it credible by becoming angry and finding reasons why it should prefer to carry out the threat; likewise, a character with an incredible promise feels positive emotion toward the other as it looks for reasons why it should prefer to carry its promise. Emotional tension leads to the climax, where characters re-define the moment of truth by finding rationalizations for changing positions, stated intentions, preferences, options or the set of characters. There is some experimental evidence to confirm this assertion of drama theory (see P. Murray-Jones, L. Stubbs and N. Howard, 'Confrontation and Collaboration Analysis: Experimental and Mathematical Results', presented at the 8th International Command & Control Research and Technology Symposium, June, 2003—from whose site it can be downloaded. Six dilemmas (formerly called paradoxes) are defined, and it is proved that if none of them exist then the characters have an agreement that they fully trust each other to carry out. This is the fundamental theorem of drama theory. Until a resolution meeting these conditions is arrived at, the characters are under emotional pressure to rationalize re-definitions of the game that they will play. Re-definitions inspired by new dilemmas then follow each other until eventually, with or without a resolution, characters become players in the game they have defined for themselves. In game-theoretic terms, this is a game with a focal point – i.e., it is a game in which each player has stated its intention to implement a certain strategy. This strategy is its threat (part of the threatened future) if an agreement has not been reached, and its promise (part of the agreement), if an agreement has been reached. At this point, players (since they are playing a game) decide whether to believe each other, and so to predict what others will do in order to decide what to do themselves. == Dilemmas defined in drama theory == The dilemmas that character A may face with respect to another character B at a moment of truth are as follows. * A's cooperation dilemma: B does not believe A would carry out its actual or putative promise to implement B's position * A's trust dilemma: A does not believe B would carry out its actual or putative promise to implement A's position * A's persuasion (also known as \\"deterrence\\") dilemma: B certainly prefers the threatened future to A's position * A's rejection (also known as \\"inducement\\") dilemma: A may prefer B's position to the threatened future * A's threat dilemma: B does not believe A would carry out its threat not to implement B's position * A's positioning dilemma: A prefers B's position to its own, but rejects it (usually because A considers B's position to be unrealistic) == Relationship to game theory == Drama- theorists build and analyze models (called card tables or options boards) that are isomorphic to game models, but unlike game theorists and most other model- builders, do not do so with the aim of finding a 'solution'. Instead, the aim is to find the dilemmas facing characters and so help to predict how they will re-define the model itself – i.e., the game that will be played. Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters. The relation between drama theory and game theory is complementary in nature. Game theory does not explain how the game that is played is arrived at – i.e., how players select a small number of players and strategies from the virtually infinite set they could select, and how they arrive at common knowledge about each other's selections and preferences for the resulting combinations of strategies. Drama theory tries to explain this, and also to explain how the focal point is arrived at for the game with a focal point that is finally played. However, drama theory does not explain how players will act when they finally have to play a particular game with a focal point, even though it has to make assumptions about this. This is what game theory tries to explain and predict. == See also == *Confrontation analysis == References == * N. Howard, 'Confrontation Analysis', CCRP Publications, 1999.

But the Games were eventually boycotted by the Soviet Union, ending any aspirations for Kolchinsky participation. Viktor Igumenov, Soviet National Team Coach, later told that Kolchinsky was rowdy and extremely lazy athlete, zero-discipline hooligan with little or no motivation for sports, but at the same time an remarkably talented wrestler, with springy and flexible body, gifted with a lightweight speed packed in a large, heavyweight frame. ==Retirement and later years== Kolchynsky retired in the early 1980s, and in 1983 moved to Tashkent, Uzbek SSR, where he opened a small sewing shop together with his wife. Later he became involved with Ukrainian organized crime and in 1994 was sentenced to seven years of prison for extortion. He was paroled in 1996 and became a wrestling coach for teenagers. He died of a heart attack in 2002, aged 47.

He studied naval architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and in 1929 joined the firm of boat designer John Alden as a draftsman. While there, Peterson conceived the idea of a \\"character\\" craft, designing a miniature coasting schooner that would have the looks and flavor of the commercial schooner. In 1931 the Boothbay, Maine shipyard of Goudy and Stevens built and launched the first Coaster. In 1933, Peterson left Alden's firm and opened his own business. The first design he completed was the one for this vessel, the Coaster II, which he designed as his personal yacht. Coaster II was built in 1933, again by the shipyard of Goudy and Stevens. Peterson lived aboard the ship until 1935, when he sold her. The yacht was used to race from San Francisco to Hawaii, and was used as a sub-spotter off Long Island during World War II. She also rounded Cape Horn. At some point she was renamed Quissett. Niko Economides purchased Coaster II in 2007 and moved her to Marquette.

This version agrees pretty much with the oral tradition of the Serer people. According to Serer tradition, the king was very ill before his death and ruled for 27 winters (27 years) before his successor - Maad a Sinig Mahecor Joof succeeded to the throne. When the King died, there was a period of mourning and it took a little while to prepare for the Coronation ceremony of Maad a Sinig Mahecor Joof according to Serer custom and tradition.Diouf, « Chronique du royaume du Sine, loc. cit., pp. 732-777.Sarr, Alioune, « Histoire du Sine-Saloum. Introduction, bibliographie et notes par Charles Becker », Bulletin de l'IFAN, tome 46, série B, n° 3-4, 1986-1987, pp. 211-283. Maad Mahecor Joof ascended to the throne in 1924, more precisely, according to some, on 28 January 1924. Regarding the year Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb Joof died, there is consensus that it was in 1923,Klein, Islam and imperialism in Senegal, p. 202. more specifically on 21 December 1923 at Diakhao. Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb Joof should not be confused with his great uncleKumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb's mother Lingeer Njem or Jem is niece of Kumba Ndoffene fa Maak Joof. Her mother is sister of Kumba Ndoffene fa Maak Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof, also known as Coumba Ndoffène I, who reigned from 1853 to August 1871.Klein, Islam and imperialism in Senegal, p. xv. The prefix Famak (or Fa mak) means \\"the elder\\" in the Serer language. Fa Ndeb (also :Fandepp, Fa ndepp or Fandeb) means \\"the young\\" in Serer. These prefixes were later additions (during and after the reigne of Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb) to differentiate the two Kings of Sine who shared the same name and surname.This is a Serer tradition of not merely differentiating their kings with a similar name and surname, but also people from the same family with similar names and surnames (mak = elder, ndep/ndeb = younger). ==Succession== His predecessor Maad a Sinig Mbacke Ndeb Njie died without nominating his Buumi (heir- apparent). At that time Maad Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb was the Thilas (the second in line to the throne). Without a Buumi, Maad Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb was elected by the Great Jaraff and his Noble Council, as King of Sine. On his coronation, he was crowned Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb Joof from the Royal House of Boureh Gnilane Joof.The Serer traditional way of crowning their kings. See Alioune Sarr, \\"Histoire du Sine-Saloum\\", also see : Coronation of Maad a Sinig Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof. His Great Jaraff (equivalent of Prime Minister) was Bandiougour Sène. ==French interference== The succession of Maad Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb was unwelcomed by the French administration in Senegal, in particular by Hippolyte Alsace. The Great Jaraff and his Council of nobles who were in charge of electing the kings from the royal family were informed by Alsace that, he would not endorse their choice. The noble Council objected, and told him they had made their choice, and the people of Sine had appointed Maad Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb as their king. This answer displeased the French administration. The Kingdom of Sine was divided into cantons and Maad Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb was appointed Superior Chief of Eastern Sine and his rival Prince Kumba Jimit was made Superior Chief of Western Sine.Klein, Islam and imperialism in Senegal, p. 195. The interference of the French administration in Sine and their attempt to divide the Sine into cantons were bound to fail. Whilst in theory Maad Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb was a simple Chief, in practice, he was King of Sine. The Serers of Sine had elected him and they were reluctant to submit to the orders of anyone else. The flaws in this system became apparent when the Serer population of Western Sine refused to pay their taxes. When the French administrator Victor Valantin went to Western Sine in March 1899 in order to force the people to pay taxes, the Serers of Western Sine hid their children, their wives and animals, and took up arms. Valantin and his party were forced to make a hasty retreat.Klein, Islam and imperialism in Senegal, pp. 200-203. Relations between the French administration and the Serer nobility of Sine deteriorated further when Charles Lefilliâtre wrote to Prince Leopold Joof, the private secretary of the King, saying that \\"there was no king,\\" and a letter to Maad Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb calling him a \\"simple chief and nothing more.\\" Lefilliâtre later retracted his statements and became the main supporter of Maad Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb within the French administration of Senegal.Klein, Islam and imperialism in Senegal, pp. 201-202. ==Leadership== In 1901, Maad Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb managed to prevent the creation of a Christian mission in Diohine and kept the Church out of Sine.Klein, Islam and imperialism in Senegal, p. 203. When a disgruntled son of Damel-Teigne Lat Dior Ngoneh Latir Jobe (former King of Cayor and Baol) tried to incriminate Amadou Bamba by accusing him of pilling weapons in order to launch a war against the French administration, the French put Amadou Bamba on trial. Although Maad Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb was a devout follower of Serer religion and not a Muslim, he was the only one who came to the defense of Amadou Bamba, and told the French administration to release him at once as the accusations made against him are nothing but lies. Amadou Bamba was released and all the false charges against him were dropped. Maad Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb Joof was an effective leader and his powers were very real despite French directives. When Farba Diouf (son of Maad Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb) - himself a later convert to Islam, was once asked whether his father had ever contemplated converting to Islam. His response was : \\"Never!\\". ==Titles== Apart from being a Maad a Sinig (King of Sine) and previously a Thilas,Klein, Islam and imperialism in Senegal, p. 173. he was also made Officier de la Légion d'Honneur.«Magal du Grand Témoignage du Bour Sine Coumba Ndoffène Diouf Fandëb à Serigne Touba Khadimou Rassoul : 7 June 2009-DIakhao - 13 juillet 2009 Darou Marnane », article of Soleil in Xibar.net ==Legacy== Léopold Sédar Senghor, the poet and first president of Senegal, magnified the king of Sine in his famous poem \\"Joal\\" in 1945. He described in Homeric manner all the nobility that surrounded the King in his ceremonies, and went on to talk about how Kumba Ndoffene Fa Ndeb once tried to trim his royal robes, which he [Senghor] still remembers in adulthood.«Je me rappelle les fastes du Couchant.

Jasper (NA4-aš-pu) is likened to the clear heavens and a rain cloud and represents the lower heavens due to its greenish or bluish hue, the color of the sky. The stone of the middle heaven is described: “The stone whose appearance is red, covered with white and black patches is named (of) luludānītu stone. The stone whose appearance is like lapis-lazuli is named saggilmud-stone,” with its marbled appearance of black, red and white veins representing the upper heavens. The ašgikû-stone, powders of which were used in medical prescriptions to treat pulsating veins in the temples, is described: “the appearance of the stone resembles green obsidian, but [with/without] the striations. As for this stone, ašgikû is its name.” Statues representing šēdu and lamassu figures were made from specific stones to repel the evildoer.abnu CAD a/1, p. 56.

Following Burges's death in 1881, Frame remained in the service of John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute and continued Burges's work at both castles, as well as designing the Grade I listed Pierhead Building in the docks built by Bute's father. Frame also continued to work on Bute's Scottish home, Mount Stuart House, on the Isle of Bute. He undertook the building of the Animal Wall, in the grounds of Cardiff Castle, for which Burges had got no further than drawing the designs. Burges's favourite sculptor, Thomas Nicholls, executed the carvings. During these years he won the Royal Academy's gold medal and the Soane Medallion. Later in his life, Frame also produced a small number of very well regarded grandfather clocks in the village of Larkhall, Scotland that were commissioned by some of the aristocratic class of his time.

A QRISK over 10 (10% risk of CVD event over the next ten years) indicates that primary prevention with lipid lowering therapy (such as statins) should be considered. In the UK, current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend using QRISK (as opposed to the Framingham Risk Score). The algorithm has subsequently been validated by an independent team from the Centre for Statistics in Medicine (University of Oxford) using an external dataset. The results were published in the BMJ and demonstrated that QRISK performed better than Framingham . www.qrisk.org is updated annually to reflect changes in populations, data quality and national guidelines (such as a change in age range over which cardiovascular risk should be assessed). The inclusion of ethnicity and deprivation in the QRISK2 algorithm is designed to help prevent widening health inequalities. The QIntervention website combines QRISK with a similar risk prediction tool (www.qdiabetes.org) to calculate risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. www.qintervention.org also allows clinicians to assess 'what if' scenarios i.e. how risk might change with modification of risk factors such as weight loss, stopping smoking, use of statins and better blood pressure control.

Typically, the pentode was used for the input stage, and the triode as a phase inverter. The tube was used in a number of American guitar amplifiers; the Gibson Guitar Corporation, for instance, used the 7199 in 1961's Falcon for the reverb circuit. Ampeg also used the 7199 extensively. Notable is the Dynaco ST-70 stereo amplifier introduced in 1959 which used a 7199 tube in the driver section of each channel. Over the next decade more than 350,000 of these amplifiers were produced. American 7199 production ended sometime in the 1980s while the Soviet tube company Sovtek produced one until roughly 2007. As a result the tube is becoming increasingly scarce. Another tube of the same type found in far more plentiful supply is the 6U8A, which is electrically identical, but with a different pinout configuration. The 6U8A can be substituted for a 7199 using a readily available adapter, or by making a slight modification to the wiring of its tube socket. ==References== Category:Guitar amplification tubes ","title":"7199"},{"id":"35291358","text":"Maja e Thatë is a mountain peak of the Albanian Alps (Prokletije) in Albania.Military topographic map of Albania (1:25 000): K-34-52-D-a (M. JEZERCES) It is located within Valbonë Valley National Park, roughly northwest of Valbonë and rises more than above the village. The mountain's southern and western lower slopes are relatively rich in beech and pine forests, while the higher slopes consist of very steep dolomite and limestone rock walls, suitable for mountaineering and rock climbing. == Overview == Maja e Thatë has an elevation of and is located northwest of Valbonë village, in the district of Tropojë, Kukës county, in Albania. It lies within the massif of Kolata, in the eastern part of the Albanian Alps (Prokletije) mountain range. Maja e Thatë rises above the village of Valbonë by more than , but being surrounded by higher peaks within its massif and because high-altitude mountain passes connect it with them, Maja e Thatë's topographic prominence is insignificant. The mountain pass Qafa e Rupës (Qafa e Kuqe) at 2130 m elevation, northwest of Maja e Thatë, detaches it from Maja e Rosit (2524 m), while the tectonic- erosive mountain pass of Rrethi i Bardhë () in the east detaches Maja e Thatë from Maja e Lugut të Ujit (2482 m), which is part of Kolata block. Glacial activity north of the mountain has created several small cirques in its surrounding troughs (): Lugu i Rupës, which stretches along east-west direction and Lugu i Persllopit, northeast of the mountain, along SW-NE direction. The shortest trail connects its nearest village, Valbonë with Maja e Thatë through Lugu i Rupës. The mountain can be reached from Vusanje in Montenegro through the mountain pass of Persllopi (2039 m), which is part of the border between the two countries, which subsequently continues with Persllopi trough () west of Kollata mountain (2555 m) until the feet of the rocky northeastern face of Maja e Thatë. The peak seems insurmountable from the northeast owing to its very steep rocky faces, which start directly from the trough surface. The summit is a sharp ridge, and its crest has jagged edges. Horizontal monoclines are visible through all the mountain's northern rocky face, giving it an imposing appearance. Maja e Thatë can be seen quite impressively from the highest peaks of Grykat e Hapëta – Zhaborre mountain range, running in southwest-northeast direction, south of the villages Rragam and Valbonë, as well as from Maja e Rosit. ==Geology== The whole territory of Albania lies on the assemblage of geological structures called Albanides, which are part of the Alpine orogenic belt. Albanian Alps are included in the External Albanides and form the Alps Zone, consisting of limestone monoclines, combined with smaller anticlines. Carbonate rocks are the constituents of Kolata massif and Maja e Thatë, as a part of this massif, is entirely composed of Triassic dolomite and limestone formations. On the northern rocky face of Maja e Thatë mountain, monoclines are clearly visible from the level of the trough of Rupa, up to the very summit. Ice and frost's erosive activity and the periglacial environment on the surface of Kolata massif have led to solifluction, reaching the eluvian stratum. == Biodiversity == Biota is especially rich in the southern and southwestern part of the mountain, mostly favoured by the abundant water sources of Valbonë river and the stream of Kukaj. The European black pine (Pinus nigra) and Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii, P. leucodermis) as well as beech (Fagus Sylvatica L.) are widely spread in the south and west of the mountain. The Norway spruce (Picea excelsa) is sparsely found in the lowest slopes and mostly in the valley of Valbona. Because of the diversity of natural conditions, a rich variety of animals lives in the Alps region and in Maja e Thatë's area specifically. The most common animals are wolf, fox, the European hare (Lepus europaeus), squirrel, and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra). Few specimens of the potentially endangered Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) still live in the central part of the Albanian Alps, while its hunting is prohibited by law. Characteristic birds of this region are the chough (Pyrrhocorax graculus), the shore lark (Eremophila alpestris) and the water pipit (Anthus spinoletta). The most widespread species are the rock partridge (Alectoris graeca) and golden eagle, which is also Albania’s national animal. The waters of Valbonë river are a notable habitat of trout. == Attractions == The hanging glacial valley of Kukaj and Maja Jezercë's round summit (2694 m) on the central background Maja e Thatë has a well-distinguished peak and represents a tourist attraction for nature and mountain lovers, mountaineers and hikers in general. Apart for the mountain's aesthetic values, three natural monuments are located in its southern vicinity. ;Cave of Haxhia The Cave of Haxhia, a Nature Monument of Albania, is located on the southern slopes of Maja e Thatë, near Valbonë village, at above sea level. Its length was previously affirmed as being long, but in summer 2009, Polish speleo-expeditions explored length of the cave. A very cold water spring of was discovered inside it. ;Hanging glacial valley of Kukaj The hanging glacial valley of Kukaj () lies beneath the southwestern slopes of Maja e Thatë, surrounding the stream of Kukaj, (a tributary of Valbonë river) between the massif of Jezercë in the west and that of Kolata in the east. It is long and covered by beech forest and European black pine. The valley is a Nature Monument of Albania. ;Norway spruce of Valbona Situated on the valley of Valbonë, between the villages of Rragam and Valbonë, the Norway spruce of Valbona (), is the largest forest of its kind in Albania. It is declared a Nature Monument of Albania. == Cultural works == Maja e Thatë and the Valley of Valbona are the subject of several paintings by the Albanian contemporary painter Pashk Përvathi. They are the central theme of his landscape oil painting Maja e Thatë, Valbonë (dimensions by ) which was exhibited in Pristina, in the Art Gallery of Kosovo. == See also == *Albanian Alps *Geography of Albania *List of European ultra-prominent peaks *Valbonë Valley National Park == References  External links == *Journey to Valbona *Valbona Valley at visitkukesregion.org Category:Mountains of Albania Category:Prokletije ","title":"Maja e Thatë"},{"id":"35291363","text":"Basta che non si sappia in giro is a 1976 Italian anthology comedy film directed by Luigi Comencini, Nanni Loy and Luigi Magni.

He was drafted to Port Adelaide with the sixth selection in the 2011 AFL Draft from the Sturt Football Club in the South Australian Football League (SANFL). He is not related to Liberal politician and former journalist Corey Wingard.https://www.thedcn.com.au/former-sports-journo-announced-as-new- sa-infrastructure-minister/ ==Early life== Wingard was born in Murray Bridge, South Australia. He went to Unity College Murray bridge. His father Trevor is part of the Indigenous Australian Kaurna people and his mother Julie is Irish. Julie works at an emergency accommodation centre. Chad has an older brother and a younger brother, as well as five younger foster siblings. At 16 and 60 kg, Wingard was a member of Murray Bridge's 2009 Imperial Football Club league team that won the River Murray Football League premiership. In that game, he kicked five goals. Wingard also played basketball as a kid, and was the captain of South Australia's under-16 basketball team. == AFL career == Wingard playing for Port Adelaide in April 2018 Wingard made his debut for Port Adelaide in round 19, 2012 against St Kilda. His breakout game came during Port Adelaide's round 22, 2012 loss to the Brisbane Lions where he received an AFL Rising Star nomination for his 27 disposal, 1 goal and 5 mark performance. For season 2013, which was only his second season, he averaged 21.3 disposals a game and kicked 43 goals. He was named in the 2013 All- Australian team, making him the youngest player to make an All-Australian team since Mark Ricciuto in 1994. Wingard's 2013 season also saw him win the Showdown Medal for his five-goal performance in round 19 against the Adelaide Crows where he was described after the match as \\"Port's most exciting player since Gavin Wanganeen.\\" At season's end, he was rewarded with the John Cahill Medal, making him the youngest player to win a best and fairest at Port Adelaide since Craig Bradley in 1982. Wingard's 2014 season saw his averages go down from 21 disposals per game to 16 per game, however he still managed to kick 43 goals in total. He won the Mark of the Year in round 12 against St Kilda by jumping high on the shoulders of Sean Dempster. Season 2015 is considered Wingard's greatest season to date. He booted a career high 53 goals to be the club's leading goal kicker of the season by kicking multiple goals in every game from rounds 8 to 22 as well as kicking at least one goal in every game until round 23. Wingard also averaged 19.2 disposals a game and was recognised with the All-Australian selection, a stunning achievement for a player having completed just his fourth year at AFL level. At the conclusion of the 2018 season, Wingard sought a trade from Port Adelaide. He eventually requested a trade to Hawthorn, and was traded on 17 October.

The election used the 19 wards created as a result of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, with each ward electing three or four Councillors using the single transferable vote system a form of proportional representation, with 68 Councillors being elected. The 2007 election saw the Scottish Liberal Democrats form a coalition on the Council with the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party. The 2012 election saw the SNP gain an additional 6 seats and become the largest party on the Council, supplanting the Lib Dems. The Tories retained their 14 seats on the Council and as a result became the second largest party. The Lib Dems lost half their Councillors falling from 24 to 12 seats. Independents also increased their overall numbers to 11 seats while Labour and the Scottish Green Party won seats in Aberdeenshire for the first time. Following the election a Tory-Lib Dem-Independent administration was formed and in 2013 they were joined by the 2 Labour members. On 8 June 2015, a new administration was formed by the SNP and a 'Progressive Alliance' between Scottish Labour and 2 Progressive Independent councilors, who had been members of the previous administration. ==Results== Note: \\"Votes\\" are the first preference votes.

There are no particulars surviving relating to his birth apart from the fact that he was born about 1548 of legitimate birth from a noble family in Kilmore diocese (according to the Consistorial Acts appointing him as Archbishop of Armagh).The episcopal succession in England, Scotland, and Ireland, AD 1400 to 1875, by W. M. Brady, vol. 1 (1876), p. 222 However it is likely he was born in the Barony of Tullyhaw which formed the McGovern territorial lands at that time. The surviving McGovern genealogies do not name him specifically but he would have been in about the 14th generation of descent from Samhradhán, the patriarch of the clan, who flourished c. 1100. The name Edmund was common among the McGovern clan in Tullyhaw during the Archbishop's lifetime, as we can see from the 1586 Fiants of Queen Elizabeth I of England which list, inter alia, \\"Edmund son of Brian son of Thomas Magawran of Lisanover, Tullyhaw; Cormock son of Edmund son of Shanglas Magawran of Gortmoye (probably now Gortmore, Tullyhaw) and Edmund son of Cormuck son of Ferrall Magawran of Kilfert\\" (now Kilnavert, Tullyhaw).Fiants of Elizabeth, Section 4813, 19 January 1586 in 14th Report of the Keeper of the Public Records in Ireland 1882, p.143 The McGovern chief of Tullyhaw about the time of Edmund's birth was Uaithne Mág Samhradháin. In the 1590s when he was archbishop, Edmund MacGauran sought refuge among his McGovern kinsmen while hiding from the English government. The 1930s Dúchas folklore collection remembers the incident as- Edward McGovern. Primate of Ireland, was slain by Sir William Russell in 1593. During the time he was in hiding he had a hiding-place beside the present well of Eshveagh in Glangevlin. In a letter dated 26 May 1592 a reference is made to his sisters and mother still living.British Library, Lansdowne 71, no. 49, ff. 100-100v. ==Priesthood== When he completed his secular education, Edmund followed the well-beaten path to Europe and joined a seminary to study for the priesthood, probably in Spain as he had Spanish friends and visited there regularly. He was not educated at any of the Iberian Irish colleges as they had not been founded at the time of his ordination. His particular friend in Spain was Juan de Sanclemente Torquemada, Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela who was educated at the University of Alcalá de Henares in Spain so it is likely Magauran was also educated there. If not then possibly at Salamanca or Santiago de Compostela universities. He was ordained in Rome c.1576 when Pope Gregory XIII gave him permission as a scholar of Kilmore Diocese to be ordained to clerical and all holy orders.Vatican Archives, Dataria Apostolica, Minutae Brevium Lateranensium, n. 18789. It is likely that he returned to Ireland and was appointed to a parish in Roman Catholic Diocese of Kilmore, as Tullyhaw was situated therein. The McGovern's parish was Templeport but the priest in 1576 was Fergal Magauran. Edmund MacGauran is described as a Kilmore priest by John Lynch at the time of his appointment to the See of Ardagh in 1581 and in 1586 he still held the rectorial tithes of the parishes of Kinawley and Knockninny in Kilmore diocese which might indicate he had been parish priest of those parishes before his elevation to the episcopacy.De praesulibus Hiberniae, J. Linchaeo [J. Lynch], ed. J. F. O'Doherty, IMC, vol. 1 (1944 [orig. pubd 1672]), pp. 262–3. Vatican Archives, Dataria Apostolica, Minutae Brevium Lateranensium, n. 24308. The Bishop of Kilmore during the early years of Edmund's priesthood was Hugh O'Sheridan who ruled from 1560 to 1579. The McGovern chief at the time was Brian Óg Mág Samhradháin who died in 1584. Edmund's priesthood witnessed a decline in the hegemony of both the Catholic Church and the McGovern chiefs in Tullyhaw. Another early mention of Edmund Magauran is in connection with the attempt of James FitzMaurice FitzGerald to invade Ireland from Spain. On 14 April 1577 the President Sir William Drury wrote from Dungarvan to the Secretary of State, Sir Francis Walsingham- \\"The intelligence from France is worthy of consideration\\" and he encloses a report dated 19 February 1577 stating- \\"James Fitzmaurice has gone to the Pope, to get his benediction and aid; after his return he will, with a host of French soldiers under M. De L Roche, M. Daukin and his brother, invade Munster. James will visit the Kings of Spain and Portugal, who will give him of their treasure. David Wolf will be sent to the Indies. The spiritual benefices of Munster are all granted by the Pope to James' men. Letters brought from Wexford to James. Two priests from Rome with letters from James will sail presently for Wexford. The French King to persecute the French Protestants and James Fitzmaurice to invade Ireland simultaneously.\\"Calendar of State Papers, Ireland, 14 April 1577, p.112, No. 2 Edmund Magauran was probably one of the two priests referred to in the above intelligence of 19 February as he was arrested and interrogated upon landing along with his co-conspirators. A dispatch from Waterford on 10 May 1577 stated- \\"Examinations of Edmund McGawran, John Wise, Walter White, George Quemerford, Thomas Wise, Dorothy Walshe and Peter Tramlye, relative to the proceedings of James Fitzmaurice and his wife. 4,000 Frenchmen destined for Ireland.\\"Calendar of State Papers, Ireland, 10 May 1577, p.114, No. 14 ==Bishop of Ardagh== Edmund Magauran's value as an emissary from Catholic Europe to the Irish chiefs was recognised by Pope Gregory XIII. who rewarded him with a bishopric. Magauran was praeconised in the Papal Consistory of 2 September 1581 and on 11 September 1581 he was appointed Bishop of Ardagh, a diocese adjacent to Kilmore. The Consistorial Act states- \\"Die 11 Sept., 1581, referente Senonen. Providit ecc. Ardachaden, in Hib. vac., per trans. Reverendissimus Pater Dominus Richardi ad ecc. Kilmoren., de persona Edmundi Macsaruraghan, ipsumque etc.\\"The episcopal succession in England, Scotland, and Ireland, AD 1400 to 1875, by W. M. Brady, vol. 1 (1876), p. 292 Bishop Magauran was neither the first nor last Kilmore priest to hold this bishopric as his immediate predecessor Richard Brady O.F.M., a Franciscan from Cavan, ruled Ardagh from 1576 to 1580 when he was transferred to the See of Kilmore. Furthermore a namesake of Edmund's, Cormac Mác Shamhradháin, the Prior of Drumlane Abbey, was Bishop of Ardagh from 1444 to 1476, while another namesake James Magauran was parish priest of Oughteragh in Kilmore diocese before he ruled as Bishop of Ardagh from 1815 to 1829. As Edmund Magauran was only aged about 34 at the time of his appointment, he must have been highly regarded by his superiors. Pope Gregory XIII later proved this by entrusting Bishop Magauran with a special mission to the Ulster Gaelic chiefs, when he was to attempt to obtain their support for the Geraldine war or Desmond Rebellions (1579–83), which was then raging in Munster. It is regarded as the first Counter-Reformation military crusade in Ireland. Following the reduction of Desmond, MacGauran was exiled from Ireland in 1585 by Queen Elizabeth I of England and he went first to Scotland with some trusty servants. In the summer of 1585 Magauran travelled around Scotland and claimed to have confirmed upwards of 10,000 Scottish Catholics. The English government was afraid Magauran was trying to start a joint uprising in both Scotland and Ireland to overthrow the Protestant religion, so at the request of Queen Elizabeth, the Scottish government issued orders for his arrest but he evaded them by boarding a ship bound for France in September 1585. On the way the ship was captured by Sir Francis Drake on 7 September 1585 and taken to London. However Magauran and his companions were concealed in a hideout in the bottom of the ship and escaped detection when it was searched. The bishop then boarded another ship for France which was attacked by pirates.The History of Our Blessed Lady of Loreto by Orazio Torsellini (English translation London 1608), pp. 480–484 However they escaped and landed in France where they made their way to Paris, arriving shortly before 31 September 1585. Father James Tyrie, a Jesuit priest in Paris, wrote a letter to Fr. Claudio Acquaviva, the Superior- General of the Jesuits in Rome on 31 September, stating- \\"We have had a visit from an Irish Bishop, who has been some time in Scotland, and with Fathers Hay and Gordon. He was entrusted by them with letters, which he eventually threw into the sea when in peril from enemies. From letters by Robert Bruce and others, I extract these particulars. Fathers Hay and Gordon are in the North of Scotland with the Earl of Huntly; Fathers Holt and Dury are in the West with the Earl of Morton i.e., Lord Maxwell at Dumfries. The number of Catholics increases rapidly every day, and the Irish Bishop assures me that during the short time he remained in Scotland, he administered the sacrament of confirmation to at least ten thousand persons.\\"The Counter-Reformation in Scotland by J.H. Pollen (Edinburgh 1921), pp. 58–60. Corroboration of this event is provided by a later report in the same year which suggested that the same number of souls had been reconciled to Catholicism in the previous six months. Bishop Magauran then left France for Spain. The Lord Deputy, Sir John Perrot writing from Dublin on 12 January 1586 to Sir Francis Walsingham, stated- \\"Sir Cuconnaught Maguire is at this present with me here, and telleth me that the Pope's bishop of Ardagh, maintained by O'Rourke, went this last summer to Scotland, and thence to France and thence to Spain, did assure him that Spaniards would land this Spring, either in the west or in the north or in both places, but he durst not deliver this matter to any other but to myself. It was that bishop which Brian McGeoghegan told Captain Nicholas Dawtrey of.\\"Calendar of State Papers, Ireland, 12 January 1586, p.7 In 1586 Magauran left Spain for Rome. On entering Italy he first went on a pilgrimage to the Marian Shrine at Loreto, Marche on foot to fulfill a double vow he made when saved from capture at sea. Loreto is a hilltown and comune of the Italian province of Ancona, in the Marche. It is mostly famous as the seat of the Basilica della Santa Casa, a popular Catholic pilgrimage site and it was the foremost Marian Shrine in Europe at that time. The reason Bishop Magauran gave for this pilgrimage to Loreto was that his escape from Drake's search happened on the eve of the birthday of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who had warned one of his companions in a dream. Magauran spent three days at Loreto and left the above account of his adventures in the shrine.De praesulibus Hiberniae, J. Linchaeo [J. Lynch], ed. J. F. O'Doherty, IMC, vol. 1 (1944 [orig. pubd 1672]), pp. 262–3 He reached Rome before 25 April 1586 as on that date we find him acting as one of the principal co-consecrators of Maol Muire Ó hÚigínn, the new Archbishop of Tuam. Following this visit to Rome he returned to Spain to continue his efforts to extract help with the Counter-Reformation movement in Ireland from King Philip II of Spain. The King selected Magauran to perform the consecration ceremony for the new basilica at El Escorial on 10 August 1586 so he must have been held in high regard. In Spain he associated with the Geraldine exiles from Lisbon such as Maurice Fitzgerald, Edmund Eustace, Charles O'Conor-Faly, and Bishop Cornelius O'Mulrian of Killaloe. ==Archbishop of Armagh== At this time the Archbishop of Armagh Richard Creagh was in prison in the Tower of London and died there in December 1586. Father Creighton, who attended Primate Creagh at his death, was in Paris towards the end of May 1587, and headed for Rome on 1 June 1587 where he conveyed the details of the Primate's death to the Holy See. During Archbishop Creagh's imprisonment, Redmond O'Gallagher, Bishop of Derry, was Vice-Primate of Ireland from 1575 to 1 July 1587 and probably expected to succeed. However Bishop Magauran was on the spot in Rome and although still a young man of about 39, he seemed an ideal candidate to lead the Counter-Reformation in Ireland, in part because of his efforts in the Desmond Rebellion and also because of his leadership of the Irish exiles in Scotland and Spain. In any event on 1 July 1587 MacGauran was translated from Ardagh to the archbishopric of Armagh in succession to Archbishop Creagh. On 7 August 1587, both MacGauran and his friend Juan de Sanclemente Torquemada, who had been appointed the new Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela in Spain on 27 July 1587, received the pallium in Rome from Pope Sixtus V. They had requested the pallium through the same Spanish proxy and after the consistory they travelled together to Spain. The Consistorial Acts state – (1) \\"Die 1 Julii, 1587, R. Card. Senon.

Brady, vol. 1 (1876), pp. 221–223 One of Magauran's first acts as archbishop was to become one of the principal co-consecrators of Tadeo O'Farrell, the new Bishop of Clonfert on 30 August 1587. In 1588 Magauran travelled to Lisbon in Portugal. He was there on 25 January 1588 and had brought with him a part of the skull of St. Brigit of Kildare. He presented this relic in a beautiful reliquary to the Church of Igreja de São Roque, the principal church of the Jesuits in Lisbon. A contemporary account stated- \\"The feast of San Roque was celebrated this year with the accustomed solemnity of a solemn Pontifical Mass to hear the Irish bishop officiate. The best singers in the city were there and assisted by several musicians. Father Jeronimo Dias preached and was heard by the secular nobles and men of quality, as well as various religious orders, many of whom ate that day in our dining hall with three bishops present.\\" The plans to invade Ireland were well under way and in early 1589 Magauran travelled to Brussels and tried to enlist the help of the Irish officers in the Spanish army in Flanders. This came to the notice of the English authorities in Ireland. Sir William Fitzwilliam (Lord Deputy) wrote from Dublin Castle on 14 March 1589 to Sir William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, the Lord Treasurer of England, enclosing \\"Reports touching the King of Spain's new preparations for invasion\\", one of which he had received from Sir Henry Duke, the High-Sheriff of County Cavan, which stated- \\"The arrival of one called Ferres O'Hooin, son to the Cooharbe O'Hooin of Fermanagh. He is the secret messenger of Bishop Magawran and Cahil O'Conor, whom he left in Flanders with the Prince, labouring for forces to come into Ireland. He is in Maguire's country, and intends to return to Spain.\\"Calendar of State Papers, Ireland, Elizabeth 1588–1592, ed. Hans Claude Hamilton (London 1885), p.135 On 7 May 1589 he was granted a passport to go from Brussels to Spain.Brendan Jennings, Miscellaneous documents I, 1588-1634, in Archivium Hibernicum, Vol. XII (1946), p. 71. In the winter of 1590 Edmund asked Fr. Claudio Acquaviva, the Superior-General of the Jesuits, for the services of James Archer and another Jesuit to reopen the Jesuit mission in Ireland. Acquaviva hesitated because he wanted more information before he could authorise a new Jesuit mission in Ireland. On 22 January 1591 Acquaviva denied the archbishop's request.Acquaviva to Edmund MacGauran, Rome 23 January 1591, ARSI, Angl. 41, fols 014r–v In his eagerness to restore Catholicism as the official religion in Ireland, Archbishop MacGauran travelled to Spain and Portugal, seeking financial and military assistance for another uprising. Perhaps Acquaviva's fear that the Society of Jesus would become involved in such military matters was a reason for rejecting the archbishop's request. On 28 June 1591 Magauran was in Madrid where he wrote the following letter (in Gaelic, which is translated here) to a Mr. Mody asking him to convey a message to Captain Oliver Eustace who was with the Spanish Army in Brussels- \\"Edmund Magawran, Primate of Armagh, to Capt. Oliver Eustace, Yrlandes, Brussels. Commendations to Capt. Eustace and tell him that I am very thankful for such business as he hath written to me, and albeit much hindrances have happened to him and to many others of our country by means of Englishmen, yet I hope in God it will not be long before they be free from the said nation. And notwithstanding that the Catholic king and his captains be slow in their affairs, I am certain that the men who are proposed to be sent to comfort the same poor island, which is in distress a long time, will not be slow. I ought not to write much to you touching those causes, for I know that a Spaniard shall be chief governor of the whole army. The Irish regiment is written for, and whether they come or not, come you in any wise at all haste. The good Bishop of Ross is dead at Lysborne. The Bishop of Limerick, Edmond Eustace, Morish McShane, Thomas McShane and John Lacy and his kinsmen hath them commended unto you and to the other Irishmen that are there. No more, but stay not for any business and come to overtake us. Madryd 28 June 1591.\\" The Reverend Bernard O'Donnell stated that he saw the Archbishop in Spain in 1591 and was induced by him to study for the priesthood.Calendar of State Papers, Ireland, 1596-7, pp. 351–354 On 5 January 1592 the Irish State Papers list \\"Edmund Magawran, Primate of Armagh\\", among the Irish leaders who were plotting with Spain. On Pentecost Sunday 14 May 1592 Archbishop Magauran presided over a sung mass at the solemn inauguration of St. Patrick's Church at the Irish College at Salamanca. On 26 May 1592 MacGauran was in Lisbon according to John Howlin-The Lord Primat is here and sought to goe to his contry, but seeing Oroke which was his chiefe frend, is executed in London and that there be sherifes in all his contry appointed by the Lord Deputy,his mother and sisters sported and leaft beare naked. I see not howe his Lordship may goe into Ireland.British Library, Lansdowne 71, no. 49, ff. 100-100v. Brian O'Rourke was Magauran's chief ally in Ireland at the time so when news of his execution on 3 November 1591 reached Magauran, he delayed his return to Ireland until autumn 1592. Magauran held a meeting in early September 1592 at Burgos with King Philip II of Spain, at which meeting the King promised to send Spanish troops to Ireland in the following summer. In the meantime the King arranged and financed Magauran for a trip back to Ireland to prepare the native Irish leaders for the invasion. On 12 September 1592 King Philip wrote from Burgos to Diego de Orellana de Chaves, regarding \\"Edmund Macgauran, the Catholic Archbishop Armaugh of Ireland who is returning to his own country – Orellana is to arrange passage for him and be certain that he has enough money to travel, and to advise the king if the Archbishop should choose to sail from Bilbao instead of Laredo\\". Magauran choose Bilbao, as the Purveyor of Bilbao, Baltasar de Laçama, reported to the King on the measures taken to facilitate Magauran's journey, with a list of the supplies he was to take. The Archbishop departed from Bilbao in early October 1592 with two servants. On the way the ship was attacked by pirates but Magauran escaped by dressing as a sailor and reached Drogheda in December 1592 aboard the ship of a local merchant, James Fleming. He stayed there at the house of Walter Brady, a Cavan merchant, for a couple of days and then headed for Tyrconnell. At Christmas 1592 he held a conference of seven northern bishops in the Franciscan friary in Donegal. This meeting proposed the formation of a Catholic confederacy or league among the nobility and clergy of Ulster and Connaught under the leadership of Tyrconnell. In January 1593 Magauran had travelled on to Fermanagh where he stayed with Hugh Maguire. Sir George Bingham wrote to his brother Richard from Ballymote on 3 January 1593 as follows-James O'Crean came lately out of the north from Hugh Roe O'Donnell, where as he saith, he saw seven bishops. Some of them he named unto me. But the chiefest among them was the Bishop M'Gawran, whom the Pope hath made Lord Primate of all Ireland. They were in great Council for two or three days together, and have some great despatch of certain letters, which shall be sent out of hand (as James O'Crean saith) by Bishop O'Hely to the Pope and the King of Spain. He further learned by the Primate M'Gawran that the King of Spain came into France by Waggon and brought his daughter with him to be married to the Duke of Guise. The Primate himself came in his company, and that the King determined to send two armies this next summer, the one for England, the other for Ireland, and the army that should come for Ireland should come by Scotland and land in the north, but their only want was to have some great man here to be (as it were) their leader or general, and have now thought Hugh Roe O'Donnell to be 'the most fittest' for the same. The Primate himself landed at Drogheda, and staid there two or three days after his landing. All which I have thought good to signify unto you, that you may advertise the Lord Deputy thereof. And if it be his pleasure to lay privy at Drogheda, no doubt the Bishop O'Hely may be apprehended, and with him all their practises will be found out. This Bishop M'Gawran is now in Maguire's country and is most relieved there. More meetings were held with the local chiefs and on 4 April 1593, Archbishop Magauran wrote to King Philip's councillor in charge of British matters, Juan de Idiáquez y Olazábal, to inform him that all the Gaelic lords promised to support a Spanish invasion, amongst whom were O'Donnell, the Bourkes and O'Rourke.Archivio Segreto Vaticano, Acta Camerarii, XII, fol. 68 • letter of MacGauran to Idiaquez On 7 April Hugh Roe O'Donnell followed up with another letter to King Philip confirming it was a good idea to invade as it would cost little and would divert the English from Spanish Flanders. On 11 April 1593, Patrick M'Arte Moyle M'Mahon gave evidence at Monaghan \\"of the assemblies sworn by M'Gawran, the titular Primate, to help the Spaniards, who would arrive before mid-May, 1593\\". A further letter dated 8 May from Enniskillen Castle requested an army of up to 10,000 men by 8 September and was signed by Edmund Magauran, Hugh Maguire, Brian Ogge O'Rourke, six northern bishops and others. All the aforesaid letters from the Irish leaders were entrusted to the Archbishop of Tuam Seamus Ó hÉilidhe but he did not arrive in Spain until September 1593. In the meantime trouble started in Fermanagh when the English appointed a sheriff there in May 1593. Hugh Maguire threw the sheriff out of Fermanagh and about 1 June 1593 held a council with the other Northern chiefs. On 19 June 1593, Moris O'Skanlon upon examination declared-\\"that about Thursday was seven night [7 June 1593], Sir Hugh Maguire, Cormock M'Barron Henry Oge, Alexander M'Donnell Oge, Shane Evarry, brother to Maguire, and the supposed Primate called Edmond M'Gawran, met upon a hill in Slight Art's country [Part of Sir Turlough O'Neill's country bounding upon Fermanagh], where the said Edmond held a book, whereupon the said parties took their oath; but what it was this examinate knoweth not, but by hearsay, for that he stood sixty yards off, and as he heard it was that they should faithfully join together in all their doings and actions. The cause of his knowledge is that he was then present and saw every of them take the book from the pretended Primate and put it towards their heads, and heard the report as before; and for a further testimony he saith, that he sent the Seneschal of Monaghan word by his own messenger the same evening that he should be well upon his keeping, for that he feared they would come to prey his country\\". Hugh Maguire then went to O'Rourke's aid against Sir George Bingham, the President of Connacht by attacking Ballymote in County Sligo. Sir Richard Bingham wrote to Burghley on 6 June 1593 (forwarded by Sir H. Bagenall). \\"One M'Gawran who terms himself Primate, doth much mischief riding on his chief horse, with his staff and shirt of mail. Tirone's own foster brothers at the burning of Ballymote\\".Calendar of State Papers, Ireland, 6 June 1593, pp.103 &105 A dispute arose amongst the O'Rourkes and Maguires about the division of the spoils from Ballymote and Archbishop Magauran tried to settle it. He wrote to Hugh Oge O'Rourke in Gaelic, which was translated into English as follows – \\"Magawran, the titular primate of Armagh, hath him commended unto you, Hugh Oge O'Rourke. These are to let you to understand that Maguire appointed me to make as good agreements between you and Brian Oge O'Rourke as possibly I may, which if it may not be effected, to signify unto him which of you hinders it. Therefore I request you to meet a Saturday in some convenient place of appointment, and I with certain gentlemen of Maguires, as Shane M'Hughe's and Brian M'Hughe's children, will meet you. But I request you not to come with any train, and yet not to fail, if ever you will have my favour, to meet for this agreement\\". On 13 June 1593, Thadie Nolan, one of Her Majesty's pursuivants declared at Dundalk that-\\"The Earl of Tirone's great hatred to Marshal Bagenall. Assistance to Maguire. The O'Hagans who killed Phelim M'Tirlough are conversant with the Earl of Tirone. 180 Scots landed. M'Sweeny Ne Doe doth join Maguire with 400 galloglas. The North standeth altogether at the pleasure of the Earl and the pretended Primate Magawran\\". On 15 June 1593, the Lord Deputy and Council were in Dundalk where they examined the aforesaid Patrick M'Arte Moyle M'Mahon who informed them that- \\"Bishop M'Gawran's promise of forces out of Spain. The messages sent to him by Henry Oge O'Neill not to expose himself to danger.\\" On 18 June 1593, Marshall Bagenall stated that he was informed- \\"The Earl of Tirone's command for wasting the barony of Cremorne. Confederacy between O'Donnell, Maguire, the titular Primate M'Gawran, and the Earl of Tirone.\\" On 20 June 1593, William Moate declared at Dundalk-\\"that the Earl of Tirone, O'Donnell, Maguire, and Primate Magawran, received the sacrament together at Strabane\\". On 25 June 1593, Sir Morish O'Cullen, the Chancellor of Armagh, stated at Dundalk that- \\"Thurlough O'Boile has got the treasurership of Armagh from the Primate M'Gawran.\\" ==Death== On 23 June 1593 (The Vigil of St. John or Bonfire Night), Archbishop Edmund MacGauran was killed in Skeanavart townland in the Parish of Kilmacumsy, Barony of Frenchpark, County Roscommon, whilst accompanying Hugh Maguire on his raid into Connacht. There are conflicting dates of the incident owing to the use of both Old & New Style dates. The Annals of the Four Masters state- \\"A hosting was made by Maguire (Hugh, the son of Cuconnaught), to emulate that excursion of Brian O'Rourke. He proceeded first through the eastern part of Breifny, keeping Lough Allen to the left; then through the upper part of Tirerrill, through Corran, and across the bridge at the monastery of Boyle, into Machaire Connacht. Early in the day he dispatched marauding parties through the country around. This night the Governor, Sir Richard Bingham, happened to be on a hill near the gate of Tulsk, in the barony of Roscommon, watching the surrounding country; and a party of his cavalry went forth to scour the hills around the hill on which he was [stationed]; but they noticed nothing, in consequence of a thick fog of the early morning, until they and Maguire's cavalry met face to face. The Governor's cavalry turned their backs to them, and they were hotly pursued by Maguire and his people, who continued to lash and strike them until they arrived at the camp and fortification where the Governor was. They again turned upon Maguire, and pursued him back by the same road, until he had reached the middle of his forces. When the Governor saw that he had not an equal number of men with them, he returned back, he himself and all his people having escaped scathless from that conflict, except only William Clifford, a distinguished gentleman, and five or six horsemen, who were slain on that occasion. On the other side were slain, Edmond Magauran, Primate of Armagh, who happened accidentally to be along with Maguire on this occasion; the Abbot Maguire, (Cathal, son of the Abbot); Mac Caffry (Felim), and his brother's son. These were slain on the third day of July. Maguire was not pursued any more on that day; and, having carried away the preys and great spoils of that country, he proceeded steadily and slowly, from one encampment to another, to Fermanagh.\\"Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland, ed. John O'Donovan (Dublin 1856), vol. VI, Year 1593, pp. 1937–1939 Philip O'Sullivan Beare stated that-\\"About this time Edmund MacGauran, Primate of Ireland, Archbishop of Armagh, was conveyed from Spain by James Fleming, a merchant of Drogheda, bearing a message to the Irish from the King of Spain, to declare war on the Protestants in defence of the Catholic Faith, and informing them that he would very speedily send them aid. The Primate going to Maguire who was already at war and a man of warlike propensities, had no difficulty in persuading him to continue the struggle on the faith of his Catholic Majesty's assurances, and reliance on his sending assistance. Maguire with the Primate and slender forces crossed O'Rourke's country of Breifny and again attacked Connaught. On hearing this, Richard Bingham, an English Knight, Governor of Connaught, sent against him William Gilbert, an Englishman with a small force. They met at a place anciently called 'The Shield of Miracles' (Skieth na Bhfeart). The cavalry of both parties preceded the foot battalions, covering the wings. The day was very dark owing to a thick mist, so that they did not see one another until they came face to face. The trumpet suddenly giving the command, precipitated both into battle. Maguire, who never in the least lost his presence of mind, ran Gilbert through with a spear, killed him, and routed and put his cavalry to flight. The foot closely followed Maguire. The Primate was mounted on horseback and accompanied by only two gentlemen—Felim MacCaffrey and Cathal Maguire. While Maguire was fighting Gilbert, another troop of royalist cavalry fell upon the Primate, who, as he was flying fell from his horse and was killed as he lay on the ground. Felim was also slain fighting. Some foot-soldiers of the Catholic army recognising the Primate's voice, although they could not see him on account of the thick mist, rushed up and thinking Cathal who with drawn sword was defending the Primate, was one of the Protestants, they killed him with many wounds, while the Protestants escaped unhurt, owing to the fleetness of their horses. Maguire was more grieved at the Primate's death than rejoiced at the victory, and laden with booty returned home. Subsequently O'Rourke and Maguire resolving to punish, not only the English Protestants, but also those Irish Catholics who aided them, laid waste O'Ferrall's country of Annaly in Meath. William O'Ferrall tried to rescue the spoils in a cavalry fight, but at the very first charge Maguire put an end to the combat, having by his dexterity and valour pierced William with a spear. On his death the others offered no further resistance, and O'Rourke and Maguire retained the booty\\".Ireland under Elizabeth by Philip O'Sullivan Beare, ed. Matthew J. Byrne, Dublin 1903, p. 71 On 28 June 1593 Sir Richard Bingham wrote to Burghley stating-\\"the killing of the arch-traitor M'Gawran, a venomous person, who hath chiefly contrived all these mischief\\". Bingham's fuller report to the Privy Council on the same date states- \\"M'Guire was on horseback; and all their principal men and himself escaped so narrowly, and the very next unto him, round about him, were stricken down; amongst whom his ghostly father, the Titulary Primate Mac Gauran, lost his life, a man of more worth in respect of the villany and combinations which he hath wrought with the ill Irishry than the overthrow of divers hundreds of the other Beggars; and so generally is his death lamented as if the same were their utter overthrow. And, assuredly (right honorable), he was the only stirrer and combiner of their mischiefs towards in Ulster (and the primer of M'Guire to come forward in their two journeys, making the Irishry full of belief that they should have the aid this summer of Spaniards) and another champion of the Pope's, like Doctor Allen, the notable traitor; but, God be thanked, he hath left his dead carcase on the Maugherie, only the said Rebels carried his head away with them, that they might universally bemoan him at home\\". And again, on 30 June, the Lord Deputy and Council informed the Privy Council- the traitorous titulary Bishop Magawran, with seven or eight of the Maguires, slain in the Maghery. '' The list of those slain on the side of Maguire is given \\"Names of the principal men slain by Sir R. Bingham, on Midsummer Eve, in the encounter with Maguire. The Primate Magawran, the Abbot Magwire, M'Elan the chief leader of the Scots, M'Caffry, chief of his name, Turlough M'Caffrey's two sons, M'Thomas, M'Turlough Moile Magwire, son to the Lord of Clancally, James M'Turlough M'Philip Magwire, Cuconnought M'Hugh Magwire's son, and Con M'Turlough O'Neill.\\" The Archbishop's corpse would probably have been buried in the adjoining graveyard of Caldragh. There is a local tradition that the Archbishop's head was buried by the O'Rourkes in the Cemetery of Kiltoghert, County Leitrim, where a stone sculpture of a mitred head still marks the spot. The sculpture was a keystone removed from the 14th century church nearby and placed on a headstone, which states a Bishop Mac Raith ua Móráin (died 1168) was buried there, which was probably the reason Archbishop MacGauran was buried in the same plot. There are many mentions of the McGovern clan in the various Irish Annals throughout the ages and it is perhaps fitting that the very last such mention is of the death of their most illustrious son, Edmund MacGauran, Archbishop of Armagh, Primate of All Ireland, confidante of Emperors and Popes. == References == Category:1540s births Category:1593 deaths Category:People from County Cavan Category:Martyred Roman Catholic priests Category:Roman Catholic archbishops of Armagh Category:Roman Catholic bishops of Ardagh Category:16th-century Roman Catholic archbishops Category:16th-century Roman Catholic martyrs Category:16th-century Irish people ","title":"Edmund MacGauran"},{"id":"35291456","text":"Jon Rennard (1947 — 29 July 1971) was an English folksinger who recorded two record albums of traditional material as well as his own songs. ==Biography== Born in 1947, Jon Rennard was a folksinger based in Leeds, West Yorkshire.

He is a friendly, wealthy white widower, who runs Trans-Allied, Incorporated. He was born December 3, 1931 in Manhattan, New York. (This made him Conrad Bain's junior by eight years.) Phillip has a daughter, Kimberly, and two adopted African American sons, Willis and his younger brother Arnold Jackson. He also has an eccentric elder sister named Sophia (played by Dody Goodman). Arnold and Willis's mother, Lucy Jackson (portrayed by Todd Bridges' real-life mother), worked as a housekeeper for the Drummonds years ago; her death-bed wish was that Phillip would take care of her two sons. In the series pilot, Phillip welcomes Arnold and Willis into his home. Phillip had dated several women, and would later get remarried to Maggie McKinney, a television aerobics instructor (played by Dixie Carter from 1983 to 1985 and Mary Ann Mobley from 1985 to 1986). Maggie subsequently introduced Sam McKinney (Danny Cooksey), her son from a previous marriage, to the family. Phillip Drummond is the only character to appear in every episode of the series. Phillip, along with Arnold Jackson, made a cameo in the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air series finale \\"I, Done,\\" as a potential buyer of the Banks' mansion. On The Facts of Life, Philip appears in Rough Housing. ==Kimberly Drummond== Kimberly Drummond was portrayed by Dana Plato. She was the only biological child and daughter of wealthy widower, Phillip Drummond (Conrad Bain). She was born on Park Avenue in New York City on October 22, 1964. Kimberly was shown as a caring, loving big sister to both Willis and Arnold, but as a wealthy, coming of age teenager, she suffered from various problems. Several such instances took place in season 6, one of which involved a two-part \\"very special\\" episode on the dangers of hitchhiking, where she was nearly a victim of sexual assault by a deranged man named Bill (Woody Eney). In another episode, no one in the family knew that she was suffering from bulimia, though she later admitted to having a problem and agreed to seek help. Kimberly wasn't in the opening credits in the 7th season nor the 8th season, however, in the 8th season, there were clips of her and she is shown in the last frame of the opening credits for the 8th season. On The Facts of Life, Kimberly appears in Rough Housing. ==Arnold Jackson== Arnold Jackson was portrayed by Gary Coleman. He was the younger brother of Willis Jackson (Todd Bridges), and was born in Harlem, New York City on July 19, 1970. Arnold is a \\"precocious moppet,\\" who was practically known for his catch phrase, \\"Whatchoo talkin' 'bout Willis?\\", which became a part of popular culture and in 2006 was included in TV Land's \\"The 100 Greatest TV Quotes and Catch Phrases\\" special.The Star Ledger, December 11, 2006 Arnold's father died in 1975, and his mother died in 1977. His mother worked as a housekeeper for a wealthy white widower, named Philip Drummond (Conrad Bain). Before her death, his mother expressed her wish for her two boys to be cared for by Mr. Drummond. He agreed, and in 1979, he officially adopted Willis and Arnold. Arnold is the main character in the series. In many episodes, he is shown as being a selfish younger brother, or coming up with or being suckered into some scheme to keep out of trouble or obtain his desire of the episode. When the boys first move in with Mr. Drummond, Willis wants to move back to Harlem, while Arnold is satisfied with their new surroundings. Willis eventually changes his mind, and they decide to stay with \\"Mr. D.,\\" as the boys initially refer to him. In another episode, Arnold has to fight a school bully named \\"The Gooch,\\" so that he will not pick on him anymore. However, Mr. Drummond does not want Arnold fighting the bully, and ultimately decides that Arnold must make peace with \\"The Gooch.\\" Arnold, however, listens to his brother, Willis, who tells him to fight back. This ended with Arnold getting a black eye, and both boys getting in trouble. Arnold's best friends is Dudley Ramsey (played by TV actor Shavar Ross), who, like Arnold, was adopted. Dudley appears in many episodes, and both are involved in various schemes throughout the series. Steven Mond played Robbie Jayson, Arnold's other best friend, who once pressured him to try drugs. In one episode, Arnold has to have an appendectomy, but is too scared to see the doctor. Arnold, along with Phillip Drummond, made a cameo in the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air series finale, as potential buyers of the Banks' mansion On The Facts of Life, Arnold appears in Rough Housing and in The New Girl: Part 1. ==Willis Jackson== Willis Jackson was portrayed by Todd Bridges. He was the older brother of Arnold. He was born in Harlem on April 27, 1965. The boys' late mother was a housekeeper named Lucy, for a wealthy White man, named Phillip Drummond, and her deathbed wish was that he would take care of her two kids, and Philip Drummond officially adopted them in 1979. Willis's catch phrase is \\"Say what?\\" Willis was portrayed alternately as rebellious and responsible. In one episode, Willis joins a gang named \\"The Tarantulas.\\" Willis also had a girlfriend, named Charlene DuPrey, portrayed by Janet Jackson of both the television shows Good Times and Fame. Jackson appeared from the show's third season (1980–1981) until 1984, through the show's sixth season. Bridges' role as Willis Jackson started to fade, because of casting changes in the 1984–1985 season, when Danny Cooksey was added as Sam McKinney, his and Arnold's new younger stepbrother. Bridges did not appear as often in the show's final season, though his name remained in the opening credits. On The Facts of Life, Willis appears in Rough Housing and in Bought and Sold. ==Edna Garrett== Edna Garrett was portrayed by Charlotte Rae. She was Mr. Drummond's housekeeper from 1978 to 1979. She left the show midway through the second season to take a job as housemother and dietitian at Eastland School, the school Kimberly attends in Peekskill, New York. She returned as a guest star in the wedding episode. ==References== Category:1970s television-related lists Category:1980s television-related lists Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:Lists of American sitcom television characters ","title":"List of Diff'rent Strokes characters"},{"id":"35291488","text":"Emrys Roberts (1929 - 30 March 2012) was a Welsh language poet and author, who was Archdruid of the National Eisteddfod of Wales.

Her father had promised that her male descendants would be allowed to keep Bingenheim after her death, however, only two daughters survived their father.

For example, the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent for Lyme disease, infects the tick vector as a larva, and the infection is maintained when it molts to a nymph and later develops as an adult. This type of transmission is seen in other parasites like viruses or Rickettsia. In addition to ticks, mites are another common vector. Some sources consider transstadial transmission a type of horizontal transmission, whereas other sources consider it vertical or partial vertical transmission. Transstadial blockage could be considered the opposite of transstadial transmission, where the parasite cannot be carried over from one life stage to the next.

In 1992, he joined the protests against the military-installed government of Suchinda Kraprayoon, that are recalled as the Black May. He co- founded the Confederation for Democracy. Opposition against Thaksin Weng Tojirakarn opposed the administration of prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. In particular, he criticised the \\"custom-tailored\\" law that allowed Thaksin and his family to sell multi-billion baht shares of their company Shin Corp to investors from Singapore without paying taxes. He joined the citizens' movement against Thaksin alongside Chamlong Srimuang who had already been the spokesman of the democracy movement of 1992. The anti-Thaksin movement became the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), the so-called \\"Yellow Shirts\\", but Weng increasingly alienated from the demands of his political friends. He finally broke with the PAD when they called for a new prime minister appointed by the king under evasion of the parliament's right of nomination (what the king declined after all), or military intervention. Weng perceived demands like these as undemocratic and accused the \\"Yellow Shirts\\" of developing in a neo-Nazi-like, selfish, corrupt and terrorist direction. Activism in the UDD After the 2006 Thai coup d'état, that ousted Prime Minister Thaksin, and the installation of a military-backed government, Weng approached the opposite political camp, the pro-Thaksin \\"Red Shirts\\". After the fierce \\"Red Shirts\\" protests against the government from March to May 2010, and the bloody military crackdowns in April and May, Weng, alongside other Red Shirt leaders, surrendered to the police on 18 May and was arrested. On 1 December 2010, his wife Thida was made chairwoman of the UDD. Weng was released on bail terms on 22 February 2011. He was elected member of parliament on the winning Pheu Thai Party list in the 2011 election. In 2014 he issued a verdict in the killing of Kamol Duangphasuk, a well known Thai poet who was killed in his own car. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1951 births Category:Thai physicians Category:United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship activists Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Thailand) Category:Pheu Thai Party politicians Category:Thai politicians Category:Communist Party of Thailand politicians Category:Thai politicians of Chinese descent Category:Confederation for Democracy activists Category:Mahidol University alumni ","title":"Weng Tojirakarn"},{"id":"35291678","text":"The 1989 African Cup of Champions Clubs Final was a football tie held over two legs in December 1989 between Raja Casablanca, and MC Oran. ==Road to the final== { style=\\"text-align: center;\\" -

Headquartered at Flytårnet på Fornebu outside Oslo, the initiative for the station came from recording artist Øystein Sunde and radio veteran Tor Andersen of Radio P4. The Internet-only radio format followed two rejections of application for land-based broadcasting licence in 2007 and 2008. The FM application was for the Oslo and Greater Oslo Region. When the company subsequently folded in 2009, Sunde with his family company owned 21.8% of the shares. Andersen and his partner with their company owned an equally large share. Artist Jonas Fjeld also held a 2.73% share of the company. The content of the 24-hour station is exclusively Norwegian music, and the music archive initially contained 12,000 songs. A particular focus of the station is to present artists that its bigger cousins such as NRK Radio will not give airtime to. The station mostly plays popular music during the day and airs special programming at night. Famous Norwegian recording artists Hanne Krogh and Halvdan Sivertsen are also said to be involved in the project. ==See also== * Radio in Norway ==References * Radio website * Facebook page Category:Internet radio stations Category:Radio stations in Norway Category:Radio stations established in 2012 Category:2012 establishments in Norway Category:Companies based in Bærum ","title":"Ordentlig Radio"},{"id":"35291687","text":"Yolanda Beatriz Caballero Pérez (born March 9, 1982) is a long-distance runner from Colombia.

Sec School is an all-girls Roman Catholic, private, convent school located in Chennai, India, which offers education from nursery level to higher secondary (XII) level. The school is run by the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary. The school's motto is \\"Towards Charity By Truth\\". The school celebrated its platinum jubilee in the academic year 2009/10 with a 75th-year annual day celebration graced by Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. The school has 3000+ students belonging to many religions. Indra Nooyi, chairman and former chief executive officer of PepsiCo is an alumnus of this school, Along with well-known Kollywood actress Samantha Prabhu. ==History== The institute was founded in St. Thomas Convent, Mylapore. In 1888, St. Antony's school was run by the parish priest for the education of Anglo-Indian children. In 1897, the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary sisters took charge of it and it came to be called as St. Thomas European School. In 1909 the name \\"Holy Angels' \\" was given to the boarding house for Anglo-Indian children. But larger accommodations were soon required. Mgr. Teixeira, the Portuguese Bishop of Mylapore since 1928 proposed to sell to the FFM a piece of church property measuring approximately 5 acres at Mambalam (now T. Nagar). In February 1933 the institution purchased the land and plans were made for the construction of an Anglo-Indian School, a boarding home and a convent. Eight rooms were erected by 21 March 1934. Two months later, Bishop Carvalho laid the foundation for a new building in Mambalam(now T.Nagar). On 1 June 1934 Our Lady's Kindergarten was opened comprising the outhouses. The first headmistress was M. Notre Dame de Pompei, born in India to Irish parents. On 2 August 1934 the foundation stone for the new mission was blessed by the Bishop of Mylapore. On 2 July 1935, Holy Angels' was placed in a magnificent new building. On 27 June 1935 Mgr. Carvalho blessed each section of the new construction. Between 1937 and 1940 the original block was lengthened, a wing added and a floor constructed, and the complete building was bridged to the main building. ==Convent== By July 1935 the FMM superior at Mylapore decided that the Holy Angels' institution would need to have a separate community with its own superior. On 5 August 1935 the decision was finalised and a community of nine sisters moved into a wing of the new building. An International Eucharistic Congress was held in Madras from 28 to 30 December 1937, the convent hosted a number of sisters of different congregations. ==World War II== In 1942, the children of the school, the sisters of the convent and the teachers were evacuated to Palmaner. A total of 252 pupils, 14 sisters, 8 lay teachers and 20 housemaids left. Meanwhile, the government authorities requisitioned the Holy Angels' property to be used as Air Raid Precaution Headquarters, the Madras High Court and the Law College for the duration of the war. In the chapel, a section of the main construction at Holy Angels' the Eucharist was celebrated very early on the morning of 22 April 1942. One very valuable item was left standing in the empty chapel: the beautiful and venerated statue of the Madonna, which would guard and protect Holy Angels' for the next four years. This statue of Madonna and the child Christ is a souvenir of Helene de Chappotin and is today housed in St. Thomas convent, provincial house of the Chennai Province. ==Houses== Holy Angels' students are divided into four houses when they are in IV std. The houses are named in honour of Franciscan Missionaries of Mary martyrs: Teresalina house * Colour: Red * Patron: Sr. Teresalina * Motto: Rowing Not Drifting Teresalina house gets its name after Sr. Teresalina a young FMM missionary who came to India in 1947 and was sent to Kashmir. During the Hindu Muslim Riots of 1947 that took place after Independence, she died trying to protect her superior from the bullet of a terrorist. The house colour is red - the colour of sacrifice. Helen house * Colour: Blue * Patron: Mother Mary of the Passion (Helene de Chappotin) * Motto: Towards Charity By Truth Helen House is in blue - the colour of the sky - signifying calmness and quietness. The patron is Mother Mary of the Passion, the founder of the FMM, the institute to which the school belongs. The motto of Helen house and of all FMM institutions is \\"Towards Charity By Truth\\". Assunta house * Colour: Yellow * Patron: Sr. Maria Assunta * Motto: In God We Trust Assunta house has its name from sister Assunta - a young Italian FMM nun who went to work for the poor and the marginalised. Hermine' house * Colour: Green * Patron: Sr. Hermine * Motto: By Adversity To The Stars Mother Hermine was a missionary who led her little flock of nuns to China where they were brutally murdered along with several other missionaries during the Boxer Rebellion.

The Field Museum asked him if he could get a South American canoe for their collection. So in 1966 he purchased two dugout canoes, rigged them as a catamaran and sailed all the way to Chicago. After exhibiting the whole boat on the main floor, the Field Museum kept only one canoe. Francis built a new second canoe out of plywood and the very next year he sailed from Chicago North to Lake Huron, St. Lawrence River. Then, via Newfoundland across The Atlantic with destination Africa. In this trip all his rudimentary navigation instruments failed, he was lost and ran out of water. Off-course by almost 800 miles he was saved by a German freighter and finally after 106 days he reached his destination. From Africa he wanted to get back to the US in a combination balloon-boat. Unfortunately everything that could go wrong did and the whole balloon project was abandoned. Finally he sailed the \\"Sierra Sagrada\\" back to Chicago, this time in only 46 days. This adventure is described in The Voyage of the Sierra Sagrada: Across the Atlantic in a Canoe. The last documents and information from Francis Brenton are dated 1971 when he tried to sail again to England, and he was lost at sea. == Works == * * == References  * A website dedicated to Francis Brenton Category:Year of death uncertain Category:1927 births Category:1970s deaths Category:Sailors from Liverpool Category:English male canoeists Category:People from West Derby Category:Royal Corps of Signals soldiers Category:Australian Army soldiers Category:Military personnel from Liverpool Category:Australian military personnel of the Korean War Category:British Army personnel of World War II ","title":"Francis Brenton"},{"id":"35291720","text":"Collace village Collace from the path to Dunsinane Hill Collace () is a parish in Perthshire, Scotland, northeast of Perth, in the Carse of Gowrie district. The parish boundary includes the neighbouring villages of Kinrossie and Saucher. The traditional industries of the area are farming, quarrying (sandstone) and weaving, but the latter is now gone. Dunsinane Hill, mentioned in the Shakespeare play Macbeth, is located near Collace. King's Seat, a low hill east of the village, is marked romantically on older maps as \\"Macbeth's Castle\\". Bandirran Stone Circle stands just south of the village. ==Buildings== The current Collace parish church building dates from 1812–13 and is on the site of an earlier church dedicated in 1242. Four stained glass windows from 1919 depict scenes from the life of Christ. In the graveyard are important 17th- and 18th-century gravestones, a rare medieval Discoid stone and a conserved mort-house. Next to the church are the remains of a medieval building with a Romanesque arch which was used as the mausoleum for the Nairne family. The chief mansion house is Dunsinnan House, former seat of the extinct Nairne of Dunsinnan baronetcy. An example of a 19th century morthouse is located in the churchyard. ==Notable residents== *William Nairne, Lord Dunsinane (1731-1811) lived in Dunsinnan House *John MacKay Bernard FRSE (1857-1918) brewer, philanthropist and meteorologist lived in Dunsinnan House and is buried in Collace churchyard.http://www.collace.pkc.sch.uk/our%20work%20page%201112/Collace%20Churchyard%20Heritage/famous%20people%20in%20churchyard.htm ==References== Category:Villages in Perth and Kinross ","title":"Collace"},{"id":"35291726","text":"Mercury nitride describes chemical compounds that contain mercury cations and nitrido anions.

Saunders established a long partnership with the architect William Burges, working with him on many of his major commissions, including Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, Cardiff Castle, Castell Coch and Burges's Yorkshire churches.

The death of her two sisters and a beloved cousin affected her deeply and drove her to seek the meaning of life, guided by the strong beliefs of her mother. During a spiritual retreat in April 1856, she had a deep experience of God's love and a call to serve God, which was to guide her for the rest of her life. As a result of this experience, she determined to commit her life to religious service. However in 1859, when Helene was twenty years of age, her mother died suddenly and she took on the responsibilities of mistress of the household.Reidy, M.V., \\"Mother Mary of the Passion\\", The Irish Monthly, Vol. 60, No. 703, January 1932, Irish Jesuit Province In December 1860, with the permission of the Bishop of Nantes, de Chappotin entered the local monastery of the Poor Clares, whose ideal of Franciscan simplicity and poverty drew her. On the following 23 January, while still a postulant, she had a profound experience of God's inviting her to offer herself as a victim for the Church and for the pope. She soon fell ill, however, and had to leave the monastery. ==Religious life== In the spring of 1864, when Chappotin had recovered her health, on the advice of her confessor, she entered the monastery of the Sisters of Mary Reparatrix, a religious congregation just recently founded in 1857 by Mother Mary of Jesus, which had opened a house in Toulouse in 1860. They were an enclosed religious order, dedicated to contemplation and the training of women in Ignatian spirituality through the experience of the Spiritual Exercises. On 15 August of that year, she received the religious habit of the congregation and was given the new religious name of Mary of the Passion. Before the end of her novitiate, however, she was assigned to accompany a group of the Sisters to the Vicariate Apostolic of Madurai in India, which was under the administration of the Society of Jesus. There, in addition to their own apostolate, they were to help establish a native congregation of Religious Sisters. It was there that Sister Mary of the Passion made her first religious vows in the congregation on 3 May 1866. Because of the many talents she had shown, she had gained the confidence of Mother Mary of Jesus, the foundress, and was immediately named the Superior of the community. When she made her final and permanent religious profession a year later, she was appointed as the Provincial Superior of the three communities of the Sisters of Mary Reparatrix in the Vicariate. Under her leadership, some tensions which had previously been experienced by the various communities were apparently ironed out and the work of the congregation began to flourish. Growth reached a point where she was able to staff a new convent in Oocatamund (Udhagamandalam), Tamil Nadu, a popular hill station deep in the Nilgiri mountains, located in the Vicariate Apostolic of Diocese of Coimbatore, established under the authority of the Paris Foreign Missions Society. The tensions which the communities in Madurai had previously exhibited, however, arose again in 1876. This time Mother Mary was unable to resolve them. The 33 Sisters of the Province were forced to choose between testifying against her and her advisory council or leaving the congregation. As a result, 20 of the Sisters left, including Mother Mary of the Passion. They gathered in the new convent in Oocatamund—which was the property of the Vicariate, and, with the approval of the local Vicar Apostolic, resolved to continue their commitment in a new community. Mother Mary then traveled to Rome to secure the permission of the Holy See for this new foundation. On 6 January 1877 she obtained the approval of Pope Pius IX for the group, which was to have an entirely missionary orientation. They took the name of Missionaries of Mary, with Mother Mary of the Passion elected as their Superior. Mother Mary's vision was to maintain their commitment to a life in which the Sisters combined contemplative prayer with their service. One characteristic which the new congregation adopted, which distinguished it from their previous one, was the provision of medical care to the local people, especially for the women of India, who were strictly segregated from men in the traditional system of purdah. Mother Mary had seen the need for this and, as women themselves, the Sisters began to visit homes where they could enter the parts restricted to females. At the suggestion of the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda Fide, responsible for all activities of the Church in non- Catholic countries, Mother Mary opened a novitiate for the new congregation in Saint-Brieuc, in her native region of Brittany in France. The response was great and soon many young women entered the congregation for service overseas. ==Franciscan foundress== Mother Mary had to return to Rome in 1880 to resolve some legal difficulties for the congregation. She had to return yet again in June 1882, and this visit was to prove pivotal in the identity of the congregation. Firstly, she was given approval to open a house in Rome itself, which was a great honor. Secondly, she came into contact with the Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor. As a consequence, she was able to return to her Franciscan roots, and was received into the Third Order of St. Francis at the Franciscan Church of Ara Coeli on the following 4 October, the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi. A period of trial began in March 1883, when allegations arose against Mother Mary. She was removed from office and ordered not to communicate with the Sisters in India. An inquiry was ordered by Pope Leo XIII, in which she was cleared of all charges. At their General Chapter held in July 1884, she was re-elected as the Superior General of the Institute. The Institute continued to grow. On 12 August 1885 they received official recognition as a congregation by the Holy See, at which time they also adopted the Rule of the Franciscan Third Order Regular. They then became the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary. Their Constitutions received final approval in 1896. The Franciscan Missionaries began to be sent out to a number of countries, wherever there was need, even the remotest locations known. They undertook these assignments often facing great personal risk. In 1900, Mother Mary had the experience of losing the community of Sisters in Taiyuan, China, who were executed during the Boxer Rebellion. These 7 Franciscan Missionaries of Mary were canonized in A.D. 2000. ==Death and veneration== Mary of the Passion remained in office as Superior General of the Institute until her death. Worn out, she died after a brief illness in the town of Sanremo in 1904, at the age of 65. At that point, there were 2,000 Franciscan Missionaries of Mary serving in 86 communities on four continents. She was buried in the chapel of the General Motherhouse in Rome. In 1918, an inquiry into the life of Mother Mary was opened by the Diocese of Ventimiglia, in whose territory she had died. After a long period of study and many requests for this action from around the world, the Holy See, under Pope John Paul II, approved the Cause. The unexplained healing of a Franciscan Missionary of Mary from Pott disease was judged as miraculous and due to her intercession. She was beatified by Pope John Paul II, on 20 October 2002, observed that year as World Mission Day in the Catholic Church. ==Legacy== Currently there are about 6,700 Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, citizens of 80 nations, serving in 76 countries around the globe. ==References== Category:1839 births Category:1904 deaths Category:People from Nantes Category:Breton saints Category:French Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:French Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Female Roman Catholic missionaries Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in India Category:Founders of Catholic religious communities Category:Third Order Regular Franciscans Category:Franciscan missionaries Category:French beatified people Category:Franciscan beatified people Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:Venerated Catholics by Pope John Paul II Category:French expatriates in India Category:Breton beatified people Category:Franciscan Missionaries of Mary ","title":"Mary of the Passion"},{"id":"35291910","text":"Hulley is a surname.

The mutiny had been planned the night before its execution, leaving much to chance. Despite its spontaneity, the sentiments behind the coup had been developing since the attempted coup of 1981. The primary complaints of supporters of the coup included the delegitimization of the government, the lack of accountability, its overall ineffectiveness, and the corruption that pervaded it.  Declining legitimacy of the government  In the 1992 election, the People's Progressive Party (PPP) maintained a comfortable 58.2% share of the vote; there was, however, a sharp decline in government legitimacy almost immediately after the election. Citizens increasingly felt the government was no longer responsive to their needs and had been acting in its own self-interest. Citizens argued that the government had become complacent as a result of its comfortable hold on power since the nation's independence 29 years earlier. This sentiment was particularly present among younger voters and youth groups, who felt under-represented by the patriarchal nature of President Dawda Jawara's government. They believed the only route to fair representation had to be outside the Jawara government and thus they were some of the coup's greatest proponents. At the same time, the uncovering and investigation of multiple ongoing scandals revealed the corruption of the Gambian Government. The Jawara government had been embroiled in a scandal involving three high-ranking government officials accused of embezzling millions of dollars from union funds in late 1993. Jawara and his government were reluctant to investigate this scandal and once the officials' guilt was proven they were even more reluctant to punish them, except for seizing and auctioning their houses. This made many citizens very sceptical of the government's complacency with corruption; eventually, domestic pressures resulted in the establishment in June 1994 of a commission to investigate. Jawara's attempt to regain the trust of the people came far too late; the commission had not reached a conclusion in time to save the regime. This incident, and many other scandals, led to the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) continually rebuking the Jawara regime for its corruption, despite Jawara's objection that \\"the extent of corruption under the PPP was nothing like as great as claimed by the AFRPC\\". This was confirmed later in November 1994 when an investigation uncovered considerable corruption and mismanagement of the Jawara government, including accusations of tax noncompliance, the distribution of favourable lands in Banjul to the administration, overpayment of travel expenses, theft of state resources and the nonpayment of government loans.  Ineffectiveness of the Jawara government  Popular discontent with President Dawda Jawara (pictured 1979) contributed to the push for a coup. Another factor leading to the discontent of the Gambian people was the ineffective nature of the Jawara government, which many accused of being ineffectual in its final months, arguing that governmental corruption prevented the country from progressing. Following the December 1992 establishment of the Assets Management and Recovery Commission (AMRC), which aimed to recover debts accrued by Gambian citizens and government officials, the ineffectiveness of government programs became increasingly clear. It was argued that the government had deliberately resisted AMRC efforts to collect debt and had purposefully limited its collecting powers; a result of the government's reluctance for its own debts to be collected. This resulted in more accusations involving the ineffective, corrupt and tyrannical nature of the Jawara government, which even argued the PPP was responsible for the underdevelopment of the country.  Discontent in the military  Though there was discontent among the Gambian public, the coup was executed by junior officers of the Gambian National Army (GNA). It was preceded by growing dissatisfaction in the military. Some of the chief concerns of the GNA included the disparity of living conditions between Nigerian senior officers and Gambian junior officers, which they believed to be indicative of a broader, corrupted structuring of the government. The officers argued the increased incorporation of foreign senior officers into the GNA limited their own opportunities for advancement within the military. The junior officers became angry when they had not received pay for a number of months; they began to plan a mutiny that would later develop into a coup d'état. ==Coup== On 21 July 1994, the USS La Moure County docked in Banjul for an international courtesy call and to conduct a joint training exercise with the GNA the next day. This was broadcast on Gambian radio stations, making public the knowledge that there would be a lack of military presence in the Gambia the next day. With this advantage, along with unrestricted and unmonitored access to military-grade vehicles and the armory, the coup was executed before the GNA had a chance to respond. At 7:30 a.m. the next day, the coup was set in motion at Yundum Barracks, 25 kilometers (15 mi) away from the capital. The coup began as a protest staged by disgruntled lieutenants and junior officers of the GNA, who planned to make demands regarding their lack of pay. The GNA, under the command of these junior officers, seized the airport, a radio station and a power station. Hours later, Jawara and his family fled to the La Moure County in an attempt to gain the protection and possible support of the United States Marine Corps. After being denied intervention by the Americans, the ship left Banjul that afternoon and docked in Dakar, where Jawara disembarked under the protection of American warships. With Jawara having fled the country, the coup organizers were free to secure their control over it and begin the establishment of their own government, which became known as the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) and governed The Gambia until 1996, when a civilian party replaced it. As the most senior officer of the coup organizers, Jammeh was elected to lead the AFPRC shortly after its establishment. Coup organizers included Sabally, Singhatet, Basiru Barrow, Alhaji Kanteh, and Alpha Kinteh. Kanteh and Kinteh withdrew from the plans because they believed the protest was poorly timed; their withdrawal led to the inclusion of Hydara and Jammeh into the coup plans. == Effects of the coup ==  Immediate effects  Immediately following the coup, its leaders banned all opposition parties, established the Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council (AFPRC) as the ruling government of the Gambia, and suspended the constitution of 1970. Jammeh and other coup organizers took further steps to gain public and political support while suppressing all possibilities of opposition to the intervention. In the days following the coup, Jammeh made a number of speeches to both internal and external audiences in which he dedicated himself and the AFPRC to improving the transparency, integrity and accountability of the Gambian government. This move was primarily to gain support or neutrality, asserting that the military intervention was necessary to uphold national interests. In their speeches, the coup leaders also denounced the Jawara government, dedicated themselves to the protection of human rights, and to governing under the rule of law. The coup leaders took over national radio stations and imposed harsh restrictions on the press (which had had considerable liberties under the Jawara government) to prevent the broadcasting of opposition sentiments. These tighter restrictions led to the imprisonment and exile of several Gambian journalists who expressed anti-coup sentiments. The restrictions also resulted in the deportation of other West African journalists, most often on charges dating to colonial rule and with politically charged biases. Human rights violations were not limited to journalists and vocal protesters of the coup: Jammeh's most controversial policies included the re-establishment of the death penalty, which was mostly reserved for political opponents and attempted coup leaders. Through these acts, Jammeh and the other coup leaders were able to legitimize the coup, the new ruling government and the PPP, both internally and internationally. Leading up to the September 1996 election, Jammeh changed the AFPRC from a ruling military body into the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC), and began to campaign as the nominee for the new party. Jammeh won this election, partially due to the lack of major opposition parties, thus legitimizing his government. Propaganda poster of Yahya Jammeh, praising his government's drive for more accessible education Jammeh committed himself and the government to providing more public goods to Gambians. In the first few years after the coup, his administration constructed two new high schools, five new middle schools, a large rural hospital, several rural clinics and the country's first television station.  Responses to the coup  The coup itself had very little political, military or public resistance, a relief to many Gambians after the bloody attempted coup of 1981. The only resistance to the coup came from Tactical Support Group (TSG) officers – who quickly realized that they were outnumbered and outgunned and surrendered their weapons – and from Jawara himself. Jawara begged the coup leaders to return to their barracks but they refused. Despite the paucity of resistance, one of the first acts of the coup leaders was to ban all opposition parties. Many leaders of these parties eventually became nominees for the United Democratic Party (UDP), established in September 1996. In the public sphere, there was a generally positive attitude toward the military intervention, particularly among urban young people, who felt most under-represented in the Jawara era. A study conducted by Wiseman later found that most public supporters of the coup actually opposed it privately but were too afraid to openly declare their opposition. The internal neutrality towards the coup was also reflected in international reactions. After Jawara's flight to the US warship La Moure County in an attempt to secure US military intervention and protection, the US ambassador, following talks with his government, refused to send marines to suppress the coup, disappointing Jawara and other officials of his government. Jawara then was transported to Dakar, the capital of Senegal, by the US warship. He once again asked for military intervention from Senegal. Senegal offered Jawara and many of his officials political asylum but, viewing the coup as a low-ranking affair, refused to offer military assistance. Senegal went on to become the first country to recognize the newly established government in the Gambia as legitimate. The United Kingdom, despite its adamant support of the Jawara regime, also failed to take action to suppress the coup. The British had contested that the \\"rebellion\\" in Gambia would be over in a matter of days and there was little need for British intervention. Despite this initial neutrality towards the subject, sanctions and restrictions were placed on the new regime from November 1994. In response to the coup and the suspension of democracy in the Gambia, major donors such as the EU, US and Japan froze all humanitarian aid to the Gambia and issued travel warnings for the region. In response, the AFRPC established the National Consultative Committee (NCC) to survey public opinion about the coup and the new ruling government. The regime accepted the suggestions of the NCC and shortened the rule of the AFPRC from four years to two before transitioning to \\"democratic rule.\\" == Wider context == The end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union encouraged liberalization and democratization movements in much of Africa; for this reason, the period from 1974 to the mid-1990s is considered the third wave of democratization in Africa, in which many countries changed from militaristic and autocratic states into democracies. Many Western scholars hoped the number of military governments in Africa would continue to decrease, both numerically and in power, in the following decades. Because the Gambia had become a more autocratic state in that period, many scholars consider it paradoxical. The 1994 coup in the Gambia marked the end of the longest-lasting democracy in West Africa and the deposition of one of Africa's longest-serving heads of state. ==See also== *Arch 22 *1981 Gambian coup d'état attempt *2014 Gambian coup d'état attempt ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1994 in the Gambia Category:1990s coups d'état and coup attempts Category:Conflicts in 1994 Category:Politics of the Gambia Category:July 1994 events in Africa Category:Military history of the Gambia ","title":"1994 Gambian coup d'état"},{"id":"35292043","text":"Khalid Mahmood is a Pakistani para-athlete.

He was originally trained in Britain, where he won three handicap races and the King Edward VII Stakes as a three-year-old in 2010. After being moved to the United Arab Emirates he recorded his most important success when he won the Dubai World Cup on 31 March 2012. ==Background== Monterosso, a dark-coated bay horse with a white sock on his right hind foot, was bred in England by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Darley Stud. He was originally registered as being owned by Sheikh Mohammed's son Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum and was sent into training with Mark Johnston at Middleham, North Yorkshire. Monterosso's sire, Dubawi won the Irish 2,000 Guineas and the Prix Jacques Le Marois before going on to a successful stud career, siring winners including Makfi (2000 Guineas) and Poet's Voice (Queen Elizabeth II Stakes). His dam, Porto Roca, was a successful Australian racehorse, winning the Coolmore Classic in 2001. ==Racing career== 2009-2010: early career Monterosso began his racing career by finishing unplaced in a maiden race on the Polytrack surface at Wolverhampton Racecourse in November 2009. In the winter he was campaigned on the all-weather track at Lingfield, finishing second in a maiden on 15 January and then recording his first win in a similar event eight days later. On 6 February he carried top weight of 133 pounds and won a one- mile handicap race at the same venue. Monterosso contested his first turf race in April when he won the Cock of the North Handicap at Ripon by a neck from the filly Eleanora Duse, a subsequent Group Two winner. After finishing second to Green Moon in the London Gold Cup (Johnston felt he had been unlucky) he was a comfortable winner of a handicap at Newmarket under top weight of 130 pounds. His performances since the start of the year had seen his official rating improve from 78 to 104, and he was thereafter campaigned in Group Races. At Royal Ascot, Monterosso contested the Group Two King Edward VII Stakes over one and a half miles. Ridden by Frankie Dettori, he took the lead early in the straight and \\"quickened clear\\" to win by two and a quarter lengths from the subsequent St Leger winner Arctic Cosmos, with The Derby runner-up At First Sight in fourth place. Monterosso's continuing improvement resulted in his owners paying €150,000 to supplement the horse into the Irish Derby at the Curragh on 27 June. He started 3/1 favourite for the race, but was never able to reach the lead and finished fourth to Cape Blanco. Monterosso was again made favourite in the Deutsches Derby three weeks later, but finished seventh behind Buzzword. He returned to England for the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York in August but was \\"never a factor\\" and finished fifth of the ten runners behind Rewilding. At the end of the 2010 season, Monterosso's ownership was transferred to the Maktoum family's Godolphin Racing operation and he was sent to Dubai to be trained by Mahmoud Al Zarooni. Another of Johnston's best three-year-olds, a chestnut named Capponi, also made the move. 2011: four-year-old season On his first start for his new trainer, Monterosso contested the Group Two Dubai City of Gold over twelve and a half furlongs on turf at Meydan Racecourse. Ridden for the first time by Mickael Barzalona he took the lead in the straight and won by one and a quarter lengths from his stable companion Calvados Blues. Monterosso was then brought back in distance to ten furlongs and switched to tapeta for the world's most valuable race, the Dubai World Cup. Starting as a 40/1 outsider he tracked the leaders and stayed on well in the closing stages to finish third, beaten half a length and a neck by the Japanese runners Victoire Pisa and Transcend. Monterosso missed the rest of the 2011 season after contracting colic. 2012: five-year-old season After a break of more than eleven months, Monterosso returned to the racecourse for the third round of the Al Maktoum Challenge at Meydan on 10 March. He finished fourth of the fourteen runners, six and a half lengths behind his stable companion Capponi. For his second attempt at the Dubai World Cup, Monterosso started at odds of 20/1 against twelve opponents on the evening of 31 March. Barzalona settled the horse in the middle of the field before moving strongly through to dispute the lead in the straight. He overtook Capponi one and a half furlongs from the finish and drew clear to win \\"comfortably\\" by three lengths. As he had done when winning the Epsom Derby on Pour Moi, Barzalona celebrated before the finish by standing up in his stirrups and waving his whip to the crowd. After the race the Godolphin spokesman Simon Crisford announced that Monterosso and Capponi would return to England for the rest of the European flat season, although a run in the Singapore Airlines International Cup was also being considered. Monterosso made his next appearance in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on 7 July. He tracked the leaders and briefly reached third place in the straight but faded in the closing stages to finish eighth of the nine runners behind Nathaniel. 2013: six-year-old season Monterosso returned to Dubai in the winter of 2012/2013 but made only one appearance in the 2013 season. On 9 March he finished tenth of the twelve runners in the third round of the Al Maktoum Challenge. ==PedigreeReferences== Category:2007 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Arab Emirates Category:Dubai World Cup winners Category:Thoroughbred family 28 ","title":"Monterosso (horse)"},{"id":"35292168","text":"Henry Burnell (c. 1540–1614) was an Irish judge and politician; he served briefly as Recorder of Dublin and as a justice of the Court of King's Bench. Though he was willing to accept Crown office, he spent much of his career in opposition to the Government. He was one of the leaders of the protest against the policies of the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Henry Sidney, in the late 1570s, and as a member of the Irish House of Commons in the 1580s he successfully opposed Sidney's successor, Sir John Perrot. In the early 1600s he was one of the leaders of the protest against strict enforcement of the Penal Laws. His professional reputation was gravely damaged in his later years when he was convicted and fined for having altered a deed concerning the proper disposition of the 11th Earl of Kildare's estate. He was the grandfather of the playwright Henry Burnell. ==Early life== He was born in Castleknock, County Dublin, son of John Burnell.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221–1921 John Murray London 1926 p.223 The Burnells were a long- established Dublin family, which had settled at Balgriffin; they were descended from Robert Burnell, who was a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) between about 1388 and 1413.Ball p.223 An earlier John Burnell was briefly Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer in the 1490s. The family were staunchly Roman Catholic and their loyalty to the Crown was sometimes questioned as a result. Henry's father had managed to retain his estates after his cousin, another John Burnell, had been executed for his part in the rebellion of Silken Thomas in the 1530s. The elder Henry was still alive, although described as \\"very old\\", in 1577. Henry was at Lincoln's Inn in 1561-2 and was one of a group of Irish students who compiled a book detailing the maladministration of the Pale (those four counties which were under secure Crown control). He returned to Ireland to practice law about 1564. In 1573 he was appointed Recorder of Dublin but resigned little over a year later. His motives are unclear but since he emerged soon after as legal adviser to the Earl of Kildare it is likely that he found private practice more lucrative.Ball, p.223 Even Sir Henry Sidney, a stern critic of Burnell, admitted that there was no doubt of his great success at the Bar, which made him a rich man.Richard Bagwell Ireland Under the Tudors London Longman Greens 3 Volumes 1885-90 Vol. II p.329 ==Cess controversy== The cess, a tax levied on the landowners of the Pale, supposedly for military purposes, had always been unpopular, and Burnell had denounced it as early as 1562. In 1576 the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Henry Sidney, announced ambitious plans to reform and extend it. The landowners of the Pale protested that the cost would be ruinous.Bagwell pp.328-9 Burnell was one of a deputation of three eminent lawyers chosen to petition Elizabeth directly against the cess, the others being Richard Netterville and Barnaby Skurlock. The mission went badly; Elizabeth took grave offence at the challenge to her royal prerogative and at Sidney's urging she imprisoned the three lawyers in the Fleet Prison. Given his family's previous association with Silken Thomas Burnell was vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty. Sidney, while grudgingly calling him the most honest of the three lawyers (if only he would stay out of politics), accused him of being a \\"perverse Papist\\" with \\"a great thirst to rid his country of the English.\\"Bagwell p.329 As opposition to Sidney's plans mounted and he began thinking of asking for his recall to England, the tension eased and the three lawyers were freed in return for making an abject apology.Nolan, Pierce Laurence \\"Richard Netterville\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885–1900 Vol.40 pp.237–8 ==Parliament of 1585== Burnell and Richard Netterville returned to their opposition role in the Irish Parliament of 1585, to which Burnell had been returned as a knight of the shire for County Dublin. The new Lord Deputy Sir John Perrot, like Sidney before him, had an ambitious reform program, but the opposition thwarted him at every opportunity, even insisting on examining his accounts, for which Perrot wished them \\"foul scorn\\". He imprisoned some of the opposition members, but was unable to get his legislative program passed.Crawford, Jon.G A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571–1641 Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p246 Somewhat surprisingly Burnell was once more appointed to the Bench in 1590 as third justice of the King's Bench. However he served only for a single term, which may suggest that it was only a temporary office, or that doubts had once more been raised about his loyalty. ==Penal laws== Burnell was a staunch Roman Catholic and strongly objected to the Anglican settlement; in 1605-6 he was one of the strongest supporters of Patrick Barnewall in his protest against the fines imposed for failure to attend Anglican service and the use of the Court of Castle Chamber to impose religious conformity. Yet again he was arrested but, probably because of his age, he was not imprisoned.Kenny, Colum The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.66 ==Digby v Earl of Kildare== In his last years his professional reputation suffered greatly from the reopening of the Kildare inheritance dispute which had begun 20 years earlier. Lettice Digby, 1st Baroness Offaly was the granddaughter and heir general of Burnell's old client the 11th Earl of Kildare and his wife Mabel Browne. Lettice and her husband deeply resented the fact that the great bulk of the Kildare inheritance had passed first to her uncle and then to her cousin Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Kildare. By 1602 she had learned that a crucial deed supposedly executed by her grandfather, who died in 1585, might have been forged or tampered with by his widow. She and her husband Sir Robert Digby then sued both the present Earl and the aged Dowager Countess. The case went on for over a decade and involved numerous hearings in several different courts.Crawford, p.493 In 1608 the Court of Castle Chamber, the Irish equivalent of Star Chamber, began an inquiry into the forgery allegation, which transformed a private lawsuit into a matter concerning the Crown.Something the Court came to regret, since the case was so complex that for two law terms it was unable to deal with any other business: Crawford pp.293-5 The old Countess admitted that she had consulted Burnell in 1585 about the deed, fearing that it did not adequately protect her jointure, and that Burnell had advised that it did not give adequate protection but that he would make the necessary alterations.Crawford pp.494–5 Burnell himself admitted to having advised on making some alterations \\"but without offence\\" (presumably he meant without criminal intent). The Chamber acquitted the Countess of any crime, but found Burnell guilty of forgery, a \\"grave offence deserving severe punishment\\". He was subjected to a heavy fine and to be imprisoned at the Crown's pleasure, although it does not seem the latter penalty was carried out.Crawford p.496 Jon Crawford in his detailed analysis of the trial cautions against placing too much reliance on evidence from witnesses who were describing the events of more than 20 years past.Crawford p.151 Nonetheless Burnell did admit to having advised that the deed could be altered. Such behaviour from an eminent lawyer, whom even his critics admitted an honest man, seems extraordinary, but the Kildares were his most important clients and he may have wished to retain the Countess' business by obliging her in the matter of the deed. ==Family== Burnell married into the O'Reilly family of Cavan; his wife died in 1605. Of their children only one son Christopher reached adulthood. Christopher was the father of Henry Burnell the younger, who was a leader of the Irish Confederacy and a well-known author, best remembered for his play Landgartha.Ball p.224 ==Death and reputation== Burnell died at Castleknock in 1614. He was remembered as one of the best orators and most eminent lawyers of his time. He was somewhat vain about his legal ability, and was said to boast of his power to invariably persuade judges to find in his favour. Despite the Kildare scandal, he was generally considered to be an honest man, as even Sir Henry Sidney, one of his sternest critics, admitted. ==References== Category:1540s births Category:1614 deaths Category:Politicians from County Dublin Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland Category:Irish MPs 1585–1586 Category:Recorders of Dublin Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Dublin constituencies ","title":"Henry Burnell"},{"id":"35292176","text":"Nzagi (Andrada) is a town, with a population of 60,000 (2014)Citypopulation.de Population of cities & urban localities in Angola, and a municipality in Lunda Norte Province in Angola.Angola Statistics: Lunda Norte .

In 1622, he became Count of Schaumburg and Lord of Gemen. Although he was raised as a Catholic, he made no attempt to change the religious denomination of his territories. During the Thirty Years' War, he had little opportunity to influence events; however he succeeded in protecting his Lordship of Gemen from the worst oppression by imperial and Hessian troops.  Inheritance  He married Catherine Sophia (1577–1665), daughter of Otto II, Duke of Brunswick-Harburg, but the marriage was childless, and when he died in 1635, a succession dispute broke out between the families of Holstein-Schaumburg and Limburg-Styrum in relation to the immediate Lordship of Gemen.

the same day as the other Scottish local government elections. The election was the second using 21 new wards created as a results of the Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004, each ward elected three or four councillors using the single transferable vote system a form of proportional representation.http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/Factsheets/Wards/Multi+member+wards.htm The election in Glasgow attracted the most attention out of the local elections in Scotland as there were many predictions that the Scottish Labour Party would lose control of the council due to losses of seats to the Scottish National Party.http://www.itv.com/news/2012-05-04/snp-expected-to-snatch- glasgow-from-labour-in-scottish-elections/ The Labour administration had suffered from a number of defections of council members to the newly formed Glasgow First party and controversy surrounding Councillor's salaries and contracts.http://www.economist.com/node/21553491 In the end, Labour remained in control, losing just 1 seat, while the SNP gained 5. The Scottish Liberal Democrats were reduced to holding just 1 seat on the Council, the same numbers as the Glasgow First party and the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party who retained their solitary seat. The Scottish Green Party retained 5 seats on the authority. After the elections Labour again formed a controlling administration on the City Council. ==Election result== Note: \\"Votes\\" are the first preference votes. The net gain/loss and percentage changes relate to the result of the previous Scottish local elections on 3 May 2007. This may differ from other published sources showing gain/loss relative to seats held at dissolution of Scotland's councils. ==Districts summary== - class=\\"unsortable\\" align=\\"centre\\" !rowspan=2 align=\\"left\\"Ward ! % !Cllrs ! % !Cllrs ! % !Cllrs ! % !Cllrs ! % !Cllrs ! % !Cllrs ! % !Cllrs !rowspan=2Total Cllrs - class=\\"unsortable\\" align=\\"center\\" !colspan=2 bgcolor=\\"\\"  Lab !colspan=2 bgcolor=\\"\\"  SNP !colspan=2 bgcolor=\\"\\" Conservative !colspan=2 bgcolor=\\"\\"  Green !colspan=2 bgcolor=\\"\\"  Lib Dem !colspan=2 bgcolor=\\"\\"  Glasgow First !colspan=2 bgcolor=\\"white\\" Others - align=\\"left\\"Linn bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"46.04 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 29.44 1 7.03 0 2.73 0 12.09 1 1.06 0 1.61 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Newlands/Auldburn bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"40.98 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 36.11 1 10.77 0 3.61 0 1.56 0 0.71 0 6.26 0 3 - align=\\"left\\"Greater Pollok bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"47.65 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 34.03 2 3.73 0 2.11 0 1.12 0 8.23 0 3.13 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Craigton bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"53.4 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 31.4 2 3.6 0 2.1 0 0.9 0 1.8 0 6.8 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Govan bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"32.22 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 32.63 1 3.16 0 3.31 0 1.26 0 14.46 1 12.98 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Pollokshields 24.19 1 bgcolor=\\"#efe146\\"40.93 bgcolor=\\"#efe146\\"1 22.15 1 8.04 0 2.91 0 0.57 0 1.20 0 3 - align=\\"left\\"Langside 35.80 1 bgcolor=\\"#efe146\\"37.61 bgcolor=\\"#efe146\\"1 7.38 0 8.50 1 7.25 0 1.03 0 2.42 0 3 - align=\\"left\\"Southside Central bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"44.3 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 35.81 2 2.50 0 6.40 0 0.79 0 0.0 0 10.19 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Calton bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"54.6 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 30 1 2.6 0 3.0 0 0.9 0 2.9 0 6 0 3 - align=\\"left\\"Anderston/City bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"50.3 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 29.6 1 4.7 0 10.5 1 1.7 0 0.4 0 2.9 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Hillhead bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"29.45 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 33.06 1 6.54 0 17.62 1 4.10 0 0.22 0 9.01 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Partick West 32.1 1 bgcolor=\\"#efe146\\"33.5 bgcolor=\\"#efe146\\"2 10.33 0 14.71 1 5.54 0 0.29 0 3.53 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Garscadden/Scotstounhill bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"61.6 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"3 27.1 1 2.6 0 2.7 0 1.1 0 0.3 0 4.6 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Drumchapel/Anniesland bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"61.36 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"3 29.26 1 3.62 0 2.63 0 1.96 0 0.30 0 0.87 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Maryhill/Kelvin bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"39.6 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 34.4 2 7.7 0 7.3 0 9.2 0 0.0 0.0 1.9 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Canal bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"44.5 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 31.27 1 2.34 0 9.27 1 1.84 0 0.54 0 10.23 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Springburn bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"57.7 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 30 1 2.7 0 1.5 0 1.1 0 0.5 0 6.4 0 3 - align=\\"left\\"East Centre bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"58.6 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"3 27.7 1 4.0 0 4.8 0 0.9 0 0.6 0 3.4 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Shettleston bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"60.5 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"3 30.9 1 4.2 0 1.5 0 0.7 0 1.4 0 0.9 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"Baillieston bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"50.8 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"2 37.2 2 5.2 0 1.8 0 0.8 0 1.8 0 2.4 0 4 - align=\\"left\\"North East bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"63.61 bgcolor=\\"#EEA2AD\\"3 29.65 1 3.13 0 1.76 0 1.13 0 0.00 0 0.72 0 4 - class=\\"unsortable\\" class=\\"sortbottom\\" C9C9C9\\" align=\\"left\\" Total 46.72 44 32.57 27 5.94 1 5.55 5 2.93 1 1.76 1 4.53 0 79 - } == Ward results == Ward 1: Linn -   } Ward 2: Newlands/Auldburn 2007: 2xLab; 1xSNP 2012: 2xLab; 1xSNP 2007-2012 Change: No change -   } * = Outgoing Councillor from a different Ward.

According to ancient Egyptian beliefs, Isfet and Ma'at built a complementary and also paradoxical dualism: one could not exist without its counterpart.Maulana Karenga, Maat, The Moral Ideal in Ancient Egypt: A Study in Classical African Ethics. (New York: Routeledge, 2003). Isfet and Ma'at balanced each other. Ma'at was to overcome isfet, \\"that which is difficult,\\" \\"evil,\\" \\"disharmonious,\\" and \\"troublesome.\\" Isfet was to be overcome by good and to replace disunity with unity and disorder with order. Asante, Molefi Kete. \\"Maat and Human Communication: Supporting Identity, Culture, and History Without Global Domination.\\" Journal of Intercultural Communication Studies 20 (2011): 22. An Egyptian king (pharaoh) was appointed to “achieve” Ma'at, which means that he had to keep and protect justice and harmony by destroying Isfet. A responsible kingship meant that Egypt would remain in prosperity and at peace of Ma'at. However, if Isfet were to rise, humanity would decay and return to a primordial state. Decay was unacceptable as a natural course of events, which meant that the world was separated from the cosmos and away from order.Goelet, Ogden. \\"Memphis and Thebes: Disaster and Renewal in Ancient Egyptian Consciousness. Journal of The Classical World 97 (2003): 24. The universe was cyclical, meaning it had repeated sequences: the daily sunsetting and its rising, annual seasons and flooding of the Nile. On the other hand, when Ma'at was absent, and Isfet unleashed then the Nile flood failed and the country fell into famine. Therefore, Ancient Egyptians believed through their rituals of the cosmic order it would bring forth prosperity to the gods and goddesses who controlled the cosmos.Silverman, David P. Ancient Egypt. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2003). The principles of the contrariness between Isfet and Ma'at are exemplified in a popular tale from the Middle Kingdom, called \\"the moaning of the Bedouin\\": :Those who destroy the lie promote Ma'at; :those who promote the good will erase the evil. :As fulness casts out appetite, :as clothes cover the nude and :as heaven clears up after a storm.Jan Assmann: Ma'at. Gerechtigkeit und Unsterblichkeit im Alten Ägypten (= Beck'sche Reihe. Bd. 1403). 1. Auflage, Beck, München 1990, . page 58. In the eyes of the Egyptians, the world was always ambiguous; the actions and judgments of a king were thought to simplify these principles in order to keep Ma'at by separating order from chaos or good from evil.Jan Assmann: Ma'at. Gerechtigkeit und Unsterblichkeit um Alten Ägypten (= Beck'sche Reihe. Bd. 1403). 1.

Coffin Text 335a asserts the necessity of the dead being cleansed of Isfet in order to be reborn in the Duat.Rabinovich, Yakov. Isle of Fire: A Tour of the Egyptian Further World. Invisible Books, 2007. Isfet is thought to be the product of an individual's free will rather than a primordial state of chaos. In mythology, this is represented by Apep being born from Ra's umbilical cord relatively late.Kemboly, Mpay. 2010. The Question of Evil in Ancient Egypt. London: Golden House Publications. It was also believed that the physical representation of Isfet was through the god, Set.Wilkinson, Toby. The Egyptian World. (New York: Routeledge Worlds, 2013). ==Role of the King== When the king made public appearances he was surrounded by images of foreigners which emphasized his role as protector of Ma'at and the enemy of Isfet which were foreign enemies of Ancient Egypt. As such, the king is mainly shown 'smiting' foreigners to maintain Ma'at.Wilkinson, Toby. The Egyptian World. (New York: Routeledge Worlds, 2013). The king also maintained the Temple Cult to prevent Isfet from spreading, by ensuring the cults were performed at defined intervals, which were necessary in preserving the balance of Ma'at against the threatening forces of Isfet.Wilkinson, Toby. The Egyptian World.

The North–South Corridor is a series of road projects currently under construction or planning which travel through Adelaide, South Australia that will eventually form a continuous link from Old Noarlunga in the outer southern metropolitan Adelaide suburbs through to Nuriootpa in the inner northern rural area around the Barossa Valley, a distance of over 100 km, aiming to be without a single stop by 2030. The route comprises a number of major road links in the metropolitan area with the final product culminating as, from north to south, the Northern Expressway, the North–South Motorway, and the Southern Expressway. ==Road links== By 2030, all of these major road links are proposed to have been completed, thus making a major route through the Adelaide metropolitan area a much more efficient way to travel. Its expected to take only one hour to travel from Noarlunga in the South to Gawler in the North. When announced, the incumbent government had a strategy to deliver the complete project in ten years from May 2015. The components identified by the Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure, from north to south, are: {  ! colspan=2 Road ! Status ! Opened -  colspan=2 Northern Expressway   13 September 2010 -  rowspan=5  North–South Motorway  Northern Connector   7 March 2020 -  South Road Superway   13 March 2014 -  Regency Road to Pym Street   planned 2022 -  Torrens Road to River Torrens   29 September 2018 -  River Torrens to Darlington   -  rowspan=2  Southern Expressway  Darlington Upgrade   planned 2020 -  Duplication   3 August 2014 - } Sturt Highway The Sturt Highway continues the north–south motor traffic corridor to Nuriootpa as a dual carriageway road with the second carriageway added between 2007 and 2009, providing a total of two lanes in each direction. The Sturt Highway continues beyond Nuriootpa as just one lane each way. The next major bottleneck is the town of Truro which has the highway as its main street. A bypass is proposed in 5 to 15 years from the 2015 integrated plan. Northern Expressway The Northern Expressway, heading north-east towards Gawler in April 2012 The Northern Expressway opened in September 2010 and was subsequently named the Max Fatchen Expressway, as the longest new road project in South Australia for a number of decades. Max Fatchen was a popular author and journalist who had grown up and lived most of his life in the area traversed by the expressway. The 4 lane highway extends from Port Wakefield Road, northwest through 5 interchanges in Penfield (2 interchanges), Andrews Farm, Angle Vale and Gawler River to where it joins the Sturt Highway just outside Gawler. Cycling is prohibited on the expressway. The Stuart O'Grady Bikeway was constructed in conjunction with the expressway and follows the southeastern side of it. North–South Motorway The North–South Motorway is an incomplete planned motorway traversing the inner western suburbs of Adelaide from Waterloo Corner and Virginia in the north to Bedford Park in the south. As a free-flowing north-south route it will be the primary route through Adelaide, bypassing the traffic light intersections along Port Wakefield Road and South Road, and will connect the Northern Expressway and Southern Expressway. For the purposes of construction planning, the motorway is divided into sections of which three are complete and one is under construction. From north to south are the Northern Connector (completed 2020); the South Road Superway (completed 2014); Regency Road to Pym Street which is under construction (projected completion 2022); Torrens Road to River Torrens (completed 2018); and River Torrens to Darlington which is unfunded but presently under investigation. Southern Expressway The Southern Expressway, heading north, before going under the Young Street Bridge in April 2012 The Southern Expressway opened in two stages in 1997 and 2001 respectively, as a one way freeway which was closed for an hour twice a day, and reversed direction to match peak traffic flow; open northwards (towards city) weekday mornings and weekend afternoons, and open southwards (away from city) weekday afternoons and weekend mornings. Duplication of the expressway began in 2011, with the construction of a second carriageway allowing the expressway to operate in both directions at all hours. The duplication opened on 3 August 2014. The northern terminus of the expressway is at South Road in St Marys where it runs through Bedford Park in an open cutting adjacent to Main South Road on the surface; this section began construction in 2016 (projected completion 2020) and replaced the original northern terminus, a signalised intersection further south, and bypassing five sets of traffic lights on Main South Road. The southern terminus of the expressway is at Main South Road, Old Noarlunga. Northbound traffic has free- flowing entry onto the roadway, whereas southbound travellers have a set of traffic lights to exit the expressway. Heading south after the expressway, Victor Harbor can be accessed with one additional set of traffic lights, and traffic to Cape Jervis only encounters three more sets of lights. ==See alsoReferences== * Category:Highways in Australia Category:Roads in Adelaide Category:Freeways and highways in Adelaide ","title":"North–South Corridor, Adelaide"},{"id":"35292669","text":"Christopher, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg-Harburg, also known as Christoph or Christoffel (21 August 1570 in Harburg - 7 July 1606 in Harburg) was Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg-Harburg. == Life == Christopher was a son of Duke Otto II of Brunswick-Harburg (1528-1603) from his second marriage with Hedwig (1535-1616), daughter of Count Enno II of East Frisia.

Vote Leave later became the official campaigning organisation to leave the EU, after having been awarded the status by the Electoral Commission. The organisation managed to recruit the support of a number of high profile politicians, including Conservative MPs Boris Johnson and Michael Gove who became key figureheads. Despite a widespread belief that the Vote Leave campaign was heading for defeat, 52% of those who voted, or 37% of the electorate, voted to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum, therefore meaning that Elliott's campaign emerged victorious. Upon victory, Elliott was praised alongside Vote Leave Campaign Director, Dominic Cummings, as being one of the key masterminds of the victorious campaign.

It continued to exist in various forms until late in the 14th century when it was supplanted by the institution of serfdom, which has often been considered a form of modified slavery. ==Terminology== Polish literature refers to this group of people as \\"unfree people\\" (, ) rather than as slaves (niewolnicy). ==History== The institution of slavery as practiced in the Polish territories during the Early Middle Ages played a lesser (if still significant) economic or cultural role than in other states such as Roman Empire where slavery played a crucial role in keeping economy alive. It existed on the territory of Kingdom of Poland during the times of the Piast dynasty; in fact, the number of slaves rose significantly with the establishment of the Polish state, as most of the slaves were owned by the king. According to Samuel Augustus Mitchell, non-free people were emancipated in Poland in 1347 under the Statutes of Casimir the Great issued in Wiślica, although there are indications that some form of slavery, in practice and law, continued at least till the end of the 14th century. Throughout the remaining history of feudal Poland, particularly in the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth, much of the peasantry was subject to serfdom, which was often likened to slavery. Serfdom was abolished in Poland in the 18th century during the times of the partitions of Poland. ==Features== The niewolnicy came primarily from the ranks of prisoners of war, and were treated as a commodity destined mostly for the largest slave market of its age: Prague. Later, between XI and XII century, ransom was popularised due to acceptance of Christianity, but it covered mostly prisoners of prominence. Some people could also become enslaved due to their inability to pay off their debts, and occasionally enslavement was used instead of a death sentence. Children of niewolni would also belong to that class. They belonged to the king or knights. Niewolni owned by the king were organized in units of tens and hundreds. Those who were not owned by the monarch were among the few in the Kingdom of Poland that could not rely on royal justice. Niewolni had a limited right to relocate themselves, and could own possessions. Over time, their numbers decreased, due in part to some escaping and also because their owners saw it as more profitable to use them as peasants rather than servants (, ). Czeladź would have their own house, and would be little different from regular peasants or serfs. == Present Day == Types of slavery found in Poland include forced labor, forced begging, and forced criminality. Sectors of the Polish economy considered most vulnerable to slavery and other forms of exploitation include agriculture, construction, food processing, housekeeping and cleaning, although problems have also been found in the industrial production and catering sectors. Until recently, some of the people subject to forced labour in Poland were from North Korea. Common techniques for trafficking people into slavery from other countries include false job promises, high fees or alleged debts, rape, and withholding the person's documentation. An example is a 23-year old woman trafficked from Uganda to Poland in 2009. She was promised well-paid employment in Europe and told she did not need money or documentation. She was raped multiple times during her journey to Poland. This woman was able to escape once she arrived in Warsaw, and was eventually able to receive medical treatment from a clinic as well as services from the Ministry of the Interior and Administration's Program of Support and Protection for Victims of Human Trafficking. False offers of employment are usually for sales or agricultural work. Many trafficking victims from Bulgaria and Ukraine are forced into sex slavery. Poland is part of the European G6 Initiative Against Human Trafficking. ==See also== *Jasyr *Saqaliba *Janissaries *Devshirme *Mamluk *Slavery in medieval Europe *Varangians *Tatar slave raids in East Slavic lands *Drang nach Osten *Wendish Crusade *Anti-Polish sentiment *Teutonic Order *Prussia *Second serfdom *Serfdom in Poland *Gulag *Ober Ost *Treaty of Rapallo (1922) *Gestapo–NKVD conferences *General Government *Lebensborn *Labor camp *Extermination camp *List of subcamps of Auschwitz *Collectivization in the People's Republic of Poland *Wismut (mining company) ==Further reading== *Tymieniecki K. – Zagadnienie niewoli w Polsce u schyłku wieków średnich (The issue of slavery in Poland in the late middle ages), Poznań 1933 *Włodzimierz Szafrański.

The early idealists include George Paxton Young (1818-1889) who began teaching at Knox College in 1851, Samuel Dyde (1862–1947), and John Watson (1847-1939) who began teaching at Queen's University in 1872. More recent idealists include philosophers George Parkin Grant (1918-1988), Leslie Armour (1931-2014), and Charles Taylor (born 1931). James Doull (1918-2001) also developed Hegelian idealist tenets among Canadians including a philosophy of history and freedom. Both the British and Canadian idealists draw from Georg W. F. Hegel's absolute idealism. There are three pillars to this philosophy. The first pillar is the response to the materialism of the Enlightenment. Idealists argue that the scientific reason of the Enlightenment artificially suppresses a significant dimension of human experience; that is, the cultural framework and historically inherited ideas with which we make sense of the world around us. Idealists hold that knowledge and reason are socially cultivated, not only with our contemporaries but also with our history. The second pillar is the philosophy of history. For idealists, philosophy includes a study of history. To reflect on what we currently believe we must understand the historical dialogue and the conflict of ideas that has brought us to this point. A wide range of subjects from economic rights to the notion of the family come into consideration, but the central question of idealists is how to reconcile civic unity (or the common good) with individual freedom. The third pillar is the formulation of a philosophy of freedom. The concept of culturally embedded knowledge and the historical approach to philosophy set the groundwork for idea of freedom as something that is achieved through a commitment to the community rather than in opposition to it, as is the case with the contract theory of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke for whom freedom is the absence of external interference with our choices (negative liberty). Freedom for the idealists is achieved through the ethical life of our community, not despite it. By participating in our society, engaging in dialogues with others about our proper ends, and giving and receiving the recognition of others that we are free, we cultivate the elements that make us self-governing (or autonomous) individuals, and hence truly free (positive liberty). == See also == * C.

They occur when a client first comes to seek help from a clinician. The intake interview is important in clinical psychology because it is the first interaction that occurs between the client and the clinician. The clinician may explain to the client what to expect during the interview, including the time duration. The purpose of the intake interview often includes establishing and diagnosing any problems the client may have.Kramer, Geoffrey P., Douglas A. Bernstein, and Vicky Phares. Introduction to Clinical Psychology. 7th edition. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009. 117-118. Usually, the clinician diagnoses the patient using criteria from the first two DSM axes. Some intake interviews include a mental status examination Kramer, Geoffrey P., Douglas A. Bernstein, and Vicky Phares. Introduction to Clinical Psychology. 7th edition. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009. 117-118. During the intake interview, the clinician may determine a treatment plan. In some cases, particular clinician may feel that he or she lacks the expertise to best help the client. It is during the intake interview that the clinician should refer the client to another source.Kramer, Geoffrey P., Douglas A. Bernstein, and Vicky Phares. Introduction to Clinical Psychology. 7th edition. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009. 117-118. During the intake interview, both parties form opinions about one another that can be either positive or negative. The client begins to perceive the characteristics of the therapist during this intake interview and the clinical relationship between the two starts to form here.Hilsenroth MJ & Cromer TD (2007). Clinical interventions related to alliance during the initial interview and psychological assessment. Psychotherapy: Theory, Research, Practice, Training, 44, 205-218. A client’s perception of a clinician during an intake interview can either hinder or encourage them to get further treatment. The more clients perceive positive qualities in their therapists, the more likely they are to attend sessions in the future Kokotovic AM & Tracey TT (1987). Premature termination at a university counseling center. Journal of Counseling Psychology, 34, 80-82. This decision whether or not to continue treatment is usually made after the intake interview takes place. Studies have found that almost all patients make a decision about whether to return or not after the intake interview.Alcázar Olán, R. J., Deffenbacher, J. L., Guzmán, L., Sharma, B., & de la Chaussée Acuña, M. (2010). The impact of perceived therapist characteristics on patients decision to return or not return for more sessions. International Journal of Psychology & Psychological Therapy Approximately fifty percent of psychotherapy patients drop out of treatment and most of these patients do so after they have an intake interview.Wierzbicki M & Pekarik G (1993). A meta- analysis of psychotherapy dropout. Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 24, 190-195. Therefore, it is important that during intake interviews that the clinician expresses to his or her clients that they have a correct understanding of the client and his or her needs and emotions. This helps the client feel secure, and thus makes it more likely that the client will continue to seek treatment.Kramer, Geoffrey P., Douglas A. Bernstein, and Vicky Phares. Introduction to Clinical Psychology. 7th edition. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009. 117-118. Most clinicians conduct their own intake interviews. However, bigger organizations with a larger staff pools may have social workers or other employees who conduct these interviews.Kramer, Geoffrey P., Douglas A. Bernstein, and Vicky Phares. Introduction to Clinical Psychology. 7th edition. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009. 117-118. Interviewers have varying approaches when it comes to conducting intake interviews with clients. The way that the clinician conducts the intake interview sets the tone for the continued course of treatment. Communication style is important during these interviews. Some patients prefer to be asked specific questions by the interviewer, whereas some patients prefer to open-endedly talk about their feelings. In many cases, the interviewer can get a sense of the patients’ preference.Nakash, Ora, Dargouth, Sarah, Oddo, Vanessa, Gao, Shan, Alegría, Margarita. (2009). Communication: Observational Study: Patient initiation of information: Exploring its role during the mental health intake visit. Patient Education And Counseling, 75220-226. It is important that the client build rapport during the interview. It is often beneficial to both the client and the patient to have a balance in which the clinician asks questions and the patient also volunteers certain information. This allows the interview to have somewhat of a conversational flow and become more personal. ==References== Category:Clinical psychology ","title":"Intake interview"},{"id":"35292972","text":"Aire valley power station may refer to one or all of: *Ferrybridge C power station (1966–2016) *Eggborough power station (1967–2018) *Drax power station (1974–present) By the 1990s the collection of three power stations generated 20% of Britain's electricity, and contributed 56% of the Yorkshire and Humber regions greenhouse gas emissions, which was primarily CO2 (~2010). In 2006 the generating capacity was approximately 8 GW total (Ferrybridge C, 2 GW; Eggborough, 2 GW, Drax 4 GW). The power stations were built during the post- Beeching era, close to the Selby Coalfield which supplied them via Gascoigne Wood until the field's closure at the beginning of the 21st century. After the Selby field closure coal was imported to fuel the power stations, much of it through the Humber ports (primarily Immingham Port, also Port of Hull) and other east coast ports (Redcar, Tyne, Blyth), additionally coal was supplied from open cast coal mines in Ayrshire, Scotland, as well as being imported via Scotland (Hunterston Terminal). Ferrybridge and Eggborough power stations were scheduled to close in March 2016.

Many objects, both physical and immaterial, can be defined as \\"Rhodesiana\\"; a painting of a Rhodesian landscape, for example, could be considered as such, as might a song by a Rhodesian artist, or a tale or personality from the country's history.

It renamed itself The Rhodesiana Society in 1958, and published 40 issues of the Rhodesiana journal before ceasing its publication in 1979. After Rhodesia became Zimbabwe a year later, the society renamed itself the Historical Society of Zimbabwe, and began publishing Heritage (later Heritage of Zimbabwe), a similar journal to Rhodesiana, in 1981. ==Rhodesiana market== The term \\"Rhodesiana\\" may be used to describe the theme of a museum or collection, or to summarise the character of goods for sale. Indeed, a London-based dealer of African memorabilia, David Saffery, reported in 2002 that Rhodesiana was one of his best-selling lines, with the majority of customers being expatriates, \\"most of whom still describe themselves as Rhodesians\\". Particularly popular items included civil and military flags, banknotes of the Rhodesian pound and dollar, stamps, documents and medals. Since 1980, Zimbabwean embassies and high commissions around the world have at various times raised money by selling off obsolete Rhodesian passports, documents, tableware, furniture and various curios. The Zimbabwean government itself entered the Rhodesiana market in 2002, when it sold off 9,000 unclaimed Rhodesian General Service Medals. == See also == * Ethos * Culture of Zimbabwe * Americana – a similar concept in the United States * Australiana – a similar concept in Australia * Canadiana – a similar concept in Canada * Kiwiana – a similar concept in New Zealand * Yugo-nostalgia - a similar concept in the former Yugoslav states ==References== Category:Rhodesian culture ","title":"Rhodesiana"},{"id":"35293023","text":"Wasif Manzil (also known as Wasef Manzil and New Palace) was built by Nawab Wasif Ali Mirza Khan under the direction and supervision of Mr. Vivian, officer of the Public Works Department of the Nadia Rivers Division and Surendra Barat, a Bengali engineer.

It is built on the Nizamat Fort Campus between the campus's Dakshin Darwaza (south gate) and the Hazarduari Palace, just opposite the campus's South Zurud Mosque and parallel to the Bhāgirathi-Hooghly River. ==Destruction== An old photo of the landscape garden of the palace with the artificial hill which no longer exists. The palace was extensively destroyed in the 1897 earthquake on 12 June. The whole of the palace's second storey came down within a few seconds. It was repaired later but without the second storey. Adjacent to the palace was an artificial hill and a landscape garden which now cease to exist. ==Features== The palace has been designed to look a little like a castle with small corner turrets on the corners. The palace has a semi-circular pediment with the Nawabs of Murshidabad's coat of arms on it. Now, the palace is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India and has been transformed into a museum. The palace has a garden space in front of it which has a fountain and several marble statues. The garden space is enclosed with a handsome iron railing. The main entrance is a Norman archway with open- work iron doors.

Holly was born and raised in Washington, D.C. and attended public and private schools. When he was 14, he moved with his parents to Brooklyn, New York, and his father taught him to be a shoemaker. While in the national capital and New York City, Holly met several prominent abolitionists, including Frederick Douglass, and by 1848 was working with Lewis Tappan. In 1850, he and his brother Joseph opened their own bootmaking shop. In 1851 Holly married his wife Charlotte and also withdrew from the Roman Catholic Church because it refused to ordain black priests locally. They joined the Protestant Episcopal Church. The young family soon moved to Windsor, Ontario, across from Detroit, where Holly helped Henry Bibb as associate editor of the Voice of the Fugitive, a weekly paper. Holly helped organize the Amherstburg Convention of free blacks in Canada. In 1854, Holly returned to the United States to become principal of a public school in Buffalo, New York. He also attended the first National Emigration Convention in Cleveland that year as an Episcopalian, and became a commissioner of the National Emigration Board. Afterward, Holly traveled to Haiti for the first time, to explore possible emigration options there for free blacks. Holly knew that the American Colonization Society had helped 6000 African Americans to emigrate to Haiti beginning in 1824, but that many had returned because of harsh conditions on the island. Holly believed that free blacks could avoid rampant discrimination by emigrating to Haiti, which had thrown off its colonial rulers, as well as that such emigration would help stabilize the society on the island of Hispaniola, which had experienced many coups. Although he many times requested a commission from the Board of Missions of the Episcopal Church to serve in Haiti, each was denied. ==Religious career== Portrait of Bishop Holly. Holly studied theology and received holy orders. Ordered a deacon on 17 June 1855 at St. Mathew's Church in Detroit, he was ordained a priest on 2 January 1856 in New Haven, Connecticut. Meanwhile, Holly co-founded the Protestant Episcopal Society for Promoting the Extension of the Church Among Colored People, which worked to have the General Convention adopt a position against slavery and eventually became the Union of Black Episcopalians. Rev. Holly served as rector of St. Luke's Church, New Haven, Connecticut, from 1856 until 1861, during which time he made several trips to Haiti, the world's first black republic. In 1857, he published a series of lectures as Vindication of the Capacity of the Negro Race for Self Governance and Civilized Progress and in 1859 he lobbied Congressman Frank Blair for funds to establish the emigrant colony. However, that was denied, and the Board of Missions also denied his fund-raising requests.http://www.blackpast.org/aah/theodore-james-holly-1829-1911 citing dead link Rev. Holly resigned his position in New Haven in 1861, in order to lead 110 African Americans and Canadians to Haiti. Two weeks after his arrival, on June 13, 1861, President Geffrard signed a document declaring Holly a Haitian citizen. However, yellow fever, typhoid, malaria and poor living conditions plagued the emigrants. Holly lost his mother, wife and two of his children, among the forty-three prospective settlers who died during the first year. Many of the emigrants returned to the United States, despite the American Civil War. Nonetheless, Bishop Holly remained in Haiti with his two sons and other dedicated American emigrants. By 1863, they established Holy Trinity Church and schools, and soon other churches as well as pastoral training and rural medicine programs. The Board of Missions began financially supporting the mission in 1865. Rev. Holly also served as consul for Liberia at Port-au-Prince from 1864 until 1874. In that year Rev. Holly both received a D.D. from Howard University, Washington, D.C., and was consecrated as missionary bishop of Haiti by the American Church Missionary Society, an Evangelical Episcopal faction, in a ceremony at Grace Episcopal Church in New York. Presiding Bishop Benjamin Bosworth Smith presided over the ceremony, with the participation of his future successor Albert Lee and New York bishop Horatio Potter. Rt.Rev. Holly became the denomination's first African American ever consecrated, and only the second Black person to become a bishop in a major Protestant Christian denomination. In 1878 Bishop Holly traveled to England as a delegate to the Lambeth Conference, but spent most of the rest of his life within his diocese, on the island of Hispaniola. He received the honorary legal degree (LL.D.) from Liberia College, Monrovia, Liberia in 1882. Bishop Holly also contributed reviews to the Church, the Church Eclectic, and the African Methodist Church. In 1897, Holly both published FACTS ABOUT THE CHURCH'S MISSION IN HAITI, and was also named bishop of the Episcopal Church in the Dominican Republic (two years before the assassination of General Ulises Heureaux, who had brought relative peace to that portion of the island). ==Death and legacy== Jack Holly died in his diocese, at Port-au- Prince, Haiti on March 13, 1911, several months before the assassinations of Anténor Firmin in Haiti, and strongman Ramón Cáceres in the Dominican Republic. These events plunged the island of Hispaniola into another round of civil war, and eventually led to the United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–24). The bishop is buried on the grounds of St. Vincent’s School for Handicapped Children in Port-au-Prince. In 1936, the Haitian government recognized Bishop Holly for his five decades of work for Haiti 25 years after his death, and awarded him its highest honor, Commander in the National Order of Honor and Merit. The aftermath of the 2010 Haitian earthquake postponed plans to celebrate the 100th anniversary of his death. The liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America remembers Holly with an annual feast day on March 13, the anniversary of his death, although some churches translate the celebration of his life and accomplishments to November 8, the anniversary of his ordination as well as less affected by Lenten observances. ==NotesReferences== * Category:1829 births Category:1911 deaths Category:Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church Category:People from Washington, D.C.

As a consequence, some authorities have recommended considering M. erythropterus as a junior synonym of M. spechti. The 2008 study did not include specimens from the type locality of M. erythropterus, leading others to reject the results and continue to recognise it as a valid species, although noting the need for further studies.Herder, F., J.

Musée du Louvre, Paris Triptych of the Sedano family is an oil-on-panel triptych altarpiece by the Early Nethlandish painter Gerard David, usually dated between 1490 and 1498, probably c. 1495. It is noted for its innovative framing and for its rendering of the decorative oriental carpet seen at Mary's feet. The work was commissioned by the Castilian merchant Jean de Sedano, and features the Virgin and child in an enclosed garden. Each wing shows a donor kneeling in prayer accompanied by a saint: John the Baptist is seen to the left, John the Evangelist to the right. The panels are unified by the continuous background landscape of green fields and a serene, deep blue seascape. When the wings are closed, the exterior shows Adam and Eve, thereby creating a contrast between the heavenly interior and sinful exterior. Reverse Art historian Maryan Ainsworth notes that the triptych's dense imagery appears to be \\"a conflation of features of some of the most notable Netherlandish art of the last sixty years\\", indicating that it was created in response to the high demand across Europe at the time for Netherlandish triptychs.Ainsworth, 71 Specifically, the figures are painted in a manner similar to Jan van Eyck's work, while the overall design and composition seem derived from Hans Memling. Maryan Ainsworth of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, sees this as a conscious decision of the artist to align and identify himself as on a par with the masters of Netherlandish art.Ainsworth (1998), 2 In 1503, de Sedano joined the Confraternity of the Holy Blood, a sect devoted to the veneration of a 12th- century relic brought from Jerusalem. The donor appears kneeling in prayer in the left wing, being blessed by John the Baptist, with his young son by his side. His much younger wife is shown in the right panel, presented to the Virgin by John the Evangelist. In the year he joined the Confraternity, de Sedano commissioned David to produce a painting of the Marriage at Cana.Van Der Elst, 96 The triptych was purchased by the Louvre in 1890. ==ReferencesSources== * Ainsworth, Maryan. \\"Implications of Revised Attributions in Netherlandish Painting.\\" Metropolitan Museum Journal, Vol. 27, 1992 * Van Der Elst, Baron.

(6). The recording of the group's 1982 Sunsplash performance was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album in 1986. (2) ==History== Blue Riddim emerged from the group Rhythm Funkshun in Miami in the mid-70s under the direction of instrumentalist and composer Bob Zohn and drummer Steve \\"Duck\\" McLane. (3) Zohn and McLane began regular trips to Jamaica in 1973. During an early trip to Kingston, they visited the Turntable Club and met members of the Soul Syndicate band, a highly sought studio ensemble. Drummer \\"Santa\\" Davis and bassist George \\"Fully\\" Fullwood befriended Zohn and McLane and exchanged musical information with them for years to come. These relationships were vital to Blue Riddim's later success. (3) Rhythm Funkshun added horn players Scott Korchak and Jack Blackett in 1977, and briefly used the name Pat's Blue Riddim before settling on Blue Riddim Band. By the end of the 1970s the group was based in Lawrence, Kansas and was touring the United States—headlining its own shows and opening for Jamaican acts, including Dennis Brown, Big Youth, Culture, Burning Spear, Peter Tosh, and Bob Marley. (3),(4). In addition to McLane, Zohn, Blackett and Korchak were Howard Yukon on guitar, Pat Pearce on keyboards and Drew Myers on bass and trombone. In April 1980, Island Records owner Chris Blackwell paid for demo recordings of 19 tracks, engineered by Jack Nuber in Kansas City. These were never officially released. (5) Flying Fish Records released the band's first studio album, Restless Spirit, in 1981. Lloyd James (a.k.a. Prince Jammy and later King Jammy) supervised the final mix for the album. Blue Riddim self-produced an album at Channel One Studios in Kingston, Jamaica in July/August 1982 and July/August 1983. These sessions were never officially released as a full album. \\"I'm Your Puppet\\" and \\"Higher and Higher\\" were released as singles, the former in Jamaica by Channel One studio manager Chuku Irving and the latter on the band's A Major Label. The group's other full- length album, Alive in Jamaica, is taken from recordings of their August 1982 Reggae Sunsplash performance. (6) Blue Riddim was the first American reggae band to play the annual Sunsplash festival, then in its fifth year. Blue Riddim shared the honor of “best band” and was widely recognized by Jamaican press and radio for its accomplishment. (10) Harmonica player Jimmy Becker, from Chicago, joined the group near the time of the first Sunsplash performance. Becker had lived in Kingston during the late 70s and recorded on studio sessions for Big Youth, the Gladiators, Dennis Brown, and Black Uhuru, among others. (4). Joining the band at the Sunsplash performance were percussionist Noel Simms (a.k.a. \\"Scully\\" a.k.a. Zoot Simms) and Kenny Sutchar on keyboards. Alive In Jamaica was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album in 1986. The band's song “Love People” was included in the soundtrack to the 1986 film Club Paradise starring Robin Williams and Jimmy Cliff. The original motion picture soundtrack also included work by Jimmy Cliff, Elvis Costello, and the Mighty Sparrow. ==Strategic Dance Initiative== In the mid-1980s, the band lost the right to use the Blue Riddim Band name in a dispute with its management company that was later settled out of court. Changing its name to S.D.I. (Strategic Dance Initiative), the core band members continued to perform in Kansas City for the next ten years (but without singer Scott Korchak and Jimmy Becker). Founding member Bob Zohn left the group shortly after the 1982 Sunsplash performance and died of a heart attack in Ft. Lauderdale in June 1987. (7) ==Reunion== The group reunited in 1997 at Epiphany Artists' Sierra Nevada World Music Festival in California and performed subsequent concerts backing Big Youth and Junior Reid in 1998 in Kansas City. The group had informally backed other singers over the years who made cameo appearances with them, including Johnny Osbourne (in Los Angeles, 1983) and Mikey Dread (Catalina, 1985). In December 1999, the group, including Scotty and Jimmy, performed their old repertoire to at Kansas City's Grand Emporium and Lawrence's Liberty Hall. In 2000 they backed both Ernie Smith and Chalice's Trevor Roper in Midwest concerts. In 2007, singer Scott Korchak died from liver disease. The band was inducted into the Kansas Music Hall of Fame the same year. In 2009, the group recorded an album Tribute, produced by Leonard DStroy (Kyle Dykes). Also in 2009, a studio session of mostly instrumentals, Ska Inferno, produced by saxophonist Jack Blackett, was released via Markosa Records. In 2010, Blue Riddim consisted of charter members Steve “Duck” McLane on drums, Jack “Blackie” Blackett on tenor saxophone, with Todd “Bebop” Burd on bass, Jack Lightfoot on trumpet, Jimmy Becker on harmonica, and Joe Miquelon on keyboards. The core group was most recently augmented by Chris Bartak on trombone, Dan Bergner on keyboards, Jimmy Dykes on guitar/vocals and Edward Turner on vocals. Also in 2010, reggae artist and fellow Kansas City native Jack Miller released on CD a live session recorded in San Diego in 1981 under the title Ska Reggae Revival. These recordings had previously been distributed on cassette only. In the same year Rougher Records released \\"Tribute,\\" a collection of Jamaican oldies produced by Todd Burd. In 2011, Todd Burd produced a single, released on 7-inch on Rougher Records, featuring Jamaican deejay Big Youth toasting over the band's original “Nancy Reagan” backing track. “Nancy Reagan” was a non-album novelty- cut originally released on a 12-inch single on the group's own A Major Label. In 2013, Burd produced the band's latest album, a collaboration between Blue Riddim Band and The Rougher All Stars, \\"Enter The Riddim\\" released on Rougher Records.

The double bass bears an original label \\"Nicolaus . Filei Hieronymi Filius An' (drea) Amatus\\" \\"Cremonensis Faciebat Anno 1680\\", the type of label Hieronymus II (also known as Girolomo II) used while still under the guidance and working with his father Nicòlo. This Amati double bass was most lately restored by Barnabás Rácz, Hungary, in 2006. In the same year it was subjected to a dendro-chronological examination by John C. Topham, England, which dates the latest year-rings from 1659 and proves a perfect cross-match with wood used by contemporaries Sanctus Serafin and Antonio Stradivari. In 2010 the instrument was certified by Peter Biddulph. He writes; \\"this double bass is in a very fine state of preservation. It is an exceptionally rare and important instrument, fully characteristic of the work of Hieronymus II Amati in the workshop of his father, Nicòlo Amati. Authentic Cremonese basses of this early period are all but unknown.\\" Several other leading experts also have approved its origins. Considering the life-span of over three centuries, the bass is still in excellent condition; The belly is made of pine in five pieces of narrow to medium grain and has a low to medium arching. The flat back is made of two pieces of Italian ash, with original wings added. The sides are made of the same Italian ash, which Hieronymus II Amati also used for several of his cello's. The head is made of plain maple, cut similarly as scrolls of smaller instruments known of this maker. The original Cremonese varnish is particularly recognizable at the belly. Under UV-light all major parts are homogenous. Late 2010 the instrument was acquired by a chamber-music lover and investor, who generously has given it to Dutch double bassist Niek de Groot, as a lifelong loan. Since then it has been played to a growing audience in many major concert-venues throughout the world. Since 2016 the bass is played by Kenneth Ryland solo double bassist of the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra. www.niekdegroot.nl http://www.peterbiddulph.com/ Category:Amati instruments Category:Double basses ","title":"Hieronymus II double bass"},{"id":"35293189","text":"Per Gustaf (\\"Pelle\\") Seth (born 5 June 1946 in Stockholm)http://www.birthday.se/person/d4d3d745-bc65-7fca-b0e9-16b3a6e274e4 is a Swedish film director, cinematographer and screenwriter. ==Selected filmography== *1987 - Träff i helfigur (TV) *1997 - Beck - Mannen med ikonerna (director) *1997 - Beck - Lockpojken (director) *2006 - Göta kanal 2 – Kanalkampen (director) ==ReferencesCategory:Male actors from Stockholm Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:Swedish film directors Category:Swedish screenwriters Category:Male screenwriters Category:Swedish male writers Category:Swedish cinematographers ","title":"Pelle Seth"},{"id":"35293190","text":"Leandro N.

Udayagiri is a village in Taliparamba taluk of Kannur District in Kerala, India.NREGA report It is about 55 km from Kannur city. ==Economy== The people of this village mainly depend on agriculture for their income. The villagers of this hamlet migrated from the southern parts of Kerala in the early 1940s, most of them from Kottayam and Ernakulam district. These days the economy is driven by remittances from people employed elsewhere. ==History== An aboriginal population of hunter-gatherers, known locally as \\"Maayilyans\\" lived here for generations before the so-called settlers from the southern part of Kerala arrived. They survived on hunting and gathering honey in the vast forests. The Maayilyan community was pushed out of the forests, their way of life, and displaced by the migrants. The \\"Maayilyans\\" became either daily wage workers in the area or survived on making and selling artifacts out of bamboo. During the early days (1950s), the settlers lived in tree houses to escape from the large number of elephants present in the area. The needs of the population were very basic. They cleared forests and planted rice, yucca and bananas. The essential services like local hospitals or schools did not exist. Transportation was very limited. Educational institutions were tens of miles away. The daily staples beyond what they produced, had to come from Thaliparamba, which was about 35 km away by foot. Many early families in the area had to fight years-long, painful legal battles to get their land rights. ==Geography== Udayagiri is a hilly village on the eastern side of Kannur district.

It received the 29th Nihon SF Taisho Award.http://old.sfwj.jp/list.html The story received a manga adaptation with slight disparities in Kodansha's Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine, which was serialized between May 2012 and June 2014, and an anime television series adaptation by A-1 Pictures, which aired in Japan between October 2012 and March 2013. The manga has been licensed by Vertical (itself an imprint of Kodansha USA) and the anime by Sentai Filmworks in North America. It is titled after Antonín Dvořák's Symphony No. 9 \\"From the New World\\", whose Movement II appears in the story several times. ==Plot== Setting In AD 2013, 1,000 years after the modern era, 0.3 percent of the population developed psychic abilities called \\"Canto\\". Soon after these powers manifest themselves, many begin using Canto for violence and crime, and the conscious and unconscious use of these powers altered the wildlife and the environment. This led to a breakdown of modern society and a world war which devastated the human population and caused the fall of modern society. This was followed by oppressive and feudalistic regimes, but these too dissolved in chaos due to the violence of the psychic humans. Eventually, the psychic endowed humans established a stable society by controlling their powers using genetic modification and social conditioning. They made themselves incapable of violence against other humans by implementing Attack Inhibition and creating Death Feedback which would be activated if a psychic human kills another, causing the murderer's organs to shut down and die almost instantly. The villages also used genetically designed animals for various purposes. The mole-like Queerats resemble humanity, are able to speak human language and live in a complex eusocial society ruled by queens. The feline Impure Cats are used to kill children at risk of developing one of the two dangerous disorders: the , who are unable to control their powers, and the , who can suppress the Attack Inhibition and Death Feedback and use their special powers against humans.  Part I  Shin Sekai Yori follows the life of Saki Watanabe, a girl from the town of Kamisu 66. In this era, all humans possess powerful psychic abilities and live an idyllic life in agrarian villages. Despite her parents' fears that she may not awaken her powers, Saki gains her special powers at the age of twelve and joins her friends—Satoru Asahina, Maria Akizuki, Mamoru Itou, Shun Aonuma, and Reiko Amano—in Sage Academy, a special school for psychics. However, the children are unaware that the village government is monitoring and evaluating students through the education system. Based on these evaluations, certain students are removed from society because of reasons such as poor performance (such as with Reiko) or for cheating. The memories of the removed students are erased from the community; Saki and her remaining friends have no memory of Reiko and other students. During an unsupervised camping field trip, Saki and her friends capture a False Minoshiro, a mythical animal revealed to be an ancient library robot. The False Minoshiro explains the violent truth of how the current era came about and what their special powers truly are. While interrogating the False Minoshiro, Saki and her friends are found by the monk Rijin. He destroys the False Minoshiro and seemingly seals away the children's special powers for associating with a demon. On the way back to be judged at the village, Rijin is killed by a rogue Queerat tribe while Saki and Satoru are separated from their friends. They are captured by the rogue Queerat colony. Using objects found during their trip, Saki and Satoru are able to escape their prison. During their escape, they meet a Queerat, Squealer, of the Robber Fly colony who rescues them from their pursuers. Saki and Satoru help Squealer and his colony to defeat the rogue Queerats, later with assistance from General Kiroumaru and his Giant Hornet colony, a colony with an especially close relationship to humans. After regrouping with their friends with the help of Squealer and general Kiroumaru, Saki restores their powers, using the same hypnotic methods the village uses to control children, before returning to the village under the belief that the adults do not know of their transgressions.  Part II  Two years later, as Saki and her friends reach adolescence and develop relationships, Shun starts to distance himself from the others and eventually goes missing. Saki finds Shun in an abandoned house and learns that he has become a Karmic Demon and had been sent to die in isolation. After holding himself back for the duration of their meeting, Shun tells Saki to go while telling her the adults know of their transgressions two years ago before using his powers to take his own life. Soon after, unlike with Reiko, Saki and her remaining friends start to realize Shun's absence despite being unable to fully remember him. In time, Saki learns that the survival of herself and her friends has been orchestrated by the Education board and the Ethics Committee Head Tomiko Asahina, who sees Saki as a potential successor. Later, Mamoru and Maria run away after the Education Board tries to purge Mamoru. Squealer, renamed by the humans as Yakomaru as a reward for his usefulness, helps them by staging their deaths. However, after finding the Robber Fly queen lobotomized and that Yakomaru acquired a False Minoshiro, Saki begins to have dreams of a faceless child that tells her not to find Mamoru and Maria as they must die.  Part III  Now 26 years old, Saki works for the village government in the \\"Department of Mutant Management\\" which oversees the Queerats. Yakomaru's colony slowly ascends to power while conquering other colonies and wiping out the Giant Hornet colony, eventually attacking Kamisu 66 with what is believed to be a Fiend that the Queerats refer to as their \\"Messiah.\\" This is later revealed to be the biological child of Mamoru and Maria who Yakomaru raised after murdering the parents. After evading the Fiend and learning that Yakomaru intends to steal more human infants to create an army to wipe out the human race, Saki and Satoru are joined by Kiroumaru who guides them to the ruins of Tokyo to find the \\"Psychobuster\\"; an anthrax-like anti-psychic weapon. With Yakomaru's forces surrounding them, Satoru attempts to kill the Messiah with the Psychobuster, but Saki destroys the weapon because its use at such close proximity would also have killed Satoru. Saki realizes that the Messiah is not truly a Fiend, but actually a regular psychic like themselves, with one key difference: the Messiah considers Queerats as his kin which is what enables him to bypass the Death Feedback when attacking other humans. With seemingly no options left, Saki and Satoru plead with Kiroumaru for help. After admitting his own disdain towards humans and their treatment of his kind, Kiroumaru agrees to help, but asks for his colony to be spared the humans' retaliation once the revolt is ended. He disguises himself as a human and attacks the Messiah. The Messiah kills Kiroumaru, but upon realizing that Kiroumaru is a type of Queerat, dies due to Death Feedback. With the Messiah dead and his rebellion crushed Squealer is defeated. Renouncing the name the humans gave him, Squealer is sentenced to perpetual torture of the \\"Infinite Hell\\" where his body is simultaneously regenerated and destroyed using psychic powers. However, Saki is troubled when Squealer explains the reasons behind his revolt, claiming that his people are human. Later, Saki learns from Satoru that the Queerats are the descendants of normal humans whose DNA had been altered with mole rat genes to make it easier for the psychic humans to control them, since they will not trigger Attack Inhibition and Death Feedback. Now feeling sorry for Squealer, Saki secretly puts him out of his misery. In the epilogue ten years later, Saki has married Satoru and they expect their first child. Both are positive that the world will be a better place by the time their child grows up. ==Characters== Main characters ; : :Initially, Saki is 12 years old, has short brown hair and argues a lot with Satoru while having a crush on Shun.

However, during the attack on the humans by Squealer, it's revealed that the Queerats disdain humans for the way they're treated. Saki eventually learns to her horror that Queerats are actually the descendants of normal humans who were genetically modified with molerat DNA to enable the humans with special powers to subjugate those who don't suffer the Death of Shame, whom they would otherwise be defenseless against. ; : :Starting off as a lowly member of the Robber Fly colony who once offered help to Saki and Satoru, Squealer eventually attains knowledge and gains political clout to become the supreme commander of the Robber Fly colony, earning the name 'Yakomaru' while exhibiting a machiavellian nature. Despite being a weak and small colony initially, the Robber Fly colony grew to rival the Giant Hornets colony after the second timeskip. He initially appears to be faithful to the humans, but secretly learned the truth of his kind's origin, after which he planned to wipe out the human population and liberate all Queerats.

Commanded by Prince Norodom Sihanouk's personal physician, Colonel Dr. Ngo Hou and known sarcastically as the \\"Royal Flying Club\\",Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 19. the AVRK initially operated a small fleet of four Morane-Saulnier MS 500 Criquet liaison aircraft, two Cessna 180 Skywagon light utility aircraft, one Cessna 170 light personal aircraft, and one Douglas DC-3 modified for VIP transport. At this stage, the AVRK was not yet an independent service; since its earlier personnel cadre was drawn from the Engineer Corps, the Ministry of Defense placed the AVRK under the administrative control of the Army Engineer's Inspector-General Department. The first flight training courses in-country were initiated in October 1954 by French instructors seconded from the airforce component of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps (CEFEO) at the newly founded Royal Flying School (French: École de l'Air Royale) in Pochentong airfield near Phnom Penh, though Khmer pilot students (French: Élèves pilotes Khmers – EPKs) were later sent to the École de l'air in France. Early expansion phase 1955–63 A French-built MS.733 in Royal Khmer Aviation (AVRK) markings. During the first years of its existence, the AVRK received assistance from France – which under the terms of the November 1953 treaty of independence had the right to keep a military mission in Cambodia –, the United States, Japan, Israel, and West Germany,Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 224. who provided training programs, technical aid, and additional aircraft. The French delivered in 1954-55 fifteen Morane-Saulnier MS 733 Alcyon three-seat basic trainers,\\"Morane-Saulnier MS.733 Alcyon – a trainer with Gallic flair!\\". Shortfinal's Blog, 29 June 2013. Retrieved: 1 January 2014. and Japan delivered three Fletcher FD-25 Defender single-seater ground-attack aircraft and three Fletcher FD-25B two-seat trainers,Grandolini, Air Enthusiast 37 (1988), p. 39.SIPRI Arms Transfers Database whilst deliveries by the United States Military Assistance Advisory Group (US MAAG) aid program – established since June 1955 at Phnom Penh – of fourteen North American T-6G Texan trainers, eight Cessna L-19A Bird Dog observation aircraft, three de Havilland Canada DHC L-20 Beaver liaison aircraft,Grandolini, Air Enthusiast 37 (1988), p. 40. seven Douglas C-47 Skytrain transports (soon joined by with two additional C-47 transports bought from Israel) and six Curtiss C-46F Commando transports allowed the AVRK to acquire a limited light strike capability, as well as improving its own reconnaissance and transportation capabilities. A small Helicopter force also began to take shape, with the delivery in 1958-59 of three Sikorsky H-34 Choctaws by the US MAAG, followed in 1960 of two Sud Aviation SA 313B Alouette II by the French and of two Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaws by the Americans in 1963. Although Cambodia was theoretically forbidden of having fighter jets under the terms of the July 1955 Geneva Accords, the AVRK did received its first jet trainers in September 1961 from France, in the form of four Potez CM.170R Fouga Magisters modified locally in 1962 to accept a pair of AN/M2 7,62mm aircraft guns and under-wing rocket rails. By the end of the year, the AVRK aligned 83 airframes of American, Canadian and French origin, though mostly were World War II-vintage obsolescent types well past their prime – US MAAG advisors often described the AVRK at the time as an \\"aerial museum\\" – and training accidents were far from uncommon. The baptism of fire of the AVRK came the following year when its FD-25 Defenders and T-6G Texan armed trainers supported Khmer Royal Army troops in Takéo Province fighting a cross-border incursion by Vietnamese militiamen from the Hòa Hảo militant sect fleeing persecution from the neighbouring Republic of Vietnam.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 213. The obsolete Texans and Defenders were eventually replaced in August that year by sixteen North American T-28D Trojan trainers converted to the fighter-bomber role.Nalty, Neufeld and Watson, An Illustrated Guide to the Air War over Vietnam (1982), p. 114. Also under the US MAAG program, the AVRK received in March 1963 four Cessna T-37B Tweet jet trainers; however, unlike the Fougas provided earlier by the French, these airframes had no provision for weapon systems, since the Americans resisted Cambodian requests to arm them. Structure and organization The main tactical air elements of the AVRK by mid-1956 were a training squadron, a transport and liaison squadron and the 1st intervention (or combat) squadron, all based at Pochentong airfield. As the AVRK expanded its flight and technical branch services, in 1958 the Air Force Command re-organized them more systematically into air wings or \\"Groups\\" (French: Groupements) based on the French Air Force model – the Territorial Group (French: Groupement Territoriale) which handled administrative tasks, the Technical Group (French: Groupement Téchnique) for the maintenance of aircraft and other equipments and the Tactical Air Group (French: Groupement Aérien Tactique – GATAC). This later formation aligned three squadron-sized flight units: *A reconnaissance squadron, the 1st Observation and Combat Accompanying Group (French: 1ér Groupe d'Observation et d'Accompagnement au Combat – 1ér GAOAC); *A combat and ground support squadron, the Intervention Group (French: Groupe d'Intervention – GI); *A transportation squadron, the Liaison and Transport Group (French: Groupe d'Liaison et Transport – GLT). The Technical Group aligned the AVRK's support and technical branches, which comprised the Communications (French: Comunications), Civil engineers and Construction (French: Génie de l'Air/Construction), Flight engineers (French: Mécaniciens Navigantes), Medical (French: Service de Santé, or simply Santé), Transportation (French: Train or Transport), and Military Fuel/Petrol, Oil and Lubricants – POL (French: Service de Essence) services.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 233-234. The neutrality years 1964-1970 In response to the coup against President Ngô Đình Diệm in South Vietnam, Prince Sihanouk cancelled on November 20, 1963 all American aid, and on January 15, 1964 the US MAAG program was suspended when Cambodia adopted a neutrality policy,Chinnery, The rise of the Eagle Flights in Vietnam, the air war over south-east Asia (2016), p. 26. so the AVRK continued to rely on French military assistance but at the same time turned to Australia, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and China for aircraft and training. Already in 1961, Khmer student pilots returning from previous training stints in France had been sent to the USSR for conversion training in Soviet fighter jet types, and in November 1963 the Soviets delivered an initial batch of three MiG-17F fighter jets, one MiG-15UTI jet trainer and one Yakovlev Yak-18 Max light trainer. France continued to deliver aircraft to Cambodia in 1964-65, supplying sixteen night attack Douglas AD-4N Skyraiders and six Dassault MD 315R Flamant light transports, soon followed by more Alouette II and Sud Aviation SA-316B Alouette III light helicopters and ten Gardan GY-80 Horizon light trainers, which replaced the obsolete MS 733 Alcyons. The Yugoslavians provided at the time four UTVA-60AT1 utility transports,Jan Forsgren, \\"Aviation Royale Khmere/Khmer Air Force Aircraft\\". Aeroflight . 22 April 2007.Grandolini, Air Enthusiast 37 (1988), p. 43. whilst the USSR delivered one Ilyushin Il-14 and eight Antonov An-2 Colt transports, and China sent one Chinese-built FT-5 jet trainer, ten Shenyang J-5 fighter jets, and three Nanchang BT-6/PT-6 light trainers. Not to be outdone, the Soviets delivered in April 1967 a second batch of five MiG-17F jets and two Mil Mi-4 Hound light helicopters. Like the other branches of the then FARK, the Royal Cambodian Aviation's own military capabilities by the late 1960s remained unimpressive, being barely able to accomplish its primary mission which was to defend the national airspace. Due to its low strength and limited flying assets, the AVRK was relegated to a combat support role by providing transportation services to ARK infantry units and occasional low-level close air support (CAS) to ground operations. Apart from two modern tarmacked airstrips located respectively at Pochentong and at a Chinese-built civilian airport in Siem Reap, the other available airfields in the country at the time consisted of rudimentary unpaved runways that lacked permanent rear-echelon support facilities, which were only used temporarily as emergency landing strips but never as secondary airbases. Consequently, and in accordance with Cambodia's neutralist foreign policy, few combat missions were flown. AVRK activities were restricted to air patrols in order to protect Cambodia's airspace from the numerous incursions made by US Air Force (USAF), Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) and Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) aircraft. In 1962, during a period of heightened tension with Thailand over the disputed Preah Vihear Temple in the Dângrêk Mountains border area, the C-47 transports of the Liaison and Transport Group (GLT) dropped at night three planeloads of paratroopers over the Choam Ksan district in a show of force intended to intimidate the Thai government. The AVRK C-47 transports resumed the same role again in 1964, when they carried out another battalion-sized parachute drop over two days near Samrong in Oddar Meanchey Province along the Thai border,Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 40, Plate A3.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 176; 214. and landing strips were improvised at Siem Reap and Battambang for the C-47 and An-2 transports supplying the ARK troops. Detachments of MiG-17F jets and AD-4N Skyraiders were also deployed at these locations after the intrusion of RTAF airplanes into the Cambodian airspace, but both sides prudently avoided confrontation and there were no incidents. A more serious clash occurred on March 21, 1964 when a patrol of two AVRK T-28D fighter-bombers penetrated 3.22 Kms (over 2 Mi) into South Vietnam and shot down an L-19 light aircraft in retaliation for a RVNAF strike into Cambodia, killing both the Vietnamese pilot and the American observer.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 214.Jan Forsgren, Cambodia: Khmer Air Force History 1970-1975 (Part 1) - http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/aa-eastasia/cambodia/cam-af-history1.htm It was not until the late 1960s however, that the AVRK received its first sustained combat experience. In early 1968, its T-28D Trojans, AD-4N Skyraiders and some MiG-17F jets were again sent to Takéo Province, dropping bombs on pre-planned targets in support of Royal Army troops conducting a counter-insurgency sweep against armed elements of the Vietnamese Cao Đài militant sect that had entered the province from neighbouring South Vietnam; AVRK combat elements were also deployed in the Samlot district of Battambang Province, where they bombed Khmer Rouge insurgent strongholds. In November 1969, the AVRK supported the Khmer Royal Army in a restrained sweeping operation targeting People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and Vietcong (VC) sanctuaries at Labang Siek in Ratanakiri Province. Some T-28D fighter-bombers, L-19A reconnaissance aircraft and Alouette helicopters provided air cover to the ground operation, whilst a few combat sorties were staged by the MiG-17F jets and AD-4N Skyraiders from Pochentong.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 13.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 215. Pre-1970 organization In March 1970, the Royal Cambodian Aviation had a strength of 1,250 Officers and airmen under the command of Colonel Keu Pau Ann (who had replaced Major general Dr. Ngo Hou in 1968), consisting in most part of flight crew personnel – pilots, instructor pilots, navigators, flight engineers, radio operators, and flight mechanics – and ground technicians – air controllers, radar and radio station operators, meteorologists, maintenance personnel, and auxiliary male and female personnel employed on administrative tasks. The main air elements of the AVRK Tactical Air Group consisted of four flight groups – one advanced training, one attack, one transport and liaison, and one helio – provided with a mixed inventory of 143 aircraft of 23 different types, mostly of French, American, Soviet, Chinese, Yugoslavian, and Canadian origin. Most of the aircraft and personnel were concentrated at the military airbase adjacent to the Pochentong International Airport at Phnom Penh, which also housed the Air Academy and the AVRK Headquarters, being structured as follows: *The Royal Flying School at Pochentong operated an Advanced Training Squadron consisting of three Nanchang BT-6/PT-6, eight Yakovlev Yak-18 Max and twelve Gardan GY-80 Horizon light trainers, plus four Potez CM.170R Fouga Magister (converted to the ground attack role) and four Cessna T-37B Tweet jet trainers (only one was operational by 1970). *The Intervention Group had six Shenyang J-5, twelve MiG-17F fighter jets, one MiG-15UTI jet trainer and one FT-5 jet trainer; sixteen Douglas AD-4N Skyraider three-seat night attack aircraft (only eight were operational by 1968), and seventeen North American T-28D Trojan fighter- bombers. *The Observation and Combat Accompanying Group had eight Cessna L-19A Bird Dog observation light aircraft. *The Transport and Liaison Group operated one Douglas C-54B Skymaster four-engine transport (used as a VIP transport), one Ilyushin Il-14, two Cessna 180 Skywagons, three de Havilland Canada DHC L-20 Beaver STOL utility transports, three UTVA-60AT1 utility and liaison aircraft, six Dassault MD 315R Flamant light twin-engined transports, eight Antonov An-2 Colt and twelve Douglas C-47 Skytrain transports. *The Helicopter Group operated one Mil Mi-4 Hound, one Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw, and two Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw utility and transport helicopters, plus eight Sud Aviation SA 313B Alouette II, and three or five Sud Aviation SA 316B Alouette III light helicopters. In addition to aircraft acquired from or donated by friendly countries, the AVRK between 1962 and 1966 also incorporated on its inventory a small number of planes and helicopters flown into Cambodia by defecting RVNAF pilots, which included three A-1H Skyraiders and two Sikorsky H-34 helicopters, plus one civilian-operated Dornier Do 28A STOL light utility aircraft.Jan Forsgren, Cambodia: Khmer Air Force History 1970-1975 (Part 1) - http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/aa-eastasia/cambodia/cam-af-history1.htm. Security Battalion To patrol its main facilities and aircraft in Pochentong against possible acts of sabotage or enemy attacks, the AVRK command raised in 1967-68 an airfield security unit, the Air Fusiliers Battalion (French: Bataillon de Fusiliers de l'Air – BFA). Similar in function to the British RAF Regiment, the BFA was organized as a light infantry unit comprising a battalion headquarters (HQ), three company HQs and three rifle companhies maintained primarily for airfield security duties and static defence. Permantely allocated at Pochentong airbase and commanded by AVRK Major Sou Chhorn, the battalion fielded some 200-300 airmen armed with obsolete French-made bolt-action rifles, sub-machine guns and light machine guns.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 218. Reorganization 1970-71 In the wake of the March 1970 coup, the Royal Cambodian Aviation was re-designated Khmer National Aviation (French: Aviation nationale khmère; AVNK), though it remained under Army command. Colonel Keu Pau Ann was replaced as the AVNK Chief-of-Staff by his deputy, Major (promptly promoted to Lieutenant colonel) So Satto, with Major Penn Randa becoming deputy Chief-of-Staff for tactical operations and Major Ea Chhong the deputy Chief-of-Staff for logistics. After securing material support from the United States, South Vietnam, and Thailand, the new Khmer National Aviation immediately commenced combat operations, and embarked on an ambitious reorganisation and expansion programme. Shortly after the coup, however, the French military mission suspended all the cooperation with the Cambodian armed forces, thus depriving the AVNK of vital training and technical assistance. China and the Soviet Union also severed their military assistance programs, which resulted in serious maintenance problems for its Shenyang and MiG fighter jets.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 216. With the increase in activity at Pochentong airbase, the AVNK Air Academy (French: École de l'Air; formerly, the Royal Flying School) was moved in August 1970 to more quieter and less congested facilities at Battambang airfield. The director of the Air Academy, Lieutenant colonel Norodom Vatvani organized a road convoy to transport all the technical equipment whilst the instructor pilots flew the Gardan GY-80 Horizons to the new airfield, although the Cessna T-37B Tweet jet trainers were left behind at Pochentong. To provide air cover more effectively to the FANK's six military districts or \\"Military Regions\\" (French: Regions Militaires), the AVNK Command envisaged the creation of three Air Force districts, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Air Regions (French: Regions Aériennes). However, these plans never came to fruition and only the 1st Air Region (French: 1ér Region Aérienne) had been established by 1973, which encompassed nearly the entire Cambodian territory and was concurrently headed by the Air Force Commander.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 217; 224, note 3. The RVNAF flew numerous combat missions inside Cambodia since March in support of joint FANK/Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) ground operations, and to better coordinate its own missions they established at Pochentong a liaison office, the Direct Air Support Centre (DASC) Zulu. In addition, South Vietnamese O-1D Bird Dog Forward air controllers began regularly staging reconnaissance flights from Pochentong to guide RVNAF airstrikes and artillery fire. An initial expansion of the AVNK inventory in September 1970 under American auspices was accomplished with the delivery of six UH-1 Iroquois helicopter gunships with temporary South Vietnamese crews.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 19-20. The RVNAF assigned a 49-man contingent of pilots and ground technicians to Pochentong to help fly and maintain these airframes until AVNK personnel had completed their instruction cycle manned by US advisors in South Vietnam. To ease maintenance, it was decided upon American suggestion to build the AVNK's strike component around the T-28D Trojan, since both its pilots and ground technicians were already well-acquainted with this aircraft type, and the Americans had plenty of surplus airframes and spare parts available. As a result, the rate of T-28D sorties increased, with 2,016 sorties being recorded between March and October 1970, in contrast to the 360 sorties of the MiG-17F and Shenyang fighter jets, and the 108 strikes of the Fouga Magister jets registed during that same period.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 217. The Pochentong raid On the night of 21–22 January 1971, a hundred or so-strong PAVN \\"Sapper\\" (Vietnamese: Đắc Cộng) Commando force managed to pass undetected through the defensive perimeter of the Special Military Region (French: Région Militaire Speciale – RMS) set by the Cambodian Army around Phnom Penh and carried out a spectacular raid on Pochentong airbase. Broken into six smaller detachments armed mostly with AK-47 assault rifles and RPG-7 anti-tank rocket launchers, the PAVN raiders succeeded in scaling the barbed-wire fence and quickly overwhelmed the poorly armed airmen of the Security Battalion on duty that night. Once inside the facility, the raiders unleashed a furious barrage of small-arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades against any aircraft they found on the parking area adjacent to the runway and nearby buildings; one of the commando teams even scaled the adjoining commercial terminal of the civilian airport and after taking position at the international restaurant located on the roof, they fired a rocket into the napalm supply depot near the RVNAF apron. When the smoke cleared the next morning, the Khmer National Aviation had been virtually annihilated. A total of 69 aircraft stationed at Pochentong at the time were either completely destroyed or severely damaged on the ground, including many T-28D Trojans, nearly all the Shenyang, MiG, T-37B and Fouga Magister jets, all the L-19A Bird Dogs and An-2 transports, the UH-1 helicopter gunships, three VNAF O-1 Bird Dogs and even a VIP transport recently presented to President Lon Nol by the South Vietnamese government. Apart from the aircraft losses, 39 AVNK officers and enlisted men had lost their lives and another 170 were injured. The only airframes that escaped destruction were six T-28D Trojans temporarily deployed to Battambang, ten GY-80 Horizon light trainers (also stationed at Battambang), eight Alouette II and Alouette III helicopters, two Sikorsky H-34 helicopters, one T-37B jet trainer, and a single Fouga Magister jet that had been grounded for repairs. Pochentong airbase was closed for almost a week while the damage was assessed, wreckage removed, the runway repaired, and the stocks of fuel and ammunitions replenished.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 53.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 217-218; 226.Serra, L'armée nord-vietnamienne, 1954-1975 (2e partie) (2012), p. 38. Reorganization 1971-72 Helio AU-24A Stallion in storage at Davis-Monthan AFB, July 1972, prior to its delivery to the Khmer Air Force. The Cambodian Air Force was reborn on June 8, 1971, when it was made a separated command from the Army and thus became the third independent branch of the FANK. This new status was later confirmed on December 15, when the AVNK officially changed its name to Khmer Air Force (French: Armée de l'air khmère; AAK), or KAF. Promoted to Colonel, So Satto remained at the helm of the new Khmer Air Force and immediately began implementing an expansion programme. To better coordinate USAF and RVNAF air support, the KAF Command established that same month at Pochentong a Air Operations Centre – AOC (French: Centre des opérations aériennes – COA) headed by Lt. Col. Norodom Baley, who had previously attended a tactical air course in West Germany during the early 1960s.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 220; 224, note 14. Starting from scratch, the KAF received a new influx of US-made aircraft under the auspices of the American Military Equipment Delivery Team, Cambodia (MEDTC) assistance program. Among the most effective additions were two Douglas AC-47D Spooky gunships turned over to Cambodia in June 1971, which were initially used for night surveillance and defense operations at Pochentong Airbase, in order to deter further PAVN sapper attacks.Davis and Greer, Gunships, A Pictorial History of Spooky (1982), pp. 13–14.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 217-218. Nationalist Chinese advisors and engineers from Taiwan also assisted the KAF ground technicians at Pochentong in the rebuilding of former AVNK airframes damaged in the January raid, enabling some transport planes and helicopters to be repaired and returned quickly to flying condition. By the end of the year, the KAF's inventory now included sixteen T-28D fighter- bombers, twenty-four Cessna O-1D reconnaissance/observation light aircraft,Wheeler, Flight International 15 August 1974, p. 171. nineteen C-47 transports, five U-17 light utility aircraft, nine Cessna T-41D Mescalero trainers, eleven Bell UH-1D transports,Gunston, An Illustrated Guide to Military Helicopters (1981), p. 18. sixteen U-1A Otter liaison aircraft, three AC-47D Spooky gunships, and one EC-47D SIGINT aircraft. Col. So Satto also requested from the United States Northrop F-5A light fighters to replace the destroyed Shenyang, MiG and Fouga jets, but the US government turned down the request and offered in alternative some North American F-86F Sabrejets on the verge of retirement from the RTAF. However, an inspection made by a team of Cambodian technicians sent to Thailand revealed that the airframes were no longer in flyable condition, so the KAF Command rejected the proposal altogether. Unable to acquire new fighter jets, the KAF was left without air- to-air capacity for the remainder of the war. An additional offer of some Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar transports which had previously seen service with the RVNAF was equally turned down by the Cambodians. The Australians delivered in January 1972 six silvered C-47 transports for training purposes, which were posted to the KAF Air Academy in Battambang. In 1972 KAF expansion slowed slightly as organisational difficulties were encountered. The Tactical Air Group was therefore re-organized into five squadrons created from the existing flight groups – the T-28D fighter-bombers under the 1st Fighter Squadron (French: 1ér Escadron de Combat); the EC-47D, the C-47 transports and AC-47D gunships under the 1st Transport Squadron (French: 1ér Escadron de Transport); the O-1D reconnaissance/observation light aircraft, the U-17 light utility aircraft and U-1A liaison aircraft under the Forward Air Controller Squadron (French: Escadron d'Observation et d'Accompagnement au Combat); the UH-1D, H-34 and Alouette helicopters under the Helicopter Squadron (French: Escadron d'Hélicoptères); and the silvered C-47 trainers, the T-41D trainers and the GY-80 light trainers under the Advanced Training Squadron (French: Escadron d'Entrainement Avancée). With the exception of the training squadron, which was stationed permanently at the Air Force Academy in Battambang, the other four squadrons were based at Pochentong Airbase. Inherited from the defunct AVNK, the KAF's administrative, support and technical branches remained untouched by this reorganization and retained their separate structure under the Territorial and Technical Group commands. New airbases were laid down near the provincial capitals of Battambang, Kampong Cham and Kampong Chhnang, and near the Khmer National Navy's (French: Marine Nationale Khmère – MNK) Ream Naval Base.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 217; 224, note 4. Later in the war, secondary airfields and assorted helipads were temporally set up at Kampot, Oudong, Kampong Thom, and Stung Mean Chey near Phnom Penh.Sutsakhan, The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse (1980), p. 165. Chinese instructor pilots from Taiwan were posted on loan at the KAF Battambang Air Academy to train its pilots whereas Khmer cadets and air crews were sent for L-19, 0-1, UH-1, T-28, AC-47, EC-47, AU-24, and C-123 training to South Vietnam, Thailand, and the United States. Most of the advanced courses and specialized training of Khmer combat pilots was conducted by Thai instructors at the RTAF Kampheng Sen Flight Training School in Nakhon Pathom Province and by American advisors of Detachment 1, 56th Special Operations Wing at Udorn, U-Tapao and Takhli airbases in Thailand, while others were dispatched to attend observer courses at Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam. A small number also went to train with the US Navy at the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida and attended courses at the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) East Sale Airbase in Victoria, Australia. In the mist of this reorganisation, the Khmer Air Force's own inventory continued to expand via the MEDTC during the following year. Under the Foreign Military Sales program between January and November 1972, the KAF took delivery of fourteen AU-24A Stallion mini- gunships,https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/au-24.htm fifteen T-28D fighter-bombers, four AC-47D gunships, nineteen UH-1H helicopters, sixteen T-28B unarmed trainers in poor condition, and another four T-41D trainers. An important addition to the KAF, the AU-24A mini- gunships were assigned to a newly-raised Mini-gunship Squadron (French: Escadron AU-24) stationed at Pochentong, which broadened supply convoy escort operations on the lower Mekong-Bassac corridors. Such operations had been carried out in conjunction with the MNK since mid-1971, when the KAF began to provide air cover to MNK convoys with their AC-47D gunships.Davis and Greer, Gunships, A Pictorial History of Spooky (1982), pp. 63-64.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 20-21. Despite the slow improvements delivered by Brigadier general So Satto's expansion programme, the KAF's own combat capabilities remained low and because of plentiful US air support – used excessively by the Cambodian Army – was relegated to a minor role only. Expansion 1973-74 This situation began to change in March 1973, when the Khmer Air Force suffered a setback after a pro-Sihanouk T-28D fighter-bomber pilot bombed the presidential palace and deserted. After ordering a complete stand-down of the KAF for three days, President Lon Nol dismissed Brig. Gen. So Satto and replaced him by his deputy, Col. Penn Randa (promptly promoted to Brigadier general), who immediately began to enforce new programmes to improve the KAF. The most important of these plans was the establishment of a KAF Direct Air Support Centre – DASC (French: Centre de soutien aérien direct – CSAD). Co-located at the FANK Combined Operations Centre – COC (French: Centre d'opérations combinées), the DASC was given responsibility for gathering current targeting information from US aircraft and Cambodian Army units in the field, and passing on to the KAF. However, this new concept was resisted by the commander of the KAF Air Operations Centre – who was unwilling to turn over responsibility to the newly-created DASC –, by continuing to feed the KAF with pre-planned strike co-ordinates. In practice, the Cambodian Army Command had little faith in the ability of the KAF's inexperienced forward air controllers to accurately spot targets and direct close air support, leaving the DASC to function primarily as a relay between the Army Headquarters in Phnom Penh and US aircraft.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 220. In May 1973, the KAF received five of an eventual eight Fairchild C-123K Provider transports on paper, which were employed extensively alongside the C-47 transports of the 1st Transport Squadron on air-drop resupply operations. That same month, under an accelerated delivery programme named Project Nimble Voyage, the Americans gave the KAF ten UH-1G helicopter gunships, which were assigned to the Helicopter Squadron. Five of the machines were deployed to Battambang Airbase and the other five helicopters were stationed at Pochentong, being used extensively alongside the AC-47D and AU-24A gunships in the Mekong-Bassac convoy support role.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 43. Under Project Flycatcher, an improvement programme for the KAF, the Americans delivered twelve T-28D Trojans, six UH-1H helicopters, five C-123K Providers and a smaller number of C-47 transports and O-1D Bird Dogs, later followed by a single AU-24A mini-gunship and twenty-four Cessna T-37B Tweet jet trainers before the programme was officially terminated on June 30, 1973. This was to be the last official US delivery of aircraft to Cambodia (though secret deliveries of a small number of T-28D aircraft continued under the auspices of the CIA until January 1975), which nevertheless significantly improved the combat capability of the KAF.Jan Forsgren, Cambodia: Khmer Air Force History 1970-1975 (Part 2) - http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/aa-eastasia/cambodia/cam- af-history2.htmChinnery, The age of austerity in Vietnam, the air war over south-east Asia (2016), p. 92. At the same time, the KAF Command continued to expand co-ordination with the Cambodian Army, despite an initial reluctance on the part of Army field commanders, who remained sceptical of their Air Force's capabilities. An Air-Ground Operations School – AGOS (French: École des opérations air-sol – EOAS) was opened in May to train forward air guides (FAGs) from the Army and in July, the KAF began providing forward air controllers to the Army's new Artillery Fire Co-ordination Centre – AFCC (French: Centre de coordination des tirs d'artillerie – CCTA) that would relay targets from Army field commanders on the ground to the DASC. On August 15, 1973, a ceasefire came into effect in Indochina and US tactical and strategic air support was terminated, with the Khmer Air Force assuming full responsibility for all air operations in Cambodia. With the Khmer Rouge guerrillas controlling large parts of the countryside, the Khmer National Armed Forces were fighting an up-hill battle. The KAF suffered a severe blow later in November 1973 when a second renegade T-28D pilot once more bombed the presidential palace and deserted. As with the earlier March incident, President Lon Nol ordered a bombing stand-down and relieved Brig. Gen. Penn Randa from its command. A new Air Force commander, Col. Ea Chhong, was promoted and immediately began to improve the performance of the KAF.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 220-221. In an effort to further boost the KAF's capabilities, the Americans initiated three assistance programmes. The first one, Operation Rotorhead Express, started in June 1974 when a US Army team arrived at Pochentong to give a one- time repair to the KAF UH-1 helicopter fleet. This was followed in January 1975 by Operation Flycatcher (not to be confused with the earlier namesake US aircraft delivery programme), a similar USAF effort directed at the KAF's T-28D fighter-bombers carried out by a USAF team also at Pochentong. That same month, a USAF Mobile Training Team began in Thailand a training programme intended to make the KAF airlift wing self-sufficient.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 222. Late war organization 1974-75 By January 1975 KAF's strength had peaked to 10,000 Officers and airmen (including airwomen) under the command of Brig. Gen. Ea Chhong, equipped with a total inventory of 211 aircraft of several types distributed amongst the Tactical Air Group squadrons as follows: *The 1st Fighter Squadron aligned sixty-four T-28D Trojan fighter-bombers.Taylor and Munson, Jane's Pocket Book of Major Combat Aircraft (1973), p. 179.Krivinyi, World Military Aviation (1977), p. 178.Fitzsimons, The Defenders: A Comprehensive Guide to Warplanes of the USA (1988), p. 137. *The Mini-gunship Squadron had fourteen AU-24A Stallion mini-gunships. *The Forward Air Controller Squadron operated forty-five Cessna O-1D Bird Dog reconnaissance/observation light aircraft, sixteen U-1A Otter liaison aircraft and five U-17 light utility aircraft. *The 1st Transport Squadron aligned seventeen Fairchild C-123K Provider transports, twenty-three Douglas C-47 Skytrain transports, fourteen Douglas AC-47D Spooky gunships,Davis and Greer, Gunships, A Pictorial History of Spooky (1982), pp. 13-14. and one EC-47D SIGINT aircraft. *The Helicopter Squadron had ten Bell UH-1G gunships, forty- six Bell UH-1D/H transports, three Sud Aviation SA 316B Alouette III light helicopters, and two Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw utility transports. *The Advanced Training Squadron of the Air Force Academy at Battambang Airbase operated six silvered C-47 trainers, sixteen T-28B light trainers, ten Gardan GY-80 Horizon light trainers, twenty-two Cessna T-41D Mescalero trainers, and twenty-four Cessna T-37B Tweet jet trainers.Sutsakhan, The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse (1980), p. 183, Appendix C (Air Force Item). Air Force Security Regiments Following several attacks on Cambodian airfields early in the war, the KAF Security troops underwent a major reorganization by mid-1971. The battered BFA at Pochentong was expanded accordingly from a single rifle battalion of three companies, to a full security regiment aligning three battalions, receiving the designation of 1st Air Fusiliers Regiment (French: 1er Regiment de Fusiliers de l'Air – 1 RFA). Between July 1971 and December 1972, Air Force battalions were rotated through intensive infantry training courses manned by the US Army-Vietnam Individual Training Program (UITG) in South Vietnam to upgrade their combat capabilities, with selected airmen receiving some specialized training as well – by early 1973, 1 RFA aligned two rifle battalions plus one specialized battalion trained for search-and-rescue (SAR) missions, crash-site recovery and VIP protection. The KAF Security command under Colonel Sou Chhorn was augmented in 1974 when a second unit was brought to strength at Kampong Cham Airbase, which became the 2nd Air Fusiliers Regiment (French: 2éme Regiment de Fusiliers de l'Air – 2 RFA).Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 218; 224, note 9. 2 RFA battalions were trained in-country by the Khmer Special Forces at the Ream Infantry Training Centre near Kampong Som.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), p. 15. By April 1975, KAF Security troops totalled some 1,600 airmen organized in six light infantry battalions, equipped with an assortment of outdated and modern US and captured Soviet or Chinese small-arms.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 18. == Facilities == {  ! style=\\"text-align: left; background: #aabccc;\\"Base ! style=\\"text-align: left; background: #aabccc;\\"Operator ! style=\\"text-align: left; background: #aabccc;\\"Description - -  Pochentong International Airport  Khmer Air Force/Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF)/U.S. Air Force  Built by the French in the 1950s and 1960s, is a dual-use airport, civilian and military, the primary hub for international civilian flights.

Its MiG, Shenyang and Fouga jets bombed and strafed PAVN/VC troop concentrations and sanctuaries along the Takéo, Kandal, Svay Rieng, Mondulkiri and Ratanakiri southern and eastern border provinces, while the T-28D Trojans and a few AD-4N Skyraiders were employed on combat sorties north of Phnom Penh and in Kampong Cham Province. *During Operation Chenla II, launched by the FANK High Command on August 21, 1971, the Khmer Air Force's T-28D fighter-bombers and C-47 transports supported with air strikes and air ressuply drops the advance of the Cambodian Army task-force sent to retake all of Route 6 and the road between Kampong Cham and Kampong Thom from the PAVN. KAF helicopters carried Cambodian troops into the targeted areas and later helped evacuate the task-force units, disorganized and cut-off by a vigorous PAVN counter-offensive held in late October.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 7. *On October 7, 1972, the PAVN hit Phnom Penh once again with a spectacular sapper attack, in which a commando force of 103 men from the 367th Sapper Regiment raided the Cambodian Army armoured cavalry headquarters located at the Olympic Stadium in the northern outskirts of the City.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 37.Conboy and McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces (1991), pp. 53-54.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 194.Serra, L'armée nord-vietnamienne, 1954–1975 (2e partie) (2012), p. 38. The PAVN raiders even managed to capture seven M113 armored personnel carriers and drove them out in column into the capital's streets, causing panic among the inhabitants. Initially taken by surprise, Cambodian Army troops took several hours to dominate the situation, and urgent air support was requested. The Khmer Air Force response came in the form of two AC-47D gunships whose firepower succeeded in disabling all the vehicles, thus stopping the column before it could reach the city's centre, killing in the process 83 members of the sapper force and scattered the rest.Conboy, Bowra, and McCouaig, The NVA and Viet Cong (1992), pp. 12-13.Grandolini, Armor of the Vietnam War (2): Asian Forces (1998), pp. 65-66. *During the Battle of Kampong Cham in September 1973, the KAF provided close air support to Operation \\"Castor 21\\", the combined Cambodian Army-Khmer National Navy (MNK) amphibious assault to retake the enemy-held half of the provincial capital of Kampong Cham, which had been stormed by Khmer Rouge forces earlier in August. In coordination with Khmer Special Forces teams on the ground, the KAF's C-47 and C-123K transports also carried out successfully aerial resupply drops on behalf of Cambodian Army units defending the retaken city.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 44. *In October of that same year, the KAF went on to the offensive again with Operation \\"Thunderstrike\\", a nine-day' ground assault operation in support of Cambodian Army units fighting Khmer Rouge forces south of the Prek Thnoat River. Striking in that area located south of Phnom Penh between Route 2 and Route 3, T-28D fighter-bomber pilots logged a record of seventy sorties a day. Although both the 1st and 3rd Infantry Divisions were already thrown on the defensive and failed to capitalize on \\"Thunderstrike\\" by making no significant advances,Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 152. the FANK High Command was nonetheless impressed by their Air Force improved performance. *The Khmer Air Force scored a major hit in March 1974, when a flight of ten T-28D fighter-bombers guided by a single Cessna O-1D FAC spotter struck the main PAVN transhipment point at Dambe, Kratié Province, where some 250 supply trucks laden with ammunitions lay in a truck park hidden on a rubber plantation. After the KAF T-28D pilots dropped their 250 lb bombs over the plantation, they unexpectedly ignited a violent chain reaction which – based on the analysis of post-strike aerial reconnaissance photos – destroyed at least 125 trucks, a record for the Second Indochina War.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 21.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 221. *That same month, during the MNK's second large-scale amphibious assault, Operation \\"Castor 50\\", the KAF provided again close air support and air resupply drops to Cambodian Army troops fighting to retake both Oudong, the capital of Oudong Meanchey Province and Kampot, the capital of Kampot Province from the Khmer Rouge.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), pp. 9; 24.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), p. 242. *Later on June–July of that year, during the siege of the district capital of Kampong Seila in Koh Kong Province, located some 135 Km (84 Mi) south-west of Phnom Penh, down Route 4, after two unsuccessful attempts, the KAF heli-lifted a Khmer Special Forces team to help coordinate aerial resupply operations by their C-47 and C-123K transports to alleviate the starvation suffered by the local civilian population after their town was besieged during a record eight-month-long period by Khmer Rouge forces.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 9. Operational hazards Although regarded by most outside observers as the most professional branch of the Cambodian armed forces, the Khmer Air Force was seriously handicapped throughout its existence by several key problems that stood in the way of its efficiency. Being an all-volunteer, technically-proficient service, the KAF was long plagued by shortages of skilled pilots, experienced pilot instructors, and support personnel, coupled by the inconsistent quality of forward air controllers, pilot fatigue, inadequate training, lack of effective leadership – exacerbated by constant changes in command – and its inability to organize itself. Other chronic problems included an unfocused inventory (at least, during the early stages of the war), inadequate maintenance of airframes, unsuitable airfields, and an insufficient night support capability. As with the Cambodian Army, the KAF faced severe budgetary restraints after US financial aid was slashed in 1973 and was riven by corruption – most of its transport aircraft regularly experienced landing gear problems since the aircrews often tended to accept paid transportation services, overloading their planes with unauthorized civilian passengers and cargo.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 12. Training accidents remained a serious problem: in 1972-73 the morale of the Khmer Air Force pilots was strained by a series of crashes involving the T-28D Trojan, the T-41D Mescalero, and the AU-24A Stallion. Confidence in the T-28D eroded after fourteen crashes were recorded during a twelve-month period, even though eight of the crashes were due to pilot error, three to enemy anti-aircraft ground fire and only three to mechanical failure. Four T-41D trainers were also lost in separate incidents during July 1972, all pilots being killed.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 20.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 219. The AU-24A was beset with a long list of technical faults, which became painfully clear on August 10, 1973, after a Stallion crashed on a rocket pass, killing its crew and forced the KAF Command to ground temporarily the entire mini- gunship fleet. Besides accidental crashes, three U-1A Otters were destroyed on the ground at Pochentong by a Khmer Rouge mortar attack on March 1972 and later in August that year KAF Lt. Col. Long Trasom, the commander of the helicopter squadron, was killed when his UH-1H helicopter was shot down by a SA-7 Grail surface-to-air missile near Svay Rieng, the capital of Svay Rieng Province.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 219; 224, note 12. Another problem that plagued the KAF was political dissent amongst its ranks. The 1st Fighter Squadron was regarded with deep distrust by both the FANK High Command and the Republican government, after some dissident pilots from that squadron tried unsuccessfully to assassinate top military and political officials (including President Lon Nol) on at least three separate occasions: *On March 17, 1973, a disgruntled pro-Sihanouk KAF pilot, Capt. So Patra, flew his T-28D fighter- bomber into downtown Phnom Penh and made a sudden dive-bomb attack over the Presidential Palace at the Chamkarmon District. A total of 43 people were killed and another 35 injured in the bombing, after which the pilot flew to Hainan Island in the South China Sea. This incident led to the dismissal of Brig. Gen. So Satto. *On November 19, 1973, the Presidential Palace was struck yet again by another dissident pilot, Lt. Pich Lim Khun, who subsequently deserted by flying its T-28D to Khmer Rouge-held Kratié Province. As a result of this second air strike, President Lon Nol purged the KAF of who were considered to be disloyal elements, which included Lieutenant colonels Norodom Baley and Norodom Vatvani, Major Dimang Rothary and Captain Oung Siphoun, and forced the resignation of Brig. Gen. Penn Randa. *On April 14, 1975, for the third time in the war, a defecting Cambodian pilot attempted an aerial assassination of the nation's chief executive. That morning, a T-28D fighter- bomber flown by Lt. Kiev Yoursawath, dropped four 250 lb bombs over the FANK Joint General Staff Headquarters (French: État-Major Générale – EMG). Two landed about 60 ft (about 19 m) from where Lieutenant general Sak Sutsakhan was chairing a cabinet meeting. Although the officials managed to escape unscathed, the bombs claimed the lives of seven people and several others were injured.http://www.mail-archive.com/camdisc@googlegroups.com/msg09009.html The pilot then headed north and landed in one of the Khmer Rouge-controlled portions of Kampong Cham province. The Khmer Air Force saw its aerial resupply capability severely curtailed late in the war, when on March 13, 1975, the Khmer Rouge hit Pochentong Airbase with 107mm rockets, which ignited an ammunition dump and destroyed a nearby storehouse used to pack and store air- drop cargo parachutes employed on resupply operations. The loss of their cargo parachute stocks deprived the KAF's C-47 and C-123K transports of the means to adequately support the isolated enclaves still held by Cambodian Army units, so the US government had to hire civilian contractors in order to carry out most of the outpost resupply drops within Cambodia. Final operations 1974-1975 It was only in the final months of the war that the Khmer Air Force finally managed to exceed all previous performances. Taking full advantage of their air superiority, the KAF employed all available airframes to the limit – ranging from T-28D fighter-bombers, UH-1G helicopter gunships, and AC-47D and AU-24A gunships to T-37B jet trainers converted to the ground attack role, and even C-123K transports serving as makeshift heavy bombers – launched an unprecedented number of combat sorties against Khmer Rouge forces massing around Phnom Penh. Operating against relatively light enemy anti- aircraft defences, Cambodian T-28D pilots logged over 1,800 daytime missions during a two-month period alone whilst the AU-24A mini-gunships and C-123K transports carried out at night bombing operations against entrenched enemy 107mm rocket positions north of the capital.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 22. To help locate these same positions and set up ambushes, detachments from the KAF's 1 RFA security battalions were heli- lifted behind the enemy lines, but they were decimated by insurgent troops. Besides combat sorties, the KAF was also involved in last-minute evacuation efforts. On April 12, 1975, its T-28D fighter-bombers and UH-1 Helicopters provided air cover to Operation Eagle Pull, the evacuation of the US Embassy staff. Most of the T-28D pilots involved in this operation were forced to land their planes in the main road leading to Pochentong's civilian airport and adjacent to the military airbase, since the latter's airstrip was under heavy artillery fire. The Air Force command also kept on stand-by seven UH-1H transport helicopters at an improvised helipad mounted on the grounds of the Phnom Penh Olympic Stadium in the Cércle Sportive complex, ready to evacuate key members of the government. However, three of the machines had to be abandoned due to technical malfunctions when the evacuation finally took place on the morning of April 17.Sutsakhan, The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse (1980), p. 169. Amongst the small group of high-profile evacuees who boarded the remaining four helicopters heading for Kampong Thom was the KAF commander Brig. Gen. Ea Chhong.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 223. Despite their best efforts, the overstretched Khmer Air Force alone could not prevent the defeat of the Cambodian Army and stem the tide of the advancing Khmer Rouge forces. On April 16 KAF T-28D Trojans flew their last combat sortie by bombing the Air Force Control Centre and hangars at Pochentong upon its capture by insurgent units. After virtually expending their entire ordnance reserves, 97 aircraft – consisting of fifty T-28D fighter-bombers, thirteen UH-1D/H transports, twelve O-1D Bird Dogs, ten C-123K transports, seven AC-47D gunships, three AU-24A mini-gunships, nine C-47 transports, and three T-41D trainers – escaped from Pochentong, Battambang, Kampong Cham, Kampong Thom, Kampong Chhnang and Ream airbases and auxiliary airfields flown by their respective crews (with a small number of civilian dependents on board) to safe haven in neighbouring Thailand. The rest of the KAF personnel that remained in Cambodia – including the male and female clerical staff, the ground technicians, some pilots, and those airmen serving on the 1st Air Fusiliers Regiment at Pochentong – had no choice but to surrender, with most of them being executed by the Khmer Rouge. The last stand of the Khmer Air Force took place at Kampong Cham Airbase, where the airmen of the 2nd Air Fusiliers Regiment continued to resist for another week despite the official capitulation order, until they ran out of ammunition. The airbase commander, together with his deputy, the local ground technicians and the airmen of the Security battalions were captured and reportedly executed in a gruesome manner. Later unconfirmed reports claim that a few qualified ex-KAF pilots and technicians escaped this fate by being pressed into service in the Air Force of the Kampuchea Liberation Army (AFKLA) of the new Democratic Kampuchea Regime to fly and maintain the remaining French- and US-made aircraft left behind. ==Aftermath== By 1975, Khmer Air Force losses totalled 100 aircraft, mostly due to combat attrition, training accidents, and desertions, as well for other causes – between December 1971 and January 1972 four Alouette II and one Alouette III light helicopters were sent overseas for maintenance and general overhaul at the HAECO in Hong Kong, but there is no record that these airframes were ever returned to Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge did managed though to salvage at least twenty-two T-28D fighter-bombers, four GY-80 Horizon light trainers, twenty-four T-37B jet trainers, nineteen T-41D trainers, five U-17 light utility aircraft, seven C-123K transports, nine AU-24A mini-gunships, six AC-47D gunships, fourteen C-47 transports, twenty UH-1D/H and UH-1G helicopters, and three Alouette III light helicopters. Of the twelve T-28D Trojans operated by the Khmer Rouge's AFKLA at Ream Airbase, at least five were destroyed on the ground when the USAF bombed the facility during the Mayaguez incident on May 15, 1975.http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/aa-eastasia/cambodia/cam-af1-aircraft.htm As for the other airframes, poor maintenance and a chronic shortage of spare parts ensured that only a handful of these was still airworthy when the AFKLA was neutralized by the PAVN in February 1979 during the Cambodian–Vietnamese War. ==List of Cambodian Aviation and Air Force commanders== *Major general Ngo Hou (1954–1968) *Colonel Keu Pau Ann (1968–1970) *Brigadier general So Satto (1970–73) *Brigadier general Penn Randa (1973) *Brigadier general Ea Chhong (1973–75) ==Air Force uniforms and insignia== The Cambodian Air Force owed its origin and traditions to the French Far East Airforces (French: Forces Aériennes en Extrême-Orient – FAEO) of the First Indochina War, and even after the United States took the role as the main foreign sponsor for the Khmer National Armed Forces at the beginning of the 1970s, French military influence was still perceptible in their uniforms and insignia. Service dress uniforms Upon its formation in 1954, AVRK personnel received the French Army's M1945 tropical working and service dress (French: Tenue de toile kaki clair Mle 1945), standard issue in the ARK, consisting of a light khaki cotton shirt and pants. Modelled after the WWII US Army tropical \\"Chino\\" working dress, the shirt had two patch breast pockets closed by clip-cornered straight flaps and shoulder straps whilst the trousers featured two pleats at the front hips, side slashed pockets and an internal pocket at the back, on the right side. In alternative, the short-sleeved M1946 (French: Chemisette kaki clair Mle 1946) – which had two pleated patch breast pockets closed by pointed flaps – and the \\"Chino\\"-style M1949 (French: Chemisette kaki clair Mle 1949) khaki shirts could be worn with the matching M1946 khaki shorts (French: Culotte courte kaki clair Mle 1946) in hot weather. AVRK officers and pilots were given the standard FARK summer service dress uniform in light khaki cotton, which was patterned after the French Army M1946/56 khaki dress uniform (French: Vareuse d'officier Mle 1946/56 et Pantalon droit Mle 1946/56); for formal occasions, a light summer version in white cotton was also issued.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 225. The open-collar jacket had two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps and two unpleated at the side closed by straight ones whilst the sleeves had false turnbacks; the front fly and pocket flaps were secured by gilt buttons. The uniform was worn with a matching Khaki shirt and black tie on service dress whereas the white version was worn with a white shirt and a black tie instead. Some AVRK officers also wore a light Khaki British-style, long-sleeved KD bush jacket which had two pleated breast pockets closed by scalloped flaps and two unpleated at the side closed by straight ones, a five- button front fly, shoulder straps, and an integral cloth waistband. In 1955-56, AVRK officers adopted a new distinctive blue-grey overseas dress uniform, consisting of a tunic and slacks modelled after the U.S. Air Force M1947 service dress. On active service, the blue dress uniform was worn with a light blue shirt and blue-grey tie, replaced on formal occasions by a white shirt and black tie. The American-style open-collar, four-buttoned tunic had two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps and two unpleated pockets at the side closed by straight flaps (senior officers' tunics sometimes had their side pockets closed by pointed flaps instead). The front fly and pocket flaps were secured by gilt buttons bearing the standard FARK emblem, replaced after March 1970 by the FANK emblem; a short-sleeved light blue shirt was worn in lieu of the tunic on hot weather. A light blue-grey working uniform, consisting of a shirt and pants whose cut followed that of the earlier M1945 tropical dress, was also adopted for all-ranksConboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 22. though AVRK ground personnel in the field often wore the standard ARK French all-arms M1947 drab green fatigues (French: Treillis de combat Mle 1947). Female personnel were issued light blue and working blue-grey short-sleeved blouses based on their male counterparts' versions, except that the blouses' front fly closed on the left side, and were worn with a matching blue-grey knee-length skirt.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 248. After March 1970, as part of the US-sponsored MAP re-equipment program, the AVNK was supplied with new American olive green tropical uniforms, the US Army OG-107 utilities and the M1967 Jungle Utility Uniform for its ground personnel and airfield security battalions and pilot student cadets (EPKs) attending courses at the Battambang Air Academy, though they never replaced entirely the older French fatigue clothing.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 18. Olive green US M-1951 field jackets were also issued to all-ranks. Pilots were issued Khaki and Olive Green (OG) flight suits, with both French and US patterns being worn. Privately purchased Thai camouflaged flight suits in \\"Highland\\" pattern were worn by Khmer Air Force Douglas AC-47D Spooky gunship aircrews on occasion, such as the members of the first contingent sent in May–June 1971 to Udorn Airbase in Thailand for gunship training.Davis and Greer, Gunships, A Pictorial History of Spooky (1982), p. 14.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 43, Plate E1. A US Air Force survival mesh vest was usually worn with the flight suits after 1970. Headgear AVRK officers received the early ARK service peaked cap in both light khaki and white-topped versions, which was copied after the French M1927 pattern (French: Casquette d’officier Mle 1927) to wear with either the light khaki or white service dress uniforms. The peaked caps were worn with the standard gilt metal FARK cap device bearing the Cambodian Royal Arms. Ground and flight personnel generally wore the standard ARK headgear of the period, which consisted of French M1946 and M1957 light khaki sidecaps (French: Bonnet de police de toile kaki clair Mle 1946 and Bonnet de police de toile kaki clair Mle 1957), M1946 tropical berets (French: Bérét de toile kaki clair Mle 1946), M1949 bush hats (French: Chapeau de brousse Mle 1949) and light khaki cotton baseball cap-style field caps. In 1956, the AVRK adopted a new blue-grey service peaked cap with crown of \\"Germanic\\" shape – very similar to that worn by Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) or Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) officers –, with a gold braid chinstrap, black cap band, and black lacquered leather peak (edged gold for general officers). It was initially worn with the standard gilt metal FARK cap device, replaced after March 1970 by a distinctive AVNK/KAF silver cap badge.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 23.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), p. 231. A blue-grey overseas flight cap (with silver cord piping in the flap for officers) styled after the French M1957 sidecap, was also adopted; after 1970 it was sometimes worn with a miniature cloth embroidered version of the AVNK/KAF cap badge. Besides regulation headgear, unofficial Olive Green and camouflage baseball caps (black or red embroidered versions were adopted by some Cambodian pilots who attended advanced courses abroad)Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 24. and US \\"Boonie hats\\" found their way into the KAF from the United States, Thailand and South Vietnam, to which were soon added Cambodian-made copies. The pilot student cadets and the airmen serving in the airfield security battalions retained as service headgear the old M1946 khaki tropical beret worn with the miniature AVNK/KAF cap badge and the latter were also issued steel helmets, in the form of the US M-1 and the French M1951 NATO (French: Casque modéle 1951 OTAN), standard issue in the ARK/ANK. Footwear White and brown low laced leather shoes were prescribed to wear with either the white summer dress and the earlier AVRK khaki service/work uniform for all-ranks and, after 1956 black ones were required for Air Force officers wearing the new blue-grey officers' dress uniform on formal occasions. On service dress, all Air Force ground personnel wore brown leather US M-1943 Combat Service Boots and French M1953 \\"Rangers\\" (French: Rangers modéle 1953) or French canvas-and-rubber Pataugas tropical boots, and sandals; after March 1970, the KAF standardized on American M-1967 black leather and Jungle boots, and South Vietnamese Bata tropical boots, which replaced much of the older combat footwear. Air Force Ranks The AVRK used the same standard FARK/FANK French-style rank chart as the Army, though differing in some of its nomenclature and in color details. Flag and senior officers’ (French: Officiers généraux, officiers supérieurs et officiers subalternes) ranks were worn on light blue removable shoulder boards (with gold laurel-like leaf embroidery on the outer edge for generals) or shoulder strap slides, both with a miniature royal coat-of-arms featuring a winged crown device on the inner end; NCO and airmen (French: Sous-officiers et aviateurs) ranks were worn on both upper sleeves. On the field uniform, officers' ranks were worn on chest tabs in lieu of the shoulder strap slides; Army-style metal chevrons pinned to the chest were worn by NCOs whilst airmen (French: Hommes de troupe) wore no insignia. After March 1970 the AVNK adopted black shoulder boards and shoulder strap slides with a pair of stylised wings at the inner end, which replaced the earlier royal crest, but the basic rank sequence remained unchanged. In 1972, some KAF officers began wearing on their flight suits or OG jungle fatigues metal pin-on collar rank insignia identical to the pattern adopted that same year by their Army counterparts.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), p. 45, Plate F3. {  - !KAF Ranks !Khmer language !French Air Force ranks !US Air Force ranks !Insignia - Pʊəl too ពលទោ Aviateur de deuxième classe Airman Basic (no insignia) - Pʊəl aek ពលឯក Aviateur de première classe Airman 50px - Niey too នាយទោ Caporal Airman 1st Class 50px - Niey aek នាយឯក Caporal-chef Senior Airman 50px - Pʊəl baal trəy ពលបាលត្រី Sergent Staff Sergeant 50px - Pʊəl baal too ពលបាលទោ Sergent-chef Master Sergeant 50px - Pʊəl baal aek ពលបាលឯក Adjudant Chief Master Sergeant 50px - Prɨn baal too ព្រឹន្ទបាលទោ Adjudant-chef Warrant Officer 50px - Prɨn baal aek ព្រឹន្ទបាលឯក Aspirant Chief Warrant Officer 50px - Aknu trəy អនុត្រី Sous-lieutenant 2nd Lieutenant 50px - Aknu too អនុទោ Lieutenant 1st Lieutenant 50px - Aknu aek អនុឯក Capitaine Captain 50px - Vorak trəy វរត្រី Commandant Major 50px - Vorak too វរទោ Lieutenant-Colonel Lieutenant Colonel 50px - Vorak aek វរឯក Colonel Colonel 50px - Utdɑm trəy ឧត្តមត្រី Général de brigade aérienne Brigadier General 50px } Insignia AVRK personnel wore over the left pocket of their working or fatigue shirts a gold metal badge, consisting of a pair of wings surmounted by a royal crown. After 1970 it was replaced by an AVNK/KAF cloth embroidered badge, featuring a yellow winged Angkor Wat temple motif surmounted by three stars on a blue background. A pilot's qualification badge was created in the mid-1950s, its early design consisting of a simple gold metal circle bearing a stylised Hongsa, a mythical Cambodian swan. This badge was replaced in the 1960s by a more elaborated version that featured a gilt swan inserted on a silvered wreath. Both versions were worn on the left breast of the service dress and working uniforms. KAF airmen sent for training overseas wore on the upper right sleeve of their flight suits and working shirts a Cambodian national emblem with \\"Air Force\\" or \\"Khmer Air Force\\" tab, or a simple rectangular flash based on the design of the Republican flag bearing \\"Khmer Republic\\" inscribed in either French or Khmer script. Fighter- bomber pilots wore on the back of their flight suits a \\"blood-chit\\" patterned after the Cambodian national flag, inscribed with a plea for the bearer to be treated has a Prisoner of war (POW) according to international agreements in Khmer script, with Vietnamese and Chinese translations also included.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970-75 (1989), pp. 23; 44.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 231-232. Blue and subdued nametapes were worn over the right shirt or jacket pocket on field dress and flight suits; plastic nameplates were occasionally worn with the blue-grey overseas service dress and the working uniform. Specialized support services within the Khmer Air Force wore full-colour cloth embroidered, woven or printed round and squared- or shield-shaped insignia on their upper left sleeve, whilst airmen serving in the airfield security battalions were entitled to wear collar tabs featuring two yellow crossed rifles embroidered on a blue cloth background also outlined in yellow. KAF headquarters and airbase insignia went to the upper left sleeve. The placement of squadron insignia varied, with pilots wearing full-colour round, hexagonal, or shield- shaped patches on the upper left sleeve or over the right pocket of their flight suits.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975 (2011), pp. 232-237. == See also == * Air America * Cambodian Civil War * Forward air controllers * Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces * Khmer Republic * Khmer Rouge * Khmer National Armed Forces * Republic of Vietnam Air Force * Royal Cambodian Armed Forces * Royal Cambodian Air Force * Royal Lao Air Force * Operation Eagle Pull * Weapons of the Cambodian Civil War ==NotesReferences== *Albert Grandolini, \\"L'Aviation Royale Khmére: The first 15 years of Cambodian military aviation\\", Air Enthusiast 37, September–December 1988, pp. 39–47. *Elizabeth Becker, When the War was over Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution, Simon & Schuster, New York 1988. *Kenneth Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970-1975, Equinox Publishing (Asia) Pte Ltd, Djakarta 2011. *Kenneth Conboy, Kenneth Bowra, and Mike Chappell, The War in Cambodia 1970-75, Men-at-arms series 209, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1989. *Kenneth Conboy, Kenneth Bowra, and Simon McCouaig, The NVA and Viet Cong, Elite series 38, Osprey Publishing Ltd, Oxford 1992. *Kenneth Conboy and Simon McCouaig, South-East Asian Special Forces, Elite series 33, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1991. *Russell R.

The Danish source articles name him as Lorentz. Henrik Fisker accompanied his father on many voyages to the Levant, gaining so much experience that, at the age of only nine years, he was listed as a volunteer cadet and at 14 years old (in 1767) was already a junior lieutenant. In 1761 Lorentz had been on board the Grønland, captained by his father, on a voyage to the Mediterranean whose main purpose was to deliver members of the Royal Danish Scientific Expedition to Arabia Felix (modern day Yemen) to Constantinople. As the Grønland was passing Malta, young Lorentz fell ill and his father left him on the island in the care of some nuns. On the ship’s return Lorentz had recovered and came back on board. Thirty-five years later, in 1796, when Lorentz Fisker was himself a captain, namely of the frigate Thetis, he had a tour of duty in the Mediterranean and visited Malta on many occasions. One of the nuns who had nursed him back to health was by now the Abbess, and she had delivered to the Thetis each day a silver tray of magnificent cakes. The source for this story appears to be letters written by Fisker in 1796 to his wife, as recorded in Thiele’s Thorvaldsens Ungdomshistorie (1851) ;1770–71 Fisker served on the ship-of-the-line Sophie Magdalene under the Admiral Frederik Christian Kaas off Algiers. ==American War of Independence== ;1778 He went into the French naval service on the staff of Admiral Grasses, and later was second-in-command of a number of French frigates. ;1779–1782 Fisker was present at the capture by the French of the British island of Grenada and the naval battles that followed. In the ship-of-the-line Le Dauphin Royal under Guichon’s command he had three encounters with the British admiral Rodney, and later at the investment of Yorktown where General Cornwallis surrendered with 6000 men. Amongst several other fights, where he took part in the capture of two British corvettes, he also survived the battle on 12 April 1782 near Dominique where Rodney defeated Grasse. Awarded the French Order “pour le merite militaire” Fisker’s contributions were acknowledged by the French foreign office. He was recalled after peace was declared in 1783.During this time Fisker was promoted, by the Danish Admiralty, to the rank of commander but as the orders issued in February 1780 were not received until November 1781 (!!) Fisker lost seniority to Otto Lütken, which gave rise to some ill-feeling. ==In Home Waters== ;1783–1796 Fisker had a busy period during which he was part ship's captain, part surveyor and map maker of the Danish and Norwegian coasts.In 1786 orders were issued to Lorentz Fisker to investigate all the inlets, fjords, coves and bays on the southern Norwegian coast between Frederickshald and Lindesnæs, and in 1787 similarly to chart the Kattegat and Great Belt. In 1788 he was second in command of the royal yacht Hvide Ørn when the crown prince visited Norway. and later that year was appointed as adjutant to the Russian Admiral Von Dessen, who was in command of a joint Russian-Danish squadron. In this position he came to take a major part in the inquiry into the Benzelsterna case Lars Benzelsterna was a Swedish naval officer who planned (unsuccessfully) to burn the Russian fleet while it was frozen in at Copenhagen. Lorentz Fisker arrested Benzelsterna as the latter was trying to escape disguised as a coachman. In 1789 he was promoted to captain, and in the same year he married Charlotte Amalie Kofoed, daughter of the Director of the Post Office and of the Prison Service. As captain of various ships, Fisker served in the Danish home fleet, including the ship-of-the-line Ditmarsk, and the frigate Fredericksværn in 1792 when this was a cadet training ship. In 1795 he travelled extensively in Jutland and the duchies of Schleswig and HolsteinThe Danish monarch was, constitutionally, only Duke of Schleswig, of Holstein and of Lauenberg. See Schleswig-Holstein Question to determine the needs and positioning of coastal batteries. ;1796–1797 The service in home waters was broken by a year in the Mediterranean in command of Thetis where he delivered the annual tribute to the Bey of Algiers. On this voyage he carried Bertel Thorvaldsen to Malta.Thiele page 73 Fisker had diplomat, but unsuccessful,Topsoe-Jensen in Dansk Biografisk Leksikon with the old Bey of Tripoli, before being relieved by Steen Andersen Bille. ;1800–1805 Back in Danish waters, Fisker was on the Trindel Light commissionTrindel is a rocky reef northeast of Læsø, now (2012) being restored and managed as a marine nature reserve and, on land, enquiring into sites for placements of signal telegraphs.Enigma -Fisker's Telegraph System In 1805 he was head of a squadron of various types of gunboats undergoing trials of their performance and suitability for coastal defence. ==Active Service in Norway== After having worked as a recruitment officer in Norway, he joined (in 1806) the Construction Commission, but at the outbreak of hostilities with Britain the following year he was once again unemployed. In a very frank letter to the Prince Regent (later Frederick VI) he drew attention to Norway's unprotected state, as a result of which he was appointed Adjutant General of the navy in Norway and soon after as chief of the entire Norwegian naval defence - continuing the work already started by Jens Schou Fabricius and Hans Christian Sneedorff of reorganising Norway's preparedness. Within a year, with indefatigable hard work, he had a considerable number of gunboats and small armed vessels in service and in addition had improved harbour defences, and the coastal militia. On 27 April 1808, in the war against Sweden, he advanced with 24 gunboats towards Strömstad on the Swedish border, but at Furuholm met with strong resistance and had, after ninety minutes battle, to retire. Main article Battle of Furuholm ==Conflict with Fellow Officers and the Admiralty== ;1809 Promoted to Flag Rank, from Norway Fisker submitted his 1809 proposals for the conquest of Heligoland and the recapture of the island of Anholt. The 1809 Anholt expedition came to nought, frustrated by late winter storms, and the 1810 attempt, led by Jørgen Conrad de Falsen, failed miserably. Still, with the gunboats and brigs in Norwegian waters the Danish-Norwegian forces were able to capture, at various times in 1809, a total of two British brigs, 1 cutter, and 107 merchant ships. On 9 October 1809 Fisker was promoted to rear admiral. In this year Fisker was decorated with the Commander Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog, ;1810 Lorentz Fisker had personally laid the plans for the Norwegian brigs’ attack on a large British convoy in the Skagerrak in July 1810. The plan met with total success, with 48 (merchant) ships being stopped and brought into various Norwegian harbours and before prize courts. The auction thereafter of ships and cargoes raised some 5.2 million rigsdaler.modern day value of at least £20 million, based on corn, silver and gold price comparisons Fisker was disappointed, however, that he was awarded only the flag officer’s portion, whilst the portion reserved for the Admiralty went to governors who had had nothing to do with the affair. As Fisker had already undertaken a division of the prize money to the men under him, Admiral Michael Bille rejected the protest. This gave rise to considerable friction between Fisker and Michael Bille, and later with other colleagues – a conflict that left Fisker embittered and that was only resolved in 1816. ==Death== Lorentz Fisker's gravestone in Holmens Graveyard He retired from the service in 1810. With prize money paid out in 1812, Fisker bought properties near Hellestrup and Ringsted on Zealand. In 1812 he received the Grand Cross of the Order of the Dannebrog. He died in 1819, and was buried in Holmens Cemetery in Copenhagen. ==NotesReferencesCitations== *This article is largely translated from the Danish Wikipedia article :da:Lorentz Fisker which article acknowledges the Danish Biographical Dictionary edited by C.F.Bricka, Gyldendal (1887–1905) - see Project Runeberg as the primary source. *Project Runeberg: C With on Lorentz Fisker in Danish Biographical Dictionary *Thiele: The Life of Thorvaldsen, Collected from the Danish of J.

Andrews, Stewart Williams, Barry, November 1976, The Andrews patent bus represented an improvement in design over the vehicles previously used.Pictorial World, 9 December 1886 They were so successful that by 1891, 26 buses had been supplied. ==Andrews Star Omnibus Company== On 4 October 1892, a limited company was formed, Andrews Star Omnibus Company Limited, to take over the business of some buses which had been operating since 1888 under the name of S. Andrews & Son. The Directors were Solomon Andrews and his son, Francis Emile. The General Manager was William Alexander Perry. The company was based at 31-47 New Kent Road, leased from Samuel Plimsoll. In 1892 the routes of the company were as follows: *1 Elephant and Islington, 23 buses *2 Camberwell and Kings Cross, 10 buses *3 Edgware Road and Gower Street, 4 buses *4 Camberwell and Victoria, 14 buses Later routes were added as follows: *5 Camberwell and Clapham, 8 January 1893 *6 Hop Exchange and Gracechurch Street, 22 April 1893 *7 Tower Bridge, July 1896 *8 Peckham and Dulwich, July 1896 *9 Farringdon Road *10 Walham Green and Wandsworth ==Star Omnibus Company== Share of the Star Omnibus Company, issued 3. March 1905 On 4 March 1899 the Star Omnibus Company (London) Limited was formed to take over the business of the Andrews Star Omnibus Company. The directors were the same and William Alexander Perry was the Managing Director. By 1900 the company had 196 buses, and 1,797 horses. The company continued to expand and by 1902 there were 246 buses and 1,905 horses. In this year, there were negotiations with the London General Omnibus Company for it to take over the company for £222,750 (equivalent to £ in ), but the deal was unsuccessful. The company started to experience financial difficulties, reportedly because of the increase in electric tramway services in London. In 1905 the company purchased some motor buses, but these were unreliable and failed to deliver any profit for the company. The situation deteriorated, and the company withdrew the motor buses on 9 August 1907. In line with most other bus operators in London, there was a significant drop in profit, and the Star Omnibus Company was unable to withstand the competition from the London Underground and the tramway services. The company was wound up on 21 February 1908. ==Surviving vehicles== When the company ceased trading, the brother of William Alexander Perry, A.J. Perry purchased some vehicles and three of these survived. 1875 Knifeboard Bus This bus was owned by Bernard Mills Circus.

The MRK was formed with an initial strength of just 600 Officers and enlisted men placed under the authority of Captain () Pierre Coedes, a naval officer of mixed French-Cambodian origin, who acted as Chief of Naval Operations (). They manned a handful of World War II-vintage ex-French Navy vessels transferred to Cambodia at the end of the First Indochina War: French-made Light Patrol Boats (), US-made Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel (LCVP) and LCM (6) Landing Crafts. Most of the MRK's naval assets and personnel, together with its administrative headquarters, were harboured at the former French colonial riverine station situated in the Chrui Chhangwar Peninsula () across the Tonle Sap river from Phnom Penh. However, the tiny facilities proved so inadequate that the Navy HQ was allocated aboard an old French-made riverine vessel named La Payotte, permanently moored at Chrui Chhangwar base. Early expansion phase 1955–1964 Closely modelled after the Naval and riverine component of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps (CEFEO), the MRK received training, technical and material assistance primarily from France and the United States. At first, the Cambodian naval service continued to expand rapidly under French auspices between 1955 and 1957 – at this stage, a French Military Mission in Cambodia helped in the renovation or construction of new harbour facilities, provided technical assistance and training programs, and supervised equipment deliveries. The MRK also began to receive additional assistance from the United States Military Assistance Advisory Group (US MAAG) aid program, established since June 1955 at Phnom Penh. The cramped Chrui Chhangwar base was modernized and enlarged to accommodate a new dock designed for large-sized riverine vessels and a Naval Training School (), established in January 1955 to train ship crews and other specialized personnel. The MRK had no Naval academy at the time, so Khmer officer candidate students ( – EOM) were sent to France, in order to attend advanced Officer courses at the French Naval Academy in Brest. A new coastal naval base was constructed at Ream in Kampot Province, near the newly built port city of Sihanoukville (rechristened Kampong Som in 1970), equipped with a floating dock whilst the Cambodian Navy's tiny surface fleet was augmented at the time by the addition of fifteen sea and river crafts of British and US origin donated by the French government. Under the US MAAG aid program, the Cambodian Navy received three LSSLs, four Landing Craft Utility (LCU/YFU), two 63-foot Combat Salvage Boats (CSB) armed with M2 Browning 12.7mm Heavy Machine Guns, five LCM (8) LCUs, and more LCM (6) landing crafts. The neutrality years 1964–1970 By November 1963, MRK strength had grown to 1,200 Ratings and seamen under the command of the Chief of Naval Operations Captain Pierre Coedes until August 1969, when he was replaced by then Lieutenant commander () Vong Sarendy. However, its steady expansion came to a halt on 20 November 1963, when Prince Norodom Sihanouk cancelled all American aid in response to the coup against President Ngô Đình Diệm in South Vietnam and on 15 January 1964 the US MAAG aid program was suspended when Cambodia adopted a neutrality policy.Chinnery, The rise of the Eagle Flights in Vietnam, the air war over south-east Asia (2016), p. 26. Deprived of further American support, the MRK continued to rely on the French military mission to provide both vital basic and technical training for its own naval personnel, receiving thereafter some aid from China and Yugoslavia. Between 1965 and 1969, these latter countries delivered three Yulin-class gunboats and two TC-101 torpedo boats (the latter soon rendered unserviceable due to accidents and natural disasters), whilst France provided an EDIC III- class Landing craft tank (LCT) for coastal transport duties. As with the other branches of the then FARK, the Cambodian Navy's own military capabilities in the late 1960s remained low and the missions that they performed mirrored those of a peacetime River Police force or Coast Guard rather than a true Navy. Therefore, MRK activities were restricted to inland patrols on the Bassac River, the Mekong, and the Tonle Sap River in the vicinity of the namesake Great Lake whilst high seas operations were limited to routine inshore patrolling in the Gulf of Thailand.Cambodia Navy - History at GlobalSecurity.org, Accessed 24 Nov 2013 Pre-1970 fleet organization MRK strength in February 1970 stood at about 1,600 Ratings and seamen under the command of Captain Vong Sarendy, who manned a small fleet comprising two flotillas (one sea and one riverine) and a training squadron. They were organized as follows: * The Riverine Patrol Force ( – FPF), headquartered at the Chrui Chhangwar riverine Navy base operated one US Landing Craft Infantry (LCI) used as a riverine support gunboat, three British Harbour Defence Motor Launches, four US LCT, one British LCT, and an unspecified number of LCM (6) and LCVPs. * The Sea Patrol Force ( – FPM), based at the Ream naval base operated one US Landing Ship Infantry Large (LSIL/LCI) in the coastal support gunboat role, three US PC-461 class Patrol Craft, three Chinese Yulin-class gunboats, two US Rescue Boats, one French EDIC III-class LCT, three US Light Tugs, plus some LCM (6) landing crafts. * The Training Squadron (), allocated at the Naval Training School in Chrui Chhangwar, had four LCM (6) and two LCVPs employed for instruction purposes only. The Navy's inventory also included a small number of US, Thai, and South Vietnamese riverine and sea craft seized while straying into Cambodian territory. The captured vessels comprised one River Monitor (H) Howitzer version (MON), one LCM (6) landing craft, and two LCVPs taken from the South Vietnamese Navy (VNN), plus two Hurricane Aircat airboats captured from the US Special Forces by the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) in September 1967 and one US Navy LCU1466-class Landing craft utility that accidentally entered Cambodian waters in July 1968; in addition, ten Thai civilian fishing junks were apprehended after being washed ashore along the coast due to inclement weather. Main naval bases were located at the Chrui Chhangwar Peninsula, which harboured the MRK headquarters', the Naval Training School, and the riverine flotilla outside Phnom Penh and at Ream; the latter served not only as the headquarters of the sea flotilla, but also of the Cambodian Marine Corps – comprising four naval infantry battalions ( – BFM) maintained primarily for static defense, and a French-trained UDT- type Combat Swimmer Unit () employed in salvage operations, obstacle clearance, and underwater demolitions. Reorganization 1970–1972 Re- designated Khmer National Navy ( – MNK) on 9 October 1970, the Cambodian Navy and its fleet were given responsibility for escorting supply convoys on the lower Mekong-Bassac corridors. Such operations were carried out in conjunction with the Khmer Air Force (KAF), which began to provide since mid-1971 air cover to MNK convoys with their Douglas AC-47D Spooky gunships and later Helio AU-24 Stallion mini-gunships. In addition, the Navy also provided logistic support (including troop transport and casualty evacuation) for the FANK ground forces. Shortly after the March 1970 coup, however, the French military mission suspended all the cooperation with the Cambodian armed forces, thus depriving the new MNK of vital training and technical assistance. During this phase, the MNK was assisted in its new roles by the South Vietnamese Navy, which lent extensive convoy protection to riverine commercial shipping and helped patrol the Cambodian coastline to prevent North Vietnamese infiltration attempts. The MNK underwent a major reorganization program in late 1970, with the creation of two operational zones: a Riverine Region ( or RegFlu) headquartered at Chrui Chhangwar and a Maritime Region ( or RegMar) headquartered at Ream; a Mekong Special Zone ( – ZSM; later 12th Tactical Zone or Zone Tactique 12), also headquartered at Chrui Chhangwar was created in mid-1971 at Kandal Province, situated between the Cambodian Capital and the South Vietnamese border. The Sea Patrol Force and the Training Squadron remained untouched by these changes, though the Riverine Patrol Force was re- organized into three squadrons – the river patrol craft under the Riverine Patrol Division ( – DPF), the landing craft under the Assault Division () and the transport vessels under the Logistics Support Group ( – GSL). These new formations, together with the Naval Infantry battalions, were under the direct command of Captain (promoted to Commodore in December 1971) Vong Sarendy, who in turn reported directly to the FANK Chief-of-Staff for operational orders. As the newly restructured MNK had gained by late 1971 enough experience to commence its own escort and combat patrol operations, an expansion of its naval assets and support facilities, and training establishments was therefore deemed necessary. The two pre-existing Naval Bases were once again upgraded, while another two riverine stations were established on the lower Mekong corridor at Neak Leung in Kandal Province, and at the provincial capital of Kampong Chhnang, on the Tonle Sap River. To train officer cadets, a Naval Academy () was established at Chrui Chhangwar in late 1971, and an Enlisted Man Training Center (), which provided specialized courses for junior ranks was set up one Kilometer south of the Cambodian Capital. The MNK headquarters was moved from the old La Payotte vessel at Chrui Chhangwar to Phnom Penh, where it was provisionally allocated in a building at the Psar Thmei Central Market area before moving that same year to a permanent facility at the former French military mission compound in Norodom Boulevard near Wat Phnom. By January 1972 the MNK had expanded to 5,500 men, this number including 430 officers, although only 23 of them held the rank of Lieutenant commander or higher, and these were showing signs of fatigue due to over-work. To alleviate this problem, an input of 14 Cambodian officers were sent to the United States to attend advanced courses at various US naval training institutions. Eight students attended the US Naval Academy (USNA) at Annapolis, Maryland, whilst two senior officers went to the Naval War College (NWC) in Newport, Rhode Island and the Navy Supply Corps School (NSCS) in Athens, Georgia; four other students attended the small boat tactics school at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard (MINSY) and the adjacent Naval Inshore Operations Center at Vallejo, California. Harbour defense and special operations Following several attacks against merchant vessels anchored at Chrui Chhangwar Naval Base in early 1972, the MNK Fleet Command created a regimental-sized Harbour Defense Unit, the \\"Shock Commandos\\" () comprising two rifle battalions, to patrol its major port facilities and provide VIP protection, equipped with an assortment of outdated and modern US and captured Soviet or Chinese small-arms. The 1st Shock Commando Battalion ( – 1 BCC) and 2nd Shock Commando Battalion ( – 2 BCC), based respectively at Chrui Chhangwar and Ream, were supported on their duties by the Naval Infantry, who performed active riverbank patrolling. An American-trained SEAL unit was raised in mid-1973, being employed on reconnaissance missions along the banks of the Mekong and as shock troops on amphibious operations, and was subordinated to the MNK Amphibious Operations Command (French: Commandement des opérations amphibies – COA). Fleet Command Emulating its South Vietnamese parent organization, the Cambodian Navy's Fleet Command was placed under the authority of the MNK Chief of Naval Operations, who was responsible for the readiness of all sea and river craft. The Fleet Commander assigned and scheduled vessels to operate on the Riverine and Maritime Regions, and the Mekong Special Zone, the latter turned over to the Cambodian Army Command in February 1975, which were home ported in Chrui Chhangwar and Ream naval bases and normally returned there after concluding their assignments. On the field, the two regional and zone commanders assumed control of all naval or amphibious operations on their respective Regions, and the vessels under their command operated from the following interland or coastal ports: *Maritime Region – Ream/Kampong Som/Krong Koh Kong/Krong Kep *Riverine Region – Chrui Chhangwar/Kampong Chhnang/Kampong Cham *Mekong Special Zone – Phnom Penh/Neak Leung Expansion 1973–1974 In 1970 the Cambodian Navy had only eleven vessels in serviceable condition, including two ageing PC-461 class Patrol Craft, three LSSLs, one LSIL, one LCI, one LCT and a few armed fishing junks to patrol both the coastline and its waterways. That same year, under the auspices of the Military Equipment Delivery Team, Cambodia (MEDTC) assistance program, the MNK began to receive an influx of modern American-made sea and riverine craft after the US Navy disbanded its own Mobile Riverine Force ( \\"brown-water Navy\\") in Vietnam, and handed over its units to his South-east Asian allies under the Vietnamization policy. Deliveries were accelerated in February 1972 and continued until 1973, allowing the MNK to standardize its equipment tables on US lines and gradually phase out some of its obsolete, worn-out ex-French and Eastern Bloc craft from active service. The MNK also received some material aid from the Royal Thai Navy, in the form of nine small motorboats delivered in July 1971. Initially expanded in December 1973 to 13,000–14,000 personnel, the MNK authorized strength ultimately reached by September 1974 a total of 16,500 men and women under the command of the Chief of Naval Operations, Commodore (promoted to Rear Admiral in October 1974) Vong Sarendy, with one-third of its personnel being assigned to the Marines. The remaining 10,000 or so sailors and ratings manned an impressive surface fleet of 171 vessels of various types, though consisting mostly of patrol, coastal, and amphibious crafts. ==Shipyards and repair facilities== The MRK/MNK's major repair and resupply facilities were centered at the main riverine base at Chrui Chhangwar, with most vessel maintenance being accomplished at the Fleet Repair Facility, though they apparently experienced some difficulties in repairing heavily damaged vessels – in April 1972, an LCI assigned to the Riverine Region severely hit by enemy fire had to be sent to Singapore for a major overhaul. Most shore-based naval supplies were handled by the Chrui Chhangwar base's naval warehouses; lesser activities were carried out at some of the smaller coastal and river stations. Whereas the Chrui Chhangwar base was nonetheless able to maintain the smaller vessels, the Ream Naval Base was in a run-down condition by 1970. Built by the French in the late 1950s, it had only one small pier in decrepit condition, its internal repair capabilities were very limited and lacked completely an effective logistical support system. Plans were laid out by the MNK Fleet Command in 1974 to renovate and enlarge Ream's naval facilities, but none of these were implemented before the collapse of the Khmer Republic in April 1975. ==Equipment== Escort and combat patrol craft * Two PC-461 class Patrol Craft * Three LSSLs * 20 PCF/Inshore Mark Mk 1 and 2 coastal patrol crafts (also known as \\"Swift boats\\") * 64 PBR Mk 1 and 2 river patrol boats (a.k.a. \\"Bibber\\") * Seven Monitors (MON, heavily gunned riverine crafts, a.k.a. \\"River Battleships\\" or \\"Mike boats\\") – out of this number six were the Monitor (H) Howitzer version armed with 40mm cannons and M49 105mm Howitzers * One Monitor (F) version equipped with M10-8 Flamethrowers (a.k.a. \\"Zippo\\") * Four Assault Support Patrol Boats Mk 1 (ASPB, a.k.a. \\"Alpha boats\\") * Two Patrol Craft/Tug (YTL) Troop transport, amphibious assault, and logistical operations craft * One EDIC III-class LCT * Two LSIL/LCIs * Four LCU/YFUs * 18 Armored Troop Carriers (ATC, a.k.a. \\"Tango boats\\"), including three ATC refuelers and one ATC recharger * 30 Landing Craft Mechanized Mk 6 Mod 1-LCM (6) Landing Craft Utility (LCUs) * Five LCM (8) LCUs. * Two Landing Craft Vehicle Personnel (LCVPs) Support craft * Two Command and Communications Boats (CCB, a.k.a. \\"Charlie boats\\") * Five Minesweeper River boats (MSR/MSM) * One Combat Salvage Boat (CSB) * Three Yard Tug Light (YTL) * Two Mobile Support Bases (MSB) * One Floating Crane (YD) * One Drydock ==Combat history== Regarded as the most efficient branch of the Cambodian armed forces, the Khmer National Navy combat record remains impressive. Being an all-volunteer, technically proficient service, the MNK was plagued by shortages of officers and experienced NCOs in the early stages of the war but unlike the Cambodian Army and the Khmer Air Force, it was not seriously handicapped by corruption, constant changes in command, or military incompetence, though it did faced severe budgetary restraints after US financial aid was slashed in 1973. Under the command of Rear Admiral Vong Sarendy, the MNK generally maintained high levels of efficiency, discipline and morale – mainly due to sufficient rice rations, good leadership in the field and prompt payment of wages. Since the MNK was not highly dependent from on US air support (except on the Bassac- lower Mekong corridors), it was not adversely affected when it was terminated on 15 August 1973.{[rp241-2}} Sea operations 1970–75 For the first three years of the war, the small and ill-equipped MNK Sea Patrol Force based at Ream proved unable to protect effectively the 400 kilometers (248.55 miles) of Cambodian coastline from North Vietnamese infiltration attempts. The coast from Ream to the Thai border was patrolled haphazardly at best by MNK's aging coastal vessels, so surveillance of the coastline from Ream to the border with South Vietnam was consequently passed to the South Vietnamese Navy. The importance of patrolling at sea became clear in April 1972, when VNN patrols reported the first attempt by a North Vietnamese vessel to infiltrate Cambodia's territorial waters. The enemy vessel was intercepted and sunk by the MNK, with heavy secondaries. Due to the shortage of assets, protection of Ream Naval Base and the deep water port of Kampong Som was largely neglected, which rendered them vulnerable to enemy frogman attacks – on the night of 20–21 January 1973 North Vietnamese frogmen managed to inflict slight damage on a cargo ship anchored at Kampong Som harbour. By 1974 this state of affairs had been corrected by the MNK Fleet Command, after the implementation of several counter-measures which included the stationing of newly received 20 radar-equipped PCF coastal patrol crafts at Ream and of four PBR river patrol boats in the Kampong Som port area, followed by the overhauling of nearly all of the older heavy craft still in the inventory. Amphibious operations 1973–74 Besides convoy escort duties on the lower Mekong, resupply missions of governmental garrisons, and routine patrolling along the Tonle Sap River and counter-insurgency operations coordinated with the Cambodian Army's Lake Brigade in the namesake adjoining lake, the Cambodian Navy's riverine forces also mounted a series of notable amphibious operations, codenamed \\"Castor\\" (French word for Beaver), in support of Naval Infantry battalions and FANK ground forces units fighting the Khmer Rouge in several conventional battles: *On 24 August 1970, the MNK riverine flotilla carried out its first amphibious operation when they transported by landing craft four infantry battalions and four airborne battalions to relieve Prek Tameak, a government outpost threatened by the PAVN, located 14 km (8.70 mi) northeast of Phnom Penh on the eastern bank of the Mekong. *During the Battle of Kampong Cham in September 1973, the MNK Fleet Command launched Operation \\"Castor 21\\", in which the Navy ran some twenty convoys between Phnom Penh and Kampong Cham. They conducted a successful combined amphibious assault by the Marines, SEALs and the Cambodian Army's 80th Infantry Brigade into the enemy-held half of the city, although the inept use of the landing crafts led to heavy losses as the boats on the river were exposed for six hours to enemy fire from the riverbanks. *In October 1973, the MNK riverine forces mounted Operation \\"Castor 27\\", a three- day amphibious operation in support of the Cambodian Army's 2nd Infantry Division elements operating south of Ta Khmao, along the northern bank of the Bassac river in Kandal Province. *In January 1974, during Operation \\"Castor 41\\" a task-force of nine river Monitors and landing crafts supported three Marine companies in a small-scale amphibious assault to clear Khmer Rouge forces out from the Peam Reang island in the southern Mekong. *In March 1974, two small operations, \\"Castor 45\\" and \\"Castor 46\\", were organized in support of Marine and Army units deployed around Dei Doh, on both banks of the Mekong. *That same month at the Battle of Oudong, the MNK carried out its second large-scale amphibious assault, Operation \\"Castor 50\\", during which another task-force of assault landing crafts was ferried up the Tonle Sap river to retake Oudong, the capital of Oudong Meanchey Province from the Khmer Rouge, who were waiting for them at the predicted landing site with B-40 rocket launchers and Type 56 75mm recoilless rifles. Although the MNK task-force lost one Armoured Troop Carrier, two LCM (8) LCUs and one LCM (6), and some 25 soldiers were killed at debarkation, they did managed to deliver thirty M113 APCs, six trucks, four M101A1 105mm towed field howitzers, and no less than 2,740 Marine and Army troops, who succeeded in recapturing the burn-out town. Final operations 1974–75 As the 1974–75 dry season opened, the already hard-pressed MNK saw its effectiveness being immediately curtailed by the Khmer Rouge's extensive mine-laying campaign on the Bassac and Mekong rivers, intended at blocking the passage of the supply convoys that allowed the beleaguered Khmer Republic to receive much-needed ammunition, fuel and non- lethal aid (including food and medical supplies) transported upriver from South Vietnam to Phnom Penh. Chinese-made submerged floating river mines had been employed early in the war by the North Vietnamese against both military and civilian commercial shipping along the Mekong River, but never at such a scale. Although the MNK did possess minesweeping capabilities, its five river MSR/MSM minesweepers lacked the proper equipment that would allow their crews to carry out the task successfully. In addition, the Khmer Rouge control of the riverbanks rendered any mine-sweeping operations virtually impossible or, at best extremely costly. On 18 January 1975, the MNK riverine forces and the Marines conducted their last joint amphibious operation – codenamed Operation \\"Sailor\\" –, in an effort to clear Khmer Rouge units from some strategic islands in the Mekong close to Phnom Penh. By 17 February, the MNK Fleet Command was forced to abandon any attempts to re-open the lower Mekong and Bassac corridors, and all convoy escort operations were suspended. With the loss of Neak Leung and respective river station on 1 April, all Cambodian Navy river assets were pulled out from the lower Mekong to help defend Phnom Penh, thus completing the strangulation of the Cambodian capital. This move however, rendered useless the entire MNK riverine flotilla which remained bottled-up mainly at Chrui Chhangwar base, with a small number of other vessels being withheld at Kampong Chhnang riverine station and Kampong Cham fluvial harbour during the final weeks of the war. Faced with the imminent Khmer Rouge victory in April 1975, MNK vessels of the Sea Patrol Force based at Ream lost no time in evacuating along the coast refugees to safety. On 17 April, the day Phnom Penh fell, two PC-461 class Patrol Craft (E-311 and E-312), one LSIL (P-111), one LCI (P-112) and three PCFs overloaded with Navy personnel and their civilian dependents left Cambodian territorial waters. E-311 managed to escape safely to neighbouring Thailand whilst the three PCFs, overloaded with 625 refugees, arrived on 22 April at Kelatan, Malaysia; as for the E-312, P-111 and P-112 vessels, they arrived on 9 May at Subic Bay in the Philippines with 750 passengers. In addition, four PBRs, two Monitor (H) Howitzers and one Assault Support Patrol Boat were impounded by the South Vietnamese authorities at Tân An, Long An Province in South Vietnam, which prevented their destruction or capture by the Khmer Rouge. ==Aftermath== By the end of the war in 1975, total Cambodian Navy losses amounted to a quarter of its ships and 70 percent of its sailors had been killed or wounded in action.Shawcross, Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the destruction of Cambodia (1979), p. 347. The rest of the MNK personnel that were unable to leave Cambodia – ranging from Petty Officers, enlisted men and the female clerical staff to Marines, Nageurs de Combat, SEALs and the Commandos de Choc – had no other choice but to surrender. Most of them ended up being shot by Khmer Rouge firing squads, with their bodies dumped into shallow graves dug in forest areas close to naval facilities; others were sent to be \\"re-educated\\" in labour camps (known as the \\"Killing Fields\\"), where they remained until the Cambodian–Vietnamese War of 1978–79. Later unconfirmed reports claim that a small number of qualified naval personnel escaped this fate by being pressed into service of the new Khmer Rouge regime in order to operate and maintain the remaining US-made sea and river craft left behind, and to help train ship crews. Many naval officers were also executed, including Rear Admiral Vong Sarendy, who missed several opportunities to leave Phnom Penh and was reportedly arrested and killed while trying belatedly to escape by boat to the Tonle Sap lake the day Phnom Penh fell. Of the 103 ratings that graduated from the Naval Academy in 1973, only three are known to have survived the Khmer Rouge's massive purges.Micheleti, The APRONUC Battalion in Cambodia, RAIDS Magazine (1992), p. 12 (box). The Khmer Rouge was able to seize intact some 13 coastal patrol \\"Swift boats\\", 40 PBR Mk 1 and 2 \\"Bibber\\" river patrol boats and five LCM (8) LCUs for the Navy of the Kampuchea Liberation Army (NKLA) of Democratic Kampuchea; the other sea and river vessels were found damaged beyond repair, either sunk by enemy fire or scuttled by their own crews. At least four NKLA's \\"Swift boats\\" were later lost during the Mayaguez incident in May 1975, on which one of the boats was sunk by a US Air Force AC-130 gunship. Despite maintenance problems and spare parts' shortages, the remaining nine coastal patrol \\"Swift boats\\", the PBR river patrol boats and the LCUs were kept serviceable at Ream and Chrui Chhangwar naval bases until February 1979, when the NKLA was neutralized by the People's Army of Vietnam. ==MRK and MNK Chiefs of Naval Operations== *Captain Pierre Coedes (1954–1969) *Rear Admiral Vong Sarendy (1969–1975) ==Naval uniforms and insignia== The Royal Cambodian Navy owed its origin and traditions to the French Far East Naval Forces ( – FMEO) of the First Indochina War, and even after the United States took the role as the main foreign sponsor for the Khmer National Armed Forces at the beginning of the 1970s, French military influence was still perceptible in their uniforms and insignia. Service dress and field uniforms The basic Royal Cambodian Navy (MRK) work uniform for all-ranks was a local version of the French Navy's tropical working dress, consisting of a Pale Stone (a shade of grey so pale that is sometimes referred to as \\"pale khaki\\" due to its similarity to the latter colour) cotton shirt and pants modelled after the WWII US Army tropical \\"Chino\\" khaki working dress. The shirt was short-sleeved and came in two variants: the first model was based on the French M1949 tropical shirt () and had two patch breast pockets closed by clip-cornered straight flaps whilst the second model resembled the French M1946 light shirt () and featured instead two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps; both shirts had a six- buttoned front and were provided with shoulder straps (). They were worn with matching Pale Stone slacks styled after the French M1945/52 or M1948 pants, which featured two pleats at the front hips, side slashed pockets and an internal pocket at the back, on the right side; Pale Stone shorts () were also issued and worn according to weather conditions. A white cotton version of the MRK work uniform also existed, being worn as a service dress by officers on informal occasions and for walking-out. Enlisted personnel also received a white cotton service uniform, consisting of a Navy jumper (or pullover shirt) with dark blue flap collar and matching trousers flared as \\"bell bottoms\\". MRK senior officers and petty officers adopted a Navy Blue overseas service uniform, which consisted of a double-breasted reefer jacket () with open collar and lapels, and featuring two internal skirt pockets with external flaps. The jacket had a narrow double row of four gilt metal anchor motif buttons, and was worn with a white shirt and black tie, completed with matching blue trousers. This uniform was seldom seen in Cambodia, being worn only by officers or officer candidate students attending courses overseas, e.g. when in France or in the US. Instead, MRK Officers serving in-country received the standard FARK summer dress uniform in white cotton, which was patterned after the French Army M1946/56 khaki dress uniform (). The jacket had two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps and two unpleated at the side closed by straight ones whilst the sleeves had false turnbacks; the front fly and pocket flaps were secured by gilt buttons bearing the royal coat-of-arms. It was worn with a white shirt and black tie on formal occasions. For parades and honor guards, Naval Infantry officers and enlisted men were given a special full dress white cotton uniform, which consisted of a tunic with standing collar featuring a five-buttoned front secured by gilt buttons, worn with matching white slacks. Cambodian Marine officers and enlisted men were issued the same French all-arms M1947 drab green fatigues () as their Royal Army counterparts. All the aforementioned uniform combinations were maintained by the MNK after 1970 and new regulation sets were added. In 1974, graduates of the Cambodian Naval Academy attending courses overseas received a new parade uniform, apparently patterned after the US Navy Officers' Blue Working Dress. The new cadets' blue full dress consisted on a six-buttoned shirt lacking shoulder straps with two unpleated patch breast pockets closed by pointed flaps and long sleeves with buttoned cuffs, and matching trousers. In formal occasions, the shirt was worn with a black tie tucked into the front fly. Female personnel were issued white summer dress and working Pale Stone M1946-style short-sleeved blouses based on their male counterparts' versions, except that the blouse front fly closed on the left side, and were worn with matching summer dress white or working Pale Stone knee-length skirts. Like their Army and Air Force counterparts, in 1970–72 all naval combat and support personnel – officer candidate students (EOMs) attending courses at the Naval Academy, clerical staff, ship crews, Naval Infantry, Nageurs de Combat and later the Commandos de Choc security battalions – were issued US jungle OG 107 utilities and M1967 Jungle Utility Uniforms whilst the Cambodian Navy SEALs commandos formed in 1973 received \\"Highland\\" (ERDL 1948 Leaf pattern or \\"Woodland\\") and Tigerstripe camouflage fatigues from the United States, Thailand (Thai Tadpole), and South Vietnam (Tadpole Sparse). Olive green US M-1951 field jackets were also issued to all- ranks. Headgear MRK officers and petty officers received a Pale Stone service peaked cap with the standard gilt metal FARK cap badge, based on the French M1927 pattern () but with a longer, lacquered black leather extended peak; a white summer top version was worn with both the white service dress and the full dress uniform. After March 1970, the MNK replaced the royal insignia on their peaked caps by a gold wreathed fouled anchor embroidered on black, with the number of leaves varying according to rank – ten for officers and petty officers, and six for NCOs (enlisted men wore a simple anchor badge instead). An American-style \\"Dixie cup\\" white hat was worn with the white service uniform by enlisted ranks. In the field, MRK sailors and naval infantrymen frequently wore a mixture of French M1946 light khaki tropical berets (French: Bérét de toile kaki clair Mle 1946), French M1946 and M1957 light khaki sidecaps ( and Bonnet de police de toile kaki clair Mle 1957), and French M1949 bush hats () in Khaki or OG cotton cloth. During the Republic, a wide range of OG \\"Boonie hats\\" and baseball caps from the US, South Vietnam and Thailand were adopted by MNK personnel. Officer candidate students at the Naval Academy received a Navy Blue baseball cap with the standard MNK cap badge whilst white and Pale Stone baseball-style caps, with stiffened peak and standard MNK cap badge inserted on a square-shaped Navy Blue background patch placed on the front panel, were worn by female personnel with their white summer dress and working Pale Stone uniforms. The Cambodian SEALs adopted in 1973 a black beret worn French-style pulled to the left with the MNK cap badge placed above the right eye, replaced in the field by bush hats, baseball caps, berets or head scarves in both Highland and Tigerstripe camouflaged cloth. The steel helmet models worn by MRK vessel crews and marines alike were the US M-1 or the French M1951 NATO () models, standard issue in the FARK. The naval infantry battalions later standardized on the M-1 1964 model provided with the US Army Mitchell \\"Clouds\\" camouflage pattern cover (an embroidered yellow fouled anchor motif was often added to the latter), though many ship crewmen and naval gunners continued to wear the older US and French steel helmets throughout the war. On parade, the marines were issued white-painted M-1 helmet liners with the standard FARK cap badge stencilled at the front and colour bars painted at the sides, worn with a white chinstrap; after 1970, a FANK cap badge stencil replaced the earlier royal arms. Footwear MRK footwear was diverse. Ratings and sailors were issued black, brown, and whitened leather low laced shoes matching the dress uniforms worn on active service, walking-out or formal occasions. For parades, Marine officers and enlisted men were turned out in French black leather M1952 ankle boots () and white French-style half-gaiters with side-lacing and a spat covering the top of the boot; Naval Academy cadets favoured white American-style long gaiters upon the adoption of their blue full dress in 1974. On the field, both seamen and naval infantrymen wore brown leather US M-1943 Combat Service Boots and French M1953 \\"Rangers\\" (French: Rangers modéle 1953) or French canvas-and- rubber Pataugas tropical boots, and sandals; after 1970, the MNK retained the earlier regulation footwear although American M-1967 black leather and Jungle boots, and South Vietnamese Bata tropical boots soon replaced the older combat models. Navy Ranks The MRK used the same standard FARK/FANK French-style rank chart as the Army and the Khmer Air Force, though the nomenclature was different. Flag, senior and junior officers () – including their counterparts in the Naval Infantry – and petty officers' () ranks were worn on various coloured removable shoulder boards (with gold laurel-like leaf embroidery on the outer edge for Admirals) or shoulder strap slides identical to the Army pattern, with the addition of a miniature royal coat-of-arms featuring a combined crown-and-anchor device on the inner end. Enlisted men and Marine NCOs () wore chevrons on both upper sleeves. In 1970 the MNK changed the colours of their shoulder boards and shoulder strap slides to a standardized Navy Blue or black with a simple fouled anchor on the inner end, which replaced the earlier royal crest. Naval and marine officers and NCOs adopted rank chest tabs to wear with the US-supplied OG jungle fatigues though Army- pattern metal pin-on collar rank insignia also came into use in 1972. {  - !MNK Ranks !Khmer language !French naval ranks !US naval ranks !Insignia - Pʊəl too ពលទោ Matelot/Fusilier-marin Seaman/Marine rifleman  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  (no insignia) - Pʊəl aek ពលឯក Matelot breveté Able seaman  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px - Niey too នាយទោ Quartier Maître Chef Seaman 1st Class  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px - Niey aek នាយឯក Second Maître Petty Officer 2nd class  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px - Pʊəl baal trəy ពលបាលត្រី Maître Officer 1st class  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px - Pʊəl baal too ពលបាលទោ Premier Maître Chief Petty Officer  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px - Pʊəl baal aek ពលបាលឯក Maître Principal Master Chief Petty Officer  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px - Prɨn baal aek ព្រឹន្ទបាលឯក Aspirant Midshipman  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px - Aknu say ney trəy អនុសេនីយ៍ត្រី Enseigne de vaisseau de deuxième classe Sub-Lieutenant/Ensign  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px - Aknu say ney tor អនុសេនីយ៍ទោ Enseigne de vaisseau de première classe Lieutenant Junior Grade  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px - Aknu say ney ek អនុសេនីយ៍ឯក Lieutenant de vaisseau Lieutenant  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px - Vorak say ney trəy វរសេនីយ៍ត្រី Capitaine de corvette Lieutenant Commander  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  50px - Vorak say ney tor វរសេនីយ៍ទោ Capitaine de frégate Commander  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px - Vorak say ney ek វរសេនីយ៍ឯក Capitaine de vaisseau Captain  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px - Odam say ney trəy ឧត្តមសេនីយ៍ត្រី Amiral Admiral  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"  50px - Odam say ney tor ឧត្តមសេនីយ៍ទោ Contre-Amiral Rear Admiral  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  50px } Insignia There were no arm-of-service designations as such in the Khmer National Navy, although when wearing US OG jungle fatigues, naval personnel skills and trades were identified by collar badges, in either metal pin-on or cloth embroidered versions. These were worn on the left collar only by ratings and on both collars by enlisted ranks: *Navigator (Manuvrier) – pair of binoculars superimposed upon crossed signal flags; *Helmsman (Timonier) – six-spoked helm wheel; *Radio operator (Telegrafiste) – lightning bolt superimposed upon a flying spinning wheel or cutter; *Gunner (Canonier) – crossed cannons; *Armourer (Armurier) – cannon superimposed upon a cogwheel; *Machinist (Mechanicien) – boat propeller inserted on a cogwheel; *Electrician (Electricien) – dynamo with six lightning bolts; *Quartermaster (Fourrier/Fourrière) – five-pointed leaf; *Clerk (Secretaire) – crossed writing plumes; *Shipyard Artificer (Ouvrier naval) – crossed axes; *Steward/Stewardess (Maître d'Hotel/Maîtresse d'Hotel) – laurel-leaf wreath over a three-wave line; *Commissary/Storekeeper (Commissaire) – lotus flower; *Civil Engineer (Ingénieur Civile) – Buddhist temple tower and anchor inserted on a cogwheel; *Marine Rifleman/Naval Infantry (Fusilier-Marin) – crossed rifles. MNK personnel after 1970 wore over the left pocket of their Pale Stone working or service dress white shirts a cloth embroidered badge featuring two crossed anchors inserted on a wreath surmounted by three stars, all in yellow outlined black on a Pale Stone or white background. A subdued version was worn with the OG jungle fatigues. Navy Blue and subdued nametapes were worn over the right shirt or jacket pocket on OG jungle fatigues and Pale Stone working and service dress white uniforms; plastic nameplates were occasionally worn with the Navy Blue overseas service dress over the left breast and the working uniform on the right breast. Officers were entitled to wear on the right pocket of their working uniforms and jungle fatigues a full-colour cloth embroidered Navy Blue round patch with two white crossed anchors set on a yellow wreath. This patch came in two versions: one with a yellow star superimposed on the crossed anchors was worn by line officers (former officer cadets that had undergone training for the command of a vessel at the Khmer Naval Academy) whereas those without the star were given to non-line officers. Specialised services within the Khmer National Navy wore full-colour cloth embroidered shield insignia on their upper left sleeve (Nageurs de Combat and SEALs wore their round unit patches on the right pocket of their fatigue shirts); MNK personnel assigned to a specific Maritime or Riverine Region wore the correspondent insignia on the upper right sleeve. MNK headquarters insignia went to the right shoulder. MNK officers sent for training overseas wore on the upper left sleeve of their Navy Blue overseas jackets and Pale Stone working shirts a Cambodian national emblem with \\"Marine Nationale Khmère\\" tab, or a simple rectangular flash bearing \\"Khmer Republic\\" inscribed in either French or Khmer script on a Cambodian national flag background. ==See also== * Brownwater Navy * Cambodian Civil War * Cambodian Marine Corps * Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces * Khmer National Armed Forces * Khmer Republic * Khmer Rouge * Mayaguez incident * Mobile Riverine Force * Royal Cambodian Armed Forces * Royal Cambodian Navy * Royal Lao Navy * South Vietnamese Navy * Weapons of the Cambodian Civil War ==NotesReferences== *Elizabeth Becker, When the War was over Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution, Simon & Schuster, New York 1988. *Kenneth Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975, Equinox Publishing (Asia) Pte Ltd, Djakarta 2011. *Kenneth Conboy, Kenneth Bowra, and Mike Chappell, The War in Cambodia 1970–75, Men-at-arms series 209, Osprey Publishing Ltd, London 1989. *Russell R.

ISSN 1368-485X ==Design and development== The aircraft was designed as a light weight paramotor, giving due consideration to the fact that the pilot has to wear the engine on his or her back and run with it for take-off. It features a paraglider-style high-wing, single-place accommodation and a single Per Il Volo Top 80 engine in pusher configuration. As is the case with all paramotors, take-off and landing is accomplished by foot. To keep the design as light as possible a simple harness is used. The single cylinder, two-stroke, fan-cooled aircraft engine incorporates some unique features that make it especially suitable for its role. Its reduction gearbox results in the engine and propeller turning in different directions, thereby reducing the resulting torque absorbed by the pilot . The engine also incorporates a centrifugal clutch that allows the engine to idle without the propeller turning, which improves safety during canopy inflation and launch, as well as landing. The aircraft can be completely disassembled for ground transportation or storage. The aluminum and fibreglass frame folds and the fuel tank is removable. ==Variants== ;Miniplane 115 :Version with smaller propeller with a diameter of . ;Miniplane 125 :Version with larger propeller with a diameter of . ==Specifications (Miniplane 125) See alsoReferences * Category:1980s Italian ultralight aircraft Category:Single-engined pusher aircraft Category:Paramotors ","title":"Per Il Volo Miniplane"},{"id":"35293420","text":"The dome of San Sebastiano in Milan. Agostino Comerio (May 12, 1784 - August 5, 1834) was an Italian painter, active mainly in Northern Italy. ==Life and career== He was born in Locate, near Como, to Filippo Comerio, a painter from Milan and Lauretana Benini of Faenza. He apprenticed under his father. In 1800, he moved to Milan, and attended the academy of art. Under the patronage of Cardinal Dugnani, he stayed in Rome in 1803-1805 to study painting; in 1805 he won the first prize in the Accademia del Campidoglio, which was then led by Antonio Canova. In 1806 he gained a government scholarship. He returned to Lombardy in 1810, and sculpted some statues for the Cathedral of Milan. He was recruited to Mantua as a designer of the works of Giulio by the philanthropic committee established by Count Miollis, including models for a large bronze sculpture for St. Andrew, never cast. In 1814 he traveled to Paris and London. Returning to Verona, he decorated the apartments of the Count Erbisti, the Marquis Giovanni Pindemonte, the Marquis di Fracastoro, and others. He engraved Brusasorci's Cavalcade of Clement VII and Charles V. He continued to receive commissions in Vicenza, Milan, and Lombardy. He painted in fresco in San Satiro in Milan and in the Santuario della Madonna della Bocciola in Ameno near the Lago d'Orta.

Two years later, he published his first novel, Străinul (The Stranger). His first screenplay appeared in 1957. It was an adaptation of the novel Moara cu noroc (The Lucky Mill) by Ioan Slavici. From then on, he concentrated on screenwriting, working with prominent directors such as Liviu Ciulei, Andrei Blaier, Manole Marcus and Sergiu Nicolaescu. In 1974, he became a corresponding member of the Romanian Academy and joined the Writers' Union of Romania. He was also a member of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party and served in the Great National Assembly as a Deputy from Bihor County. He died as the result of an automobile accident near Tulcea. It was later suggested that his death was not accidental but, rather, that he was eliminated because he knew too much about the Party's former Nomenklatura.

It was the first magazine title created in-house by Carstens Publications. As a magazine dedicated to trains and rail transportation, it stands out from its main competitor Trains as a publication focused on the enthusiast and related activities. Established in 1974 as Railfan magazine (ISSN 0098-0714), it merged in 1979 with Railroad magazine, which Carstens purchased at that time. The magazine was renamed Railfan & Railroad, but the two former titles were listed separately on the masthead until 2015. The magazine was acquired by White River Productions in September 2014. The magazine is produced monthly, edited by Steve Barry. ==Founding and early days== As early as 1968, future Railroad Model Craftsman editor Tony Koester visited publisher Harold Carstens to pitch an idea for a \\"railfan's\\" magazine, at the insistence of his friend Jim Boyd (who was at the time an occasional contributor to RMC). At the time, Carstens cited the lack of potential advertisers and stiff competition from the long-established Trains and Railroad magazines as a reason for not starting the new publication. As a result of that initial meeting, Carstens did make an offer to Koester to join the staff of RMC. By 1971, Jim Boyd had joined Carstens Publications to work on sister publication Flying Models, and Koester was editor of Railroad Model Craftsman. In the fall of 1974, publisher Hal Carstens had a change of heart given the popular rise of the railroad enthusiast movement, and the increased potential for advertising revenue. He tipped off Boyd and Koester that he intended to produce a quarterly publication, starting with a Winter 1974 issue. The new publication would be known simply as Railfan as an indicator of its intended target market. Within a matter of weeks, Boyd and Koester had produced the first issue of the new magazine. == Rise in popularity and expansion == The 1970s were a period of dynamic change for American railroads, as many were facing bankruptcy in the face of shifting traffic patterns and increased labor and fuel costs. Unprofitable branch lines were abandoned or sold, and many railroad companies sought merger partners in order to avoid bankruptcy. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the industrial Northeast (known colloquially as the \\"Rust Belt\\") where competing railroads sought to reduce redundant routes and modernize their physical plants. With this rapid modernization, many historic pieces of vintage railroad equipment were scrapped, though a great many more were saved, thanks to the rise in railfan activity and the development and support of the railway preservation movement. By the mid-1970s, preparations were underway to celebrate the nation's bicentennial, and with it came a renewed interest in railroad heritage, namely the return of several steam locomotives to main line excursion service. Amidst all of this change, Railfan & Railroad not only reported on these activities, but also encouraged them and the \\"railfan\\" culture. Response to the new magazine was favorable, and Railfan went to a bi-monthly schedule starting with the August 1977 issue. Part of the success of the new magazine has been attributed to Boyd's skill as a photographer and writer, as well as his real- world railroading experience and his personality. Upon the purchase of the defunct Railroad, the title was changed to Railfan & Railroad starting with the May 1979 issue. The masthead listed the publication serials of both titles until 2014. Railfan & Railroad increased production to a monthly schedule starting with the October 1987 issue, and with it, added Mike Del Vecchio as an associate editor. Associate editor Bruce Kelly, whose articles and photography had appeared in various rail publications since 1982, came on board in 1988 to assist with news and caption writing, column editing, map design, and overall production. More changes came to the magazine staff in the 1990s, first with the departure of Bruce Kelly in 1996. Prolific railroad photographer and New Jersey native Steve Barry replaced Kelly at the same time. Mike Del Vecchio took a position with industry journal Railway Age in 1996, which opened the door for the arrival of Chris Kimmler. == Post Jim Boyd era == Editor Jim Boyd retired in 1998 after 23 years at the helm of the magazine he helped shape, and Steve Barry was promoted to managing editor. In 1999, George Fletcher was added to the masthead as an associate editor, but his tenure was short lived as he accepted a position with the Long Island Rail Road in 2001. Walt Lankenau joined the staff in September 2000 as associate editor, after having previously worked for Carstens Publications as the editor of Creative Crafts & Miniatures in 1984, and later freelancing as a cartographer and books editor. Publisher Hal Carstens died unexpectedly in June 2009, and was succeeded by his son Henry as president of the company. Incremental changes to update the look and feel of the magazine began in 2010, when a new logo debuted to replace an earlier redesign dating from 1999. At the end of 2010, \\"Editor Emeritus\\" Jim Boyd suffered a heart attack and died near his home in Newton. In 2011, author and photographer Otto Vondrak joined the staff as associate editor after working as a contractor and freelancer for the previous year. Since its beginning, the editorial style of the magazine tends to be focused on the active enthusiast who is more likely to be engaged in the hobby by taking photographs of current railroad operations, visiting museums and tourist lines, and contributing to historical preservation activities. Topics range from the historic to the contemporary, and includes news photos and monthly columns to balance out the feature content. The magazine continues its focus on the railroad enthusiast, thanks in part to editor Steve Barry's involvement in the National Railway Historical Society and his enthusiasm for photography. The majority of content is contributed by the readers of the magazine, with the editors appearing as-needed. In December 2011, Railfan & Railroad expanded its reach with the debut of digital editions for home computers, laptops, and select mobile digital devices. ==White River Productions== After years of financial struggle, Carstens Publications president Henry Carstens announced the company's permanent closure on August 22, 2014. On September 1, 2014, White River Productions announced their acquisition of Railfan & Railroad as well as sister publication Railroad Model Craftsman. Eight pages were added to bring the publication up to 70 pages. Steve Barry and Otto Vondrak were retained as the editorial staff. News columnists were moved over from Railroads Illustrated, and the \\"LocoNotes\\" diesel roster updates were moved over from Trains & Railroads of the Past. Starting with the January 2017 issue, the magazine once again expanded to 78 pages. Eric Berger was added to the staff as News Editor in 2019. == Monthly columns == A slate of regular contributors author the monthly columns (\\"Departments\\") that appear in Railfan & Railroad magazine opposite the feature content. Departures - This monthly commentary is written by Alexander B. Craghead, and explores the hobby of railfanning from many perspectives as well as celebrating the heritage and future of railroading. Railnews - Compiled by associate editor Otto Vondrak with contributions from several regular columnists, Railnews features the month's top stories and photos submitted by readers. Many of the Railnews contributors were transferred from Railroads Illustrated magazine when production shifted from monthly to annual in 2014. Railnews is overseen by news editor Eric Berger. Transit Currents - The roots of this monthly column come from the \\"Electric Lines\\" feature edited by Steve Maguire in the old Railroad magazine. This later became \\"Transit Topics\\" and was carried over to the combined Railfan & Railroad in 1979. The column was later renamed \\"Transit Currents\\" and was edited by Prof. George M. Smerk until 2016. Bob Gallegos is the current editor, and the column covers commuter rail, rapid transit, and light rail, as well as selected historic trolley operations. Railfan Timetable - Readers submit their listings of railroad-related events and excursions to this free monthly listing. Capitol Lines - Veteran CBS reporter Wes Vernon covered railroading and how it was affected by government policy and politics coming out of Washington, D.C. until his retirement in May 2018. Veteran Washington Post journalist and former Trains Magazine columnist Don Phillips has since taken over responsibility for the column. LocoNotes - LocoNotes is first-hand reports of diesel locomotive locations and dispositions across North America, submitted by readers and compiled by Kenneth Ardinger. Scan Man - Edited by Vincent Reh, \\"Scan Man\\" discusses the world of railroad radio technology, and publishes on an alternating schedule with \\"Preservation Topics.\\" On The Menu - On the Menu is a monthly look on the nearly 100 dinner train operations across North America, as well as a fond look back at railroad dining experiences as well as reports on the latest trends, written by James D. Porterfield. Preservation Topics - Associate editor Otto Vondrak explores the world of historic railway preservation, museums, and tourist railroads around the country. Formerly known as \\"Lineside Legacy\\" authored by columnist Jeff Terry. Markers - This column is compiled by the editors to discuss items that do not normally fit the rest of the magazine, and occasionally features guest authors. Parting Shot - Formerly known as \\"Final Frame,\\" this is the last page of the magazine where a full-frame vertical format photo is featured. The title was adopted from Railroads Illustrated magazine. ==See also== * Railroad-related periodicals ==Notes External links == *Railfan & Railroad magazine site Category:1974 establishments in New Jersey Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Rail transport magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1974 Category:Magazines published in New Jersey ","title":"Railfan &amp; Railroad"},{"id":"35293517","text":"Bolton Town Hall facing Victoria Square in Bolton, Greater Manchester, England, was built between 1866 and 1873 for the County Borough of Bolton to designs by William Hill of Leeds and George Woodhouse of Bolton. The town hall was extended in the 1930s to the designs of Bradshaw, Gass and Hope and has been designated a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage. ==Background== The town hall was promoted by the mayor, J.R. Wolfendon, in the early 1860s. The cost was expected to be between £70000 and £80,000 but more than doubled to £167,000, equivalent to £ in . Bolton Corporation held a competition for a new town hall design in the 1860s. It was won by a pupil of Cuthbert Brodrick, architect William Hill from Leeds whose design was very similar to that of the 1858 Leeds Town Hall. It was opened by the Prince of Wales on 4 June 1873. Portsmouth Guildhall, also designed by Hill in 1890, is a similar, slightly larger copy of the town hall. In the early 1930s the town hall was extended and a crescent of civic buildings was built to the rear on a new street to provide office space. The extension matches the Victorian building externally, but is plain inside and contains offices. The town hall had a central hall lit by a clerestory that was gutted by fire on 14 November 1981. It was rebuilt as two public halls, the Albert Hall and Festival Hall. The halls are surrounded by an outer ring of offices. In 1978 Fred Dibnah made repairs to the clock tower and its 16 stone pillars. Whilst repairing the tower he gilded the sphere at the top. During the cold war, the county standby nuclear bunker was located directly below the town hall. It dates to the second world war and would have been modernised to offer protection from nuclear attack. ==Architecture== The original building on a rectangular plan is designed in the neoclassical style in the form of a temple with a tall baroque-style clocktower. The town hall has a high basement storey and two principal floors above in sandstone ashlar which is rusticated at basement level. It has a broad flight of steps up to a five-bay portico with a pediment in which there is a high-relief sculpture by William Calder Marshall. All the other architectural sculpture inside and out is by Burstall and Taylor, including the main staircase, the portico and the lions which flank the steps.Mapping the practice and profession of sculpture: Matthew TaylorBoltons mayors: Bolton Town Hall, a short history of a tall building Either side of the entrance are five-bay ranges of two storeys with round-arched windows to the first floor. A quarter-chiming clock by Potts of Leeds was installed in the tower in 1871. Bolton Town Hall's design was reused by original architect William Hill as the template to build Portsmouth Civic Town Hall in 1890, a near identical twin. Portsmouth's Town Hall was renamed Portsmouth Guildhall in 1926 when Portsmouth was elevated to city status. ==Civic Centre== Bolton Civic Centre The Civic Centre on Le Mans Crescent, housing the Bolton Museum, library, health clinics, and courts, was built in 1932–39 to the designs of Bradshaw Gass and Hope. Its plan is slightly asymmetric with end pavilions flanking a shallow crescent. There was previously a police station within the northern half of the building adjacent to the Magistrates' Court. This has been converted to offices although the former cells are still used for holding those facing transfer to prison or awaiting appearances before the court. The building has a steel frame faced in sandstone ashlar with parapets and a slate roof. It has three central arches accessing Cheadle Square. The Civic Buildings are Grade II listed. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Bolton ==References== Notes Bibliography * * * ==External links== * 1873 – Bolton Town Hall, Lancashire Category:Buildings and structures in Bolton Category:City and town halls in England Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Greater Manchester Category:William Hill buildings Category:Bradshaw, Gass & Hope buildings Category:Government buildings completed in 1873 ","title":"Bolton Town Hall"},{"id":"35293533","text":"Bang Bang Racing is a racing video game co-developed by Playbox and Digital Reality and published by Digital Reality.

The critic from Official PlayStation Magazine UK felt that it wasn't a \\"bad game, merely a game with no purpose.\\"PlayStation Official Magazine UK, Sept 2012, p 115 Cameron Lewis of Official Xbox Magazine felt that the omission of weaponry allowed the game to appeal to fans of older arcade racing games such as Super Sprint. He praised the addition of local multiplayer, but questioned the lack of online play. Lewis noted that the tracks were attractive and fun to drive, yet kept a difficulty level that made them difficult to master. Gamezebo's Mike Rose also praised the racing mechanics, including solid track design and strong AI opponents, but lamented the lack of online multiplayer. The Android version of the game received slightly better reviews. Will Wilson of Pocket Gamer gave the game a 6 out of 10.

The terms of the agreement stipulated that the new armed forces would consist of indigenous territorial units stationed within Cambodia to help maintain order and a mobile reserve (French: Reserve Mobile) comprising 8,000 Khmer soldiers, to be divided on equal halves of 4,000 each between the ARK and the mixed infantry units of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps (CEFEO), placed at the disposal of the French High Commissioner for Indochina. The formation and instruction of the ARK units was entrusted to a French Military Training Mission (French: Mission Militaire Française d'Instruction Militaire), staffed by French Army officers and NCOs, who acted as instructors and military advisers.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), pp. 12–13.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), p. 9.Cherami, Les médailles de régne du Royaume du Cambodge (2016), p. 25. Three days later, the first entirely Cambodian regular military unit, the 1st Khmer Rifle Battalion (French: 1ér Bataillon de Chasseurs Khmères – 1st BCK), was raised by the French Military Mission in Phnom Penh, formed by elements transferred from both the Khmer National Guard or \\"Indigenous Guard\\" (French: Garde Indigène) and the Cambodian Rifle Regiment (French: Régiment de Tirailleurs Cambodgiens – RTC), comprising three rifle battalions, of the colonial French Union Army. A second rifle battalion (French: 2éme Bataillon de Chasseurs Khmères – 2nd BCK), created out from locally recruited Khmer irregular auxiliaries (French: Supplétifs) was raised at Kratie in December that year. Both battalions were posted to the mobile reserve in January 1947. Led by a cadre of French officers and senior NCOs, and intended to be used on internal security operations to reinforce CEFEO regular troops, the new Khmer battalions saw their first combat in 1947 against Vietminh guerrilla forces in north-eastern Cambodia. Small-scale counter-insurgency operations, this time against the Cambodian nationalist Khmer Issarak rebel movement, continued over the next three years, during which the Khmer battalions gradually assumed responsibility for the defence of Battambang and Kampong Thom Provinces, which had been part of the territory returned to Cambodia by Thailand in early 1947. The ARK in the First Indochina War This period saw a rapid expansion of ARK units and by January 1947, its effective strength stood at about 4,000 men, of which 3,000 served in the Khmer National Guard (French: Garde Nationale Khmère). In July 1949, a second French–Khmer military agreement was signed, granting Cambodian military forces further operational autonomy in the Siem Reap and Kampong Thom provinces. Under an additional protocol signed in June 1950, Cambodian provincial governors were assigned the responsibility for the pacification of the provinces under their jurisdictions; to accomplish this mission they were given each a counter-insurgency force consisting of one independent Khmer infantry company. Late that year, a military assistance agreement was signed between the United States and France, which provided for the expansion of indigenous military forces in Indochina, and by 1952 ARK strength had reached 13,000 men, outnumbering the French CEFEO forces stationed in Cambodia. New Khmer rifle battalions were formed, specialized combat-support units were established, and a framework for logistical support was set up. A third Rifle Battalion (3rd BCK) was raised in August 1948 at Takéo, followed in January 1951 by other two rifle battalions (5th BCK and 6th BCK) at the French-run Pursat Infantry Training Centre (French: Centre d'Entrainement de Infanterie – CEI). Two armoured car squadrons were formed, the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron (French: 1ér Escadron de Reconnaissance Blindée – 1st ERB) in August 1950 and the 2nd Reconnaissance Squadron (French: 2éme Escadron de Reconnaissance Blindée – 2nd ERB) in July 1951 at Phnom Penh,Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), p. 193. and a Khmer Parachute Battalion (French: 1ér Bataillon Parachutiste Khmèr – 1st BPK) was officially created in December 1952.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), p. 175. Two additional infantry battalions were raised in April 1953 – 7th BCK in Siem Reap and 8th BCK at Ta Khmao in Kandal Province, bringing total strength up to 6,000 men, with about half serving in the Khmer National Guard and half in the mobile reserve. The latter at this time comprised three rifle battalions, with one of its battalions been allocated to French Union forces elsewhere in Indochina. Cambodian military units were given wider responsibility, including the protection of the rubber plantations along the middle Mekong River region, and surveillance of the coastal areas of the southern Cambodian provinces and of the eastern border areas with Cochinchina to prevent infiltration attempts by Vietminh guerrilla units. Although French-trained Khmer junior officers and NCOs slowly began to take a leading role over time, the ARK was still kept firmly under the control of the French High Command through its military training mission, renamed in 1951 \\"French Military Mission to the Government of Cambodia\\" (French: Mission Militaire Française près du Gouvernment du Royaume du Cambodge). The ARK General Staff was filled entirely by French senior and intermediate rank officers, who did most of the command-and-control support, intelligence work and training, and supervised weaponry and equipment deliveries to the Khmer military units. By mid-1953, however, at the instigation of their youthful King Norodom Sihanouk, Khmer military personnel began not only to participate in anti-French nationalistic demonstrations calling for complete Cambodian independence, but they also deserted French-led units by the hundreds. Following a world tour to publicize his campaign for independence, King Sihanouk retired to a \\"free zone of independence\\" set up at Battambang Province, where he was soon joined by 30,000 ARK troops and Police in a show of support and strength. In October that year, the French High Command finally agreed to transfer responsibility for Cambodian national security to the ARK and for that effect, another French-Khmer military agreement was signed. Under the terms of this agreement, the French-led Khmer military units were to be transferred to the control of the Cambodian national authorities, and that an operational zone was to be created in the east bank of the Mekong and assigned to the French Union forces. The latter was held jointly by the French Lower Mekong Operational Group (French: Groupement Opérationnel du Bas Mékong – GOBM) and ARK units, which provided security to the entire length of Route 13 inside Cambodia. The only elements that remained subordinated to the French Commander-in-Chief in Cambodia were the Military Mission and the GOBM. The ARK and the Khmer National Guard were consolidated into a new national defense force comprising 17,000 men, the Cambodian National Armed Forces (French: Forces Armées Nationales Cambodgiennes – FANC). At this stage the FANC consisted of ground forces only, although plans were being laid by the French for the creation in a foreseeable future of Air and Naval components. On 9 November 1953, the Kingdom of Cambodia officially proclaimed its independence from France. Meanwhile, the expansion of the newly created FANC continued with the addition that same month of two new light infantry battalions, the 9th BCK raised in Svay Rieng and the 10th BCK at Prey Veng. The Kingdom of Cambodia was granted full independence on 20 November and King Sihanouk officially took command of the 17,000-strong FANC, though France maintained the right to station CEFEO units in north-eastern Cambodia to guard its communications links with Tonkin.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 13. In early 1954, the \\"Khmerization\\" of the FANC units still under the command of French officers and NCOs began to be implemented, with most of these cadres assuming the roles of technical advisors or instructors, while others kept their posts in the various unit headquarters' staffs and technical branch services. However, due to the lack of a clear development plan for the FANC, and to compensate for the shortages of trained officers, its officer corps was expanded by replacing the departing French cadres with poorly-trained Khmer reserve officers, who were simply incorporated into the active duty officers' and NCO corps. Certain Khmer reserve officers were placed in the territorial commands, while the upper echelons of command were filled by Khmer senior civil servants hastily commissioned as military officers, whose grade was based on their civilian rank. In this system, a provincial governor or the president of a tribunal could become a Lieutenant colonel or Colonel without having ever received military training of any sort.Sutsakhan, The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse (1980), p. 36. The FANC continued to expand in the following months to accommodate new ground units and branches of service. An autonomous Cambodian armored battalion (French: Bataillon Blindée Cambodgien – BBC) was set up by the French, equipped with US armored cars, half-tracks and scout cars,Grandolini, Armor of the Vietnam War (2): Asian Forces (1998), p. 11. and a naval and riverine service, the Royal Khmer Navy (French: Marine Royale Khmère – MRK) was officially established on 1 March. By April 1954, the FANC consisted of ground and naval branches, with the former reverting to its original designation of Khmer Royal Army (ARK). The neutrality years 1964–1970 In response to the coup against President Ngô Đình Diệm in South Vietnam, Prince Sihanouk cancelled on 20 November 1963 all American aid, and on 15 January 1964 the US MAAG aid program was suspended when Cambodia adopted a neutrality policy.Chinnery, The rise of the Eagle Flights in Vietnam, the air war over south-east Asia (2016), p. 26. The ARK continued to rely on French military assistance but at the same time turned to the Soviet Union, China, Czechoslovakia, Britain, Belgium, and West Germany for weapons, equipment and training. Pre-1970 organization By January 1970, the Royal Khmer Army stood at about 35,000 Officers and enlisted men and women, organized according to the French Army modelSutsakhan, The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse (1980), p. 32. into 53 regiments (actually, battalions) and 13–15 regional independent companies; slightly over half were designated infantry battalions (French: Bataillons d'Infanterie), and the remainder light infantry battalions (French: Bataillons de Chasseurs) and border commando battalions (French: Bataillons Commando). Elite troops and some support units, including the Khmer Royal Guard (French: Garde Royale Khmère), Phnom Penh garrison, Airborne troops (French: Parachutistes or Troupes Aeroportées), Signals (French: Transmissions), Engineers (French: Génie), Artillery (French: Artillerie), Anti-Aircraft (French: Defense Antiaérienne), and Transport (French: Train or Transport) were organized into six larger formations termed Half-Brigades (French: Demi-Brigades). Other technical branch services such as Medical (French: Service de Santé, or simply Santé), Military logistics (French: Service de Matériel), Ordnance (French: Munitions), Military Fuel/Petrol, Oil and Lubricants – POL (French: Service de Essence), Quartermaster (French: Service de Intendance), Military Police (French: Prevôtée Militaire or Police Militaire – PM), Military Justice (French: Justice Militaire), Social and Cultural Services (French: Services Sociales et Culturelles), Geographic Services (French: Service Geographique), and Veterinary Services (French: Service Vétérinaire) were placed under the responsibility of the Service Directorates subordinated to the Ministry of National Defense. Cambodia was divided since September 1969 into seven military districts termed \\"Military Regions\\" – MRs () encompassing one to ten military sub-districts () of unequal size roughly corresponding to the areas of the country's 23 provinces and districts. They comprised the 1st MR (), 2nd MR (), 3rd MR (), 4th MR (), 5th MR (), and 6th MR ().Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces 1970–1975 (2011), p. 19. Most ARK units were concentrated in the northeast at Ratanakiri Province and on the Phnom Penh area; the latter was the headquarters of the six main Half-Brigades and supporting services whereas infantry formations were deployed throughout the country. The small armoured corps was also organized into an Armoured Half- Brigade (French: Demi-Brigade Blindée Khmère) consisting of two independent tank battalions – one stationed at Phnom Penh and the other at Kampong Cham – and an armoured reconnaissance regiment, 1st ARR (French: 1re Régiment de Reconnaissance Blindée) at Sre Khlong in Kampong Speu Province. Although a sizeable reserve cadre of trained Officers and NCOs did existed, there was a persistent lack of reserve units. Some units were posted to the General reserve forces, which consisted merely of the Phnom Penh garrison troops – a half-brigade made of two light infantry battalions – and the combat support units (signals, engineers, armoured, and artillery half-brigades).Sutsakhan, The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse (1980), p. 33. Weapons and equipment With the exception of a few specialized units, most of these formations actually fell below strength, were poorly trained and equipped in a haphazard way with an array of French, American, British, Belgian, West German, Czechoslovakian, Chinese, and Soviet weapon systems.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), pp. 3; 18. During the First Indochina War, ARK Infantry battalions were issued with WWII-vintage MAS-36, M1903 Springfield,Thompson, The M1903 Springfield Rifle (2013), p. 63. and Lee–Enfield bolt-action rifles, along with Sten, M1A1 Thompson, and MAT-49 submachine guns; FM 24/29, Bren, and M1918A2 BAR light machine guns were used as squad weapons. Officers and NCOs received MAS-35-S, FN P35 or Colt.45 M1911A1 pistols. In September 1950, the ARK began the process of standardisation on US equipment, with infantry and airborne units taking delivery of the M1 Garand semi-automatic rifle, the M1/M2 Carbine (airborne units received the semi-automatic M1A1 paratrooper carbine), and the M3A1 Grease Gun, followed by the Browning M1919A4 .30 Cal Medium machine gun and Browning M2HB .50 Cal Heavy machine gun. After US military assistance was renounced in 1964, the ARK received from China, the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries substantial numbers of the SKS semi-automatic rifle, Vz. 58 assault rifle, AK-47 assault rifle,Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 38. DP light machine gun, RPD light machine gun, SG-43/SGM Goryunov medium machine gun, and RPG-2 and RPG-7 anti-tank rocket launchers. In addition, limited quantities of FN FAL and Heckler & Koch G3 assault rifles were reportedly acquired from Belgium and West Germany, but they were never adopted as standard weapons. ARK infantry and airborne formations were also equipped with crew-served weapons such as Brandt mle 27/31 81mm and M2 4.2-inch (107mm) Mortars. The armoured corps inventory consisted of thirty-six M24 Chaffee light tanks,Zaloga and Laurier, M24 Chaffee Light Tank 1943–85 (2003), p. 22. forty AMX-13 light tanks, and some M8 HMC 75mm self-propelled Howitzers; reconnaissance squadrons were provided with five M8 Greyhound light armoured cars, fifteen M20 Armoured Utility Cars, fifteen Panhard AML-60 and AML-90 armoured cars. Mechanized infantry battalions were issued with M2 half-track cars, M3 Half-Tracks, fifteen M3A1 Scout Cars, BTR-40 and thirty BTR-152 armoured personnel carriers (APC).Grandolini, Armor of the Vietnam War (2): Asian Forces (1998), pp. 11–12.SIPRI Arms Transfers Database The artillery corps fielded M101A1 105mm towed field howitzers, twelve Soviet M-30 122mm howitzers, twenty Soviet BM-13 132mm and ten BM-14 140mm MBRLs. Air Defense units were equipped with British- made Bofors 40mm L/60 anti-aircraft guns, twenty-seven Soviet AZP S-60 57mm anti-aircraft guns, Chinese Type 55/65 37mm anti-aircraft guns,Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), pp. 263; 268–269. and eight Soviet KS-19 100mm air defense guns. Logistics were the responsibility of the transport corps, equipped with a variety of liaison and transportation vehicles. The motor pool consisted in a mixed inventory totalling 150 vehicles, including WWII-vintage US Willys MB ¼-ton (4x4) jeeps, Land Rover (4x4) Series II, Soviet GAZ-69A (4x4) light trucks and GAZ-63 (4x4) 2-ton trucks.Grandolini, Armor of the Vietnam War (2): Asian Forces (1998), p. 25. Heavier transport vehicles ranged from ex-French Army WWII-vintage US GMC CCKW 2½ ton (6x6) and Chevrolet G506 1½ ton (4x4) trucks to Chinese Yuejin NJ-130 2.5 ton (4x2) trucks and Jiefang CA-30 general purpose 2.5 ton (6x6) trucks. Expansion 1970–71 Following the March 1970 coup, the new Head of State Marshal Lon Nol issued a general mobilization order and, after securing American, Thai and South Vietnamese military support, promptly set up ambitious plans to expand the Cambodian armed forces. Shortly after the coup, however, China and the Soviet Union severed their military assistance programs, and the French military mission suspended all cooperation with Cambodia, thus depriving its Army of vital training and technical assistance. By June 1970, the rechristened Khmer National Army (French: Armée Nationale Khmère – ANK), had rapidly expanded to 110,000 men and women, though most of them were untrained raw recruits organized into a confusing array of French- and American-modelled combat formations, staffed by elderly NCOs and inexperienced young officers. At the same time, there were several changes regarding field organization. Regular infantry battalions were at first amalgamated into autonomous regiments (French: Régiments d’Infanterie Autonomes – RIA), soon abolished in favour of a brigade grouping several battalions. By early May 1970, eighteen new Infantry Brigades (French: Brigades d’Infanterie – BI) had been created, but only twelve – the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th Inf. Bdes – were properly manned, the other six – 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Inf. Bdes – were never brought to strength or remained on paper. From mid-1970, Infantry units began to be formed into larger 15 Brigade Groups (French: Groupments Brigades d’Infanterie – GBI), each comprising two brigades and roughly the size of a Division, but lacking support units. Of these, only three were military effective by January 1972, other three were still undergoing training, and the remaining nine were only marginally reliable.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), pp. 9–10.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 14. The Artillery, Signals, Engineer, Transport, and Armoured Half-Brigades were also brought to brigade strength, with the latter becoming the 1st Khmer Armoured Brigade (1st Arm. Bde, 1re Brigade Blindée Khmère in French).Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), pp. 193–195.Grandolini, Armor of the Vietnam War (2): Asian Forces (1998), p. 10. Re-organization 1972–73 To streamline the mass of ground forces' combat formations, a major reshuffle was implemented between July and December 1972 along American lines. The old organizational structure modelled after the French Army was abandoned in favour of a modern conventional organization based on the US Army model. By January 1973, all brigade group headquarters (HQs), 17 regimental HQs, 16 brigade HQs, and 13 battalions had been dissolved, replaced by newly created 32 infantry brigades, 202 infantry battalions, and 465 territorial infantry companies. Out of these totals, 128 battalions formed the maneuver elements for the 32 brigades, of which 20 would remain independent and 12 were to be distributed among new four Mechanized Infantry Divisions (French: Divisions d’Infanterie) created from existing Brigade Groups: *1st Infantry Division (French: 1re Division d'Infanterie) *2nd Infantry Division (French: 2éme Division d'Infanterie) *3rd Infantry Division (French: 3éme Division d'Infanterie) *7th Infantry Division (French: 7éme Division d'Infanterie) A fifth division, the understrength 9th Guards Division was later raised in April 1974. The Armour, Artillery, Signals, Transport, and Engineer arms were left untouched by this reorganization and retained their separate brigade structure under their own commands. The General Reserve was also reorganized by Marshal Lon Nol in April 1972 by sub- dividing it into three groups: the Forces A, attached to a MR for combat operations; Forces B, the General Staff reserve comprising five brigades; and Forces C, two airborne battalions under the personal command of Lon Nol.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), pp. 14–15. The ANK order-of- battle by mid-1973 consisted of four infantry divisions, nine independent infantry brigades, two airborne brigades (one of which was never brought to strength, and was disbanded that same year),Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 36. one armored brigade, one Lake Brigade, one battalion-sized Special Forces unit, five support services' brigades, 15 regional infantry brigades attached to the Military Regions (MR), and one air defense half-brigade. Territorial units included 58 infantry battalions assigned to each of the military sub-districts within the larger MRs, 529 independent infantry companies, and 76 field artillery batteries.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), p. 75. Weapons and equipment 1970–75 Cambodian army strength stood at 220,000–230,000 troops on paper by mid-1972, but is estimated that the actual number was no less than 150,000, armed by the United States with US$1.18 billion-worth of weaponry and equipment.http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-2224.html Its inventory included 241,630 rifles, 7,079 machine guns, 2,726 mortars, 20,481 grenade launchers, 304 recoilless rifles, 289 howitzers, 202 M113 armoured personnel carriers (including seventeen M106 mortar carriers equipped with a 107mm heavy mortar) and 4,316 trucks.Sutsakhan, The Khmer Republic at War and the Final Collapse (1980), p. 182, Appendix C (Army Item). In the early months of the War, most Cambodian infantry units fought the People's Army of Vietnam and Khmer Rouge with a mix of surplus World War II-vintage French and U.S. and modern Soviet and Chinese infantry weapons either inherited from Khmer Royal Army stocks or delivered as emergency aid by the Americans.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 11. ANK infantry battalions later sent to South Vietnam for retraining between February 1971 and November 1972 under the US Army-Vietnam Individual Training Program (UITG) were issued Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolvers, Colt.45 M1911A1 and Smith & Wesson Model 39 pistols, M16A1 assault rifles, M1918A2 BAR light machine guns, Browning M1919A4 .30 Cal medium machine guns, Browning M2HB .50 Cal heavy machine guns, M79 grenade launchers,Rottman, US Grenade Launchers – M79, M203, and M320 (2017), p. 20. M72 LAW Anti-tank rocket launchers, M19 60mm and M29 81mm mortars and M40A1 106mm recoilless rifles.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 42, Plate B3. Limited quantities of the CAR-15 carbine, the M60 machine gun and the M203 grenade launcher were also provided to the ANK, eventually finding their way into Cambodian elite troops, such as the Khmer Special Forces and the Recondo companies.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 46, Plate G2. Although the UITG and MEDTC aid programmes allowed the ANK to standardise on modern U.S. weapons, they never superseded entirely the earlier weaponry, particularly in the case of the territorial units and rear-echelon support formations. In October 1970, the ANK command sought to expand its armoured corps but, despite repeated requests for the delivery of more modern M41 Walker Bulldog light tanks and M-706 armoured cars, their requests were declined by Washington.Grandolini, Armor of the Vietnam War (2): Asian Forces (1998), p. 29. Thus Cambodian armoured units continued to rely on their ageing fleet of US M24 and French AMX-13 light tanks and M8, M20 and AML armoured cars until 1974, when mounting combat losses and maintenance problems forced the withdrawal of most of these vehicles (in particular the French ones, after France placed a spare parts embargo) from frontline service,Grandolini, Armor of the Vietnam War (2): Asian Forces (1998), pp. 30; 65. being gradually replaced by M113 APCs. The ANK also received after 1970 a new influx of much-needed softskin transport and liaison vehicles. Early in the War, the Army Command was confronted with a serious logistical problem – the small number of outdated US, Soviet, and Chinese military trucks available from its transport corps soon proved insufficient to carry the increasing number of troops mobilized, let alone resupplying them over long distances. To remedy the inequities of its transportation system during the first year of the War, Army field commanders resorted to commandeering civilian buses and other commercial vehicles to get their troops to the front.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), p. 181. In 1971–72, the transport corps was re- organized and expanded with the help of the US and Australia, who provided 350 M151A1 ¼-ton (4x4) utility trucks (a number of which were converted into makeshift armoured cars for security and convoy escort duties), Dodge M37 ¾-ton (4x4) 1953 utility trucks, and M35A1 2½-ton (6x6) cargo trucks, followed by 300 militarized GMC/Chevrolet C-50 medium-duty commercial trucks assembled in Australian plants.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), pp. 130; 264. The Artillery Corps was also re-structured under US lines in 1972–73, receiving additional twenty-five M101A1 105mm towed field howitzers, ten M114A1 155mm towed field howitzers and eight tracked M109 155mm self-propelled guns, meant to replace the Soviet artillery pieces gradually withdrawn from service due to a lack of spare parts and ammunition. ==Elite Forces== *Cambodian Airborne Brigade *Para-Commando Battalion *Khmer Special Forces *Lake Brigade ==Combat history== Final operations 1974–75 On 17 April 1975 the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh, bringing the Cambodian Civil War to an end. Long Boret, Lon Non and other FANK senior staff officers and top officials of the Khmer Republic government were summarily executed without trial at the Cércle Sportive complex, while Army troops in the city were disarmed, being subsequently taken to the Olympic Stadium and executed as well.Becker, When the War was over Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution (1988), p. 160. The same fate befell on the remaining Cambodian Army units and garrisons still holding on to the provincial capitals and some key towns. Throughout the country, thousands of demoralized Cambodian men and women who had the misfortune of being captured wearing the Army uniform – ranging from officers to NCOs, and even ordinary soldiers, regardless if they had committed any war crimes or not – were rounded up by Khmer Rouge guerrilla units and massacred. In Phnom Penh and elsewhere, some officers and enlisted men narrowly avoided capture by quickly changing to civilian clothes and went into hiding. While scores of surrendering Cambodian soldiers were simply shot by firing squad and had their bodies dumped into shallow graves dug in forest areas, a considerable number of them were sent to be 're-educated' in the new labor camps (best known as the \\"Killing Fields\\") promptly set up by the Khmer Rouge shortly after their victory, where they were forced to endure the camps' terrible living and working conditions until the 1978–79 Cambodian–Vietnamese War. Only a few Army personnel in April–May 1975 escaped by foot or by vehicle across the border into Thailand, where in the late 1970s they would provide the founding cadre for the anti-Vietnamese Sihanoukist National Army (ANS) and Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) guerrilla forces. ==Cambodian Army uniforms and insignia== The Cambodian Army owed its origin and traditions to the Khmer colonial ARK and CEFEO troops on French service of the First Indochina War, and even after the United States took the role as the main foreign sponsor for the Khmer National Armed Forces at the beginning of the 1970s, French military influence was still perceptible in their uniforms and insignia. Service dress and field uniforms The basic Royal Cambodian Army (ARK) work uniform for all-ranks was a local copy of the French Army's tropical working dress (French: Tenue de toile kaki clair Mle 1945), consisting of a light khaki cotton shirt and pants modelled after the WWII US Army tropical \\"Chino\\" khaki working dress. The M1945 shirt had a six-buttoned front, two patch breast pockets closed by clip-cornered straight flaps and shoulder straps (French: Epaulettes) whilst the M1945 \\"Chino\\" pants featured two pleats at the front hips. In alternative, the short-sleeved M1946 (French: Chemisette kaki clair Mle 1946), which featured two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps or the \\"Chino\\"-style M1949 (French: Chemisette kaki clair Mle 1949) shirts could be worn; a long-sleeved version also existed, based on the French M1948 shirt (French: Chemise kaki clair Mle 1948).Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), p. 15. Shorts (French: Culotte courte kaki clair Mle 1946) were also issued and worn according to weather conditions. In the field, Cambodian officers and enlisted men wore French all-arms M1947 drab green fatigues (French: Treillis de combat Mle 1947).Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), pp. 38–39, Plate A1. ARK Officers received the standard FARK summer service dress uniform in khaki cotton, which was patterned after the French Army M1946/56 khaki dress uniform (); for formal occasions, a light summer version in white cotton (which was the standard FARK full dress uniform) was also issued. The open- collar jacket had two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps and two unpleated at the side closed by straight ones whilst the sleeves had false turnbacks; the front fly and pocket flaps were secured by gilt buttons. The uniform was worn with a matching Khaki shirt and black tie on service dress whereas the white version was worn with a white shirt and a black tie instead. After March 1970, as part of the US-sponsored MAP re-equipment program, the Cambodian Army (ANK) was supplied with new American olive green tropical uniforms, the US Army OG-107 utilities and the M1967 Jungle Utility Uniform which quickly replaced the older ARK khaki working uniform and the drab green French fatigue clothing.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 18. As with the ARVN, the Cambodians soon produced their own interesting variety of versions of these jungle utilities or had tailors to modify them to suit their tastes and needs, with mix-and-match combinations being far from uncommon. It was not infrequent to see Cambodian male and female soldiers wearing an OG-107 shirt accompanied by a pair of M1967 Jungle Utility trousers or vice versa.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), pp. 18 and 25. The OG-107 trousers were often converted by the addition of cargo pouches; shirts and jackets had their sleeves cut at elbow level, shoulder straps were added, single-buttoned pocket flaps could be replaced by two-button versions (with either clip or round corners) or concealed ones, and – a common practice for officers – the addition of a shoulder pocket on the upper left sleeve for ballpoint pens, which were the symbol of authority in Indo-Chinese armed forces.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 45, Plate F3. Sometimes fatigue shirts were converted into light bush jackets by adding two- buttoned patch pockets on the lower skirt.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 11. Olive green US M-1951 field jackets were also issued to all-ranks. Reflecting the increasing American influence, ANK senior officers adopted in 1970–71 a new dress uniform, which consisted of an Olive Green tunic and slacks worn with a white shirt and black tie. The cut of the four-buttoned tunic was a hybrid design resembling both the US Army M-1954 \\"Class A\\" green dress and the earlier French-style M1946/56 khaki dress; it had two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps and two unpleated at the side closed by straight ones whilst the sleeves had false turnbacks. The front fly and pocket flaps were secured by gilt buttons bearing the combined service emblem of the FANK General Headquarters.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 44, Plate E3. Female personnel were issued a service and working olive green OG-107-style short-sleeved blouse based on their male counterparts' versions, provided with two patch breast pockets closed by straight or pointed flaps and shoulder straps. The blouse was worn with a matching service and working olive green knee-length skirt.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), p. 248. Camouflage uniforms French \\"Lizard\\" (French: Ténue Leopard) camouflage M1947/51, M1947/52 and M1947/53-54 TAP jump-smocks and M1947/52 TTA vests with matching trousers were issued to ARK airborne troops since the 1950s, though later shortages in the early 1970s limited its use to officers and NCOs only. Enlisted-rank paratroopers received a locally produced spotted camouflage uniform (known as the \\"Spot pattern\\") during the 1960s, which consisted of olive green and russet blotches on a pale green background. After 1970, \\"Highland\\" (ERDL 1948 Leaf pattern or \\"Woodland\\") and Tigerstripe patterns of US, Thailand (Thai Tadpole), and South Vietnamese (Tadpole Sparse) origin were also provided to the ANK. Cambodian students that attended the Para-Commando course at the Batujajar Airborne Commando School, near Bandung in Indonesia between March–November 1972, received the Indonesian Army's \\"flowing blood\\" (Indonesian language: Loreng Darah Mangalir) camouflage fatigues.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 46, Plate G3. Headgear The most common headgear for ARK/ANK all-ranks was a lightweight beret made of light khaki cotton cloth surnamed the \\"gourka\\", adopted by the French Army as the M1946 (French: Bérét de toile kaki clair Mle 1946) during the First Indochina War, who copied it from a tropical beret pattern previously worn by British troops in the Far East during WWII.Dutrône and Roques, L'Escadron Parachutiste de la Garde Sud-Vietnam, 1947–1951 (2001), p. 14, photo caption 1. Berets were worn pulled to the left in French fashion, with the colour sequence as follows: General Service – Light Khaki, Infantry – Light Olive Drab, Armoured Corps – Black, Paratroopers and Para-Commandos – Cherry-red (Maroon), Special Forces – Forest Green, Military Police and Regional Gendarmerie – Dark Blue; berets made of \\"Tigerstripe\\" and \\"Highland\\" camouflage cloth were also issued to elite units. With the exception of the light khaki and camouflage versions – which were manufactured in three pieces –, all other corps' berets were made of wool in a single piece attached to a black (or tan) leather rim provided with two black tightening straps at the back, following the French M1946 (French: Bérét Mle 1946) or M1953/59 models (French: Bérét Mle 1953/59). French M1946 and M1957 light khaki sidecaps (French: Bonnet de police de toile kaki clair Mle 1946 and Bonnet de police de toile kaki clair Mle 1957) were also adopted by the ARK, but seldom used. ARK officers received a light khaki service peaked cap based on the French M1927 pattern (French: Casquette d'officier Mle 1927) to wear with the khaki service dress, whilst a white summer top version was worn with the FARK white full dress uniform. After March 1970 these caps were replaced by an Olive Green version – incidentally, the change of colour made it to resemble more the US M1954 Visor Cap – for wear with the new Americanized dress uniform adopted by the ANK. An olive green sidecap was adopted by female personnel to wear with their Olive Green service and working uniform. In the field, ARK officers and enlisted men wore a mixture of light khaki tropical berets, US M-1951 cotton field caps, French M1949 bush hats (French: Chapeau de brousse Mle 1949) and privately purchased civilian sun hats in white, Khaki or OG cotton cloth. Later, a khaki patrol cap resembling a simplified baseball cap version was adopted as the standard ANK fatigue headgear for all-ranks, though the South Vietnamese ARVN fatigue cap in OG cotton cloth, whose shape recalled the US Marines utility cap, was sometimes seen.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), p. 278. In addition, a wide range of OG or camouflage jungle hats and baseball caps also found their way into the ANK from the US, South Vietnam and Thailand though they never displaced entirely the earlier headgear. Period photos do show that the old French bush hat remained popular with the troops, who also wore Cambodian- or South Vietnamese-made versions in camouflage cloth. Steel helmets, in the form of the US M-1 and French M1951 NATO () models were standard issue in the ARK, with paratroopers receiving either the US M-1C jump helmet and its respective French-modified versions (French: Casque USM1 TAP type Métropole and Casque USM1 TAP type EO) or the French M1951 TAP variant (French: Casque type TAP, modéle 1951).Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), p. 182. During the Republic, the ANK standardized on the M-1 model 1964 provided with the US Army Mitchell \\"Clouds\\" camouflage pattern cover, though some units retained the older US and French steel helmets throughout the war. ARK armoured crews received the French M1951 and M1958/65 dark olive green leather crash helmets (French: Sous-casque radio-char modéle 1951, Sous- casque radio-char modéle 1958 and Sous-casque radio-char modéle 1965); after 1970, Cambodian M113 APC crewmen were issued the US Combat Vehicle Crew (CVC) fibreglass \\"bone dome\\" helmet, though neither models offered any satisfactory protection against shrapnel or small arms rounds. Footwear White low laced leather shoes were worn with the FARK white cotton full dress, with brown shoes being prescribed to wear with the khaki working uniform, and later, black ones with the new ANK OG dress uniform. On the field, all Army personnel wore brown leather US M-1943 Combat Service Boots and French M1953 \\"Rangers\\" (French: Rangers modéle 1953) or French canvas-and-rubber Pataugas tropical boots, and sandals; paratroopers received the calf-length French M1950 or M1950/53 TAP (French: Bottes de saut modéle 1950 et 1950/53) black leather jump-boot models. After 1970, the ANK standardized on the American black leather M-1967 model with \\"ripple\\" pattern rubbler sole and Jungle boots, and South Vietnamese Bata tropical boots, which replaced much of the older combat footwear. Army Ranks In deep contrast to the South Vietnamese ARVN and Laotian FAR, who replaced the French-style military ranks previously worn during the colonial period with their own devised rank insignia after 1954, the standard FARK rank chart continued to follow closely the French pattern. The Cambodian Armed Forces' system of military ranks was almost identical to the sequence laid out by the French Army 1956 regulationsGaujac, Officiers et soldats de l'armée française d'après le TTA 148 (1943–1956) (2011), pp. 38–45. and common to all branches of service, differing only in some details. Removable stiffened shoulder boards (French: pattes d'épaule) were worn by officers on their dress uniforms as per in the French practice, except that Cambodian Generals’ (French: Officiers géneraux) wore their stars above gold laurel-like leaf embroidery on the outer edge, and a miniature royal coat-of-arms featuring a combined crown-and-crossed spears device was incorporated on the inner end of the shoulder boards for all- ranks.Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), p. 19. The colour sequence of the FARK shoulder boards also varied according to the arm of service: general service – very dark blue or black; airborne troops – light green; medical corps – maroon. On both the khaki working and olive green (OG) field uniforms, Generals' and senior officers' ranks (French: Officiers supérieures) were usually worn on shoulder strap slides (French: passants d'épaule) but, if the issued combat jacket or shirt was not provided with buttoned shoulder straps, a single chest tab (French: patte de poitrine) pinned to the front fly following French practice could be worn instead.Lassus, Les marques de grade de l'armée française, 1945–1990 (1er partie-introduction) (1998), pp. 12–15. As for senior (French: Officiers subalternes) and junior NCOs (French: Sous-officiers), they wore metal or cloth chevrons pinned to the chest;Conboy and Bowra, The War in Cambodia 1970–75 (1989), pp. 5–6.Lassus, Les marques de grade de l'armée française, 1945–1990 (2e partie-les differents types de galons) (1998), pp. 54–58. NCOs serving in combat units were entitled to wear their chevrons pointed upwards whereas their counterparts assigned to non-combatant, rear-echelon support formations had to wear their chevrons pointed downwards.Conboy, FANK: A History of the Cambodian Armed Forces, 1970–1975 (2011), pp. 268; 281. Privates (French: Hommes de troupe) wore no insignia. This basic system was maintained during the Republic, though standard black shoulder boards without the royal crest were adopted in 1970 for all services and from 1972 onwards some Cambodian officers began wearing metal pin-on collar rank insignia, obviously inspired by American practice. Although the system of military ranks remained unchanged, the rank of Field Marshal (French: Maréchal) was created in 1970 for the President of the Khmer Republic and FANK Commander-in-Chief Lon Nol. {  - !ANK Ranks !Khmer language !French Army ranks !US Army ranks !Insignia - Pʊəl too ពលទោ Soldat de deuxième classe Soldier 2nd Class/Private (no insignia) - Pʊəl aek ពលឯក Soldat de première classe Private 1st Class 50px - Niey too នាយទោ Caporal Lance- Corporal 50px - Niey aek នាយឯក Caporal-chef Corporal 50px - Pʊəl baal trəy ពលបាលត្រី Sergent Staff Sergeant 50px - Pʊəl baal too ពលបាលទោ Sergent-chef Master Sergeant 50px - Pʊəl baal aek ពលបាលឯក Adjudant Warrant Officer 50px - Prɨn baal too ព្រឹន្ទបាលទោ Adjudant-chef Chief Warrant Officer 50px - Prɨn baal aek ព្រឹន្ទបាលឯក Aspirant Aspirant 50px - Aknu trəy អនុត្រី Sous-lieutenant 2nd Lieutenant 50px - Aknu too អនុទោ Lieutenant 1st Lieutenant 50px - Aknu aek អនុឯក Capitaine Captain 50px - Vorak trəy វរត្រី Commandant Major 50px - Vorak too វរទោ Lieutenant-Colonel Lieutenant Colonel 50px - Vorak aek វរឯក Colonel Colonel 50px - Utdɑm trəy ឧត្តមត្រី Général de brigade Brigadier General 50px - Utdɑm too ឧត្តមទោ Major Général Major General 50px - Utdɑm aek ឧត្តមឯក Lieutenant Général Lieutenant General 50px - Utdɑm nieyʊək ឧត្តមនាយក Général General 50px - Senabramoukh សេនាប្រមុខ Maréchal Field Marshal (six gold stars in circle) } Branch insignia ARK skill and trade badges came in gilt metal and/or ennamelled pin-on versions, with cloth embroidered yellow or black-on-green subdued variants being introduced after 1970. On dress and service uniforms, they were worn on both collars by all-ranks if shoulder boards were worn, but in the field officers did not wore them on the shirt collars if metal pin-on collar rank insignia was being worn; enlisted ranks usually wore branch insignia on both collars. Unit insignia Full-color and subdued nametapes were occasionally worn above the right shirt or jacket pocket on field dress; plastic nameplates were worn with the service and dress uniforms. == See also == * Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) * Cambodian Civil War * Civilian Irregular Defense Group program * Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Armed Forces * Khmer Republic * Khmer Rouge * Khmer Krom * Khmer Serei * Operation Chenla I * Operation Chenla II * Royal Cambodian Armed Forces * Royal Cambodian Army * Royal Gendarmerie of Cambodia * Royal Lao Armed Forces * Weapons of the Cambodian Civil War ==NotesReferences== *Albert Grandolini, Armor of the Vietnam War (2): Asian Forces, Concord Publications, Hong Kong 1998. *Arnold Issacs, Gordon Hardy, MacAlister Brown, et al., Pawns of War: Cambodia and Laos, Boston Publishing Company, Boston 1987.

A member of the Gracie family, he is the grandson of Grandmaster Hélio Gracie, and the second-eldest son of Grandmaster Rorion Gracie, who was among some of the first family members to bring Gracie jiu-jitsu to the United States along with Carley Gracie, and Carlson Gracie. Rener is the husband of actress, model and former pro-wrestler Eve Torres. Rener has spent over twenty-five years at the Gracie Academy studying under Rorion and Helio Gracie. Rener and his brother, Ryron Gracie created Gracie University, an online martial arts learning center, and developed distance learning packages for their proprietary courses. He is also the founder and CEO of Quikflip Apparel, a clothing company that specializes in garments that convert into backpacks. Quikflip was featured on ABC's Shark Tank and Time Magazine listed it as one of the \\"Best Inventions of 2019.\\" ==Early life and education== Rener was born on November 10, 1983, to Rorion and Suzanne Gracie. He has one older brother, Ryron Gracie, and two younger brothers, Ralek Gracie and Reylan, as well as one younger sister, Segina. He also has two half-sisters, Rose and Riane Gracie, from his father's first marriage, and three half-brothers, Roran, Renon, and Ricon, from his father's third marriage. Rener received his black belt in 2002 from his grandfather, Grand Master Helio Gracie. ==Competitive career== Rener competed in the 2003 Pan American Jiu-Jitsu Championship and took 3rd place. Later that year, Rener participated in the first Southern California Pro-Am Invitational, a 16-man single elimination tournament with no time limits. Rener was the only one of 16 competitors to wear a gi. He won first place submitting all four of his opponents. His opponents were Joe Stevenson (UFC Fighter), Cassio Werneck (BJJ World Champion), Jason \\"Mayhem\\" Miller (UFC Fighter), and Tyrone Glover. In 2004, Rener retired from point- based sport jiu-jitsu competition to focus on the street self-defense aspect of jiu-jitsu. ==Gracie University== Rener is best known for his abilities as a Gracie jiu-jitsu instructor and his role in popularizing jiu-jitsu using web- based distance learning programs. He started teaching Gracie jiu-jitsu when he was 13 years old and six years later assumed head instructor duty at the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy with his brother, Ryron. He and his brother oversaw all aspects of training and program development within an enterprise consisting of resident training at the World Headquarters in Torrance, California along with an additional location in Beverly Hills, California, which opened its doors on June 4, 2012. They also have a global network of Certified Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Training Centers, extension training through the web-based Gracie University and DVDs, and on-site training for law enforcement and military personnel. The brothers completely revamped pre-existing Gracie Academy programs developed by their father and created several new ones to facilitate the export of their instruction through distance education and cadre training. In 2017, they moved to a larger facility in Torrance to accommodate the worldwide expansion of Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and rebranded as “Gracie University” to reflect the shift from a single academy to a global organization. ==Gracie Breakdown== The brothers use YouTube to popularize Gracie jiu-jitsu through segments such as “The Gracie Way” and “The Gracie Breakdown”, which are commentaries on mixed martial arts bouts and real-life self-defense situations in which the brothers explain the techniques and strategies employed, or what could have been done better. Ryron and Rener's video analysis of a match between Fabrício Werdum and Fedor Emelianenko was one of YouTube's top viewed videos on June 28, 2010 with over 100,000 views in 24 hours. Gracie breakdowns are now featured on UFC's weekly show 'UFC Ultimate Insider. ==Quikflip Apparel== Gracie is the founder of Quikflip Apparel. Time Magazine selected Quikflip as one of the \\"Best Inventions of 2019.\\" ==Personal life== Rener married his longtime partner, Eve Torres, in Santa Barbara, California on April 13, 2014. Eve is a purple belt in Gracie Jiu-Jitsu and currently works as a spokeswoman and head instructor for the Gracie Women Empowered Self-defense program. During the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, Rener caught the virus before recovering quickly and having several negative tests. He then tested positive for a second time on October 10, 2020, and was forced to withdraw from cornering his fighter, Brian Ortega, at a UFC event in Abu Dhabi.Rener Gracie tests positive for coronavirus again Ortega won the fight. ==Instructor lineage== Kanō Jigorō → Tomita Tsunejirō → Mitsuyo \\"Count Koma\\" Maeda → Carlos Gracie → Helio Gracie → Rorion Gracie → Rener Gracie == References  External links == * Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy * Gracie University * Gracie Kids Category:1983 births Category:American people of Brazilian descent Category:American people of Scottish descent Category:American practitioners of Brazilian jiu-jitsu Category:Brazilian people of Scottish descent Rener Category:Living people ","title":"Rener Gracie"},{"id":"35293596","text":", shortened to , is a Japanese light novel series written by Pan Tachibana and illustrated by Yoshiaki Katsurai.

A manga adaptation illustrated by Shou Okagiri began serialization in the May 2011 issue of Monthly Dragon Age, and released five volumes as of December 9, 2013. A 12-episode anime adaptation produced by Feel was announced, and aired from July to September 2012 on AT-X and other networks. The anime series was licensed by Sentai Filmworks in 2013 for distribution in North America. Sentai Filmworks has released the series on DVD, Blu-ray Disc and for online streaming. ==Plot== One day, Ryosuke Kaga, a high school boy attending , meets a girl standing alone in the rain. Introducing herself as Lisara Restall, an elite Grim Reaper, she visited the human world in order to find \\"The Singular Man\\". Ryosuke makes a contract with Lisara, while sucking energy required for her activity in the human world from Ryosuke. The source of the energy is his lecherous spirit. To preserve his life, Ryosuke has no choice but to help in Lisara's search. ==Characters== Main characters ; : :Ryosuke is a second-year student at Momozomo Academy, who uses his lecherous life-energy to give Lisara energy. Also, he learns from Lisara that he will die in three months and in return for his help now, she will try to change his fate. Lisara uses the Broken Sword, Gram, which used to belong to the god of war, to form a contract with Ryosuke. However, it was revealed later that Ryosuke has the other half of Gram (which was thought to be lost), thus gaining full power of the sword. He falls in love with Lisara, and can only fully charge his lecherous spirit energy if he thinks of her body alone or with his \\"Invisible Dictionary\\". He lives on his own (until Lisara moved in) because his mother works overseas; his father died when he was 3 (his mother later reveals that his father isn't actually dead but that he disappeared). At the end of the anime, he and Lisara became a couple even though Lisara still feels uneasy about his lecherousness. ; : :The heroine of the story, a beautiful Grim Reaper who makes a deal with Ryosuke and uses his lecherous \\"spirit\\" for energy. She wields a scythe called , which channels the element of fire. She used the hilt of the Broken Sword Gram (belonging to the Restall family) to form a contract with Ryosuke. She falls in love with Ryosuke but does not show it, unlike the other girls. Her bust size is seventy-something cm. At the end of the anime, she and Ryosuke became a couple. ; : :Ryosuke's childhood best friend and currently Quele's partner. She developed a large bust early in her childhood and is now a 92 cm - G-cup. She has very strong feelings for Ryosuke as he protected her when they were children. She is aware of Ryosuke's lecherousness and it doesn't seem to bother her. Mina is untroubled when Lisara's true identity is revealed and lets Lisara continue her \\"business\\" with Ryosuke. She makes a contract with Quele so that she can help Ryosuke and her energy charge for Quele develops when she talks about him. ; : :Lisara's distant cousin and another Grim Reaper. She calls Lisara \\"Onee-sama\\" despite not being her sister. She makes a contract with Mina as her energy source, to both Ryosuke's and Lisara's dismay. In battle she wields a gladius called , which channels the element of ice. She falls in love with Ryosuke but later in the series, she pushes those feelings aside to support first Mina, then Lisara. ; : :Lisara's rival Grim Reaper during her school years at Grimwald, who is also a famous pop idol in the human world. Despite being 2nd in the school (Lisara being ranked top of her class), she has the biggest bust size of the main cast (92.5 cm - G-cup). However, her large breasts are revealed to be a result of infusing breast pads with magic, and her actual bust size is smaller than Lisara's. She wields a falchion named , which channels the element of lightning. She also claims to be in love with Ryosuke, but so far it only seems she likes him because of the energy he can create. She is also trying to find a Singular Person for herself (to level in rank) and for her employers. Instead of gaining energy from a contract with a person, she gains energy from the devotion of her fans. Momozomo Academy students and staff ; : :Ryosuke's classmate. ; : :The son of the headmaster. A narcissist. ; : :Ryosuke's classmate who has heterochromic eyes (Her left eye is blue and her right eye is red).

At a swanky hotel in a Black Sea resort, Gogu, one of the hotel employees, meets his uncle Marin, an Oltenian peasant who has come to visit. Gogu says he can sneak Marin into the hotel, as one of the rooms is empty awaiting the arrival of an American billionaire, Mr. Juvett. Marin is amazed by the revealing clothing worn by women at the resort, while the hotel guests are fascinated by his quaint peasant costume. In the hotel room, Marin is perplexed by the various gadgets. Meanwhile, the gangsters learn that Juvett has arrived at the hotel. Juvett is the father of the kidnapped girl, and is coming to pass over a million dollar ransom. A rival gang, who know about the kidnapping, plan to take the ransom for themselves. They follow Marin, believing him to be Juvett. When the real Juvett arrives, he is carrying a suitcase containing the ransom, which is identical to the one in which Marin carries his supply of leeks and cheese. He is also identical in appearance to Marin. The gangsters repeatedly mistake Marin for Juvett, while Juvett and Marin constantly exchange suitcases by mistake, leading to numerous farcical situations. Meanwhile, Juvett's daughter, Samantha, escapes from the kidnappers and tries to find her father. The two rival criminal gangs agree to team up, but in reality both plan to double-cross the other and take all the money. At the hotel, a mysterious American guest with a remarkable resemblance to Lt. Columbo keeps an eye on things.

Both the process whereby the nationalities and regions were to accede to self- government and the scope of competences that were to be devolved or transferred from the central government, were intended to be asymmetrical in nature. One of the main differences was established in the first additional provision of the constitution, after much debate in the Cortes Generales acting as a Constituent Assembly. This provision established a protection and respect for the historical rights of the territories that had fueros, \\"charters\\", \\"privileges\\" or \\"jurisdictions\\", which were to be \\"updated\\" within the framework of the constitution. These territories were Álava, Gipuzkoa, Biscay and Navarre. The first three joined to form the autonomous community of the Basque Country, whereas Navarre was constituted itself as the Chartered Community of Navarre. The charters that were recognized and updated grant them specific competences not recognized in other autonomous communities, most notably, fiscal autonomy. As such, these two autonomous communities are known as communities of chartered regime () as opposed to the rest of the autonomous communities without fiscal autonomy, which are known as communities of common regime. ==Background== Map of Spain in the 1850s, showing the different territories based on their regimes. The \\"Chartered Spain\\" is shown in blue, whereas the \\"Assimilated Spain\\" — regions whose charters had already been abolished — is shown in green. The rest of peninsular Spain, in orange, is shown as \\"Uniform Spain\\", whereas the overseas Spanish territories, \\"Colonial Spain\\", are shown in yellow. From the 12th to the 16th century, as the Kingdom of Castile expanded to the south or incorporated other kingdoms and territories into the Crown of Castile, which then became the Kingdom of Spain, the monarchy granted them certain privileges and jurisdictions, which were known as fueros, or \\"charters\\". The competences of the fueros at one point in time included the right to establish custom controls, have their own militias as well as some governing institutions, and to manage their civic and fiscal affairs, but these were progressively reduced or completely eliminated — as was the case for the former constituent kingdoms of the Crown of Aragon. The case of the Basque territories was unique, in that their fueros were the only to survive well into the 19th century, even if their scope was much reduced, whereas the fueros of other kingdoms and regions had already been abolished by then. During the 19th century, and in the several constitutions that were written, the monarchy tried to homogenize all regions in Spain, and tried to abolish the fueros of the Basque provinces and Navarre. The constitution of 1837, for example, established that the same codes should govern the entire kingdom, and a single fuero should apply to all Spaniards. Nonetheless, only two years after, by the end of the First Carlist War, the law of 25 October 1839, again recognized the validity of their fueros, even though the government retained the right to modify them if necessary in the nation's interest. So, the law of 16 August 1841 known as Ley Paccionada (negotiated law) introduced changes and suppressed some of the provisions of Navarrese fueros and established the convenio económico (economic covenant) as the system of fiscal autonomy. In the case of the Basque provinces, at the first stance the Royal Decree of 29 October 1841 greatly reduced the scope of the fueros in the three provinces, eliminating the judicial autonomy of the territories and substituted the Deputations and General Juntas with Provincial Deputations, which were the institutions of government common to all provinces of Spain. Finally, the law of 21 July 1876, during the time known in Spanish history as the Restoration, abolished the fueros of the Basque provinces while, paradoxically, keeping the fiscal autonomy of the territories in the form of a concierto económico, \\"economic treaty\\". This system was abolished in Gipuzkoa and Biscay during the Spanish Civil War, through the decree-law of 23 July 1937, as a \\"punishment\\" for taking up arms against the National Movement, the insurrection that led to the dictatorial regime of Francisco Franco. At the end of Franco's regime, new laws derogated that decree-law. During Spanish transition to democracy, the recognition of these fueros was one of the hardest to reach a consensus on, and incited many heated debates, but in the end the Constituent Assembly opted to recognize them within the framework of the constitution and the Statutes of Autonomy — the basic organic laws of the autonomous communities that were to be created — and therefore they were to be \\"updated\\" or \\"modernized\\". ==Fiscal autonomy in the communities of chartered regime== The provinces of Álava, Gipuzkoa and Biscay, in exercise of the right to self-government of all \\"nationalities and regions\\" granted in the constitution, joined to form the autonomous community of the Basque Country, and recognized itself as one of the \\"nationalities of Spain\\". These three territories had historically been known as the \\"Basque provinces\\" (). The Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, establishes that the community could incorporate Navarre, if its population so desired. The Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country, in exercising the right recognized in the First Additional Disposition, created its own autonomous treasury and established its fiscal autonomy. In practice, what this means, is that the historical territories of the Basque Country have the faculty to maintain, establish and regulate their tax systems, including the ability to collect, manage and inspect all State taxes — that is all the taxes established by the central government — with the exception of import duties and the value added tax. The autonomous community then transfers to the central government a specific amount of money, for the management of those competences that the community did not assume, but that are within the central government's scope of action. This amount is known as cupo, \\"quota\\", or aportación, \\"contribution\\", and the treaty whereby this system is recognized is known as concierto, \\"treaty\\", or convenio, \\"pact\\". Navarre, on the other hand, chose not to form part of the autonomous community of the Basque Country and, unlike the other communities, it acceded to self-government by taking as a starting point the recognition of their fueros, based on the Ley Paccionada, \\"Negotiated Law\\", of 1841, which had been declared valid. In lieu of a Statute of Autonomy per se, the Parliament of Navarre passed a Law of Reintegration and Improvement of Navarre's Chartered Regime, even if in practice this Law is recognized as the equivalent of a Statute of Autonomy. This Law for Navarre also created its own treasury and established its fiscal autonomy, and, as in the case of the Basque Country, Navarre collects all taxes and then sends a \\"quota\\" or \\"contribution\\" to the central government. The main difference between the Basque Country and Navarre, is that in the Basque Country it is the historical territories (Araba, Gipuzkoa and Biscay) that have their own \\"chartered\\" system, and as such they are recognized as \\"chartered deputations\\" (, ) which then jointly conform the autonomous community of the Basque Country, whereas Navarre, being a province and an autonomous community in itself, is recognized as a \\"chartered community\\" (, ) as opposed to an \\"autonomous community\\". ==Chartered communities within the State of Autonomies== The territorial administration in Spain in which 17 autonomous communities were created is known as the \\"State of the Autonomies\\". The 15 communities which are not part of the chartered regime belong to what is known as a \\"common regime\\", in which the central government is in charge of collecting taxes from all communities and then redistributing them for purposes of a so-called \\"fiscal-equalization\\". In practice, richer common- regime communities become net contributors, while poorer communities are net recipients of redistributed money from the central government. Since the two chartered communities collect all taxes themselves and only send a quota for those competences that still belong to the central government, they do not receive anything back. In Catalonia, one of the largest net contributors to the \\"common-regime\\" system, nationalist parties feel that the system is unbalanced, and have voiced its concerned that their \\"net contribution\\" is disproportionally larger when compared to what occurs in redistribution or contribution systems in other countries in Europe (only the Community of Madrid is a larger net contributor to the system, with almost twice the contribution deficit of Catalonia). Though not part of the common-regime system, for comparative purposes, when taking into account the \\"quota\\" transferred to the central government, the Basque Country and Navarre would be among the smallest contributors, despite being the among the richest communities in income per capita. Catalan nationalist politicians have demanded either a change in the \\"common-regime\\" system or full fiscal autonomy for Catalonia like that enjoyed by the communities of chartered regime. This demand is largely supported by the Catalan population. ==See also== * Nueva Planta decrees, which abolished the fueros of the territories of the Crown of Aragon ==References== Category:Politics of Spain ","title":"Communities of chartered regime"},{"id":"35293771","text":"Dorothy Elizabeth Montgomery [״Monty״] (February 6, 1924 – September 17, 2009) was a utility infielder who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.

She graduated from Red Bank High School in 1943 and received her bachelor of science degree from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 1947. ==Baseball career== In her college years, Montgomery worked at Peerless Woolen Mills and played for its semi- professional softball team, the Wollenettes. After being spotted by a talent scout while playing for the team, she received an invitation to try out for the league in the 1945 spring training. She practiced with the Racine Belles, but they cut her before the regular season began. They sent me back home because I was a little ′green′, she explained in an interview.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League Montgomery tried again in 1946 and was assigned to the Muskegon Lassies. She played at infield positions during the season, collecting a .208 batting average in 26 games. In 1947 she left college early to attend the first AAGPBL spring training outside the United States, which was held in 1947 in Cuba at the Gran Stadium de La Habana. She was allocated to the Grand Rapids Chicks, but when the league returned to the United States she was cut. I didn't have my heart in playing ball, she admitted a long time after that. ==Work after baseball== After hanging up her cleats, Montgomery finished her studies and became a registered cytologist for 28 years. She taught some before going to work at hospitals, teaching at Tennessee Vocational School and Laveran High School. She also was employed with Railway Express Agency, Erlanger Hospital and Combustion Engineering as a nurse. She could not return to playing softball for five years after her AAGPBL days, then she played until she was 68 years old. Montgomery set up a pap smear laboratory at the Welborn Clinic in Evansville, Indiana before retiring in 1992. She then moved to her parents' home at Chattanooga, Tennessee and enjoyed bowling and motorcycles. In addition, she was a member of the Women’s Softball Hall of Fame and attended AAGPBL Players Association reunions. The association was largely responsible for the opening of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. ==Death== Dorothy Montgomery died in Chattanooga, Tennessee at the age of 85, after a short illness.

She was named after the Norwegian island of Vigra. ==History== Wartime service The Vigra was originally built as a SC-497 class submarine chaser for the United States Navy. She was laid down on 23 May 1942 by Harris and Parsons Inc. of East Greenwich, RI and launched on 26 September 1942. She was commissioned into the US Navy as USS SC-1061 on 5 January 1943. In August 1943 US Admiral Harold R. Stark, commander of US Naval Forces Europe, ordered SC-1061 and two other SC-class subchasers - SC-683 and SC-718 - to be transferred to Britain. Stationed in Miami at the time, the three subchasers received top secret orders to report to Brooklyn Navy Yard where they were to await further orders. When they arrived at the Naval Yard, the vessels' commanders were ordered to warn their crews to observe strict silence about their movements and were told that the three ships had been picked for a \\"special purpose\\". The three subchasers were hoisted aboard three Liberty Ships and secured as deck cargo and preparations made to transport them and their crews to an undisclosed location. It was only when the ships were under way that the crews were told that they were bound for Belfast. The ships arrived in Belfast in early October 1943, where the three subchasers were lifted back into the water, and on 14 October the three ships sailed up the Firth of Clyde to the US Naval base known as Rosneath naval base, where a group of exiled Norwegian sailors of the Shetland Bus organisation were awaiting the vessels' arrival. It was not until the three ships moored that their US crews finally learned that the purpose of their journey was to train the Norwegians in the operation of the subchasers' equipment, and that upon completion of the training they were to hand their ships over to Norwegian command. The training lasted just a week, then the transfer of command was completed. After assuming command at Rosneath, the Norwegian crews sailed their new vessels first to Derry, and then to Scalloway in Shetland, where they completed their fitting-out. The subchasers' depth charge racks, Mousetrap anti-submarine rocket launchers, and K-gun depth charge projectors were removed, and an additional set of davits were installed so that each ship could carry two boats, whose motors were equipped with specially muffled exhausts for ultra-quiet running. They also removed one of the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon from amidships and installed a 2-pounder gun aft and two cal .50 machine guns on the flying bridge. The ships were christened Hitra (SC-718), Hessa (SC-683), and Vigra (SC-1061). The Vigra and her sister vessels superseded the famous fleet of civilian fishing boats that had formerly run naval operations between Shetland and Norway. During the final two years of World War II the three ships performed a total of 114 missions to occupied Norway, and apart from one incident when a Canadian aircraft fired on Hessa, the voyages were uneventful and there were no casualties. Late in the war an observer from Admiral Stark's office wrote: Postwar After the war the Vigra performed coast guard duties until 1953. All three submarine chasers were mothballed at Marvika and formally decommissioned in 1959.The Vigra was first sold to Sea Scouts for 1 NOK and finally sank near Malmö where she was used as a sand barge.http://www.scandion.no/hordaland/lindas/kjentfolk/eidsheim.html The name HNoMS Vigra is today held by a smaller patrol vessel used by the Norwegian Naval Academy for Officer cadet training (P359) ==NotesReferences== * * Category:World War II patrol vessels of Norway Category:1942 ships Category:Ships transferred from the United States Navy to the Royal Norwegian Navy Category:Ships built in Rhode Island SC-1061 Category:SC-497-class submarine chasers of the Royal Norwegian Navy ","title":"HNoMS Vigra"},{"id":"35293807","text":"Willie Williams (April 14, 1951 - June 8, 2019) was an American karateka and mixed martial artist. == Career == In 1975, Willie Williams participated in Mas Oyama's 1st World Full-Contact Karate Open Championships tournament as part of the U.S. team coached by Tadashi Nakamura and Shigeru Oyama.

It was co-directed by Naoyoshi Shiotani and Katsuyuki Motohiro and written by Gen Urobuchi, with character designs by Akira Amano and featuring music by Yugo Kanno. The series aired on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block between October 2012 and March 2013. A second season aired between October and December 2014, with a feature film titled, Psycho-Pass: The Movie released in January 2015. In 2019, Psycho-Pass: Sinners of the System premiered the first of its three independent films, spanning release dates between January and March. All of the stories take place in an authoritarian future dystopia where omnipresent public sensors continuously scan the mental states of every passing citizen. A third season aired between October and December 2019, with a sequel film, Psycho-Pass 3: First Inspector, released in March 2020. Psycho- Pass originated from Production I.G.'s interest in making a successor to Mamoru Oshii's achievements. The series was inspired by several live-action films. Chief director Katsuyuki Motohiro aimed to explore psychological themes in society's youth using dystopian storylines. Multiple books and movies influenced Psycho-Pass with the most notable being the 1982 American science fiction film Blade Runner. The series was licensed by Funimation in North America. Two manga adaptations have been serialized in Shueisha's Jump Square magazine. Several novels, including an adaptation and prequels to the original story, have been published. An episodic video game adaptation called Chimi Chara Psycho-Pass was developed by Nitroplus staffers in collaboration with Production I.G. New novels and another manga were serialized in 2014. A prequel manga centered around Kogami's past has been written. The first season of the anime garnered critical acclaim in both Japan and the west with critics praising the characters' roles and interactions set within the dystopian environment. The animation has also been praised despite issues in latter episodes which required fixing in the DVD volumes of the series. On the other hand, the second series, Psycho-Pass 2, received mixed critical response stemming from its heavy use of gore as well as the characterization of the new villain. ==Plot== Setting Psycho-Pass is set in a futuristic Japan where the , a powerful bio-mechanical computer network in which it uses the minds of Criminally Asymptomatic brains to endlessly measures the biometrics of Japanese citizens' brains and mentalities using a \\"cymatic scan.\\" The resulting assessment is called a , which includes a numeric index, revealing the citizen's criminality potential, and a color-coded Hue, alerting law enforcement to other data, as well as the improvement (clearing) or decline (clouding) of said Psycho-Pass. When a targeted individual's Crime Coefficient index exceeds the accepted threshold (100), they are pursued, apprehended, and either arrested or decomposed by the field officers of the Crime Investigation Department of the Ministry of Welfare's Public Safety Bureau. Elite officers known as Inspectors research and evaluate crime scenes, including all personnel involved, with the assistance of Enforcers. Enforcers are latent criminals charged with protecting the Inspectors, adding their expertise and carrying out Inspectors' instructions. Both are equipped with personally activated, hand-held weapons called \\"Dominators\\" whose integrated scanners provide the target's immediate Psycho-pass. The gun-like weapon can only fire when approved by the Sibyl System and triggered by its owner. Inspectors and Enforcers work as a team, though Inspectors have jurisdiction to fire their Dominators on the Enforcers should they pose a danger to the public or the Inspectors themselves. Story Psycho-Pass is seen through the eyes of Akane Tsunemori, a rookie Inspector within Unit One (aka Division One) of the Ministry of Welfare Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department. Shinya Kogami is an Enforcer under her watch during her first mission. When she judges him a threat to an apprehended criminal's life, she uses her Dominator to prevent him from decomposing the criminal. Initially ashamed of her action, Kogami thanks her for preventing what could be perceived as murder, an opinion which influences Tsunemori to stay on the force. The unit uncovers the crimes of Shogo Makishima, a prolific criminal mastermind. Makishima is – a person persistently assessed by the Sibyl System as having a low crime coefficient despite all actions and attitudes, thus protecting him from Dominator harm. Tsunemori is accompanied by veteran Inspector Nobuchika Ginoza, a strict man who looks down on Enforcers; Tomomi Masaoka, a middle- aged Enforcer who used to be a detective; Shusei Kagari, a carefree young man who was marked as a latent criminal in childhood; and Yayoi Kunizuka, a former musician turned into a latent criminal stemming from a relationship with a terrorist. The unit starts hunting Makishima, but it is Kogami who is most invested, having lost a friend at the hands of the villain. Meanwhile, Makishima is invited by Joshu Kasei, the android form of Sibyl, to join their ranks. He refuses and flees. Realizing this, Kogami leaves Unit One to find and kill him. The Sibyl System orders Tsunemori to capture Makishima and execute Kogami, but she agrees only on the condition that they withdraw the execution order for Kogami. Unit One now searches for both men. Upon finding him, Makishima nearly kills Ginoza, but Masaoka sacrifices his life to save him and despite Tsunemori's efforts, Kogami kills Makishima then escapes from PSB confinement, whereabouts unknown. In Psycho-Pass 2, Tsunemori leads a restored Unit One that includes rookie inspector Mika Shimotsuki; Ginoza, who has been demoted to Enforcer; Kunizuka and two new Enforcers named Sakuya Togane and Sho Hinakawa. The team faces a new threat in the form of Kirito Kamui, another criminal mastermind who is invisble to the sibil system. like Makishima, intends to bring down the Sibyl System but, unlike Makishima, wants to do so by exploiting its flaws instead of wreaking havoc, and making it judge its self as a collective concussioness. Due to having parts from different people he is skilled in avoiding all forms of detection as the sibyil system is unable to recognize him. Also his skill in making medication he's capable of helping his supporters keep their Crime Coefficients low, few believe that he actually exists. Now at the end of this season lead inspector of unit one Akane Tsunemori leads Kirito Kamui to the core of the sybil system. Now in the end Sybil decides to recognize Kirito Kamui (鹿矛囲 桐斗) a collective mind of seven people. Tsunemori resists in Psycho-Pass: The Movie where she searches for Kogami, now a freedom fighter in another country. The fate of Kogami among other characters is explored in the Sinners of the System film. In Psycho-Pass 3 Tsunemori and her team help the people of Shambala Float uncover government corruption with the unlikely assistance of Kogami, whom Tsunemori locates while he is a member of a guerilla group he believes is working to bring freedom to the people of that country. The mission results in the disbandment of Unit One and Kogami's disappearance, yet again. An unrevealed situation leads to Tsunemori's arrest for putting the public in danger. The unfolding story and the truth Tsunemori seeks involves two new Inspectors: Arata Shindo and Kei Mikhail Ignatov. Their first case with the Public Safety Bureau involves investigating the crash landing of a passenger drone airplane that results in the death of a passenger and the discovery of a large group of immigrants. During the investigation and those that follow, Shindo and Ignatov uncover evidence of a conspiracy headed by a shadowy organization called Bifrost that uses the mechanism of a tournament game called Roundrobin in order to manipulate societal events. As evidence and knowledge about Bifrost increases, the focus of the story narrows until Shindo and Ignatov find themselves at odds with one another. This leads to a choice by Ignatov that is further explored in the 2020 sequel film Psycho-Pass 3: First Inspector. ==Production== Director Naoyoshi Shiotani. The series was directed by Naoyoshi Shiotani, written by Gen Urobuchi and features character designs by Reborn! manga artist Akira Amano. It stars Tomokazu Seki as Shinya Kogami, Kana Hanazawa as Akane Tsunemori, and Takahiro Sakurai as Shogo Makishima. Psycho-Pass originated from Production I.G.'s interest in making a successor to Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell and Patlabor, hiring Katsuyuki Motohirowho became the series' chief directorand veteran I.G. animator Naoyoshi Shiotani to supervise direction. Motohiro wanted to return to making anime after a long hiatus but he needed a charismatic script writer. Motohiro and his staff were surprised with Gen Urobuchi's contribution to the highly acclaimed anime series, Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Motohiro was fascinated by Madoka Magica and he had read other works by Urobuchi, which persuaded him to talk to Urobuchi. In early 2011, Motohiro proposed to Urobuchi that the pair should work together. Early in the making of the series, Motohiro told Naoyoshi Shiotani not to make anything that could not be adapted into a live- action film. Before work on Psycho-Pass started, Shiotani was busy working on the film, Blood-C: The Last Dark. As soon as his work with the film ended, Shiotani focused on the series' quality. After episode 16, which proved to be the most challenging and popular of the series, the team found themselves \\"out of stamina.\\" The next two episodes were made by an outside team, which is reflected in several problems with the animation. In response to this, the producer of the episode said that while he expected problems, he worked to make it the best he could. Shiotani also apologized for the episode's quality. The original team continued working from episode 19 on until the finale, deciding to remake episodes 17 and 18 for their retail release. Ubukata was the main writer in both the second and third series of Psycho-Pass The anime series was first announced in late March 2012 by Fuji TV at its Noitamina press conference. In March 2013, Shiotani stated there could be a second season if the show received enough support. Once development of the second season started, Shiotani said the new episodes were more difficult to make than those in the first season. He said, \\"it's more about the show's inflexibility\\" because the staff have to maintain consistency. For the second season Tow Ubukata replaced Urobuchi as the main writer. Ubukata mentions he was given the idea of expanding the setting in the form of a sequel. As a result of being given the scenario of the TV series and the film, Ubukata had to write the characters' personalities. Although the timeframe for the production was short, he had enough time to hold discussions with the first series' staff. Shiotani aided the team for the final episode which satisfied Ubukata. Much attention was given to developing Tsunemori as a lead character since Kogami was no longer present. Additionally, the new character who works as an Inspector, Mika Shimotsuki, was given the traits of the newcomer similar to Tsunemori, but different in a way Shiotani could not explain during development as a result of the series still premiering. During the final episodes of the first series, Shiotani conceived the idea of a Psycho-Pass film. Urobuchi and Motohiro said the film would have to contain a scenario independent of Japan's Sibyl System society. Shiotani wanted to create the film in collaboration with the staff who had worked on the first season and with character designer Naoyuki Onda and art director Shuichi Kusamori, who also worked on the series. Urobuchi believed the ideal sequel would be a film rather than a television series but wanted to stay true to the roots of the original series. The film's setting was intended to show how a future dystopia would occur outside of Japan and without the Sibyl System. To make the story more realistic, Shiotani decided to have the foreigners speak English, in contrast with other films in which they typically speak Japanese. Both lead actors, Tomokazu Seki (Kogami) and Kana Hanazawa (Akane), were surprised at this proposal because they had multiple English lines. Shiotani wished to explore what happens when a confined society expands into other countries, bringing chaos rather than peace, which would make the audience further question this ideal. Shiotani chose Southeast Asia, thinking a country working hard to further its development would be fitting for the story. The films Sinners of the System were first announced in Japan by Fuji TV in March 2018. Shiotani returned as the films' director. Novelist Ryō Yoshigami wrote the first film's script while the second one was written by Makoto Fukami. In regards to the first film, Shiotani picked Nobuchika Ginoza and Mika Shimotsuki as the main characters due to their similarities to the protagonists from the first television series, Kogami and Tsunemori, respectively. Nevertheless, he noted that this duo possessed a different dynamic due to Ginoza having undergone a notable character arc across the previous projects mainly due to his relationship with Masaoka and Kogami. Voice actress Ayane Sakura believed Shimotsuki was now more fitting for the role of a heroine thanks to her experience in the second television series where she was the youngest main character. Once the first movie premiered, Shiotani commented the trilogy would \\"broaden your perspective [the audience's]. They're those kinds of movies\\". For the 2019 anime series, Shiotani entrusted the writer Ubukata, Fukami and Yoshigami with handling a new cast. Fukami and Yoshikami wrote the script while Ubukata was in charge of the composition. Fukami was surprised with the ongoing dynamic between Shiotani and Ubukata as, despite the new story and character additions not included in the original series composition, the series still felt like Psycho-Pass. He clarified that every episode of the new series handle a different theme based on Ubukata's writing, and the writers found writing the second half of the series challenging. In creating the new leads, Arata Shindo and Kei Mihail Ignatov were handled as \\"two good buddies\\" while showcasing striking differences between them. Ubukata then conceived the idea of \\"psychology vs. combat\\" making Shindo a trained mentalist while Ignatov is former military with martial arts skills. Special attention was given to Shindo's characterization as he could come across as an unlikable character based on how he leads conversations but was still caring. Ubukata wanted the two main characters to be written solely by Fukami. Design When hearing the comments from Atsuko Ishizuka, director of The Pet Girl of Sakurasou, about the way the characters were first designed, Shiotani realized it was the opposite for his team, who had to create the setting first, then the characters because they \\"are almost being played by the world.\\" As a result, the characters were designed by manga artist Akira Amano to balance the dark atmosphere by having them \\"palatable and very relatable.\\" The staff avoided using bright colors that would stand out. Akane Tsunemori was created as the most relatable character, who would question the setting from the audience's point of view and as the heroine who would come between the main character, Shinya Kogami, and his main rival, and enemy, Shogo Makishima. Akane's progression from an innocent newcomer to a mature and haunted person was one of the staff's main objectives. Motohiro allowed his team to use very graphic elements, even though they could reduce female viewership. He acknowledged that the series may be too violent for a younger demographic and said that he would not want his son to watch it because of its psychological brutality. He added that the team did not want to make a violent series but an \\"artistic series that just happened to have some violence included in it\\". About the amount of violence, Shiotani told Urobuchi, \\"just let us deal with it.\\" Some of these violent scenes occur off-camera but whenever a protagonist was involved, the moment was developed to be memorable. The team twice had to remake scenes because the television station complained that they went \\"overboard.\\" Motohiro wanted the series to counter concurrent anime trends. The use of moe (slang) was banned at staff meetings because they appreciated dramas like Mobile Suit Gundam and Patlabor that focused on conflicts between male characters. As the series was \\"anti-moe,\\" the team decided to avoid having Tsunemori remove her clothes and instead had Kogami do it. Nevertheless, the show attracted a female viewership because the conflict between the male characters appeared to attract the shonen ai genre fans. Although Shiotani also wanted the series to avoid romance between male characters, he believed the fight scenes between male characters unintentionally attracted female fans. The staff decided to focus on friendships rather than romantic relationships. Influences The series was inspired by several Western films, most notably L.A. Confidential. Director Naoyoshi Shiotani cited several other influences, including Minority Report, Gattaca, Brazil and Blade Runner; the latter of which he compared very closely to Psycho-Pass. Before the making of the series, Urobuchi insisted on using a Philip K. Dick-inspired, dystopian narrative. The psychological themes were based on the time Shiotani watched Lupin III during his childhood because he thought about adding \\"today's youth trauma\\" to the series. The rivalry between the main characters was based on the several dramas the staff liked. Other voice actors have been credited in the making of the series because of the ways they added traits to the characters. Since the third series was handled by new writers (Fukami and Yoshigami), the new members used ideas from their superiors when writing the script such as Ubukata's novels Mardock Scramble and Spiegel. Music The staff had problems composing an opening theme for the series until someone provided some music by Ling Tosite Sigure, who was engaged to compose the opening theme. Egoist, who composed the ending theme, had debuted on Noitamina with Guilty Crown. Shiotani said they asked Egoist to record three versions of the ending theme so they could alternate them to match the episode's ending. Across the series, time limits resulted in the ending songs being removed or replaced with instrumental versions to avoid cutting scenes from the episode. When there were concerns from the producers of the songs, Tomohiro and Shiotani discussed this with them. Following the first series, Yugo Kanno made remixes of the original background themes as the staff found them enjoyable and might come across as appealing in the process. Two Psycho-Pass CDs were included in the second and fifth Japanese home media release of the series. The Psycho Pass original soundtrack was released by Sony Music Entertainment on May 29, 2013. It features fifty-five tracks composed by Kanno. The second original soundtrack was released on March 18, 2015. A two-volume drama CD called based on the prequel novel was released between September 25 and November 27, 2013. ==Themes== As some critics have noted, Psycho-Pass explores societal and psychological themes, such as the price of living without stress or fear of crime. Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. This raises the question of whether it is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. An example of this occurs in the first episode when a woman is kidnapped and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's rules, the police can decompose her, but Tsunemori delays action, choosing to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. This challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime correlates with actually committing a crime. According to Anime News Network, \\"We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal\\". Psycho- Pass further questions the notion of overriding the individual's needs in favor of general social value by asking the audience to consider if it is morally and socially acceptable to kill individuals who may potentially commit crimes so long as we accept that the harm caused to society outweighs the harm caused to an individual who is falsely charged. In other words, the Sibyl System operates on the principles of opportunity cost and acceptable risk. Relying on the Sibyl System paradoxically creates a society which fears no crime as a whole, but individuals who personally fear the consequences of the Sibyl System's verdicts. Urobuchi himself has said that one of the series' central thematic ideas is \\"fear.\\" Shogo Makishima's actions stem from feeling out of place because the Sibyl System cannot accept him as he is, labeling him a deviant within the structure of society itself. Emotional repression is another theme explored in Psycho-Pass. The identification of latent criminals is partially based on the emotions judged by society to be negative, such as sadness or anger, being scanned by the Sibyl System. Kotaku states, \\"because of these scans, Psycho-Pass shows an interesting future where 'mental beauty' is as sought after as physical beauty. It is also a future where the police's job is little more than to watch the latent criminals they control—because if they did any real detective work, they might start to think like the criminals they are trying to catch and thus become latent criminals themselves.\\" Many of the main characters feel nostalgia throughout the series. The many references to older literature, philosophy, music and theater create a \\"nostalgic world building for a time before psycho-passes\\". ==Media== Anime The anime series produced by Production I.G. was broadcast in Japan on Fuji TV's Noitamina programming block between October 12, 2012 and March 22, 2013. Toho started releasing the series on DVD and Blu-ray formats on December 21, 2012. The eighth and final volume was released on July 26, 2013.

The player controls Kogami and Tsunemori while an original character named Tadashi Kamino will mentor the player. ==Reception and legacy== Fuji TV producer Akitoshi Mori said Psycho-Pass was the first work under his control. Early screenings of the series at the Noitamina Shop & Café attracted few viewers, which bothered Mori. However, as the series continued, the quantity of viewers increased. By the final episode, over 1,000 people had queued to watch the finale even though the venue could only accommodate seventy people. This made Mori happy because he realized fans were following and supporting the show; but he wanted to see a bigger audience at future screenings. DVDs and Blu-ray discs of the series achieved good sales. In April 2014, the series was nominated for the Seiun Award. In the Newtype anime awards from 2013, it was voted as fourth best title of the year. Episode 11 of the series was awarded \\"Best Episode\\" in the Noitamina 10th anniversary fan vote. Shinya Kogami, Akane Tsunemori and Shogo Makishima also appeared in such polls as winners of their own categories. Anime News Network listed it as the fifth most accessible anime series for people who have not watched Japanese animation. Psycho-Pass was voted as the 19th best anime in a 2017 NHK online poll of \\"Best Anime 100\\". Crunchyroll included the series among the \\"Top 100 anime of the decade\\" list, with writer Kyle Cardine stating that the series \\"has had a lasting effect as a gripping dystopian sci-fi cop drama among the Urobuchi repertoire.\\" Cold Cobra of Anime UK News picked the series for his list of \\"best anime of 2010s\\" and hailed Psycho-Pass as a \\"sci-fi masterpiece.\\" IGN also listed Psycho-Pass among the best anime of the decade, and wrote that the series is \\"a psychological thriller with multiple layers of mystery\\" that \\"kept us on our toes through the entirety of the first season.\\" In 2020, Anime News Network listed Psycho-Pass as the fourth best Gen Urobuchi anime. Kotaku Australia included the series among \\"8 Great Anime Series For People Who Don't Like Anime\\" list. The first season has garnered critical acclaim. The Daily Star regarded it as one of the most iconic thriller anime due to the handling of society and the two lead characters. Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network praised the show for its \\"high level of interest\\" in depicting its dystopian world. However, she said that its violent scenes were so gruesome they might scare viewers. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis called it a \\"compelling cyberpunk mystery\\", praising the society depicted and the series of murders orchestrated by Shogo Makishima. However, he criticized the use of advanced technology and compared it with other science fiction films despite saying that it handled the themes better whereas Makishima's immunity to it was left unexplained. DVD Talk gave high praise to Makishima because of his achievements across the story and his personality. Certain episodes have been referred to as \\"filler\\" because they are used as a build-up to the climactic ones. Bamboo Dong of Anime News Network gave high praise stating that from episode 12, the series was \\"a real blast to watch\\" and that she was glad with the development of the protagonist, Akane Tsunemori. However, she severely criticized the plot twist regarding the Sybil System's true identity calling it \\"one of the stupidest revelations in the history of anime\\". Thomas Zoth from The Fandom Post praised the show's focus on the relationships between the protagonists and the development from these. Tsunemori's growth across the series earned major praise by multiple reviewers. Zoth enjoyed the series' climactic action scenes between Kogami and Makishima, and the scenes portraying the status quo. He said the sixteenth episode is \\"Urobuchi's masterpiece.\\" Silverman commented on the parallelism between Tsunemori's and Kogami's development, which resulted in an ambiguous ending that should be decided by the viewers. The supporting cast received similar praise by DVD Talk but the reviewer said some were underwhelming and Karanomori is the least-explored character. During the streaming of the series, Silverman criticized the animation because of the low lighting levels that might make it hard to understand. Hiroko Yamamura from Japanator noted the series' high budget and praised the animation style and the focus on details and technology. She was attracted by its premise and expected the quality to remain consistent across the entire series. Similarly, Jacob Hope Chapman from ANN praised the animation for its high quality. Episode 18, which is known for its flawed animation, was improved for the home media release of the series. Feedback to Psycho-Pass 2 has ranged from mixed to negative. Dan Rhodes from UK Anime Network noted that Psycho-Pass 2, while entertaining, lacked the twists of the first season and appeal of Gen Urobuchi's writing. Richard Eisenbeis from Kotaku praised the origins of the Sybil System which was unexplained in the first season. While also praising the differences between Tsunemori and the new Inspector, Mika Shimotsuki, Eisenbeis criticized the new antagonist and how much gorier the series was in contrast to the first one. Nick Creamer from Anime News Network panned the series, giving it an overall \\"F\\" as he felt the new writer, Tow Ubukata, did not make the anime appealing despite his previous enjoyable works. He went on to say \\"overall, Psycho-Pass 2 stands as one of the most disappointing works I've ever watched to completion,\\" citing it a failure as both a sequel and an independent series. Psycho-Pass 3 has received better treatment than its immediate predecessor with kudos given for the new characters and a script that tackled such modern day topics as immigration, corporate financial mismanagement and genetic manipulation. ==See also== *Anatta *Reductionism *Holism *Holon *Fallacy of composition ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * * * Category:2012 anime television series Category:2012 manga Category:2013 Japanese novels Category:2013 Japanese television series endings Category:2014 anime television series Category:2014 manga Category:Amputees in fiction Category:Animated television series about robots Category:Anime with original screenplays Category:Bioterrorism in fiction Category:Censored television series Category:Comics set in the 22nd century Category:Crime in anime and manga Category:Cyberpunk anime and manga Category:Dark Horse Comics titles Category:Dystopian anime and manga Category:Funimation Category:Government in fiction Category:IG Port franchises Category:LGBT in anime and manga Category:Light novels Category:Mag Garden manga Category:Mass surveillance in fiction Category:Medicine and health in fiction Category:Mental illness in fiction Category:Mystery anime and manga Category:Nitroplus Category:NoitaminA Category:Philosophy television series Category:Post-traumatic stress disorder in fiction Category:Production I.G Category:Propaganda in fiction Category:Psychological thriller anime and manga Category:Revenge in anime and manga Category:Science fiction anime and manga Category:Shueisha manga Category:Shōnen manga Category:Tatsunoko Production Category:Television censorship in China Category:Television series set in the 22nd century Category:Television shows set in Japan Category:Terrorism in television Category:Works banned in China Category:Works set in the 2100s ","title":"Psycho-Pass"},{"id":"35293843","text":"Jen Dziura is a New York-based writer, educational humorist, and educator. == Early life == Jen Dziura was born and raised in Virginia Beach.

She was named after the Norwegian island of Hessa. ==History== Wartime service The Hessa was originally built as a SC-497 class submarine chaser for the United States Navy. She was laid down on 9 April 1942 by the American Cruiser Co. of Trenton, MI and launched on 14 October 1942. She was commissioned into the US Navy as USS SC-683 on 30 November 1943. In August 1943 US Admiral Harold R. Stark, commander of US Naval Forces Europe, ordered SC-683 and two other SC-class subchasers - SC-1061 and SC-718 - to be transferred to Britain. Stationed in Miami at the time, the three subchasers received top secret orders to report to Brooklyn Navy Yard where they were to await further orders. When they arrived at the Naval Yard, the vessels' commanders were ordered to warn their crews to observe strict silence about their movements and were told that the three ships had been picked for a \\"special purpose\\". The three subchasers were hoisted aboard three Liberty Ships and secured as deck cargo and preparations made to transport them and their crews to an undisclosed location. It was only when the ships were under way that the crews were told that they were bound for Belfast. The ships arrived in Belfast in early October 1943, where the three subchasers were lifted back into the water, and on 14 October the three ships sailed up the Firth of Clyde to the US Naval base known as Rosneath naval base, where a group of exiled Norwegian sailors of the Shetland Bus organisation were awaiting the vessels' arrival. It was not until the three ships moored that their US crews finally learned that the purpose of their journey was to train the Norwegians in the operation of the subchasers' equipment, and that upon completion of the training they were to hand their ships over to Norwegian command. The training lasted just a week, then the transfer of command was completed. After assuming command at Rosneath, the Norwegian crews sailed their new vessels first to Derry, and then to Scalloway in Shetland, where they completed their fitting-out. The subchasers' depth charge racks, Mousetrap anti-submarine rocket launchers, and K-gun depth charge projectors were removed, and an additional set of davits were installed so that each ship could carry two boats, whose motors were equipped with specially muffled exhausts for ultra-quiet running. They also removed one of the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon from amidships and installed a 2-pounder gun aft and two cal .50 machine guns on the flying bridge. The ships were christened Hitra (SC-718), Hessa (SC-683), and Vigra (SC-1061). The Hessa and her sister vessels superseded the famous fleet of civilian fishing boats that had formerly run naval operations between Shetland and Norway. During the final two years of World War II the three ships performed a total of 114 missions to occupied Norway, and apart from one incident when a Canadian aircraft fired on Hessa, the voyages were uneventful and there were no casualties. Late in the war an observer from Admiral Stark's office wrote: Postwar After the war the Hessa performed coast guard duties until 1953. All three submarine chasers were mothballed at Marvika and formally decommissioned in 1959. The Hessa was first sold to Sea Scouts for 1 NOK and was lost on the coast of Bohuslenhttp://www.scandion.no/hordaland/lindas/kjentfolk/eidsheim.html .

It lived during the Toyonian stage (Upper Olenellus-zone), in what is today the South-Western United States. Eopeachella angustispina is the only known species in this genus (i.e. the genus is monotypic). == Etymology == Eopeachella is named for its early occurrence compared to and presumed closeness to Peachella. The species epithet angustispina refers to the slender genal spines compared to those in the species of Peachella. == Description == Only the cephalon of Eopeachella is known. It is a small sized biceratopsid trilobite, that exhibits the effaced cephalic features that are typical for that family. Eopeachella has short, stout genal spines, which are somewhat inflated at base and terminate in pointed tips and inflated lateral cephalic borders. The cephalon is semi-circular in outline with short, strongly inflated rounded spines. The central area of the cephalon (or glabella) is elongated, reaching the anterior border, and hourglass shaped. Its features are effaced, showing only shallow furrows.  Differences with some other Biceratopsinae  Some other Biceratopsinae share some of the most eye catching features of Eopeachella. These differ however in the following characteristics. Biceratops nevadensis, Emigrantia and Peachella all have more extremely effaced cephalic features. Biceratops lacks genal spines. In Emigrantia the genal spines are longer than the cephalon and attach halfway down its side (or lateral margin). Peachella has club-like genal spines. The genal spine bases and lateral cephalic border are also inflated in Paranephrolenellus inflatus, but this species differs from Eopeachella in having clearly visible glabellar furrows, and strongly divergent ocular lobes.  Relations with other biceratopsids  Eopeachella first occurs in the fossil record before both Peachella species, although it overlaps with P. iddingsi. The thick, tapered, genal spines and shallow but clear glabellar furrows of E. angustispina are intermediate between the Peachella species that have club-like strongly inflated genal spines and more radically effaced cephalic features and ancestral olenelloidea. == Distribution == Specimens of Eopeachella angustispina have been collected from the Delamar Mountains in Lincoln County, Nevada. == Habitat == E. angustispina was probably a marine bottom dweller, like all Olenellina. == Ecology == E. angustispina occurs together with Olenellus nevadensis, Peachella iddingsi and Bristolia sp.. == References == Category:Cambrian trilobites of North America Category:Fossil taxa described in 2009 Category:Redlichiida genera Category:Biceratopsidae ","title":"Eopeachella"},{"id":"35293944","text":"The 2012 Open Barletta Trofeo Dimiccoli & Boraccino was a professional tennis tournament played on clay courts.

It is found off the Atlantic coasts of South America. ==Description== When small, Lychnorhiza lucerna has a hemispherical bell, but this becomes flattened into a saucer shape as the jellyfish grows. Very large specimens have been known to reach in diameter and are dish-shaped. The upper surface is flexible and thin and is covered in low conical projections. Round the periphery are many small, triangular lappets. Hanging under the bell there are four pairs of oral tentacles, about two thirds as long as the diameter of the bell. The upper halves of these are somewhat flattened and the lower halves divide into three vanes which have multiple, inrolled edges. Among these are suctorial mouthlets leading to the interior of the bell and various thick dangling filaments. There is no central mouth. The stomach occupies most of the interior of the bell and there are a ring of small cream or white gonads round its edge. The colouration of this jellyfish varies, but in general, the bell is translucent and colourless or a pale shade of buff, sometimes with irregular streaks of light brown. The dangling lappets round the edge of the bell are darker brown and the lower parts of the oral tentacles may be brown as well, the upper parts being colourless.Lychnorhiza lucerna Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2012-04-01. ==Distribution== Lychnorhiza lucerna is found in tropical waters in the western Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from French Guyana to Buenos Aires Province in Argentina. It occurs in shallow coastal habitats and estuaries and is the most abundant jellyfish in its order (Rhizostomeae) in these waters. It often becomes stranded on beaches. ==Life history== Lychnorhiza lucerna has a complex life cycle with an alternation of sexual and asexual stages. An adult jellyfish is known as a medusa and is gonochoristic, which means that it is either male or female. The fertilized eggs hatch into planula larvae. These soon settle and undergo metamorphosis into sessile polyps, known as a scyphistomae, with four tentacles. These grow larger, and after a series of moults have twenty-two tentacles. They develop cysts from which new polyps known as ephyrae grow. These develop transverse constrictions and separate from the original polyp by strobilation. The scyphistomae can strobilate several times and in a study it was estimated that one founder polyp could produce up to sixty ephyrae in a period of four months. Ephyrae develop into juvenile medusae after a further fifteen days or so. ==Ecology== Lychnorhiza lucerna has associations with the parasitic flatworm Dibothriorhynchus dinoi, shrimps Periclimenes spp, the Atlantic bumper fish, Chloroscombrus chrysurus and the bluntnose jack, Hemicaranx amblyrhynchus. Young spider crabs, Libinia ferreirae and Libinia spinosa, use the inside of the bell as a nursery where they are safe from predation. ==References== Category:Rhizostomeae Category:Animals described in 1880 Category:Taxa named by Ernst Haeckel ","title":"Lychnorhiza lucerna"},{"id":"35294014","text":"Jornalista Benedito Pimentel–Ourinhos State Airport is the airport serving Ourinhos, Brazil. ==History== The airport is dedicated to general aviation. ==Airlines and destinations== No scheduled flights operate at this airport. ==Access== The airport is located from downtown Ourinhos. ==See also== *List of airports in Brazil ==References* * Category:Airports in São Paulo (state) ","title":"Ourinhos Airport"},{"id":"35294026","text":"Conrad I of Raabs (died 1143) was Burgrave of Nuremberg from to jointly with his older brother Gottfried II. After Gottfried II died, Conrad ruled alone until his own death. == Life == Conrad I was a member of the edelfrei von Raabs family. He was a son of Gottfried I of Gosham and a grandson of Ulrich of Gosham, the family's ancestor, who ruled an area northwest of Melk when the House of Babenberg ruled the Margraviate of Austria. The family takes its name from their ancestral castle in Raabs an der Thaya, which is now in Lower Austria. In 1105, Nuremberg Castle and the city became entangled in a dispute between Emperor Henry IV and his son Henry V. The city and castle were partially destroyed. In order to better protect the castle and city in the future, the emperor appointed Conrad I and his brother Gottfried II as Burgmann and made them responsible for the protection of the castle, making them burgraves. However, their official job title was Castellan; the title was first used by Gottfried III of Raabs. In the following years, Conrad I acted primarily to extend his territorial base to the west of Nuremberg. This brought him into conflict with the Bishopric of Bamberg; a document in Bamberg even calls him Conrad tyrannus. He appears to have lived in the area west of Nuremberg during this period, and occasionally called himself \\"Conrad of Riedfeld\\", after his castle near Neustadt an der Aisch. After his brother's death, Conrad became the sole lord of Nuremberg Castle. After his death, he was succeeded by his nephew, Gottfried II's son, Gottfried III. == References == * Sigmund Benker and Andraes Kraus (eds): Geschichte Frankens bis zum Ausgang des 18.

He is best known for \\"donating\\" large numbers of forged paintings and drawings to American art museums. ==Life and career== Mark Landis was born in Norfolk, Virginia. His grandfather, Arthur Landis, was a director at the now defunct Auburn Automobile company. His father, Arthur Landis Jr., a lieutenant (and later lieutenant commander) in the US Navy, married his mother, Jonita (1930–2010), in 1952. Landis was born three years later, and the family moved around because of his father's various postings. Following assignments in the Philippines and Hong Kong, Arthur Landis Jr. was posted to NATO in Europe, where the family lived in Cap Ferrat (France), London, Paris, and finally Brussels, where Landis began forging stamp cancellations for his friends.Wilkinson, Alec. \\"The Giveaway\\", The New Yorker, August 6, 2013. In 1968, the family returned to the United States, settling in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1971, Landis's father was diagnosed with cancer, from which he died the following year. At 17, Landis was deeply struck by the loss of his father and he was treated for 18 months in a Kansas hospital, where he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Landis attended art courses at the Art Institute of Chicago and then in San Francisco where, among other things, he worked on the maintenance of damaged paintings. He bought an art gallery, but it was not successful, and he lost money in a real-estate investment. In 1988, he decided to return to live with his mother and stepfather, James Brantley, in Laurel, Mississippi. Before Landis left, he wished to make a gesture that would please his mother and honor the memory of his father, so he donated a copy of a Maynard Dixon illustration he had created to a California museum as an original. This first successful attempt at art forgery convinced him to repeat the feat. For more than 20 years, Landis donated all kinds of faux pieces of art to institutions in the United States, including more than 50 museums. He generally chose smaller museums, which did not have the same means of detailed analysis as the larger ones. While not all institutions were duped, the whole process went largely unnoticed. Landis even donated up to six copies of the same work to different museums. During this period, Landis also produced original pieces; some have been sold through Narsad Artworks, which sells work by artists with mental illness. As of 2013, it was still possible to buy note cards bearing a work entitled Magnolias by Landis (which copies a work by Martin Johnson Heade without credit). Landis lived at more than 15 different addresses between 1985 and 2000. Patsy Hollister, Narsad co-founder, believes Landis probably is more bipolar than schizophrenic, with an ability to paint extremely fast. Says Landis, talking about icons: \\"I gave to hundreds of churches.\\" Landis is also said to have worked in animation and advertisement. Landis' success derives not so much from the perfection of his faux artworks (sometimes a basic test exposes the forgery) as from his ability to copy all kinds of styles, his choice to imitate lesser-known artists and his ability to play the role of an eccentric but sincere philanthropist. Moreover, museums tend not to authenticate gifts as carefully as works they buy. == Investigation == In 2007, Landis offered his copies of several works to the Oklahoma City Museum of Art, among them a watercolor by Louis Valtat, a harbor scene by Paul Signac, a self-portrait by Marie Laurencin, an oil painting by Stanislas Lépine, and a drawing by Daumier. The registrar, Matthew Leininger, investigated the pieces and discovered a very similar Signac had been offered to the SCAD Museum of Art. A press release had even noted the donation of the same Signac, Avery and Laurencin. It also provided Mark Landis's real name. Leininger investigated further, and discovered Landis had tricked more than 60 museums in 20 states, using a number of aliases including Stephen Gardiner, Father Arthur Scott (a Jesuit priest), Father James Brantley (his stepfather's name), Mark Lanois (one letter different from his own name), Martin Lynley, and John Grauman. Leininger warned other museums, providing available photos of Landis. At this stage, the investigation remained confidential. In September 2010, Landis went to the Paul and Lulu Hilliard University Art Museum in Lafayette, Louisiana, under the identity of Father Arthur Scott. He donated a painting by Charles Courtney Curran, citing the loss of his mother. The museum director, Mark A Tullos Jr., asked registrar Joyce Penn to check out the painting. When Penn examined it under ultraviolet light, the colors glowed suspiciously. In addition, a microscope observation showed a dot-matrix pattern, hinting that it was a photocopy of the original which had been projected on a board and then painted over. Penn dug deeper and linked up with Leininger's investigation. In November 2010, The Art Newspaper published a comprehensive article on the matter, inspiring other publishers such as the Financial Times to follow suit. Despite these exposés, Landis has continued his forgeries intermittently, with attempted gifts in November 2010 to the Ackland Art Museum (as Father Arthur Scott); in September 2012 to William Carey University (as Martin Lynley); and in October 2012 to several southern museums (as Lynley and as John Grauman). == Law infringement == It appears that in donating forgeries to art museums, Landis has not actually broken any laws, even though his activities were clearly deceptive. If he had sold the work to museums or taken a tax deduction on them, he might have fallen under federal art crime statutes. But the fact that he did not gain economically from his actions (apart from a few gifts from curators), and the fact that he addressed his donations to specialists who had the expertise to detect his forgeries but did not, protected him in the eyes of the law. No legal action has been opened against him to date (as of 2014). As one art crimes expert put it: \\"Basically, you have a guy going around the country on his own nickel giving free stuff to museums.\\" The damages of his 'gifts' is however estimated to be around 5 million dollars. == Exhibition == Both Tullos and Leininger wished to put an end to Landis's career as a forger, but could not. So Leininger and Aaron Cowan, director of the DAAP Galleries at the University of Cincinnati, set up an exhibition to address the general matter of art forgery, and specifically expose Landis's works. They collected some 60 pieces by Landis, who provided his \\"Jesuit priest\\" costume and some of his art books as well as attending the reception as guest of honor. Entitled \\"Faux Real\\", it took place in Spring 2012 at the Dorothy W. and C. Lawson Reed Jr. Gallery, University of Cincinnati.M. B.

The last native speaker is believed to have died in the first decade of the 2000s, at which time only 10 people were estimated to have Akuriyó as a second language. By 2012, only two semi-speakers remained. In December 2018, Sepi Akuriyó, one of the last surviving speakers of Akuriyó, went missing when a small plane carrying eight people disappeared during a flight over the Amazon rainforest. A search and rescue operation was called off after two weeks. ==Notes== Category:Indigenous peoples in Suriname Category:Indigenous peoples of the Guianas Category:Hunter-gatherers of South America Category:Ethnic groups in Suriname ","title":"Akurio people"},{"id":"35294198","text":"An old cafe house, Ruokala The experimental house by Alvar Aalto Muuratsalo is an island in lake Päijänne, Finland.

Born in the 1760s, Hollis entered the Navy in 1774 and served during the American Revolutionary War, seeing action at the Battle of Ushant and the French Revolutionary Wars in which he was badly wounded at the Glorious First of June. In 1801, as the captain of HMS Thames Hollis was heavily engaged at the Second Battle of Algeciras and in the Napoleonic Wars he served in a number of commissions and all major theatres. ==Life== Aiskew Paffard Hollis was born in approximately 1764 and joined the Royal Navy aged just ten in 1774 under the patronage of Captain Parry. Hollis served as a midshipman in the American War of Independence, first in the West Indies and later in the English Channel in a succession of frigates. By 1778 he was serving in HMS Valiant, which was engaged in the Battle of Ushant under Admiral Augustus Keppel.Royal Naval Biography, p. 115-122 He was promoted to lieutenant in 1781 and remained in the Navy following the end of the war, serving in a number of ships before, in 1793, joining HMS Queen at the request of Rear-Admiral Alan Gardner. In Queen, Hollis served in the Channel Fleet during the early years of the war and was badly wounded in the head by flying splinters at the Glorious First of June in 1794, during which Queen was heavily engaged. He also saw action the following year at the Battle of Groix.Annual Register, p. 249-250 In 1797, after a period of service in HMS Royal Sovereign and following promotion to commander in HMS Chichester, Hollis was sent to the Cape of Good Hope. There he was given command of guardship HMS Jupiter and tasked with putting down a mutiny at Robben Island by the crew of HMS Crescent. Hollis advanced on Crescent subdued the crew without conflict and towed the ship back to Cape Town, where the ringleaders of the mutiny were tried and convicted. As a reward, Hollis was given command of HMS Tremendous on the station and then the frigate HMS Vindictive, in which he escorted an East India Company convoy back to Britain. He was subsequently given command of HMS Thames in June 1801 and the following month participated in the Algeciras Campaign, firing on the French ship of the line Formidable during the Second Battle of Algeciras. He subsequently participated in a number of raids on the Spanish coastline before being sent back to Britain with his ship. Thames was decommissioned soon afterward and Hollis given command of HMS Mermaid, sailing to the West Indies in 1804, and was anchored at Havana when war broke out between Britain and Spain. To avoid his ship being seized, Hollis was forced to warp out of the harbour at night just before the Spanish attacked his ship. Mermaid was subsequently attached to the North American command, blockading French forces anchored in Chesapeake Bay until 1807, when the ship was sent back to Britain for urgent repairs. Hollis was transferred to HMS Standard and joined the Baltic Fleet, where he commanded the squadron that captured the Danish fortress at Anholt. He remained in the Baltic Sea until 1811, when he was transferred to HMS Achille in which he served with the Mediterranean Fleet, especially in the Adriatic Sea. He later served with the Channel Fleet and was on convoy duty off South America when the war ended. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars he took command of HMS Rivoli and then HMS Ramillies, serving as acting commander at Portsmouth for several long periods and in 1820 entertaining King George IV during a visit to the dockyard. He did not hold an active commission after 1820, but remained in service and rose to the rank of vice-admiral, retiring to his estate at Highfield, Southampton and dying there aged 80 in June 1844. ==NotesReferences== * Retrieved on 6 April 2012 * Category:1760s births Category:1844 deaths Category:Royal Navy admirals Category:Royal Navy personnel of the American Revolutionary War Category:Royal Navy personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:Royal Navy personnel of the Napoleonic Wars ","title":"Aiskew Hollis"},{"id":"35294264","text":"Libinia ferreirae is a species of tropical spider crab in the family Epialtidae. It is found on the seabed in shallow waters off the Atlantic coast of South America. ==Description== Like other spider crabs, Libinia ferreirae has a roughly circular spiny carapace that extends forwards into a rostrum between the two, stalked eyes. It has five pairs of walking limbs. ==Distribution== Libinia ferreirae is found off the Atlantic coast of South America in the intertidal zone and at depths down to about . The range extends from Venezuela and the Guianas, through parts of Brazil to Uruguay. ==Biology== The larvae of Libinia ferreirae are planktonic and have one prezoeal stage, two zoeal stages and one megalopa stage. The carapace of the zoea has one short rostral and one curved dorsal spine and some of the abdominal segments have spiny projections. The post-larval megalopa has a downturned rostrum, a carapace with various protuberances and four pairs of abdominal appendages. ==Ecology== Libinia ferreirae is often found in association with the jellyfish, Lychnorhiza lucerna. Juvenile crabs are found living within the bell, on the oral arms or clinging to the exterior, even on jellies that have been stranded on the shore. The crabs are mostly less than in diameter and probably colonized the jellyfish when they were larvae. The number of jellyfish acting as host is low but increases with the size of the jellyfish and the inhabited ones mostly house a single crab. The crab may be immune to or able to tolerate the jellyfish stings. It is thought that the crab benefits from using the jellyfish as a nursery because free-living, young crabs are eaten by predatory fish. Other benefits of this arrangement to the crab are a potential increase in food supply and transport to new locations. There do not seem to be any benefits to the jellyfish and the arrangement may be deleterious to it if the crab nibbles its interior tissues, as happens in some other crab/jellyfish relationships. At some stage the crab emerges from the bell and falls to the sea bed. Adult Libinia ferreirae often have faunal epibionts growing on their carapace. These include algae, polychaete worms, sea anemones, barnacles, bryozoans and hydroids. The most common species growing on the carapace was the sea anemone, Calliactis tricolor, which seems to be used by the crabs as camouflage. Bryozoans colonised the legs as well as the carapace. ==References== Category:Majoidea Category:Crustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Crustaceans described in 1871 ","title":"Libinia ferreirae"},{"id":"35294274","text":"Eastern Michigan University Historic District is an area of land on the very south end of the Eastern Michigan University campus. Eastern Michigan University is a comprehensive, co-educational public university located in Ypsilanti, Michigan in Washtenaw County. The university was founded in 1849 as Michigan State Normal School. Several buildings since its founding have achieved historical significance and eventually establishing it on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The district was established in 1984. ==The district== The Eastern Michigan University Historic District is set on an \\"L-shaped parcel\\" of land across from the Ypsilanti Water Tower (also on the NRHP). The EMUHD area contains Welch Hall, Starkweather hall, Sherzer Hall, and McKenny Hall. All four buildings are unique in their design and make up. The four buildings are all substantial structures. Each building has a unique style and structure design. Beyond this each building was built at different times to serve unique purposes for the campus. The district was established in 1984. ==Buildings== McKenny Hall McKenny Hall Previously called McKenny Union and Charles McKenny Union, was the first student union on the campus of a teachers' college when it opened in 1931. McKenny hall was designed by Detroit architect Frank Eurich Jr. of Detroit. The building, in the collegiate gothic style with some art deco features. Today the building is known as McKenny Hall and is home to veteran services, human resources, and career services. After The EMU Student Center opened, McKenny closed in 2006 for renovations to preserve the building's age. Since then the university uses the historic building as office space for various departments. Sherzer Hall Sherzer Hall Sherzer Hall is classroom building, which currently also houses Art Department studios. Sherzer Observatory, an astronomical observatory owned and operated by the Department of Physics and Astronomy, was established in 1878 with a gift from the citizens of Ypsilanti of a four-inch (102 mm) refractor. The observatory, originally located on Pierce Hall, was hit by a tornado and destroyed in 1893. It was then relocated to the roof of the new Natural Science Building in 1903. The architect of the building was E. W.. Arnold of Battle Creek. The building has survived two fires, in 1973 and 1989. Starkweather Hall Starkweather Hall Starkweather Hall, c.1899 Starkweather Hall is the oldest building still standing on EMU's campus. Originally built for the Student Christian Association by a local philanthropist, Mrs. Starkweather. Eventually the building was given to the university and has housed various academic offices and programs. Today, the building is home to the Honors College. In parts of the building, the original doorknobs remain, bearing the initials \\"SCA\\" for the Student Christian Association. Architecture Starkweather is a red-brick exteriors with random Ashlar and clay tile cladding. The building is designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style. Starkweather Hall was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Buildings that sit near Starkweather Hall include Welch Hall, McKenny Hall, and Sherzer Hall. Honors college The EMU Honors Program started in 1984 with approximately 230 students. The program started under the guidance of Robert Holkeboer who was the dean of the Graduate School. In July 2005 the program became a college within the university. Today Honors Housing is in Downing Hall. Past locations included Wise Hall, Jones, and Goddard Halls. Today the Honors College Office are housed in Starkweather Hall. Welch Hall Welch Hall Welch Hall, c. 1899 Welch Hall was constructed in 1895 and was completed three days after Starkweather Hall. Welch Hall is the second oldest building on the EMU campus. The building is named after Adonijah S. Welch. Welch served as the First President of Normal Training School. The building is designed after Georgian Revival Architecture style Architecture. The building's original name was the \\"Training School\\" and served as the Teacher Training School from 1896 to the 1960s. During the building's lifetime, Welch has served as classroom space and various department offices. A wing next to McKinny Union was removed in the late 1960s. Due to poor maintenance the building was closed during the 1980s and almost demolished, but was saved by the \\"Don't Squelsh Welsh\\" movement originating in the university's historic preservation program. Architecture Welch has red-brick exteriors while Starkweather Hall has random ashlar masonry and clay tile cladding. Welch hall is a Georgian Revival style. Sherzer's no-nonsense exterior has a few mildly Romanesque and Georgian elements but defies stylistic classification, McKenny Hall's detailing is Art Deco but the structure alone is Tudor Revival. In 1984, Welch Hall was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Today, Welch Hall houses EMU's executive offices which includes the Office of the President. Welch Hall is the second oldest building on campus by three days behind Starkweather Hall. ==External links== * Virtual historic tour of EMU * Chronological historic tour of EMU * ==See also== * Eastern Michigan University * Ypsilanti Water Tower * Pease Auditorium ==References== # Category:Buildings at Eastern Michigan University Category:Student activity centers in the United States Category:Art Deco architecture in Michigan Category:Eastern Michigan University Category:1931 establishments in Michigan Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:National Register of Historic Places in Washtenaw County, Michigan ","title":"Eastern Michigan University Historic District"},{"id":"35294279","text":"In the context of wavelength-division multiplexing, an alien wavelength is a \\"colored\\" optical signal that is originated from equipment not under the direct control of the transmission network operator. This technique was first mentioned in 2009. Alien Wave transport involves transparent transmission of colored optical channels over pre-existing third-party physical infrastructure. In other words, Alien Wave transport implies an innovative spectrum utilization arrangement between an optical infrastructure owner and a bandwidth crippled customer. The fact that multiple providers co-exist and utilize the common fiber and optical layer infrastructure turns out to be a viable and cost-effective way to scale-up network capacity through minimal capital and operational investments. A practical example of an Alien Wave implementation is one where network resources owned by one carrier are being utilized to transport optical channels that are in the control of a secondary carrier. The possibility of Alien Wave insertion without any impact to existing services has resulted in a rapid acceptance of this technology by the telecom service provider community. == References  See also == * Dark fiber Category:Fiber-optic communications ","title":"Alien wavelength"},{"id":"35294281","text":"The 1985 Can Am season was the eighteenth and penultimate running of the Sports Car Club of America's prototype series and the ninth running of the revived series.

Although the number of deportations is declining with 61,034 registered cases in 2011, the Mexican government documented over 200,000 illegal border crossings in 2004 and 2005. The largest source of illegal immigrants in Mexico are the impoverished Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador bordering Mexico to the southeast. ==Texas in the 1830s== Immigration from the United States was banned in 1830 under the First Mexican Republic, in an attempt to stop large numbers of white Americans from setting up cotton plantations using slave labor (which had recently been banned in Mexico). A cotton price spike and the economic success of plantations in Mississippi (which also exploited enslaved people) created strong economic incentives for illegal immigration. Several areas in northern Mexico fought the central government and declared independence. With a substantial number of white American settlers, the independent Republic of Texas quickly sought (and achieved in 1845) annexation to the United States. ==Migration Law of 2011== Prior to May 2011, Mexico's immigration policy was regulated by the highly strict General Law of Population of 1970, which had been portrayed in hypocritical light when compared to immigration policies as in the US states of Arizona or Alabama. However, on May 24, 2011, President Felipe Calderón signed the new and much more liberal Migration Law. The Mexican Senate and the House had unanimously approved the migration bill on February 24 and April 29, respectively. Some of the most significant principles in this new law included new rights for migrants. The new law guarantees that foreigners and Mexican nationals will receive equal treatment under Mexican law and decriminalizes undocumented immigration, reducing it to an administrative infraction, punishable with a fine of up to 100 days' worth of minimum wage. Under this equality principle all immigrants, regardless of status, nationality, or ethnicity, are granted the right to education and healthcare and are entitled to due process. Elements aimed at promoting family unity were also added. Moreover, before the government takes action (e.g. deportation) with respect to migrant children and other vulnerable individuals (women, seniors, the disabled and victims of crime), their specific needs must be prioritized and adequate services must be provided. Migrants are also granted judicial rights that they were previously denied, such as the right to due process. In addition, the law also calls for establishing a Center for Trust Evaluation and Control which will be charged with the task of training and certifying immigration personnel in hopes of curtailing corrupt practices. All Institute of Migration officials are to meet the same standards as the rest of the country's security agencies. Government officials found to be violating the law are now subject to penalties, including fines and imprisonment. ==General Law of Population== With the Mexican government’s intent to control migration flows and attract foreigners who can contribute to economic development, the new migration law simplifies foreigners’ entrance and residence requirements. First, it replaces the two large immigration categories (immigrant and non-immigrant) with the categories of “visitor” and “temporary resident\\". The status of “permanent resident” is maintained. In the General Law of Population the two categories incorporate over 30 different types of foreigners—i.e. distinguished visitor, religious minister, etc.—each with its own stipulations and requirements to qualify for entry and stay. Under the new law the requirements are simplified, basically differentiating those foreigners who are allowed to work and those who are not. The law also expedites the permanent resident application process for retirees and other foreigners. For granting permanent residency, the law proposes using a point system based on factors such as level of education, employment experience, and scientific and technological knowledge.Gonzalez- Murphy, Laura. \\"Protecting Immigrant Rights in Mexico: Understanding the State-Civil Society Nexus,\\" Routledge, New York, Forthcoming 2013 The specifics for the points system were established in the Law's regulations—Articles 124 to 127 of the Regulations—published on September 28, 2012. According to Article 81 of the Law and Article 70 of the regulations to the law, immigration officials are the only ones that can conduct immigration procedures although the Federal Police may assist but only under the request and guidance of the Institute of Migration. Verification procedures cannot be conducted in migrant shelters run by civil society organizations or by individuals that engage in providing humanitarian assistance to immigrants. ==Texas== In the 1820s, some people from the Northern and Eastern United States entered Mexico illegally. Mexico did have legal immigration through empresario contacts. The reason for this was to create a buffer between Mexico and the growing United States. At first they tried to convince Mexicans to move into Texas. However, Texas was dominated by the warlike Comanche Native Americans. Mexican families did not want to move to Texas and risk their families lives. Mexico then offered cheap land to Anglos from the United States. These legal immigrants had to agree to live under the Mexican Constitution of 1824. Mexican Texas was bordered by the U.S. frontier areas of Louisiana and Arkansas, had the most settlement by American illegal immigrants. When Mexico realized that illegal immigration was out of control they attempted to shut it down. Mexican Texas had a population of 3,000 illegal immigrants by 1823; most of those immigrants were from the Southern United States or Appalachia. By 1825, Mexico and the Coahuila y Tejas territory legalized immigration under the condition that settlers convert to Roman Catholicism and not own slaves. However, as the settler population expanded to 7,000 and did not assimilate with Mexican culture, Mexico banned American immigration again in 1830. However, by 1835, American immigration increased to 1,000 per month. Santa Anna did away with the Mexican Constitution of 1824. Many violations under his dictatorship led to tensions and eventually the outbreak of a revolution. Texas became independent from Mexico in 1836.Woodard, Colin. American Nations: A History of the Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America. New York City: Penguin, 2011. . pp. 209-211. ==Foreign relations== In October 2004, the Hechos newscast of TV Azteca reported that the National Institute of Migration (INM) in Mexico raided strip clubs and deport foreigners who worked in such clubs without the proper documentations. In 2004, the INM deported 188,000 people at a cost of US$10 million Cuba Illegal immigration of Cubans through Cancún tripled from 2004 to 2006. United States The Mexican government has been accused of hypocrisy in terms of illegal immigration, criticizing the United States government for its treatment of illegal immigrants whilst their laws are considerably harsher by comparison. Guatemala In 2006, Joseph Contreras profiled the issue of Guatemalan immigrants illegally entering Mexico for Newsweek magazine and claimed that while Mexican president Vicente Fox urged that the United States grant legal residency to millions of undocumented Mexican immigrants, Mexico had only granted legal status to 15,000 undocumented immigrants. Additionally, Contreras found that at coffee farms in the Mexican state Chiapas, \\"40,000 Guatemalan field hands endure backbreaking jobs and squalid living conditions to earn roughly [US]$3.50 a day\\" and that some farmers \\"even deduct the cost of room and board from that amount.\\" The Mexican National Institute of Migration estimated that 400,235 people crossed the Guatemala–Mexico border illegally every year and that around 150,000 of them intended to enter the United States. The illegal immigration from Mexico's southern neighbors is proving to be a headache for both Mexico and the United States, which has seen an increase in illegal immigration from Central America while Mexican migration has fallen to about net zero. Most Central Americans in Mexico and the United States hail from Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, with a small number from Nicaragua. Amnesty international indicates that 60% of women migrants are sexually assaulted while in transit via Mexico to the United States.The Globe and Mail: \\"Southern exposure: The costly border plan Mexico won’t discuss\\" by Stephanie Nolen January 5, 2017 On 14 September 2018, US media reported that Jacklyn the 7-year-old from Guatemala had died while in custody of US Customs. 7-year-old migrant girl taken into Border Patrol custody dies of dehydration, exhaustion ==Public opinion== A 2019 survey sponsored by The Washington Post and Mexico’s newspaper Reforma gathered information on public opinion regarding illegal immigration to Mexico. It was conducted through July 9 to July 14, 2019, among 1,200 Mexicans adults and was done across the country in 100 election districts by way of face-to-face interviews. According to the survey, Mexicans are profoundly frustrated with illegal immigrants following a year of increased migration through their country from Central America. The survey demonstrates that only 7% of Mexicans say that Mexico should provide residency to Central American immigrants, while another 33% support allowing them to temporarily stay in Mexico while the United States comes to a decision regarding their admittance. However, a 55% majority say that illegal immigrants should be deported back to their home countries. These findings disprove the perception that Mexico is supportive towards the swell of Central Americans. The data results instead suggest that Mexicans are opposed against the migrants traversing through their country, a sentiment shared by numerous supporters of President Trump. The Post-Reforma survey finds that more than 6 in 10 Mexicans say that migrants pose a burden on their country because they take jobs as well as benefits that should belong to Mexicans; and a 55% majority of Mexicans support deporting migrants traveling through Mexico to reach the United States. The face-to-face survey was conducted among Mexican adults after a dramatic increase in Mexico’s immigration enforcement following an agreement made in June with the United States. Among the less of half of Mexicans who are aware of the June agreement, 34% are opposed while 59% are in favor. Several analysts had predicted the base for the President of Mexico Andrés Manuel López Obrador to be disillusioned when he agreed to heighten Mexico’s immigration enforcement. But the poll instead suggests that the new approach has subtracted very little from Obrador’s popularity. He currently maintains a strong 70% job approval rating eight months after assuming office. A 54% majority saying that Obrador is standing up for the interests of Mexico in his dealings with the United States and immigration. Furthermore, 51% of Mexicans support utilizing the country’s recently formed National Guard to repel the migration of illegal immigrants in Mexico. The Mexican National Guard was launched by López Obrador and has played a major part in the intensifying of immigration enforcement. A 53% majority of Mexicans have voiced their trust in the national guard, with two-thirds of Mexicans saying that they would like the national guard to be in their city, whereas 45% report that they feel more safe with the domestic force. In July 2019, the governors of three northern Mexican states; Coahuila, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas, signed a statement announcing that they could not accept any more migrants. Governor Miguel Ángel Riquelme Solís of Coahuila stated, \\"The number [of migrants] that the federal government is talking about is impossible for us to deal with.\\" Guatemalans are set comprise the largest group of migrants apprehended at the United States border this year. By nationality, it would be the very first time in modern history when Mexicans do not make up the largest migrant group. The Post-Reforma poll finds that a mere 2% of Mexicans deem immigration their country’s most important problem, with a 55% majority naming insecurity. Another 9% each mentioning corruption and unemployment, 7% cite the economy, and lastly 4% each who say that poverty, political and social problems are Mexico’s primary concerns. ==See also== * Immigration to Mexico * Law of Mexico * Illegal immigration to the United States ==References== Category:Immigration to Mexico Mexico Category:Mexican law ","title":"Illegal immigration to Mexico"},{"id":"35294421","text":"HNoMS Hitra, Eidsheims old ship, in Scalloway, Shetland June 2003 Ingvald Olsen Eidsheim DSO, DSC (born 27 November 1909 in Hosanger, died 23 February 2000) was a Norwegian sailor and war hero.

He rarely lost a bout in the 1970s, winning five world titles, six European titles, and an Olympics gold medal in 1976. At the 1976 Olympics he pinned all his five opponents, in total spending less than 17 minutes on the mat. He was the Soviet flag bearer and a clear favorite at the Moscow Olympics, but injured an Achilles tendon in the second bout and withdrew from the tournament. He recovered by 1984, when he won his last Soviet title and was selected for the 1984 Games, but could not compete because of the 1984 Summer Olympics boycott by the Soviet Union. He retired from competitions to become a wrestling coach n Moscow. In 2006 he was inducted into the FILA International Wrestling Hall of Fame. Balboshin was born in East Germany, where his father, a career military officer, was serving at the time. He is married to Nina Balboshina and has a son Nikolai (born 1973) and a daughter Yelena (born 1979). He took up wrestling when his family moved to Moscow and trained together with his elder brother Vladimir. His career was marred by injuries. In the 1960s he broke his arm at a junior wrestling competition. In 1972 he was included to the Soviet national team to compete at the 1972 European championships and Summer Olympics, but lost that season after tearing a knee tendon. He won the Soviet, European and world titles in 1973 while recovering from a shoulder injury, which also bothered him next year when he lost the European championships final to Kamen Goranov. In 1975 he won the European title, but injured a hip at the world championships and placed fourth. ==References * Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Potsdam Category:East German people of Russian descent Category:Soviet male sport wrestlers Category:Olympic wrestlers of the Soviet Union Category:Wrestlers at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:Wrestlers at the 1980 Summer Olympics Category:Russian male sport wrestlers Category:Olympic gold medalists for the Soviet Union Category:Olympic medalists in wrestling Category:Medalists at the 1976 Summer Olympics Category:European Wrestling Championships medalists Category:World Wrestling Championships medalists ","title":"Nikolay Balboshin"},{"id":"35294672","text":"Omphile Abel Ramela (born 14 March 1988) is a South African cricketer. A left- handed batsman and left-arm orthodox spin bowler, he made his first-class debut for Gauteng in December 2007 before joining Boland the following month. He also represented the Cape Cobras on several occasions between 2009 and 2010. He was included in the Western Province cricket team squad for the 2015 Africa T20 Cup.Northerns Squad / Players – ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 31 August 2015. Ramela has often found himself under fire for stirring up racist division within his own country of South Africa despite being a beneficiary of the controversial quota system in South Africa. Recently c.July 2020 Ramela penned an open letter to the South African sports minister in which he claimed 'As a professional athlete, I did not get to reach the peak of my potential therefore my career, up to the point where my career abruptly ended because of this lawlessness'. Unfortunately for Ramela, cricket, like many other sports has clearly defined KPI's and performance metrics which show clearly that Ramela was not up to scratch as a domestic cricketer. In this day and age one needs to be very careful of listening to people in leadership positions as they are perceived as 'informed' or 'educated'. Ramela is a perfect example of a false prophet, someone who has been given everything on a silver platter but still has the impudence to complain about a system which has been emperically proven to benefit him. In September 2017, he played his 100th first-class match, when he played for Highveld Lions against Warriors in the 2017–18 Sunfoil Series.

The Chinese government has instituted policies against illegal immigration, particularly from North Korean refugees and defectors and Africans in Guangzhou. ==Policies== The Chinese government actively discourages this type of behavior out of fears that it may cause instability in the region and encourage more illegal immigration. In 2003, campaigns against illegal immigration were conducted in Guangdong and other Chinese provinces, and around 2008, the police repeatedly conducted so-called \\"hurricane\\" campaigns against illegal immigration in Guangdong. Guangzhou Since 2004 at the latest, illegal immigration has increasingly come into the focus of the police authorities in Guangzhou, primarily targeted against immigrants from African countries, and later throughout the country. In Guangzhou, a regulation has been in force since 2004 under which citizens are requested to report cases suspected of illegal immigration to the police, which can be rewarded with for information that leads to successful expulsions. According to Reuters in 2009, there were as many as 100,000 Africans and Arabs in Guangzhou, mostly illegal overstayers. In 2012, the legal framework on exit-entry administration was amended and the new regulations featured extended power of the local police in immigration issues, higher sanctions against illegal stay and illegal employment as well as revised rules regarding deportation.

Ambassador Sinha is a public speaker on international security, Afghanistan-Pakistan-Iran and environmental diplomacy. He is the author of Legitimacy of Power: The Permanence of Five in the Security Council (2018, Vij Books). The book traces the origins of international security cooperation and scrutinizes the moorings of the UN Security Council's powers in international law. Dilip Sinha was head of India's UN affairs during its membership of the Security Council in the eventful period, 2011–2012. He was ambassador to the UN in Geneva, where he was elected Vice President of the UN Human Rights Council in 2014 and Vice Chairman of the South Centre. Sinha steered India's response to the crises in Libya and Syria in the Security Council and to Sri Lanka in the Human Rights Council. During his diplomatic career, Sinha headed India's relations with Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran and served in Germany, Egypt, Pakistan, Brazil, Bangladesh, and Greece. Sinha currently serves on the board of the Asian Development Research Institute Society and The Tribhuvan School. == Indian Foreign Service == Dilip Sinha is a member of the 1978 batch of the Indian Foreign Service. He served as India's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva from 2012 to 2014 and as India's Ambassador to Greece from 2007 to 2010. As part of his multilateral assignments, Sinha represented India in its three-year term on the United Nations Human Rights Council and was the first Indian to be elected as Vice- President of the Human Rights Council Bureau. Sinha was also elected Vice Convener of the South Centre Council of Representatives in Geneva. Prior to taking up his assignment in Geneva, Sinha served as Special Secretary for International Organizations and Environmental Diplomacy in the Government of India. He was responsible for coordinating India diplomacy at the multilateral level, including its 2011–2012 term on the UN Security Council and on climate change negotiations.

The book traces the origins of international security cooperation and scrutinizes the moorings of the UN Security Council's powers in international law. It critiques the permanent five's manipulation of the Council to aggressively strengthen their global dominance and legitimise their exercise of power. The book is considered an essential read for practitioners and scholars to understand the Security Council and the failure to reform it. Notable reviews include that of: Shyam Saran, India's Foreign Secretary (2004-2006) Dilip Sinha combines his rich experience in multilateral diplomacy with meticulous research to produce an outstanding work on the United Nations Security Council and its evolving role in international security. Betty E. King, US Ambassador to the UN in Geneva (2009-2013) The cover of The Legitimacy of Power is an apt reflection of the operations of the United Nations. Despite its increase in country memberships across the globe since its inception, the most powerful and important arm of the organization, i.e. the Security Council, has resisted numerical changes in its permanent memberships. Legitimacy of power should be an apt beginning for the legitimacy of change. Vijay K. Nambiar, Chef de Cabinet to the UN Secretary-General (2007-2012) An impressive work. Has historical detail, legal rigor as well as a nuanced awareness of the normative compulsions and practical politics driving this great institution. Sinha rightly warns us that a Security Council rendered unpredictable or unreliable by P-5 vagaries could affect its own credibility and ultimately the legitimacy of the UN itself. == Personal life == Dilip Sinha is married to Shrimi Sinha and has two sons. He speaks English, Hindi and German fluently. == Early life and education == Dilip Sinha was born in Kanpur, India.

She was known as the \\"First Lady of East German Jazz\\" and was for a long time the GDR's only jazz singer of note, playing a major role in the dissemination of the music in the country. ==Biography== Born in Eisenach, Thuringia, Germany, Ruth Hohmann (her stage name) as a child took singing and ballet lessons and sang in the school choir. In 1949, she went to acting school in Erfurt. Two years later, she married the theater and film critic Heinz Hofmann and moved to Berlin. When their two children were old enough, she began performing publicly. On 12 November 1961, she made her first appearance as a jazz singer, singing English lyrics, and thereafter made constant appearances at home and abroad with her band the Jazz Optimisten Berlin, until the mid-1960s, when her career stalled because of the ruling politburo's cultural policies. Walter Ulbricht, East Germany's hardline communist ruler between 1949 and 1971, clamped down on anything he felt had links with American imperialism, and while jazz was not officially banned, Hohmann has recalled that \\"we stopped getting bookings. Concerts would be cancelled at the last minute, with promoters giving excuses like 'we haven't got a sound technician'.\\" It was only after Erich Honecker took over as leader of the GDR in 1971 that she was able to resume her performances.Helen Pidd, \\"Ruth Hohmann: the first lady of East German jazz sings again\\", The Guardian, 2 December 2011.

In 1980, she became an üniversite doçenti in Turkey and in 1982, a Privatdozent at the Ruhr-Universität, Bochum. A full professorship at Middle East Technical University followed in 1986. At the end of 1987, she left Ankara after having accepted a professorship at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Munich, where she taught until her retirement in 2007. After a term as a Harris Distinguished Visiting Professor at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire/USA (spring term, 2007), she began to teach at Istanbul Bilgi University, where she was a full- time faculty member until 2017. Becoming an Emerita in 2017, she took up a position at Ibn Haldun University, Istanbul. She was an H.A.R. Gibb Fellow at Harvard University (1983-84), a Fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin (2001-02) and a Visiting Bhagat Singh Professor at the Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi/India (2016). In 1962-63, she arrived at a turning point in her life when she became a student of Ömer Lütfi Barkan, one of the founding fathers of modern Ottoman historiography and a member of the editorial board of Annales ESC. After reading volumes of this journal at Barkan’s recommendation, and Fernand Braudel’s La Méditerranée et le monde méditerranéen à l'époque de Philippe II (Paris, 1949) at a later stage, she felt that this was the type of historiography with which she could identify. Throughout her career, she has focused on the history of Ottoman cities in the period before about 1850. She is particularly concerned with the hitherto underrepresented world of ordinary urbanites, in particular artisans, women, and slaves. This undertaking has often involved reading Ottoman documents ‘against the grain’ in order to tease out the actions and aspirations of the common people from texts, which for the most part, reflect the aims and interests of the sultans and their officials. However, it bears remembering that to denizens of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, large sections of this world continue to remain hidden. == Works ==  English  * Subjects of the Sultan: Culture and Daily Life in the Ottoman Empire (2005) * The Ottoman Empire (2008) * Approaching Ottoman History: An Introduction to the Sources (2000) * Artisans of Empire: Crafts and Craftspeople Under the Ottomans (2009) * The Ottoman Empire and the World Around It (2006) * Coping with the state: Political conflict and crime in the Ottoman Empire, 1550-1720 (1995) * Merchants in the Ottoman Empire (2008) * Pilgrims and Sultans: The Haji under the Ottomans (1994) * Stories of Ottoman Men and Women: Establishing Status, Establishing Control (2002) * Men of Modest Substance: House Owners and House Property in Seventeenth-Century Ankara and Kayseri (2002) * Animals and people in the Ottoman Empire * The Ottomans and the Balkans : a discussion of historiography (2002) Diğer yazar Fikret Adanır. * Crafts and craftsmen of the Middle East: fashioning the individual in the Muslim Mediterranean (2005) Diğer yazar Randi Deguilhem.

Kent is known for his large, expressive and abstract figures in green wood. His large wooden sculptures are carved using a chainsaw with very little use of a chisel or sanding. He occasionally uses a blowtorch to char the wood and produce blackening, or sandblasting to emphasise texture and woodgrain. In the 1980s, clay was Kent's first choice sculpture material. By the 1990s, he had developed a passion for stone carving before beginning his obsession for carving wood with a chainsaw in 2000. Since 2004, Simon has exhibited his work across South Yorkshire and the Midlands including an exhibition at Magna in 2005, and Burghley House Sculpture Park in 2006. ==References== Category:English sculptors Category:English male sculptors Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:People from Worksop Category:Chainsaw sculptors ","title":"Simon Kent"},{"id":"35294926","text":"The Gabardan Solar Park is a 67.5 megawatt (MW) photovoltaic power station in France.

He was a Detective Chief Inspector in Sussex Police, who retired in 2009 after 30 years of service. He joined the Metropolitan Police in 1979, transferring to Sussex Police in 1984. He was a Constable in the Metropolitan Police during the existence of the Special Demonstration Squad [1968 - 2008] ==Police career== In July 2000, he was the Detective Inspector on Highdown Division who dealt with the disappearance of missing child Sarah Payne, who went missing in Littlehampton on the evening of 1 July. Detective Inspector Underhill was appointed as the Deputy SIO (Senior Investigating Officer) of the enquiry, which became a murder investigation after a body was found near Pulborough on 17 July and identified as that of Sarah Payne the following day. Underhill remained on the investigation until Roy Whiting was convicted of Sarah Payne's murder in December 2001 and sentenced to life imprisonment. This alert system is based on Megan's Law in America. Underhill later took this to the Association of Chief Officers (ACPO) Homicide Working Group to ask for the pilot to be introduced nationally, which was achieved by 2006. Underhill was also an adviser [for one day] in the case of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, who were abducted and murdered. He then moved to the Training Department in Sussex Police, having qualified as a police trainer, assessor and verifier. On retirement he moved to Dorset. Underhill went on to campaign for safeguarding issues, including Sarah's Law, which was introduced into Dorset in October 2011. Underhill became the Laymember on his Local Safeguarding Children's Board, as well as becoming a trustee for the Bournefree charity. He is a visiting lecturer at Bournemouth University for the School of Applied Science. In July 2011, Underhill reported to Operation Weeting that he thought his police phone had been hacked during the Sarah Payne murdercase. ==Police and Crime Commissioner== In February 2012, Underhill declared himself as an Independent candidate for the Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner role. In April 2012, Underhill launched his electoral campaign as Keep Politics out of Policing and won the election, becoming Dorset's first ever PCC. In 2013, as Dorset PCC, Underhill was one of three PCC's nominated by their peers to review the role and remit of the Association of Chief Police Officers. The other PCC's who worked with him were Jane Kennedy and Matthew Ellis. The trio commissioned General Jackson to review the organisation. His review recommended substantial changes, including the transition to a new organisation called the National Police Chiefs Council. The trio formed the \\"ACPO Transition Board\\" to achieve the changes working with senior officers from ACPO, the Home Office, MOPAC and the College of Policing. The PCC's appointed Sir Bill Jeffrey as Chair of the Transition Board. This led to the creation of the National Police Chiefs Council formally in April 2015. The first ever Chair was Sara Thornton. In 2014, Underhill became the first PCC nationally to formally commission the charity Victim Support to provide victim services in his area. In July 2015, Underhill announced that he would stand as a candidate in the following year's police and crime commissioner elections. His election manifesto was announced on 30 March 2016. On 6 May, Underhill was re-elected as police and crime commissioner. He received 38% of the first preference votes, and was elected after the second preference votes were counted, when no candidates received more than 50% of first preference votes. The election turnout was 23%. In December 2019, Underhill announced that he will not stand for re-election in 2020. ==References * Official website Category:Living people Category:Detectives and criminal investigators Category:Police and crime commissioners in England Category:British police officers Category:Metropolitan Police officers Category:Independent police and crime commissioners Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Martyn Underhill"},{"id":"35295019","text":"José \\"Pepe\\" Sellés Mas (born 25 October 1993) is a Spanish footballer who plays as a left back. ==Club career== Born in Alicante, Valencian Community, Sellés joined local Hércules CF's youth system at the age of 11.

The parcel occupied 49 hectares of volcanic rocky outcroppings and eroded pyroclasts, with species of pine, Myrica faya and Heather (Erica) scattered throughout the property. It was in this wild brush that the property-owner patiently cultivated and planted wild pines, Cryptomeria, ornamental and exotic plants (such as Hydrangeas and Azaleas), large ferns and Eucalyptus. António do Canto Brum further began to open roads into the area, constructed houses, captured rainwater, and created orchards and pastureland. The new park soon attracted many of the local residences and gained fame in tourist circles, becoming an obligatory stop on pedestrian trails. António do Canto Brum eventually changed the name to Pinhal da Paz. By the 1970s, the descendants of Canto had tried to maintain the character of the park, but the costs of such an endeavour were overwhelming, it slowly returned to wild brush. On 1 July 1982, the regional authority instigated the Reserva de Recreio do Pinhal da Paz, in order to create and implement measures to conserve the park and preserve the character of its greenspaces. The Reserve was to be run by a commission, which was never nominated, and the administration of the park lapsed, resulting in a continued degradation of its spaces. After several starts-and-stops, on 19 September 1988 the Regional Government acquired Pinhal da Paz from the family of António do Canto. Measures to improve the park only began in the VII Regional Government, when it was placed under the umbrella of the Secretaria Regional de Agricultura, Pescas e Ambiente, and administration of the Direcção Regional dos Rescursos Florestais, where it was renamed Reserva Florestal de Recreio Pinhal da Paz (under decree 15/2000/A, 21 June 2000). It was only in 1998 that public works were initiated to recuperate the property, now considerably degenerated, under the new authority of the Direcção Regional. This project, in addition to clearing and transforming the public nature of the park, also introduced new species of endemic species and infrastructures to support visits to the park. ==Geography== The park is located in the central Picos Region of the island of São Miguel, along the border between the parishes of Fajã de Cima and Pico da Pedra. Th reserve occupies 49 hectares aligned along its northern border with the lands of the descendants of Hermano Moniz Feijó (João Manuel Clemente Almeida and Armando Soares Cordeiro), south by the lands held by the descendants of Maria Beatriz Noronha da Costa and Rodolfo Pires de Gouveia, east by the Canada do Valagão and the property owned by the descendants of Maria Cecília Câmara Marques Moreira Dhar and to the west by the Caminho das Criações. ==Infrastructures== From the entrance, accessible from the main gate, the park extends to the northeast and encompasses several differentiated spaces. Parking is located on the dirt plain adjacent to the main gate, while both access roads and pedestrian trails extend further into the bush: the space was designed to accommodate both passenger vehicles and buses. The forest ranger's residence and dependencies are located along the restricted roadway to the main spaces, and houses the forest ranger and his family throughout the year. The rest of the park follows the identifiable pedestrian paths (signposted by various trail markers) to different sections, which include: picnic/barbecue areas, individual public washrooms (for both sexes), animal paddocks (for ducks and deer), a children's playground, a hedge-maze and an open field for other diversions, in addition to a maintenance yard for forest services. In addition, there is a small, simple hermitage near the ranger's residence dedicated to Senhora da Paz (Lady of Peace). To complement the grounds, the Forest Service also constructed small miniature buildings (replicas of many of the real-life buildings) specifically for small children. Many pedestrian trails wind throughout the park, which extend uphill to the two peaks in the park, covering of trails that also includes six individual exercise stations. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * Category:São Miguel Island Category:Parks in the Azores Category:Forest reserves ","title":"Recreational Forest Reserve of Pinhal da Paz"},{"id":"35295096","text":"The Shark Finning Prohibition Act was signed into law by Bill Clinton on December 21, 2000. It had forbidden finning by any vessels in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (up to offshore), and possession of fins by any U.S.-flagged fishing vessels on international waters. It also prohibited any fishing vessel from landing at a U.S. port with shark fins whose weight exceeds 5% of the total weight of shark carcasses landed or on board. These provisions left loopholes that would successfully be exploited in its first court test. ==Legislative history== was introduced on October 12, 2000, by Rep. Randy (Duke) Cunningham (R-CA) with no co-sponsors. It was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources, which then referred it Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs on October 20, 2000. Ten days later, it was brought up on motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill, and was agreed to by voice vote. On October 31, 2000, H.R. 5461 was received in the Senate, which passed the bill by unanimous consent on December 7, 2000. It was signed into law by Bill Clinton on December 21, 2000, during his final weeks in office. ==Background== Shark finning refers to the practice of cutting the fins from live sharks while at sea, and then discarding rest of the fish back into the ocean. If they are still alive, the sharks either die from suffocation or are eaten because they are unable to move normally. Shark finning is widespread, and largely unregulated and unmonitored. The practice has been on the rise largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for shark fin soup and traditional cures, particularly in China and its territories. According to WildAid in 2007, \\"the rapidly expanding and largely unregulated shark fin trade represents one of the most serious threats to shark populations worldwide, and shark fins are now among the most expensive seafood products in the world, commonly retailing at US$400 per kg, with the most expensive selling for US$1,000 per kg.\\" According to Discovery News, \\"[u]p to 73 million sharks are killed annually for their lucrative fins.\\" During the congressional discussion, Shark finning was called \\"one of the most visible and controversial conservation issues in the waters of the Pacific Ocean\\". While the practice of finning had already been banned in Federal waters of the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean, as well as waters in 11 coastal States, it remained unregulated in the Pacific. This legislation was designed to address that problem. According to the bill's proponent, the bill was \\"strongly supported by the Ocean Wildlife Campaign, a coalition that includes the Center for Marine Conservation, National Audubon Society, National Coalition for Marine Conservation, Natural Resources Defense Council, Wildlife Conservation Society, and the World Wildlife Fund. In addition, it is supported by the State of Hawaii Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the American Sportfishing Association, the Recreational Fishing Alliance, the Sportfishing Association of California, the Cousteau Society, and the Western Pacific Fisheries Coalition.\\" ==Provisions== The Act made it illegal to: # remove any of the fins of a shark (including the tail) and discard the carcass of the shark at sea; # have custody, control, or possession of any such fin aboard a fishing vessel without the corresponding carcass; or # land any such fin without the corresponding carcass. By way of definition, the Act created a \\"rebuttable presumption that any shark fins landed from a fishing vessel or found on board a fishing vessel were taken, held, or landed in violation ... if the total weight of shark fins landed or found on board exceeds 5 percent of the total weight of shark carcasses landed or found on board.\\" alt=Small tied bales of flat gray objects, the shark fins, messily stacked underneath a translucent tent-like roof between white walls. ==Court test== During debate on the bill, Del. Eni Faleomavaega (D-AS), had pointed out that nothing in it banned the transshipment of shark fins by American-flagged ships. Vessels that merely bought fins that had been taken by other vessels, a common practice, could not be prosecuted. His concern was resolved with an amendment that relied on the definition of \\"fishing vessel\\" in the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This included not only those engaged in fishing but vessels that \\"aided and assisted\\" such fishing, including the refrigeration, storage and transport of fish. Congress believed that language was sufficient.Rahall, Nick; ; United States House Committee on Natural Resources, p. 3; July 8, 2008; retrieved April 1, 2012. Two years later, that belief would be tested in court. In August 2002, the destroyer USS Fife, patrolling international waters off the coast of Guatemala, intercepted the King Diamond II, a U.S.-flagged, Hong Kong-based former fishing trawler. A Coast Guard detachment with the Fife was sent aboard to investigate, and found of shark fins rotting in various locations on board, without any corresponding carcasses. The KD II was escorted to San Diego, where the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Office of Law Enforcement finished the investigation. The ship's owner, captain and charterer were fined over $600,000 for the largest shark fin arrest ever. But in 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the fins returned. Judge Stephen Reinhardt held for a three-judge panel that a vessel carrying shark fins that it had purchased from other vessels on the high seas did not come under the act since purchasing the fins did not constitute aid or assistance to those who had taken them; thus the fins had not been seized lawfully.United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins, 520 F.3d 976, (9th Cir., 2008). To close the loophole, Congress passed the Shark Conservation Act of 2010, which was signed into law by President Barack Obama on January 4, 2011.H.R. 81: Shark Conservation Act of 2009 (GovTrack.us): ==Legislative Summary== {  - !

It is located in Nakhodka in the Russian Far East and is part of the Centre for Outer Space Monitoring, the space surveillance section of the Russian Space Forces. Krona-N is the second Krona, the first Krona is in Zelenchukskaya in the North Caucasus. ==History== Krona-N was mentioned in a 1980 report by Soviet military contractor Vympel on the future development of the Soviet system of space monitoring and control. This report stated that the Krona in Zelenchukskaya should be completed and proposed the development of Krona-N in the far east, and a complex called Krona-V (). Krona-V was to detect space craft in high earth orbits, and Krona-N to detect craft in low earth orbits. Work on Krona-N stopped in the mid 1980s but restarted sometime later. In 2005 it was described as being under construction and in late 2007 the then Space Forces commander Vladimir Popovkin was quoted as saying it would be commissioned in 2008. ==Facility== Krona complexes have been described as counter-intelligence facilities which identify and study hostile military satellites. The first Krona in Zelechukskaya is on two sites with an optical telescope and a LIDAR as well as two radars. Krona-N has no optical component, it is on one site and entirely radar based. In common with Krona in Zelechukskaya there are two radars on this site. The largest one, the tree-like antenna giving the facility its name,from the crown of a tree, krona dereva is a decimeter band (UHF)Russian sources describe this as being in UHF channel A phased array radar designed by NIIDAR.

Solar PV generated 766 gigawatt-hours, or about 1.4% of the country's final electricity consumption. As with most other European countries, 99.5 percent of all solar power systems are connected to the electrical grid. The nation's installed PV capacity by inhabitant (watt-peak per capita) stood at 91 watts, still below the European Union's 2014-average of 172 watts. Photovoltaic deployment in Austria had been rather modest for many years, while in other European countries, such as Germany, Italy and Spain, installations were booming with new records year after year. However, in an overall declining European solar market, annual PV deployment jumped beyond 100 megawatt in 2012 and remained above that level at 263 MW and 140 MW for 2013 and 2014, respectively. The European Photovoltaic Industry Association forecasts, that Austria, together with other mid-sized countries, will contribute significantly to European PV deployment in the coming years. In 2009, the site of Zwentendorf power station became Austria's largest solar power station with an investment of 1.2 million Euro, with the addition of 1,000 photovoltaic panels.History Zwentendorf was intended to be Austria's first nuclear power plant, but after a vote in 1978 prohibiting nuclear power in Austria, was never completed.Austrian Nuclear Plant Becomes Solar Power Station In September, 2011, Austria's largest solar power station, 2 MW, was under construction in the Niedere Tauern mountain range.Albasolar provides 2MW for the largest solar Park in Austria Austria has also a large capacity of solar heating at its disposal.

Indiana originally planned to play a second game against Purdue in West Lafayette, but according to the Arbutus (the Indiana school yearbook) those games were \\"declared off, and the season ended at Indiana.\\" The official records of Indiana and Purdue indicate that Indiana lost to Purdue 23–19 in West Lafayette on March 15, 1901.

The riding was a dual riding in that it elected two members to the Ontario provincial legislature. ==Boundaries== In 1914 the riding was created out of parts of the Toronto South and Toronto East ridings. It bordered Toronto Harbour on the south. From the western border it followed Simcoe Street north to Queen Street West where it jogged a block east to University Avenue. It went north along University to College Street. It then went east following College until it turned into Carlton Street at Yonge Street. It continued east along Carlton until it reached Parliament Street. It turned south until Gerrard Street East and then went east along Gerrard until it reached Logan Avenue.

Rebuilt by King Christian IV into the Renaissance style in 1610, it was in use until 1728 when it was destroyed in the first Great Fire of Copenhagen. It was replaced by a new city hall which was built on its foundations the same year. ==Building== The new city hall at Gammeltorv was built as a replacement for the previous city hall located in Nørregade, at the site of the current Bishop's House, which was now taken over by the new Copenhagen University. It was built on the south side of the Gammeltorv but nothing is known about the appearance of the building during this early phase of its history. The City Hall after the rebuilding as seen from Nytorv When King Christian IV ascended to the throne in 1588, it was with ambitions to strengthen Copenhagen's strategic role in the Baltic region and he soon embarked on a number of building projects such as the new Arsenal Dock, Rosenborg Castle, and the Børsen. The modest city hall, although still a relatively small building, was from 1608 to 1610 subject to a comprehensive adaptation into the Renaissance style to better match these new buildings. Erik Pontoppidan refers to it as a \\"new building\\". A projecting, octagonal staircase tower topped by a spire was built in the middle of the façade towards Gammeltorv. The tower had a Dutch gable on either side. The same gables were seen on the rear of the building, flanking a smaller tower. Also on the rear of the building, there was an open gallery beneath an external balcony. ==Use== Peder Hansen Resen, who was appointed lord mayor of Copenhagen in 1664, wrote several works about the history of Denmark and of Copenhagen. He is the principal source of knowledge about the use of the city hall. The byting, the governing assembly of the city, began to meet indoors in 1623, first in a small building on the square and from 1662 in the city hall. The building also contained a theatre. The cellar was used as a jail as well as a drinking establishment serving beer and wine. ==References Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1479 Category:Renaissance architecture in Copenhagen Category:Former buildings and structures in Copenhagen Category:City and town halls in Copenhagen ","title":"Copenhagen City Hall (1479–1728)"},{"id":"35295252","text":"Voltage is an unincorporated community in Harney County, Oregon, United States.

On the right side are two people with wheeled suitcases behind them Irregular immigration to Canada (also called undocumented immigration to Canada or illegal immigration to Canada, though this terminology is contested) is the act of a person who is not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident entering or remaining in Canada in a manner contrary to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and its associated regulations. This includes persons who entered Canada on a travel visa but remained beyond the period of stay specified, as well as persons who entered Canada without presenting themselves at a port of entry. Canada is a signatory of the United Nations' 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, which forbids imposition of penalties on refugees who may have entered in contravention to national laws in order to seek protection; this only applies to claimants while their case is being processed and to persons formally recognised as refugees. ==Terminology== The use of the term irregular or illegal is disputed when referring to the act of crossing the Canada–United States border outside of a point of entry (POE) to claim asylum. Entering Canada outside of a POE is not an offence under the Criminal Code or Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA); regulations under IRPA only require that a person seeking to enter Canada outside a POE to \\"appear without delay\\" at the nearest entry point. While entering Canada outside of a port of entry may represent an unlawful act, section 133 of IRPA requires that charges related to any offences associated with entering Canada are stayed while an entrant's claim is being processed in accordance with the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. If the Canadian government grants refugee status, any charges are stayed permanently. Claimants may face charges for other unlawful activity, or background checks may determine the claimant has a criminal history or presents a national security risk, which are outside the scope of the section 133 staying of charges and may result in denial of a claim. The Government of Canada, including the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB), use the term irregular to refer to these border crossings. Refugee organizations, the Liberal Party of Canada, and the New Democratic Party also use this term. The Conservative Party of Canada, in contrast, use the term illegal, with the justification that entering outside of a port of entry is a violation of the Customs Act. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police use neither word, instead using the term interceptions. ==Irregular immigration== Canada is signatory to the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, and within Canada, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) is the legislation that governs the flow of people. IRPA, established in 2003, outlines the ruling, laws, and procedures associated with immigrants within Canada. It provides officers of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) with the authority to detain permanent residents and foreign nationals if any of the individuals have violated the rulings of the Act. Roughly 12,600 individuals who were living in Canada including 1,900 criminals who violated this Act and either posed a high risk to Canada or were illegal immigrants who were deported in the year of 2006-07. Article 31 of the UN Refugee Convention says that receiving countries may not penalize refugees for how they enter a country as long as they present themselves “without delay” to authorities and show “good cause” for their presence.Goodwin-Gill, G. S. 2008. \\"Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees\\" and \\"Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees.\\" United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law 6. Illegal entry is not an offence in Canada’s Criminal Code, however Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations 27 (2) says that anyone who does not enter at a port of entry must check in “without delay” at a border point. As clarified by James Hathaway, founding director of the University of Michigan's program in refugee and asylum law, “If someone a) comes forward voluntarily, and b) explains that the reason they crossed the border illegally was they were looking for protection, it’s clear as a bell: You may not under any circumstance penalize them.” An asylum seeker would be considered in violation of IRPA if they cross at an unofficial border point, and does not promptly go to a port of entry and doesn’t file a refugee claim. In addition to potential criminal charges if a refugee seeker' asylum is rejected. ==Legal immigration== Canadian Immigration Stamp Canada has an immigration program that is established for every migrant wishing to live in Canada. This program seeks individuals who will have the highest chances of providing positive input into the Canadian economy. As of 2017, Canada has a number of immigration programs through which migrants can legally enter Canada: * Federal Skilled Worker * Canadian Provincial Nominee Program * Canadian Business Immigration * Canadian Experience Class * Family Class Sponsorship The new Federal Skilled Worker Program (FSWP) measures the capabilities of individuals who are required to meet a passing mark, in order to have their application accepted. Currently, the passing mark is 67 out of 100 in six categories: education, work experience, language, age, arranged employment, and adaptability (e.g., any previous work or education acquired within Canada). In addition, migrants may legally enter and apply for temporary resident status under the terms and conditions of the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of which Canada is a co-writer and signatory. It is this class of entrant that draws the most controversy. ==Statistics== From January 2017 to March 2018, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police intercepted 25,645 people crossing the border into Canada illegally. Public Safety Canada estimated that another 2,500 came across in April 2018 for a total of just over 28,000, of which 1,000 had been removed from Canada. Federal government ministers expected that \\"close to 90 per cent\\" of asylum claimants would be rejected. The last audit of the Canadian population was performed in 2004 that indicated approximately 36,000 more individuals over a span of 6 years became illegal residents within Canada. These statistics are considered inaccurate because Canada does not record the information of illegal individuals leaving the country, but it is the last authentic value provided. A federal government draft report from 2001 included an estimate of 100,000 illegal immigrants then residing in Canada. (article date and news agency as The Canadian Press per alternate URL reference, accessed 9 October 2018) In the 1980s, large numbers of Brazilian foreign nationals would arrive in Canada claiming refugee statuses. They would then reside until the end of their refugee process which allowed them to study, work, and collect social benefits. Canada noticed the large trend and imposed a requirement in 1987 of Brazilian foreign nationals needing to attain a visa in order to arrive in Canada, making it a little more difficult for many to immigrate. During their stay, these foreign nationals would develop the skills to pass the Canadian immigration tests, and become Canadian legal citizens. Those who would not pass the citizenship tests would either leave back to Brazil, or continue to live as illegal residents. In 2008, Auditor General of Canada Sheila Fraser found that the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) had lost track of 41,000 individuals who had been ordered deported. In cases, individuals can be allowed a temporary access into Canada with a Temporary Resident Permit as long as they do not pose an obvious threat to Canadians. The permit can be issued by the CBSA or a border service officer for a cost of $200 per permit; the CBSA issued 13,412 permits in 2006. Permits allow legal residency for a period ranging from one day to three years. During this time period, the legal documents are gathered for individuals to be deported back to the country they emigrated from. This procedure at times could create challenges such as retrieving the legal documentation for deporting, hence the Temporary Resident Permits are provided enough time for such obstacles to be overcome efficient and effectively. border between Lacolle, Quebec and Champlain, NY, in 2017alt=A dead end road at left from which a tall metal pole with many devices attached rises, in an area surrounded by low trees under a blue sky with clouds.

In 2017, after U.S. President Donald Trump had enforced American laws against illegal immigration in the U.S., immigrants leaving the U.S. and entering Canada increased. Quebec saw 75% of the resulting crossings from the U.S. for Canada, and Programme régional d’accueil et d’intégration des demandeurs d’asile (PRAIDA) helped 1,174 asylum seekers in July 2017 compared to the 180 people during the previous year. Montreal had to re-purpose its Olympic Stadium to house the immigrants. Public opinion A 2007 poll conducted for Citizenship and Immigration Canada of 1,200 telephone interviews of adult Canadians gathered feedback on positive and negative opinions regarding immigrants settled in Canada. Among residents who had a home telephone at the time, were not busy during the day, and had free time to complete this survey, most believed that only individuals who migrate legally should be allowed to remain. Two-thirds of Canadians want any illegal resident of Canada to be deported. In 2007, in Quebec that statistic reached a level of 70%, whereby individuals stated that \\"reasonable accommodations\\" should be made for illegal immigrants rather than simply deporting them. In 2018, an Angus Reid Institute poll, found that two-thirds (67%) of those polled think that the situation constitutes a \\"crisis\\" and that Canada's \\"ability to handle the situation is at a limit.\\" Fifty-six per cent of respondents who voted Liberal in the 2015 election and 55% of NDP supporters agreed that the matter had reached a crisis level, while 87% of respondents who voted for the Conservatives in the last election called it a crisis. Six-in-ten respondents also told the firm that Canada is \\"too generous\\" toward would-be refugees, a spike of five percentage points since the question was asked last year.https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2018/08/03/canada-border-crossings- poll_a_23494958/https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/angus-reid-border- poll-1.4771961 ==References== Category:Immigration to Canada Canada Category:Canadian law ","title":"Illegal immigration to Canada"},{"id":"35295311","text":"Portland Vase, British Museum, restored by Nigel Williams Fragments of Portland Vase, 1845 watercolor by Thomas H. Shepherd Roman Brown Glass during and after conservation - restoration Conservation and restoration of objects made of glass is one aspect of conservation and restoration of cultural heritage. The nature and varying composition of the material, and the variety of types of object made from it, demand certain specialized techniques. The conservator needs to be aware of \\"agents of deterioration\\" presenting particular risk to glass objects, and how to prevent or counteract their effects. Relevant education and training is available in certain countries through museums, conservation institutes and universities. ==The practice of conservation-restoration== Conservation-restoration is the practice of cleaning and discovering the original state of an object, investigating the proper treatments and applying those treatments to restore the object to its original state without permanently altering the object, and then preserving the object to prevent further deterioration for generations to come (Caple, p. 5-6).Caple, Chris. 2010. 'Conservation: concept and reality. ', in The Conservation of archaeological materials: current trends and future directions. Oxford: Archaeopress, pp. 1-10. BAR International Series. (2116). It can involve many different people from various backgrounds to properly assess and treat an object, such as museum curators, conservators, scientists, and historians. The Metropolitan Museum of Art concludes that “conservators and scientists examine objects in the Museum's collections and those being considered for acquisition to determine their methods of manufacture and chemical compositions, as well as any damage or deterioration they may have undergone… conservators may then perform treatments, such as cleaning, repair, and restoration. They also recommend appropriate conditions for the storage, exhibition, and transportation of objects” (Pilosi and Wypyski, p. 66).Pilosi, Lisa and Wypyski, Mark T. “Technical Examination and Conservation of Glass”. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. p. 66-68. Conservator-restorers can be found in museums, private for hire institutions, conservation associations, and government or state organizations. They not only treat glass objects, but also art, metal, ceramics, wood, and various other materials that are in need of preservation. ==Historic methods of glass cleaning== Glass has been around since the Egyptian XVIII Dynasty, as the very earliest specimen is a glass bead that has been dated to that time during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut.Eisen, Gustavus. “The Origin of Glass Blowing”. American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 20, No. 2 (Apr. - Jun., 1916), pp. 134-143. Glass is very versatile, and there many different types of glass that serve various purposes, such as stained-glass windows, table glassware, and even glass photographic plates. This means that the treatment of these objects depends upon their uses and original purposes. Glass throughout the ages mostly consisted of glass drinking or eating vessels, and then evolved to be part of churches and housing in the form of window glass. According to the Victoria and Albert Museum, most glass is composed of silica (sand), alkali (usually soda or potash), an alkaline earth (lime) and a little waste glass. Other materials, such as lead and barium, could also be added to create a specialized effect in the finished product.“Caring for your Glass”. Victoria and Albert Museum. Methods of cleaning have evolved from washing with water, to using special chemical cleansers especially made for glass, to even dismantling a large glass object, like a window, to be assessed and cleaned under a microscope in a lab. There was not a need to clean glass thoroughly until glass evolved as part of the 20th-century home, and it suddenly became important to keep glass windows clean and the common cleanser Windex came into the picture in the 1930s.Smith, Ernie (July 17, 2017). “A Brief History of Window Cleaning”. For glass objects that are not window glass, the most common way of cleaning is by water if the glass object is intact and not super fragile. The Victoria and Albert Museum provides guidance about how to go about this way of cleaning. The methods of cleaning may differ if the glass is already damaged, extremely thin or fragile, or very old. ==Agents of deterioration== One of the ways in which preventive-conservators address the care of material collections is through assessing risk and needs based on the chief agents of deterioration.\\"Agents of deterioration\\". Canadian Conservation Institute. September 26, 2017. Best practices employ the system of “avoiding, blocking, detecting, and responding” to any address threats. By considering these key factors as potential problems with their own needs, stakeholders can make strides in safeguarding assets such as glass objects. Physical forces to be considered in the preventive-conservation of glass objects can include: “impact, shock, vibration, pressure, abrasion”, and may relate to the need to secure both the objects themselves as well as the environment in which they reside. Fire is a means of deterioration that can impact glass objects ranging from a potentially minimal amount of damage to a total loss. Problems with fire include burning, soot deposits, and melting, warping, discoloration, embrittlement, cracking, and even shattering. Possible interventions to these consequences include creating and maintaining plans and that cover the installation of fire protection equipment and establishing procedures for emergency situations. Pests, such as microorganisms, insects, rodents, birds, and bats, are agents of deterioration not as often associated with the problems that occur with glass objects. However, they can affect glass objects by proxy of other agents, like physical force, such as a bird that might fly into a stained-glass window, pollutants when a rodent that leaves a byproduct. Light, ultraviolet and infrared radiation impact glass in unique ways. While visible light can cause colorful glass to fade, ultraviolet radiation is identified as a non-problematic entity. Infrared radiation does not have a direct effect but can be a cause of heating and therefore subject the glass to problems related to incorrect temperature (see below). The best way of protecting glass from radiation is to eliminate the source as best as possible. It is not always practical to keep a piece of glass out of sight, but strategic scheduling of exposure can reduce impact. Incorrect temperature of glass objects can lead to possible fracture. Stabilization of temperature can help significantly in keeping them from destruction. Incorrect relative humidity in glass objects can lead to crizzling or weeping of glass. Crizzling can occur when relative humidity is below 40%, and lead to cracks in its surface. Glass weeping or sweating can occur when relative humidity is above 55% and loses luster. Thieves and vandals are a potential problem for any object. Since glass objects are generally fragile their susceptibility to vandalism might be preempted by a collections care plan that calls for them to be secured to a stable fixture. Here, the strategy is to “protect, detect, response, and recover” any possible losses. Water itself is not a hazard to stable glass, but in the case of a piece with existing “glass disease,” it can accelerate problems associated with it such as weeping, and crizzling as mentioned above. Here, glass should not be kept in places where the threat of water exposure could occur, such as low to the ground, or near places where water might pool. Pollutants that are airborne or atmospheric pose less of a threat to glass. However, intrinsic pollutants might cause deterioration or degradation. Dissociation is a threat for glass objects just as it might be for any other piece. Since glass objects can be small as well as large, they can be at a greater risk for being mishandled than something more obtrusive. Dissociation can cause problems that range from misplacement, to damage, to total loss. Good records keeping is always a best practice but proves to be one of the best strategies for addressing the threat of dissociation. == Preventive conservation  Education and training ==  The United States  In the United States, the Corning Museum of Glass in New York is the preeminent institute for glass research through the conservation department and library. The conservation department advises on the best practices of displaying, mounting, lighting, storing, and handling glass objects. Additionally, the museum regularly holds courses on the principles and practice of historical and archaeological glass cleaning, care, conservation and restoration for conservators.  The United Kingdom  The Institute of Conservation in the United Kingdom works to conserve cultural heritage in the country with a group that specializes specifically in the care of ceramics and glass. Events hosted through the Institute include conferences and study days. The University of York in England offers a Master's level program in Stained Glass Conservation within the Department of History and Art and in partnership with the Department of Archeology.  Portugal  The VICARTE – Vidro e Cerâmica para as Artes (Glass and Ceramic for the Arts) is a research unit composed of the Faculty of Sciences and Technology of the Universidade Nova de Lisboa and the Faculty of Fine Arts of the Universidade de Lisboa which works to further the research of glass and ceramics. In partnership with cultural heritage institutions across the country, they offer a Master's program in Glass and Ceramic Art and Science with an interdisciplinary approach to the coursework.  France  In France, the only academy where conservators and curators can receive training is at the Institut national du patrimoine (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). For those looking to get involved in the field, a five-year training program for aspiring conservators is offered which grants students with a Master's in Conservation-Restoration, with specialties in earthenware and glassware. ==See also== * Conservation and restoration of metals * Conservation and restoration of copper-based objects * Conservation and restoration of ferrous objects * Conservation and restoration of ivory objects * Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects * Conservation and restoration of silver objects ==References * Care and conservation of ceramic and glass by The Institute of Conservation * Ceramic and glass conservation at National Museums Liverpool Category:Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage Category:Glass Category:Glass art Category:Glass chemistry ","title":"Conservation and restoration of glass objects"},{"id":"35295343","text":"{ HMS Pelican } HMS Pelican was an Osprey-class sloop built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1870s.

This gave Pelican a top speed of . She had a maximum range of at . In addition to the steam-driven propeller, the vessel was also barque rigged. The standard ship's company was between 140 and 150. Armament consisted of two 7-inch (90cwt) muzzle-loading rifled guns, four 64-pound guns, four machine guns, and one light gun. Pelican and her sister-ship were re-armed later with two 6-inch (81cwt) BL guns and six 5-inch (35cwt) BL guns. Pelican was built by Devonport Royal Dockyard. The vessel was laid down on 8 March 1875. She was launched on 26 April 1877, and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 29 November 1877. Construction costs included £41,282 for the hull, and £14,939 for machinery and equipment. ==Fate== Pelican was sold as a supply ship on 22 January 1901 to the Hudson's Bay Company for use as a northern supply ship. During World War I, Pelican was delivering supplies to Russia when she was engaged by a surfaced U-boat. The fight lasted one-and-a-half hours, but eventually, the U-boat was driven off. In 1922, the ship was no longer considered serviceable and was sold as scrap to Fraim Bannikhin of St. John's for $1,500. However, the vessel was not scrapped, instead being reduced to a barge. In November 1922, the barge parted its hawser off Flat Point, while being towed to Sydney, Nova Scotia. The barge grounded near Sable Island. Pelican was recovered by the tugboat Ocean Eagle II and towed her towards Sydney. However, once in the harbour, the barge grounded again on the South Bar. The barge was recovered again and docked at Sydney. In 1927, the barge sank to the bottom of the harbour after being vandalized and her sea cocks opened. The hulk remained with masts, port gunwales and forecastle above water at the wharf for 23 years. The hulk was towed out to sea, escorted by and scuttled in June 1953. ==ReferencesBibliography== * * * Category:Osprey-class sloops Category:Ships built in Plymouth, Devon Category:1877 ships Category:Victorian-era sloops of the United Kingdom Category:Hudson's Bay Company ships Category:Hudson's Bay Company naval ships ","title":"HMS Pelican (1877)"},{"id":"35295344","text":"Ken Scrubbs is a pastor and educational activist who has founded social services programs in Florida for underprivileged youth and federal prisoners.

It was a sequel to the 1952 film Heidi, which was itself an adaptation of the 1880 novel Heidi by Johanna Spyri. It was the first Swiss film made in colour and was one of the biggest grossing films in Switzerland for the year. ==Plot== Two years have passed since Heidi and Klara parted. Klara's plans to visit Heidi never work out. Klara has since suffered a relapse and sometimes has to sit in the chair again. Heidi is doing well at school but Peter prefers to spend his time sledging. Alpöhi comes up with a plan. On December 6, dressed up as Nikolaus, he frightens Peter so much that the boy resolves to do better in school. His reading still isn't that good but then Heidi helps him and achieves what the teachers couldn't and soon Peter learns to read fluently. Klara can finally travel to Switzerland. Peter loses the letter in which she announces her arrival and Heide only finds out at the last minute that Klara is coming. Now Heidi has to take care of her guest. Since Klara can not walk so well, Heidi can not accompany Peter up the mountain anymore. Peter is annoyed especially as he built a shelter specifically for Heidi. In the Alps, Peter meets surveyors surveying the mountains. After speaking with them, Peter wants to take up this profession because he can then stay in the mountains. The training costs a lot of money, which Peter's mother does not have. Peter is becoming more and more taciturn with Heidi and Klara. When he sees the parked up wheelchair, he pushes it down the mountain where it shatters, hoping Klara, who depends on the chair, will leave. Peter begins to have nightmares about his bad action. The Alpöhi soon realises who pushed the wheelchair but says nothing because the absence of the chair encourages Klara to try and walk again. During a stormy night, Klara is frightened. Alpöhi has to go to the village because it is threatened by floods. Klara panics and follows him before Heidi can prevent it. Heidi and her grandfather find Klara near the bridge. The village is flooded but fortunately, there are no casualties though a lot of material damage. Klara, who seems to have been changed by the shock of her adventure, helps with cleaning. When her father arrives, he is astounded to see his daughter in such good spirits and health. To avoid flooding from happening again in the future, it is decided that the stream will be diverted. To raise the necessary funds, a public festival is held. Heidi and Peter, accompanied by Klara on the piano sing in the nearby Spa town to raise funds. Before he and Klara leave, Mr. Sesemann tells Peter he will fund his studies to become a surveyor. ==Cast== * Heinrich Gretler - Alp-Öhi * Elsbeth Sigmund - Heidi * Thomas Klameth - Geissenpeter * Emil Hegetschweiler - Lehrer / Teacher * Willy Birgel - Herr Sesemann / Mr. Sesemann * Traute Carlsen - Klaras Grossmutter / Klara's grandmother * Anita Mey - Frl.

Ernie Els won his second Claret Jug, one stroke ahead of runner-up Adam Scott. Tiger Woods and Brandt Snedeker finished tied for third, four strokes behind Els, who gained his fourth major title. Scott was the leader after 54 holes at 199 (−11), with Els six strokes back, tied for fifth. After a birdie at the 14th hole, Scott was four strokes ahead with four holes to play. Els, two groups ahead of Scott on the course, birdied the 18th hole for a score of 68 and the clubhouse lead at 273 (−7). When Scott agonizingly bogeyed each of the final four holes, he dropped to second and Els won the Championship by a single stroke. Entering the final round, Graeme McDowell and Snedeker were tied for second at 203 (−7), four strokes behind Scott. McDowell shot a 75 (+5) and Snedeker a 74 to knock them out of contention; Woods had a triple bogey at the sixth hole and carded a 73 to tie for third with Snedeker. ==Venue== The 2012 event was the eleventh Open Championship to be played at Royal Lytham & St Annes. The previous one was in 2001, when David Duval won his only major championship, three strokes clear of runner-up Niclas Fasth. Tom Lehman won the previous Open at the venue, in 1996.

Brandt Snedeker fired a bogey-free round of 64 to vault to the top of the leaderboard, one shot ahead of Adam Scott, who shot 67. Tiger Woods, for the second straight round, only missed one fairway in regulation and shot another 3-under 67, including a holed green-side bunker shot for birdie on the 18th hole, to enter the weekend trailing the lead by four shots. Tom Watson, at 62 years of age, set a new record as the oldest player to make the cut in the history of the Open Championship, beating his own record set in 2011.

Adam Scott, who entered the round one stroke behind Snedeker, shot a 68 (two under par) to move to eleven strokes under par, retaking the lead from Snedeker. Tiger Woods shot an even par of 70 to stay at six strokes under par, moving him to fourth place behind Scott, McDowell, and Snedeker.

Graeme McDowell, Brandt Snedeker, and Tiger Woods entered the round within striking distance of Scott, but each faltered and sank out of contention. McDowell shot a 75 (five-over-par), and fell to a tie for fifth with Luke Donald. Snedeker double-bogeyed the seventh and eighth holes, leading to a final round score of 74 (4-over-par), in a tie for third with Woods. Woods had trouble with a greenside bunker on the sixth hole, and triple-bogeyed the hole which he had birdied in each of the three previous rounds. Woods scored a 73 to put him into a tie for third with Snedeker. Despite two bogeys on the front nine, Ernie Els got back to even par for the round with a birdie at the 12th hole and then birdied the 14th. Scott also birdied the 14th but bogeyed the next three to leave him at 7-under, tied with Els, who had birdied the final hole. On the tournament's 72nd hole, Scott put his tee shot into a bunker and had to exit sideways to the fairway. His third shot left him an par-saving putt to force a playoff, but it missed to the left.

Photograph of Mojabi Qazvini family taken in 1955. Haj Seyed Gholamhossein Majd Mojabi (above), pictured with Ahmad Shah Qajar, Shah (King) of Iran (center) and guards in 1901. The Mojabi Shirazi or Mojabi family (, ) is a prominent Iranian family of cultural significance from Qazvin, Iran. Between 1908 and 1997, the family was associated with around 40 publications (comprising newspapers, magazines and pamphlets) in Iran. == Family overview == As religious scholars, members of the Mojabi family held various minbars in Qazvin throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The family also had considerable involvement in political and societal affairs in Qazvin and across Iran. During the late Qajar and Pahlavi eras, the Mojabi family pioneered the publishing houses and periodicals of Qazvin, a city famed for its political newspapers. Of these, Ra’d-i-Qazvin founded and edited by Ali Ra’d Mojabi, was the most long-standing of these periodicals, in print from 1933 to 1950 and was closed down on various occasions by Soviet forces during the occupation of northern Iran in the Second World War.Haddad Adel, Gholamali; Elmi, Mohammad Jafar and Taromi-Rad, Hassan eds. Periodicals of the Muslim World: An Entry from Encyclopaedia of the World of Islam. EWI Press, 2012, p. 84. During this period Ra'd was one of the most renowned periodicals throughout Iran. Another newspaper, Salah-i-Bashar, founded and edited by Naguib Mojabi, ran from 1924 to 1934. Hojatoleslam Naguib ran the weekly journal with the assistance of Mirza Abutorab Sheikholeslami and Mirza Hossein Khayal. The most significant of the periodicals during the Pahlavi I (Rezā Shāh) era was the Bazpurs, which was in print for 12 years (1924-1936), owned and edited by Jafar Adib Mojabi. The focus of the Bazpurs was on societal issues. Other newspapers run by the Mojabi family included Nakhl-e Omid, Sarnevesht and Saadat Qazvin. ==Origin== The family name derives from Ibrahim al-Mujab, more commonly known as Mojab. He was the son of Mohammad al-Abid and grandson of Musa al-Kadhim. Those related to Mojab are therefore known by the surname Mojabi or descendants of Mojab. Mojab is buried in Imam Husayn Shrine, Karbala. Members of the family are directly descended from the 7th Shia Imam Musa Al-Kadhim who is the son of Ja'far al-Sadiq son of Muhammad Al-Baqir son of Ali Zayn al-Abidin son of Husayn ibn Ali son of Ali Bin Abi Talib and the son of Fatimah the daughter of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.

It is based on the 1880 novel Heidi by Johanna Spyri. It was followed by a 1955 sequel Heidi and Peter. ==Plot== Heidi lives with her grandfather, Alp-Öhi, in a cottage in the Swiss Alps and enjoys spending time in the mountains with her friend, the goatherd Peter. The village parson visits the Alp-Öhi. He asks him to come to the village along with Heidi, to attend the installation of the new church bells. Around the installation of the bells, the village festival is held and traditionally it is the children who help hoist up the bells, and Heidi should not be absent. In addition, she could make friends with him and with the children of the village, because soon she should start going to school in the village anyway. The Alp-Öhi is not very happy because he is at odds with the villagers. They accuse him of being responsible for a fire which damaged five houses and the church tower. But the fact is that the Alp-Öhi did not cause the fire and even lost his only son – Heidi's father – fighting the fire. Shortly thereafter, Heidi's mother died from grief over the loss. Aunt Dete, the sister of Heidi's mother, initially cared for the child, but left her with the Alp-Öhi when she got a job in Frankfurt in Germany. Dete is employed at the Sesemann house as a cook. Mr. Sesemann, a wealthy businessman and a widower, is seeking a companion for his daughter Klara who is confined to a wheelchair after an illness. Dete suggests Heidi, travels to the village and tricks Heidi into accompanying her back to Frankfurt. Heidi quickly makes friends with Klara and helps her in every way she can. However, Heidi's natural and spirited manner continually exasperates prissy Miss Rottenmeyer, Klara's governess. All the other staff grow very fond of Heidi, especially Sebastian the butler. All the while Heidi hopes to eventually be allowed to return home to her beloved mountains and grandfather. Eventually a minor miracle occurs: Klara, lovingly cared for by Heidi, begins to walk again. When Mr. Sesemann returns from a long trip, he is overjoyed when he sees his child making a few steps towards him. Out of gratitude for Heidi's accomplishing this miracle, he decrees that she shall stay indefinitely, but this secretly throws her into despair because of her homesickness. Soon afterward the household is disturbed by what seem to be nightly appearances of a ghost. These are revealed by Mr. Sesemann and Doctor Classen, the family doctor and a good friend, to actually being Heidi sleep-walking around the house. Recognizing this as a symptom of deep emotional distress, sympathetic Dr. Classen advises Mr. Sesemann to let Heidi return home immediately, back to her grandfather and the mountains. And so it happens, and it is furthermore decided that Klara shall visit Heidi soon during the holidays. Heidi's return finally resolves the conflict between Alp-Öhi and the villagers, and on Sunday Heidi and her grandfather join the villagers for church service. ==Critical reception== It is still considered the best film version of the novel. ==Cast== * Elsbeth Sigmund: Heidi * Heinrich Gretler: Alp-Öhi * Thomas Klameth: Geissenpeter * Elsie Attenhofer: Tante Dete * Margrit Rainer: Peters Mutter * Fred Tanner: Pfarrer * Isa Günther: Klara Sesemann * Willy Birgel: Herr Sesemann * Traute Carlsen: Klaras Grossmutter * Anita Mey: Frl.

As the New Orleans collective gears up to release their eclectic Power = Power mixtape on December 3 as a free download, the eight- member band has dropped a few aural treats along the way...Somewhere between Cypress Hill, Brand Nubian and Miles Davis, The Soul Rebels are filling the gaps.

It aired daily on NBC from July 1, 1974 to January 3, 1975 and was produced at the NBC Studios in New York's Rockefeller Plaza. ==Gameplay== A typical main-game board from the original format. Two contestants, one a returning champion, raced to spell a word that fit into a given category. The contestants faced a game board of 16 letters with the category into which the word must fit displayed above. The first contestant chose a letter and a question in which the answer began with that letter was posed to both contestants. The first contestant to buzz in got a chance to answer. A correct answer won the contestant that letter, but an incorrect answer automatically gave the opposing contestant the letter. The contestant who won the chosen letter could either place the letter in any one of the seven positions on a display in front of them or discard it. After making their decision, the contestant in control chose another letter. Play continued in this fashion until a contestant spelled a word that fit into the given category. That contestant won the round and moved on to the bonus board. Money Board The winning contestant faced a board of 18 squares, numbered 1–18 around the edges of the board. The first six squares on the top row hid money amounts from $100–$200 while the rest, down both sides and on the bottom, hid letters. The winning contestant selected one of the six money squares which became the starting dollar amount. The player then selected one of the twelve remaining letter squares and had five seconds to give a word that contained that chosen letter. If the given word was acceptable, the contestant won the starting amount and had a chance to either double it by selecting another hidden letter and giving another acceptable word with all uncovered letters, or stop and take his/her earnings to that point. This continued until the contestant elected to quit with his or her winnings, gave an unacceptable word, or failed to come up with a word within the five-second time limit. Part Two When the Money Board round ended, another match was played with two new contestants in the manner described above, while the winner of the first game watched the action from a podium on the side of the stage. The gameplay was identical to the first round, as was the bonus game. If either of the winners of either match lost his/her money on the bonus board, the other contestant became the champion. If both winners stopped with money, they faced off against each other in a Final Showdown round. Final Showdown The top winner had the option of playing first or deferring to his/her opponent. Both contestants took alternating turns playing the Money Board round described above. They kept playing until one contestant failed, at which point the other contestant became the day's champion and won the combined total of the money won by both contestants from their bonus board rounds. Changes Near the end of the run, this round was retitled the \\"Sudden-Death Showdown\\" and was played similarly to the original Money Board round. The contestant in control chose a value at random, as in the Money Board round, but the money was added to the pot for each word given instead of the pot doubling as it had before. Play continued until a contestant failed to give a word that contained all the letters on the board, which awarded the game and pot to the opponent. ==Broadcast history== Winning Streak replaced Stewart and Cullen's Three on a Match, swapping time slots with Jeopardy!. NBC placed Winning Streak at 10:30 AM (9:30 Central) against CBS' strong Gambit. However, Winning Streak made no impact against its competition and ended after six months along with Jeopardy!. Wheel of Fortune replaced Winning Streak on NBC's schedule on January 6, 1975, which would become one of the longest running game shows on television. Episode status The entire series is believed to have been wiped, as per network practices of that era. In the 1990s, Game Show Network aired a single episode of Winning Streak on two occasions: as a standalone broadcast, and in mid-1998 as a subject of original series Faux Pause.Winning Streak on Faux Pause The latter appearance notably included a freeze-frame shot of the production slate, which lists the air date of August 9, 1974 - a day where Streak was preempted due to NBC's coverage of the departure from office of President Richard Nixon and the inauguration of Gerald Ford as his successor, explaining why this particular episode is the only surviving full episode. The first three and a half minutes of the December 26, 1974 episode also exist. The video used to be available on YouTube, but is currently blocked for copyright reasons. ==Theme music== The show's theme song was \\"Saturday About Town\\" by Barry Stoller, from the 1971 De Wolfe Music library album Atomic Butterfly by Meatball (De Wolfe). ==External links== * * Curt Alliaume's Game Shows '75 - \\"Winning Streak\\" ==References== Category:1974 American television series debuts Category:1975 American television series endings Category:1970s American game shows Category:English- language television shows Category:NBC original programming Category:Television series by Bob Stewart Productions Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television ","title":"Winning Streak (American game show)"},{"id":"35295827","text":"Mi Despedida World Tour is an upcoming concert tour by Mexican singer Vicente Fernandez.

He began his archaeological career in 1919, pioneering the search on the indigenous population of Trinidad. By the early 1930s, he already provides evidence of the prominence of reflections on the indigenous history of Trinidad, and on the figure of the Carib, in some of the élites’ writings of local history. Famously in a public lecture in 1938, John Bullbrook, by then a local specialist in the Amerindian history of Trinidad, made the comment: \\"To this day we speak of the Queen if the Caribs at Arima, yet I doubt if there is much --if any--Carib blood in her race.\\". In 1940, for a public lecture and book published under the Royal Victoria Museum and the Historical Society of Trinidad and Tobago, entitled The Ierian Race, Bullbrook wrote: \\"Probably, if I were to ask any of my audience this evening what was the predominant or even the only race in Trinidad at the time of the discovery by Cristobal Colon, the reply would be unhesitatingly: ‘Why, Carib, of course’\\". Throughout the 1940s, he conducted extensive excavations in the Amerindian middens in Cedros, Erin and Palo Seco. The Cedros site in Trinidad, which he excavated with Irving Rouse in 1946, is considered one of the most important archaeological sites in the Caribbean, consisting of a partly destroyed shell midden located on the southwest tip of Trinidad. The corrected radiocarbon datings for the finds at this site were given as 190 B.C. and A.D. 100. Bullbrook, as a partisan in the local debate over whether the true natives of Trinidad were Carib or Arawak, lamented later, in 1960, that the \\"tradition\\" of believing that Caribs were the indigenous people of Trinidad was \\"deep rooted and hard to destroy\\". In July 1960, Bullbrook, at the first conference in the West Indies on pre- Columbian archaeology held in Fort-de-France, Martinique, discussed his research into the \\"Arawaks and Caribs of Trinidad\\" along with the likes of Rev. Father Pinchon and A. H. Anderson. Articles of Bullbrook's have been published in magazines with a varying range of readers such as The Caribbean, Caribbean Quarterly, and Shell Magazine. He later became curator of the Royal Victoria Institute (now the National Museum), and died at the age of 85 (in 1967). John Bullbrook (who was the first to use modern stratigraphic techniques in Trinidad), having been educated in Great Britain, had previous field experience in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. His techniques represent a significant advance over the ‘museological’ approach that characterized the work of Fewkes (1850–1930) and de Booy (1882–1919). His collection of correspondence with Yale University (1941–1963), with a variety of people on the subject of archaeology in the West Indies (1917–1960), with the Historical Society of Trinidad and Tobago (1939–1949); and correspondence with the Trinidad and Tobago Field Naturalists Club, have all been donated to the University of the West Indies by Carlisle Chang (in October 2000). Bullbrook was homosexual, but was married to the lesbian painter Amy Leong Pang. == Selected bibliography == *Notes Concerning Excavation Of Shell Mounds Or Kitchen Middens. Occasional Papers No. 3.

August 10, 1942) was a Polish lawyer and the Professor of Law at the Lviv University (then John Casimir University). His authored more than 1,000 works including publications in the field of procedural law as well as civil and commercial ethnography. He was murdered in Belzec during the Holocaust. ==Biography== Allerhand was born into a Jewish landowner's family in Rzeszów. He graduated from high school in Rzeszów, and later studied at the University of Vienna. He obtained his Ph.D. there in 1892. After his return to Galicia under Austrian rule, Allerhand settled in Lviv and began a law practice. In 1900 he opened an independent law firm, but also, kept publishing his treatise, legal articles and monographs in national and international journals. In 1909 he habilitated at the University of Lwów in the field of procedural law, with the work entitled \\"Deception in courts\\". He also wrote works in the German language, but mainly published in Polish. Since 1910 a lecturer at the University of Lwów, Allerhand was appointed an associate professor in 1917, and in 1922 (in the Polish Second Republic) as the regular Professor. In sovereign Poland On August 22, 1919 Allerhand was selected as member of the Polish Sejm Codification Commission; and in 1922, member of the Tribunal of State. In 1929 he became president of the Jewish Community in Lwów. Without engaging himself politically, he believed in cultural assimilation of Polish Jews. He ran a successful law practice. He also worked scientifically; lectured on law enforcement and market competition law, the history and organization of the Polish judiciary as well as legal profession and notarial services, not to mention the aviation insurance law. By 1933 he was head of the Department of Commercial Law and Bills of Exchange. He often invited young lawyers to seminars in his office. Some of the participants later became prominent Poland's lawyers including Karol Koranyi, Kazimierz Przybyłowski, and Ludwik Dworzak. The seminars of prof. Allerhand were attended also by lawyers Jerzy Sawicki i Stefan Rozmaryn-Kwieciński. In 1932–1933, he announced a two-part commentary on the Code of Civil Procedure; and in 1935, Commentary to the Commercial Code. In 1937 he wrote a review of insolvency law. ==World War II== After the occupation of Lwów by the Soviet army in 1939 and the reorganization of the University by the NKVD, Allerhand was fired, but after several months allowed to teach at the Law Faculty again. Some time later, after the outbreak of the German–Soviet war of June 30, 1941 and the takeover of Lwów by the Wehrmacht, he refused the position of chairman of the Judenrat (Jewish council). He was forced to move into the Lvov Ghetto along with his family, and therefore escaped the July Massacre of Lviv professors committed by an Einsatzkommando. In August, his son Joachim and daughter-in-law Zina (Zinajda) along with their only child Leszek made a successful escape into the aryan side of the city. On 10 August 1941, Allerhand and his wife Salome (Salomea née Weintraub) were transported from the Ghetto to Janowska concentration camp on the outskirts of Lwów. New Jewish Cemetery, Kraków Their deaths are not documented, but after the war, Karol Koranyi made a reference to an eyewitness who survived the Camp and saw them being murdered in the same month by the Ukrainische Hilfspolizei. Their bodies were burned and the ashes scattered. Notably, Allerhand family sometimes appears in print incorrectly as victims of Belzec extermination camp. However, his son Joachim with wife Zina and his grandson Leszek who was 10 at the time, had survived the Holocaust. Decades later and only after the collapse of the Soviet empire - known for falsifying the wartime history of the city - his grandson Leszek published a 2003 book based on the memoirs of his grandfather written in 1941–1942, started by Allerhand soon after the German attack of Lwów and concluded in February 1942. His account of life in the Ghetto, although not nearly as voluminous as Dobroszycki's Chronicle of the Łódź Ghetto provides invaluable insight into the lives of Polish Jews under the Nazi occupation of Lwów. It describes the 1941 pogroms perpetrated by Germans with the aide of local Ukrainians, but also, it includes a mention of his conversation with a former agitator installed at UoL by the Soviets, blaming the Poles for it. He was promptly corrected by Allerhand. The book, entitled Zapiski z tamtego świata (Notes from the Other World; or, A Memoir of Other World), is supplemented with the recollections of the young Leszek Allerhand who lived with his grandparents for a long time before their untimely deaths. The original manuscript survived in the Archives of the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw (Teka Lwowska), unknown to anybody before the 1962 death of prof. Stefan Stasiak from UoL who kept it safe among his own papers. The cenotaph of Maurycy Allerhand and his wife, Salome, can be found at the New Jewish Cemetery in Kraków. In 2009, he became patron of the Allerhand Institute law foundation based in Kraków. ==Notes and references== * A. Redzik Zapiski z tamtego świata.

He has been active in Tuareg rebellions against the Malian government since the 1980s – particularly in the early 1990s. In 1988, founded the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Azawad. In the latest episode of the Tuareg upheavals in 2012, he featured as the founder and leader of the Islamist militant group Ansar Dine. Born in 1954 into a noble family of the Ifogha tribal group (an influential Tuareg clan in the Kidal region), his gift for strategic thinking allegedly earned him the nickname, the Strategist. Sometime between 2005 and 2008, he was appointed as one of Mali's diplomats to Saudi Arabia. ==Battles and wars== Role in 1990 rebellion On the night of 28 June 1990, Ag Ghaly directed attacks by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MPLA) on Tidermèn and Menaka, Mali that killed eighteen people, including at least four Malian Army soldiers. These evening raids were the beginning of a renewed Tuareg rebellion in Mali. From 1991 until a formal truce with the Malian government in 1996, Ag Ghaly led the rebel group Popular Movement of Azawad, one of four splinter groups created from the MPLA's disintegration after Ag Ghaly signed the Tamanrasset Accords in Algeria on behalf of the Tuareg people fighting for an independent homeland in January 1991. Ag Ghaly was reportedly escorted to Bamako, Mali's southern capital, after signing the accords. As a result of his perceived closeness to the \\"traditional hierarchy\\", according to one analyst, Ag Ghaly was unable to hold together the MPLA after signing the controversial agreement, though ultimately a coup in March 1991 overturned the Accords and fighting went on. By 1995, Radio France Internationale referred to Ag Ghaly as the \\"undisputed leader\\" of the Tuareg rebel movement. After the 1996 ceasefire, Ag Ghaly normalised relations with the Malian government. In 2003, he was instrumental in negotiating the release of 14 German tourist hostages from Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, then called \\"the Algerian Salafi Group for Call and Combat\\". WikiLeaks later released a U.S. State Department cable in which the author described Ag Ghaly as a \\"proverbial bad penny\\" who always turned up when a Western government had to give money to Tuaregs. Ag Ghaly was appointed as a member of Mali's diplomatic staff in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, by President Amadou Toumani Touré in 2008. Once \\"a great fan of cigarettes, booze, and partying\\", interested in music and poetry, with connections to the Tuareg band Tinariwen, he was proselytised to strict Islam by the Tablighi Jamaat missionary movement. In Saudi Arabia he experienced a \\"religious re-birth\\", growing a large beard and meeting with unnamed jihadists. The latter action caused him to be recalled to Bamako. 2012 rebellion In late 2011, Ag Ghaly attempted to assume the leadership of the Tuareg group Kel Adagh, but failed. Unable to take a leadership role with the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), the mainstream Tuareg rebellion, Ag Ghaly announced the formation of the Islamist Ansar Dine, which he claimed controlled much of northeastern Mali, in a video statement. Ag Ghaly also stated that his fighters were responsible for a bloody attack on the commune of Aguelhok two months before. He said the group would continue to fight until sharia law was established throughout Mali. The announcement created friction with the MNLA, a secular group fighting for Azawad's independence from Mali, including former allies of Ag Ghaly who urged him to break his rumoured ties to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. When Ag Ghaly reportedly refused to disavow any association with the al Qaeda offshoot, the MNLA branded him a \\"criminal\\" and issued a statement claiming the \\"theocratic regime\\" envisioned by Ag Ghaly contradicted \\"the foundations of [Tuareg] culture and civilization\\". Although Ag Ghaly's militants appeared to coordinate with the MNLA in the capture of Kidal, the Associated Press reported that the day after it fell to rebel fighters, Ansar Dine militants removed the colorful flags of Azawad planted by their MNLA comrades-in-arms throughout the city. Jeremy Keenan, a professor at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, stated that the military contribution of Ag Ghaly's fighters was slight compared to the much larger MNLA: \\"What seems to happen is that when they move into a town, the MNLA take out the military base — not that there's much resistance — and Iyad goes into town and puts up his flag and starts bossing everyone around about sharia law.\\" According to Keenan, Ag Ghaly is linked to the Algerian intelligence service. On 3 April, Ag Ghaly gave a radio interview in Timbuktu announcing that Sharia law would be enforced in the city, including the veiling of women, the stoning of adulterers, and the punitive mutilation of thieves. According to Timbuktu's mayor, the announcement caused nearly all of Timbuktu's Christian population to flee the city. On 26 February 2013, the U.S. Department of State designated Ag Ghaly as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. On 2 March 2017, Ghaly pledged his oath of allegiance to Ayman al-Zawahiri, and formed the Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal Muslimeen. ==References External links == * Christopher Wise: \\"The Jihad of Iyad Ag Ghali\\" (English Language lecture, Green College, UBC Jan 2019) Category:1954 births Category:Malian Al-Qaeda members Category:Berber Malians Category:Living people Category:Malian Islamists Category:Tuareg people Category:Azawad Category:Individuals designated as terrorists by the United States government Category:People from Kidal Region Category:Leaders of Islamic terror groups Category:Berber Islamists ","title":"Iyad Ag Ghaly"},{"id":"35296160","text":"\\"Superstar\\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Madonna from her twelfth studio album MDNA (2012). It was released on December 3, 2012, in Brazil only as a special edition free CD with Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo. The song was written and produced by Madonna, Hardy \\"Indigo\\" Muanza and Michael Malih and is a dance-pop track, which has electronic and pop influences. Instrumentation featured in \\"Superstar\\" includes guitars and drum machines. Lyrically, Madonna compares her boyfriend with famous men, such as John Travolta, Abraham Lincoln, Al Capone, among others and claims to be his \\"biggest fan\\". The accompanying artwork for the single was created by Brazilian graffiti artist Simone Sapienza, who won a contest sponsored by Johnnie Walker's Keep Walking Project in Brazil. She was chosen by Madonna from ten finalists of the contest. \\"Superstar\\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, most of whom felt it would be a potential single and praised the production, while others dismissed the lyrical content. A music video for the track was shot, however it was controversial since Madonna wanted to dress as a \\"Terror Bride\\", a combination of an Iraqi bridal veil and a US soldier's uniform. Subsequently, the video was never released. \\"Superstar\\" was used in a television campaign for US TV channel Bravo, supporting its \\"Summer by Bravo\\" promotion including stars from its original programming. ==Background and composition== alt=A two-storied rectangular building with large windows and door. A number of cars are parked in front of it. \\"Superstar\\" was written and produced by Madonna, Hardy \\"Indigo\\" Muanza and Michael Malih and was recorded at MSR Studios in New York City. After the completion of MDNA, critics around the world were invited to Abbey Road Studios for an initial review of the album. Many critics noted that Madonna's daughter Lourdes' vocals appeared in \\"Superstar\\", which was subsequently confirmed by the singer herself. Musically, \\"Superstar\\" is an uptempo dance- pop song, that features influences of electronic and pop music. The track was mixed by Demacio 'Demo' Castellon for The Demolition Crew, and recorded by Angie Teo. Editing for the track was completed by Stephen 'The Koz' Kozmeniuk for The Demolition Crew. The song makes references to historical figures including Marlon Brando, James Dean, Al Capone, Bruce Lee, Julius Caesar, Abraham Lincoln and John Travolta. Billboards Keith Caulfied noted dubstep influences during the bridge, and like other songs on MDNA, \\"Superstar\\" takes time to change the composition into a fast-paced track. According to Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph, the composition features a \\"shimmering ambiance built up from a ringing guitar loop and echoing tom-tom pattern that might have been constructed from Beatles' drum fills.\\" Along with the looping music, the lyrics are simple and obtuse in nature, which McCormick believed was done deliberately like \\"You can have the password to my phone / I'll give you a massage when you get home\\". There are also references to her older songs like \\"Into the Groove\\" (1985) with the line, \\"You're Travolta getting into your groove\\". ==Artwork and release== The accompanying artwork for \\"Superstar\\" was created by Brazilian graffiti artist Simone Sapienza, known as Siss. It was directed by Binho Ribeiro and Giovanni Bianco. On the cover Madonna wears a shorts with a whip, while a phrase reads; \\"The shorts says: 'let's have dinner!'. The whip says, 'but you must pay for'\\". A contest sponsored by Keep Walking Brazil project selected 30 proposed covers, and Sapienza was chosen by Madonna after being among the ten finalists. The creator said she did not know she was participating in a cover contest and explained, \\"My work is connected to the status of women. I like strong women, who work hard for what they think is right.\\" \\"Superstar\\" was released as a promotional single in Brazil on December 3, 2012. Readers of Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo received a free copy of the single together with their newspaper. The single features the original album version along with a remixed version by DJ Eddie Amador. The song was also used in a television campaign for US TV channel Bravo, supporting its \\"Summer by Bravo\\" promotion including stars from its original programming. ==Critical reception== \\"Superstar\\" received generally mixed to favorable reviews from music critics. Becky Bain from Idolator called it a \\"sweet love song\\" and compared it as the sweeter, more simplified version of \\"Ray of Light\\". Andy Gill from The Independent stated the song was an \\"obvious hit single\\" and compared the song to her 1990 release, \\"Vogue\\". MuuMuse's Bradley Stern complimented \\"the sugary-sweet, instantly summer-friendly\\" nature of the song, while Alexis Petridis from The Guardian described the composition of the track as \\"saccharine\\". Dean Piper from the Daily Mirror felt the song was not one he was \\"immediately keen on – but the one that's in my head. It's lyrically very simple [...] It's a little rockier than the others and more conventional.\\" Priya Elan from NME was very positive towards the song, and described it, along with \\"Girl Gone Wild\\", as \\"accomplishments\\" and \\"sound better than they have any right to.\\" While reviewing the album, Robert Copsey from Digital Spy noted that \\"Superstar\\" was the most \\"relaxed [sounding] song\\" compared to the rest of the tracks which he described as kind of \\"in-yer-face.\\" Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph described the song as \\"sweet and summery\\". Writing for Popjustice, Brad O'Mance rated the song 9 out of 10 and explained in detail: > The lyrical reference points in ['Superstar'] are all quite interesting—if > you consider the youth-obsessed reference collaborators of the first two > singles and how uncomfortable it all feels. 'Superstar' offers a glimpse of > something far more comfortable in its own skin. All the reference points > will mean very little to your average 17-year-old. We suppose the idea is > that they're icons whose imagery transcends generations blah blah blah but > after all the aggressive positioning of the first two singles it's great to > hear Madonna relaxing into this sort of song. The lyrics about being in love > are a bit soppy but love makes you go a bit soppy sometimes. Michael Roffman from Consequence of Sound was more critical towards the lyrical content, describing the song itself as \\"infantile\\" and her lyrics like they were \\"stripped from a fifth grader's notebook at the history fair.\\" Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani gave it a mixed review, calling its lyrical content a \\"faux pas\\". Another mixed reception came from writers of Virgin Media, who awarded it three stars out of five, and called it a \\"passable slice of electro-hued chart-pop.\\" Enio Chiola from PopMatters gave it a poor review for its lyrical content by calling it \\"badly written\\", but stated that songs like \\"'Superstar' and 'Masterpiece' indicates that Madonna isn't just a blubbering mess of bitterness.\\" In his review of MDNA for Pitchfork Media, Matthew Perpetua said that the track, along with \\"B-Day Song\\" from the album, are \\"mesmerizingly dumb lyrics\\" and are as \\"spiteful trolling rather than vapid pandering.\\" Gigwise listed the lyrics as one of the most embarrassing moments on MDNA. In August 2018, Billboard picked it as the singer's 86th greatest single; \\"a blatant copycat of Solveig's smash Dragonette collab 'Hello', it also has one of the sweetest, most straightforward choruses of the whole MDNA set\\". ==Music video== Although no music video was officially confirmed or produced, media outlets reported that a music video for \\"Superstar\\" was to be shot in October 2012. Madonna wanted to dress as a \\"Terror Bride\\", which is a combination of an Iraqi bridal veil and a US soldier's uniform. The dress was to be portrayed as a statement for oppression against women and warfare. However, the singer's advisers talked her out of wearing the costume because they thought it would \\"put her life at risk\\". Sources then stated \\"[Madonna] had the outfit ready to go. She was really proud of it and said it was her 'Terror Bride' costume [...] At first, when people started telling her it was madness, she just brushed it off, but when they mentioned that her actions could put her life at risk, she decided to ditch it from her video and certainly won't be wearing it on stage.\\" Madonna said she was \\"really disappointed\\" about not wearing the outfit, but had put aside the idea for a future use. ==Track listing== *;Keep Walking Brazil Special Edition CD single #\\"Superstar\\" – 3:55 #\\"Superstar\\" (Eddie Amador Remix) – 6:18 ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from the MDNA album liner notes. *Madonna – vocals, songwriter, producer *Hardy \\"Indigo\\" Muanza – songwriter, producer *Michael Malih – songwriter, producer *Demacio 'Demo' Castellon – audio mixing for The Demolition Crew *Angie Teo – recording at MSR Studios, New York City *Stephen 'The Koz' Kozmeniuk – music editing for The Demolition Crew *Lourdes \\"Lola\\" Leon – background vocals ==Charts== After the release of MDNA, \\"Superstar\\" debuted at number 150 on the South Korea International Downloads chart, with a total of 174,917 streams and digital downloads. { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - !scope=\\"col\\"Chart (2012) !scope=\\"col\\"Peak position - !scope=\\"row\\"South Korea International Downloads (GAON)  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"150 } ==Release history== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Country ! scope=\\"col\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" Format ! scope=\\"col\\" Label - ! scope=\\"row\\" Brazil  December 3, 2012  Free CD single with Folha de S.Paulo  rowspan=\\"1\\" Interscope } ==References * Category:2012 songs Category:Madonna (entertainer) songs Category:Songs written by Madonna (entertainer) Category:Song recordings produced by Madonna (entertainer) ","title":"Superstar (Madonna song)"},{"id":"35296167","text":"\\"I Don't Give A\\" is a song by Madonna from her album MDNA I Don't Give A may also refer to: *\\"I Don't Give A\\" (Lisa Ajax song), 2017 * \\"I Don't Give A...\\", a song by Missio from their album Loner * \\"I Don't Give A...\\", a song by Peaches from her album Fatherfucker ==See also== * \\"I Don't Giva\\", a song by Kristinia DeBarge from Thinkin Out Loud * \\"I Don't Give\\", a song by Avril Lavigne from Let Go * \\"I Don't Give a Fuck\\", a song by 2Pac * \\"Just Don't Give a Fuck\\", a song by Eminem ","title":"I Don't Give A (disambiguation)"},{"id":"35296175","text":"Manor Apartment Hotel is a heritage-listed former office building and now apartment hotel at 289 Queen Street, Brisbane City, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Hennessey, Hennessey & Co and built from 1930 to 1931 by Concrete Constructions (QLD) Limited. It is also known as Colonial Mutual Life Building and Newspaper House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. ==History== The building was constructed between 1930 and 1931 for Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society (CML).  First building  The Queensland branch of CML was formed in June 1874. In 1883 the society built offices at 62 Queen Street (Colonial Mutual Chambers). In August 1906 CML purchased this site at 289 Queen Street, adjacent to the General Post Office in the heart of the Brisbane Central Business District, and constructed new premises. The first building was demolished in 1930 to enable the construction of a new commodious building on the site for the expanding society. Between 1925 and 1934 much of the south side of Queen Street was redeveloped, including National Mutual Life Association Building (1926), the Commonwealth Bank (1929) and the Australian Mutual Provident Society building (1931-1934).  Current building  leftTo compensate for the site's narrow frontage of , an agreement was made between the Commonwealth authorities, who administer the adjoining General Post Office, and CML to allow a \\"right-of-way to extend the full depth of the building\\". In October 1930, the yet-to-demolished buildings sustained some damage following a fire; however, the fire was not the reason for the construction of the current building (as some sources suggest) as the plans had already been announced a month earlier. Demolition of the old offices was underway by November 1930, with construction of the current building well underway by February 1931.  Construction  The Benedict stone used for the facing, a mixture of cement and crushed Brisbane tuff was manufactured by Benedict Stone (Qld) Pty Ltd which was established by Archbishop James Duhig to manufacture the stone required for the Holy Name Cathedral, Fortitude Valley. The product was developed at the turn of the twentieth century by American manufacturer, Benedict. Duhig obtained a licence from America and opened the Benedict Stone works at Bowen Hills on 9 August 1929. In February 1930 CML advanced Duhig a mortgage on his properties which included the stone works. A mutually dependent relationship developed between CML, Duhig and Jack Hennessey, architect. CML used Benedict stone to build a number of their Australian offices, ensuring some of their mortgage was repaid and employed Hennessey and Concrete Constructions (Qld) Ltd, Brisbane (Duhig's architect and contractor for the Holy Name Cathedral). As Hennessey, Hennessey & Co., was based in Sydney, construction was supervised by Leo Drinan, the firm's Brisbane Manager. Concrete Construction (Qld) Ltd also built the CML offices in Sydney and Melbourne. George Harvey was responsible for the masonry work on the building and may have created the gargoyles on the façade. The stone was delivered and positioned within seven months, setting an Australian record for stonework. Built during an economic depression, its construction provided employment for many Queensland workers.  Opening  On 12 November 1931 the CML building was officially opened by the Governor, Lieutenant-General Sir John Goodwin. The ground floor provided offices for Colonial Mutual and the arcade leading to Queen Street contained retail premises. The offices and professional suites on the upper floors were available for lease.  Later owners  Queensland Newspapers (a subsidiary of News Corporation and publisher of The Courier-Mail newspaper) purchased the site in September 1983, cleaned and repaired the exterior and re-opened the building as Newspaper House on 11 September 1985. Current use Part of a room in the Manor Apartment Hotel in 2015 In 1994, the building was converted and fully refurbished to become an apartment hotel, The Manor Apartments, comprising 46 studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments each with its own fully equipped kitchen and laundry and separate and fully furnished bedrooms and living areas. The apartments are air-conditioned, but windows may still be opened. The 1930s origins of the building are still evident in the classically spacious and high-ceiling interiors and in the special stonework and sculptures. The building was used as a stand in for a New York City skyscraper in the 1996 film The Phantom. == Description== This inter-war commercial building is ten storeys high with a narrow frontage to Queen Street and a long side elevation. It has been designed in sympathy with adjoining buildings, matching the arcade of the GPO at its base and responding to the parapet line of the National Mutual Life Building in its upper levels. The building has a concrete encased steel frame with concrete floors and is faced in Benedict Stone, the colours of which range from green to pink (a property of Brisbane tuff). The style of the sculptured ornament on the building facades is influenced by American Art Deco buildings of this period, as well as containing some Norman influence. It is similar in style to interstate Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd buildings. Closer view of the Benedict Stone and sculptures, 2012 The building has three paired window bays across the Queen Street facade. Three double height arched openings occur at the ground floor level. On the level above are paired window openings with arched heads and a central ornamented column. The two levels below the top floor have paired window bays which are similar but double the height. At the base of these is an imitation balcony with balusters supported on brackets. In this way the building has both a distinctive top and base. A similar projecting balcony occurs in front of the central window bay on the level below. Above the double height bays at the base of the top level sculptured lions stand on projecting brackets. The one facing the corner is winged. The parapet has raised portions each with a projecting stylised eagle \\"gargoyle\\". Similar gargoyles appear in the same location a level below and also below each projecting flag post above the third floor. The entire Queen Street facade is repeated at each end of the side elevation, the central bays of which are plainer. Behind the parapet the building has an interesting roofscape of steeply pitched terracotta tiled roofs, one above the caretakers quarters and another over the lift room on the eleventh floor. At street level individual awnings have been located between the archways. From the rear laneway the building duplicates much of the front facade but is painted. Internally the original detailing remains in the fire stairs, including the handrail and tiled landings. All the levels have been refurbished with suspended ceilings that sit below the window heads. == Heritage listing == The building was listed on the Register of the National Estate in 1987. However, that register no longer has any statutory significance. The Manor Apartment Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.

Hart's other 1961 film, Francis of Assisi, inspired her to retire from acting two years later and become a Roman Catholic nun. ==Plot== When Gilbert Barrows (Robert Wagner) disobeys his boss and tries to refit an old Liberty Ship for cargo use instead of scrapping it, he inadvertently puts it into the hands of a colorful group of crooks led by good-hearted screw-up Bugsy G. Fogelmeyer (Ernie Kovacs) and brainy sociopath George M. Wilson (Frank Gorshin). The crooks plan to use the ship to make their getaway after they pull a bank robbery in Boston, and they kidnap Barrows and his girlfriend Elinor Harrison (Dolores Hart) - his boss's daughter - to prevent leaving any witnesses behind. With the help of Bugsy's nephew Rodney J. Fogelmeyer (Frankie Avalon), Gilbert and Elinor manage to foil the crooks' plans by using Elinor's bra as a slingshot and attracting the Coast Guard. ==Cast== *Robert Wagner as Gilbert Barrows *Dolores Hart as Elinor Harrison *Carolyn Jones as Virginia *Ernie Kovacs as Bugsy G.

It was written by series creator and executive producer Matthew Weiner and Robin Veith, and directed by Lesli Linka Glatter. It originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on September 20, 2009. The employees of Sterling Cooper prepare for an upcoming visit from the British owners of the company. Joan discovers some deeply unsettling news as she prepares for her last day in the office. During the visit, a tragic (and comedic) accident changes the life and career of one man forever. Meanwhile, Sally is having trouble adjusting to life with Baby Gene and without her grandfather. \\"Guy Walks Into an Advertising Agency\\" is considered by some as one of the best episodes of Mad Men. It was recognized with nominations and wins from industry awards. The director of the episode, Lesli Linka Glatter, won a 2009 Directors Guild Awards for her work on the episode. The episode was also nominated for writing and directing at the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards. The name of this episode mirrors the name of an episode of The Sopranos, \\"Guy Walks into a Psychiatrist's Office...\\", a series on which Mad Men creator, Matthew Weiner, was a writer. ==Plot== The Sterling Cooper employees are dismayed to learn of the imminent arrival of their bosses from London, who will arrive on Joan's final day in the office. That night, Joan's husband Greg arrives after a night of drunken self-loathing. He admits to Joan that he has been rejected for the title of Chief Resident, and that Joan will have to return to work. After Joan asserts that she can't return to Sterling Cooper, Greg demands that she find a new job. The London-based Putnam, Powell, and Lowe executives arrive at the Sterling Cooper office on the day of Joan's surprise party. One of the executives is a young up-and-comer named Guy MacKendrick (Jamie Thomas King), poised to replace Lane Pryce as Sterling Cooper's Chief Operating Manager while Lane is reassigned to Bombay, India. Ken and the other office employees get up to hijinks with a John Deere riding mower after Ken signs their account. Office secretary Lois takes the machine for a spin, but runs it over Guy's foot, severely lacerating it and spraying blood all over the Sterling Cooper employees and the office. As the other employees give way to hysteria, Joan calmly attends to Guy. Don and Joan share kind words at the hospital, as the Putnam, Powell and Lowe executives mourn over the young Guy MacKendrick's career, lamenting that the boy could no longer work clients with a missing foot; as a result Lane retains his position at Sterling Cooper. Don is aghast at how quickly the executives disregard Guy's career. Sally is having trouble adjusting to the presence of Baby Gene, waking up in the middle of the night to night terrors. Don implores Betty to change the name, because of both Sally's discomfort and his poor relationship with Grandpa Gene. Betty refuses to dishonor her father by changing the name. Don then comforts Sally, and tells her that Baby Gene has a clean slate in life, and is not anyone yet. ==Reception== Critical reception The episode received critical acclaim from television journalists and critics. Alan Sepinwall, writing for New Jersey's The Star-Ledger, called it \\"one of the best Mad Men episodes ever\\" and the \\"highlight of Season 3 to date\\". Sepinwall also opined that it was one of the series' funniest episodes yet, while also working as a \\"dramatic marvel\\" and having considerable shock value through the lawn mower accident. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune exalted the hour as \\"jaw-dropping awesomeness\\" and expected Emmy wins for the writers and director, while praising both Christina Hendricks and Jon Hamm's performances. She directed special praise for Lesli Linka Glatter, saying that \\"the way she staged the 'fete' at SC, the injury of Guy, and especially that scene in Kinsey's office was just right. The lawnmower was threaded through the episode perfectly, and once we saw it emerge at the party, we thought typical SC party high jinks were, er, afoot. But suddenly, there's that arc of blood and that spatter across several partygoers. It was truly one of Mad Men's Most. Shocking. Moments.\\" Time Magazine writer James Poniewozik said the episode was a \\"sufficiently stunningly bloody episode to make up for several episodes of smoke exhalations and brooding looks.\\" Poniewozik, however, criticized the \\"dropped-like-a-brick mention of Vietnam in the office conversation. It’s plausible that people were starting to talk about Vietnam in 1963, but there are better ways than by kicking off a dialogue, 'My dad keeps talking about Vietnam'.\\" Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wasn't sure if it was a \\"pivotal episode of Mad Men\\", but that \\"if this episode isn’t bound to be a classic, who cares – Mad Men certainly is.\\" Ratings On its original American broadcast on September 20, 2009, on AMC, the episode was viewed by 1.57 million people. Accolades At the 62nd Directors Guild of America Awards, episode director Lesli Linka Glatter won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Drama Series. The episode was also nominated for the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Drama at the 62nd Writers Guild of America Awards. For the 62nd Primetime Emmy Awards, the episode received two nominations – Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series (Robin Veith and Matthew Weiner) and Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (Lesli Linka Glatter). ==References * \\"Guy Walks Into an Advertising Agency\\" at AMC * * Category:2009 American television episodes Category:Mad Men (season 3) episodes ","title":"Guy Walks Into an Advertising Agency"},{"id":"35296301","text":"Biondo is an Italian surname.

Built in 1754 near Sidcup, Kent, Foots Cray Place was demolished in 1950 after a fire in 1949. Of the three other houses in England, Nuthall Temple in Nottinghamshire was built 1757 and demolished in 1929; the other two survive: Mereworth Castle (completed 1725, also in Kent) and Chiswick House (completed 1729, in London),Chiswick House, one of the most notable of England's Palladian houses was partially demolished in the 20th century; only the \\"corps de logis\\" remains today both now Grade I listed buildings. A modern fifth example, Henbury Hall, was built near Macclesfield in the 1980s.http://www.julianbicknell.co.uk/view-henburyrotunda_cheshire.php, http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/PalladianBritain/VillasInBritain/VillaRotondasInfluence/HenburyHall.aspx Another example of a similar structure in England is the Temple of the Four Winds at Castle Howard, which is a garden building not a house. ==Earlier houses== The Kentish manor of Foots Cray is mentioned in the Domesday Book. Later, it was acquired by the Walsingham family and held for six generations until it was sold around 1676. An Elizabethan E-shaped house - also known as Pike Place - was still on the site in the 1680s. The estate passed through several hands before it was purchased by Bourchier Cleeve in 1752 for £5,450. Cleeve had the old house pulled down and a new one constructed slightly further north in about 1754. ==Palladian mansion== The location of Foots Cray Place The design of the new Palladian mansion has been attributed to the architect Isaac Ware in Vitruvius Britannicus iv (1777, pls. 8-10),Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600-1840, 3rd ed. (Yale University Press), s.v. \\"Isaac Ware\\", under \\"Doubtful and attributed works\\". but it has also been suggested that Matthew Brettingham the Younger or Daniel Garrett could have been the designer. Following the model of the Villa Capra, it had a large square central block surmounted by a wide dome, with a portico on each face, all constructed in stone. Three of the porticos at Foots Cray Place were filled in to create additional internal space. The central hall was octagonal, with a gallery leading to the upper rooms, lit from above. The service buildings were built in brick a short distance from the main house. Cleeve accumulated a large collection of paintings, including examples by Rembrandt, Reubens, Van Dyke, Canaletto and Holbein, which he displayed at Foots Cray Place. The estate was inherited by Cleeve's daughter on his death in 1760; she married Sir George Yonge in 1767, and the house was sold to Benjamin Harenc in 1772 for £14,500. He had it remodelled in 1792 by the minor London architect Henry Hakewill.Henry Hakewill (1771-1830), a pupil of John Yenn, became architect to the trustees of Rugby School; he is buried at North Cray (Colvin 1995 s.v. \\"Henry Hakewill\\"). Harenc's son sold the house in 1821 to Nicholas Vansittart, then Chancellor of the Exchequer and soon to become ennobled as Baron Bexley. Hakewill further remodelled the house in 1823, and more works were carried out for Lord Bexley by another London architect of equally modest reputation, John William Hiort, who also built Bexley's London house in Great George Street, Westminster.John William Hiortt (1772-1861) was an architect attached to the Office of Works, where he was much employed in designing occasional structures for ceremonies; he designed some ancillary structures at Claremont House, Surrey, for Princess Charlotte, and patented bricks for designing circular chimney flues that were used at Buckingham Palace. (Colvin 1995, s.v. \\"John William Hiort\\"). The Vansittart family retained the house and estate until it was sold to Samuel Waring (later Baron Waring) in the late 19th century. In 1939, at the beginning of World War II, the house was requisitioned for use by the Thames Nautical Training College, HMS \\"Worcester\\" whose ship of that name had been requisitioned by the Admiralty. Lord Waring died in 1940, and after the College vacated the property, dilapidated after its wartime use, in 1946, Waring's widow sold the house and grounds to Kent County Council for use as a museum. A fire in October 1949 caused extensive damage, and the house was demolished in 1950.Colvin 1995, s.v. \\"Henry Hakewell\\". ==Foots Cray Meadows== The stable block and walled gardens with pavilion remains standing, but the grounds, known as Foots Cray Meadows, provide a valuable public green space in this south-eastern suburb of London. This 89-hectare park was formed in the early 19th century from two mid-18th-century landscaped parks and is listed by English Heritage as a Grade II historic park,An impression of the surviving landscape can be obtained from the Hidden London website and it is a Local Nature Reserve. The London Outer Orbital Path passes through Foots Cray Meadows on its way from Old Bexley to Sidcup Place and Petts Wood. There is some industry in an area next to the meadows and bordering the river. ==References *Lost Heritage - Foot's Cray Place Category:Houses completed in 1754 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1950 Category:Former country houses in the United Kingdom Category:Country houses in Kent Category:Rotundas in the United Kingdom Category:Palladian architecture in England Category:British country houses destroyed in the 20th century Category:1754 establishments in England ","title":"Foots Cray Place"},{"id":"35296365","text":"Health gap in England and Wales, 2011 Census The social determinants of health in poverty describe the factors that affect impoverished populations' health and health inequality. Inequalities in health stem from the conditions of people's lives, including living conditions, work environment, age, and other social factors, and how these affect people's ability to respond to illness. These conditions are also shaped by political, social, and economic structures. The majority of people around the globe do not meet their potential best health because of a \\"toxic combination of bad policies, economics, and politics\\". Daily living conditions work together with these structural drivers to result in the social determinants of health. Poverty and poor health are inseparably linked. Poverty has many dimensions – material deprivation (of food, shelter, sanitation, and safe drinking water), social exclusion, lack of education, unemployment, and low income – that all work together to reduce opportunities, limit choices, undermine hope, and, as a result, threaten health. Poverty has been linked to higher prevalence of many health conditions, including increased risk of chronic disease, injury, deprived infant development, stress, anxiety, depression, and premature death. According to Loppie and Wien, these health afflictions of poverty most burden outlying groups such as women, children, ethnic minorities, and the disabled. Social determinants of health – like child development, education, living and working conditions, and healthcare\\\\- are of special importance to the impoverished. According to Moss, socioeconomic factors that affect impoverished populations such as education, income inequality, and occupation, represent the strongest and most consistent predictors of health and mortality. The inequalities in the apparent circumstances of individual's lives, like individuals' access to health care, schools, their conditions of work and leisure, households, communities, towns, or cities, affect people's ability to lead a flourishing life and maintain health, according to the World Health Organization. The inequitable distribution of health-harmful living conditions, experiences, and structures, is not by any means natural, \\"but is the result of a toxic combination of poor social policies and programmes, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics\\". Therefore, the conditions of individual's daily life are responsible for the social determinants of health and a major part of health inequities between and within countries. Along with these social conditions, \\"Gender, education, occupation, income, ethnicity, and place of residence are all closely linked to people's access to, experiences of, and benefits from health care.\\" Social determinants of disease can be attributed to broad social forces such as racism, gender inequality, poverty, violence, and war. This is important because health quality, health distribution, and social protection of health in a population affect the development status of a nation. Since health has been considered a fundamental human right, one author suggests the social determinants of health determine the distribution of human dignity. ==Definitions and measurements== Social determinants of health in poverty reveal inequalities in health. Health is defined \\"as feeling sound, well, vigorous, and physically able to do things that most people ordinarily can do\\". Measurements of health take several forms including subjective health reports completed by individuals and surveys that measure physical impairment, vitality and well being, diagnosis of serious chronic disease, and expected life longevity. The World Health Organization defines the social determinants of health as \\"the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age\\" , conditions that are determined by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels. There exist two main determinants of health: structural and proximal determinants. Structural determinants include societal divisions between social, economic, and political contexts, and lead to differences in power, status, and privilege within society. Proximal determinants are immediate factors present in daily life such as family and household relationships, peer and work relationships, and educational environments. Proximal determinants are influenced by the social stratification caused by structural determinants. According to the World Health Organization, social determinants of health include early child development, globalization, health systems, measurement and evidence, urbanization, employment conditions, social exclusion, public health conditions, and women and gender equality. Different exposures and vulnerabilities to disease and injury determined by social, occupational, and physical environments and conditions, result in more or less vulnerability to poor health. The World Health Organization's Social Determinants Council recognized two distinct forms of social determinants for health- social position and socioeconomic and political context. The following divisions are adapted from World Health Organization's Social Determinants Conceptual Framework for explaining and understanding social determinants of health. ==Social position== Poverty gradient and severity Within the impoverished population exists a wide range of real income, from less than US$2 a day, to the United States poverty threshold, which is $22,350 for a family of four. Within impoverished populations, being relatively versus absolutely impoverished can determine health outcomes, in their severity and type of ailment. According to the World Health Organization, the poorest of all, globally, are the least healthy. Those in the lowest economic distribution of health, marginalized and excluded, and countries whose historical exploitation and inequality in global institutions of power and policy-making, suffer the worst health outcomes. As such, two broad categories distinguish between relative severity of poverty. Absolute poverty is the severe deprivation of basic human needs such as food, safe drinking water and shelter, and is used as a minimum standard below which no one should fall regardless of where they live. It is measured in relation to the 'poverty line' or the lowest amount of money needed to sustain human life. Relative poverty is \\"the inability to afford the goods, services, and activities needed to fully participate in a given society.\\" Relative poverty still results in bad health outcomes because of the diminished agency of the impoverished. Certain personal, household factors, such as living conditions, are more or less unstable in the lives of the impoverished and represent the determining factors for health amongst the poverty gradient. According to Mosley, these factors prove challenging to individuals in poverty and are responsible for health deficits amongst the general impoverished population. Having sufficient access to a minimum amount of food that is nutritious and sanitary plays an important part in building health and reducing disease transmission. Access to sufficient amounts of quality water for drinking, bathing, and food preparation determines health and exposure to disease. Clothing that provides appropriate climatic protection and resources to wash clothes and bedding appropriately to prevent irritation, rashes, and parasitic life are also important to health.Housing, including size, quality, ventilation, crowding, sanitation, and separation, prove paramount in determining health and spread of disease. Availability of fuel for adequate sterilizing of eating utensils and food and the preservation of food proves necessary to promote health. Transportation, which provides access to medical care, shopping, and employment, proves absolutely essential. Hygienic and preventative care, including soap and insecticides, and vitamins and contraceptives, are necessary for maintaining health. Differential access to these life essentials depending on ability to afford with a given income results in differential health. Gender Gender can determine health inequity in general health and particular diseases, and is especially magnified in poverty. Socioeconomic inequality is often cited as the fundamental cause for differential health outcomes among men and women. According to the World Health Organization, the health gap between the impoverished and other populations will only be closed if the lives of women are improved and gender inequalities are solved. Therefore, the WHO sees gender empowerment as key in achieving fair distribution of health. The rate at which girls and women die relative to men is higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. \\"Globally, girls missing at birth and deaths from excess female mortality after birth add up to 6 million women a year, 3.9 million below the age of 60. Of the 6 million, one-fifth is never born, one-tenth dies in early childhood, one- fifth in the reproductive years, and two-fifths at older ages. Excess female deaths have persisted and even increased in countries immensely affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, like South Africa. In South Africa, excess female mortality between 10 and 50 years of age rose from close to zero to 74,000 deaths per year in 2008. In impoverished populations, there are pronounced differences in the types of illnesses and injuries men and women contract. According to Ward, poor women have more heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and infant mortality. Poor women also have significant comorbidity, or existence of two ailments, such as psychiatric disorders with psychoactive substance use. They are also at greater risk for contracting endemic conditions like tuberculosis, diabetes, and heart disease. Women of low socioeconomic status in urban areas are more liable to contract sexually transmitted diseases and have unplanned pregnancies. Global studies demonstrate that risk for contracting cervical cancer, exclusive to women, increases as socioeconomic status decreases. Household causes Health of poor women is impacted by gender inequalities through discriminating distribution of household goods, domestic violence, lack of agency, and unfair distribution of work, leisure, and opportunities between each gender. The way in which resources such as income, nourishment, and emotional support are traded in the household influences women's psychosocial health, nutrition, wellness, access to healthcare services, and threat of violence. The exchange of these elements in a home mediates in the impacts of geographical, cultural, and household patterns that result in inequality in health status and outcomes. Health-related behaviors, access and use of healthcare, stress, and psychosocial resources like social ties, coping, and spirituality all serve as factors that mediate health inequality. Household discrimination causes missing girls at birth, and the persistence of discrimination and poor service delivery perpetuates high female mortality. Societal causes Socioeconomic status has long been related to health, those higher in the social hierarchy typically enjoy better health than do those below. With respect to socioeconomic factors, poor institutions of public health and services can cause worse health in women. According to Moss, components of the geopolitical system that spawn gender and economic inequality, such as history of a nation, geography, policy, services, legal rights, organizations, institutions, and social structures, are all determinants of women's health in poverty. These structures, like socieo-demographic status and culture, norms and sanctions, shape women's productive role in the workplace and reproductive role in the household, which determines health. Women's social capital, gender roles, psychological stress, social resources, healthcare, and behavior form the social, economic, and cultural effects on health outcomes. Also, women facing financial difficulty are more likely to report chronic conditions of health, which occurs often in the lives of the impoverished. Socioeconomic inequality is often cited as the fundamental cause for differential health outcomes among men and women. Differences in socioeconomic status and resulting financial disempowerment for women explain the poorer health and lower healthcare utilization noted among older women compared to men in India, according to a study. According to another study, psycho-social factors also contribute to differences in reported health. First, women might report higher levels of health problems as a result of differential exposure or reduced access to material and social factors that foster health and well-being (Arber & Cooper, 1999) Second, women might report higher health problems because of differential vulnerability to material, behavioral, and psychosocial factors that foster health. Prenatal and maternal health Prenatal care also plays a role in the health of women and their children, with excess infant mortality in impoverished populations and nations representing these differentials in health. According to Ward, poverty is the strongest predictor of insufficient prenatal care, which is caused by three factors that reduce access. These include socieodemographic factors (such as age, ethnicity, marital status, and education), systematic barriers, and barriers based on lack of knowledge, attitudes and life-styles. Several studies show the complex associations between poverty and education, employment, teen births, and the health of the mother and child. In 1985, The World Health Organization estimated that maternal mortality rates were 150 times higher in developing countries than developed nations. Furthermore, increased rates of postpartum depression were found in mothers belonging to low socioeconomic status. Differential health for men There also exist differentials in health with respect to men. In many post-transition countries, like the Russian Federation, excess female mortality is not a problem, but rather there has been an increase in mortality risks for men. Evidence suggests that excess male mortality correlates with behavior considered socially acceptable among men, including smoking, binge drinking, and risky activities. According to Moss, \\"Women are more likely to experience role strain and overload that occur when familial responsibilities are combined with occupation-related stress.\\"  Age  Social determinants can have differential effects on health outcomes based on age group.  Youth health  Adolescent health has been proven to be influenced by both structural and proximal determinants, but structural determinants play the more significant role. Structural determinants such as national wealth, income inequality, and access to education have been found to affect adolescent health. Additionally, proximal determinants such as school and household environments are influenced by stratification created by structural determinants, can also affect adolescent health. Access to education was determined to be the most influential structural determinant affecting adolescent health.Proximal determinants include household and community factors, such as household environment, familial relationships, peer relationships, access to adequate food, and opportunities for recreation and activity. The most influential proximal determinant has proven to be family affluence. Family affluence directly affects food security, which correlates with adolescent nutrition and health. Family affluence also influences participation in regular physical activity. While nutrition and physical activity promote physical well-being, both promote psychological health as well. Thus family affluence is correlated with reduced psychological stress during adolescence. Family affluence also affects access to healthcare services; however, in countries with universal healthcare systems, youth belonging to less-affluent households still display poorer health than adolescents from wealthier families. One study (that followed individuals from childhood to adulthood) showed that housing environment impacted mortality, with the main cause of death being the presence of pollutants in the house. Higher rates of chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, as well as cigarette smoking were found in adolescents aged 10–21 belonging to low socioeconomic status.  Infant health  Poverty during pregnancy has been reported to cause a wide range of disparities in newborns. Low maternal socioeconomic status has been correlated with low infant birth weight and preterm delivery, physical complications such as ectopic pregnancy, poorer infant physical condition, compromised immune system and increased susceptibility to illness, and prenatal infant death. Sixty percent of children born into poor families have at least one chronic disease. Infant mental complications include delayed cognitive development, poor academic performance, and behavioral problems. Poor women display greater rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, and engagement in risky behaviors. Such risk factors function as stressors that, in combination with social factors such as crowded and unhygienic living environments, financial difficulties, and unemployment, affect fetus health. Ethnicity  Ethnicity can play an especially large part in determining health outcomes for impoverished minorities. Poverty can overpower race, but within poverty, race highly contributes to health outcomes. African Americans, even in some of the wealthiest cities in the United States, have lower life expectancy at birth than people in much poorer countries like China or India. In the United States, specifically for African American women, as of 2013 for every 100,000 births 43.5 black women would not survive compared to the 12.7 of white women According to studies, black individuals in South Africa suffer worse morbidity and mortality rates due to the limited access to social resources. Poverty is the chief cause of the endemic amounts of disease and hunger and malnutrition among this population. A disproportionate number of cases of the AIDS epidemic in North America are from American minorities, with 72% of women's AIDS cases among Hispanic or African-American women. Among those American minorities, African Americans comprise 12% of the American population yet, made up 45% of new HIV diagnoses. Blacks in American account for the highest proportion of those living with HIV and AIDS in America. Farmer says the growing mortality differentials between whites and blacks must be attributed to class differentials- which includes recognizing race within impoverished populations. Recognition of race as a determining factor for poor health without recognizing poverty has misled individuals to believe race is the only factor. A 2001 study showed that even with health care insurance, many African Americans and Hispanics lacked a health care provider; the numbers doubled for those without insurance (uninsured: White 12.9%, Black 21.0%, Hispanics 34.3%). With both race and insurance status as obstacles, their health care access and their health suffered. Health differentials amongst races can also serve as determining factors for other facets of life, including income and marital status. AIDS-affected Hispanic women hold smaller salaries than average women, are part of poorer families, and are more likely to head households. According to one study, black teenage women living in dysfunctional homes were more likely to have serious health issues for themselves or children. Education Education plays an especially influential part in the lives of the impoverished. According to Mirowsky and Ross, education determines other factors of livelihood like occupation and income that determines income, which determines health outcomes. Education is a major social determinant of health, with educational attainment related to improved health outcomes, due to its effect on income, employment, and living conditions. Social resources, such as education, determine life expectancy and infant mortality, which measures health. Education has a lasting, continuous, and increasing effect on health. Education is a special determinant of health because it enables people toward self-direction, which leads them to seek goals such as health. Education helps the impoverished develop usable skills, abilities, and resources that help individuals reach goals, including bettering health. Parent's educational level is also important to health, which influences the health of children and the future population. Parent's education level also determines child health, survival, and their educational attainment (Caldwell, 1986; Cleland & Van Ginneken, 1988). \\"Children born to more educated mothers are less likely to die in infancy and more likely to have higher birth weights and be immunized. Studies in the United States suggest maternal education results in higher parity, greater use of prenatal care, and lower smoking rates, which positively affects child health. An increase in child schooling in Taiwan during the educational reform of 1968 reduced the infant morality rate by 11%, saving 1 infant per 1000 births. \\"Fig. 2.1 shows variation between countries in infant mortality from just over 20/1000 live births in Colombia to just over 120 in Mozambique. It also shows inequities within countries – an infant's chances of survival are closely related to her mother's education. In Bolivia, babies born to women with no education have infant mortality greater than 100 per 1000 live births; the infant mortality rate of babies born to mothers with at least secondary education is under 40/1000.All countries included in Fig. 2.1 show the survival disadvantage of children born to women with no education.\\" Mortality inequalities are produced and reproduced by policies that promotes structural violence for those who are already vulnerable to poverty, while reinforcing the paradigm and the ontological order of power hierarchy. Hence, the political engagement of an individual and their communities play an important factor in determining their access to health care. The Commission on the Social Determinants of Health discusses that explicit commitment to action through multidisciplinary public policies are required for better access to healthcare. One of the recommended action is to expand knowledge and empower the participation of broad segment of society.Wilkinson, R. G., & Marmot, M. (2003). Social Determinants of Health: The Solid Facts. World Health Organization. A manifestation of such action is the mobilization of the population that has been historically oppressed and to raise question about the systemic issues affecting their life. According to WHO, civic participation does not just better physical health, but also mental health status, and overall life quality. History exhibits that when the masses become politically aware of the problems around them, they are more empowered to find their own voice and revolt against systemic inequalities to take control of their lives and improve healthcare accessibility and affordability. On the contrary, nations that do not empower its citizens to be politically educated have way worse health outcomes than nations whose citizens are politically engaged. For instance, there has been a surge in mortality differentials and unwavering decline in health benefits coverage, especially among for the population living under poverty line. As stated in Global Health Promotion, over the last 10 years there has been a steady loss of health coverage for 1 million people every year. Losing health coverage means that an individual could no longer seek affordable treatment or access healthcare, so their health quality would eventually deteriorate. However, if the citizens were to raise their concerns collective to the government, they would have been able to address this systemic factor and subsequently improve their health outcomes.  Occupation  Impoverished workers are more likely to hold part-time jobs, move in and out of work, be migrant workers, or experience stress associated with being unemployed and searching unsuccessfully for unemployment, which all in turn affects health outcomes. According to the World Health Organization, employment and working conditions greatly affect health equity (Kivimaki et al., 2003). This occurs because poor employment conditions exposes individuals to health hazards, which are more likely for low-status jobs. Evidence confirms that high job demand, low control, and low rewards for effort in these low status jobs are risk factors for mental and physical health problems, such as a 50% excess risk of heart disease (Stansfeld & Candy, 2006). The growing power of massive, conglomerate global corporations and institutions to set labor policy and standards agendas has disempowered workers, unions, and the job-seeking by subjecting these individuals to health-damaging working conditions. (EMCONET, 2007). In high- income countries, there has been a growth in job insecurity and precarious employment arrangements (such as informal work, temporary work, part-time work, and piecework), job losses, and a weakening of regulatory protections. Informal work can threaten health through its precarious job instability, lack of regulation to protect working conditions and occupational health and safety. Evidence from the WHO suggests mortality is greater among temporary workers than permanent workers. (Kivimaki et al., 2003). Since most of the global workforce operates under the informal economy, particularly low- and middle-income countries, impoverished populations are greatly affected by these factors. ==Socioeconomic and political context== Location Nation-state/geographical region Which particular nation an impoverished person lives in deeply affects health outcomes. This can be attributed to governmental, environmental, geographical, and cultural factors. Using life expectancy as a measure of health indicates a difference between countries in likeliness of living to a certain age. Where people are born dramatically impacts their life chances. High-income countries like Japan or Sweden have a life expectancy of 80 years, Brazil-72, India-63. The WHO cites that for rich countries, only 56 (Iceland) to 107 (US) of 1000 adults between 15 and 60 years old will die each year, while Western and Central African countries have adult mortality rates exceeding 300 and 400 of every 1000. The rates are even higher in African nations suffering the AIDS epidemic, such as Zimbabwe where 772 of 1000 adults die each year (WHO 2010). Also, the type of health affliction varies by countries for populations in poverty. Over 80% of cardiovascular disease deaths, that totaled 17.5 million people globally in 2005, occur in low- and middle-income countries. According to the WHO,13500 people die from smoking every day, and soon it will become the leading cause of death in developing countries, just as in high income countries. (Mathers & Loncar, 2005). Infant and maternal mortality also reveals disparity in health between nations. There exist great inequalities in infant death rates within and between countries, ranging from 20/10000 births in Columbia to 120/10000 in Mozambique. In 1985, The World Health Organization estimated that maternal mortality rates were 150 times higher in developing countries than developed nations. Urban or rural location =Urban= The location where people live affects their health and life outcomes, which means impoverished people's health outcomes are especially determined by whether they live in a metropolitan area or rural area. In the 19th and 20th century, slums developed in cities and the ensuing crowding, poor sanitation, and inadequate dwellings brought infectious disease and illnesses, causing public health concerns. With the prevalence of inner city ghettos and slums around the globe in cities, with approximately 1 billion people living in slums globally, living situation is an especially strong determinant of health in poverty. Urban areas present health risks through poor living conditions, limited food resources, traffic accidents, and pollution. Urbanization is immensely altering public health problems, particularly for the poor, by directing it towards non-communicable diseases, accidental and violent injuries, and death and health impacts from ecological disaster. (Capbell &Campbell;, 2007; Yusuf et al., 2001). Daily living conditions enormously impact health equity too. Equity in living conditions, such as access to quality housing and clean water and hygiene, have been greatly degraded in urban areas by increasing car dependence, land use for roads, inconvenience of non-car transportation, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and lack of physical activity (NHF, 2007). The challenges of urban areas, such as high population density, crowding, unsuitable living conditions, and little social support, provide a special challenge to the disabled and populations in low and middle income countries(Frumkin et al., 2004). *Obesity: Obesity is a paramount problem, especially among the poor and socially disadvantaged, in cities worldwide, according to the WHO (Hawkes et al., 2007; Friel, Chopra & Satcher, 2007). The increased amount of obesity can be contributed to the nutrition transition that describes how people are now increasingly turning to high-fat, sugar, and salt food sources because of their availability and price. This food transition has fueled the obesity epidemic. This nutrition transition tends to start in cities because of \\"greater availability, accessibility, and acceptability of bulk purchases, convenience foods, and 'supersized' portions\\" (Dixon et al., 2007). Physical activity and exercise is strongly determined by the design of cities, including density of homes, heterogeneous land uses, the extent to which streets and sidewalks connect, the walkability, and the provision of and access to local public accommodations and parks for recreation and play. These factors, along with increasing reliance on cars, results in the shift of the population toward physical inactivity, which damages health (Friel, Chopra & Satcher, 2007). *Crime: Violence and crime are major urban health challenges. Worldwide, 90% of the 1.6 million annual violent deaths occur in low and middle income counties(WHO, 2002). A large number of deaths and injuries occur because of crime, which affects health. *Traffic: Individuals in ghettos and urban areas are the most affected by traffic injuries and vehicle-created air pollution, which causes 800,000 annual deaths due to air pollution, and 1.2 million from traffic accidents. (Roberts & Meddings, 2007; Prüss- Üstün & Corvalán, 2006). This results in greater health risks, like death, for impoverished populations in cities. *Mental illness: Living in a ghetto increases the likelihood of developing a mental illness, especially in children. People in this environment are less likely to receive effective mental health services. Children exposed to ongoing poverty, present in a ghetto, present a high level of depression, anxiety, social withdrawal, peer conflict and aggression.(McLeod & Shanahan, 1997) Mental health symptoms are increased in the ghetto due to exposure to community crime, gang induced violence, neighborhood drug infestations, and substandard housing conditions.(González 2005) * Other: In the United States, HIV is more prevalent in cities along the east coast, with prevalence among African-American women in cities 5 to 15 times higher than for women in all areas of that state. \\"Inner-city women are the most likely of all in the United States to birth dead or extremely sick babies, partially because the massive erosion of prenatal care availability in their area. Slums, made up exclusively of extremely poor populations, provide a particularly strong threat for poor health. Child mortality in the slums of Nairobi, which 60% of the population inhabits, is 2.5 times greater than in other areas of the city. In the slums of Manila, 39% of children have TB, which is twice the national average. The term ‘housing instability’ describes a condition in which people have been or will be homeless in the future. People facing such instability have poorer health care access and more acute health problems than the rest of the population. A city populations grew and rents rose, those receiving Section 9 housing vouchers could no longer afford the rising rents and were forced to move away. =Rural= Living in a rural community, whether in the United States, or around the globe, reduces access to medical services, health insurance, and changes health culture. Differentials exist between rural and urban communities, and some health disadvantages exist for impoverished rural residents. Since health of a population increases in geographical locations that have a higher prevalence of primary care physicians, rural areas face worse health. According to certain studies, measures of health and well-being indicate that rural populations have worse health outcomes. Rural residents have a greater rate of premature mortality (less than age 75 at death) than urban residents. According to certain studies in the United States, the death rate of individuals age 1–24 years was 31% higher than those in urban counties. The death rate of adults 25 to 64 years old was 32% higher among rural residents than those of suburban counties and of urban counties. These higher death rates were contributed to unintentional injuries, suicide, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In 1997 in the United States, 18% of adults in rural areas had chronic health conditions, compared to only 13% of suburban adults. The National Health Interview Survey indicated that in 1998, 16% of rural adults reported poor health. Poor rural residents have only 21% Medicaid coverage, while poor urban populations report 30% coverage. Demographic and socioeconomic factors vary between rural and urban areas, which contributes to some health disparities. For extremely poor rural communities, variables in the community, like ecological setting, including climate, soil, rainfall, temperature, altitude, and seasonality greatly impact health. \\"In rural subsistence societies, these variables can have strong influence on child survival by affecting the quantity and variety of food crops produced, the availability and quality of water, vector-borne disease transmission\\" Governance/policy Type and structure of governments and their social and economic policy more deeply affects the health of the impoverished than other populations. Every component of government- from finance, education, housing, employment, transportation, and health policy- affects population health and health equity. Life expectancy variation between countries can be partially attributed to the type of political regime, whether that be fascist, communist, conservative, or social- democratic. It is suggested by WHO that those who are the most vulnerable and affected by policy changes that influence their quality of health should have a direct hand in the construction and adoption of these same policies. This power in contribution would have a positive impact on their health outcomes, due to their ability to participate autonomously in policies that influence their health. However, changing the status of government regime does not always end the type of policies in place, as seen in South Africa. The end of South Africa's apartheid regime has still not dismantled the structures of inequality and oppression, which has led the persistent social inequality to perpetuate the spread of HIV, diminishing population health. Also, the political economy, encompassing production organization, physical infrastructure, and political institutions [9] play a large role in determining health inequalities. Social service and healthcare availability No usual source of healthcare due to weak social safety net The social environment that impoverished people dwell in is often a precursor to the quality of their health outcomes. Without equitable access to basic social needs, it is difficult to have a quality standard of health while under a significant financial burden. The Commission of Social Determinants of Health, created in 2015 by the World Health Organization, was a pioneer in the push for more focus on \\"creating better social conditions for health, particularly among the most vulnerable people”. These basic social needs that influence social environment include food security, housing, education, transportation, healthcare access and more factors that can affect health. Social services and social service programs, which provide support in access to basic social needs, are made critical in the improvement in health conditions of the impoverished. Impoverished people depend on healthcare and other social services to be provided in the social safety net, therefore availability greatly determines health outcomes. Since low living standards greatly influence health inequity, generous social protection systems result in greater population health, with lower mortality rates, especially in disadvantaged populations. A successful example of such social service program is the Senior Companion program, an extension of the United States federal program Senior Corps. The program provides assistance for adults who have physical and mental disadvantages. It pairs up senior volunteers with patients who come from low-income background to help them increase their social capability, ability to live independently and more accessibility to healthcare. A mixed-method study explores that the program does target various social determinants of health and have positive effects on enrolled elders' health status (although less positive correlation long-term). It concludes that the program does have enthusiastic impacts on clients and volunteers' overall wellness. The result is homogeneous with conclusions from other studies, with emerging themes include: companionship, reduced depression, access to healthcare, isolation, and increased social network. Another example of a utilized social service program in Northern California is the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland Find Program. This program employs a method of addressing the social determinants of health, liaison work, contextualized by their predominantly impoverished patient population. This liaison work involves caseworkers in the clinic connecting patients to basic social needs resources. Similar positive results have been found, suggesting that this liaison work is effective in bettering the health status of those in marginalized positions of society. Nations that have more generous social protection systems have better population health (Lundberg et al., 2007). More generous family policies correlate with lower infant mortality. Nations that offered higher coverage and reimbursement for pensions and sickness, unemployment, and employment accident insurance have a higher LEB (Lundberg et al., 2007), as well as countries with more liberal pensions have less senior mortality. (Lundberg et al., 2007) Access to Healthcare The health care system represents a social determinant of health as well as it influences other determining factors. People's access to health care, their experiences there, and the benefits they gain are closely related to other social determinants of health like income, gender, education, ethnicity, occupation, and more. For poor people, systematic barriers in the social structure are formidable, especially financing. Medicaid and maternity coverage structures have complex and time-consuming registration processes, along with long waits and unsure eligibility. A study of the Emergency Department found that the majority of patients presenting with mental illness were those on Medical (20.4%) and Medicare (31.5%), whereas only 12.4% of privately insured patients presented with mental illness. California has expanded its eligibility of Medi-Cal under federal law to cover as many people as possible. Inequalities in health are also determined by these socioeconomic and cultural factors. Health care is inequitably distributed globally, with pronounced inequality for the poor in low- and middle-income countries. One study demonstrated that doctors treat poor populations differently, showing that disadvantaged patients are less likely to receive the recommended diabetic treatments and are more likely to undergo hospitalization due to the complications of diabetes (Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, 2003). According to the WHO, healthcare systems can most improve health equality when institutions are organized to provide universal coverage, where everyone receives the same quality healthcare regardless of ability to pay, as well as a Primary Healthcare system rather than emergency center assistance. These structural problems result in worse healthcare and therefore worse health outcomes for impoverished populations. Health care costs can pose absolutely serious threats to impoverished populations, especially in countries without proper social provisions. According to US HHS, \\"In 2009, children 6–17 years of age were more likely to be uninsured than younger children, and children with a family income below 200% of the poverty level were more likely to be uninsured than children in higher-income families.\\" In elderly populations, individuals below 400% of the poverty line were between 3 and 5 times more likely to lack insurance. Children below 200% of the poverty line were also less likely to have insurance than wealthier families. Also, in 2009 in the US, 20% of adults (ages 18–64) below 200% of the poverty line did not receive their necessary drugs because of cost, compared to only 4% of those above 400% of the poverty line. Increasing healthcare costs (including higher premiums) imposed a burden on consumers. In 2010, President Obama introduced the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), expanding health care to many that lacked coverage. The U.S. had the highest rate of uninsured people, and the highest health care costs, of all industrialized nations at the time. The ACA helped 20 million Americans get coverage and decreased the rates of uninsured from 16% in 2010 to 8.6% in 2016. The ACA brought coverage to people who had suffered from downgrades in Employee Insurance programs, by providing a health insurance marketplace, giving them access to private insurance plans along with income- based government subsidies. This can be seen in other nations, where in Asia, payments for healthcare pushed almost 3% of the population of 11 countries below 1 US$ per day. However, under the current U.S. administration, there have been shifts in how federal funding is allocated to social service programs. Although, initiatives like the National Prevention Council have been established to address prevention, there have also been some drawbacks. Because of this political shift, entities that address the social determinants of health in poverty, like social service programs, are threatened under these new policies. These policies reallocate funding away from public social service programs, causing resources that promote prevention and public health to be limited. The problem most present with state provisioned resources like public social service programs that aim to alleviate health disparities are the ever changing political spheres that either propel or block communities from access to effective health care resources and interventions. Despite the strength of political influences, it has been shown that, globally, shifting attention to addressing social needs like healthcare access has dramatically affected the health of impoverished communities. Societal psychological influences In impoverished communities, different social norms and stressors exist than in other populations, which can greatly affect health outcomes in disadvantaged populations. According to the National Institutes of Health, \\"low socioeconomic status may result in poor physical and/or mental health ... through various psychosocial mechanisms such as poor or \\"risky\\" health-related behaviors, social exclusion, prolonged and/ or heightened stress, loss of sense of control, and low self-esteem as well as through differential access to proper nutrition and to health and social services (National Institutes of Health 1998).\\" These stressors can cause physiological alterations including increased cortisol, changed blood-pressure, and reduced immunity which increases their risks for poor health. Structural violence Underlying social structures that propagate and perpetuate poverty and suffering- structural violence- majorly determine health outcomes of impoverished populations. Poor and unequal living conditions result from deeper structural conditions, including \\"poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and bad politics,\\" that determine the way societies are organized. The structure of the global system causes inequality and systematic suffering of higher death rates, which is caused by inequity in distribution of opportunities and resources, which is termed structural violence. Definition Structural violence is a term devised by Johan Galtung and liberation theologians during the 1960s to describe economic, political, legal, religious, and cultural social structures that harm and inhibit individuals, groups, and societies from reaching their full potential. Structural violence is structural because the causes of misery are \\"embedded in the political and economic organization of our social world; they are violent because they cause injury to people.\\" Structural violence is different from personal or behavioral violence because it exclusively refers to preventable harm done to people by no one clear individual, but arises from unequal distribution of power and resources, pre-built into social structure. Structural violence broadly includes all kinds of violations of human dignity: absolute and relative poverty, social inequalities like gender inequality and racism, and outright displays of human rights violations. The idea of structural violence is as old as the study of conflict and violence, and so it can also be understood as related to social injustice and oppression. Effects Structural violence is often embedded in longstanding social structures, ubiquitous throughout the globe, that are regularized by persistent institutions and regular experience with them. These social structures seem so normal in our understanding of the world that they are almost invisible, but inequality in resource access, political power, education, healthcare, and legal standing are all possible perpetrators of structural violence. Non citizens do not have access to medical insurance and healthcare and must seek care in clinics and outpatient departments. Structural violence occurs \\"whenever persons are harmed, maimed, or killed by poverty and unjust social, political, and economic institutions, systems, or structures\\" Structural violence can contribute to worse health outcomes through either harming or killing victims, just like armed violence can have these effects. This type of unintended harm perpetuated by structural violence progressively promotes misery and hunger that eventually results in death, among other effects. Ehrlich and Ehrlich reported in 1970 that between 10 and 20 million of the 60 million annual deaths across the globe result from starvation and malnutrition. Their report also estimated that structural violence was responsible for the end of one billion lives between 1948 and 1967 in the third world. Structural violence connection to health Inequality in daily living conditions stem from unseen social structures and practices. This systematic inequality is produced by social norms, policies, and practices that promote the unfair distribution of power, wealth, and other social resources, such as healthcare. \\"The poor health of the poor, the social gradient in health within countries, and the marked health inequities between countries are caused by the unequal distribution of power, income, goods, and services, globally and nationally.\\" First, structural violence is often a major determinant of the distribution and outcome of disease. It has been known for decades that epidemic disease is caused by structural forces. Structural violence can affect disease progression, such as in HIV, where harmful social structures profoundly affect diagnosis, staging, and treatment of HIV and associated illnesses. The determinants of disease and their outcome are set by the social factors, usually rampant with structural violence, that determine risk to be infected with the disease. Understanding how structural violence is embodied at the community, individual, and microbial levels is vital to understanding the dynamics of disease. The consequences of structural violence is post pronounced in the world's poorest countries and greatly affects the provision of clinical services in these countries. Elements of structural violence such as \\"social upheaval, poverty, and gender inequality decrease the effectiveness of distal services and of prevention efforts\\" presents barriers to medical care in countries like Rwanda and Haiti Due to structural violence, there exists a growing outcome gap where some countries have access to interventions and treatment, and countries in poverty who are neglected. With the power of improved distal interventions, the only way to close this outcome gap between countries who do and do not have access to effective treatment, lies on proximal interventions to reduce the factors contributing to health problems that arise from structural violence. == See also == *Diseases of poverty *Socioeconomic status and mental health == References == Category:Economic inequality Category:Health economics Category:Poverty Category:Determinants of health Category:Social problems in medicine ","title":"Social determinants of health in poverty"},{"id":"35296413","text":"Angela Malone (born in 1971) is the author of Lucia's Measure, the story of a giantess.

It looks for ways to use whales in Chilean waters and preserve the marine ecosystem that do not involve killing the whales. It is recognized as a marine conservation initiative of national interest. In 2008 the government of Chile agreed with the Alfaguara Project's request to establish a whale sanctuary following a poll in which 98% of citizens voted in favor. The project depends on the informed participation of the northwest coastal community of Chiloé and also involves national authorities and international experts. It is sponsored by the General Directorate of Maritime Territory and Merchant Marine and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It has been assisted by the Rufford Maurice Laing Foundation, Global Ocean and the Mohamed bin Zayed Species Conservation Fund. The Pacific Whale Foundation provided funding for the 2012 season. ==Conservation issues== The part of the Chilean Sea immediately northwest of Chiloé is an important long-term feeding area for blue whales. In the period between 1926 and 1967 whaling ships slaughtered about 97% of the blue whales in the southern Pacific. The relatively small and isolated population remaining near the Chiloé is threatened by the risk of collision from increasing volumes of shipping, noise and pollution from a Norwegian salmon farming operation and possibly from rising ocean temperatures leading to changes in the food species available to the whales. A 2007 survey showed that many of the whales feeding in the area were thin and/or had skin lesions. Causes of the skin lesions include cookiecutter shark bites and skin disease, thought to be caused by types of calicivirus and poxvirus. Both families of virus are associated with a degraded marine environment. ==Conservation activities== 280px Investigators have been identifying individual whales through examination of photographs that show the patterns on their flanks. In the 2007 season the project made 17 marine surveys, photo-identifying 188 individuals. The researchers also collected samples of faeces and zooplankton, made sound recordings, measured environmental parameters and collected data about individual behavior. The 2007 surveys also recording humpback whales and Risso's dolphins. Data was supplemented by land-based observations and aerial surveys. As of 2012 the team had identified 363 individuals, with almost one third seen more than once in the period between 2009 and 2011. The detailed information will provide deeper understanding of the whales' habits and how they are affected by changes to their environment, including acoustic issues. Other species such as fin whales, sei whales, and southern minke whales are also confirmed in the area. Possibly, the region is functioning as the most important forging area for critically endangered southern right whales that face near extinction in the nation. ==Ecotourism== Penguins on the Islote 1 Puñihuil The coastal community has been involved in whale spotting and in developing responsible marine ecotourism, thus contributing to the conservation program while benefiting from it economically. Whales may be sighted from the shore. Boat- based whale watching is limited by the weather conditions and type of vessel required to perhaps 1,000 visitors annually, but should be economically viable. There is additional revenue potential from providing food and lodging to ecotourists, sale of souvenirs, trekking and horse-riding and other activities. Other areas such as around Caleta Zorra are also suitable for whale watching activities.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPa4_y3cpS0 Chiloé is home to the main colony of sea lions in Chile. Three islands about off the Puñihuil beach are important breeding sites for Magellanic and Humboldt penguins in the summer months between September and March. The islands are also breeding grounds for sooty shearwater and are home to endangered marine otters. In 1999 they were designated the Islotes de Puñihuil Natural Monument. Following a study by the Alfaguara Project the ecotourism boat operators agreed to work together as an association, reducing the number of penguin- watching trips to the islands so as to maximize net income. ==See also== * Cetacean Conservation Center * Corcovado National Park (Chile) * Chiloé National Park ==References== Category:Chiloé Archipelago Category:Baleen whales Category:Nature conservation in Chile Category:Whale conservation Category:Blue whales Category:Animal welfare organisations based in Chile ","title":"Alfaguara project"},{"id":"35296516","text":"The 2012 Gardner–Webb Runnin' Bulldogs football team represented Gardner–Webb University in the 2012 NCAA Division I FCS football season.

His specialty was the geography of the ancient Mediterranean and Chinese geography. He also published a number of works theorizing on the location of Atlantis. ==Career== The son of Konrad Herrmann (1844-1910), Albert studied at the universities of Göttingen and Berlin. He took his doctor's degree under H. Wagner, studying the course of the Silk Road. He furthered his studies at the Berlin's Oriental Institute, earning the Diploma of Oriental Languages in 1915. He became a member of the Geographical Society of Berlin and the German Oriental Society. In 1923 he obtained a Chair of Historical Geography at the University of Berlin. Besides his fundamental research in the field of Chinese Geography, his most famous work is Historical and commercial Atlas of China (1935), which was in use worldwide. He died on 19 April 1945, due to wounds received during an air bombardment of the railway station in Pilsen. ==Search for Atlantis== Herrmann was a believer in Paul Borchardt's Atlantis theories, believing Atlantis to have been located in Tunisia. Due to his position within the Nazi Party, he theories carried considerable weight in the German press. In 1925 he received funding for an expedition to Tunisia. Believing he had found evidence for the site of Atlantis in the village of Rhelissia, he theorised that Plato's descriptions of the lost city had been incorrect, and argued that it had in fact existed as recently as the 14th century BCE. Herrmann went on to extrapolate that Atlantis was in fact a colony of Frisland, and that civilisation was therefore Frisian in origin. ==Works== Map showing European explorations in 1486–1616 from Herrmann's atlas of China, 1935 * Die alte Seidenstrassen zwischen China und Syrien: Beiträge zur alten Geographie Asiens.

It was spotted a year later by a routine Royal Canadian Air Force air patrol about off the coast of Haida Gwaii, British Columbia. The unmanned hulk entered U.S. waters on 1 April 2012, and, after salvage attempts failed, was sunk by the U.S. Coast Guard on 5 April 2012 to prevent the hulk from becoming a hazard to navigation. ==History== The USCG directs streams of water at the Japanese vessel in Gulf of Alaska after it was shelled by the Anacapa. Holes from the shelling are clearly visible in the side of the fishing boat. The Ryou-Un Maru, a fishing vessel in the Japanese merchant fleet, was originally built around 1982. It was owned by a Hokkaido-based fishing company and was used for shrimping or squidding. After a long service career the ship's owner decided it was too old for continued use and moored it in Aomori Prefecture in Honshu pending sale. When the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami struck in March 2011, Ryou-Un Maru broke free and was set adrift. Like most countries, Japanese law requires a ship be disposed of or dismantled properly before allowing its registration to be canceled. However, all parties assumed the vessel sank in the disaster, so the Japan Coast Guard granted the owner an exception. For over a year the Ryou-Un Maru drifted across the Pacific as a ghost ship. On 20 March 2012, it was spotted in Canadian waters by Royal Canadian Air Force CP-140 Aurora aircraft. As its registration had been canceled, the ship no longer had a legal owner responsible for it. On 4 April 2012, the U.S. Coast Guard dropped a tracking buoy aboard as the vessel drifted approximately southwest of Sitka, Alaska. The next day, the crew of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter assessed the ship's condition. Video of the sinking of the Ryou-Un Maru On 5 April 2012, the Canadian fishing vessel Bernice C attempted to salvage the stricken vessel, but a ruptured fuel tank proved impossible to pump out and a tow failed.CBC News, \\"The National\\", airdate: 5 April 2012. The U.S. Coast Guard then determined that sinking the abandoned vessel was necessary to prevent it running aground or becoming a hazard to navigation. USCGC Anacapa fired upon it with a Mk 38 25mm autocannon, holing and sinking the Ryou-Un Maru in approximately of water in the Gulf of Alaska off the coast of the Alaskan Panhandle. ==Legacy== Composer Gabriel Lubell wrote a bassoon quartet in 2013 based on the story of Ryou-Un Maru. The work is titled The Curious Journey of the Ryō-un Maru and, while not literally interpreting any of the actual events that took place, reflects on the ship's life and fate. Guitar composer Egle Sommacal wrote in 2015 a guitar track Ryou-Un Maru in his album \\"il cielo si sta oscurando\\" In 2015, composer Scott Morgan, who uses stage-name Loscil released an iOS/Android app which functions as a continuously changing aleatory sound work, dedicated to ships that have been set adrift, including the Ryou-Un Maru alongside ships Bannockburn, Baychimo, and Orlova, each of which features as a titled 'track' on the app. ==References *U.S. Coast Guard photos of shelling *U.S. Coast Guard video of the ship being fired upon *MFV Ryou-Un Maru (+2012) Wrecksite.eu Category:2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami Category:Fishing vessels of Japan Category:Shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean Category:Maritime incidents in 2012 Category:1982 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 2011 Category:Ghost ships ","title":"Ryou-Un Maru"},{"id":"35296633","text":"Women's education in Pakistan is a fundamental right of every female citizen, according to article thirty-seven of the Constitution of Pakistan,Constitution of Pakistan, Government of Pakistan but gender discrepancies still exist in the educational sector. According to the 2011 Human Development Report of the United Nations Development Program, approximately twice as many males as females receive a secondary education in Pakistan, and public expenditures on education amount to only 2.7% of the GDP of the country.UNDP, Human Development Report (2011) ==Gender roles in Pakistan== Patriarchal values heavily govern the social structure in Pakistani society in the rural areas. In comparison, urban centers of the country as well as semi-peripheral regions are slowly moving towards shifting gender roles that are more inclusive. Around 70% of working women in Pakistan work outdoors according to the Asian Development Bank policy brief on female workforce participation in Pakistan 2016. The general perception of culturally traditional gender roles that, specifically, a woman is expected to take care of the home as wife and mother, whereas the male dominates outside the home as a breadwinner, are questionable in certain sectors. In agricultural work, within rural areas, both men and women work in the fields and are expected to contribute equally to household work. In a survey by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics 2013–2014, it was reported that 26% of women are in the labor force ( approximately 15 million). There is a traditionally conceptual idea of segregation of men and women into two distinct worlds. However, this materializes differently in different parts of the country. Only in the most of rural-isolated regions in the country is this idea of gender roles strictly followed. Poverty is one of the major factors in unequal household resources allocation in the favor of sons due to their role in society outside the home. Therefore, education for boys is prioritized over that for girls, because it is perceived that boys must be equipped with educational skills to compete for resources in the public arena; while girls have to specialize in domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Hence, education is not perceived as being important for girls. This gender division of labor has been internalized by the society, and girls do not have many choices for themselves that could change these patriarchal realities of their lives. Society does not allow girls to develop their human capabilities by precluding them from acquiring education. Lack of emphasis on the importance of women's education is one of the cardinal features of gender inequality in Pakistan.Chaudhry, I. & Rahman, S. (2009). \\"The Impact of Gender Inequality in Education on Rural Poverty in Pakistan: An Empirical Analysis\\". European Journal of Economics, Finance and Administrative Sciences, Issue 15, 2009. The Human Development Report (HDR) listed Pakistan in the category of \\"low human development\\" countries with a female literacy rate of thirty percent, and Pakistan has ranked 145 in the world in terms of human development. Importance of women's education Education has been of central significance to the development of human society. It can be the beginning, not only of individual knowledge, information and awareness, but also a holistic strategy for development and change.Dr. Noureen, G. & Dr. Awan, R. (2011). \\"Women's Education in Pakistan:Hidden Fences on Open Frontiers\\". Asian Social Science, Vol. 7, No. 2; 2011. Education is very much connected to women's ability to form social relationships on the basis of equality with others and to achieve the important social good of self-respect. It is important, as well, to mobility (through access to jobs and the political process) and to health and life (through the connection to bodily integrity).Education serves as a protection to domestic violence. Domestic violence is a major factor that negatively affects the advancement of women. One of the significant goals of education in Pakistani women is its contribution to the labor market. Education empowers women to have a voice in the decision-making process in a male-dominated household, limiting men to influence the women's involvement in paid jobs that contribute to the country’s economy, thus improving Pakistan's status of women. Education can allow women to participate in politics so they can ensure that their voices and concerns are heard and addressed in the public policy. It is also crucial for women's access to the legal system.Nussbaum, M. (2003). Women's Education: A Global Challenge. University of Chicago. Although it must be considered that religion and traditions of the Pakistani affect women's education. Some women may choose to keep the traditional roles because that is what they have always known and are used to. It would be a great opportunity if women were able to make their choice on their own, though. They should at least have the knowledge of both sides to be educated or to stay with the traditional ways. Education is a critical input in human resource development and essential for the country's economic growth. It increases the productivity and efficiency of individuals, and it produces a skilled labor force that is capable of leading the economy towards sustainable growth and prosperity. The progress and wellbeing of a country largely depends on the education choices made available to its people. It can be one of the most powerful instruments of change. It can help a country to achieve its national goals via producing minds imbued with knowledge, skills, and competencies to shape its future destiny. The widespread recognition of this fact has created awareness on the need to focus upon literacy and elementary education, not simply as a matter of social justice but more to foster economic growth, social well-being, and social stability.Mishra R. C. (2005). Women Education. New Delhi: A.P.H. Publishing Corporation. Women's education is so inextricably linked with the other facets of human development that to make it a priority is to also make change on a range of other fronts; from the health and status of women to early childhood care; from nutrition, water and sanitation to community empowerment; from the reduction of child labor and other forms of exploitation to the peaceful resolution of conflicts.Goel, A. (2004). Education and Socio-Economic Perspectives of Women Development and Empowerment. Economic benefits of women's education Apart from the acquisition of knowledge and values conductive to social evolution, education also enables development of mind, training in logical and analytical thinking. It allows an individual to acquire organizational, managerial, and administrative skills. Moreover, enhanced self-esteem and improved social and financial status within a community is a direct outcome of education. Therefore, by promoting education among women, Pakistan can achieve social and human development, and gender equality. A large number of empirical studies have revealed that increase in women's education boosts their wages and that returns to education for women are frequently larger than that of men. Increase in the level of female education improves human development outcomes such as child survival, health and schooling.Klasen, S. and Lamanna, F. (2008), The Impact of Gender Inequality in Education and Employment on Economic Growth in Development Countries: Updates and Extensions. Lower female education has a negative impact on economic growth as it lowers the average level of human capital.Klasen, Stephan (1999). \\"Does Gender Inequality Reduce Growth and development? Evidence from Cross-Country Regressions\\", Policy Research Report On Gender and Development Working Paper Series, No. 7. Development Research Group /PREMN, the World Bank. Developmental Economists argue that in developing countries female education reduces fertility, infant mortality and increases children's education.Knowles, Stephen, Paula K. Lorgelly, and P. Dorian Owen (2002) \\"Are Educational Gender Gaps a Brake on Economic Development? Some Cross-Country Empirical Evidence\\", Oxford Economic Papers, 54(1): 118–149. Gender inequality in education directly and significantly affects economic growth. Empirical studies done by using regression analysis reveal the fact that the overall literacy rate, enrollment ratio, ratio of literate female to male have positive and significant impact on economic growth.Chaudhry, I.S. (2007), \\"Impact of Gender Inequality in Education on Economic Growth: An Empirical Evidence from Pakistan\\", The Pakistan Horizon Vol. 60, No. 4, 2007. Chaudhry (2007) investigated the impact of gender inequality in education on economic growth in Pakistan. The secondary source of time series data drawn from various issues has been used. In his regression analysis, he estimated a set of regressions showing a moderate explanatory power. The variables, overall literacy rate, enrollment ratio, ratio of literate female to male have positive and significant impact on economic growth. It was found that gender inequality in initial education reduces economic growth. In another empirical study, Chaudhry (2009) investigated factors affecting rural poverty in Southern Punjab (Pakistan), and he concluded that alleviation of poverty is possible by lowering the household size and dependency ratio, improving education, increasing female labor participation. He employed Logit regression models and used primary source of data from the project area of Asian Development Bank for estimation. Results indicate that as dependency level and household size increase the probability of being poor increases too. Education has the significant inverse relationship with poverty because it provides employment opportunities and rejects poverty.Chaudhry, I.S. (2009), \\"Poverty Alleviation in Southern Punjab (Pakistan): An Empirical Evidence from the Project Area of Asian Development Bank\\", International Research journal of Finance and Economics, issue 23, (2009). The inclusion of trained and education women workforce will not only ensure women's welfare, it will also increase the overall productivity of the workforce due to more competitiveness. Hence, the developmental and feminist economists argue that it is desirable for the government to allocate more resources towards women's education, as it is going to benefit the whole society. ==Gender disparity in education in Pakistan== According to UNDP 2010 report, Pakistan ranked 120 in 146 countries in terms of Gender-related Development Index (GDI), and in terms of Gender Empowerment Measurement (GEM) ranking, it ranked 92 in 94 countries.UNDP (2010), \\"Statement on Gender in Pakistan\\". Gender inequality in education can be measured in different ways. Gross and net enrollment rates and completion and drop-out rates are the ways to identify the gender inequality in education. Pakistan aims to achieve Millennium Development Goals and also aims to eliminate gender disparity at all levels of education by the year 2015.United Nations, UNDP. http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/. Elimination of gender disparity at all levels of education requires higher allocation of resources on women's education. Strong gender disparities exist in literacy and educational attainment between rural and urban areas of Pakistan. Socio-economic hurdles Patriarchal values are deeply embedded in the society of Pakistan, and its different manifestations are observed in different aspects of the society. As mentioned above, gender division of labour enforces women to primarily specialize in unpaid care work as mothers and wives at home, whereas men perform paid work, and come out as breadwinners. This has led to a low level of resource investment in girls' education not only by their families but also by the state. This low investment in women's human capital, compounded by negative social biases and cultural practices, restrictions on women's mobility and the internalization of patriarchy by women themselves, becomes the basis for gender discrimination and disparities in most spheres of life. Some of the ramifications are that women are unable to develop job- market skills, hence, they have limited opportunities available to them in the wage-labour market. Moreover, social and cultural restrictions limit women's chances to compete for resources in a world outside the four walls of their homes. It translates into social and economic dependency of women on men. The nature and degree of women's oppression and subordination vary across classes, regions and the rural and urban divide in Pakistan. It has been observed that male dominant structures are relatively more marked in the rural and tribal setting where local customs and indigenous laws establish stronger male authority and power over women.Khan, S (2007). \\"Gender Issues in higher education in Pakistan\\". Bulletin, Issue 162, 2007. Insurgency hurdles Destruction of schools and killings have harmed women's education in Pakistan. 16-year-old education activist and blogger Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head and neck by Taliban insurgents 9 October 2012 after she had blogged about the destruction of schools and closing of all-girls schools in her town of Mingora in the Swat District. Later, the Taliban denied that it opposes education and claimed \\"Malala was targeted because of her pioneer role in preaching secularism and so-called enlightened moderation.\\" In September 2012 the Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported that 710 schools have been destroyed or damaged by militants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 401 schools have been destroyed or damaged in Swat.Militancy keeps 600,000 KP children out of school 12 September 2012 While the Taliban's campaign extends beyond girls to secular education in general, at least one source reports the damage was related to Taliban opposition to girls' education.Why the Taliban Shot the Schoolgirl Leon Wieseltier October 19, 2012  accessed 12.11.212 Another source includes the bombing of girls' schools as among the Taliban policies.  Barriers to a Higher Education  Although education for women in Pakistan is a right since 1976 there is still a sizable gender gap, specifically in higher education for women. From data collected in 2003-2004 enrollment of women in bachelor's degree programs was 43.5% as compared to their male counterparts who had an enrollment of 56.49%. Furthermore, in a study by Monazza Aslam it was concluded that an investment in women's education has a higher economic return than that of male education, and yet there is little importance put on women's education. This is due to the societal expectations and the value of women in Pakistan. The path to a higher education for women is rigorous and doesn't yield the same results as that of a man. Firstly, women are viewed as housewives and mothers, they are set aside for one purpose – making their education the least important concern for their families. Additionally, the decision to obtain an education is not up to women in Pakistan, their families whether it be their parents or their spouse get to decide the fate of their women. Since women are groomed for marriage their families are often concerned with teaching them household chores so that they can please their spouses and new families. If a daughter is given the opportunity to a higher education her family is often using it as a 'golden bracelet.' A higher education can be seen as high status and often showcases a families wealth, specifically to incentivize potential suitors. Furthermore, a man's education is valued above a woman's due to the gender norms in Pakistan as well as the non-existent social security. Parents will invest in their sons education and future because they will rely on him in their old age because they will eventually move in with him. Another issue for higher education for women is the financial aspect, already since the ultimate goal for a family is to get their daughter married they are focusing on obtaining money for a dowry, then before a women's education the education of their son is more important, and lastly higher education in general is very expensive which is a major barrier for some families. Lastly, another major issue for women are the lack of all women and coed schools, this limits many women in obtaining a higher education. Obtaining a higher education is not an easy path. If a woman is married she is still expected to take care of her family and many women in Pakistan are not allowed to work outside of their homes, making it very difficult to get a job. Furthermore, even after jumping over all the obstacles once a women obtains a higher education she has to deal with the gender discrimination in the workplace, and many women will find that it is not easy to find well paid or managerial jobs even with a college degree. Rural vs. urban In year 2006, the literacy rate in urban areas was recorded as 58.3% while in rural areas it was 28.3%, and only 12% among rural women.Federal Bureau of Statistics/Ministry of Education, Pakistan. An interesting factor in this context is that female enrollment was recorded highest at the primary level, but it progressively decreases at the secondary, college and tertiary levels. It was estimated that less than 3% of the 17–23 age group of girls have access to higher education.Pakistan Education Statistics (Summary) 2005-06, Government of Pakistan. The number of women who attend school in urban areas vs. rural areas differs drastically. In urban areas, women's education is increasing every day. The parents of girls who live in urban areas are a lot more accepting of their enrolling in school and even encourage girls to pursue a career as they are also a lot more knowledgeable of their rights. This makes them a lot more motivated to stand up for their education. Parent in urban areas are a lot more modernized or westernized. These urban parents acknowledge the importance of an education. Women who live in urban areas are often enrolled in private schools getting a better education there as they have a lot more educational accessibility. Women in urban areas are also surrounded by people who are educated and are not put down or beaten for going to school. Unlike in urban areas, women in rural areas are discouraged to attend school. Most of them are brought up in conservative families with little to no education. They have to work harder than women in urban areas because they have little support system. If their parents are accepting of education they still cannot go since most of them are very poor and cannot afford the expense. The women also do not attend school in rural areas of Pakistan because it is not culturally accepted. The perspective of rural Pakistani parents about education continues to change. Many parents acknowledge the real benefits of obtaining a higher education: women’s control and empowerment. In contrast, some parents still view education as a way to attract a better marriage.Ali, R., Jumani, N.B, & Ejaz, S. (2015). Higher education of women in Pakistan: Promises, achievements, and barriers. Pakistan Journal of Women's Studies, 22(2), 59 These conservative families tend to be more traditional expecting women to stay at home and attend the house while men go out to work. They're also restricted in rural areas because their town may not even have a school, therefore having to travel a long distance to attend one. ==Statistics== The latest official statistics on enrollment that are provided by the Ministry of Education of Pakistan are of year 2005–2006. The statistics can be divided into two categories, public schools and private schools. Pre-primary ;Public sector According to the government of Pakistan, total enrollment level of pre-primary in public sector was 4,391,144. Out of 4,391,144 pre-primary students, 2,440,838 are boys, and 1,950,306 are girls. It shows that 56% of enrolled students are boys, and 44% are girls. Further breakdown of these statistics into urban and rural enrollment levels reveals almost similar percentage of enrollment among boys and girls, i.e. in rural schools 57% are boys and 43% are girls. Private sector; There is a huge sector of private education in Pakistan. According to the government of Pakistan, 2,744,303 pre-primary students are enrolled in private schools. Among them, 1,508,643 are boys, and 1,235,660 are girls. It shows that 55% of enrolled kids are boys and 45% are girls. Of the total number, 39% students are in rural areas, and the percentage of enrolled boys and girls in rural areas are 58% and 42% respectively. Primary education Primary education is compulsory for every child in Pakistan, but due to culture, poverty, and child labour, Pakistan has been unable to achieve 100% enrollment at the primary level. ;Public sector The total enrollment in primary public sector is 11,840,719; 57% (6,776,536) are boys, and 43% (5,064,183) are girls. 79% of all the primary students in Pakistan are enrolled in rural schools, and the gender enrollment ratios are 59% and 41% for boys and girls respectively in rural Pakistan. ;Private sector The private schools are mostly located in urban centers, and the total enrollment in private primary schools was 4,993,698. Middle school level The enrollment level falls dramatically from primary to middle school level in Pakistan. These statistics can be very helpful in comprehending the problems faced by Pakistan in its educational sector. ;Public sector 3,642,693 students are enrolled in public middle schools; 61% (2,217,851) are boys, and 39% (1,424,842) are girls. Of the total enrollment, 62% students are in rural areas, and the enrollment of girls are much lower in rural middle schools vis- à-vis urban schools. In rural schools, 66% enrolled students are boys and 34% are girls. ;Private sector The enrollment in private schools declines sharply after primary level, as the cost of attendance in private schools increases and the majority of the population cannot afford private education in Pakistan. The total number of students enrolled in private schools at middle level is 1,619,630. Of the total level of enrollment in private schools, 66% students are in urban schools. Hence, the ratio of boys and girls is relatively balanced with 54% boys and 46% girls. High school level In Pakistan grades 8 to 10 constitute high school education. ;Public sector The total number of students enrolled in public high schools is 1,500,749. The 61% of students are boys and 39% are girls. Overall enrollment decreases sharply at high school level. A very disproportionate gender ratio is observed in rural high schools, only 28% of the enrolled students are girls, and 72% are boys. ;Private sector 632,259 students are enrolled in private high schools. Most of them are in urban centers. The ratio of boys and girls enrollment is 53% and 47% respectively. Higher secondary The overall ratio seems to equalize among boys and girls in higher secondary education. ;Public sector There are 699,463 students enrolled in higher secondary education in public institutions. There is almost 50% boys and girls enrollment in higher secondary education. But there is a discrepancy between urban and rural enrollments. Only 16% of the students from the total number are from rural areas, and only 28% are female students. While in urban centers, 55% students are female students. ;Private sector 154,072 students are enrolled in private higher secondary institutions, with 51% boys and 49% girls. Degree level education Female students outnumber their male counterparts in degree level education. ;Public sector There are only 296,832 students enrolled in degree level education in public sector institutions, and 62% of them are female while 38% are male. Very few (less than 1%) students are in rural institutions. ;Private sector 29,161 students are enrolled in private sector institutions; 4% are female, mostly in urban city centers. Summary of statistics These statistics shed some interesting facts about education in Pakistan; the gender disparity in education is much lower in urban places vis- à-vis rural areas. One of the possible explanations of this pattern is relatively stronger dominance of tribal, feudal and patriarchal traditions in rural areas. Moreover, there are very few employment opportunities for women in rural areas, and thus, there is very little financial incentive for families to send their girls to schools. However, despite the meagre representation of females in the education sector, the level of achievement of female students is consistently far higher than that of their counterpart male students. Girls generally outclass boys in examination, and they are also higher achievers in universities. Unfortunately, the majority of the girls never get an opportunity to develop their educational capabilities. ==All- female madrassas== There are almost 2,000 registered Islamic religious schools for girls, educating almost a quarter of a million young women and providing more than half of the candidates sitting graduate-level exams every year. ==Role of government in women's education== Officially the government of Pakistan is committed to provide every citizen an access to education, but critics say that its budget allocation towards education does not correspond with its former commitment. The expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP was 1.82% in 2000–2001, while it has been raised slightly in 2006–2007 to 2.42%, and it is still relatively lower than most neighboring countries. Feminist economists argue that the government of Pakistan needs to fully address and resolve the gender concerns that exist in the educational sector. They suggest that one of the ways to improve this situation is by increasing funding for women's education, encourage and financially incentivize people in the rural areas to send their girls to schools. In the apprentice of gender studies, the gender division of labor is considered patriarchal, and feminists argue that it can be consciously neutralized by the public policies, i.e. encouraging girls to study mathematics, science, computers, and business administration etc. This way, girls will specialize in higher paying fields (jobs) instead of solely focusing on care work. ==Role of parents== In 2016, parents seized the initiative by sending their daughters to what has become a co-education school in Mangar Kota, Swat. The village has only one primary school for girls, with just one teacher. The nearest secondary school is 12 kilometres away. The only way for girls to continue their education was to attend a boys school. Inspired by Malala Yousafzai the parents of 8 girls have enrolled their daughters in a boys school.Dawn 6 June 2016 Parents are often reluctant to send their daughter's to school due to distance, poor infrastructure, safety and security concerns, and lack of facilities such as bathrooms in schools. This is a particular concern in rural areas where there is low provision of schools for females. A mother’s education is an important factor that influences their children's opportunities and education attainment. This can also be considered a barrier for new generations, continuing the cycle of women not achieving a higher education. A Pakistan’s girl school attainment increases by one-third to one-half more per one year of the formal mother’s education. Approximately half of the population in Pakistan are women; a country would not be able to advance if half of its citizens are limited to higher education. ==Conclusion== Statistics show that education in Pakistan can be characterized by extensive gender inequalities. Girls/women have to face socio-cultural hurdles to acquire education. International community has developed a consensus through the Millennium Development Goals to eliminate gender inequality from education.Millennium Development Goals, UNDP, http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/education.shtml. The proponents of gender equality argue that it is not only humane and ethical thing to provide everyone easy access to education without any gender bias, but it is also essential for development and progress of a society that both men and women are educated. They also point towards empirical studies that have confirmed that gender inequality in education has significant impact on rural poverty in Pakistan, and female literacy is important for poverty alleviation. Feminists like Martha Nussbaum are arguing that there is an immediate need to increase the public expenditures on female education in order to achieve gender equality at all levels. ==See also== * Women in Pakistan * Women's rights * Government College of Women * Government Degree Girls College ==References== Category:Education in Pakistan Category:Women in Pakistan Pakistan Category:Statistics of education ","title":"Women's education in Pakistan"},{"id":"35296650","text":" HMS Flying Fish was the American-built schooner Flying Fish, launched in 1801.Footner (1998), p.72.

Tiny bulbils form in the leaf joints in the upper part of the plant, giving the plant its scientific and common names. Cicuta bulbifera can be distinguished from Cicuta douglasii by its narrow leaflet segments (less than 1/4 of an inch wide) and its bulbil-bearing upper leaf axils. ==Morphology== This native perennial plant reaches tall with limited branching. The stems are light green to slightly reddish, glabrous, and glaucous from epicuticular wax. The compound, alternate leaves are green, also glaucous (excluding petioles), and up to , becoming smaller as they ascend the stems. Lower leaves are bipinnate, while the upper leaves are often simple-pinnate. The petioles of the lower leaves are long, but those of the shorter leaves are much shorter or even absent. Leaflets (pinnae) are up to long and across; they are linear to lanceolate-linear, dentate, and sometimes cleft into narrow lobes. The axils of the upper leaves often have sessile clusters of ovoid bulbils, capable of giving rise to new plants. The root system consists of a cluster of elongated fleshy roots. The stems terminate into compound umbels of small white flowers, each of which spans about across and comprises about 8 umbellets, themselves each composed of some 16 flowers. The entire inflorescence is bractless, although a small sessile leaf may occur near the base of it. Flowers are about across and consist of 5 white petals, 5 stamens, 2 styles, and an ovary. The blooming period occurs during late summer to early fall and lasts about a month. There is no noticeable floral scent. Each seed is contained in a fruit of the same size as the original flower that is somewhat flattened, egg- shaped, and slightly notched at its apex. ==Distribution, habitat and ecology== Native distribution Cicuta bulbifera is native to North America and has a wide range of distribution from Newfoundland and Labrador to British Columbia in Canada, to Virginia, Indiana, Nebraska and Oregon in the United States. A perennial, it reproduces by its seeds and bulbils. It grows along the edges of marshes and lake margins, in bogs, wet meadows, shallow standing water and along slow-moving streams. It can also grow on hummocks and floating mats, on partially submerged rotting logs, and is even known to grow on beaver dams. This species is normally found in high-quality wetlands. ==Toxicity== All plant parts are highly poisonous to humans and livestock. The tuberous roots, stem base, and young shoots are especially toxic. Livestock poisoning from Water Hemlocks is the most common in dry areas of the western United States, where grazing animals are drawn to low areas for green forage during dry spells. The poisonous properties of C. bulbifera are similar to those of other members of the genus Cicuta. The roots and rootstalks are the most poisonous parts of the plant, but apparently all parts of the plant may contain some of the poison, especially in the early stages of growth. Ingestion of a small portion of the root is enough to kill an adult. Some would list these plants as the most poisonous naturally occurring North American genus of leafy plants. Poisoning Poisoning from these plants has been reported a number of times in human beings. Children and adults have consumed the roots mistaking them for parsnips or other roots, often with fatal results. Most cases of poisoning however occur in early spring. The quantity of C. bulbifera necessary to cause death varies with the season and age of the plant. A piece of root about the size of a walnut is enough to cause the death of a cow. Symptoms The symptoms of poisoning by C. bulbifera in human beings include pain in the stomach, nausea, violent vomiting, diarrhea, dilated pupils, labored breathing, foaming at the mouth and rapid convulsions. In animals the first symptom is generally frothing at the mouth followed by uneasiness and pain, succeeded by violent intermittent convulsions in which the animal kicks while throwing its head back. Treatment Some suggested treatment is to give an efficient emetic, followed by a cathartic. If free vomiting is promptly produced, the patient is likely to recover. For cattle, injections of morphine have been recommended to treat convulsions and pain, but the convulsions are often uncontrollable. ==References== Category:Apioideae Category:Flora of Canada Category:Poisonous plants Category:Flora of the United States Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Cicuta bulbifera"},{"id":"35296660","text":"The American Society for Reproductive Immunology, or ASRI, is a US-based organization of scientists from around the world interested in reproductive immunology.

The Temple of San Sebastiano is a late-Renaissance- or Mannerist-style church in central Milan. The cylindrical church is shaped like a can capped with a dome. The octagonal church was commissioned in 1576, after the end of a season of plague, dedicated to St Sebastian. The non-linear layout is atypical for post-Tridentine churches. Perhaps the site, which had housed an earlier medieval church or sanctuary dedicated to San Quilino, dictated the shape. Some evidence suggests that the architect Pellegrino Tibaldi designed the building with other round churches or the Pantheon as models. He did not spare the mannerist details such as false windows on the top story, and highly decorated spandrels. The church construction was advanced in 1586, when Tibaldi left for Spain, and supervision of the project fell to Pietro Antonio Barca, who modified the height and size of the dome. In 1616-1617, under Fabio Mangone further reconstruction occurred with addition of a chancel to the main chapel. The cupola was decorated in 1832 by Agostino Comerio. The building has been used both as a church and civic chapel. Some rooms in the vestry are used to screen films. ==See also== * History of early modern period domes ==Sources== *Lombardy Beniculturali entry Category:Roman Catholic churches in Milan Category:16th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1617 Category:Renaissance architecture in Milan Category:Octagonal churches in Italy Category:1617 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Tourist attractions in Milan ","title":"San Sebastiano, Milan"},{"id":"35296882","text":"Midway is an unincorporated community in Woodbury County, Iowa, United States.

Arts Tasmania is within the Tasmanian Department of State Growth. It is the Tasmanian Government agency responsible for policy and planning for arts and culture in Tasmania. The Minister for The Arts is Elise Archer MP and the Director is Dr David Sudmalis. ==Background== The Tasmanian Arts Advisory Board (TAAB) was established to provide advice on policy and funding to the state government and was created by the Tasmanian Arts Advisory Board Act (1975) Arts Tasmania was created in 1991 as an umbrella term used by the Tasmanian State Government when referring to the Tasmanian Arts Advisory Board (TAAB), and the then Office of the Arts within the then Department of Education and the Arts.In 1990, a report commissioned for the Minister for Education and the Arts recommended that an, ‘Office of the Arts’ should be created within the Department of Education, as a way ‘to continue to assist the TAAB but also to assist the Deputy Secretary of the Department in maintaining integrated policy for arts and culture in Tasmania.’ (Final Report, Review of the Department of Education and the Arts, Tasmania, CRESAP: A Towers Perrin Co., 14 September 1990, pp131.) The TAAB endorsed the findings of this report at its 109th meeting (Minutes, TAAB’s 109th meeting, 12 December 1990, pp2) however in June 1991, a new identity ‘Arts Tasmania’ was conceived and used as an umbrella for the State arts funding and policy development, and that the ‘Office of the Arts’ and the ‘Tasmanian Arts Advisory Board’ have independent status. (Minutes, Item 4.1, Tasmanian Arts Advisory Board meeting number 113, 12 June 1991, Pp2) The name, ‘Arts Tasmania’ was publicly launched, along with a newsletter and brochure of the same name, on 18 December 1991 by the Minister for the Arts. (Minutes, TAAB’s 116th meeting, Item 5.3, 10 December 1991, pp4) The title, ‘Office of the Arts’ only lasted until late 1992, upon which ‘Arts Tasmania’ was used thereafter.

At the 2016 Census the population of the state suburb of Maxwelton was 22. == Geography == The town of Maxwelton is located on the Flinders Highway 1,625 kilometres from Brisbane by road. The Great Northern railway from Townsville to Mount Isa passes through the town. Maxwelton railway siding () serves the town, while Gemoka railway siding () serves the rural areas to the east of the town. The name Gemoka was assigned by the Queensland Railways Department on18 September 1925 and is an Aboriginal word meaning cattle camp. ==History== Maxwelton was a small railway siding, west of Richmond. It derived its name from Maxwelton Station, one of the original pastoral holdings taken up in the 1800s. This station is just south of the rail siding. The site for the township was chosen in 1908, at the junction of the new railway line and the road from McKinlay to the Camp Hotel on the Flinders River. The first sod was turned to begin work on this Great Northern Railway in Townsville in 1879, and by February 1908 it had reached Julia Creek. Before the railway, bullock teams carted wool from Cloncurry to the East Coast, and Cobb and Co stage coaches travelled through with mail in 1871. Several hotels were being built along the Flinders River route, all of which are now in ruins and only recognisable by old stumps or an occasional post here and there. Pastoral holdings were then much larger and in this area, they included Tarbrax, Maxwelton, Clutha and Saxby.From Wyangarie to Richmond A Historic record of the Richmond District of North West Queensland. Compiled by Julie ann Authurs. 1995 Richmond Shire Council . Page 181-186 Maxwelton Post Office opened by February 1910 (a receiving office had been open for various periods since 1880) and closed in 1991.leftMaxwelton Provisional School opened on 15 November 1923, becoming Maxwelton State School on 23 April 1925. It closed in 1926 but reopened in July 1927. It closed permanently in 1989. Before the artesian bore was put down in 1929 to a depth of , water was carted from the bore at the Talmoi Wool Scour, a couple of miles east of Maxwelton. Maxwelton is situated on a low flood plain and its biggest flood on record was in 1917. Waters back up for miles, from the Flinders and Alick Creek. A bridge was completed in 1926 called Hulberts Bridge. The Camp Hotel was known locally as the \\"one-eye\\" after one of its owners who had one eye, a one eyed horse and a one eyed dog. In days gone by, the little township has boasted a café, butchers shop, a dance hall, a pub, a post office and a school. In 1960 the town itself had a population of 72 and the one-teacher school had 17 students from grade 1 to grade 8. The teachers (who boarded at the hotel) at that time were Harry Thomas followed by Henry Crowther (arguably one of the best of outback teachers). Art and dress-making were taught by Mrs Edith Pick (wife of the Postal Clerk) who was also instrumental in organising the annual Maxwelton Gymkhana (Maxwelton Races). The hotel was owned by Mrs Dawson (who had one eye) and was often visited by Cecil Hickmott and his horse 'Dick'. Dick was well known for drinking in the bar and putting on a drunken walk home over the railway line. Apart from the hotel, school, railway station and post office, the only other public building in town was the public shower. Built of corrugated iron next to the bore head and sporting the best shower rose in Australia it was fed by hot water direct from the untapped artesian bore. Also in 1960 the swimming pool was built by locals led by Les Pick (Postal Clerk) and Gilbert Skennerton (Rail Ganger). It was nothing more than an earthen dam with a sand base (trucked from the Flinders River near Hulberts Bridge) but it was a magnet for everyone in town as it was no longer necessary to drive out to the river to cool down in summer. Railway crossing at Maxwelton, 2019 The main occupants of the town were rail workers who had a row of fettlers cottages along the southern side of the rail track which carried two trains a day - The 44 up to Mt Isa and the 19 down to Townsville (The 44 UP and the 19 DOWN). These trains brought in most supplies. With the road trip to Richmond taking up to one and a half hours each way, the shopping trip to Weekly's store in Richmond was a full day outing. The original Post Office began as a receiving office in 1880. It closed and opened many times firstly in 1885, reopening in 1891 and closing again in 1895. It was again reopened in 1907 when the Chatfield Creek receiving office some twelve miles away closed. It was elevated to a Post Office at the Railway Station in February 1910. It was made official in 1915 then unofficial on 1 September 1970. The Post Office was moved to its later position in 1928. Telecommunications shed, 2019 In 1970 the Post Office was run in conjunction with Telecom as one of the last manual exchanges in Australia. It was at this time reduced to a Post Office Agency. 6 April 1990 saw the Post Office Agency cease and a Community Mail Bag was put into operation. Former Maxwelton State School, 2019 The Maxwelton School was closed due to lack of children, but has had as many as 35 pupils enrolled in the past. The school first began in the old butchers shop in 1923, and the teacher was given board and lodging at the North Star Hotel for one pound per week. The first official school building was built on five acres of land south of the railway line in 1925 where it still stands today. For the last 61 years the annual Maxwelton races have occurred at the town's racecourse on the southern side of the Flinders Highway. The future of the race is currently in doubt, but there has been a recent revival in public interest.Lisa Kingsberry & Julia Harris (10 June 2011). The last Maxwelton?

It can also grow in areas of swamp. Supplejack is a climbing liana, that has hard but flexible stems. It starts its life as a sappy stem searching for a support. Once it finds a shrub or tree to cling onto, it grows upwards to access sunlight, where it then develops branches and leaves. The supplejack flowers from December to February. It however bears clusters of red berries throughout the year. During summer supplejack tips grow 5 centimetres a day, enabling the plant to climb high up into the canopy of the forest. ==Taxonomy== In 1769, during explorer Lieutenant James Cook's first voyage of discovery, botanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander collected specimens of \\"supplejack\\" (Ripogonum scandens) in New Zealand. The species was described in Solander's unpublished manuscript Primitiae Florae Novae Zelandiae and was illustrated by Sydney Parkinson. Cook again visited New Zealand in 1773 during his second voyage. While anchored at Dusky Bay (now Dusky Sound) in the South Island of New Zealand, he remarked in his journal: During this voyage naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster, assisted by his son Georg Forster collected plant specimens, the elder Forster offering the following description in his journal: In 1776, the Fosters published the genus Ripogonum in the second edition of their Characteres Generum Plantarum with Ripogonum scandens as the type species. == Species description == The Supplejack vine is an evergreen (a plant, bush or tree that retains it leaves for the duration of the year), indigenous climbing vine. It climbs by coiling its stems around tree trunks and branches. When there are no supporting trees for the vines to climb up, the vines create a tangled mess on the forest floor, creating a dense knotted entanglement. In the first few years of establishment, the SuppleJack mirrors a small shrub, but in its later seasons the stems start to spiral around the supporting trees. In summer, when the conditions are right, the tips of the vines can grow up to 5 centimetres per day, giving ample opportunity for the vines to climb high into the canopy, suffocating trees in the fight for light. When the vines/ stems reach the sunlight at the top of the canopy, they begin to produce green leafy stems opposed to the brown woody stems; which begin to produce flowers and fruit. Flowering takes place during October till May granted the stem is in full light at the top of the canopy. Fruiting takes place throughout the year and the Supplejack will produce small (1 cm diameter) red berries. The leaves are opposite, ovate and shiny. Male and female flowers are separate, female flowers produce the larger berries. ==Traditional Māori uses== Traditionally supplejack was used by Māori to bind and pull objects. For example, the vine was used to tie firewood together and for towing small canoes. Medicinally the supplejack root was boiled to make a drink to help a variety of conditions including rheumatism, fever, disability, bowel problems and skin diseases. The soft, fresh shoots of the vine can also be eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable. == Geographic distribution and habitat ==  Natural global range  New Zealand.  New Zealand range  Found in the North and South islands of New Zealand as well as a few offshore islands including Stewart and Chatham Islands. R. scandens is mainly present is lowland and mountainous forests dominated by hardwood and podocarp throughout the North island. Ripogonum scandens is not found on the Three Kings Islands and on the Poor knights Islands. It occurs infrequently in the Hawke’s Bay only in old coastal forests. It is found at altitudes in the North Island of up to 900m in the Kapamahunga range. In the South Island of New Zealand Ripogonum scandens does not tend to seep into the forests, instead staying on the seaward facing ranges. Throughout Marlborough, Canterbury and Otago the occurrence of R. scandens is found sparingly in relics of old forests and mainly found on peninsulas such as Kaikoura, Banks and Otago. The supplejack vine is abundant on the western coast of the South Island.  Habitat preferences  Ripogonum scandens will inhabit a wide range of soil types such as red-brown loams, pumice, yellow brown and alluvial. It has also been known to be able to withstand swampy forests where the soil may be flooded periodically throughout the year and hooping of the roots above ground was observed in such soil conditions. Due to the climbing nature to the Supplejack they require strong branches and trucks to be able to climb up or else they remain a matted shrub on the forest floor. == Phenology == Shoots of differing lengths can be seen at all times during the year however they are most common during the springtime where the sun becomes stronger and they are able to photosynthesize more. Anthers become visible in December and through January. Once the anthers have been pollinated by either an insect or by wild pollination (wind dispersal/ browsing/ seed dispersal), the fruit takes approximately 12–15 months to fully ripen; the berries can be seen all year round. The seed germinates easily only if it doesn’t dry out. == Pathogens / predators == Supplejack is very vulnerable to different types of birds and mammals that are known to eat the fruit and roots of supplejack. Kereru (Hemiphaga novae-seelandiae) and blackbirds (Turdus merula) are two main birds that consume supplejack fruit. Kaka have also been known to have eaten supplejack berries. They fall victim to being over-consumed and being browsed too much leaving them stripped bare of either their leaves or a lot of their fruit. Over the years as the number of invasive species increase throughout New Zealand, this has started putting pressure on the plants survival rate and is now causing a decrease in how often the plant is occurring. A new climber specie related to supplejack called Geitonoplesium cymosum has somehow been brought over to New Zealand. This specie is very similar to the native supplejack but there is a threat that if this new specie continues to thrive and spread throughout New Zealand that it could out-compete supplejack. Wild pigs also have a negative impact on juvenile supplejack as they forage through the forest floor. While they are disturbing and consuming other plants, they are also uprooting growing supplejack. Deer and cattle also have the same negative impact on supplejack. These mammals graze on the seedlings and growing juvenile plants. Possums are another mammal in the New Zealand forests that eat the flesh of the supplejack fruit. There is also a type of fungal specie that grows and covers supplejacks stems and leaves. This fungus is described as a sooty mould and is called Trichopeltheca asiatica. This fungus is common across New Zealand and since it tends to ‘smother’ the supplejack, this can greatly affect the plants ability to photosynthesize. There are also some various species of moths from the order Lepidoptera that are found throughout New Zealand. One example is Ctenopseustis obliquana. Its larvae can be found in ripe fruit and it will also consume the stems, leaves and flowers of the supplejack. ==References== scandens Category:Flora of New Zealand ","title":"Ripogonum scandens"},{"id":"35296968","text":"Thomas-Louis Bourgeois (Fontaine-l'Évêque, Hainaut, Belgium 24 October 1676 - Paris, January 1750 or 1751) was a Walloon composer and haute-contre.

Cushioned rail cars based on his design are still the standard. ==Career== MacCurdy joined SRI International in 1952 with a background in shipbuilding; he was previously a naval architect. Donald J. Russell connected Southern Pacific with SRI in 1954, and asked them to design a new rail coupling; in particular, Southern Pacific was concerned with the draft gear, the part that connects the couplings to the rolling stock. In MacCurdy's design, the coupler has an extended connection to the center of the railway car, combined with interleaved fingers at each end of the railway car helping to absorb some of the effects of acceleration. The theory was tested in December 1954 by modifying an existing car with the technology (initially known as the \\"Hydra- friction\\") in Sacramento and placing it into relatively difficult service; the car greatly exceeded expectations. The second iteration, bearing the more widely known name of Hydra-Cushion, was introduced in April 1956, and Southern Pacific built and deployed an additional 350 of these cars in summer 1957. The average damage to freight was reduced to 1/25th of previous values. MacCurdy left SRI to be the chief research engineer in the Transportation Equipment Division of Evans Products Company, which was licensed some of the proprietary information about the Hydra-Cushion from Southern Pacific in 1957. ==Legacy== In 1964, MacCurdy and Southern Pacific's William E.

It was the most successful film of that year. In total, the film sold an estimated 140million tickets at the Soviet box office, making it the highest-grossing Soviet film of all time. German film director and screenwriter Rainer Werner Fassbinder included The Red Snowball Tree in the top ten of his favorite films.Jim’s Reviews — The Films of Rainer Werner Fassbinder ==Plot== Yegor Prokudin (Vasili Shukshin), a recidivist thief nicknamed Gorye (Grief), completes his prison sentence and moves to a village to meet his pen pal Lyuba (Lidiya Fedoseyeva-Shukshina) who lives there. She is a stranger that wrote to him while he was in prison. At first, Yegor plans to lay low for a while before returning to crime. Lyuba appears to genuinely love him, despite his criminal past and skepticism from her own friends and hostility from parents. Yegor goes to town where he spends a lot of money drinking and dancing with strangers, and wires some money to his former associate. While he is away, Lyuba's friends try to convince her to get back together with her ex-husband, thinking that Yegor may start stealing again. Yegor returns and settles in a village with Lyuba, and decides to break with the criminal past. The villagers get over their initial distrust of the ex- convict, and accept him into their community. He drives with Lyuba to another village and asks her to impersonate a social worker to speak to an elderly woman living there. She talks about her tough life and says she has not seen her son for 18 years, while Yegor sits in another room wearing sunglasses. After the visit, Yegor tearfully admits it was his mother. Lyuba's ex-husband and his friend visit Yegor and start a fight, but they retreat after seeing Yegor has no fear of them. Yegor starts a new job as a tractor driver in the field and enjoys being close to nature. Yegor's former associate arrives to the village, asking him to return to town and giving him some money for travel expenses. Yegor throws the money in his face. Shortly after that, five criminals arrive to the village, shoot Yegor and escape. Yegor dies in Lyuba's hands, while her brother Pyotr (Aleksei Vanin) chases them with his dump truck, crushing them and pushing their car into the river. ==Name== The name of the film refers to the snowball tree, otherwise known as the guelder-rose, a type of viburnum. ==Production== The director has long nurtured plans to shoot a picture about Stepan Razin, but the State Committee for Cinematography put forward a condition to Shukshin - before he begins to work on a historical drama he must first direct a picture about the present. Shukshin then decided to adapt the story Kalina Krasnaya which he published in the magazine Nash Sovremennik. Filming took place in the city of Belozersk, Vologda Oblast, as well as in the surrounding villages - Sadovaya, Desyatovskaya and Krokhino. Local villagers took part in the episodic roles. In November 1973, when the shooting was completed and Vasily Shukshin was busy with the editing, he suffered a severe attack of the peptic ulcer disease. The director was hospitalized but after staying in the hospital for a few days, he escaped from there and continued work on the film. ==Cast== * Vasili Shukshin as Yegor Prokudin, former burglar * Lidiya Fedoseyeva-Shukshina as Lyuba Baykalova, Yegor's bride * Ivan Ryzhov as Fedor Baykalov, Lyuba's father * Maria Skvortsova as Lyuba's mother'' * Aleksei Vanin as Pyotr Baykalov, Lyuba's brother * Maria Vinogradova as Zoya, Pyotr's wife * Euphemia Bystrova as Yegor's mother * Zhanna Prokhorenko as inquisitor * Lev Durov as Sergey Mikhailovich, ofitsiant * Alexander Gorbenko as Kolya, former Lyuba's husband * Nikolai Grabbe as chief of corrective labor colony * Nikolay Pogodin as diretor of sovkhoz * Georgi Burkov as Guboshlyop, criminal leader * Tatyana Gavrilova as Lusyen, criminal girlfriend * Artur Makarov as Buzya, criminal * Oleg Korchikov as Shurka, criminal * Natalya Gvozdikova as telegraph operator * Iya Arepina as Yegor's sister == Awards== * Polish Film Critics Award Warsaw siren for best foreign film in 1973, shown in Poland * The main prize of the All-Union Film Festival in Baku (1974) \\"For an original, brilliant talent of the writer, director and actor\\" *Readers of the magazine Soviet Screen picked it as best film of the year, and Shukshin as best actor. *Shukshin posthumously received the Lenin Prize in 1976. ==References«За калиной красной» — Журнал «Огонёк», № 10 (5088), 20.07.2009 Category:1974 films Category:1974 drama films Category:Soviet drama films Category:Russian drama films Category:Russian films Category:Soviet films Category:Mosfilm films Category:Films directed by Vasily Shukshin Category:Films based on Russian novels ","title":"The Red Snowball Tree"},{"id":"35297105","text":"Mirognathus normani, Norman's Smooth-head, is a species of slickhead native to the north-east and western Atlantic Ocean.

Built in 1910 by the Portland Railway, Light and Power Company (PRL&P;), it was added to the register in 2002. The structure was associated with Portland's street railway and interurban system of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Employees of PRL&P;'s transit division often worked 365 days a year and were expected to perform a variety of tasks including selling tickets, collecting fares, operating and cleaning streetcars, and writing reports. The clubhouse offered a few amenities for these workers. Although the first floor of the two-story building was used mainly for the trainmaster's office, a lost-and-found department, and record storage, it also included three shower-baths and a toilet. On the second floor were billiard tables, a gin rummy table, emergency sleeping rooms, and a reading room with books, desks, and writing materials. The furnace was in the basement, which also contained a toilet and a set of safe deposit boxes. ==History== The Sellwood Division clubhouse, carbarns, and power plant were part of Portland's interurban and city trolley system. After this system was expanded in 1889 from downtown Portland across the Willamette River on the Steel Bridge to Albina, it was gradually extended south along the east bank of the river. It reached Sellwood in 1892 and Oregon City in 1893. Sellwood, originally an independent city, became part of Portland in 1893. As population increased on the east bank, the line's ridership rose, peaking around 1915 when the Sellwood Division maintained 110 city cars and 30 interurban cars. By 1926, these numbers had dropped to 70 and 22, as economic conditions and commuter habits changed in the age of the automobile and bus. The trainmen's clubhouse closed in 1938; the last trolley ran in 1958. Although similar complexes were built for the Ankeny, Piedmont, and Savier divisions of the street railway system, the Sellwood Division buildings and one building of the former Ankeny carbarn complex are the only surviving remnants of the eight carbarns that once served the Portland area's past electric railway system. Oregon Pacific Railroad. In 1939, the United States Forest Service took over the building for use by the Civilian Conservation Corps and bought the clubhouse and the car barns three years later. Through 1984 it used the clubhouse for storage and as a forest pest research center. After vacating the building, the Forest Service used the adjacent property and outbuildings for storage through 1993, selling everything (with a protective historic-resource covenant for the clubhouse) to private owners in 1996. Vacant until 2002, the building was restored, added to the NRHP, and turned into the home of the Dunthorpe Marketing Group. ==See also== * National Register of Historic Places listings in Southeast Portland, Oregon ==References * Category:National Register of Historic Places in Portland, Oregon Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 1910 Category:1910 establishments in Oregon Category:Sellwood, Portland, Oregon Category:Portland Historic Landmarks Category:Railway buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Oregon Category:Transportation buildings and structures in Portland, Oregon ","title":"Portland Railway, Light and Power Sellwood Division Carbarn Office and Clubhouse"},{"id":"35297133","text":"Eliquate is an alternative hip hop band formed in 2009 in Santa Cruz, California. ==History== Eliquate was formed in 2009 by frontman Elliot Wright when a friend introduced him to guitarist Jamie Schnetzler.

The population in Northern Ontario experiences worse outcomes on a number of important health indicators, including higher rates of chronic disease compared to the population in the rest of Ontario (Romanow, 2002). ==Population under consideration== Northern Ontario is over 800,000 square kilometers, covering nearly 90% of the area of Ontario. Its population of close to 800,000 represents only 6% of the total population for the province. This large land area and relatively small population results in a density of approximately one person per square kilometre, compared to 115 persons per square kilometre in Southern Ontario. Northern Ontario's rural population comprises more than 30% of the total Northern population. In Southern Ontario, only 11% of the population lives in rural area. Over 50% of the North's population live in the five biggest cities of Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Timmins, Greater Sudbury, and North Bay. With mining, forestry and tourism as the major local industries, there are peaks and troughs in the economy, and unemployment rates are usually higher than in the remainder of Ontario (MNDM, 2011). The estimated area of Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) 13 is 400,000 square kilometres or approximately 40% of Ontario, with a population of 551,691. In LHIN 13, 17% of the population is 65 years of age or older, which is significantly higher than the provincial average of 14%. LHIN 13 is diverse with 24% of the population Francophone and 10% of the population First Nations (North East LHIN, 2009). The estimated area of LHIN 14 is 470,000 square kilometers or approximately 47% of Ontario, with a population of 234,599. In LHIN 14, 14.3% of the population is 65 years of age or older. LHIN 14 is diverse with 3.5% of the population Francophone and 19.8% First Nations (North West LHIN, 2009). ==Scope of the health problem== According to the World Health Organization, chronic diseases are defined as diseases of long duration which generally show slow progression (WHO, 2012a). Examples of chronic diseases are cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, stroke, cancer, and diabetes. The main risk factors associated with chronic diseases are tobacco and alcohol use, physical inactivity and unhealthy diets (WHO, 2011). Almost 80% of Ontarians over the age of 45 have a chronic condition, and treatment for these diseases amount to 55% of Ontario's total health costs (MOHLTC, 2007). In Northern Ontario the rates of chronic diseases are higher than the average provincial rates (MOHLTC, 2011). ==Current environment surrounding the problem== In rural and Northern Ontario, life expectancy is less than the provincial average; disability rates are higher in smaller communities; rates for accidents, poisoning and violence are also higher in smaller communities; and people living in remote northern communities are the least healthy and have the lowest life and disability-free life expectancies (North East LHIN, 2009; North West LHIN, 2009). On average, Northern communities have a higher infant mortality rate than Southern communities, reflecting a lower overall health status (MOHLTC, 2011; Appendix B). The Northern Ontario population suffers from higher rates of a number of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes (North East LHIN, 2009; North West LHIN, 2009). There is a higher proportion of the population that are overweight or obese and a higher proportion of the population that are heavy drinkers and smokers (North East LHIN, 2009; North West LHIN, 2009). ==Interactions and dynamics related to the problem== Analysis of the burden of chronic disease has pointed to the importance of risk factors, such as being overweight, smoking, alcohol, and poor diet. These are indeed potent causes of chronic disease, however considering the causes of chronic disease entails a richer understanding of the determinants of health. There is a need to examine the causes of the causes: the social conditions that give rise to high risk behaviours of chronic diseases. A social determinants lens is crucial when addressing chronic diseases in Northern Ontario (Marmot, 2005). Friday, 13 January 2017 The determinants of health (listed in Appendix A) are defined as the diverse set of factors that affect health and pertain to the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age (WHO, 2012b). The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research estimates that 75% of the health of the population is determined by factors outside of the health care system (Mackie, 2012). The determinants of health (DOH) contribute to and exacerbate the worse health outcomes in the LHIN 13 and 14 population. For example, in Northern Ontario, there are higher rates of unemployment and lower rates of education compared to the rest of Ontario (North East LHIN, 2009; North West LHIN, 2009). Low education and unemployment, which are DOH in themselves, are also obvious risk factors for poverty, which is a very significant DOH. This exemplifies the complexity of the problem, as the DOH can interact and have synergistic effects. Furthermore, problems in access to health services in Northern Ontario quite often stem from distance and shortages of health human resources (Romanow, 2002). On average there is less than one physician per 1,000 people in rural areas, compared to two or more physicians per 1,000 people in larger urban centres (ICES, 2006). Demographic and other factors aggravate this population health problem. Northern Ontario has 106 of the 134 Aboriginal communities in Ontario (MNDM, 2011). The health status of Aboriginal people is overall worse than other Ontarians on most measures, including life expectancy, infant mortality, cardiovascular disease prevalence, diabetes prevalence and suicides (Health Council of Canada, 2005). Aboriginal populations also lag behind in almost all DOH (Health Council of Canada, 2005). For example, social support networks are limited for many Aboriginal people due to the residential school act and its legacy. Many Aboriginal people have been unable to establish effective relationships with families and friends as a result of being taken away at an early age from their communities. The usual social bonds that occur with family members, friends and community members were severely and permanently damaged, leaving this population particularly vulnerable (Health Council of Canada, 2005). ==Existing public policies and corporate strategies== There are numerous policies and strategies that have been implemented to address chronic disease prevention and management in Northern Ontario. The existing policies and strategies range from cardiovascular disease prevention programs (for example Heart Health Ontario) to diabetes education programs (for example the Northern Diabetes Health Network) (MOHLTC, 2011). Although it is good that chronic disease prevention and management is not being neglected in Northern Ontario, there is some concern about the effectiveness and efficiency of all these different initiatives. The Centre for Rural and Northern Health Research reported that although health care organizations and relevant stakeholders were progressing towards implementing chronic disease management strategies, there was limited integration of programs at the community and regional levels. It was reported that there was a lack of communication impacting the coordination of services, to the extent that organizations were operating within separate silos, resulting in a lack of collaboration between the various organizations. There appears to be a similar situation in the North East LHIN (Minore, Hill & Perry, 2009). ==Assessment of options for chronic disease prevention and management== Prevention and management of chronic disease requires a comprehensive set of initiatives. Below will outline a number of options, using the applicable determinants of health as a framework, that can help make a difference in addressing chronic disease in Northern Ontario (LHINs 13 and 14). ;Personal Health Practices and Coping Skills :Personal Health Practices and coping skills refer to those actions by which individuals can prevent diseases and promote self-care. These skills are very important in the prevention and management of chronic disease (PHAC, 2003). ;Patient Self-Management :The North West LHIN's Community Care Access Centre is training patients in self-management using Stanford University's six-week \\"Healthy Change with Chronic Conditions\\" workshop. Through this workshop, 75 to 100 people in LHIN 14 have been trained as master trainers. The trainers have a condition requiring management and have volunteered to support and teach others in their community with the same condition. At the end of the training, patients have gained a greater understanding of their condition and could successfully manage their condition at home. Researchers from Stanford University, through the evaluation of a randomized control trial, showed that participants experienced improved health behaviors and health status (Lorig, Sobel, Ritter, Laurent, & Hobbs, 2001). ;Tele-services :Through telecommunications, a range of tele-services are available to help patients and their families manage chronic conditions. Here are three such services: :i) Telehomecare :Telehomecare involves an electronic 2-way communication between the patient and the care provider, generally a nurse. The communication is usually in the form of audio/video conferencing, using the Internet. In addition to conferencing, medical monitoring equipment can be installed in the patient's home, and readings transmitted electronically to the care provider. Patient satisfaction is high with this type of intervention (Finkelstein, Speedie, & Pottfoff, 2006). :ii) Telehomecare Support For Informal Caregivers :Informal caregiving is unpaid caregiving that is usually provided by relatives, friends or neighbours. Often the informal caregivers suffer from physical, emotional and financial stress, isolation, depression and a perceived lack of support (Hogenbirk, Libroiron-Grenier, Pong & Young, 2005). Several telehealth interventions have been designed to reach out to informal caregivers and reduce their levels of stress, by providing counseling via videophone or providing platforms where caregivers can meet each other online and take part in skills development programs (Buckwalter, David, Wakefield, Kienzle, & Murray, 2002). :iii) Televisitation :The Televisitation Program at Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre facilitates patient and family member communication through a face-to-face, real-time secure video connection during the patient's hospital stay. Televisitation reduces feelings of isolation on the part of the patient, aids in recovery, and prepares the patient's family for caregiving upon discharge (Petersen, 2011). As a result, caregiving is better for the patient and less stressful for the caregivers (K. Shields, personal communication, March 15, 2012). ;Social Support Networks :Support from families, friends and communities is associated with better health and enables people to deal with adversity. These social support networks are significant determinants in effectively managing health problems such as chronic disease (PHAC, 2003). ;Family-Directed Respite Care :Respite care is care that provides a primary, often informal, caregiver temporary relief from caring for an ill individual. In the North West LHIN, the vast distances makes hiring agency respite care very expensive. In 2009, a pilot project using an innovative model of respite care was developed in the District of Thunder Bay in cooperation with the Wesway agency, that maximizes choice, flexibility, cultural sensitivity, family empowerment and cost- effectiveness. The family receives money from the agency, manages the funds, and decides who will provide respite services and for how long. Families were very satisfied with the program. Based on the successful results, the project was extended to 2011 (North West LHIN, 2010). ;Culture and Social Environments :In LHINs 13 and 14, approximately 30% of the population is First Nations. Culture is a significant determinant of health in the Aboriginal population in Northern Ontario. Aboriginals face additional health risks due to their socio- economic environment, which is largely determined by dominant cultural values that contribute to the perpetuation of conditions such as marginalization, stigmatization, loss or devaluation of language and culture and lack of access to culturally appropriate health care and services (PHAC, 2003). Elders play an important role is the Aboriginal community and can contribute to improved health outcomes with chronic disease management in a variety of ways. Working with and empowering Aboriginal leaders to promote health and well-being is a culturally sensitive option to address chronic disease prevention and management (Northern Ontario Medical Journal, 2011). ;Physical Environments :In the built environment, factors related to housing, indoor air quality, and the design of communities can significantly influence chronic disease management. Aboriginal people are more likely to live in over-crowded dwellings compared to the rest of Ontarians and about 30.6% of Aboriginal households are in need of major repairs compared to 8.2% for Ontario (Health Council of Canada, 2005). Reducing harmful impacts from the built environment is a complex undertaking and would have to be done in targeted measurable steps to prove feasible. Smoking cessation programs to reduce the exposure to second-hand smoke in the home and community would be an example of a manageable and cost-effective intervention to better prevent chronic disease in this population. ;Health Services :Health services, particularly those designed to maintain and promote health, to prevent disease, and to restore health and function contribute to population health (PHAC, 2003). Health human resources are an integral part of health services and play a fundamental role in providing care (PHAC, 2003). :Northern Ontario School of Medicine :The Northern Ontario School of Medicine (NOSM) is a joint initiative of Laurentian University, Lakehead University and the Government of Ontario. It focuses on medical education that addresses the unique needs of rural and Northern Ontario so graduates are prepared to work in these areas (NOSM, 2012). Observational studies showed that health professionals from rural and Northern backgrounds are more likely to return to work in rural and Northern communities. Quasi-randomized trials demonstrated that clinical rotations in an underserviced setting increased medical students' likelihood to subsequently work in an underserviced area (WHO, 2009). :Nurse Practitioners :In Ontario, Nurse Practitioners (NPs) are registered nurses with additional education and experience. According to recent statistics, there were approximately 800 primary health care NPs working in Ontario in 2007 (Government of Ontario, 2009). A 1999 Ontario study estimated that NPs are capable of handling 82.6% of patient care, with the remainder requiring physician referral (CNA, 2002). Various research studies and analyses demonstrate that costs for care provided by NPs or NP/physician teams are considerably less than care provided by physicians within office visits or by physician-only teams (Health Canada, 2006). :Physician Assistants :In Canada, physician assistants support physicians in a range of health care settings and work under the direction of a licensed physician to provide patient care. Since 2007, Ontario's Physician Assistant (PA) initiative has been introducing PAs to a number of different health care settings through a series of demonstration projects across the province. Evidence shows that PAs help to improve access to health services and overall quality of care (Government of Ontario, 2010). A systematic review spanning 30 years and examining the use of the physician assistant model of care provision was undertaken by O'Connor and Hooker (2007). The review found that the quality of care was similar to care provided by a physician. Hospitals that had PAs on staff \\"found that they could substitute about 50-75% of a doctor's work with one PA\\" (O'Connor and Hooker, 2007, p. 348). ==ReferencesSources== * Bradley, J.(2012).

Fresco from the Lupanar in Pompeii. North wall, between rooms c and d. Ca. 70-79 AD Priapeia 68 or Priapea 68 is the sixty- eighth poem in the Priapeia, a collection of Latin poetry of uncertain authorship. The eighty poems lack a unified narrative, but share Priapus, an ithyphallic god of fertility worshiped in both Ancient Hellenic and Roman religions, as by turns a speaker and subject. While the Priapeia's author is unknown, Franz Bücheler has claimed that the poems are Augustan in style, and probably were the work of a single writer in the circle of Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, a Roman general and art enthusiast who “like other distinguished men of that age, occupied himself with amusements of this kind.”Connors, Catherine. Petronius the Poet: Verse and Literary Tradition in the Satyricon. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. pp 27. Earlier traditions credited Vergil with the authorship of at least some of the Priapeia. == Summary == Priapeia 68 considers the events of the Iliad and the Odyssey from the point of view of a wooden statue of Priapus, a common sight in Roman gardens as a protector of fruits and a symbol of fertility.Peck, Harry Thurston. Harper's Dictionary of Classical Literature and Antiques. New York: Harper & Brothers,1898. pp. 1311. Referencing: Bücheler, Franz. Petronii Saturae et Liber Priapeorum. Berlin: Apud Weidmannos, 1922. Like most of the other poems in the collection, it features by “a focus on the god’s aggressive, anally-fixated sexuality, by the absence of any discernible religious sentiment, and by the almost invariable treatment of Priapus as a figure of fun.”Price, Simon and Kearns, Emily. The Oxford Dictionary of Classical Myth and Religion. New York: Oxford University Press USA. 2003. pp. 448-449. The servant irreverently posits that sex, and not the great Olympian gods or heroic virtues, was responsible for the events of the Epic Cycle. According to the poem, lust, sexual aggression, and male arousal, themes often associated with Priapus, are the driving forces behind such plot points as the abduction of Helen of Troy, Penelope’s faithfulness, and Odysseus (Ulixes in Latin, whence Ulysses)'s entanglements with mortal and divine women in the course of his homecoming. The poem attributes to Odysseus Priapus’ own comically large penis, and places the organ at the very center of the epic. The statue argues that the memory of her husband Odysseus’ “fine tool” left Penelope reluctant to settle for the less-impressive suitors courting her, but also attracted the attentions of women—Circe, Calypso, and Nausicaa—for both good and ill in the course of the poem. Where Homer emphasizes Odysseus’ kingliness and manifest excellence, Priapeia 68 claims that Homer alludes euphemistically to the king's genitals. == Text == W.H. Parker's 1988 translation of the poem reads: No scholar I, but country-bred, so pardon me If I be crude: trees is my trade, not books, you see. Yet I know this bloke Homer, for my master proud Spends all his time out here a-reading him out loud. I hear, for instance, what we rustics call a prick Is ‘psolenta kheraunos’ in that chap’s Greek, And arse is ‘khouleos’, and ‘merdaleos’—‘foul’ It means—what you’d expect of prick that’s been in bowel. If Trojan cock had not brought Grecian cunt such fun, This Homer fellow’s book could not have been begun. If bloody Agamemnon’s prick had been less stout, He’d given old Chryses damn nowt to moan about; Nor would he then have snatched the maiden from his friend, And she’d have been Achilles’ own until the end: Who now upon his Pelethronian lyre must sing A woeful tune, himself stretched tenser than its string. And so began the hero’s noble rage, the same That’s the chief matter of the Iliad’s tale of fame. The other book’s about Ulysses and his treks, And, truth to tell, here too the cause of all was sex. You read about a beauteous blossom, ‘molyhock’, But when they speak of ‘moly’ they’re really meaning ‘cock.’ What else we read? How Circe—and Calypso too— Dulichian Ulysses for his fine tool they woo. Alcinous’ daughter wondered at it next; its size Was such that leafy bough could not its bulk disguise. Yet, all the same, to his old woman back he goes: His mind is in your cunt, Penelope, who chose To remain true, yet you’d invited many a guest, So with a crowd of would-be fuckers you were blessed; The idea being, I dare say, to find out who Was best at doing it of all that eager crew. “To firmer member”, says she, “no one could lay claim Than Ulysses, in strength and skill a master at the game. I need to know, now he has gone and left no trace, Which one of you is man enough to take his place.” I should have been the one, Penelope to fuck In your mate’s stead. But I was not yet made, worse luck. == Interpretation == Scholarship on Priapeia 68 has largely agreed that the poem was intended as a light-hearted work of satire. However, academics have disagreed somewhat on particular target of the humor. Catherine Connors, for example, has read the poem as a joke that largely falls on Priapus, parodying his obsession with sex as even inhibiting his ability to understand a foundational work of Hellenic culture. Others, however, have proposed that the poem lampoons the Epic Cycle itself, and that Priapus is not so much the target of the humor as is the wildly heterodox interpretation of Homer's work.Ed. Byrne, Shannon; Cueva, Edmond; Alvares, Jean. Authors, Authority, and Interpreters in the Ancient Novel: Essays in Honor of Gareth L. Schmeling. Groningen: Barkhuis Publishing, 2006. Despite the poem's relative obscurity, some scholars have drawn on Priapeia 68 for reasons largely unconnected to its language or topic. A.K. Gavrilov comments that others have often the narrator's claim to have often heard his master reading (dominum totiens audire legentem) as evidence that the ancients almost invariably read aloud. He summarizes Franz Bücheler, “How should Priapus know Homeric texts to laugh at them if not from his master reading them aloud in the garden?”Gavrilov, A.K.

Government of India, 434 U.S. 308 (1978), decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in which the Court held that foreign states are entitled to sue for treble damages in U.S. courts, and should be recognized as \\"persons\\" under the Clayton Act. ==Facts== In 1975, the government of India, filed an antitrust suit against pharmaceutical firms Pfizer, Inc., American Cyanamid Company, Bristol-Myers Company, Squibb Corporation, Olin Corporation and The Upjohn Company, alleging that these companies had conspired to restrain and monopolize interstate and foreign trade in the manufacture, distribution, and sale of broad spectrum antibiotics. The Imperial State of Iran, the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of Vietnam brought similar suits against one or more of these pharmaceutical firms, with the Supreme Court eventually deciding to recognize the additional cases in its ruling. The constitutional issues at stake in this case surround the U.S. Constitutions recognition of foreign people, entities or governments as \\"persons\\" with the right and ability to bring suit in U.S. courts against U.S. registered corporations under U.S. antitrust laws. The government of India had filed suit against these five pharmaceutical companies for damages under the Clayton Antitrust Act for their attempts to restrain and monopolize interstate and foreign trade surrounding the manufacture and distribution of certain broad spectrum antibiotics, in violation the Sherman Act. Accusations included the use of price fixing, market division and fraud committed against the US Patent Office.. Clayton Antitrust Act The Clayton Antitrust Act was enacted in 1914 to add additional substance to U.S. antitrust law by seeking to prevent certain anti-competitive practices during their inception, and continued a regime that started with the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. The Clayton Act specified particular prohibited conduct, outlined specific exemptions to the law, and provided for a tri-level enforcement regimen including measure intended to remediate prohibited conduct, expanding on the consumer protections that were provided under the earlier enacted Sherman Antitrust Act. Sherman Antitrust Act Enacted by Congress in 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act was the first federal law that prohibited business practices that were considered to be harmful to consumers, specifically those that were deemed to reduce marketplace competition. The act continues to serve as the basis for most antitrust litigation in federal courts. Defense The pharmaceutical companies involved in the suit were seeking to invalidate the case by appealing to the United States Court of Appeals 8th Circuit under the defense that non-US companies were not persons as defined under the Clayton and Sherman acts, making them ineligible to seek treble damages in the U.S. court system. The court Court of Appeals ruled against the defendants, finding that that treble-damages for persons injured by antitrust violations was first provided in section 7 of the Sherman Act, and was re-enacted without substantial change in 1914 in section 4 of the Clayton Act. Unsuccessful in invalidating their case through the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals, the defendants appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court asking the court to clarify the definition of 'persons' under the Clayton and Sherman acts, as section 8 of the Clayton act states: ::::\\"[A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefore in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee.\\" ==Judgment== The opinion of the Supreme Court was delivered by Justice Potter Stewart. The Court ruled for the government of India, affirming that a foreign nation otherwise entitled to sue in U.S. courts is entitled to sue for damages under the antitrust laws to the same extent as any other plaintiff. The fact that the respondents are sovereign foreign entities is not reason to deny them the remedy of treble damages the U.S. Congress has afforded to any person negatively affected by violations of U.S. or international antitrust laws. The Justices referred to the Sherman and Clayton antitrust laws in their ruling, as well as a prior ruling favoring the State of Georgia's right to sue in Georgia v. Evans.. Justice Stewart further stated in his opinion: The majority reasoned that a foreign nation is entitled to pursue damages when it its business or property has suffered damages caused by another entities antitrust violations. When a foreign nation conducts business in U.S. commercial markets, it can be victimized by anti-competitive practices in the same manner as a domestic U.S. State of private person. The issue of person-hood for a sovereign government was supported by prior case law, with Justice Stewart referring to two specific cases to support the majority argument. Both the United States v. Cooper Corp and Georgia v. Evans cases considered the rights of person-hood for government entities. While the Cooper case rules that the United States Government was not to be considered a \\"person\\" under US antitrust laws, the court ruled in Georgia v. Evans that the state was allowed consideration as a person. The decision did not rest on Georgia's status as a state but that unlike the federal government in the U.S. v. Cooper Corp ruling, the State of Georgia had been given no other remedy to enforce the prohibitions of the laws in question. Like the State of Georgia, the Government of India also had no other remedy outside of the court system. Dissent Chief Justice Burger dissented the ruling, joined by Justices Powell and Rehnquist. In his dissent, Justice Burger stated that a foreign nations entitlement to bring damage actions in U.S. courts against domestic suppliers for alleged violations of antitrust laws was never considered when the Sherman and Clayton Acts were enacted, and that the Clayton and Sherman acts did not extend the right of person-hood to foreign powers.Pfizer Inc., 434 U.S. at 320-21 (Burger, C.J., dissenting). Chief Justice Burger indicated in his dissent his dismay at the majorities recognition of a foreign government as a person under the Clayton and Sherman antitrust laws, while also noting that the majority option conceded that the question of application of the Sherman and Clayton Acts to foreign governments was never considered at the time the laws were enacted. He also referred to prior judgements under these acts, including the much more specific definition of person in the Clayton act. Citing the case of Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,. Chief Justice Burger highlighted the courts reliance on the specific definition of persons as outlined in the Clayton act, specifically the mention of foreign corporations and associations existing under or authorized laws of any foreign country as entities covered under the Act, but no mention the governments of foreign countries. ==See also== *US antitrust law ==Notes * Category:United States antitrust case law Category:United States standing case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court Category:1978 in United States case law ","title":"Pfizer Inc. v.

On 20 June 1956, approximately one hour and twenty minutes after departure, the flight crew reported trouble with one of the engines and turned back to New York. While dumping fuel in preparation for landing, the airplane, a Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation, caught fire and plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean off Asbury Park, New Jersey. All 74 aboard were killed; at the time, it was the world's deadliest disaster involving a scheduled commercial flight. However, its death toll would be surpassed only ten days later. ==The flight== The accident aircraft was a Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellation, registration YV-C-AMS, and named Rafael Urdaneta, under the command of Captain Luis F. Plata. The plane departed New York at approximately 11:15 p.m. on June 19. At 12:20 a.m. on June 20, some 250 miles east of Norfolk, Virginia, Captain Plata reported that the #2 propeller— the inboard propeller on the port (left) wing— was overspeeding, and radioed his intent to return to Idlewild. Twenty minutes later, the crew declared an emergency, stating that they had been unable to feather the #2 propeller. An Eastern Airlines flight under the command of Captain Charles Fisher, bound from New York to San Juan, diverted to monitor the situation and assist in relaying communications, while a U.S. Coast Guard aircraft piloted by Lieutenant Commander Frederick Hancox was dispatched to escort the stricken airliner back to New York. By 1:25 a.m., the Super Constellation, with its escorts in tow, was off the coast of New Jersey and beginning its descent into New York. Captain Plata requested and received permission to dump fuel, and began doing so at 1:29. Almost immediately, the crews of both escort aircraft observed the streaming fuel catch fire and erupt in a large fireball. The airliner swerved violently to the right, nosed over, and plunged into the sea, exploding on impact. Commander Hancox reported its rate of descent at 4,000 feet per minute, and that it was in a 90-degree bank at the moment of impact. Captain Fisher described the descent of the blazing aircraft as like \\"a falling star.\\" The accident occurred 32 miles east of Asbury Park, New Jersey. The Coast Guard plane circled the flaming wreckage, but could see no signs of life- only aircraft debris, along with pieces of clothing and personal effects. The Navy transport Lt. Robert Craig, the first surface ship to arrive, was on scene at 3:43 a.m. and radioed: \\"Found no survivors. Expect to find none.\\" Crews dispatched from the Craig in lifeboats recovered only fragments of bodies along with sundry debris. By dawn, any wreckage not recovered had sunk in 120 feet of water. ==Investigation and aftermath== The debris and remains recovered the night of the crash provided no clues as to the origin of the sudden fire; initial speculation was that fuel vapor may have come into contact with hot exhaust gases from one or more engines. Locating the main wreckage proved difficult due to the relatively wide dispersion of the debris- Hancox had observed the airliner shed flaming parts during its descent, and the final impact and explosion were described as violent, strewing debris over a considerable area. U.S. Navy salvage teams dragged grappling lines across the site for several days without success. Finally, a June 30 sonar search provided tentative identification of the main wreckage, which the Navy estimated would require \\"days or weeks\\" to raise. Minimal progress was made over the ensuing week, largely due to bad weather; On July 6, the Venezuelan government requested that recovery operations be halted. The investigation spent considerable time analyzing the events of the fuel dump in order to identify the likeliest source of the ignition. Hancox reported that as soon as Captain Plata commenced dumping fuel, Hancox observed sparks and flame in the vicinity of the #3 engine, the inboard engine on the starboard (right) wing, opposite the engine with the propeller problem. The investigative board concluded that the vibration induced by the runaway #2 propeller had caused internal structural damage to the starboard wing behind the #3 engine, between the fuel tank and fuel dump chute, as this area would have been the symmetrical point of the vibration. The board considered this the most probable cause, but stated that it was unable to determine this with certainty. Ruth Noel, widow of passenger Marshal L. Noel, subsequently sought damages from both the airline and United Aircraft (owners of Hamilton Standard, the manufacturer of the failed propeller). In the course of the litigation, evidence was introduced that within moments of the fuel dump commencing, the faulty #2 propeller broke free of its mountings and slashed into the fuselage. The double seat in the area of the impact was apparently ejected from the aircraft at this time, as it was found some distance from the spot where YV-C-AMS crashed; it had been cut in half from top to bottom by a heavy object. The bodies of its two occupants were among the few recovered from the scene; both had suffered leg amputations. Expert testimony provided two possible scenarios for ignition of the jettisoning fuel: * When the #2 propeller separated, the airstream blew sparks from its broken hub or shaft backwards into the plume of fuel; * When the #2 propeller slashed downward through the fuselage, it sliced through the cabin floor into the #5 fuel tank (center tank), immediately igniting the fuel within.

The group's name is pronounced ocean as a play on words with the Korean word for '5' being 'oh'. ==History== In 2004, two members Lee Hyun & Hwang Sung-hwan (John) spun off into a project group called 'After Rain'. In mid-2010, Hwang Sung-hwan (John) departed and formed 2NISE with Hohyeon & Jogeun. Later in September 2010, 5tion made a comeback as a three-member group consisting of Hwang Sung-hwan (John), Lee Hyun & Woo Il. In March 2012, the group made another comeback with a new member roster and stage names, reuniting three original members (Oh Byung-jin, Lee Hyun & Son Il-kwon) with two new members (LEN & Boseok). Wanting to reach out to the international fanbase, member names were changed to be more foreign sounding. Oh Byung-jin would be known as 'Cain', Son Il-kwon would be 'Roy' and Lee Hyun was shortened to 'Hyun'. Originally a ballad group, the return saw a change to dance music. On January 15, 2017, the group was involved in a car crash while performing in Japan. This occurred when the van slid on an icy road and into a delivery truck; they were immediately rushed to the hospital, and none of the group members were later reported to have had any serious injuries. ==Members== Current * Roy (로이) * Len (렌) * Noa (노아) * Marine (마린) Former * Taekyung (태경) * Chanmin (찬민) * Seokho (석호) * Minsung (민성) * John (존) * Hyun (현) * Boseok (보석) * Wooil (우일) * Kyne (카인) ==Discography== Studio albums { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:15em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:25em;\\"  Album details - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Incredible / True Image of New  *Released: December 27, 2001 *Label: Synnara Music, Ogam Entertainment *Formats: CD, digital download - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Album of the (Y)Ear  *Released: October 8, 2002 *Label: Synnara Music, Ogam Entertainment *Formats: CD, digital download - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Deal In Coal  *Released: February 1, 2006 *Label: De Passion, Esel International *Formats: CD, digital download - } Extended plays { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:15em;\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:25em;\\"  Album details - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Rebirth  *Released: March 22, 2012 *Label: Chani Entertainment, Danal Entertainment *Formats: CD, digital download - } Singles { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" border=\\"1\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Title ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Year ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width:5em;\\"  Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Sales ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Album - !

He obtained his M.A. and Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of Florida. He has held teaching positions at Denison University, the University of Texas at Austin, Wake Forest University, and Duke University. Leary is credited for publishing or editing 12 books and more than 200 articles or chapters for academic journals. He is a fellow of the American Psychological Association. Leary also founded the scholarly journal Self and Identity in 2001. Additionally, he has served on the editorial review boards of many other academic journals in psychology.VITA: Mark Leary In addition, he lectures for The Great Courses.\\"Mark Leary profile at TheGreatCourses.com\\" ==Topics of research== Leary's research has spanned the topics of the self and identity (social science), self-esteem, interpersonal motivation and emotion, need to belong, and self-compassion. Sociometer theory He is well known for developing the sociometer theory, an interpersonal explanation for variations in self-esteem within individuals. This theory suggests people have an internal measure of social acceptance (or rejection) which determines state self-esteem; unhealthy levels of state self-esteem encourage changes in affect, behavior, and/or cognition in order to regain social acceptance. The self Much of Leary's research is centered on the notion of the human self, self-awareness, and self-reflection. While there are clear benefits to the human ability to distinguish oneself from others and reflect upon past experiences, Leary and his colleagues have revealed many disadvantages as well. Examples include the tendencies to harbor bitterness, ruminate about imaginary scenarios, and panic about remote threats to safety. Each of these negative thoughts can lead to emotional challenges unique to the human species. Leary has also cited four aspects of the self which lead to interpersonal conflict: (1) self-other differentiation, (2) egocentrism, (3) self-esteem, and (4) egotism. Need to belong Leary, along with Roy Baumeister, wrote a 1995 paper on the need to belong. In the footsteps of Maslow, they believed that belonging is a human need. It is in our nature, they state, to attempt to form meaningful and lasting bonds with others. The inability to do so, or the breakdown of existing bonds, can have a negative, long-term effect on an individual, including problems with their psychological and physical health, as well as overall well-being. This negative impact is what defines belongingness as a need, as opposed to a simple desire. There are two aspects to the need to belong. There must be frequent interaction with little to no conflict, and the relationship must be ongoing. When one of these bonds is broken, people tend to try to replace the relationship with a new bond. These bonds form in a variety of relationships anyone, not just between a person and a leader or authority figure, such as proposed by the attachment theory of John Bowlby.Bowlby, J. (1969). Attachment and loss: Vol. 1. Attachment. New York:Basic Books. Self compassion More recently, Leary has published research surrounding self-compassion, a topic widely covered in positive psychology. Leary and his colleagues have defined self-compassion as \\"an orientation to care for oneself,\\" and have shown that individuals higher in self-compassion approach their shortcomings with significantly less criticism. Leary and his colleagues have shown many mental health benefits to be related to self-compassion, including lower levels of depression, neuroticism, dissatisfaction with life, and social withdrawal. In one study in which participants were asked to think of the worst event that recently happened to them and then indicate their reactions, thoughts, and emotions on the Self-Compassion scale, those with higher levels of self-compassion indicated that they tried not to be hard on themselves in the face of negative events. Self-compassionate people tended to be more accepting of flaws in their character and behavior than people low in self-compassion: people with high levels of self-compassion did not obsess or become defensive over undesirable parts of their character. The positive affects derived from self- compassion result in a decrease in negative reactions in the face of unfortunate events, including failure and rejection. Putting the situation into perspective and treating oneself with kindness diminished the need to exaggerate the negative event for the self-compassionate participants, compared to those who were not self-compassionate. Furthermore, Leary and colleagues have researched the relationship between self-compassion and physical pain. One particular study examined how self-compassion affects obese patients with persistent musculoskeletal pain, and found that patients who reported higher levels of self-compassion were less likely to pain catastophize and had lower levels of negative affect and pain disability. ==See also== *Sociometer ==References * Complete list of publications * Duke University Website Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:American psychologists ","title":"Mark Leary"},{"id":"35297406","text":"Greasy Pop Records was an Australian independent record label established by Doug Thomas (musician with The Dagoes and with The Spikes) in 1980 in Adelaide.

Late in 1982 The Dagoes disbanded and early in 1983 Thomas formed a \\"hard-edged, swampy acid-pop\\" band, The Spikes, which also released its material on Greasy Pop. In 1985, Greasy Pop issued a compilation album of tracks, An Oasis in a Desert of Noise, by its popular artists: Exploding White Mice, The Mad Turks from Istanbul, The Spikes, Primitive Painters, Dust Collection, Plague, Garden Path, Verge, Ded Nats, On Heat and Primevils. In 2006, Greasy Pop issued a DVD, An Oasis in a Desert of Celluloid, with 33 music videos. As from August 2006, the label was owned by Pete Hartman-Kearns and Monique Laver.

She edited the British magazine Vogue between 1940 and 1960 and was the author of The Palaces of Leningrad (1973) and an autobiography. While she used her own name professionally, in some other contexts she was known by her married names, Mrs A. H. Stewart from 1933 to 1952 and Mrs Victor Kennett from 1953 until her death. ==Early life== Derwent Water Withers was born at Hale in Lancashire (a parish later transferred to Cheshire), the daughter of Dr Percy Withers (1867–1945), a physician and author, by his marriage to Mary Wolley Summers (1870–1947).Drusilla Beyfus, 'Withers [married names Stewart, Kennett], (Elizabeth) Audrey (1905–2001), magazine editor' in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, 2005) Her mother, who had lost both parents at an early age, belonged to a family which owned John Summers & Sons, a company operating a steelworks on the Wirral, and was herself a graduate of Somerville College, Oxford.'Audrey Withers, Editor of Vogue during the years of war and austerity when prettiness mattered more than chic', Obituary in The Times, issue 67284 dated 31 October 2001, p. 19 The family soon moved to the Lake District, where Withers grew up with an older sister and a younger brother on the shores of Derwent Water. The girls were first educated at home by a governess. Their father had literary friends, including the Poet Laureate, Robert Bridges, and the artist Paul Nash. Withers went as a boarder to St Leonards School, St Andrews, then to Somerville, her mother's old college, graduating from Oxford in 1927 with a Second in philosophy, politics, and economics. ==Career== Hoping for a career in publishing, Withers took a job in a London bookshop, J. and E. Bumpus, then worked in the advertising section of a book publisher. During the Great Depression she lost her job and was unemployed for several months, during which she lived on an allowance of £2 a week from an uncle. This gave her a sympathy for the political left, and she was a Labour supporter for most of her life, until she joined the SDP in the 1980s. In 1931 she secured a new job as a sub-editor on Condé Nast's Vogue. The magazine had a small staff and she rose quickly, so that in 1940 Harry Yoxall appointed her as editor. She also joined the Condé Nast board. Golden Square, site of the Vogue offices During the war years Condé Nast treated Vogue as part of the war effort, printing advice and information, often from British government ministries. Women's magazines were powerful, and Vogue was a favourite publication of the ruling class, making Withers one of the most influential women in the country. During the London blitz she printed the iconic photograph by Cecil Beaton of an impeccably dressed model alongside the bomb site of the Temple, London, with the caption \\"Fashion is indestructible\\". Also in 1940 photographs by Therese Bonney of women and children refugees in France appeared in the magazine.Christopher Breward & Caroline Evans, Fashion and Modernity, p. 43 On the home front, Withers joined the London Fire Brigade as a volunteer and acted as a driver to senior officers. She was disappointed to be given no chance of driving fire engines, despite gaining a heavy goods vehicle licence. She kept the offices of Vogue in Golden Square, Westminster, open, cycling to work.Lindy Woodhead, War Paint: Madame Helena Rubinstein and Miss Elizabeth Arden (2003), p. 259: \\"Miss Blanche and all her colleagues at the magazine, led by editor Audrey Withers, braved the bombing of their offices and bicycled to work, dodging the debris, but still looking soignée in suits from Creed, Goodbrook, Angèle Delanghe, Lachasse, Ravhis and Bradleys.\\" Meanwhile, Harvey Nichols advertised in Vogue \\"Especially designed gas protection costumes... in oiled silk and available in dawn apricot, amethyst, eau-de-nil and rose pink\\". In the summer of 1944, the American photographer Lee Miller persuaded Withers to send her to Normandy to produce an article on nurses there, bringing Vogue into the actual coverage of the war; Withers was astonished by what came back, calling it \\"the most exciting journalistic experience of my war\\". She allowed Miller to follow the Allied advance through Europe, and Miller reported the liberation of Paris and even sent a story from Buchenwald. After the end of the world war, Withers promoted advanced causes, and alongside its traditional coverage of beauty and fashion Vogue developed a highbrow streak, publishing articles by Simone de Beauvoir, Bertrand Russell, Marghanita Laski, Dylan Thomas, Kingsley Amis, and work by features editors Lesley Blanch, and later (1947-1955 Siriol Hugh-Jones. Elizabeth David wrote on food, while the critic Penelope Gilliatt got her start in a Vogue talent contest inaugurated by Withers. Her photographers included Norman Parkinson, Antony Armstrong-Jones, and Irving Penn. She twice employed John Deakin as a staff photographer and twice dismissed him.Robin Muir, A Maverick Eye: the Street Photography of John Deakin (London: Thames & Hudson, 2002; ), pp. 8–9, 204 Her personal style was frugal, preferring sandwiches to expensive restaurants and buses to taxis, and she became a member of the Council of Industrial Design. Surprisingly, apart from hats, Withers lacked an interest in fashion,Beyfus (2005): \\"Neither did she have a personal interest in fashion...\\" so she delegated fashion coverage to others. She later wrote She resigned as editor of Vogue in 1960, sensing a wind of change. ==Private life== On 2 September 1933 Withers married Alan Hay Stewart, a salesman known as \\"Jock\\", who was the son of a musician. The marriage was childless and ended in divorce in 1952. On 20 February 1953 she married Victor Asarius Kennett (1895–1980), a Russian photographer whom she had first met in New York City during the war. With her second husband she lived on a farm, and while still at Vogue divided her time between London and the country. After her retirement they travelled widely, not least in the Soviet Union. With Kennett she produced a book, The Palaces of Leningrad (1973), the fruit of nine visits to the city.'The Palaces of Leningrad, by Victor and Audrey Kennett' in The Times, issue 58951 dated 29 November 1973, p.
