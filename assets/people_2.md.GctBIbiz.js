The experience and manifestation of survivor's guilt will depend on an individual's psychological profile. When the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) was published, survivor guilt was removed as a recognized specific diagnosis, and redefined as a significant symptom of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It may be found among survivors of combat, epidemics, murder, natural disasters, rape, terrorism, among the friends and family of those who have died by suicide, and in non-mortal situations. ==History== Survivor guilt was first identified during the 1960s. Several therapists recognized similar if not identical conditions among Holocaust survivors. Similar signs and symptoms have been recognized in survivors of traumatic situations including combat, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, air-crashes and wide-ranging job layoffs.JoNel Aleccia, \\"Guilty and stressed, layoff survivors suffer, too\\", NBC News, December 15, 2008 A variant form has been found among rescue and emergency services personnel who blame themselves for doing too little to help those in danger, and among therapists, who may feel a form of guilt in the face of their patients' suffering. Stephen Joseph, a psychologist at the University of Warwick, has studied the survivors of the capsizing of the MS Herald of Free Enterprise which killed 193 of the 459 passengers. His studies showed that 60 percent of the survivors suffered from survivor guilt. Joseph went on to say: \\"There were three types: first, there was guilt about staying alive while others died; second, there was guilt about the things they failed to do – these people often suffered post-traumatic 'intrusions' as they relived the event again and again; third, there were feelings of guilt about what they did do, such as scrambling over others to escape. These people usually wanted to avoid thinking about the catastrophe. They didn't want to be reminded of what really happened.\\" Sufferers sometimes blame themselves for the deaths of others, including those who died while rescuing the survivor or whom the survivor tried unsuccessfully to save.Bonnie S. Fisher, Steven P. Lab. Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention, SAGE, 2010, p. 33, ===Survivor syndrome=== Survivor syndrome, also known as concentration camp syndrome (or KZ syndrome on account of the German term '), are terms which have been used to describe the reactions and behaviors of people who have survived massive and adverse events, such as the Holocaust, the Rape of Nanking, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic.Walt Odets, \\"In the Shadow of the Epidemic: Being HIV-Negative in the Age of AIDS\\", 1995. In 1949, Eddy de Wind, a Dutch psychiatrist and survivor of Auschwitz concentration camp introduced the term \\"concentration camp syndrome\\" regarding the psychological consequences of persecution, describing the \\"pathological after-effects\\" unique to former prisoners of Nazi concentration and extermination camps. The subsequently well-documented syndrome among Holocaust survivors includes anxiety and depression, intellectual impairment, social withdrawal, sleep disturbance and nightmares, physical complaints and mood swings with loss of drive. Several studies have examined the \\"chronic and progressive\\" nature of the condition, with symptoms increasing in intensity as survivors age.Raphael Beverley, (1986). When disaster strikes. pp. 90-91. Century Hutchinson, London. Commonly such survivors feel guilty that they have survived the trauma and others – such as their family, friends, and colleagues – did not. Both conditions, along with other descriptive syndromes covering a range of traumatic events are now subsumed under post-traumatic stress disorder.Wilson JP, & Raphael B Editors. Theoretical and Conceptual Foundations of Traumatic Stress Syndromes. The International Handbook of Traumatic Stress Syndromes, p. 1. Plenum Press, New York. 1993. AIDS survivor syndrome AIDS survivor syndrome refers to the psychological effects of living with the long-term trajectory of the AIDS epidemic and includes survivor's guilt, depression, and feelings of being forgotten in contemporary discussions concerning HIV. While AIDS survivor syndrome has not been recognized as a pathologizable illness by the NIH (as of December 2017), scientific research and publications are available that address this issue. ==Examples Holocaust === Holocaust survivor Primo Levi was haunted by his experiences in Auschwitz and explored his survivor's guilt extensively in his autobiographical books, notably in I sommersi e i salvati (The Drowned and the Saved). Towards the end of his life he suffered from depression, and his death may have been suicide. === Elvis Presley === In an interview on Lifetime TV's Unsolved Mysteries, Lawrence \\"Larry\\" Geller, one of Elvis Presley's closest friends, reported that Elvis, as a twinless twin, was plagued by guilt over the death of his brother, Jesse Garon, who was stillborn. Elvis had confided to Geller about his concerns that maybe he had absorbed more than his share of the nutrients while he was developing inside his mother's womb, causing his twin brother to starve to death before he was born. Elvis had also related to Geller about how his mother had tried to comfort her son by assuring him that \\"they would all meet in Heaven\\" after their lives on Earth were completed. === Waylon Jennings === Waylon Jennings was a guitarist for Buddy Holly's band and initially had a seat on the ill-fated aircraft on The Day the Music Died on February 3, 1959. But Jennings gave up his seat to the sick J.P. \\"Big Bopper\\" Richardson, only to learn later of the plane's crash. When Holly learned that Jennings was not going to fly, he said, \\"Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up.\\" Jennings responded, \\"Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes.\\" This exchange of words, though made in jest at the time, haunted Jennings for the rest of his life.VH1's Behind the Music \\"The Day the Music Died\\" interview with Waylon Jennings. === Stoneman Douglas High School shooting === Sydney Aiello survived the 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, in which her close friend was killed. Aiello subsequently struggled with survivor's guilt, and she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. On March 17, 2019, Aiello died by suicide at the age of 19. A week later, on March 24, 2019, Coral Springs police announced that a juvenile male student from Stoneman Douglas High School had been found dead as a result of an apparent suicide. ==Cultural references== *Numerous episodes of The Twilight Zone series including \\"King Nine Will Not Return\\" and \\"The Thirty Fathom Grave\\" explored the topic of survivor guilt. *The 1979 novel Sophie's Choice and the subsequent movie feature a Polish Holocaust survivor who had to choose which one of her two young children was allowed to survive. *In the 1980 film, Ordinary People, based on the novel of the same name, Conrad Jarrett is a young man who struggles with surviving a sailing accident which killed his older brother. As Jarrett realizes that he is angry at his brother's recklessness, he confronts the very cause of his problems and begins to accept that his own survival had nothing to do with his brother's death. *In a 1987 episode of Family Ties, Alex Keaton (Michael J. Fox) goes to a therapist to deal with his own survivor's guilt after a friend is killed in a car crash while running an errand that Alex refused to help with. *The TV series Rescue Me follows the lives of firefighters post 9/11 in New York City, focusing on Tommy Gavin, a 9/11 first responder experiencing severe survivor guilt over the civilians he was unable to save and the other firefighters who died in the attack, many of whom he personally knew. *An episode of Law & Order: UK is entitled \\"Survivor's Guilt\\" and involves one character coping with how his colleague was shot while he survived because he was called away to see his new grandson. *The 2005 film Stay explores survivor guilt. *This phenomenon is also referenced several times throughout Kendrick Lamar's 2015 album To Pimp a Butterfly. *Type-Moon's 2004 visual novel Fate/stay night featured Emiya Shirou as the protagonist, whose survivor's guilt from 10 years ago was his main motivation during the whole novel, especially highlighted in the Fate route. *Rise Against, a popular punk band, released a song named \\"Survivor Guilt\\" on their 2011 album Endgame. *In the Hunger Games series, protagonist Katniss Everdeen feels survivor's guilt due to her and Peeta's surviving the games. *In Doctor Who, the Doctor is apparently responsible for ending the Time War by erasing his home planet Gallifrey. Being the only survivor of his species in the entire universe, he develops survivor's guilt as part of the trauma, which is openly addressed in the episode \\"Before the Flood\\". *Batman's main motivation for fighting crime is an unresolved survivor guilt after a mugger murdered both his parents. *In the 2004 sci-fi action film I, Robot, Will Smith's character of Det. Spooner has survivor's guilt. *In the TV show Arrow, the main character, Oliver Queen, has survivor's guilt in the episode \\"Three Ghost\\". *In The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, Max Vandenburg displays signs of survivor's guilt in the chapter known as \\"A Brief History Of The Jewish Fist Fighter\\". *In the 2006 movie We Are Marshall, Matthew Fox, Anthony Mackie, and Brian Geraghty all play members of the 1970 Marshall football team who were not on the plane when their team plane crashed. Fox played Red Dawson, a coach who gave his seat on the plane to another coach, Mackie played Nate Ruffin, a player who was injured and did not make the trip, while Geraghty played Tom Bogdan, a player who overslept and missed the flight. All are haunted by feelings of guilt that affect them long after the crash, into their later lives. *The light novel sequel to the 5th part of the long running manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure called Purple Haze Feedback has Pannacotta Fugo, a character from the beginning of the part who left the main cast in the main part when they went to fight the main villain, become distraught after learning of the deaths of three of his old comrades who joined the main fight and wonders why he didn't join them. *In an episode of TV show \\"Hawaii Five-0\\", Danny Williams mentions that his life since the September 11 attacks is all \\"borrowed time\\", when he and his then-partner Grace Tillwell raided a gang warehouse (without having told anyone about it) in the early morning hours of September 11, 2001, and were tortured by the gang members, who then killed his partner, and were about to proceed on him before being distracted by the sound of sirens outside, allowing Danny to break free and kill the gang members, before running outside to try and flag down a police car, only to see them speeding towards a huge billow of dark smoke. *Following the catastrophic June Rebellion, Marius of Victor Hugo's Les Misérables and the musical based on it appears to have Survivor's Guilt, highlighted in his solo Empty Chairs at Empty Tables. *Survivor guilt is explored in the Stephen King short story \\"The Things They Left Behind\\". The main character Scott Staley called in sick from his job at the World Trade Center on the morning of 9/11 in order to enjoy a day off in the sunny spring- like New York City weather that occurred that day. Almost a year later, personal belongings of co-workers who died in the tower begin showing up unexplained in Scott's apartment, accompanied by the haunting voices of their owners. *In Senki Zesshou Symphogear the protagonist Tachibana Hibiki suffers from survivors guilt after being one of very few survivors of a huge massacre at a stadium event. Moreover, she is blamed and aggressively attacked by people, who grieve over others lost at the same event, for surviving. As the aggression intensifies, it causes to break her family apart. *Survivor guilt is a central theme of Alice: Madness Returns. Alice has survivor's guilt after her family's death in a fire, with her guilt transforming Wonderland into a dark and dangerous place. *In the novel Beloved by Toni Morrison a former slave named Sethe imagines that she is haunted by the ghost of her baby which she killed to prevent her from getting caught and growing up in slavery. The ghost represents her guilt over the murder and her survival. ==See also== * Miklos Kanitz * Post-traumatic stress disorder * Stockholm syndrome * Survivors' Staircase * Survivorship bias ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Encyclopedia of Stress, Academic Press; 1st edition (April 2000) *Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, American Psychiatric Publishing; 4th edition (June 2000) Category:Abnormal psychology Category:Aftermath of war Category:Guilt ","title":"Survivor guilt"},{"id":"2204284","text":"MacArthur is a rapid transit station of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system in the Temescal District of Oakland, California. It is the largest station in the BART system, being the only one with four platform tracks. Service through MacArthur is timed for cross-platform transfers between the southbound lines that pass through the station. MacArthur station is in North Oakland, in the median of Route 24 just north of its interchange with I-580 and perpendicular to 40th Street and MacArthur Boulevard. The surrounding neighborhood is mostly low-density residential, making MacArthur station primarily a commuting hub.MacArthur BART access feasibility study BART Retrieved 24 August 2010 ==History== One of the tile mosaics at the station MacArthur station opened on September 11, 1972, as the northern terminus of the inaugural BART line, which ran to Fremont. Upon the opening of the Transbay Tube in 1974, the station began to serve Transbay trains to San Francisco. The station included several pieces of public art: an abstract mural by Mark Adams over a staircase (which Adams later replaced with two murals after the stairs were removed), and tile mosaics by Adams and Alfonso Pardiñas in the fare lobby. Nia Wilson was killed at the station on July 22, 2018. Sunday-only service to the station on the Dublin/Pleasanton line was operated from February 11, 2019 to February 10, 2020. ===MacArthur Transit Village=== Because of MacArthur's importance as an interchange and its location in the center of the East Bay, BART has conducted a number of feasibility studies about the prospects of creating transit-oriented development around the station. These studies have resulted in a plan for the \\"MacArthur Transit Village,\\" a mixed-use development on the eastern side of Route 24 bounded by 40th Street, Telegraph Avenue, and West MacArthur Boulevard.MacArthur Transit Village information sheet City of Oakland Retrieved 24 August 2010 The current plan calls for 624 residential units as well as of retail space.

There are two island platforms and four tracks. Platforms 1 and 2 serve the Richmond-Fremont line and the Richmond-Daly City/Millbrae line; Platform 1 goes Northbound towards Richmond, and Platform 2 goes Southbound towards Berryessa/North San José and Daly City/Millbrae. Platforms 3 and 4 serve the Antioch–SFO/Millbrae line; Platform 3 goes Northbound toward Pittsburg/Bay Point, and Platform 4 goes Southbound toward SFO/Millbrae. Connections between the lines are timed for Southbound passengers between Platforms 2 and 4. This is not the case for Northbound passengers, as a timed transfer point already exists further south at 19th Street Station. MacArthur tends to be crowded in the morning due to high transfer volume between two lines where only a few people get off while many are trying to board. Southbound trains converge to single track towards downtown Oakland, and San Francisco bound trains are given priority when departing in that direction. ==Bus connections== Connecting AC Transit transit lines at this station include Line 57 to Foothill Square and Emeryville and Line C to Piedmont and San Francisco. The free Kaiser Shuttle to Oakland Medical Center and another shuttle to Children's Hospital Oakland as well as shuttles to Alta Bates campuses also serve the station in addition to the free Emery-Go-Round bus system to Emeryville. ==See also== *List of Bay Area Rapid Transit stations ==ReferencesExternal links== *Official BART station page Category:Bay Area Rapid Transit stations in Alameda County, California Category:Buildings and structures in Oakland, California Category:Rail transportation in Oakland, California Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1972 Category:Railway stations in highway medians ","title":"MacArthur station (BART)"},{"id":"2204287","text":"Robert George Barrett (14 November 1942 - 20 September 2012) was a popular Australian author of numerous books, most of them featuring the fictional Australian character Les Norton. ==Best selling author== The character \\"Les Norton\\" was based on two likeable Sydney larrikin identities, Ken Wills, (Willsy) a polyathlete who was a retired Sydney TRG/ water police officer, deep sea diver, first grade rugby league player for South Sydney in the mid 70s, a professional boxer and a skiing gold medallist, although there is no corroborating evidence for many of these claims. The other character was amateur boxer turned seaman/waterfront worker \\"William ( Doogza ) Davis\\" an underworld hard man. Robert Barrett worked as a DJ and his two friends worked as doormen at \\"Randi Wix\\" night club in Randwick, thinly veiled as the nightclub where Les works in the tales (the nightclub in the books, the Kelly Club as it is called is actually based on the Kellett Club, a Terrace house in Kellett St Kings Cross as small but well known private casino). Both Doogsa and Willsy had associations with the Kellet club; Barrett did not. After work they would \\"grab drinks at the early opener at Kings Cross and swap stories,\\" whilst Barrett jotted down the occasional note. A montage of these stories and the continuing life experiences of these two uniquely Australian individuals are what appears in the Les Norton series. Therefore, the Les Norton tales are truer than may be imagined. Robert G. Barrett also wrote other single book stories. 'So What Do You Reckon?' is a collection of Robert's columns from when he was a columnist for the Australian People magazine. Barrett's books sold over 1,000,000 copies in Australia. ==Death== Robert Barrett died at Terrigal, New South Wales on 20 September 2012 after enduring a long battle with bowel cancer.Daily Telegraph, Sydney.

It has been described by witnesses as a huge beam of white light, reminiscent of a headlight on an old-fashioned train.Christensen, Joanne. (1995). Ghost Stories of Saskatchewan. Dundurn Press. p.81. The phenomenon has been featured on the television series Unsolved Mysteries and entails a strange light moving up and down along an old abandoned rail line at night, changing colours and varying in brightness. The line, located south of Prince Albert and north of St. Louis, has had its tracks removed, but the phenomenon still occurs on a regular basis. Several stories attempt to explain the lights, including that it is a ghost train, or the ghost of a drunk brakeman who lost his head to a passing train and now wanders up and down the tracks with a lantern attempting to find it. Chandler, Matt. (2018). Famous Ghost Stories of North America. Capstone Press. p.22. In 2014 Canada Post issued a stamp depicting the St. Louis ghost train, one of a series of five depicting Canadian ghost tales. Two twelfth grade students from La Ronge, Northern Saskatchewan won science fair gold medals for investigating and eventually duplicating the phenomenon, which they determined to be caused by the diffraction of distant vehicle lights. However, the light had been reported before the advent of cars. ==See also== * Marfa lights ==ReferencesExternal links== *Virtual Saskatchewan - The St. Louis Ghost Train *Virtual Saskatchewan - Family Ghost Hunt * St. Louis Light Information Page Category:Canadian ghosts Category:Canadian legends Category:Culture of Saskatchewan Category:Atmospheric ghost lights Category:Supernatural legends Category:Urban legends Category:Prince Albert No. 461, Saskatchewan ","title":"St. Louis light"},{"id":"2204293","text":"Patrick Bowes-Lyon, 15th and 2nd Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, (22 September 1884 – 25 May 1949) was a British nobleman and peer.

The Esplanade Riel illustrated is located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. This bridge is intended for pedestrian use only and has a restaurant in its base. In the example below the cable paths are aligned with the bridge centerline, so that structurally it differs only in the transfer of stresses through the tower to the foundation. Chords Bridge in Jerusalem The side-spar principle is not limited to a straight bridge, however. The tower could be offset and the bridge deck wrap around the spar in an arc, e.g., Chords Bridge in Jerusalem. Such a bridge would be particularly suited for use in the confines of a canyon, where the road is brought in the upstream direction down one side, crosses a stream, and turns back to a downstream direction on the other side. By placing a large portion of the turn on the bridge, rather than on the approaches, the turn may be made more gentle, allowing faster traffic. This would require more torsional (twisting) rigidity in the roadbed than would a straight bridge. A bridge of this type (supported by a spar), traveling through a much smaller arc, was one of the original proposals for the eastern span replacement of the San Francisco- Oakland Bay Bridge. Similar bridges, without the spar, could be supported by cables anchored in the canyon walls (where conditions are suitable). This subtype should not be confused with an asymmetrical single tower cable-stayed bridge, which possesses a single tower on one side of the gap to be crossed (see Rama VIII Bridge), nor with the cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge, which has span supporting cables on only one side of the tower along the direction of the roadbed. ==Image gallery== Image:SideSparCableStayBridge1.jpgEsplanade Riel, Winnipeg Image:WinnepegBridge.jpgEsplanade Riel, Winnipeg Image:Esplanderiel.jpgEsplanade Riel, Winnipeg Image:Jerusalem Chords Bridge 5.JPGChords Bridge, Jerusalem Image:Jerusalem Chords Bridge, Israel (1).jpgChords Bridge, Jerusalem Image:Jerusalem Chords Bridge.JPGChords Bridge, Jerusalem Image:HEIRABASHI20151231.jpgone-side-spar cable-stayed bridge Image:Newcastle-upon-Tyne-bridges-and-skyline cropped.jpgMillennium Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne ==See also== *Cable-stayed bridge *Cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge Category:Bridges by structural type ","title":"Side-spar cable-stayed bridge"},{"id":"2204297","text":"Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti is a 1985 album by the British new wave group Squeeze. It is the band's sixth album, and the first recorded since their breakup in 1982. It reunited songwriters Glenn Tilbrook and Chris Difford with drummer Gilson Lavis and keyboardist Jools Holland (now credited as \\"Julian\\"). Keith Wilkinson, who played bass on the 1984 Difford & Tilbrook album, joined Squeeze for the first time. He would stay with the band for over a decade, making him the longest-lasting bassist in Squeeze's history. Laurie Latham produced the album. The album peaked at number 31 in the UK Albums Chart. The album's title is a play on words, combining the name of the Mozart Italian- language opera Così fan tutte with the name of the Italian confection tutti- frutti (also the name of a Little Richard song). The album's cover art expands this into a visual pun, with a picture of a tea cozy (cosi), a fan, and a tutti-frutti dessert. In 1997, the CD was released in the UK with two bonus tracks, as part of the Six of One... box set. The set included the band's first six studio albums, each digitally remastered. These CDs were made available for purchase in 1998. Curiously, the 1997 remaster used the shorter versions of the songs originally issued on vinyl and not the longer versions issued on the first CD. ==Track listing== All songs written by Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook except as indicated.

He was granted the Seigneury of Villena in 1252, created for him to govern that lordship as \\"apanage\\" (a medieval micro-state that would return to the central crown if the minor lineage ends with no successor). This lordship would grow by receiving the cities around the Vinalopó River (Elda valley, Aspe, Crevillente, Elche). He also received the Adelantamiento of the Kingdom of Murcia. Manuel travelled to Italy in 1259 as part of the embassy sent by his father to Pope Alexander IV. Later, when his brother became king Alfonso X the Wise, served him as Alférez and Majordomo of the king. He died at Peñafiel in 1283 and was buried in the Monastery of Uclés. His son Juan Manuel, who succeeded him in Villena and Peñafiel among the others, and became prince of Villena, was a notable medieval writer.

Because the Xbox uses a digital signature system to prevent the public from running unsigned code, one must either use a modchip, or a softmod. Originally, modchips were the only option; however, it was later demonstrated that the TSOP chip on which the Xbox's BIOS is held may be reflashed. This way, one may flash on the \\"Cromwell\\" BIOS, which was developed legally by the Xbox Linux project. Catalyzed by a large cash prize for the first team to provide the possibility of booting Linux on an Xbox without the need of a hardware hack, numerous software-only hacks were also found. For example, a buffer overflow was found in the game 007: Agent Under Fire that allowed the booting of a Linux loader (\\"xbeboot\\") straight from a save game. The Xbox is essentially a PC with a custom 733 MHz Intel Pentium III processor, a 10 GB hard drive (8 GB of which is accessible to the user), 64MB of RAM (although on all earlier boxes this is upgradable to 128MB), and 4 USB ports. (The controller ports are actually USB 1.1 ports with a modified connector.) These specifications are enough to run several readily available Linux distributions. From the Xbox-Linux home page: > The Xbox is a legacy-free PC by Microsoft that consists of an Intel Celeron > 733 MHz CPU, an nVidia GeForce 3MX, 64 MB of RAM, a 8/10 GB hard disk, a DVD > drive and 10/100 Ethernet. As on every PC, you can run Linux on it. An Xbox > with Linux can be a full desktop computer with mouse and keyboard, a > web/email box connected to TV, a server or router or a node in a cluster. > You can either dual-boot or use Linux only; in the latter case, you can > replace both IDE devices. And yes, you can connect the Xbox to a VGA > monitor. == Uses == Xebian Booting An Xbox with Linux installed can act as a full desktop computer with mouse and keyboard, a web/email box connected to a television, a server, router or a node in a cluster. One can either dual-boot or use Linux only; in the latter case, one can replace both IDE devices. One can also connect the Xbox to a VGA monitor. A converter is needed to use keyboards/mice in the controller ports; however this is not difficult, as the Xbox uses standard USB with a proprietary port. Currently only a few distributions of Xbox Linux will run on the version 1.6 Xbox (the third newest version, including 1.6b). Xboxes with modchips and the Cromwell bios installed can run more distributions than those with only a softmod. This is mainly due to issues with the video chip used in version 1.6 Xboxes that was developed exclusively by Microsoft and which has no source code available at this time. This can cause significant overscan on all four sides of the screen when a different kernel than the original is loaded. == Softmod == One of the more popular ways of installing Xbox Linux is through a softmod, which does not require a modchip to use. The Xbox Linux softmod utilizes a save exploit found in the original run of MechAssault, Splinter Cell, 007: Agent Under Fire, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. The method involves loading a hacked save file transferred to the Xbox's Hard Drive. When the save file is loaded, the MechInstaller is initiated. The Xbox Live option on the dashboard is replaced with the new Linux option after rebooting the system. Another softmod that can be used is the hotswap exploit which will unlock the Xbox hard drive long enough to allow one to modify it. There is also a way to completely replace the Xbox's stock BIOS with a \\"Cromwell\\" BIOS, which is completely legal and is solely for Linux on the Xbox. However, once the TSOP (BIOS chip) is flashed with \\"Cromwell\\", the Xbox can no longer play Xbox games or run native Xbox executables (.xbe files, akin to .exe for Windows). == List of Distributions == There are several distributions of Xbox Linux, most of which are based on PC Linux distributions. {  - ! Distribution !! Description - Xebian/Ed's Debian  An Xbox Linux distribution that can install to the Xbox hard drive, or start a live session. A MythTV frontend can be run under Xebian and connect to a separate backend. - GentooxGentoox A Gentoo-based distribution, which features the \\"magic\\" updater, which allows users to download Xbox-specified packages and updates. - X-DSL A distribution based on Damn Small Linux. } == See also == * Free60 * Xbox * Linux == References  External links == * * Project site on SourceForge.net * Xbox Hacking official document * SoftMod Xbox for Free (Hotswap Technique!)

He was known as Kyōgoku dono (Lord Kyōgoku) or Go-Uji dono (the Later Lord Uji, 後宇治殿). He held the positions of sessho or kanpaku for a twenty-year period, sessho from 1075 to 1086 during the reign of Emperor Shirakawa and from 1094 to 1099 during the reign of Emperor Horikawa, and kampaku from 1086 to 1094 during the reign of Emperor Horikawa. He was the son of Fujiwara no Yorimichi and Fujiwara no Gishi (藤原 祇子, her real name is unknown today), a daughter of Fujiwara no Tanenari (藤原 種成), hence the grandson of Fujiwara no Michinaga. A contemporary document suggested he was the third born son, but this is uncertain. He was appointed to the positions of sadaijin, sessho and kampaku. He made his adopted daughter Kenshi (賢子) a consort of Emperor Shirakawa. Kenshi died when she was very young, but she left a son who would later ascend to the throne as Emperor Horikawa. Emperor Shirakawa seized political power and Morozane was unable to enjoy the monopolic power that his father and grandfather had enjoyed. Even after Emperor Horikawa reached adulthood, the cloistered Emperor Shirakawa seized power. Morozane married Fujiwara no Reishi, who was a daughter of Minamoto no Morofusa, a grandson of Emperor Murakami, and later adopted by Fujiwara no Nobuie. Morozane had many sons and daughters, including Fujiwara no Moromichi and Fujiwara no Ietada. From Morozane, two kuge families derive, the Kazanin family and the Oimikado (Oinomikado) family.

His books include Terror and Liberalism (a New York Times best- seller in 2003), The Flight of the Intellectuals, A Tale of Two Utopias, Power and the Idealists, and an illustrated children's book, Make-Believe Empire. He edited, among other anthologies, Carl Sandburg: Selected Poems, for the American Poets Project of the Library of America. Born to a Jewish family,Jewish Journal: \\"What will New Republic exodus mean for American Jewish thought?\\" by Anthony Weiss December 9, 2014 Berman attended Columbia University, receiving an M.A. in American history in 1973. Berman was a longtime contributor to The Village Voice, then The New Republic. He is critic-at-large at Tablet, a member of the editorial board of Dissent, and an Advisory Editor at Fathom. He has been awarded fellowships from the MacArthur and Guggenheim foundations and from the Cullman Center for Scholars & Writers at the New York Public Library. He was a Regents' Lecturer at the University of California, Irvine, and a Distinguished Writer in Residence at New York University.http://journalism.nyu.edu/faculty/paul-berman/ ==Totalitarianism and the modern world== In Terror and Liberalism, Berman offers a theory of totalitarianism. In his interpretation, totalitarian movements of the right and the left arose in Europe in the aftermath of the First World War as a reaction to the successes and failures of liberal civilization. The ideologies promoted mythologies of world events that were paranoid, apocalyptic, utopian, obsessed with purity, and ultimately nihilist. In Berman's account, the totalitarian movements were mass mobilizations for unattainable aims. Berman tries to trace the influence of these European movements upon the modern Muslim world. He identifies two principal totalitarian tendencies in the Muslim countries, Baathism and radical Islamism – mutually hostile movements whose doctrines, in his interpretation, overlap and have allowed for alliances. Berman regards suicide terror and the cult of martyrdom as a re- emergence of totalitarianism's nihilist strand. Berman draws a distinction between the religion of Islam, founded in the 7th century, and the political movement of radical Islamism. In July 2010, he wrote in the Wall Street Journal that \\"Islamism is a modern, instead of an ancient, political tendency, which arose in a spirit of fraternal harmony with the fascists of Europe in the 1930s and '40s.\\" In Berman's interpretation, observers relying on modern liberal values have sometimes found it difficult to identify the anti-liberal and anti-rational quality of totalitarian movements. Berman proposed this argument and offered an explanation based on the concept of \\"rationalist naiveté\\" in Terror and Liberalism. He developed the argument further in The Flight of the Intellectuals. Berman's ideas have influenced writers such as Martin Amis and Bernard-Henri Lévy, helping to shape debates about the concept of the \\"post-left\\" in Britain. Amis invokes Berman's argument in the opening paragraph of his book on 9/11, The Second Plane (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2008), p. ix. Regarding Lévy, see p. 269 of his book American Vertigo (NY: Random House, 2006) and an article in The American Interest. The British journalist Nick Cohen, in explaining his switch to support for the wider war on terror, cited Terror and Liberalism as a major influence: \\"The only time I realised I was charging up a blind alley was when I read Paul Berman's Terror and Liberalism. I didn't see a blinding light or hear a thunder clap or cry 'Eureka!' If I was going to cry anything it would have been 'Oh bloody hell!' ... I was going to have to turn it round and see the world afresh. The labour would involve reconsidering everything I'd written since 11 September, arguing with people I took to be friends and finding myself on the same side as people I took to be enemies. All because of Berman.\\" Berman's approach has not been without its critics. A writer in The Nation magazine, Anatol Lieven, labeled Berman a \\"Philosopher king\\" of the liberal hawks and criticized him for \\"[promoting] and [justifying] the most dangerous aspect of the Bush Administration's approach to the war on terrorism: the lumping together of radically different elements in the Muslim world into one homogeneous enemy camp.\\"Liberal Hawk Down, Anatol Lieven, The Nation, 7 October 2004 Berman has also been criticized in books by the liberal sociologist, Alan Wolfe, and the neo-Marxist political theorist, Robert Meister. ==Liberal interventionism and the Middle East== Berman argued that the NATO war in the former Yugoslavia in 1999 was justified by the doctrine of \\"liberal interventionism\\": an intervention intended to rescue endangered populations from extreme oppression and to promote liberal and democratic freedom. He looked on the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq in the same light. In the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, he declined to endorse the Bush administration's policy and warned that it was likely to fail: \\"we are wielding power without liberalism, which will turn out to be no power at all.\\" Once the invasion had begun, he nonetheless called on the liberal left to support the war on humanitarian and anti-totalitarian grounds, even while continuing to elaborate his criticism of the larger Bush Doctrine. His pro-war and anti-Bush positions confused some, as they managed to irk people on each side of the American political spectrum. His argument corresponded, however, to the views of the political tendency that is sometimes described as the anti-totalitarian left. He was one of the American signatories of the Euston Manifesto in 2006, a British document which expressed that tendency. Berman is also sometimes associated with the \\"New Philosophers\\" movement in France. Reflecting on the Iraq War in 2007, Berman wrote in The New York Review of Books, \\"I approved on principle the overthrow of Saddam. I never did approve of Bush's way of going about it. In the run-up to the war, I became, on practical grounds, ever more fearful that, in his blindness to liberal principles, Bush was leading us over a cliff… It is true and it is a matter of satisfaction to me that, in the years since then, I have not made a career of saying 'I told you so.'\\" Speaking of Israel in an interview, Berman commented of anti-Zionism that its \\"true origin ... is anti-Semitism, the assumption that the Jews are the center of the world and therefore the center of the world's evil.\\" ==History of the 1968 generation== Berman's A Tale of Two Utopias and Power and the Idealists are the first two parts of a history of the so-called Generation of 1968 (of which he was a member). He argues that packaged together with the liberal ideals in this movement were decidedly disturbing elements. Joschka Fischer, for example, the 1968 activist who would later become a leading figure in the German Green Party and Foreign Minister, decided that there was in fact the presence of anti-Semitic impulses in this movement when he saw the Revolutionary Cells participate in the Entebbe hijacking. The hijackers split the passengers by ethnicity, with Jews on the one side and non-Jews on the other, with the intention to kill all of the former. Also, Berman tracks major figures like Bernard Kouchner—the later founder of Doctors Without Borders—a member of the 1968 Generation who would later marry active improvement of human rights to established political goals. At the close of the book, Berman considers the effect of the war in Iraq on these graduates of '68. He suggests that the war split the movement greatly, with many now deeply aware of the dramatic excesses of the regime of Saddam Hussein, as well as the potential negative consequences if such a dictator remained in power. Nonetheless, they were deeply concerned by the arguments offered by the Bush Administration. ==Controversy== In 1986, Michael Moore became the editor of Mother Jones magazine and was fired a few months later partly for refusing to print an article by Berman that was critical of the Sandinista human rights record in Nicaragua. Moore stated that he would not run the article because he believed it to be inaccurate. \\"The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit.

HRS is usually fatal unless a liver transplant is performed, although various treatments, such as dialysis, can prevent advancement of the condition. HRS can affect individuals with cirrhosis, severe alcoholic hepatitis, or liver failure, and usually occurs when liver function deteriorates rapidly because of a sudden insult such as an infection, bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, or overuse of diuretic medications. HRS is a relatively common complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 18% of people within one year of their diagnosis, and in 39% within five years of their diagnosis. Deteriorating liver function is believed to cause changes in the circulation that supplies the intestines, altering blood flow and blood vessel tone in the kidneys. The kidney failure of HRS is a consequence of these changes in blood flow, rather than direct damage to the kidney. The diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome is based on laboratory tests of individuals susceptible to the condition. Two forms of hepatorenal syndrome have been defined: Type 1 HRS entails a rapidly progressive decline in kidney function, while type 2 HRS is associated with ascites (fluid accumulation in the abdomen) that does not improve with standard diuretic medications. The risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high; the mortality of individuals with type 1 HRS is over 50% over the short term, as determined by historical case series. The only long-term treatment option for the condition is liver transplantation. While awaiting transplantation, people with HRS often receive other treatments that improve the abnormalities in blood vessel tone, including supportive care with medications, or the insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), which is a small shunt placed to reduce blood pressure in the portal vein. Some patients may require hemodialysis to support kidney function, or a newer technique called liver dialysis which uses a dialysis circuit with albumin-bound membranes to bind and remove toxins normally cleared by the liver, providing a means of extracorporeal liver support until transplantation can be performed. ==Classification== The development of ascites (as shown on this abdominal ultrasound) in cirrhotics that is refractory to the use of diuretic medications is associated with type 2 HRS. Hepatorenal syndrome is a particular and common type of kidney failure that affects individuals with liver cirrhosis or, less commonly, with fulminant liver failure. The syndrome involves constriction of the blood vessels of the kidneys and dilation of blood vessels in the splanchnic circulation, which supplies the intestines. The classification of hepatorenal syndrome identifies two categories of kidney failure, termed type 1 and type 2 HRS, which both occur in individuals with either cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. In both categories, the deterioration in kidney function is quantified either by an elevation in creatinine level in the blood, or by decreased clearance of creatinine in the urine. === Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome=== Type 1 HRS is characterized by rapidly progressive kidney failure, with a doubling of serum creatinine to a level greater than 221 μmol/L (2.5 mg/dL) or a halving of the creatinine clearance to less than 20 mL/min over a period of less than two weeks. The prognosis of individuals with type 1 HRS is particularly grim, with a mortality rate exceeding 50% after one month. Patients with type 1 HRS are usually ill, may have low blood pressure, and may require therapy with drugs to improve the strength of heart muscle contraction (inotropes) or other drugs to maintain blood pressure (vasopressors).Mukherjee, S. Hepatorenal syndrome. emedicine.com. Retrieved on 2 August 2009 Unlike type II, in type I hepatorenal syndrome the kidney failure improves with treatment and stabilizes. Vasoconstrictors and volume expanders are the mainstay of treatment. === Type 2 hepatorenal syndrome === In contrast, type 2 HRS is slower in onset and progression, and is not associated with an inciting event. It is defined by an increase in serum creatinine level to >133 μmol/L (1.5 mg/dL) or a creatinine clearance of less than 40 mL/min, and a urine sodium < 10 μmol/L. It also carries a poor outlook, with a median survival of approximately six months unless the affected individual undergoes liver transplantation. Type 2 HRS is thought to be part of a spectrum of illness associated with increased pressures in the portal vein circulation, which begins with the development of fluid in the abdomen (ascites). The spectrum continues with diuretic-resistant ascites, where the kidneys are unable to excrete sufficient sodium to clear the fluid even with the use of diuretic medications. Most individuals with type 2 HRS have diuretic-resistant ascites before they develop deterioration in kidney function. ==Signs and symptoms== Both types of hepatorenal syndrome share three major components: altered liver function, abnormalities in circulation, and kidney failure. As these phenomena may not necessarily produce symptoms until late in their course, individuals with hepatorenal syndrome are typically diagnosed with the condition on the basis of altered laboratory tests. Most people who develop HRS have cirrhosis, and may have signs and symptoms of the same, which can include jaundice, altered mental status, evidence of decreased nutrition, and the presence of ascites. Specifically, the production of ascites that is resistant to the use of diuretic medications is characteristic of type 2 HRS. Oliguria, which is a decrease in urine volume, may occur as a consequence of kidney failure; however, some individuals with HRS continue to produce a normal amount of urine. As these signs and symptoms may not necessarily occur in HRS, they are not included in the major and minor criteria for making a diagnosis of this condition; instead HRS is diagnosed in an individual at risk for the condition on the basis of the results of laboratory tests, and the exclusion of other causes. ==Causes== Hepatorenal syndrome usually affects individuals with cirrhosis and elevated pressures in the portal vein system (termed portal hypertension). While HRS may develop in any type of cirrhosis, it is most common in individuals with alcoholic cirrhosis, particularly if there is concomitant alcoholic hepatitis identifiable on liver biopsies. HRS can also occur in individuals without cirrhosis, but with acute onset of liver failure, termed fulminant liver failure. Certain precipitants of HRS have been identified in vulnerable individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. These include bacterial infection, acute alcoholic hepatitis, or bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, which is the infection of ascites fluid, is the most common precipitant of HRS in cirrhotic individuals. HRS can sometimes be triggered by treatments for complications of liver disease: iatrogenic precipitants of HRS include the aggressive use of diuretic medications or the removal of large volumes of ascitic fluid by paracentesis from the abdominal cavity without compensating for fluid losses by intravenous replacement. ==Diagnosis== There can be many causes of kidney failure in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. Consequently, it is a challenge to distinguish hepatorenal syndrome from other entities that cause kidney failure in the setting of advanced liver disease. As a result, additional major and minor criteria have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. The major criteria include liver disease with portal hypertension; kidney failure; the absence of shock, infection, recent treatment with medications that affect the function of the kidney (nephrotoxins), and fluid losses; the absence of sustained improvement in kidney function despite treatment with 1.5 litres of intravenous normal saline; the absence of proteinuria (protein in the urine); and, the absence of kidney disease or obstruction of kidney outflow as seen on ultrasound. The minor criteria are the following: a low urine volume (less than per day), low sodium concentration in the urine, a urine osmolality that is greater than that in the blood, the absence of red blood cells in the urine, and a serum sodium concentration of less than 130 mmol/L. Many other diseases of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. Individuals with pre-renal kidney failure do not have damage to the kidneys, but as in individuals with HRS, have kidney dysfunction due to decreased blood flow to the kidneys. Also, similarly to HRS, pre-renal kidney failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration. In contrast to HRS, however, pre-renal kidney failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum creatinine and increased excretion of sodium. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney, and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis, because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure. Because of the damage to the tubules, ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally resorb sodium from the urine. As a result, ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing, as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS; however, this may not always be the case in cirrhotics. Individuals with ATN also may have evidence of hyaline casts or muddy-brown casts in the urine on microscopy, whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of cellular material, as the kidneys have not been directly injured. Some viral infections of the liver, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also lead to inflammation of the glomerulus of the kidney. Other causes of kidney failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity (notably, the antibiotic gentamicin) or contrast nephropathy, caused by intravenous administration of contrast agents used for medical imaging tests. ==Pathophysiology== Schematic demonstrating the underfill theory to explain the pathophysiology of both ascites and hepatorenal syndrome. Diagram showing hypothesized correlation between clinical features and pathophysiology of ascites and hepatorenal syndrome. The kidney failure in hepatorenal syndrome is believed to arise from abnormalities in blood vessel tone in the kidneys. The predominant theory (termed the underfill theory) is that blood vessels in the kidney circulation are constricted because of the dilation of blood vessels in the splanchnic circulation (which supplies the intestines), which is mediated by factors released by liver disease. Nitric oxide, prostaglandins, and other vasoactive substances have been hypothesized as powerful mediators of splanchnic vasodilation in cirrhosis. The consequence of this phenomenon is a decrease in the \\"effective\\" volume of blood sensed by the juxtaglomerular apparatus, leading to the secretion of renin and the activation of the renin–angiotensin system, which results in the vasoconstriction of vessels systemically and in the kidney specifically. However, the effect of this is insufficient to counteract the mediators of vasodilation in the splanchnic circulation, leading to persistent \\"underfilling\\" of the kidney circulation and worsening kidney vasoconstriction, leading to kidney failure. Studies to quantify this theory have shown that there is an overall decreased systemic vascular resistance in hepatorenal syndrome, but that the measured femoral and kidney fractions of cardiac output are respectively increased and reduced, suggesting that splanchnic vasodilation is implicated in the kidney failure. Many vasoactive chemicals have been hypothesized as being involved in mediating the systemic hemodynamic changes, including atrial natriuretic factor, prostacyclin, thromboxane A2, and endotoxin. In addition to this, it has been observed that the administration of medications to counteract splanchnic vasodilation (such as ornipressin, terlipressin, and octreotide) leads to improvement in glomerular filtration rate (which is a quantitative measure of kidney function) in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, providing further evidence that splanchnic vasodilation is a key feature of its pathogenesis. The underfill theory involves activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, which leads to an increase in absorption of sodium from the kidney tubule (termed renal sodium avidity) mediated by aldosterone, which acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal convoluted tubule. This is believed to be a key step in the pathogenesis of ascites in cirrhotics as well. It has been hypothesized that the progression from ascites to hepatorenal syndrome is a spectrum where splanchnic vasodilation defines both resistance to diuretic medications in ascites (which is commonly seen in type 2 HRS) and the onset of kidney vasoconstriction (as described above) leading to hepatorenal syndrome. ==Prevention== Picture of the esophagus at the time of endoscopy showing prominent esophageal varices. Bleeding from esophageal varices can be a precipitant for hepatorenal syndrome in individuals with cirrhosis, and can be prevented by early diagnosis and treatment. The risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high; consequently, there is a significant emphasis on the identification of patients who are at risk for HRS, and prevention of triggers for onset of HRS. As infection (specifically spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are both complications in individuals with cirrhosis, and are common triggers for HRS, specific care is made in early identification and treatment of cirrhotics with these complications to prevent HRS. Some of the triggers for HRS are induced by treatment of ascites and can be preventable. The aggressive use of diuretic medications should be avoided. In addition, many medications that are either used to treat cirrhotic complications (such as some antibiotics) or other conditions may cause sufficient impairment in kidney function in the cirrhotic to lead to HRS. Also, large volume paracentesis—which is the removal of ascites fluid from the abdomen using a needle or catheter in order to relieve discomfort—may cause enough alteration in hemodynamics to precipitate HRS, and should be avoided in individuals at risk. The concomitant infusion of albumin can avert the circulatory dysfunction that occurs after large-volume paracentesis and may prevent HRS. Conversely, in individuals with very tense ascites, it has been hypothesized that removal of ascitic fluid may improve kidney function if it decreases the pressure on the renal veins. Individuals with ascites that have become infected spontaneously (termed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or SBP) are at an especially high risk for the development of HRS. In individuals with SBP, one randomized controlled trial found that the administration of intravenous albumin on the day of admission and on the third day in hospital reduced both the rate of kidney insufficiency and the mortality rate. ==TreatmentTransplantation=== The definitive treatment for hepatorenal syndrome is liver transplantation, and all other therapies can best be described as bridges to transplantation. While liver transplantation is by far the best available management option for HRS, the mortality of individuals with HRS has been shown to be as high as 25% within the first month after transplantation. Individuals with HRS and evidence of greater hepatic dysfunction (quantified as MELD scores above 36) have been found to be at greatest risk of early mortality after liver transplantation. A further deterioration of kidney function even after liver transplantation in individuals with HRS has been demonstrated in several studies; however, this is transient and thought to be due to the use of medications with toxicity to the kidneys, and specifically the introduction of immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine that are known to worsen kidney function. Over the long-term, however, individuals with HRS who are the recipients of liver transplants almost universally recover kidney function, and studies show that their survival rates at three years are similar to those who have received liver transplants for reasons other than HRS. In anticipation of liver transplantation (which may be associated with considerable in-hospital delay), several other strategies have been found to be beneficial in preserving kidney function. These include the use of intravenous albumin infusion, medications (for which the best evidence is for analogues of vasopressin, which causes splanchnic vasoconstriction), radiological shunts to decrease pressure in the portal vein, dialysis, and a specialized albumin-bound membrane dialysis system termed molecular adsorbents recirculation system (MARS) or liver dialysis. ===Medical therapy=== Many major studies showing improvement in kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome have involved expansion of the volume of the plasma with albumin given intravenously. The quantity of albumin administered intravenously varies: one cited regimen is 1 gram of albumin per kilogram of body weight intravenously on the first day, followed by 20 to 40 grams daily. Notably, studies have shown that treatment with albumin alone is inferior to treatment with other medications in conjunction with albumin; most studies evaluating pre-transplant therapies for HRS involve the use of albumin in conjunction with other medical or procedural treatment. Midodrine is an alpha-agonist and octreotide is an analogue of somatostatin, a hormone involved in regulation of blood vessel tone in the gastrointestinal tract. The medications are respectively systemic vasoconstrictors and inhibitors of splanchnic vasodilation, and were not found to be useful when used individually in treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. However, one study of 13 patients with hepatorenal syndrome showed significant improvement in kidney function when the two were used together (with midodrine given orally, octreotide given subcutaneously and both dosed according to blood pressure), with three patients surviving to discharge. Another nonrandomized, observational study of individuals with HRS treated with subcutaneous octreotide and oral midodrine showed that there was increased survival at 30 days. The vasopressin analogue ornipressin was found in a number of studies to be useful in improvement of kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, but has been limited in its use, as it can cause severe ischemia to major organs. Terlipressin is a vasopressin analogue that has been found in one large study to be useful for improving kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome with a lesser incidence of ischemia but is not available in the United States. In September 2020, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a Complete Response Letter which stated that based on the available data, the agency cannot approve the terlipressin NDA in its current form and requires more information to support a positive risk-benefit profile for terlipressin for patients with HRS-1. A key criticism of all of these medical therapies has been heterogeneity in the populations investigated and the use of kidney function, instead of mortality, as an outcome measure. Other agents that have been investigated for use in treatment of HRS include pentoxifylline, acetylcysteine, and misoprostol. The evidence for all of these therapies is based on either case series, or in the case of pentoxifylline, extrapolated from a subset of patients treated for alcoholic hepatitis. ===Procedural treatments=== TIPS, shown in progress here, has been shown to improve kidney function in individuals with HRS if portal pressures decrease after the procedure. A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) involves the decompression of the high pressures in the portal circulation by placing a small stent between a portal and hepatic vein. This is done through radiologically guided catheters which are passed into the hepatic vein either through the internal jugular vein or the femoral vein. Theoretically, a decrease in portal pressures is thought to reverse the hemodynamic phenomena that ultimately lead to the development of hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS has been shown to improve kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome. Complications of TIPS for treatment of HRS include the worsening of hepatic encephalopathy (as the procedure involves the forced creation of a porto- systemic shunt, effectively bypassing the ability of the liver to clear toxins), inability to achieve adequate reduction in portal pressure, and bleeding. Liver dialysis involves extracorporeal dialysis to remove toxins from the circulation, usually through the addition of a second dialysis circuit that contains an albumin-bound membrane. The molecular adsorbents recirculation system (MARS) has shown some utility as a bridge to transplantation in patients with hepatorenal syndrome, yet the technique is still nascent. Renal replacement therapy may be required to bridge individuals with hepatorenal syndrome to liver transplantation, although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used. The use of dialysis, however, does not lead to recuperation or preservation of kidney function in patients with HRS, and is essentially only used to avoid complications of kidney failure until transplantation can take place. In patients who undergo hemodialysis, there may even be an increased risk of mortality due to low blood pressure in patients with HRS, although appropriate studies have yet to be performed. As a result, the role of renal replacement therapy in patients with HRS remains unclear. ==Epidemiology== As the majority of individuals with hepatorenal syndrome have cirrhosis, much of the epidemiological data on HRS comes from the cirrhotic population. The condition is quite common: approximately 10% of individuals admitted to hospital with ascites have HRS. A retrospective case series of cirrhotic patients treated with terlipressin suggested that 20.0% of acute kidney failure in cirrhotics was due to type 1 HRS, and 6.6% was due to type 2 HRS. It is estimated that 18% of individuals with cirrhosis and ascites will develop HRS within one year of their diagnosis with cirrhosis, and 39% of these individuals will develop HRS within five years of diagnosis. Three independent risk factors for the development of HRS in cirrhotics have been identified: liver size, plasma renin activity, and serum sodium concentration. The prognosis of these patients is grim with untreated patients having an extremely short survival. The severity of liver disease (as evidenced by the MELD score) has been shown to be a determinant of outcome. Some patients without cirrhosis develop HRS, with an incidence of about 20% seen in one study of ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis. ==History== The first reports of kidney failure occurring in individuals with chronic liver diseases were from the late 19th century by Frerichs and Flint. However, the hepatorenal syndrome was first defined as acute kidney failure that occurred in the setting of biliary surgery. The syndrome was soon re-associated with advanced liver disease, and, in the 1950s, was clinically defined by Sherlock, Hecker, Papper, and Vessin as being associated with systemic hemodynamic abnormalities and high mortality. Hecker and Sherlock specifically identified that individuals with HRS had low urinary output, very low sodium in the urine, and no protein in the urine. Murray Epstein was the first to characterize splanchnic vasodilation and kidney vasoconstriction as the key alterations in hemodynamics in patients with the syndrome. The functional nature of the kidney impairment in HRS was crystallized by studies demonstrating that kidneys transplanted from patients with hepatorenal syndrome returned to function in the new host, leading to the hypothesis that hepatorenal syndrome was a systemic condition and not a kidney disease. The first systematic attempt to define hepatorenal syndrome was made in 1994 by the International Ascites Club, a group of liver specialists. The more recent history of HRS has involved elucidation of the various vasoactive mediators that cause the splanchnic and kidney blood flow abnormalities of the condition. ==References== Category:Syndromes affecting the kidneys Category:Syndromes affecting the hepatobiliary system ","title":"Hepatorenal syndrome"},{"id":"2204334","text":"Babylon and On is the seventh album released in 1987 by the British new wave group Squeeze. ==History== Eric \\"ET\\" Thorngren produced the album, along with Glenn Tilbrook.

Brahms' title is generally written in English as \\"Academic Festival\\" Overture, but in the German title, the adjective \\"akademisch\\" modifies Festouvertüre, not Fest. It is the overture that is festive, not an \\"Academic Festival\\" occasioning it. Op. 80, by Johannes Brahms, was one of a pair of contrasting concert overtures — the other being the Tragic Overture, Op. 81\\\\. Brahms composed the work during the summer of 1880 as a tribute to the University of Breslau, which had notified him that it would award him an honorary doctorate in philosophy. ==Background== Initially, Brahms had contented himself with sending a simple handwritten note of acknowledgment to the University, since he loathed the public fanfare of celebrity. However, the conductor Bernhard Scholz, who had nominated him for the degree, convinced him that protocol required him to make a grander gesture of gratitude. The University expected nothing less than a musical offering from the composer. \\"Compose a fine symphony for us!\\" he wrote to Brahms. \\"But well orchestrated, old boy, not too uniformly thick!\\"Jan Swafford, Johannes Brahms: A Biography(1997:462). ==Structure and instrumentation== Brahms, who was known to be an ironic joker, filled his quota by creating a \\"very boisterous potpourri of student drinking songs à la Suppé\\"In a letter to Max Kalbeck in an intricately designed structure made to appear loose and episodic, thus drawing on the \\"academic\\" for both his sources and their treatment. The work sparkles with some of the finest virtues of Brahms's orchestral technique, sometimes applied for comic effect, such as the bassoons that inflate the light subject of \\"Fuchslied\\" (Was kommt dort von der Höh?).The comic effect is noted in Jan Swafford 1997:462. The inventive treatment includes tunes appropriated from the student ditties \\"Fuchslied\\", \\"Wir hatten gebauet ein stattliches Haus\\", \\"Hört, ich sing das Lied der Lieder\\", and most memorably, the broad, triumphant finale on \\"Gaudeamus igitur\\", which succinctly engages Brahms's sophisticated mastery of counterpoint, further fulfilling the \\"academic\\" aspect of his program, cheekily applied to the well-worn melody. Brahms manages to evoke ravishing euphoria without sacrificing his commitment to classical balance. The blend of orchestral colors is carefully planned and highlighted in the piece, which, in spite of Scholz's request, calls for one of the largest ensembles for any of his compositions: piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets (both doubling in B and C clarinets), two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns (two in C and two in E), three C trumpets, three trombones, one tuba, timpani, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, and strings. The Overture consists of four continuous sections: ==Convocation for the premiere and awarding of the degree== The composer himself conducted the premiere of the overture, and received his honorary degree, at a special convocation held by the University on January 4, 1881. To the chagrin (or mischievous delight) of many of the academics in the audience, there was an \\"ironic\\" contrast between the mood of the student drinking songs and the seriousness of a ceremony.Oxford Companion to Music, Alison Latham, ed., Oxford University Press, 2003 ==Reception== Because of its easily grasped structure, its lyrical warmth, and its excitement and humor, the work has remained a staple of today's concert-hall repertoire. A typical performance lasts around ten minutes. ==References in popular culture== Cary Grant in his role as Dr. Noah Praetorius conducts the Overture at the beginning and end of the 1951 Joseph L. Mankiewicz/Darryl F. Zanuck film, People Will Talk, and part of the piece can also be heard in the opening theme of the 1978 film, National Lampoon's Animal House, an ironic gesture given that the classic music was originally based on German fraternity drinking songs. In the 1967 film Bedazzled, Dudley Moore, as a pretentious pseudo- intellectual Welsh student, and Eleanor Bron lie on the floor listening to the beginning of the Overture on an LP until the record begins to skip (thanks to a scratch deliberately made in the LP by Peter Cook as the Devil earlier in the film). The song Catch a Falling Star, made famous by Perry Como was based on the third melody in just before the Gaudeamus Igitur. ==NotesExternal links== *Program notes from the Los Angeles Philharmonic * Category:Compositions by Johannes Brahms Category:Concert overtures Category:1880 compositions Category:German patriotic songs ","title":"Academic Festival Overture"},{"id":"2204351","text":"The Answer may refer to: ==Arts and entertainmentMusic=== *The Answer (band), a rock band from Northern Ireland Albums *The Answer (album), by Gloria Gaynor *The Answer (EP), by Unkle, and the title song *The Answer, by Peter Bardens Songs *\\"The Answer\\", by Bad Religion from the album Generator *\\"The Answer\\", by Bloc Party from the album Bloc Party *\\"The Answer\\", by Blue October from the album The Answers *\\"The Answer\\", by Britney Spears from the album In the Zone *\\"The Answer\\", by Candlebox from the album Into the Sun *\\"The Answer\\", by Myka Relocate from the album Lies to Light the Way *\\"The Answer\\", by Richie Sambora from the album Stranger in This Town *\\"The Answer\\", by Savages from the album Adore Life ===Other media=== *The Answer (novel), a book in the Animorphs series *\\"The Answer\\" (short story), a 1959 science fiction short story by H.

He began his career in the late 1950s, with the group Les Chaussettes Noires (The Black Socks), taking his name from the American expatriate tough-guy actor Eddie Constantine (later the star of Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville) and Mitchell simply because it sounds American. The band performed at the Parisian nightclub Golf-Drouot before signing to Barclay Records and finding almost instant success; in 1961 it sold two million records. Heavily influenced by American rock and roll, Mitchell (who went solo in 1963) has often recorded outside France, at first in London, but later in Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee. Guitarists Big Jim Sullivan and Jimmy Page and drummer Bobby Graham were among the British session musicians who regularly supported him in London. For his American recordings he employed session men such as Roger Hawkins, David Hood, Jimmy Johnson, Kenneth Buttrey, Reggie Young, David Briggs, Charlie McCoy, Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper and others.Happy Birthday, Eddy Mitchell, EM Productions, 1980, liner notes A great lover of American films, he hosted La Dernière Séance, a TV show about American cinema from 1981 to 1998 on FR3 (later France 3). Its format was like an old-fashioned double-feature picture show, with two movies, cartoons, newsreels, and stage attractions. The title was taken from the name of one of Mitchell's albums, which in turn took it from the French title of the movie The Last Picture Show. He is also the voice of Dylan (Flappy) in the French version of the 2005 film of The Magic Roundabout, as well as the voice of Chanticleer in the French version of Rock-a-Doodle. ==DiscographyAlbums=== ;with Les 5 Rocks *1960 – Les 5 Rocks (remained unreleased until 1996) ;with Les Chaussettes noires *1961 : 100% rock *1961 : Rock'n'Twist *1962 : Le 2 000 000e disque des Chaussettes noires (1st official studio album) *1962 : Comment réussir en amour (soundtrack of film with same title) *1963 : Chaussettes Noires Party (2nd and last studio album) ;Solo studio albums *1963 : Voici Eddy... c'était le soldat Mitchell *1963 : Eddy in London *1964 : Panorama *1964 : Toute la ville en parle...

The series follows Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub), a private detective with obsessive–compulsive disorder and multiple phobias, and his assistant Sharona Flemming (Bitty Schram). In this episode, Monk travels to New York City in an attempt to discover his wife's killer, but may solve the case of the death of the Latvian ambassador. Written by Andy Breckman and directed by Randall Zisk, \\"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan\\" was shot in New York. When the episode first aired in the United States on USA Network on June 18, 2004, it was watched by 5.5 million viewers. The episode garnered a mixed reaction from critics, praising the comedy obtained through putting Monk in a scenario that would arouse his fears while criticizing Monk's exaggerated reactions to the setting. ==Plot== Detective Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) flies to New York City to find criminal Warrick Tennyson (Frank Collison). In the preceding episode, criminal Dale \\"The Whale\\" Biederbeck (Tim Curry) told Monk that Tennyson was involved in the murder of Monk's wife, Trudy. On the trip, Monk is accompanied by his nurse Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram), and police officers Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray- Stanford). They stay at the same hotel as the Latvian ambassador, who is subsequently discovered shot to death along with his two bodyguards. Police Captain Walter Cage (Mykelti Williamson) asks for Monk's help in solving the murder. Monk notices the ambassador's coat is damp, even though it had been dry minutes before the murder. The four retrace the ambassador's movements that day, discovering that he had stopped at a bar before arriving at the hotel. Then, Stottlemeyer and Disher go back to the precinct to try to get a bead on Tennyson's location while Monk and Sharona discover that the ambassador's final words meant \\"This is not my coat\\". Stottlemeyer breaks into Cage's office to discover that Tennyson is dying in a hospital and has days left to live. Stottlemeyer confronts Cage, who says the only way he will allow access to Tennyson is if Monk solves the ambassador's murder. Monk is briefly separated from the group after accidentally boarding the wrong train at Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. While reuniting with his partners he notices Steven Leight (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) being interviewed on a TV screen in Times Square about the recent murder of his wife. Noticing Leight eating a mint from the same bar the ambassador had last been seen, Monk insists Steven Leight is the ambassador's murderer, despite the lack of supporting evidence. To support his theory, Monk proposes that Leight stole his wife's jewelry to stage a robbery, then proceeded to the bar before calling the police. He asserts Leight and the ambassador were wearing essentially identical coats, and that they must have been switched accidentally at the bar. As rain falls, Leight locates the ambassador's hotel room, and subsequently kills both him and his bodyguards, and switches the newly wet coat with his own. Subsequently, a ballistics report confirms that Leight killed his wife and the ambassador with the same gun and Leight is arrested. Having solved the case, Monk is allowed to visit Tennyson who remembers being hired by a man who had six fingers on his right hand. Tennyson asks for forgiveness, but Monk cannot bring himself to give it. He turns off Tennyson's morphine drip saying, \\"This is me, turning off your morphine;\\" but a few moments later, he says, \\"This is Trudy, the woman you killed, turning it back on,\\" and does. The foursome prepares to leave New York, having gotten a step further in solving Monk's most important case. ==Production== Although the character did not appear in the episode, Trudy (played in flashbacks by Melora Hardin from the third season) is a driving element of Monk that producers tried to explore in this episode. \\"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan\\" was written by Andy Breckman and directed by Randall Zisk. Series creator and executive producer Breckman was credited for the script for the fifth time in the series, while it was the sixth time Zisk worked on a Monk episode. While Monk's second season was entirely filmed and produced in Los Angeles, \\"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan\\" was shot in New York City in March 2004. In the series' plot, Trudy was killed years prior to its first episode, which led Monk to develop obsessive–compulsive disorder and to be discharged from the San Francisco Police Department. At the beginning of the third season, executive producer and co-creator David Hoberman said the staff felt it was a good idea to explore Trudy's death. They were, however, careful about the manner in which they mentioned her death and Monk's desire to find the culprit. This was out of concern that they would \\"burden\\" the series with it. ==Reception== \\"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan\\" was first broadcast in the United States on the USA Network at 9 pm EST on June 18, 2004. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was viewed by an estimated number of 5.9 million viewers. It was the third most watched program on cable television that week with a 3.6 percent household rating and a household audience of 3.9 million. CurrentFilm.com and MovieFreak.com's Dennis Landmann qualified it as one of the best episodes of the season. Seattle Post-Intelligencers Melanie McFarland said although it is \\"a fecund opportunity for cheap laughs\\", Shalhoub was able to keep the \\"balance between Monk's power and helplessness without caving into lower comedic impulses.\\" McFarland praised its writing and Shalhoub, saying \\"It would begin to look like shoddy choreography\\" if they were not good. \\"A welcome return\\" was how it was described by Robert Lloyd from the Los Angeles Times who asserted its \\"pleasures are all in the predictable eccentricities of its characters, and the fact that it's clearly being staged for our benefit.\\" Ted Cox of the Chicago-area Daily Herald praised the scene when Monk forgives Tennyson dubbing it \\"great TV.\\" Chris Hicks of Deseret News deemed it as \\"a terrific example of how the writers come up with simple situations that throw Monk into turmoil but also allow us to identify with him: Monk in Manhattan. The crowds, the noise, the confusion. Perfect.\\" Not all reviews were positive. David Bianculli, writing in the New York Daily News, stated that the idea of putting Monk in New York \\"sound[ed] great\\" on paper but it did not take advantage of what could be \\"a delightful study in contrasts.\\" Bianculli called it a \\"misstep\\", criticizing its premise and how it was not able to keep the balance between comedy and drama that made it \\"too outrageous.\\" A review for The Beaver County Times considered it a \\"stunt episode\\" and its humor \\"uncharacteristically forced\\", saying it \\"really doesn't do justice to the show's considerable charms.\\" Steve Johnson of the Chicago Tribune affirmed that while the premise is funny, \\"the writers go out of their way to play the city against his condition.\\" He continued by saying it \\"wouldn't be so bad\\" if he went to solve crimes \\"but Friday's first case is a real stretch.\\" Although excited for the episode's premise prior to its broadcast, Austin Smith of the New York Post was very critical of it. Smith said in this episode \\"the producers have him [Monk] crossing that fine line between genius and insanity, transforming our hero into a full-blown mental patient.\\" He also criticized the \\"Mr. Monk vs. the City of New York\\" scenes as they do not further the episode's plot. Smith's co-worker, Linda Stasi also panned the episode, considering Monk's reactions \\"caricature[d]\\". Stasi wrote, \\"It's one thing to be an obsessive/compulsive ex-detective who lines up the pins on the murder map and it's another to act like you've got a pin in your brain.\\" As did Smith, Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called the jokes \\"predictable\\" and said, \\"If you aren't a Monk fan, these devices may strike you as altogether shopworn.\\" ==ReferencesCategory:Monk (TV series) episodes Category:2004 American television episodes Category:Fictional portrayals of the New York City Police Department ","title":"Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan"},{"id":"2204364","text":"D. Boon and Friends is a compilation album of various recordings featuring Minutemen guitarist and frontman D. Boon. The album is the inaugural release of the Hermosa Beach, California-based label Box-O-Plenty Records, started by Boon's one-time roommate Richard Derrick. Most of the tracks are living-room jam sessions (on guitars, bass and cheap keyboards) done by Boon, Derrick, and Crane, who had previously contributed backing vocals and trumpet parts to Minutemen's Buzz or Howl Under the Influence of Heat and Project: Mersh EP's. Also heard on the album are live recordings of a one-time project band featuring Boon and three percussionists under the band name Hammerdown, a rare D. Boon acoustic solo show, a tape of a Minutemen gig with Derrick substituting for drummer George Hurley (who couldn't get time off work to participate in the show), and an experimental demo recording featuring D. Boon overdubbing three different lead guitar parts over a rhythm guitar track. The cover art of D. Boon And Friends is derived from a Christmas card Boon had given Derrick in 1984. Mike Watt, as curator of the Minutemen legacy, gave the project his blessing, as did D. Boon's late father. Watt, Meat Puppets drummer Derrick Bostrom, Crane, and Richard Derrick all contributed liner notes. In keeping with a Minutemen crediting tradition, Boon and many of the other participants are credited with \\"singing\\" instead of \\"vocals.\\" The first pressing of the CD had a purple cover. Current pressings have the front cover printed with an off-yellow background. Customers who order the CD directly from the label also receive a bonus 23-minute CD-R of other Boon/Crane/Derrick jam sessions and solo live tracks that didn't fit into the original track sequence. ==Recording details== *Tracks 1–16, 20–21 recorded at various living room and party jams between November 1984 and June 1985. *Tracks 17–19 recorded live at The Music Machine, Los Angeles, California, April 5, 1984 *Tracks 22–25 recorded live at The Lhasa Club, West Hollywood, California, June 27, 1984 *Tracks 26–32 recorded live at University Of California, Los Angeles, California, January 30, 1985 *Track 33 recorded at D.

He is best known for his appearances with the World Wrestling Federation under the ring names The Tonga Kid and Tama and with World Championship Wrestling as The Samoan Savage. == Professional wrestling career  World Wrestling Federation (1983–1988) === Fatu debuted as a professional wrestler in 1983, after being trained by the Wild Samoans. Shortly after debuting he joined the World Wrestling Federation as \\"Samoan No. 4,\\" wrestling at untelevised house shows before making his television debut in the fall of 1983 as the Tonga Kid. Billed as the cousin of Superfly Jimmy Snuka, he entered into his first major feud with Snuka's rival Roddy Piper. In late 1986, he teamed with Tonga Fifita, who was wrestling under the name King Tonga. Fatu was renamed to Tama, while Fifita was renamed to Haku. Together, they were christened The Islanders. The Islanders gained several key victories, including a tag team battle royal victory over Big John Studd and King Kong Bundy, but ultimately failed to gain the interest of fans. The two were eventually repackaged as villains in April 1987 after attacking The Can- Am Connection during a match; the team was now managed by Bobby Heenan, and used an aggressive, savage style of wrestling as opposed to a scientific style. In the fall of 1987, they began a feud with Strike Force, and while the two teams generally traded victories during the early part of the feud, once Strike Force won the WWF Tag Team Championship, the Islanders began finding themselves on the losing end, despite having several attempts. In early December 1987, the Islanders were disqualified from a match with the British Bulldogs when they kidnapped the Bulldogs' dog, Matilda. The Islanders were indefinitely suspended in the storyline until Matilda was found. From late January 1988 until early February, the Islanders were consistently beaten by the British Bulldogs. At a Saturday Night's Main Event XV on March 7, they beat the Killer Bees, a tag team consisting of Brian Blair and Jim Brunzell. At Wrestlemania 4, the Islanders, with Bobby Heenan, defeated the Bulldogs and Koko B. Ware, with Matilda. On April 21, Heenan introduced Siva Afi as the newest member of the group, but Afi never made another appearance with the Islanders. Fatu then left the WWF. === World Wrestling Council (1989)=== After leaving the WWF, Fatu began performing for the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico as \\"Tama\\". On January 6, 1989, he and Dan Kroffat defeated The Batten Twins to win the WWC World Tag Team Championship. The Batten Twins regained the championship on March 4, 1989. === World Championship Wrestling (1989–1990) === In 1989, Fatu joined World Championship Wrestling, where he adopted the ring name \\"The Samoan Savage\\" and began teaming with his brother Fatu and his cousin Samu as The Samoan SWAT Team. The trio were managed by \\"The Big Kahuna\\" Oliver Humperdink. In late 1989, Samu withdrew from in-ring competition and The Samoan SWAT Team was renamed \\"The New Wild Samoans\\". At Starrcade in December 1989, The New Wild Samoans competed in the Iron Team round-robin tournament, placing third. The New Wild Samoans left WCW in the summer of 1990. === Later career (1990–2011) === After leaving WCW, Fatu (wrestling as \\"The Samoan Savage\\") journeyed to Mexico to perform for the Universal Wrestling Association along with his brother Fatu and his cousin, The Great Kokina. Billed as \\"The Hawaiian Beasts\\", the trio won the UWA World Trios Championship from Los Villanos on April 7, 1991. Los Villanos regained the championship on May 31, 1991. Fatu competed on the independent circuit until retiring in 2011. In 2005 and 2006, he wrestled in Italy with the Nu Wrestling Evolution promotion. == Other media == Fatu appeared as \\"The Tonga Kid\\" in the opening scene of the 1986 film Highlander, where he was involved in a six-man tag team match with Greg Gagne and Jim Brunzell against The Fabulous Freebirds at the Meadowlands Arena. He also starred as \\"Tonga Tom\\" in the 1987 wrestling film Body Slam, along with Dirk Benedict and Roddy Piper. Fatu was featured in an April 2020 documentary for Vice's Dark Side of the Ring series, revealing new information on the May 1983 homicide of Nancy Argentino. == Personal life == Fatu is a member of the famous Anoaʻi family.

Samuel is the father of Jacob Fatu, who currently wrestles for Major League Wrestling (MLW). In November 2008, Fatu's wife, Theresa Fuavai-Fatu, went into cardiac arrest while giving birth. Her heart stopped completely before the twins, Marley and Myracle, could be delivered by Caesarean section, but she was spontaneously revived and eventually recovered. This type of incident is very rare, with one of the cardiac surgeons who was working on Theresa saying that he had never seen surviving mothers or babies. Sam is the older brother of Eddie Fatu (Umaga/Jamal), who died of a heart attack on December 4, 2009. Other members of the family in professional wrestling include Solafa's twin sons, Jonathan and Joshua Samuel, who currently wrestle in WWE as Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso,California birthsCalifornia birthsCalifornia births and his cousins in wrestling are Rodney Anoaʻi (Yokozuna), Samula Anoaʻi (Headshrinker Samu), Matt Anoaʻi (Rosey), Joe Anoaʻi (Roman Reigns), Reno Anoaʻi (Black Pearl), Afa Anoaʻi Jr. (Manu), and Lloyd Anoaʻi (L.A.

It was first published in 1987. It is the fourth book to be published after the death of René Goscinny and is thus both written and drawn by Albert Uderzo alone. The full original French title was Astérix chez Rahàzade ou Le compte des mille et une heures (Asterix meets Orinjade or the 1001 Hours Countdown), a reference to Queen Scheherazade who tells the famous 1001 Arabian Nights collection of stories. ==Plot summary== Following the rebuilding of the Gaulish village after Brutus' attack in the previous story, Chief Vitalstatistix is trying to give a speech, when he is interrupted by the bard Cacofonix, whose song causes rain. This introduces Watziznehm the fakir, who falls from his flying carpet. Watziznehm explains he was searching for the village because he needs to make it rain in his country, a kingdom in the Ganges Valley, within the following 1001 hours, otherwise Princess Orinjade, daughter of Rajah Wotzit, will be sacrificed to the gods. This prophecy is part of an evil scheme by Grand Vizier Hoodunnit, to seize the throne. Vitalstatistix agrees to send the rain-making Cacofonix to India, accompanied by Asterix, Obelix, and Dogmatix. All five mount the flying carpet; but their journey is often interrupted either by Obelix's insistence on stopping for food, by Cacofonix's attempts to sing, and once by a lightning strike which forces them to replace the carpet. The Gauls eventually arrive in India with exactly 30 hours, 30 minutes, and 30 seconds to save Orinjade; but Cacofonix has lost his voice during the journey, and Rajah Wotzit's doctors proclaim that to regain his voice, Cacofonix must take an overnight bath in a combination of elephant milk, dung and hair. Accordingly, the Gauls and Watziznehm take Cacofonix to elephant-trainer Howdoo and set up the bath; but Hoodunnit sends his henchmen to kidnap the bard and take him to an elephants' graveyard to be trampled by the wild elephant herd. Watziznehm, Asterix and Obelix set out to rescue the bard, but they are stopped by Owzat, Hoodunnit's fakir sidekick. While Watziznehm and Owzat curse each other, Asterix and Obelix escape to Howdoo, with whom they embark to the elephants' graveyard. After delays by tigers, monkeys, a rhinoceros and Hoodunnit's henchmen, they find Cacofonix alive and well, his smell having placated the elephants. Meanwhile, Watziznehm defeats Owzat and recovers the Gauls on his flying carpet. At the execution grounds, Asterix saves Orinjade, while Watziznehm intercepts Hoodunnit. Cacofonix recovers his voice after a dose of magic potion, and sings, causing rain. At the victory feast in the palace, Obelix surmises that his fellow villagers might be having their customary banquet, this time without him. This is proven true; and at the banquet, some of the Gauls begin to express a desire to retrieve the bard, in fear of a drought, and Fulliautomatix the blacksmith, Cacofonix's habitual menace, appears to be missing him. ==Introducing== * Watziznehm – the fakir * Wotzit – the rajah * Orinjade – the princess * Hoodunnit – the scheming Grand Vizier * Owzat – Hoodunnit's fakir henchman * Howdoo – the elephant man ==Notes== * An audiobook of Asterix and the Magic Carpet adapted by Anthea Bell and narrated by Willie Rushton was released on EMI Records Listen for Pleasure label in 1988. * This is the first reference to India in an Asterix book. Although some things are depicted in historical fashion (the Rigvedic deities, for example), many of the architectural details and styles of clothing are distinctly Islamic, as is the concept of a fakir. Islam was not brought to India until the late 11th century CE. * As in Asterix in Switzerland and Asterix and Son, this volume has a rare dramatic overtone by the heroes' need to rescue an innocent from impending death. * Orinjade's name is a play on the soft drink Orangeade. In the original French version the princess is called Rahàzade. The title of the comic is thus; \\"Astérix chez Rahàzade\\" (\\"Asterix meets Rahàzade\\"): a pun on the famous storyteller Scheherazade who told the 1001 Arabian nights stories. * The gag that Cacofonix' singing induces rain was used for the first time in this book. The gag appears later in Asterix and the Secret Weapon. * When Cacofonix sings in Vitalstatistix' hut, it begins to rain indoors (causing an angry Impedimenta to chase them outside). However, when he first sings in his own hut, it rains all over the village. (This can possibly be explained by Cacofonix sticking his head out a rear window of his hut, although the illustrations do not state this explicitly.) * In the original French version Cacofonix (on page 18) starts singing a song \\"confused with another comic strip\\", according to the accompanying text. The song is indeed Bianca Castafiore's famous aria from Charles Gounod's Faust, which she sings often in the Belgian comic strip The Adventures of Tintin. * On page 23, the princess asks her handmaiden (named \\"Lemuhnade\\" in the English translation) \\"if she sees anything arriving\\", while awaiting the Gauls' arrival. This a reference to the fairy tale of Bluebeard where Bluebeard's wife asks the same thing of her sister, while waiting for her brothers to rescue her. * On page 29 Asterix, Obelix and Cacofonix eat caviar, just a meal for \\"poor people\\", according to the cooks. This is a reference to the fact that nowadays only rich people eat it. * When Cacofonix sings in his own hut, after Watziznehm has crash-landed in the village, the song is Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head by B.J. Thomas. *Hoodunnit makes a reference to another Goscinny character, Iznogoud, as his cousin and borrows his catchphrase by declaring that he will be Rajah instead of the Rajah. (page 43) * Upon recovering his voice, Cacofonix sings Singin' in the Rain by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown. (In the English translation, he instead performs Feste's Song from Shakespeare's Twelfth Night.) * Orinjade is one of the few to express a liking for Cacofonix's music; the others being Justforkix in Asterix and the Normans and Pepe in Asterix in Spain. * When Owzat stops Watziznehm from passing, Obelix says \\"Not out\\": a reference to the sport of cricket, wherein thus bowlers appeal to the umpire. Cricket is extremely popular in India. * When Orinjade is taken to be executed, the public call out the countdown, and Asterix and Co. rescue the princess when the count reaches zero; a reference to the development of the number zero in ancient India. ==In other languages== *Ancient Greek: Αστερίκιος παρά Σακχαραζάδι *Catalan: Astèrix a l'Índia *Croatian: Asterix i leteći sag *Czech: Asterix a Rahazáda *Danish: Asterix i Østens fagre riger *Dutch: Asterix in Indus-land *Finnish: Asterix Intiassa – Tuhannen ja yhden tunnin matka (Asterix in India – The Thousand-and-One-Hour Journey) *German: Asterix im Morgenland *Greek: Ο Αστερίξ και η Χαλαλίμα *Indonesian: \\"Asterix dan Putri Rahazade\\" *Italian: Le mille e un'ora di Asterix *Latin Asterix Orientalis *Norwegian: Asterix og det flygende teppet *Polish: Asteriks u Reszehezady *Portuguese: As 1001 horas de Astérix *Russian: Астерикс и Волшебный ковер *Serbian: Астерикс и летећи ћилим *Spanish: Astérix en la India *Swedish: Asterix i Indien == Reception == On Goodreads, it has a score of 3.91 out of 5. ==ReferencesExternal links== *Astérix chez Rahazade annotations *Official English Website Category:1987 graphic novels Magic Carpet, Asterix and the Category:India in fiction Category:Comics set in India Category:Comics by Albert Uderzo Category:Comics based on fairy tales Category:Works based on One Thousand and One Nights Category:Depictions of Julius Caesar in comics ","title":"Asterix and the Magic Carpet"},{"id":"2204397","text":"Bryan Morel \\"Bitsy\\" Grant Jr. (December 25, 1909 – June 5, 1986) was an American amateur tennis champion. At 5 feet 4 inches (162 cm) and 120 lbs (54 kg), Grant was the smallest American man to win a championship on the international tennis circuit. A right-handed retriever, he was able to beat heavy-hitting greats such as Don Budge and Ellsworth Vines even when playing on grass. His nickname was \\"Itsy Bitsy the Giant Killer\\". At a young age, Grant was already a star in football, basketball and tennis at local Atlanta schools. In 1929, he won the Georgia state (GIAA) tennis title. Grant had gained national stature in tennis long before his graduation from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1933. During World War II, he served in the Pacific Islands as a US Army Rifleman in and around Papua New Guinea. His letters to his future wife attest that he fought out of a foxhole for several months, and saw heavy and repeated firefights. Grant was a member of the Piedmont Driving Club. Grant died at the age of 76 at his home he shared with his sister, Harriet Keyes Grant behind Lovett School in Townsend Place. He was survived by his sister, Harriet, his son Bryan M. Grant III, his daughter, Mary (Grant) McDonald, and his three grandchildren, Bryan M. \\"Beau\\" Grant IV, Jeffrey Bryan McDonald, and Christopher McDonald. ==Tennis career== Between 1930 and 1941, Grant was ranked nine times in the U.S Top Ten (USLTA). He was third in 1935 and second in 1936 (USLTA). A. Wallis Myers of The Daily Telegraph ranked Grant World No. 6 in 1937 and World No. 8 in 1936.\\"Wallis Myers' Rankings\\", The Age, 24th September 1936. Grant won 8 of 11 tournaments entered in 1935, and did not lose one match on clay courts. He won the U.S. Clay Court Championships thrice (1930, 1934, 1935). Grant reached the U.S. semifinals in 1935 by defeating second-seeded Don Budge, before losing to Sidney Wood- and in 1936, he lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Fred Perry. He was a quarterfinalist in 1937, losing to Gottfried von Cramm, and reached the same round a year later. Grant was a standout on the Davis Cup team in 1935, 1936 and 1937, helping the U.S. regain the prize in 1937 after a 10-year slump. At this time he also defeated in major tournaments Don Budge, Frank Shields, and Wilmer Allison. He reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 1936 and 1937, losing to Fred Perry and Bunny Austin. Also in 1937, Grant and Wayne Sabin were the 3rd-ranked U.S. doubles team. He also won the singles and the doubles titles at the tournament in Cincinnati in both 1939 and 1933. Frank Shields, who had had his issues both with interactions with other players, and with alcohol, was known for making fun of Grant, saying \\"the little shaver\\" was hiding behind the net. Once a drunk Shields held Grant upside down, outside a hotel window. Grant continued to compete as a senior, winning 19 U.S. singles titles on the four surfaces: grass court-45s (1956 and 1957), 55s (1965, 1966, 1967 and 1968); indoor 55s (1966); clay court-45s (1959, 1960, 1961 and 1963), 55s (1965, 1966, 1967, 1968 and 1969), 65s (1976 and 1977); and hard court-65s (1976). Atlanta's largest tennis center, the Bitsy Grant Tennis Center, was named for him in 1954.

He died in a plane crash. ==Early life== Eduardo Corrochio was born in Spain in 1869, the only son of Miguel and Regina Corrochio. His mother Regina was half English, having been fathered by a British Colonel. His early life has been poorly documented. It seems that his family was part of the poor farming class that lived on the shrinking agricultural land that bordered the city of Madrid. He was accepted into Spanish gymnastics school at the age of seven, where he caught the eye of an instructor by the name of Damiano Tutador. Damiano saw the makings of a great dancer in young Eduardo. Eduardo was accepted into The Capablanca school of dance in the centre of Madrid. To raise money for his entrance his parents Miguel and Regina had to sell their inherited property. A sense of indebtedness plagued Eduardo for most of his adult life. He felt chained to his parents by feelings of deep guilt and obligation. This posed a special problem when his dancing ambition eventually brought him to the United States of America to study under the tap dancing legend Bernie Howard. Eduardo's immigration to America alienated him from his parents, something he writes about in his auto-biography \\"Soul of a Tap Dancer\\". ==Career== 1890- Corrochio entered the Tap Dancing Championship in New York city.

The difference between a street elbow and a regular elbow is the gender of its two connections. A regular elbow has a hub or female-threaded connection on each end, so it can join two male pipes. Instead, a street elbow has a female fitting on one end and a male fitting on the other. The advantage of the street elbow is that it can be connected directly to another fitting without having to use an additional short connecting piece (a pipe nipple). ==Applications== Street elbows are available with bend angles of 90°, 45°, and 22.5°. They can be used in many plumbing applications, including water supply, drainage, sewers, vents, central vacuum systems, compressed air and gas lines, HVAC, sump pump drains, and other locations where plumbing fittings would be used to join sections of pipe. Plumbing codes regulate the use of street elbows.

He is one of the writers and stars of the hit CBBC comedy shows Sorry, I've Got No Head, and Pixelface. He has also written for shows such as The Peter Serafinowicz Show and Katy Brand's Big Ass Show. ==Early life and career== Born in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering, Armand was educated at Latimer Community Arts College, St Catharine's College, Cambridge and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. As a member of the sketch comedy troupe The Hollow Men, he appeared at the Edinburgh Fringe four times between 1999 and 2002, travelled to America as a participant at the 2003 US Comedy Arts Festival in the Colorado mountain resort of Aspen, and to Canada for a performance at Montreal's 2005 Just for Laughs festival. The troupe wrote and starred in their self-titled TV series for the American network Comedy Central as well as two series for BBC Radio 4. He is well known for his mime style interpretive dance of Natalie Imbruglia's \\"Torn\\" (in character as \\"Austrian interpretive dance artist Johann Lippowitz\\"). A 2005 performance was broadcast by HBO Comedy and subsequently spread through the Internet. The performance is often incorrectly labelled as \\"Karaoke for the Deaf\\". He performed his famous dance on stage live with Natalie Imbruglia at the 2006 Secret Policeman's Ball for Amnesty International. The performance started with Armand dancing with Imbruglia singing live vocals backstage, then on-stage, and concluded with Imbruglia performing Armand's dance moves alongside him. Utilizing the \\"Johann Lippowitz\\" alter ego, he has performed several other songs, including Paul Young's \\"Wherever I Lay My Hat\\". and \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" by Oasis. Armand starred in BBC Three sitcom, How Not to Live Your Life as Eddie Singh, the over-enthusiastic caregiver for the late grandmother of the show's leading character, Don Danbury (Dan Clark). He has also appeared in several online BBC comedy sketches under the title This is Wondervision. In 2011 he appeared on BBC2's improv show Fast and Loose, where he performed an interpretive dance routine to a different song each week. Two cast members had to guess the song title based on his routine. In February 2012 Armand appeared as John in Alan Ayckbourn's Absent Friends at the Harold Pinter Theatre, London, receiving a positive review from Michael Billington. In July 2012, he made regular appearances on the American TV show Trust Us with Your Life on ABC, performing interpretive dance to a popular song related to some aspect of the guest celebrity on that week's show, which the celebrity (wearing noise-cancelling headphones) was challenged to guess. He appeared in Comedy at the Hippodrome with Ardal O'Hanlon and Adam Kay in 2017. ==References * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of St Catharine's College, Cambridge Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:English male television actors Category:English male comedians Category:English comedy writers Category:People from Kettering Category:20th-century English comedians Category:21st-century English comedians Category:Comedians from Northamptonshire ","title":"David Armand"},{"id":"2204466","text":"State Route 592 (SR 592) is a east-west highway section line arterial in the Las Vegas Valley.

It contains exhibit rooms and an observation deck, and since 1919, has also housed the official Central Park weather station. Belvedere Castle was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in 1867–1869. An architectural hybrid of Gothic and Romanesque styles, Vaux's design called for a Manhattan schist and granite structure with a corner tower with conical cap, with the existing lookout over parapet walls between them.The design, published in a lithograph, is illustrated in . Its name comes from belvedere, which means \\"beautiful view\\" in Italian. ==Design== The tower in February 2005; note the anemometer and wind vane on the top; these instruments record the official wind speed and direction for Central Park Belvedere Castle was originally built as a shell with open doorway and window openings. The main tower was given a more medieval design, with a weather antenna on top, but during the castle's 1983 renovation, the tower was restored to a German style with a flag, a weather vane, and an anemometer on top. The two fanciful wooden pavilions deteriorated without painting and upkeep and were removed before 1900.Ca. 1900 photograph in illustration. Starting in 1919, Belvedere Castle housed the New York Meteorological Observatory, which had been taken over by the [National Weather ServiceUnited States Weather Bureau]. The current weather station in Central Park, an Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), is located immediately south of the castle, though wind equipment is still located on the main tower.\\"Belvedere Castle\\", New York City Department of Parks and Recreation The castle caps Vista Rock, a outcropping of schist and the park's second-highest natural elevation. (Summit Rock, at 83rd Street overlooking Central Park West, is higher at .) Constructed of Manhattan schist quarried in the park and dressed with gray granite, it tops the natural-looking woodlands of The Ramble, as seen from the formal Bethesda Terrace. The natural rock was tunneled through for the innovative sunken transverse roadway that still carries commercial and other traffic unobtrusively through the park. The castle serves now as a visitor center and gift shop. Free family and community programs hosted at Belvedere Castle include birding and other Central Park Conservancy discovery programs for families as well as a variety of history and natural history programs led by NYC Urban Park Rangers, including stargazing/astronomy and wildlife-education events. The eastern elevation formerly faced a rectangular receiving reservoir that was part of the Croton Aqueduct system. The reservoir was filled in with city building rubble, beginning with spoil from construction of the New York City Subway's IND Eighth Avenue Line (now carrying the ) in the 1930s. Today, the eastern elevation overlooks the Great Lawn and Turtle Pond, which occupies the former site of the receiving reservoir. ==History== Mould's bronze cockatrice, part of a transom over a doorway of the Castle in 2004 The castle was designed by the architects Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould as an additional feature of the Greensward Plan, created by Vaux and Frederick Law Olmsted. Olmsted and Vaux were re- hired to their positions in mid-1865 after quitting abruptly several years before. In 1867, Vaux decided to develop this area by building Belvedere Castle on the top of the rock, overlooking the Croton Reservoir.Vista Rock, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation The site already held a fire tower under the control of the Croton Aqueduct board, and so the fire tower was demolished. The original plans for Belvedere Castle called for two turreted stone towers: a larger structure on the eastern elevation and a smaller structure on the west side. To reduce costs it was revised in November 1870 under the Tammany Hall regime, which had taken over construction by this time, and completed as an open painted-wood pavilion. The eastern structure was completed by 1871, while the western structure was never built. As the plantings matured, the castle has been obscured from its original intended viewpoint. Its turret is the highest point in the park.CityListen Audio Tours, Central Park: An Urban Marvel After the New York Meteorological Observatory automated its equipment and moved its offices to Rockefeller Center in the 1960s, Belvedere Castle was closed to the public and became an object of much vandalism, neglect and deterioration. The Central Park Conservancy launched a restoration effort and reopened the structure on May 1, 1983. The original turret was replaced, the pavilions were rebuilt, and the castle was converted into a visitor center. In 1995, the Conservancy's Historic Preservation Crew replaced the painted wooden loggia of the castle, working from Vaux's designs, on the granite piers and walls that had survived. The same year, a $340,000 grant was distributed toward restoring the castle as the Henry Luce Nature Center. That restoration was completed in 1996. In 2018, the Central Park Conservancy conducted a second renovation of Belvedere Castle. Plans included replacing existing doors and windows with double paned glass. In addition the Conservancy proposed to construct a new access path to ADA standards from the East Drive.Landmarks Preservation Commission, Presentation Materials, May 2, 2017. The access path − actually an elevated ramp with parapets − has been criticized as creating an unnecessary barrier in the otherwise naturalistic park. Following the $12 million renovation, the castle reopened on June 28, 2019. ==In popular culture== The first season episode of The Naked City titled 'Belvedere Tower', first screened on November 18, 1958, featured location filming at the castle where a killer takes refuge, holding a weather official hostage, and is taken into custody after a shootout with police. In the 1970s, its facade was used for exterior shots of the castle where Count von Count lived on the children's television series Sesame Street. Soon after its 1983 restoration, the building was used as a filming location for Merchant Ivory's 1984 film The Bostonians, starring Christopher Reeve and Vanessa Redgrave. The castle is depicted in animated form twice in season 2 of the American animated series Gargoyles. First in the episode \\"High Noon\\" where it is chosen as the location of the episode's climax and later in the episode \\"Avalon\\" when it's the site of a reunion. It is also featured in the 1998 film Stepmom, as a photography location for Julia Roberts' character. The castle was also used in the 2011 film The Smurfs where it served as both the hiding place of the evil sorcerer Gargamel and the location of the film's final battle. In the \\"DeathSpeaker Codex\\" series by Sonya Bateman, the castle is prominent in many of the books as a place where the protagonist, Gideon, goes back to time and time again for various paranormal reasons. It was featured in the 2018 PlayStation 4 game Spider-Man. ==ReferencesCitations=Sources=== * * ==External links== * Category:1869 establishments in New York (state) Category:Buildings and structures in Manhattan Category:Buildings and structures in New York City Category:Castles in New York (state) Category:Central Park Category:Folly buildings in the United States Category:Nature centers in New York City ","title":"Belvedere Castle"},{"id":"2204492","text":"Martin Grzimek (born 1950) is a German author.

Nelson Island is famous as the disembarkation point and quarantine station for indentured immigrants to Trinidad and Tobago in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. For this reason it has been called the Ellis Island of Trinidad and Tobago. At Nelson Island the Indian immigrants and the ship, food and stores were inspected by the Protector of Immigrants. Their bundles and blankets were fumigated and they were quarantined and allowed to recover and regain strength. This measure was designed to prevent the spread of diseases which might have been transported from India. Special effort was made to stop the spread of smallpox and measles. At Nelson Island, the immigrants were examined by a medical doctor and then transported by small boats to Port of Spain. The healthy ones were immediately sent to estates, the sick ones went to the Colonial Hospital in Port of Spain and those who only needed rest were kept at the Depot in Port of Spain. In the 1930s Nelson Island was used as a detention center for prisoners, among them Tubal Uriah Butler. During World War II, the Americans built a gun emplacement at the eastern end of the island and a causeway to Rock Island to the west. Nelson Island became a detention center again in 1970 following the Black Power Revolution.

Like the closely related true woodcreepers, it is a member of the South American bird family Furnariidae. The streaked xenops is typically 4.8 in (12.2 cm) long, weighs 0.44 oz (12.6 g), and has a stubby wedge-shaped bill. The head is dark brown with a whitish supercilium and malar stripe. The upperparts are brown, becoming rufous on the tail and rump, and there is a buff bar on the darker brown wings. The underparts are white-streaked olive brown. Males and females looks alike. Visually inconspicuous, it is easier located by its chattering call, a series of 5 or 6 metallic zeet notes. It is found in wet forests in foothills and mountains between 2,000-7,200 ft (600-2,200 m) ASL, and will utilize secondary forests and opened-up growth.de L. Fávaro et al. (2006) The streaked xenops is often difficult to see as it forages on bark, rotting stumps or bare twigs; it moves in all directions on the trunk like a treecreeper, but does not use its tail as a prop. It feeds on arthropods such as the larvae of wood-boring beetles, but can also catch flying termites in mid-air.Olson & Alvarenga (2006) It joins mixed-species feeding flocks on a more or less regular basis depending on location, usually moving through the middle levels of the forest.Machado (1999), Olson & Alvarenga (2006) The streaked xenops builds its nest by simply placing a few stems and roots in a hole 5–15 ft (1.5-4.5 m) high in a tree. The normal clutch is two white eggs, incubated by both sexes. ==FootnotesReferences== * de L. Fávaro, Fernando; dos Anjos, Luiz; Lopes, Edson V.; Mendonça, Luciana B. & Volpato, Graziele H.

The route follows Rancho Drive, a major arterial connecting downtown Las Vegas to the northwest part of the city. Much of SR 599 was previously designated as U.S. Route 95 (US 95) prior to completion of the Las Vegas Expressway. The route is also designated as U.S. Route 95 Business (US 95 Bus.). ==Route description== View at the north end of SR 599 looking southbound in 2015 SR 599 begins at the intersection of Rancho Drive and Redondo Avenue in the city of Las Vegas. From there, the route heads north along Rancho Drive to intersect the US 95 freeway (at exit 77). The highway continues heading northwest for several miles, briefly skirting the western edge of North Las Vegas and providing access to the North Las Vegas Airport. The route reaches its northern terminus at the end of Rancho Drive, at the interchange with US 95 north and Ann Road (at exits 90 and 91). US 95 freeway signs for Rancho Drive designate the route as U.S. Route 95 Business, a distinction noted on many maps (including those published by the Nevada Department of Transportation (NDOT)). However, no business route signs are posted along the highway itself and relatively few SR 599 shields can be found on the route. ==History== Rancho Drive originally carried State Route 5 from Bonanza Road (present–day State Route 579) northwest out of Las Vegas towards Tonopah—this destination contributed to the road's alternate name of Tonopah Highway. When US 95 was extended into Nevada in 1940, it was routed concurrently with SR 5 on Rancho Drive. The U.S. route remained on Rancho Drive until it was relocated onto the completed Las Vegas Expressway in the early 1980s. SR 599 was designated along the former US 95/SR 5 at this time, in accordance with the 1976 renumbering of Nevada's State Routes. SR 599 lost mileage between 1996 and 2000. In 2006, the route was pending removal from the state highway system to be transferred to the City of Las Vegas for maintenance, but this has not happened as of January 2008. By October 2011, the southern terminus of SR 599 had been moved from Sahara Avenue to Redondo Avenue, shortening the overall mileage to the current length. ==Major intersectionsPublic transport== RTC Transit Routes 106A, 106B and 119 function on this road. ==References== 599 Category:Streets in Las Vegas Category:Streets in North Las Vegas, Nevada Category:Transportation in Clark County, Nevada Category:Transportation in the Las Vegas Valley Category:U.S. Route 95 ","title":"Nevada State Route 599"},{"id":"2204526","text":"The Cardiff University School of Medicine () is the medical school of Cardiff University and is located in Cardiff, Wales, UK. Founded in 1893 as part of the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, it is the older of the two medical schools in Wales. It is one of the largest medical schools in the United Kingdom, employing nearly 500 academic and 300 support staff; and with over 1000 undergraduate and 1100 postgraduate students enrolled on medical and scientific courses. The school has an annual financial turnover of over £50 million, of which nearly half comes from competitive external research funding. The school is based at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. ==History Origins === The Main Building of Cardiff University The medical school was founded as Cardiff Medical School in 1893 when the Departments of Anatomy, Physiology and Pharmacology were established at University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire (now Cardiff University). The opening ceremony took place on 14 February 1894 at the College buildings on Dumfries Place and was conducted by John Viriamu Jones, Principal of the College, and Richard Quain, President of the General Medical Council. During the ceremony professors of the new medical school encouraged it to emulate the recent advances in medical education at the University of Heidelberg. The first Dean of the school was Alfred W. Hughes of Corris. A department of Pathology and Bacteriology was added in 1910. Students finishing their preclinical studies at Cardiff went on to other medical schools for their clinical studies, many going to University College Hospital in London, part of University College London. === Welsh National School of Medicine === In 1921 it became a clinical and pre-clinical medical school with the name of the Welsh National School of Medicine, and in 1931 it became an independent institution of the University of Wales. The name was further changed in 1984, to University of Wales College of Medicine.The Guardian. Retrieved 14 November 2017. === Re-merger with Cardiff University === The Sir Martin Evans building, which houses pre-clinical teaching at the School of Medicine In 2002, ideas were floated to re-merge Cardiff with the University of Wales College of Medicine (UWCM) following the publication of the Welsh Assembly Government's review of higher education in Wales. This merger became effective on 1 August 2004, on which date Cardiff University ceased to be a constituent institution of the University of Wales and became an independent \\"link institution\\" affiliated to the federal University. The process of the merger was completed on 1 December 2004 when the Act of Parliament transferring UWCM's assets to Cardiff University received Royal Assent. On 17 December it was announced that the Privy Council had given approval to the new Supplemental Charter and had granted university status to Cardiff, legally changing the name of the institution to Cardiff University. Cardiff awarded University of Wales degrees to students admitted before 2005, but these have been replaced by Cardiff degrees. Medicine, dentistry and other health-related areas began to admit students for Cardiff degrees in 2006. In 2004, Cardiff University and the Swansea University entered a partnership to provide a four-year graduate-entry medical degree. An annual intake of around 70 post-graduate students undertook an accelerated version of the Cardiff course at the Swansea University for the first two years before joining undergraduate students at Cardiff for the final two years. However, from September 2010 Swansea University began independently providing medical education in a revised 4-yr Graduate Entry Degree. In 2005, The Wales College of Medicine, which is part of the University, launched the North Wales Clinical School in Wrexham in collaboration with the North East Wales Institute of Higher Education in Wrexham and Bangor University, previously University of Wales, Bangor, and with the National Health Service in Wales. This has been funded with £12.5 million from the Welsh Assembly and will lead to the trebling of the number of trainee doctors in clinical training in Wales over a four-year period. By 2008 the medical school it had an intake of some 305 British medical students per year and an additional 25 students from overseas. In November 2011 Cardiff University’s School of Medicine officially opened the Cochrane Building, a health education centre offering students the latest teaching, library and simulation facilities. The Centre's facilities include a Clinical Skills Centre, a high-technology medical simulation centre and a new library. The Cochrane Building provides teaching and learning facilities for all healthcare schools based on the Heath Park Campus and is named after the University’s medical pioneer, Archie Cochrane. In 2012, Cardiff University’s School of Medicine and 'Meducation' hosted the Wales Medical Undergraduate Conference, the first national undergraduate medical conference held in Wales,Lemon TI, Cooksey F, Smith R (2012) \\"WMUC - Encouraging medical student research and interaction\\", Cardiff University, (Classmark 610.7) with over 100 posters, and 15 oral presentations taking placeYarrow Jenkins et al (2012) \\"First Wales Medical Undergraduate Conference\\", Cambridge Medicine Journal and attendees from throughout Europe.Cserharti Z (2012) \\"First Medical Undergraduate Conference\\" Telemedicine and e-Health ==Curriculum== The gardens at the Heath Park site The school’s major undergraduate programme is the MBBCh in Medicine. Clinical placements occurs in partnership with over a dozen NHS Trusts and over 150 general practices, covering the whole of Wales. C21 Curriculum In 2013, Cardiff School of Medicine launched a major redevelopment of its undergraduate medical education programme. C21 resulted from a comprehensive review of the undergraduate curriculum, its delivery and the supporting structures, mechanisms and processes and improve the quality of the medical education delivered at Cardiff University. Led by the Division of Medical Education, and in partnership with colleagues from across the University, student and patient representatives, the NHS and Welsh Assembly Government, C21 consisted of 5 coordinated projects. Intercalated programmes Some undergraduate students have the opportunity to undertake an intercalated year at the end of Year 3 or Year 4 of the course. Post-graduate taught (PGT) schemes A wide range of post- graduate taught (PGT) schemes is also offered. The school is the largest provider of medically related PGT courses in the UK. These include both conventional and distance learning courses. Many courses are aimed specifically at qualified doctors and health care professionals, such as the Diploma in Practical Dermatology and the MSc in Psychiatry. ==Research institutes== The Children's Hospital for Wales at the Heath Park site Across the school, five institutes lead research that covers a spectrum from basic laboratory science to bedside practice. These are the Institute of Psychological Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, the Institute of Infection & Immunity, the Institute of Primary Care & Public Health, the Institute of Cancer & Genetics, and the Institute of Molecular & Experimental Medicine. Alongside these research Institutes, core functions of the school are provided by the Institute of Medical Education and the Institute of Translation, Innovation, Methodology & Engagement (TIME). Research facilities have recently been enhanced with the £11m Henry Wellcome Building for Biomedical Research in Wales. The building includes 4500 square metres of laboratories and equipment for research into Infection & Immunity, Cancer Biology and Psychiatric Genetics, adjacent to a purpose-built Clinical Research Facility. The Henry Wellcome Building is the largest development of its kind ever undertaken in Wales. Notable recent successes include the establishment of a Medical Research Council-funded translational research collaboration with Bristol University (called SARTRE), and the award of an MRC Centre in Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics– the first MRC Centre in Wales and the first aimed specifically at harnessing the genetics revolution for research in mental disorders. The school also houses the Institute of Medical Genetics, winner of a 2007 Queen's Anniversary Prize.Royal Anniversary Trust == Clubs and societies == Cardiff University medical students are able to join both all the Cardiff University clubs and societies, and also clubs and societies run specifically for students studying medicine, and in some cases other healthcare sciences. These clubs and societies are run by Cardiff Medsoc which is the Medsoc within Cardiff University Students' Union. ==Alumni and faculty== Glyn Elwyn There are many distinguished alumni of the Cardiff University School of Medicine. These include; === Staff === *Archie Cochrane, pioneer of scientific method in medicine *Stephen Dunnett, neuroscientist *Alun Davies, biologist === Students === * Sir Clement Price Thomas, surgeon for George VI * Thomas Lewis, pioneer of Electrocardiography *Raman Viswanathan, pioneer of Chest Medicine in India and Padma Bhushan awardee * Sir Keith Peters, Regius Professor of Physic at the University of Cambridge * Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, 345th Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge * Annapoorna Kini, a cardiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, has the distinction of performing more coronary interventions annually than any other woman in the U.S. * Alice Roberts, clinical anatomist *Glyn Elwyn, health services research and current Dartmouth College Professor *Muzlifah Haniffa, professor of immunology and dermatology at Newcastle University Alumni have also gone onto success in professional sports, such as Wales international rugby union players Jamie Roberts, Hallam Amos, and Gwyn Jones (the latter captained Wales whilst at medical school). Cardiff has two Nobel Laureates on its staff, Sir Martin Evans and Robert Huber. A number of Cardiff University staff have been elected as Fellows of the Royal Society, these include Graham Hutchings, professor of Physical Chemistry and Director of the Cardiff Catalysis Institute, School of Chemistry and Ole Holger Petersen, director of Cardiff School of Biosciences. ==Notable incidentsExamination errors, August 2009=== In August 2009, the General Medical Council asked the School of Medicine to carry out a full investigation after serious errors were made in the qualifying Final MB Examination. One student, who was told he/she had failed was found to have passed after an appeal. The appeals process revealed that 4 students had been told they had passed the examination but, in fact, had failed. The 4 had already gone through the graduation process and had been registered as doctors by the General Medical Council. They were subsequently suspended from practice. This was said to be due to a \\"clerical error\\". ===Investigation into research misconduct, September 2012=== Following allegations of research misconduct in 2012, a formal investigation was launched into the laboratory of the dean of medicine, Paul Morgan. The formal investigation panel, after a six-month investigation, cleared the dean and his colleagues of the charges, though four allegations of image manipulation against a former member of staff were upheld. Two retractions were published on 7 November 2013 in the journal \\"Cancer Research\\". A retraction of another paper was published in the Journal of Immunology in 2011. A 2014 retraction, the 4th, has been published in the journal Molecular Immunology. ===Anaphylaxis Incident=== In June 2016, a complaint was received by the School of Medicine regarding a student comedy revue, entitled Anaphylaxis. An investigation was carried out by the former President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, Dinesh Bhugra, and subsequently reported that a number of students had been involved in an impersonation of a lecturer at the school through 'Black face', which was both racist and homophobic in nature. http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/551837/Prof-Dinesh- Bhugra-report-Final.pdf ==See also== *Medical education *Medical school in the United Kingdom *List of medical schools in the United Kingdom == References Bibliography== * * * ==External links== *Cardiff University School of Medicine's official website *Cardiff Institute of Infection and Immunity *MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetic & Genomics Category:Medical schools in Wales Medicine, School of Category:1893 establishments in Wales Category:Educational institutions established in 1893 ","title":"Cardiff University School of Medicine"},{"id":"2204528","text":"Zipper Interactive was an American video game developer based in Redmond, Washington and part of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios.

Composed by Academy Award-winning composer Bill Conti (with lyrics from UCLA students Barbara Lamb and Don Holley), the song was commissioned by the UCLA Alumni Association on its fiftieth anniversary. It debuted in 1984 at the football game against Stanford University, with the school marching band conducted by Conti himself. UCLA uses the song as its \\"victory march\\"; it is usually played whenever the team scores. As with UCLA's other fight song, Bruin Warriors, the Mighty Bruins prominently features the UCLA Eight Clap cheer. ==Other UCLA fight songs== One of the reasons for commissioning the song was to give UCLA its own fight song, separate from the University of California, Berkeley. UCLA has used Sons of Westwood, taken from the Cal Big C tune, as its best known fight song since the All-California football weekends. Another of the reasons for the commissioning was to replace some other lesser known UCLA fight songs such as \\"Sing U.C.L.A.\\", \\"By the Old Pacific's Rolling Waters\\", \\"Team, Hear our Song\\", and \\"Fight on Men of Westwood\\". *\\"Fight on Men of Westwood\\", simply known as \\"Fight\\", uses the tune \\"Fight on, Pennsylvania!\\", a fight song of the University of Pennsylvania. It was written by David B. Zoob. Until the 1986 football season, \\"Fight\\" was played following a UCLA touchdown. *\\"By the Old Pacific's Rolling Waters\\", or more simply \\"By\\", was written in 1948 specifically for UCLA by Thomas V. Beall. *\\"Sing UCLA\\" was written by Irving Bibo and appears on a number of recorded college football song compilations. *\\"Team, Hear Our Song\\", simply known as \\"Team\\" has words by Don Davis, music by Harry Fillmore. *\\"Strike Up the Band for UCLA\\" was another leitmotif of the school teams from the time it was donated to the school by George and Ira Gershwin in 1936. Although the UCLA Band no longer performs \\"Fight on Men of Westwood\\", \\"Team, Hear Our Song\\", or \\"Sing UCLA\\" (\\"By The Old Pacific\\" is still heard occasionally, and is featured on the official band CDs), they are a part of the musical repertoire performed by the UCLA Alumni Band as part of their pre-game concert during every home game. ==Other UCLA school songs== *Hail to the Hills of Westwood - UCLA Alma Mater song *Rover (song) - UCLA Victory song *Strike Up The Band (song) - UCLA official song *Bruin Warriors ==References== * ==External links== *Lyrics Category:UCLA Bruins Category:Pac-12 Conference fight songs Category:American college songs ","title":"Mighty Bruins"},{"id":"2204533","text":"Aquatic Park may refer to: *Aquatic Park (Berkeley) in Berkeley, California, United States *Aquatic Park Historic District in San Francisco, California, United States *Aquatic Park (Toronto) in Toronto, Canada ","title":"Aquatic Park"},{"id":"2204536","text":"The Right to Read is a short story by Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation, which was first published in 1997 in Communications of the ACM.

The game is based on Chaosium's roleplaying game Call of Cthulhu, which is set in the Cthulhu mythos of H.P. Lovecraft and other horror writers. The game's second edition was released by Fantasy Flight Games in 2005, with a third edition in 2018. ==Overview== The game board is set in Lovecraft's fictional Massachusetts town of Arkham in 1926. Street, building and outdoor locations are featured. Gates to other planes open throughout the town (represented by tokens placed on the board.) Players take on the role of investigators, represented by a character card. Each investigator has several attributes (such as \\"sanity\\"), and cards representing items, spells, and other things. The investigators travel through the city, avoiding or fighting the monsters that enter through the gates, visiting city locations to acquire tools, and ultimately entering the gates. After traveling to the other world and returning, the investigator can try to close the gate. While exploring city locations or other worlds, the investigators face random events which may benefit or harm them. As gates open, a \\"Doom Track\\" advances; if the track reaches its end, a powerful horrific creature known as the Ancient One breaks through into Arkham. In the 1987 edition of the game, this ends the game, and all players lose. In the second edition, when the doom track fills, this typically begins a final opportunity for the players to directly defeat the creature and win; otherwise they lose. ==History== Arkham Horror was originally submitted to Chaosium Inc. by Richard Launius as Call of Cthulhu: The Board Game, a new strategic game based on their Call of Cthulhu role-playing game. It was edited in-house by Chaosium, who added such features as the Doom Track, a method to track progress toward the total failure of the players, and was published in 1987 as Arkham Horror. The game won the \\"Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1987\\" award in the Origins Awards, becoming the first Lovecraft themed board game to achieve significant popularity. Arkham Horror was one of several Lovecraft-based board games submitted by Launius, with other designs from the same period including 'The Trail of the Brotherhood', 'DreamQuests', and 'Imprisoned with the Pharaohs'. Arkham Horror was the only of these games to see professional publication. The original printing of Arkham Horror sold out. Chaosium announced reprints several times, but they never occurred, and Chaosium discontinued production of the game in 1991. In 2004 online game company Skotos acquired the rights to Arkham Horror from Richard Launius, and later arranged publication with Fantasy Flight Games. The game underwent several revisions in this process. Skotos reorganized many of the elements in the game for improved cohesion and arranged for it to more carefully follow the maps of Arkham created by Chaosium and used in their own Lovecraft Country: Arkham by Night online game. Launius added several new elements, including clue tokens and some rearrangements to the decks of cards. Finally, Kevin Wilson at Fantasy Flight massively revamped the game, throwing out a roll-and-move system as well as other concepts and also expanding much of the gameplay. The 2005 edition shares art and other elements with Fantasy Flight Games' other Cthulhu Mythos-based game: Call of Cthulhu Collectible Card Game. The new edition was released in July 2005 and sold out, with a second reprinting also being released in 2005. In early 2011, Fantasy Flight released Elder Sign, a game based on Arkham Horror but which provides a much faster paced alternative. By streamlining many of Arkham Horror's mechanics and using dice to solve encounters, games of Elder Sign lasts 90 minutes on average, rather than 2–4 hours. In 2016 at Arkham Nights, a celebration of Cthulhu games by Fantasy Flight Games, the original designer Richard Launius returned to host a special event using a modified version of the original game. Multiple games were held over the course of the weekend. In November 2019, Aconyte Books announced a-tie in novels based on the world of Arkham Horror, titled Arkham Horror: Wrath of N’Kai. The novel is set to be published in May 2020. ==1987 edition== The box cover of the 1987 edition of Arkham Horror The 1987 version of Arkham Horror has the following game components: a board map of the town of Arkham; 99 playing cards with various events; 50 monster counters; two 4-page investigator rules sheets; eight investigator cards; eight pawns; and markers. The cards and tokens are illustrated with black and white drawings and silhouettes. The map of Arkham consists of a set of intertwined routes with a large number of spaces. There are several locations off the routes, such as Miskatonic University or Dark's Carnival, where a player's investigator may have encounters, or where a gate to another world may appear. The other worlds themselves are in a row at the top of the game board. Encounter events in Arkham are determined by rolling a die and consulting a table for that location. Investigators usually move a random number of spaces based on the roll of two six-sided dice. The investigator cards are pre-made, with four fixed attributes: Fast Talk, Fight, Knowledge, and Sneak. To successfully use an attribute, the player rolls one six-sided die to get a value equal or below the attribute's value. Paperclips are used to track two numbers that frequently change: Sanity and Strength. The turns of the investigators are preceded by the \\"Mythos Phase\\", where a gate and monsters may appear. Monsters that appear move throughout the town, attacking any investigators they happen upon; seeing some monsters results in a sanity loss. In true Lovecraft fashion, if an investigator in the town loses all Sanity or Strength, they are ignored by the monsters. The collapsed investigator is transported to the Sanitarium or Hospital, as appropriate, for treatment. Such vital losses in the other worlds result in the death of the investigator, and the player must start a new one. For each new gate that opens, the Doom Counter increases by one; the \\"Doom of Arkham\\" occurs if the Doom Counter reaches 14. If this happens, all players lose. Victory is achieved by closing all of the gates that have opened. Closing a gate requires passing into it to another world, and taking two encounters there; upon return to Arkham, the investigator must attack the gate successfully to close it. Closing a gate reduces the Doom Counter by one. ===Reception=== In the April 1991 edition of Dragon (Issue 168), Ken Rolston called the game his \\"first choice for a board game with [fantasy role-playing game] feel. It has everything I want in this respect.\\" Rolston was saddened that Chaosium had just discontinued production, saying, \\"If you see a copy of this gem, buy it. Period.\\" ==2005 editionGameplay=== A game of Arkham Horror being played in Prague in 2012 Each player selects an investigator character that is provided with the game. These characters have three pairs of statistics to represent their strengths and weaknesses, and the ability to \\"slide\\" their current focus on each scale towards either extreme or keep it relatively average. For example, Lore and Luck is one pair - if you maximize your character's Lore, you simultaneously minimize his or her Luck. Characters are further defined by a starting inventory and special abilities. Most importantly, each character has the stats of Sanity and Stamina. These respectively measure the character's mental stability and physical health (i.e. hit points). The back of each card includes a brief history for the character, in case players wish to add an element of roleplaying to the game. Each player's character is placed on the game board at the location specified on their card. They are given any items specified as well as their starting Sanity and Stamina tokens. At this time, the players should also pick which Ancient One they will be attempting to defeat. This is usually done by randomly drawing the Ancient One's card, but can also be selected intentionally if the players choose to do so. The basic resolution mechanic is to roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the statistic, plus any modifiers. Results of a five or a six on a die is considered a success. Most checks only require a single success, with the general exception of Combat rolls when fighting monsters. For instance, a card may require a Lore -1 roll. If the character has a Lore stat of 4, they would roll three dice and if at least one die lands on a five or six the character has passed the roll (and may gain a benefit), otherwise he or she has failed (and may suffer a consequence). Characters may also become Blessed, which allows them to succeed on a four or higher; or Cursed, which means they can only succeed on a roll of six. Throughout the game, characters collect Clue tokens; a Clue token can be spent to get a bonus die during a roll (after the original roll fails to produce enough successes). There are Skill cards that can be acquired, increasing a statistic by one as well as granting an extra bonus die when you spend a Clue token on that particular type of roll. Each turn, the players move their characters on the board and either have Encounters at a location (by drawing cards specific to that board location) or fight monsters. They may also purchase items at some locations, or take advantage of other special features. For example, characters who spend a turn at Arkham Asylum will regain a point to their sanity score, or they may spend $2 in-game to regain their maximum sanity. Either way, it takes the place of their normal Encounter card draw for that turn. Characters who encounter monsters have the option to sneak past them or fight them. Fighting a monster first involves a Sanity check, needing only a single success but losing Sanity tokens indicated on the monster if the roll fails. After that check, the character may cast spells or use weapons to affect the combat. If the monster is not immediately destroyed or removed from the board, they then roll Fight plus any bonuses from weapons, items or spells. Some monsters only require a single success, while others may require several to destroy. At the end of each turn, the first player draws a card from the Mythos deck. This causes a gate to another world to open, as well as releasing new monsters onto the board, causing existing monsters to move on the board and often adding a new effect to gameplay. If enough monsters appear on the board, they are recycled, and the terror level of Arkham increases, indicating that Arkham is slowly being completely overrun by monsters. If the terror level rises high enough, stores begin to close and potential allies flee, and the Ancient One will awaken even faster once Arkham becomes completely infested. Weather may make it more difficult to move through the streets or a rumor might require investigators to complete an action in a certain number of turns to prevent even worse effects from happening. After the Mythos card is resolved, play passes clockwise to the next player to start a new turn. Certain events add tokens to the Ancient One's card, representing how close it is to awakening. Typically, when a new gate opens a token goes onto the Ancient One's card. Gates may be closed by investigators through a die roll. Alternately, a gate may be sealed by spending Clue tokens, or with an Elder Sign item. Sealing a gate prevents another gate from opening in that location again, and using an Elder Sign removes a token from the Ancient One. If the Ancient One's card reaches a specified number, it awakens and investigators must immediately deal with the threat. Combat against an Ancient One varies, but typically involves making rolls to remove tokens from it, while the Ancient One lowers their stats each turn or takes certain tokens from them. Investigators who lose all of that token type are immediately devoured and removed from the game. If the Ancient One is defeated, the players win; otherwise, the game is over and they have lost. ===Expansions=== An expansion entitled Curse of the Dark Pharaoh was released in June, 2006, with a revised version released in 2011. This expansion added many new cards to the game, including items and encounters. The theme was that a travelling museum exhibit from Egypt has arrived in Arkham, bringing with it accursed artifacts and strange happenings. Heavy emphasis is placed on Nyarlathotep, one of Lovecraft's iconic Outer Gods. The second expansion entitled Dunwich Horror was released during Gen Con 2006. Based on Lovecraft's short story The Dunwich Horror, it includes a new board that is placed against the original Arkham Horror board. This new board features locations in the town of Dunwich. Investigators may visit Dunwich by travelling through the Train Station in Arkham or using certain vehicle items. In addition, the game includes new Encounter, Mythos and item cards as well as new mechanics, such as the stalking monster movement, and new Great Old Ones. When a character loses their last point of Sanity, they may take a Madness card which imposes restrictions on the character and restores their maximum Sanity, instead of losing half of their items and clues. A similar Injury deck is provided for investigators who reach zero Stamina. Plus, a new monster, the Dunwich Horror itself, is provided as a special monster whose powers vary from combat to combat. A third expansion, The King in Yellow, was confirmed in October 2006 and released in June 2007. Like Curse of the Dark Pharaoh, it is a card-only expansion, which this time focuses on a mysterious play that is being performed in Arkham. Based on the Robert W. Chambers story The King in Yellow, this expansion introduces the mechanic of the Herald — a special card that permanently alters the game rules. The first Herald is The King in Yellow himself, which causes the Doom track to increase every time the Terror track does unless you take a permanent penalty. Support for The Dark Pharaoh has since been added on the Fantasy Flight Games website as a Herald for the Curse of the Dark Pharaoh expansion. A third Herald has also been added on the Fantasy Flight Games website for the Dunwich Horror expansion. A fourth expansion, Kingsport Horror, was released in June 2008. It is similar to Dunwich Horror in that it is board-based rather than card-based. This expansion adds the additional locations of Kingsport, a new game element of Dimensional Rifts, and aquatic monsters that may move to any other \\"aquatic\\" location instead of following normal routes. The expansion also includes new Ancient Ones, new Investigators, new Heralds and introduces Guardians which assist the players much the way Heralds hinder them. A fifth expansion, Black Goat of the Woods, was released at Gen Con in August 2008. Another cards-only expansion, the set adds another Herald, a new membership similar to the Silver Twilight Lodge, a new element called Corruption, and difficulty cards that allow you to make the game optionally easier or harder. In addition, the expansion includes additional Mythos, Gate, Encounter, Spell, Skill, and Unique and Common item cards to be incorporated into the original game. A sixth expansion, Innsmouth Horror, was announced on the Fantasy Flight Games Website in February 2009 and released in May 2009. The third board expansion adds the town of Innsmouth as well as 16 new investigators, 8 new Ancient Ones, and two new Heralds. Also included are new personal stories cards for investigators, monsters, and encounter cards. A seventh expansion, The Lurker at the Threshold was announced in February 2010. It was released by Fantasy Flight Games in July 2010. This is a small expansion, including a new herald sheet along with over 100 location cards, new Mythos, Gate cards, spells, etc. This expansion includes 18 Gate Markers, designed to replace original ones, and introduces new challenges for investigators trying to seal them. In addition new special Relationship cards were included, which describe how the investigator to your left is related to you and grants some benefit. Also, a new mechanic of making pacts with the Lurker itself were introduced. An eighth expansion, Miskatonic Horror was announced in February 2011 and released in July 2011. The eighth expansion adds nearly 450 new cards, including new Skill, Gate, and Mythos cards. This expansion adds mostly to the other Arkham Horror expansions apart from the main game. Also, new player reference sheets as well as a new Institution variant has been added. ===Reception=== Ben Kuchera reviewed the game for Ars Technica, and noted that in a game with 700 tokens \\"brevity is not one of its strengths... A short game is still measured in hours, and learning to play the game smoothly takes some time. Even with seasoned players, simply setting everything up can take a while, and once you begin adding expansions, the amount of space you need to enjoy the game is increased.\\" He concluded that this may not be a game for new players, or players not used to complicated rules systems, saying, \\"it's a big, long, complicated game. It's only fun if you have a regular group of gaming friends who get don't mind learning something that's not immediately intuitive. But if you have the space, the time, and the friends... it's worth the investment.\\" ==2018 edition== A third edition of Arkham Horror was released by Fantasy Flight Games on November 1, 2018.https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2018/11/1/the-end-is-here/ This version incorporates design elements from Eldritch Horror and Arkham Horror: The Card Game. An expansion, Dead of Night, was released on October 8, 2019. A second expansion, Under Dark Waves, set to re-explore Innsmouth and Kingsport, was released on September 18. 2020. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Fantasy Flight's Arkham Horror webpage * * Arkham Horror Wiki Category:Adventure board games Category:Board games introduced in 1987 Category:Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game) Category:Chaosium games Category:Cooperative board games Category:Cthulhu Mythos games Category:Fantasy Flight Games games Category:Horror board games Category:Origins Award winners ","title":"Arkham Horror"},{"id":"2204556","text":"\\"Rover\\" is a song traditionally sung at the end of athletic contest victories by fans of the University of California Los Angeles. It is a parody of the song \\"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover\\". The UCLA Band arrangement opens with \\"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight\\". Following the opening, the band then plays the chorus to \\"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover\\". The band and students sing the lyrics, then the band plays the chorus again. ==History== The song \\"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover\\" was popularized in 1948 by Art Mooney. It was written in 1927 with words by Mort Dixon, and music by Harry M. Woods. \\"There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight'\\" was written in 1886 with original lyrics by Joe Hayden and music by Theodore Metz, band leader of the McIntyre and Heath Minstrels. The UCLA Band arrangement is titled \\"Stanford Game (1954)\\", implying that it was originally played during the halftime of that football game by the UCLA Band. The current song originated in the late 1960s, when a band student wrote the parody lyrics to the tune of \\"I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover\\" during a football game. The UCLA song was retitled simply \\"Rover\\". At the height of the John Wooden era (1948–1975), \\"Rover\\" was played only after lopsided basketball victories. Now, \\"Rover\\" is played after all UCLA athletic victories immediately following the alma mater. The lyric \\"scattered all over the court\\" is changed to \\"scattered all over the field\\" when at a football or soccer match. Also, after the band sings the lyric \\"and in his head there's a great big dent\\" they jump off their seats or benches simultaneously and continue singing. ==Lyrics== The lyrics to the song are as follows: ==Song notes== * The words \\"all right\\" and \\"next page\\" in parentheses above originate from the days in the 1960s and 1970s when the UCLA student spirit organization, Rally Committee, wrote the words in markers on cards borrowed from the card stunts performed at football games. In card-stunt style, only the cards with the current and next line of lyrics were shown to the crowd; the other cards were reversed, with a half-dozen Rally Committee members standing in front of the crowd each with a card and turning them at the proper time. The words \\"(All Right!)\\" (parentheses included) appeared at the bottom of the card with the line \\"that we overran tonight\\", and the words \\"(Next Page)\\" (also parentheses included) followed the lyrics \\"are scattered all over the court\\". As a joke, the students sang the words in parentheses, and they eventually became part of the tradition. * During the annual game against traditional rival USC, the lyrics are changed slightly, changing the word \\"dog\\" to \\"horse\\", as a parody of the Trojans' horse mascot, Traveler. * Following \\"And in his head, there's a great big dent\\", singers jump on the bleachers to make the \\"crashing\\" sound. * During the run of NCAA basketball championships, the UCLA Band reserved an arrangement of the \\"Hallelujah Chorus\\" to be played only after a victory in the championship game. * Other arrangements have been recorded including ** \\"My Dead Dog Rover\\" by Hank Stu Dave and Hank (Hank Landsberg and Dave Whited) from 1977, which appears on the Dr. Demento 25th Anniversary Collection ** \\"I’m Lookin’ Over My Dead Dog Rover\\" by Kevin Gershon from 1973 and played on KMET FM in Los Angeles ==See also== * \\"Mighty Bruins\\" - UCLA fight song from 1984 * \\"Hail to the Hills of Westwood\\" - UCLA alma mater * \\"Strike Up The Band\\" - UCLA official song * \\"Sons of Westwood\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * UCLA History Project: UCLA Traditions (original text taken from there) Category:UCLA Bruins Category:University of California, Los Angeles ","title":"Rover (UCLA song)"},{"id":"2204566","text":"In computing, preemption is the act of temporarily interrupting a task being carried out by a computer system, without requiring its cooperation, and with the intention of resuming the task at a later time. Such changes of the executed task are known as context switches. They are normally carried out by a privileged task or part of the system known as a preemptive scheduler, which has the power to preempt, or interrupt, and later resume, other tasks in the system. == User mode and kernel mode == In any given system design, some operations performed by the system may not be preemptible. This usually applies to kernel functions and service interrupts which, if not permitted to run to completion, would tend to produce race conditions resulting in deadlock. Barring the scheduler from preempting tasks while they are processing kernel functions simplifies the kernel design at the expense of system responsiveness. The distinction between user mode and kernel mode, which determines privilege level within the system, may also be used to distinguish whether a task is currently preemptible. Most modern systems have preemptive kernels, designed to permit tasks to be preempted even when in kernel mode. Examples of such systems are Solaris 2.0/SunOS 5.0, Windows NT, Linux kernel (2.6.x and newer), AIX and some BSD systems (NetBSD, since version 5). == Preemptive multitasking == The term preemptive multitasking is used to distinguish a multitasking operating system, which permits preemption of tasks, from a cooperative multitasking system wherein processes or tasks must be explicitly programmed to yield when they do not need system resources. In simple terms: Preemptive multitasking involves the use of an interrupt mechanism which suspends the currently executing process and invokes a scheduler to determine which process should execute next. Therefore, all processes will get some amount of CPU time at any given time. In preemptive multitasking, the operating system kernel can also initiate a context switch to satisfy the scheduling policy's priority constraint, thus preempting the active task. In general, preemption means \\"prior seizure of\\". When the high priority task at that instance seizes the currently running task, it is known as preemptive scheduling. The term \\"preemptive multitasking\\" is sometimes mistakenly used when the intended meaning is more specific, referring instead to the class of scheduling policies known as time-shared scheduling, or time- sharing. Preemptive multitasking allows the computer system to more reliably guarantee each process a regular \\"slice\\" of operating time. It also allows the system to rapidly deal with important external events like incoming data, which might require the immediate attention of one or another process. At any specific time, processes can be grouped into two categories: those that are waiting for input or output (called \\"I/O bound\\"), and those that are fully utilizing the CPU (\\"CPU bound\\"). In early systems, processes would often \\"poll\\", or \\"busy-wait\\" while waiting for requested input (such as disk, keyboard or network input). During this time, the process was not performing useful work, but still maintained complete control of the CPU. With the advent of interrupts and preemptive multitasking, these I/O bound processes could be \\"blocked\\", or put on hold, pending the arrival of the necessary data, allowing other processes to utilize the CPU. As the arrival of the requested data would generate an interrupt, blocked processes could be guaranteed a timely return to execution. Although multitasking techniques were originally developed to allow multiple users to share a single machine, it soon became apparent that multitasking was useful regardless of the number of users. Many operating systems, from mainframes down to single-user personal computers and no-user control systems (like those in robotic spacecraft), have recognized the usefulness of multitasking support for a variety of reasons. Multitasking makes it possible for a single user to run multiple applications at the same time, or to run \\"background\\" processes while retaining control of the computer. === Time slice === The period of time for which a process is allowed to run in a preemptive multitasking system is generally called the time slice or quantum. The scheduler is run once every time slice to choose the next process to run. The length of each time slice can be critical to balancing system performance vs process responsiveness - if the time slice is too short then the scheduler will consume too much processing time, but if the time slice is too long, processes will take longer to respond to input. An interrupt is scheduled to allow the operating system kernel to switch between processes when their time slices expire, effectively allowing the processor's time to be shared between a number of tasks, giving the illusion that it is dealing with these tasks in parallel (simultaneously). The operating system which controls such a design is called a multi-tasking system. === System support === Today, nearly all operating systems support preemptive multitasking, including the current versions of Windows, macOS, Linux (including Android) and iOS. Some of the earliest operating systems available to home users featuring preemptive multitasking were Sinclair QDOS (1984QL History FAQ: Firmware) and Amiga OS (1985). These both ran on Motorola 68000-family microprocessors without memory management. Amiga OS used dynamic loading of relocatable code blocks (\\"hunks\\" in Amiga jargon) to multitask preemptively all processes in the same flat address space. Early PC operating systems such as MS-DOS and PC DOS, did not support multitasking at all, however alternative operating systems such as MP/M-86 (1981) and Concurrent CP/M-86 did support preemptive multitasking. Other Unix-like systems including MINIX and Coherent provided preemptive multitasking on 1980s-era personal computers. Later DOS versions natively supporting preemptive multitasking/multithreading include Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, Novell DOS (later called Caldera OpenDOS and DR-DOS 7.02 and higher). Since Concurrent DOS 386, they could also run multiple DOS programs concurrently in virtual DOS machines. The earliest version of Windows to support a limited form of preemptive multitasking was Windows 2.1x, which used the Intel 80386's Virtual 8086 mode to run DOS applications in virtual 8086 machines, commonly known as \\"DOS boxes\\", which could be preempted. In Windows 95, 98 and Me, 32-bit applications were made preemptive by running each one in a separate address space, but 16-bit applications remained cooperative for backward compatibility.How 16-Bit and 32-Bit Programs Multitask in Windows 95 (Q117567) In Windows 3.1x (protected mode), the kernel and virtual device drivers ran preemptively, but all 16-bit applications were non-preemptive and shared the same address space. Preemptive multitasking has always been supported by Windows NT (all versions), OS/2 (native applications), Unix and Unix-like systems (such as Linux, BSD and macOS), VMS, OS/360, and many other operating systems designed for use in the academic and medium-to-large business markets. Although there were plans to upgrade the cooperative multitasking found in the classic Mac OS to a preemptive model (and a preemptive API did exist in Mac OS 9, although in a limited sense), these were abandoned in favor of Mac OS X (now called macOS) that, as a hybrid of the old Mac System style and NeXTSTEP, is an operating system based on the Mach kernel and derived in part from BSD, which had always provided Unix-like preemptive multitasking. == See also == * Computer multitasking * Cooperative multitasking == References == Category:Operating system technology Category:Concurrent computing de:Multitasking#Präemptives Multitasking ","title":"Preemption (computing)"},{"id":"2204569","text":"Messalonskee Lake is a body of water in the Belgrade Lakes region of Maine.

He is a flanker for Bristol Bears, though he is more known for his 12 years (2000–10,13) at the ACT Brumbies in Super Rugby, earning 142 caps. He made his test debut in 2000 against France in Paris and earning 111 caps for Australia, 110 before retiring from international rugby on 5 February 2010 and one final cap against the British and Irish Lions on 6 July 2013. He is the second most capped Wallaby forward behind Nathan Sharpe, and is the second most capped flanker in rugby union behind Richie McCaw. He holds the world record as the youngest player to have played 100 test matches at 29 years and 4 days. ==Early life and junior career== Smith was born in Manly, Sydney. He began playing rugby with the Manly Roos/Warringah Roos,Jon Geddes. The Daily Telegraph. 26 March 2010. Retrieved 24 January 2015 before moving on to play the majority of his junior career with the Manly Vikings, and Tupou College in Tonga, playing a year above his age group in the Sydney junior rugby competition. Once that team had reached its age limit (18 years old) and moved on to the colts competition, Smith remained in the Sydney junior rugby competition, this time lining up in his correct age group for the Seaforth- Balgowlah Raiders. He then progressed to playing in the Manly 1st grade Colts side who also won a premiership in 1999. It was during that season that Smith made his first grade debut at Nepean Rugby Park against The Penrith Emus. During his junior career he was selected for many representative teams, including Manly, Sydney, Northern Zone, NSW, and Australian Under 16s. Smith also had a successful school career, first at Balgowlah Boys High School, then at Cromer High School, where, along with Tongan international John Payne, he won the Australian Schools Championship. He played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1998. ==Senior careerBrumbies and Australia: 2000–2010=== He was signed to the ACT Brumbies by Eddie Jones in 1999. He made his Super 12 debut in just his first year of professional rugby in 2000, playing against the Sharks, and he scored a try in the Brumbies Super 12 final loss to the Canterbury Crusaders. In a remarkable year, Smith was also capped for the first time in the Wallabies end of season tour against France. Smith was a key player for the Wallabies from 2000–09. He was often voted Players' Player of the Year, awarded for fair-play by his teammates and officials. He has recently been chosen as a member of the Wallaby Team of the Decade, a remarkable feat considering his age and one of only three current players picked. In 2002, he was the first recipient of the John Eales Medal, awarded by the Australian Rugby Union and the Rugby Union Players' Association to their Player of the Year. He won Australian Super 14 Player of the Year four years in a row between 2006 and 2009. In 2007 the breakdown specialist capped off another remarkable season claiming awards including: the Brett Robinson Award as the Brumbies' Players' Player for the fifth consecutive year; Super 14 Player of the Year;Flanker George Smith wins Super 14 Australian player of the series award – International Herald Tribune and the Rugby Union Players' Association 'Rugby Medal for Excellence'. These recognitions underlined his position as one of rugby's most respected players, reinforced further when he became the Wallabies 75th captain, against Canada at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. 2008 was a big year for Smith. He captained the Brumbies and the Wallabies and became the first player to win the John Eales Medal, twice. In addition, Smith won the \\"Super 14 Player of the Year Award\\", for the third consecutive year and the Brett Robinson Award as the Brumbies' Players' Player of the year for the sixth consecutive year. He also reached a personal milestone during the season, when he made his 100th Super Rugby appearance against the Cheetahs in round six. In a memorable double for the Smith family, George's younger brother, Brumbies teammate Tyrone, was named rookie of the year. In the international arena, the older Smith also became both the most capped flanker and the most capped forward – the latter being previously held by John Eales. On 5 February 2010, Smith announced his retirement from international rugby. 2010 was expected to be his last in Super Rugby. Smith celebrated with the achievement of his 9th Brumbies Players' Player of the Year, with eight of those awards being consecutive. ===Toulon, Stade Français and Suntory: 2011–2013=== In June 2010, Smith signed a one-year contract with French Top 14 club Toulon. His RC Toulonnais teammates included former Highlander and All Black prop Carl Hayman, and former Brumbies' scrum-half Matt Henjak. Later in 2010 he was selected in the French Barbarians to play at blindside flanker (number 6) against Tonga. Smith played for the Australia XV team alongside fellow Tongan, Lisiate Tafa, in the Southern Hemisphere Charity Fundraiser in March 2011 against the Pacific Barbarians. In the following month Smith become the highest paid Australian rugby player by signing with Japanese club, Suntory Sungoliath, on a $3.3 million three-year deal. He joined Stade Français in 2012 on a short-term contract for the end of their Top 14 and European Challenge Cup seasons. ===Brumbies and Lions Series: 2013=== In early 2013 the Brumbies announced tha Smith would return to Australia on a short term contract for the 2013 Super Rugby season. This followed Ita Vaea's season-ending injury. Smith gained the approval of his Japanese club Sungoliath for his 12-week stint back in Australia. Smith was recalled to the Australian squad in June that year for the series against the British and Irish Lions, after recovering from a knee injury. After being overlooked for the second test, Smith was named as the starting open side flanker for the third and deciding test in Sydney. It was his first test since retiring from international rugby in February 2010 and broke Colin Meads' record of 4382 days between his first test against the Lions, and his last. ===Lyon and Wasps: 2014–2016=== After leaving French club Lyon on their relegation to the Pro D2, Smith made a move to England to sign for Wasps in the Aviva Premiership from the 2015–16 season. During his season with Wasps, Smith won a number of awards; including Wasps' Players' Player of the Year, Wasps' Player of the Year, Aviva Premiership Players' Player of the Year and Green Flag Forward of the Season. During his spell in England, Smith was also involved in the England coaching setup during the 2016 Six Nations Championship ===Queensland Reds and Suntory: 2016–2018=== In mid 2016 it was confirmed that Smith would leave Wasps in England to return to Japanese club Suntory Sungoliath, and that he would also play for the Queensland Reds in the 2017 and 2018 Super Rugby seasons. On 13 July 2018, Smith played his final home game for Queensland Reds, having initially been ruled out with a knee injury. This was his final professional game in Australia. ===Bristol: 2018–2019=== Smith joined the Bristol Bears in England for their 2018–19 Premiership Rugby season. He retired from professional rugby at the end of that season. ==Personal life== Smith, who is of Tongan background, is the older brother of fellow Brumbies player and Tongan rugby league international Tyrone Smith. He was easily recognised on the field by his dreadlocked hair style until late 2006 – when he decided to sell his dreadlocks for charity. They were given to a charity for younger people with cancer. Smith was the face of the Australian version of Electronic Arts' video game Rugby 2005. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 2012. ==See also== *List of 2012–13 Super Rugby transfers *Wallaby Team of the Decade *Super Rugby ==ReferencesExternal links== * Stats on It's rugby * Wallabies Profile * ESPNscrum Profile ==Bibliography== * Category:1980 births Category:Australian rugby union players Category:Australian people of Tongan descent Category:Australia international rugby union players Category:Australian rugby union captains Category:Rugby union flankers Category:Brumbies players Category:Stade Français rugby players Category:Suntory Sungoliath players Category:Lyon OU players Category:World Rugby Awards winners Category:Members of the Order of Australia Category:RC Toulonnais players Category:Australian expatriate rugby union players Category:Expatriate rugby union players in France Category:Expatriate rugby union players in Japan Category:Australian expatriate sportspeople in Japan Category:Australian expatriate sportspeople in France Category:Rugby union players from Sydney Category:Living people Category:People from Manly, New South Wales ","title":"George Smith (rugby union)"},{"id":"2204594","text":"Ampere is a screamo band based in Amherst, Massachusetts known for their short (10–15 minutes) but extremely loud and intense live shows. The band has put the importance of DIY punk ethics at the forefront of their lyrics and are known for the particular attention they bring to their vegan principles. ==History== The members of the bands have been involved in the DIY punk scene for a number of years with the most notable being guitarist Will Killingsworth, who played guitar in Orchid, Laceration and Bucket Full of Teeth and who continues to run his Clean Plate record label and Dead Air recording studio where the band records all of their music. He was also in the hardcore \\"super group\\" Failures, as well as Vaccine and Won't Belong. Drummer Andy Skelly played drums in both The Last 40 Seconds and Wolves, Stephen's previous bands were Montcalm, The Last 40 Seconds, and 175 Grams. He concurrently played guitar in self-destructive supergroup Aerosols. He also briefly ran Distort, an independent record store in Northampton, MA (May '06 - December '06). Meghan played bass in Unicoroner, and sang in Stop The Clock and Relics on their first 7-inch and split 7-inch with Furnace. Much like Orchid, Ampere (especially earlier albums such as \\"All our Tomorrows End Today\\") often borrow some of their lyrics from philosophers and revolutionaries such as Guy Debord. They have preserved some of the \\"intellectual\\" punk seen in bands like Orchid, Sinaloa, Native Nod, Current, and others. In all of their endeavors, Ampere has persisted in their commitment to intellect, art, and sincerity. The band actively tour in the US and completed a tour of Europe with Sinaloa in March 2006. A split record on Ebullition Records between the two bands was released in time for the tour, along with a 7-inch of their early recordings and a four-way split 11-inch with Death to Tyrants, Wasteland and Daniel Striped Tiger which was recorded live at Dead Air. Since then, a split 12-inch composed completely of cover songs was released with Das Oath. 2007 was a productive year for the band, encompassing a brief Japanese tour as well as three new split records; a 6-inch with Ringers on No Idea Records, which, after the first press was re- released as a 7-inch (both versions of the record came with limited runs of T-shirts featuring the album art), a 9-inch with Funeral Diner put out jointly by Clean Plate and The Electric Human Project (this release included intricate etchings between the grooves), and a 7-inch picture disk with France's Daitro on Clean Plate/purepainsugar. In 2008, an Australian-tour-only split 7-inch with Off Minor was released. Both bands contributed a previously released but compilation-exclusive song from an Animal Rights benefit CD on Exotic Fever. It is Ampere's most limited release to date (aside from the cassette format of the demo tape) at a scant 300 copies. Each band took 150 for their respective jaunts down under and made different packaging. In June 2011 the band's second LP titled \\"Like Shadows\\" was released on No Idea Records. In August 2015, a split 8\\" with Italian band Raein was released on No Idea Records. Pierce and Skelly continue to play together in indie/shoegaze band Kindling, who have a 12\\" forthcoming in Fall 2015 on No Idea Records. Killingsworth and Minior also play together in punk band Longings, with an LP coming out on Framework / Echo Canyon Records in September 2015.

Valerius Corvus, for the third time, and A. Cornelius Cossus were consuls. When converted to the western calendar using the traditional Varronian chronology, which Livy did not use, this becomes 343 BC. However modern historians have shown that the Varronian chronology dates the First Samnite War four years too early due to inclusion of unhistorical \\"dictator years\\". Despite this known inaccuracy, the Varronian chronology remains in use by convention also in academic literature. Forsythe(2005), pp. 369–370 was the first battle of the First Samnite War and also the first battle fought between the Roman Republic and the Samnites. The battle is described by the Roman historian Livy (59 BC – AD 17) as part of Book Seven of his history of Rome, Ab Urbe Condita where he narrates how the Roman consul Marcus Valerius Corvus won a hard-fought battle against the Samnites at Mount Gaurus, near Cumae, in Campania. Modern historians however believe that most, if not all, of the detail in Livy's description has been invented by him or his sources. ==Background== According to Livy the First Samnite War started because the Samnites attacked the Sidicini, a tribe living north of Campania. The Campani, led by the city-state of Capua, sent an army to help the Sidicini, but were beaten in battle by the Samnites. The Samnites then invaded Campania and won a second battle on the plain near Capua. Facing defeat, the Campani appealed to Rome for aid. The Romans, despite having a treaty with the Samnites, agreed to help and declared war against the Samnites.Livy, vii.29.3–32.1–2. On the historicity of these events see Salmon(1967), pp. 197–201; Oakley(1998), pp. 286–289; Forsythe(2005). pp. 285–288 The two Roman consuls for 343, Marcus Valerius Corvus and Aulus Cornelius Cossus, marched each their armies against the Samnites. Valerius led his into Campania and Cornelius his into Samnium.Livy, vii.32.2 ==The battle== Valerius camped his army at Mount Gaurus. The Samnites had moved into Campania in force, believing this would be the main theatre of war, and were eager to fight. After testing his enemy's strength for a few days with skirmishers, Valerius prepared the Roman army for battle.Livy, vii.32.2–17 The Romans marched out of camp and a battle ensued. The battle went on for some time, with the two sides evenly matched neither could gain the upper hand. Valerius therefore ordered a cavalry charge in an attempt to break the Samnite lines. The charge failed and the Roman cavalry had to pull back. With the Roman cavalry retreated, a dismounted Valerius decided to lead an infantry assault in person, but once again the Samnite lines did not break despite taking dreadful losses. The battle had now lasted a long time and daylight was fading. The Romans, weary but fuelled by rage and disappointment, made one last mad attack. At last the Samnites fled, and not many would have survived if nightfall had not put an end to the pursuit.Livy, vii.33.4–15 When asked why in the end they had fled, the Samnites answered it was \\"the eyes of the Romans, which seemed to them to blaze, along with their furious expression and frenzied glare\\".Livy, vii.33.16; quoted translation from During the night the Samnites departed and left the Romans to take possession of their camp on the next day. All the Campani came out to congratulate the Romans with their victory.Livy, vii.33.17–18 ==Aftermath== Livy records two more Roman victories against the Samnites in 343, a victory by the other consul, Cornelius Cossus, at the Battle of Saticula, and a second victory by Valerius Corvus at the Battle of Suessula. At the end of the campaign season both consuls were rewarded at Rome with a triumph. The Carthaginians, with whom the Romans had concluded a treaty of friendship in 348, congratulated Rome for her victories by sending a golden crown weighing twenty-five pounds for the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.Livy, vii.34–38 According to the Fasti Triumphales, Valerius and Cornelius celebrated their triumphs over the Samnites on 21 September and 22 September respectively. For the two next years little fighting is recorded and the First Samnite War ended in 341 with Rome and the Samnites renewing their treaty and the Samnites accepting the Roman alliance with the Campani. ==Modern views== Modern historians believe little, if any, of the detail provided by Livy for this battle derive from authentic records. Livy's battle-scenes for this time period are mostly free reconstructions by him and his sources, and as the historic first battle between Romans and Samnites the Battle of Mount Gaurus would be particularly susceptible to such inventions.Oakley(1998), p. 310 Samnite losses have clearly been exaggerated.Salmon(1967), p. 198 The role of Valerius Corvus in the events of the First Samnite War might have been exaggerated as well, especially, if as Salmon(1967) held, Valerius Antias was Livy's chief source for this part of his work, but other historians than Antias were capable of exaggerating the Valerii as well.Salmon(1967), p. 197; Oakley(1998), pp. 309–310 Salmon(1967) suspected Valerius' victories in 343 could be doublets of Roman operations against Hannibal in the same area in 215, he also doubted the location of the battle at Mount Gaurus, close to Cumae, but far from Capua.Salmon(1967), p. 198 Since the testimony of the Fasti Triumphales require some degree of Roman success in 343 and arguing that in this time period the Romans were more likely to defeat the Samnites on level than mountainous ground, Salmon(1967) therefore proposed that there was only one battle in 343 which was fought on the outskirts of Capua near the shrine of Juno Gaura, which Livy or his source has then confused with Mount Gaurus. This would explain Livy's description of the Capuans coming out to congratulate the Romans. The battle might not have been such a total rout of the Samnites as Livy describes. Fighting interrupted by nightfall was often used by Roman historians to hide Roman failures.Salmon(1967), p. 201 This reconstruction is rejected by Oakley(1998) who does not believe there are any doublets in Livy's account for 343. The Samnites would have gained significant ground in Campania by the time the Romans arrived and Valerius' two victories could be the outcome of twin Samnite attacks on Capua and Cumae.Oakley(1998), pp. 310–311 ==See also== *List of Roman battles ==Note on dateReferencesExternal links== *Livy, History of Rome, English Translation by.

He then worked in Paris as a sound engineer at studio +XXX (\\"plus thirty\\") where he met Philippe Zdar of Cassius, with whom he worked as Motorbass for the album Pansoul, a preview of what would be his first solo album, Super Discount, released in 1996, with Air, Alex Gopher and other French artists on Solid. Étienne de Crécy has been involved in various music projects where he worked as a producer. ==Releases== Super Discount was Étienne de Crécy's first release, including the well known singles \\"Tout doit disparaître\\" (Everything must go) and \\"Prix Choc\\" (Shock Price). Super Discount is considered by many as the first album of what is called the French touch. Super Discount received very favourable reviews and sold over 200,000 copies. Four years after Super Discount, Étienne de Crécy released Tempovision. Unlike Super Discount, which was perfectly adapted for the radio, Tempovision is a mature album, a deep reflection on the electronic music of this time. In Étienne de Crécy's opinion it was a blues album, differing from some of his earlier and more recent work. The Tempovision track \\"Am I Wrong\\" used a sample of Millie Jackson's voice singing \\"Am I wrong to hunger...\\", from the song \\"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\\". \\"Am I Wrong\\" peaked at No. 44 in the UK Singles Chart in January 2001. The three 3D animated videos to accompany singles from the Tempovision album were directed by Étienne's brother, Geoffroy de Crécy. Eight years after the first Super Discount album, came Super Discount 2 with the original team, and the addition of Cassius. For this album, he used only old analog instruments, for example a TB303, and produced twelve electro-house-pop-new wave songs designed for clubs, in the continuity of the first Super Discount. Pursuing the 'discount' concept of the first album, all the tracks are named after peer-to- peer clients: \\"Overnet\\", \\"Napster\\", and so on. Étienne de Crécy, talking about the concept for the third album, said: “you have to be autistic in working in the music industry not to realize that something happens through the MP3 exchanges. It’s not discount anymore! It’s free!” and added “what the music industry doesn’t understand, is that young people will not build their own music culture if they don’t have free access to the music.” Étienne de Crécy's more recent tracks have focused more on an electronic sound. They have also begun to be released on the Pixadelic label. ==Selected discography== The discography of Étienne de Crécy consists of four studio albums, one live album, three compilation albums, eighteen extended plays and fifteen singles. === Studio albums === * Super Discount (1996, Different) * Tempovision (2000, Solid) FR No. 57 * Super Discount 2 (2004, Solid) FR No. 72, BE (FL) No. 70 * Super Discount 3 (2015, Pixadelic/A+LSO/Sony Music) FR No. 40, BE (FL) No. 56, BE (WA) No. 103, SWI No. 99 * B.E.D (2018, PIAS, collaboration with Baxter Dury and Delilah Holliday) ===Live albums=== * Live on Neptune (2007, Pixadelic) (digital only) ===Compilation albums=== * Tempovision Remixes (2002, Solid) * Beats'n'Cubes Vol.1 (2011, Dim Mak) * My Contribution to the Global Warming (2012, Pixadelic) ===Extended plays and singles=== { !rowspan=2 Year !rowspan=2 Title !colspan=4 Chart positions !rowspan=2 Album -style=\\"font-size:smaller;\\" !width=30 FR !width=30 BE !width=30 NL !width=30 UK -

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 14, 1995.. In the episode, the children of Springfield try to retrieve their beloved lemon tree after it is stolen by the children of Shelbyville. The episode was written by Brent Forrester and directed by Jim Reardon. For this episode, the animators designed a non-polluted version of Springfield. It features cultural references to the 1984 song \\"When Doves Cry\\", the 1981 film Mad Max 2, and the 1968 song \\"What a Wonderful World\\". The episode's title is a play on the name Helen of Troy from Greek mythology. The episode acquired a Nielsen rating of 8.1. The episode has garnered universal acclaim and is regarded as a classic episode of the show. ==Plot== Marge lectures Bart on the importance of town pride after he writes his name in wet cement. Soon he realizes the joys of living in Springfield and is upset by anti-Springfield taunts coming from neighboring Shelbyville. Grampa explains this rivalry can be traced to the establishment of the two towns: Jebediah Springfield wanted a town which promoted chastity and abstinence, but Shelbyville Manhattan, founder of Shelbyville, was a proponent of cousin marriage. The next day, Springfield's lemon tree is stolen by a gang of boys from Shelbyville. Bart leads Milhouse, Nelson, Martin, Todd and Database to Shelbyville to find the tree and return it to Springfield. Bart's posse locates the tree in an impound lot where the leader of the gang that stole the tree lives. Using Ned Flanders' RV, Homer leads the boys' fathers to their sons in Shelbyville. The fathers and sons demand their tree be returned, but the owner of the impound lot taunts them and refuses to surrender it. Using a Trojan Horse strategy, Bart parks the RV outside a hospital, where it is impounded to the lot. When night falls, the Springfield men and boys emerge from the RV and tie the lemon tree to its top. The lot owner catches them but they manage to escape and return the tree to Springfield. In the aftermath, the town elders of Springfield and Shelbyville provide their own endings to the tale. In Springfield, Grandpa lauds the triumphant return of the tree by the \\"heroes of Springfield\\"; Bart and Milhouse celebrate with a glass of lemonade made from a few drops of lemon juice (and a large amount of sugar). In Shelbyville, an old man having made up a story about the tree being haunted to cover the embarrassment of losing to their rivals of Springfield. The Shelbyville kids drink turnip juice instead, much to their disgust. ==Production== The voice of Shelby's father is based on Walter Matthau. Brent Forrester wrote \\"Lemon of Troy\\", his second episode of The Simpsons. Jim Reardon directed it. Early on in the production stage, the writers decided that the leader of the Shelbyville children, Shelby, and his father should be modeled after Bart and Homer. Shelby's voice was provided by Tress MacNeille, and Shelby's father was voiced by Hank Azaria, who based his performance on Walter Matthau as Dan Castellaneta originally based his performance of Homer on Matthau. The writers wanted to have the Springfield children find an area of Springfield that was not decimated, and the animators designed a version of Springfield that was very idyllic. They drew several scenes of the children running through non-polluted streams and woodlands. The animators gave Shelbyville's nature a more dark feeling in comparison to Springfield. ==Cultural references== In the episode, Milhouse recites a slightly paraphrased line from Prince's 1984 song \\"When Doves Cry\\". In a scene referencing \\"The Lady, or the Tiger?\\" Bart identifies the number seven in Roman numerals by referring to a nonexistent sequel of the Rocky film series, Rocky VII: Adrian's Revenge. The scene with Bart and his team sitting on a hill above the enemy camp and looking down at the captured tree being circled by children on bicycles bears a resemblance to an early scene in Mad Max 2. The method of recovery of the lemon tree is a reference to the legend of the Trojan Horse. The overall plot structure of Springfield residents attacking their neighboring rivals after they steal their prize possession is a reference to the legend of the Trojan War, in which the incentive for the Greeks declaring war on their Trojan neighbors is the abduction of their most famous and beautiful female citizen, Helen. The title of the episode is a play on her name. The method of recovery of the tree is an echo of the Trojan Horse. Homer complains that \\"Nobody cared when Bogart defaced that sidewalk in Hollywood\\", referring to when Humphrey Bogart was honoured in a ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theater to record his hand and footprints in cement in 1946. ==Reception== In its original broadcast, \\"Lemon of Troy\\" finished 55th in the ratings for the week of May 11 to May 17, 1995, with a Nielsen rating of 8.1. Retrieved on September 22, 2008. The episode was the sixth highest rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics. Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, called the episode a \\"classic\\" and said it is one of his favorites from the show. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said there was \\"some nice ideas in this episode—Bart and his chums all have near-doubles in Shelbyville—but this is a strangely pedestrian outing, and seems hidden away—wisely—at this point in the season.\\" In a DVD review of the sixth season, DVD Verdict's Ryan Keefer said the episode \\"easily [is] one of the best of the season\\" and that it has \\"gotten more enjoyable since it first aired\\". He added that the episode is \\"full of everything that makes the show successful\\" and gave it an A rating. Entertainment.ie named it among the 10 greatest Simpsons episodes of all time. Nashville Scene named it the \\"perfect episode.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== *\\"Lemon of Troy\\" at The Simpsons.com * *\\"Lemon of Troy\\" at TV.com *\\"Lemon of Troy\\" at the Internet Movie Database Category:The Simpsons (season 6) episodes Category:1995 American television episodes Category:Lemons it:Episodi de I Simpson (sesta stagione)#Limone di Troia ","title":"Lemon of Troy"},{"id":"2204647","text":"Cyrus Kar (born March 18, 1961 in Tehran, Iran) is an Iranian-born American film director, part-time professor at the University of Phoenix, and now- vindicated alleged terrorist who was captured by United States forces in Iraq on May 17, 2005, while filming a documentary on the life of Cyrus The Great.From Filmmaker in Los Angeles to Iraq Detainee, The New York Times, July 6, 2005 On July 10, 2005, he was released from custody after his family sued, accusing the U.S. government of violating his civil rights and detaining him after his clearance by the FBI.

These robots were only experimental, but later evolved into the Honda P series, with Honda eventually amassing the knowledge and experience necessary to create Honda's advanced humanoid robot: ASIMO. The fact that Honda had been developing the robots was kept secret from the public until the announcement of the Honda P2 in 1996. E0, developed in 1986, was the first robot. It walked in a straight line on two feet, in a manner resembling human locomotion, taking around 5 seconds to complete a single step. Quickly engineers realised that in order to walk up slopes, the robot would need to travel faster. The model has 6 degrees of freedom: one in each groin, one in each knee and one in each ankle. ==Models== *E0 developed in 1986 *E1, developed in 1987, was larger than the first and walked at 0.25 km/h.

It is a hardy breed of horse noted for endurance, agility, and good temperament. Its ancestry dates to the arrival of the first horses in Australia, brought from Europe, Africa, and Asia. It is used today in a wide variety of disciplines, and is still valued as a working horse by stockmen and stockwomen throughout Australia. ==History== The roots of the Australian Stock Horse date back to the earliest importation of nine horses to Australia, with the arrival of the First Fleet in Botany Bay in January, 1788.Keith R. Binney, Horsemen of the First Frontier (1788-1900) and the Serpents Legacy, Volcanic Productions, Sydney, 2005, Some of the original horse breeds in these early imports included the Thoroughbred, Cape of Good Hope Horse (largely descended from the Barb and Spanish horse), Arabian, Timor Pony, and Welsh Mountain pony.Gower, Jeanette. \\"Australian Stock Horse History\\" Horses in Australia were bred for their stamina and strength, with weaker animals culled and only the strongest allowed to breed. In the 1830s, additional Thoroughbreds were imported into Australia to improve the local strains, and the mid-20th century had infusions from the American Quarter Horse. The Australian Stock Horse and the Waler horse come from similar roots, though today they are separate breeds. The \\"station horse\\" that was an ancestor of both breeds was used by the Australian Army in the First World War and was renowned for its toughness and endurance. However, the modern Australian Stock Horse differs from the Waler Horse in that it is not as big. The horses shipped abroad to fight in war and kept at home to be bred on as Walers were the larger animals, as they were required to carry a rider with the considerable extra weight of weapons and a full pack. Some of the heaviest animals were also required pull water carts and carriages. However, the characteristics of toughness and endurance remain with the Australian Stock Horse of today. Formal recognition of Australian Stock Horses as a distinct breed began in June 1971, when over 100 campdrafters and horse breeders met in Tamworth, New South Wales, to form the Australian Stock Horse Society. Many of these people bred stock horses using bloodlines tracing back to native stock, along with some Arabians, Thoroughbreds, and a few ponies of outstanding merit. Most of the early ASH registrations were of horses bred with bloodlines that excelled at both campdrafting and cattle work in the rugged Great Dividing Range. Initially, horses were inspected for registration by three classifiers, who assessed them for conformation, breeding, and athletic ability. The best were accepted for inclusion in the Stud Book, some were approved for the registry appendix, and those not meeting the criteria for registration were rejected. Fourteen specific foundation sires are responsible for most of the bloodlines accepted into the Society Australia-wide, and most well-bred Australian Stock Horses trace to one of these foundation sires. These included horses bred from colonial stock: Saladin, Cecil and his son Radium, Medlow, and Bobbie Bruce. The others were Thoroughbreds; Rivoli, Commandant, Panzer, Midstream, Young Valais, Gibbergunyah, Bushfire, Silvius, and Deo Juvante also exerted considerable influence. Since then Rivoli Ray, Blue Moon Mystic, Eliotts Creek Cadet, Warrenbri Romeo, and some American Quarter Horses have also had a large influence on the breed. The use of Quarter Horse bloodlines is somewhat controversial, with some breeders preferring to stay with older lines. Those who wish to bring in outside blood are required to pay very high fees to the society, thus providing an incentive for breeders to only bring in worthwhile horses. ==Characteristics== An Australian Stock Horse The Australian Stock Horse is bred for intelligence, courage, toughness, and stamina. The horse will be sound, agile and quick moving with a sure-footed walk. It will have a calm, responsive temperament. All colours are acceptable. Height ranges from . The ideal Australian Stock Horse is well proportioned in all respects according to its size. Desired traits include a finely cut, expressive head with large eyes and a broad forehead. The neck is long and arched, with the head well set on. The withers should be well defined. Overall conformation is well-muscled, but not bulky, with correct conformation that includes a deep chest, well-sprung ribs, a strong and broad back, and powerful hindquarters. The hooves are hard and well-conformed. ==Breed today== An Australian Stock Horse competing in eventing Around 190,000 Australian Stock Horses are registered or foals recorded with the Australian Stock Horse Society. The Stock Horse is used in many competitive disciplines, including polo, polocrosse, dressage, campdrafting, show jumping, eventing, and endurance riding. It is also used for stockman challenges, Pony Club activities, general hacking, and stock work on cattle stations. While horses are now often being replaced in the flatter Outback and Top End by motorcycles and helicopters, they are still necessary today for mustering (roundups) in rugged mountain terrain. ==Public performances== A tribute to the Australian Stock Horse was held during the 2000 Sydney Olympics Opening Ceremony when an Australian Stock Horse reared and then another 120 Stock Horses were ridden into the stadium and performed intricate manoeuvres to the music of the specially written Olympics version of the main theme of the film The Man from Snowy River by Australian composer Bruce Rowland. The Australian Stock Horse Crown Law has represented Australia in World Championship and Olympic dressage competition. , the Australian Outback Spectacular used 42 Australian Stock Horses in its show on the Gold Coast, Queensland, 31 of which were used in a show on a rotational basis.Horsewyse magazine, March 2008, p.8 ==See also== * Campdrafting * The Man from Snowy River * Stock horse * Stockman (Australia) ==References== *Australian Stock Horse Society: Horses of Significance (PDF) *Gower, Peter.

He was a member of the Republican Party and served as U.S. Representative from Delaware and two terms as U.S. Senator from Delaware. He was known by his middle name. ==Early life and family== Ball was born in Mill Creek Hundred, New Castle County, Delaware, the son of John Ball and Sarah (Baldwin) Ball. He attended the Rugby Academy at Wilmington, Delaware, and graduated from the Delaware College at Newark, Delaware in 1882. He received his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia in 1885 and began the practice of medicine at Brandywine Springs, near Wilmington in 1887. He married Katherine Springer Justis on November 14, 1893. ==The Addicks Era== At the turn of the twentieth century, Delaware was going through a political transformation. Most obvious to the public was the bitter division in the Republican Party caused, in part, by the ambitions of J. Edward Addicks for a seat in the U.S. Senate. A gas company industrialist, he spent vast amounts of his own fortune to build a Republican Party, with that purpose in mind. Largely successful in heavily Democratic Kent County and Sussex County, he financed the organization of a faction that came to be known as \\"Union Republicans\\". Meanwhile, he was making bitter enemies of the New Castle County \\"Regular Republicans\\", many of whom considered him nothing more than a carpetbagger from Philadelphia. Ball was a \\"Regular Republican\\", and an outspoken opponent of Addicks. As such he was elected State Treasurer of Delaware from 1899 to 1901. He was then elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1900. and served with the Republican majority in the 57th Congress from March 4, 1901, until March 3, 1903, during the administrations of U.S. Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. In 1899 one of the U.S. Senate seats for Delaware became vacant and the Union Republicans in the Delaware General Assembly attempted to electing Addicks. Although they did not have enough votes to do so, the Union Republicans were able to block the election of any other candidate. Because of this deadlock, the seat remained vacant for four years. When the other Senate seat came open in 1901, it too was left vacant due to the deadlock. Finally, in 1903, the matter became national news and too much of an embarrassment. Addicks relented and allowed Ball to be elected to the remaining two years left on the first seat and Addicks' lieutenant, J. Frank Allee was elected to the second seat. ==United States Senator== Ball was elected to the U.S. Senate on March 2, 1903, and served the remaining two years of the term with the Republican majority in the 58th Congress. In 1905, when Ball's term ended, the General Assembly again deadlocked and took another two years to fill the seat. The repeated inability of the Delaware General Assembly to fulfill this constitutional duty contributed strong evidence throughout the nation of the need for the Seventeenth Amendment providing for the popular election of U.S. Senators. In 1918, Ball was elected to the U.S. Senate in the second popular election of a U.S. Senator in Delaware, defeating incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Willard Saulsbury, Jr.. During this term, Ball served with the Republican majority in the 66th, 67th and 68th U.S. Congress. In the 66th Congress, he was chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills and in the 67th and 68th Congress, he was a member of the Committee on the District of Columbia. He was also appointed as a member of the rent commission of Washington. Ball's actions with the rent commission angered some people. In August 1921, a shot was fired at Ball as he drove in an automobile, although he was not injured. The senator had received a threatening letter the day of the assault. In June 1919 he cast his vote in favor of the Nineteenth Amendment providing for Women's suffrage. Ball was never considered an especially effective U.S. Senator in terms of gaining patronage for Delaware. He became a rival of T. Coleman du Pont, the former President of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and the effective leader of the Republican Party in Delaware. Du Pont had hoped to be the Republican candidate for U.S. President in 1920, but his efforts began to collapse when Ball deserted him after the first ballot at the 1920 Republican National Convention. Then, in 1922, Ball failed to support du Pont as he sought a full term in the U.S. Senate himself. By 1924 du Pont thought he had a score to settle and defeated Ball for their party’s nomination for a full term in 1924. ==Death and legacy== Ball died at Faulkland, near Wilmington, and is buried in the St. James Episcopal Church Cemetery near Stanton, Delaware.Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. The State Treasurer takes office the third Tuesday of January and had a two-year term. U.S. Representatives took office March 4 and also have a two-year term. Before 1913 the General Assembly chose the U.S. Senators, who also took office March 4, but for a six-year term. In this first case, he was completing the existing term, the vacancy caused by the failure of the General Assembly to make a selection for four years. After 1913 the U.S. Senators were popularly elected. {class= style=\\"width: 94%\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" align=\\"center\\" -bgcolor=#cccccc !colspan=7 style=\\"background: #ccccff;\\" Public Offices - !

Joseph Seraphim FortesGovernment of Canada 1901 Census records his name as \\"Joseph Fortis\\" (9 February 1863 - 4 February 1922) was a British-Canadian lifeguard. He was a prominent figure in the early history of Vancouver, and the city's first official lifeguard. ==Early life== Joe Fortes was born in 1863 in Port of Spain, Trinidad according to an autobiographical article published in a Vancouver newspaper. According to one source, his father was a Barbadian \\"of full African blood\\" and his mother was \\"entirely or largely\\" Spanish or Portuguese. Other sources state that Fortes was born in Barbados. After leaving his homeland in his mid- teens, he worked in Britain for several years. In 1884 he sailed around Cape Horn from Liverpool on the Robert Kerr, arriving in Burrard Inlet, a coastal fjord in southwestern British Columbia, in September 1885. His name occurs repeatedly in the ship's log as Seraphim Fortes. ==Arrival in Vancouver== Making his home at English Bay, he lived in a tent on the beach during the milder months of the year. After the start of the 20th century, he moved into a cottage at the foot of Bidwell Street on the shore-side of Beach Avenue. His little house was later moved to the other side of the street, just east of Alexandra Park. ==Lifeguarding in English Bay== Joe Fortes devoted all of his free time to teaching children to swim and to patrolling the beach. The self- appointed unpaid guard continued to support himself by working odd jobs until, in 1900, the City appointed him its first official lifeguard. His contemporaries referred to him respectfully and lovingly as \\"Old Black Joe\\" or \\"English Bay Joe\\". The stocky, dark-skinned man was a friend and teacher to the children, a guard for the bathers and a hero to people in distress. He has been officially credited with saving 29 lives, yet it is believed that the real number is considerably higher. In 1910, the City honoured Joe Fortes for his many years of service to the public by presenting him with a gold watch, a cheque ,and an illuminated address. ==Legacy== West End's Alexandra Park by sculptor Charles Marega. Fortes died on February 4, 1922, at Vancouver General Hospital from a paralytic stroke, about three weeks after being admitted for pneumonia. A record-breaking funeral procession was held for him. Mourners crowded into Holy Rosary Cathedral to bid farewell to a brave, kind and modest friend. Fortes was buried in Mountain View Cemetery. A flat stone marks his grave, simply inscribed: \\"JOE\\". On June 24, 1927, the citizens of Vancouver dedicated a monument to Joe Fortes. The fountain in Alexandra Park by sculptor Charles Marega bears the inscription: LITTLE CHILDREN LOVED HIM. On May 20, 1976, the Joe Fortes Branch of the Vancouver Public Library was dedicated to his name and in 1985, one hundred years after he arrived in Canada, the Joe Fortes Seafood & Chop House restaurant opened.

An American F-16 fighter jet piloted by Air National Guard Major Harry Schmidt dropped a laser-guided bomb on the Canadians, who were conducting a night firing exercise at Tarnak Farms. The deaths were the first of Canada's war in Afghanistan, and the first in a combat zone since the Korean War.\\"Fallen four remain in hearts and minds\\" By Angelique Rodrigues, Edmonton Sun. 16 April 2012 ==Incident== F-16 pilots Major William Umbach and his wingman Major Harry Schmidt were returning to their base after a 10-hour night patrol. While flying at , they reported surface-to-air fire. The fire was actually from a Canadian Forces anti-tank and machine-gun exercise, which was taking place on a former Taliban firing range. Schmidt descended a few thousand feet to take a closer look, and asked for permission to \\"lay down some 20 mike-mike\\", or spray the area with 20-millimeter cannon fire, but was told to stand by. Umbach cautioned his wing man to wait, as well. \\"Let's just make sure that it's, that it's not friendlies, is all\\", he said. At 9:25, the pilots' AWACS controller ordered them to \\"hold fire\\" and asked Schmidt for more information on the surface-to- air fire. However, a minute later, after seeing another firing plume from an antitank weapon, Schmidt reported seeing \\"some men on a road, and it looks like a piece of artillery firing at us.\\" \\"I am rolling in in self-defense\\", he said. After Umbach reminded him to unlock his weapons, Schmidt called \\"bombs away\\". Twenty-two seconds later, he reported a direct hit. Ten seconds later, the controller ordered the pilots to disengage, saying the forces on the ground were \\"friendlies Kandahar\\".http://goflightmedicine.com/tarnak-farm/ Schmidt's testimony at his Article 32 hearing was that he believed his flight leader, Umbach, was under attack. The radio logs show that Schmidt requested permission from flight control to fire his 20 mm cannons at what he said to be an anti-aircraft or Multiple Launch Rocket System below. ==Casualties== Claire Leger, mother of Canadian Sergeant Marc Leger, speaks to media about the Tarnak Farms incident. The soldiers who were killed were: *Sergeant Marc D. Léger, Age: 29, from Lancaster, Ontario. *Corporal Ainsworth Dyer, Age: 24, Montreal, Quebec. *Private Richard Green, Age: 21, Mill Cove, Nova Scotia. *Private Nathan Lloyd Smith, Age: 27, Porters Lake, Nova Scotia.

The two boards shared personnel information. Canadian Brigadier-General M.J. Dumais was specialist advisor to the Canadian board and co-chair of the American board. The findings of the four-member Canadian Tarnak Farm Board of Inquiry, chaired by General Maurice Baril, were released on June 28, 2002. The Board found that the Canadian troops engaged in the night live-fire exercise had conducted their operations as authorized and in accordance with the established range procedures for the types of weapons fire. The Board concluded that the American F-16 pilots contravened established procedures and were the cause of the incident. The Board further concluded that correcting deficiencies in air coordination and control and tactical planning might have prevented the accident: > \\"... as much as the F-16 pilots bear final responsibility for the fratricide > incident, there existed other systemic shortcomings in air coordination and > control procedures, as well as mission planning practices by the tactical > flying units, that may have prevented the accident had they been > corrected.\\"National Defence Canada. Board of Inquiry . Part IV - Detailed > Findings, p. 45. Retrieved on: March 4, 2008. ==Schmidt's rationale and apology== In his official apology to the family and friends of the dead and injured Canadians, Schmidt stated: ==Article 32 hearing== Colonel Robert Murphy briefs the investigating officer, Colonel Patrick Rosenow (in leather jacket), about a helmet and night vision goggles during the Article 32 hearing. During the Article 32 hearing, five F-16 pilots testified, including one who had led the US Board of Inquiry. All five pilots agreed under oath that the dropping of the bomb by Schmidt was not an unreasonable action. Michael Friscolanti summarized their comments in his book Friendly Fire: :*Major John Milton: A reasonable fighter pilot could have believed he was trapped in a threat envelope and had no choice but to drop a bomb. It was Maj. Schmidt's right to roll in self-defense, even after the \\"hold fire\\" order. :*Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Viets: Rolling in would be a reasonable response because Maj. Schmidt was reasonable to believe that he was already in the threat envelope of a rocket-based weapons system. :*Colonel David C. Nichols: A reasonably prudent F-16 pilot might have done the same thing. \\"Combat aviation is not a science. It's an art.\\" :*Lieutenant Colonel Craig Fisher: There were no \\"significant departures from flight discipline\\". A reasonable fighter pilot would have egressed the area, but that doesn't mean Maj. Schmidt and Maj. Umbach were reckless. :*Major General Stephen T. Sargeant: A reasonable pilot never would have believed that the fire on the ground was a threat to his flight. And even if he did, turning, descending, and decelerating was an unreasonable reaction. However, disregarding all the alleged reckless maneuvers Maj. Schmidt made to reach the spot where he invoked self-defense, dropping a bomb at that instant was not unreasonable. In other words, if Maj. Schmidt suddenly woke up at and four nautical miles (7 km) away from the mystery fire, it would be reasonable to drop a bomb in self- defense.Friscolanti, M., p. 449 One of the issues highlighted by the Inquiry related to the use of amphetamines in combat.Air Force scientists battle aviator fatigueU.S. Pilots Stay Up Taking 'Uppers' Emonson DL, Vanderbeek RD. (1995) The use of amphetamines in U.S. Air Force tactical operations during Desert Shield and Storm. 66(8):802 In testimony it was revealed that Schmidt and Umbach were told by their superiors to use \\"go pills\\" on their missions, and the airmen blamed the incident on the drugs. This was a significant part of the defense of the two pilots. Schmidt's defense also blamed the fog of war. Another issue that was evident, but remained largely in the background, was the quality of communications between the various coalition forces in Afghanistan. ==Disposition== On September 11, 2002, William Umbach and Harry Schmidt were officially charged with four counts of negligent manslaughter, eight counts of aggravated assault, and one count of dereliction of duty. Umbach's charges were later dismissed. Schmidt's charges were reduced on June 30, 2003, to just the dereliction of duty charge. On July 6, 2004, Umbach was reprimanded for leadership failures and allowed to retire. U.S. Lieutenant General Bruce Carlson found Schmidt guilty of dereliction of duty in what the U.S. military calls a \\"non-judicial hearing\\" before a senior officer. He was fined nearly $5,700 in pay and reprimanded. The reprimand, written by Carlson, said Schmidt had \\"flagrantly disregarded a direct order\\", \\"exercised a total lack of basic flight discipline\\", and \\"blatantly ignored the applicable rules of engagement\\". Here is an excerpt from the letter of reprimand given to Schmidt: : \\"You acted shamefully on 17 April 2002 over Tarnak Farms, Afghanistan, exhibiting arrogance and a lack of flight discipline. When your flight lead warned you to \\"make sure it's not friendlies\\" and the Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft controller directed you to \\"stand by\\" and later to \\"hold fire\\", you should have marked the location with your targeting pod. Thereafter, if you believed, as you stated, you and your leader were threatened, you should have taken a series of evasive actions and remained at a safe distance to await further instructions from AWACS. Instead, you closed on the target and blatantly disobeyed the direction to \\"hold fire.\\" Your failure to follow that order is inexcusable. I do not believe you acted in defense of Major Umbach or yourself. Your actions indicate that you used your self-defense declaration as a pretext to strike a target, which you rashly decided was an enemy firing position, and about which you had exhausted your patience in waiting for clearance from the Combined Air Operations Center to engage. You used the inherent right of self-defense as an excuse to wage your own war.\\"CBC News Online (July 6, 2004). \\"U.S. Air Force Verdict\\". In April 2006, Schmidt sued the USAF, saying that the military violated the federal Privacy Act by disclosing parts of his military record without his permission and by doing so ruined his reputation. On September 22, 2007, U.S. District Judge Jeanne Scott ruled against Schmidt, stating, \\"The release of Schmidt's reprimand gave the public ... insight into the way in which the United States government was holding its pilot accountable. Thus considering all of the circumstances, the disclosures at issue were clearly warranted.\\"Associated Press, \\"Pilot Loses Lawsuit In Friendly Fire Case\\", September 23, 2007 This was the most serious case of fratricide or friendly fire to have been experienced by the Canadian Forces (CF) in Coalition operations since the Korean War. == Legacy == Private Green's mother, Doreen Coolen, was chosen by the Royal Canadian Legion to be the Silver Cross Mother for the Remembrance Day ceremony in Ottawa in 2002.

The line descended from Alexander, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg. Like all of the secondary lines from the Sonderburg branch, the heads of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg were first known as Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein and Dukes of Sonderburg. The family took its name from its ancestral home, Augustenborg Palace in Augustenborg, Denmark. ==History== Duke Ernst Günther I, first Duke of Augustenborg (1609-1689). Auguste, the first Duchess of Augustenborg (1633-1701). The branch originated from Ernest Günther, a member of the ducal house of Schleswig-Holstein (its branch of Sønderborg) and a cadet of the royal house of Denmark. He was the third son of Alexander, 2nd Duke of Sonderborg (1573–1627), and thus a grandson of John the Younger (1545–1622), the first duke, who was a son of King Christian III of Denmark. Ernest Günther had a castle built in the years after 1651, which received the name of Augustenborg in honor of his wife, Auguste. She was also from a branch of the Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein as a daughter of Philip (1584–1663), Duke of Glücksburg. As that castle became the chief seat of their line, the family eventually used the name of Augustenborg as its branch name. As they were agnates of the ducal house, the title of duke belonged to every one of them (as is the Germanic custom). The Dukes of Augustenborg were not sovereign rulers—they held their lands in fief to their dynastically-senior kinsmen, the sovereign Dukes of Schleswig and Holstein—who were the Oldenburg Kings of Denmark. Later, a Danish king made the head of that line specifically Duke of Augustenborg. In the late 18th century, since 1764, the branch of Schleswig-Holsten-Sønderborg-Augustenborg was genealogically the next senior branch immediately after the main line of Danish kings. King Frederick VI of Denmark (or, rather, his chief adviser Andreas Peter Bernstorff), made his only sister Louise Auguste of Denmark marry the then Hereditary Prince Christian of Augustenborg. In 1764, Sønderborg castle, the seat of that elder Schleswig-Holstein branch, passed upon its owners' extinction into the hands of the Duke of Augustenborg, but against expectations it did not became a residence (they remained at Augustenborg). Instead it was rented out as a warehouse. The penultimate Duke of Augustenborg, also named Ernst Günther, allowed Sønderborg County Museum to move into a part of the castle in 1920. The next year the Danish state bought the castle from the Duke. In 1810, a younger scion of the family, Prince Christian August, was chosen as the Crown Prince of Sweden, and adopted by king Charles XIII of Sweden. An Augustenborg dynasty on a royal throne was however not to be, as Prince Christian August died a couple of months after his arrival in Sweden. In the early 19th century, the Danish royal line started to go extinct. The Duke of Augustenborg was the next male-line heir to the royal house, though not descended in male line from Frederick III of Denmark and Norway. This made the duke a player in the convoluted Schleswig-Holstein Question, as well as a candidate in the Danish succession. Frederik August of Augustenborg attempted to proclaim himself reigning Duke Frederick VIII of Schleswig-Holstein in 1864, upon the final extinction of the senior branch of the Danish kings. His daughter, Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, became German Empress as consort of Wilhelm II. The ducal line died out in 1931. In November 1920, its penultimate head had adopted Prince Johann Georg of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg- Glücksburg and his sister Princess Marie Luise, children of Prince Albrecht of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. After Augustenborg's extinction in 1931, seniority fell to the line of the Dukes of Glücksburg, heads of the second line of Holstein, known in German as Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg- Glücksburg and in Danish as Slesvig-Holsten-Sønderborg-Lyksborg. ==List of Dukes== ;Dukes of Augustenborg *Ernest Günther, 1647–1689 *Frederick (1689–1692), son *Ernest August (1692–1731), brother *Christian August (1731–1754), nephew *Frederik Christian I (1754–1794), son *Frederik Christian II (1794–1814), son *Christian August II (1814–1869), son ;Dukes of Schleswig- Holstein *Frederik VIII August (1863–1880), son :Frederick proclaimed himself Duke of Schleswig-Holstein in 1863, but did not obtain sovereign possession. *Ernest Günther (1880–1921), son *Albert (1921–1931), cousin Like the kings of the earlier Oldenburg line, of which the House of Glücksburg is a cadet branch, monarchs of the Glücksburg dynasty in Denmark also bore the titles of Dukes of Schleswig and Holstein.

The statement is that a particle need not be detected in order for a quantum measurement to occur, and that the lack of a particle detection can also constitute a measurement. The thought experiment was first posed in 1953 by Mauritius Renninger. It can be understood to be a refinement of the paradox presented in the Mott problem. ==The Mott problem== The Mott problem concerns the paradox of reconciling the spherical wave function describing the emission of an alpha ray by a radioactive nucleus, with the linear tracks seen in a cloud chamber. Formulated in 1929 by Sir Nevill Francis Mott and Werner Heisenberg, it was resolved by a calculation done by Mott that showed that the correct quantum mechanical system must include the wave functions for the atoms in the cloud chamber as well as that for the alpha ray. The calculation showed that the resulting probability is non-zero only on straight lines raying out from the decayed atom; that is, once the measurement is performed, the wave-function becomes non-vanishing only near the classical trajectory of a particle. ==Renninger's negative-result experiment== In the Renninger formulation, the cloud chamber is replaced by a pair of hemispherical particle detectors, completely surrounding a radioactive atom at the center that is about to decay by emitting an alpha ray. For the purposes of the thought experiment, the detectors are assumed to be 100% efficient, so that the emitted alpha ray is always detected. By consideration of the normal process of quantum measurement, it is clear that if one detector registers the decay, then the other will not: a single particle cannot be detected by both detectors. The core observation is that the non-observation of a particle on one of the shells is just as good a measurement as detecting it on the other. The strength of the paradox can be heightened by considering the two hemispheres to be of different diameters; with the outer shell a good distance farther away. In this case, after the non-observation of the alpha ray on the inner shell, one is led to conclude that the (originally spherical) wave function has \\"collapsed\\" to a hemisphere shape, and (because the outer shell is distant) is still in the process of propagating to the outer shell, where it is guaranteed to eventually be detected. In the standard quantum-mechanical formulation, the statement is that the wave-function has partially collapsed, and has taken on a hemispherical shape. The full collapse of the wave function, down to a single point, does not occur until it interacts with the outer hemisphere. The conundrum of this thought experiment lies in the idea that the wave function interacted with the inner shell, causing a partial collapse of the wave function, without actually triggering any of the detectors on the inner shell. This illustrates that wave function collapse can occur even in the absence of particle detection. ==Common objections== There are a number of common objections to the standard interpretation of the experiment. Some of these objections, and standard rebuttals, are listed below. ===Finite radioactive lifetime=== It is sometimes noted that the time of the decay of the nucleus cannot be controlled, and that the finite half- life invalidates the result. This objection can be dispelled by sizing the hemispheres appropriately with regards to the half-life of the nucleus. The radii are chosen so that the more distant hemisphere is much farther away than the half-life of the decaying nucleus, times the flight-time of the alpha ray. To lend concreteness to the example, assume that the half-life of the decaying nucleus is 0.01 microsecond (most elementary particle decay half-lives are much shorter; most nuclear decay half-lives are much longer; some atomic electromagnetic excitations have a half-life about this long). If one were to wait 0.4 microseconds, then the probability that the particle will have decayed will be 1-2^{-40}\\\\simeq1-10^{-12}; that is, the probability will be very very close to one. The outer hemisphere is then placed at (speed of light) times (0.4 microseconds) away: that is, at about 120 meters away. The inner hemisphere is taken to be much closer, say at 1 meter. If, after (for example) 0.3 microseconds, one has not seen the decay product on the inner, closer, hemisphere, one can conclude that the particle has decayed with almost absolute certainty, but is still in-flight to the outer hemisphere. The paradox then concerns the correct description of the wave function in such a scenario. ===Classical trajectories=== Another common objection states that the decay particle was always travelling in a straight line, and that only the probability of the distribution is spherical. This, however, is a mis- interpretation of the Mott problem, and is false. The wave function was truly spherical, and is not the incoherent superposition (mixed state) of a large number of plane waves. The distinction between mixed and pure states is illustrated more clearly in a different context, in the debate comparing the ideas behind local hidden variables and their refutation by means of the Bell inequalities. ===Diffraction=== A true quantum-mechanical wave would diffract from the inner hemisphere, leaving a diffraction pattern to be observed on the outer hemisphere. This is not really an objection, but rather an affirmation that a partial collapse of the wave function has occurred. If a diffraction pattern were not observed, one would be forced to conclude that the particle had collapsed down to a ray, and stayed that way, as it passed the inner hemisphere; this is clearly at odds with standard quantum mechanics. Diffraction from the inner hemisphere is expected. ===Complex decay products=== In this objection, it is noted that in real life, a decay product is either spin-1/2 (a fermion) or a photon (spin-1). This is taken to mean that the decay is not truly sphere symmetric, but rather has some other distribution, such as a p-wave. However, on closer examination, one sees this has no bearing on the spherical symmetry of the wave-function. Even if the initial state could be polarized; for example, by placing it in a magnetic field, the non-spherical decay pattern is still properly described by quantum mechanics. ===Non-relativistic language=== The above formulation is inherently phrased in a non-relativistic language; and it is noted that elementary particles have relativistic decay products. This objection only serves to confuse the issue. The experiment can be reformulated so that the decay product is slow-moving. At any rate, special relativity is not in conflict with quantum mechanics. ===Imperfect detectors=== This objection states that in real life, particle detectors are imperfect, and sometimes neither the detectors on the one hemisphere, nor the other, will go off. This argument only serves to confuse the issue, and has no bearing on the fundamental nature of the wave-function. ==See also== *Interaction-free measurement *Elitzur–Vaidman bomb-tester ==References== * Mauritius Renninger, Messungen ohne Storung des Messobjekts (Measurement without disturbance of the measured objects), Zeitschrift für Physik, 1960; 158(4): 417-421. * Mauritius Renninger, (1953) Zeitschrift für Physik, 136 p 251 * Louis de Broglie, The Current Interpretation of Wave Mechanics, (1964) Elsevier, Amsterdam.

The term is frequently extended to the case of metal-to-metal charge transfer between non-equivalent metal centres. http://goldbook.iupac.org/I03125.html Article: intervalence charge transfer Typically, such a process produces a characteristic absorption in the electromagnetic spectrum of the compound involved. The phenomenon is most often observed in mixed-valence bi- and polymetallic coordination complexes. The IVCT band is usually observed in the visible or near infrared region of the spectrum and is broad. The process can be described as follows: :LnM+-bridge-M'Ln \\\\+ hν → LnM-bridge-M'+Ln where L is a ligand. ==Mixed valency and the IT band== Since the energy states of valence tautomers affect the IVCT band, the strength of electronic interaction between the sites, known as α (the mixing coefficient), can be determined by analysis of the IVCT band.G. L. Miessler and D. A. Tarr “Inorganic Chemistry” 3rd Ed, Pearson/Prentice Hall publisher, . Depending on the value of α, mixed valence complexes are classified into three groups: *class I: α ~ 0, the complex has no interaction between redox sites. No IVCT band is observed. The oxidation states of the two metal sites are distinct and do not readily interconvert. *class II: 0 < α < \\\\scriptstyle 1/\\\\sqrt{2} = 0.707, intermediate interaction between sites.

It is better to consider these sites as one united site, not as two isolated sites. An IVCT band is observed. The oxidation states of the two metal sites are essentially equivalent.

Like its predecessor Thief: The Dark Project, the game follows Garrett, a master thief who works in and around a steampunk metropolis called the City. The player assumes the role of Garrett as he unravels a conspiracy related to a new religious sect. Garrett takes on missions such as burglaries and frameups, while trying to avoid detection by guards and automated security. Thief II was designed to build on the foundation of its predecessor. In response to feedback from players of Thief, the team placed a heavy focus on urban stealth in the sequel, and they minimized the use of monsters and maze-like levels. The game was made with the third iteration of the Dark Engine, which had been used previously to develop Thief and System Shock 2. Thief II was announced at the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo, as part of an extended contract between Looking Glass and Eidos to release games in the Thief series. Looking Glass neared bankruptcy as the game was developed, and the company was kept running by advances from Eidos. Thief II received positive reviews from critics, and its initial sales were stronger than those of its predecessor. However, the game's royalties were processed slowly, which compounded Looking Glass's financial troubles. As a result, the company closed in May 2000, with plans for Thief III cancelled. The third game in the series, entitled Thief: Deadly Shadows, was developed by Ion Storm and published by Eidos in 2004. Thief 2X: Shadows of the Metal Age, a widely praised expansion mod for Thief II, was released in 2005. In 2014, Square Enix published a reboot of the series, developed by Eidos Montréal. ==Gameplay== blackjack and hides in a shadow from a patrolling guard.

Thief II is a stealth game that takes place from a first-person perspective in a three-dimensional (3D) graphical environment. The player seeks to complete mission objectives and to evade the notice of opponents such as guards. The player must minimize the visibility and audibility of the player character, Garrett, to escape detection. Players try to avoid lit areas and loud flooring in favor of shadows and quiet flooring. A light monitor on the heads-up display (HUD) indicates the player character's visibility. While it is possible for the player character to engage in direct combat, he is easily defeated. The game's 15 missions take place in large levels that can be confronted in multiple ways. Guards may be knocked out with a blackjack or killed with a bow or sword, and their fallen bodies may be picked up and hidden. In addition to human enemies, the game features security automatons and surveillance cameras. While completing objectives such as frameups and blackmail, the player steals valuables that may be used to purchase thieving gear between missions. The player's main tools are specialized arrows, including water arrows to douse lights, moss arrows to dampen the player character's footsteps and rope arrows to reach higher ground. Thief II is designed to be played methodically, and the player plans ahead by scouting, reading the game's map and observing patrol patterns. The player character has a zooming mechanical eye, which connects to throwable \\"Scouting Orb\\" cameras. One Scouting Orb may be deployed at a time; when it lands, the player views the game world from its perspective until normal play is resumed. The player listens for noises, such as footsteps and humming, to determine the locations of enemies. On the highest of the game's three difficulty levels, killing humans results in a game over, and in certain missions the player must not knock out any guards. ==PlotSetting and characters=== Like its predecessor Thief: The Dark Project, Thief II is set in a steampunk metropolis called the City, whose appearance resembles that of both medieval and Victorian era cities. Magic and steam technology exist side by side, and three factions—the manipulative and enigmatic Keepers, the technology-focused Hammerites and the \\"pagan\\" worshippers of the Pan-like Trickster god—are in operation. Thief II takes place one year after the first game. In the aftermath of the Trickster's defeat and the failure of his plan to revert the world to a wild, primitive state, a schism in the Hammerite religion spawns the \\"Mechanist\\" sect, which fanatically values technological progress. The new inventions of the Mechanists are used by a resurgent police force to crack down on crime. The pagans are in disarray, and have been driven into the wilderness beyond the City. From there, they engage in guerrilla warfare against the Mechanists. The Keeper faction is dormant as the game begins. The game continues the story of Garrett (voiced by Stephen Russell), the cynical master thief who defeated the Trickster. Pursuing Garrett is the new sheriff, Gorman Truart (voiced by Sam Babbitt), who has imposed a zero tolerance policy on crime. Viktoria (voiced by Terri Brosius), the former ally of the Trickster, eventually joins with Garrett to combat the Mechanists. The game's primary antagonist is the founder of the Mechanists, Father Karras (also voiced by Russell), a mentally unstable inventor who despises the natural world. ===Story=== The game begins as Garrett continues his life as a thief. However, he is betrayed by his fence and ambushed after an early mission, and he determines that Truart, the local sheriff, is hunting him. Keepers take Garrett to hear a prophecy about the \\"Metal Age\\", which he ignores. As Garrett leaves, one of the Keepers informs him that Truart had been hired to kill him, and he gives Garrett a letter that directs him to eavesdrop on a Mechanist meeting. There, Garrett overhears Truart and Father Karras discussing the conversion of street people into mindless \\"Servants\\", who wear masks that emit a red vapor capable of reducing themselves and nearby humans to rust. Truart promises to provide Karras with twenty victims for the Servant project, not realizing that Karras is recording his words for use in blackmail. Garrett steals the recording from a safe deposit box, in order to coerce Truart into revealing his employer. However, Garrett finds Truart murdered at his estate. Evidence at the crime scene leads him to spy on the police officer Lt. Mosley. Garrett sees Mosley deliver a suspicious letter, which is carried through a portal by a wounded pagan. Garrett enters the portal and finds himself outside the City, and he follows the pagan's trail of blood to Viktoria, who persuades Garrett to join her against the Mechanists. On a lead from Viktoria, he infiltrates Karras' office to learn about the \\"Cetus Project\\", and inadvertently discovers that Karras is giving Servants to the City's nobles. Garrett travels to a Mechanist base to find out more about the Cetus Project, which is revealed to be a submarine. In order to locate and kidnap a high-ranking Mechanist named Brother Cavador, Garrett stows away in the vehicle. After delivering Cavador to Viktoria, Garrett steals a Servant mask to learn about a Mechanist technology called a \\"Cultivator\\". Meanwhile, Karras hides inside the Mechanist cathedral in preparation for his plan. Garrett and Viktoria learn that it is the Cultivators inside Servant masks which emit red vapor, or \\"rust gas\\". Karras had provided Servants to nobles with gardens in order to set off an apocalyptic chain reaction. Viktoria plans to lure the Servants into the hermetically sealed Mechanist cathedral before Karras activates their masks, but Garrett believes this to be too dangerous and leaves. Viktoria goes to the cathedral alone and dies while filling it with plants, and Garrett completes her plan, killing Karras in the rust gas. Afterward, Garrett is approached by a Keeper who explains that Karras' scheme and Viktoria's death had been prophesied. Garrett demands to know the rest of the Keepers' prophecies as the game ends. ==DevelopmentEarly production=== Looking Glass Studios began designing Thief II in January 1999. The team's goal was to build on the foundation of Thief: The Dark Project, a game that Thief II project director Steve Pearsall later said was an experiment. He explained that the team had played it safe by including certain \\"exploration ... or adventure oriented\\" missions with \\"jumping and climbing puzzles\\" in Thief, and that the new game was significantly more focused on stealth. Combat was given less prominence than in the original. Based on feedback from players and reviewers of Thief, the team decided to scale back the use of maze-like levels and monsters such as zombies in favor of urban environments and human enemies. Pearsall stated that Thiefs monsters were negatively received because, unlike the game's human enemies, they did not clearly indicate when they noticed the player. The team sought to remedy this problem by improving the audio cues given by non-human enemies in the sequel. Production of Thief II commenced in February. Looking Glass chose to compose the game's team of \\"half the original designers and half new blood\\", according to executive producer James Poole. The company tried to select people who meshed well both personally and creatively, in an attempt to guarantee a smooth development cycle. Adrenaline Vault editor-in-chief Emil Pagliarulo was hired as a junior designer, in part because of his positive review of Thief. Rich \\"zdim\\" Carlson and Iikka Keränen joined from Ion Storm's Daikatana team, and Looking Glass contractor Terri Brosius was hired as a full-time designer. One-third of the team was female, which Pearsall believed contributed to a strong group dynamic. As was typical at Looking Glass, the Thief II team worked in a wall-less space called a \\"pit\\", which allowed them to converse easily. Describing the work environment at the time, writer Laura Baldwin noted that \\"conversations dash madly about the room, [and] when someone is demonstrating something interesting everyone gravitates over to look.\\" During the first months of development, the team regularly gathered to watch films pertinent to Garrett's character and to the game's visual design, such as The Third Man, The Castle of Cagliostro, M and Metropolis. Pearsall said that the latter two films were Thief IIs \\"biggest aesthetic influences\\", while the main inspiration for its plot was Umberto Eco's novel The Name of the Rose. The team also drew influence from Fritz Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. The game's story was written in the three-act structure: Garrett was intended to transition from his \\"cynical self\\" in the first act to a private investigator in the second, and to a character similar to James Bond in the third. The City's technology and architecture were influenced by the appearance of Victorian London, and certain areas were given an Art Deco theme to provide \\"sort of a Batman feel\\", in reference to the 1989 film. Lead artist Mark Lizotte captured over two-thousand photographs during his vacation in Europe, and these were the basis for many of the game's textures. Thief II was built with the third iteration of the Dark Engine, which had been used previously for Thief and System Shock 2. According to Pearsall, the Dark Engine had become \\"a very well understood development environment\\", which made for an easier production process. Engine updates created for System Shock 2, such as support for 16-bit color, were carried over to Thief II. The average character model in Thief II was given close to double the polygons of the average model in Thief, with much of the added detail focused on characters' heads. This was an attempt to give the characters a \\"more organic\\" look. Certain artificial intelligence (AI) routines written into the Dark Engine, which allowed enemies to notice changes in the environment such as open doors, had not been used in Thief or in System Shock 2 but were implemented in Thief II. Weather effects such as fog and rain were added, and technology from Flight Unlimited III was used to generate the sky and clouds. ===Announcement and continued development=== Thief II was announced during the Electronic Entertainment Expo on May 13, 1999, as part of a contract between Looking Glass and Eidos Interactive to release four new games in the Thief series, beginning with Thief Gold. The deal had been signed on May 7, roughly three months after Thief II entered production. A tech demo of the game, which Bruce Geryk of Games Domain described as \\"about three rooms with some Mages\\", was displayed on the show floor. The demo was used to showcase the updated Dark Engine, which featured support for colored lighting, higher polygon models and larger environments. The team revealed their intention to include more levels with human enemies, and announced a projected release date of spring 2000. Plans to include a cooperative multiplayer mode were also detailed at the show. IGN's Jason Bates noted that the Thief II display attracted \\"a bit of a buzz and a small crowd of dedicated onlookers\\". By July, the team had begun initial construction of the game's levels. Thief IIs increased focus on stealth necessitated new level design concepts: the most stealth-based missions in Thief had centered on urban burglary, but Pearsall explained that this \\"would get tired pretty fast\\" if repeated in every level. The team diversified Thief II by designing missions with such objectives as kidnapping, blackmail and eavesdropping. The first two levels were designed to seamlessly introduce new players to the core game mechanics, without a tutorial mission that might lose the interest of experienced players. When creating a mission, the team would often begin by deciding on the player's objective, after which they would produce a rough level design. The mission would then undergo a peer review to determine if it should be added to the game. Each of the game's levels was a team effort rather than the work of a single designer. Designer Randy Smith explained that, while Thiefs levels had been designed to fit a pre-existing story, the Thief II team \\"tried to think of really good missions first\\" and then adjusted the plot to suit them. He noted that it was highly difficult to harmonize the two. The game's sound team was composed of Kemal Amarasingham, Damin Djawadi and audio director Eric Brosius. According to Brosius, each member of the audio department did \\"everything\\", without clear demarcations between roles. Like Thief, Thief II features a sound engine that simulates propagation in real-time. To achieve this effect, each level's geometry was input both to the level editor and to a \\"separate [sound] database\\", which mapped how sound would realistically propagate based on \\"the physical room characteristics [... and] how all the different rooms and areas are connected together\\". For example, noise travels freely through an open door but is blocked when the door is closed. The team used the new \\"occlusion\\" feature in EAX 2.0 to make Thief IIs sound environment more realistic and to allow the player to listen through doors. The game features more sound effects, music and speech than the original Thief. Thief IIs score, as with that of its predecessor, was designed to \\"blur ambient [sound] and music\\" together. However, Brosius later stated that, while Thiefs soundtrack is composed of \\"simple and hypnotic\\" loops only a few seconds in length, Thief II features longer and \\"more thoughtfully\\" constructed pieces. He believed that this method had positive aspects, but that it resulted in a less immersive audio environment. Artist Dan Thron returned to create the game's cutscenes, with assistance from Jennifer Hrabota-Lesser. Thron later called Hrabota-Lesser \\"one of the greatest artists I've ever seen\\". The cutscenes, which Computer Games Magazine called \\"unique\\", feature multiple layers of artwork and footage of live actors filmed against a green screen. These components were combined and animated in Adobe After Effects. The technique had been developed for the original Thief, as an evolution of designer Ken Levine's suggestion to use motion comic cutscenes. David Lynch's films Eraserhead and The Elephant Man were important influences on their style. ===Final months=== By October 1999, the team had cut the game's multiplayer feature. Pearsall explained that Looking Glass did not \\"have the resources to do a new kind of multiplayer and ship a finely tuned single-player game\\". Plans were announced in January 2000 to release a multiplayer-only Thief game shortly after the completion of Thief II. As Thief IIs development continued, Looking Glass experienced extreme financial troubles. The company's Marc LeBlanc later said that \\"Eidos was writing a check every week to cover our burn rate\\" during the last months of the project. The game's final cost was roughly $2.5 million. According to company head Paul Neurath, Eidos informed Looking Glass that \\"it was not an option\\" for Thief II to miss its release date, and that there would be \\"dire consequences if [we] missed by even a day\\". An anonymous Looking Glass staffer later told Salon.com that Eidos \\"told us basically to ship [Thief II] by their fiscal quarter or die\\". By January, Pearsall confirmed that the game had reached beta, and that most of the team's energy was being spent \\"tuning, polishing, and fixing bugs\\". He noted in early February that Thief II had been produced almost entirely on schedule. The company slipped behind near the end of the project and entered crunch time to make up the loss. On February 24, Thief II producer Michael McHale announced that the game had reached \\"feature freeze\\", and that the team was in \\"super crunch mode\\". Numerous game testers from Eidos joined the project. However, McHale said that the team was energized and that \\"spirits [were] high\\". Certain employees slept in the office and avoided bathing so that the game could reach its March deadline. LeBlanc later stated his belief that the game was rushed, and that its quality suffered as a result. Nevertheless, the team met their goal, and the game was released on March 23, 2000. Eidos expedited the company's payment for completing the game. ==Reception== Thief 2 debuted high on the bestsellers list for computer games, and its initial sales were better than those of its commercially successful predecessor. By November 2000, its global sales had surpassed 220,000 copies; PC Zone described these figures as \\"commercial acclaim.\\" The United States alone accounted for 67,084 sales by the end of 2000, which drew in revenues of $2.37 million. The game later received a \\"Silver\\" sales award by the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Thief II also received positive reviews from critics, with an aggregate score of 87/100 on Metacritic. Computer Gaming Worlds Thomas L. McDonald wrote that \\"everything in Thief II is bigger, sharper, better, and more effective\\" than in its predecessor. He enjoyed its story and called its levels \\"vast and intricate\\", with \\"astonishingly complex and often beautiful\\" architecture; but he found the game's graphics to be somewhat lackluster. McDonald summarized Thief II as a unique \\"gamer's game\\". Jim Preston of PC Gamer US considered the game to be \\"more focused and polished than the original\\", and he praised the removal of \\"zombie battles\\". While he faulted its graphics, he summarized it as \\"one hell of a good game\\". Jasen Torres of GameFan wrote, \\"If you liked Thief, you'll love Thief 2: The Metal Age; it's more of the stuff that made Thief great, with less of the annoying stuff\\". He applauded the removal of \\"zombie killer\\" missions and believed the game's sound to be \\"superior to any other game\\". He considered its story to be \\"good\\" but \\"nothing great\\" and its graphics to be \\"decent\\"; but he commented that the game was \\"really all about the gameplay\\", which he praised as \\"quite compelling and fun\\". Benjamin E. Sones of Computer Games Magazine considered the game's story to be \\"quite good\\", but he faulted Looking Glass for failing to detail the events of the first game for new players. He wrote that Thief IIs graphics were passable but that its sound design was \\"phenomenal\\". Sones praised its missions as \\"very well crafted\\", and noted that they gave the impression of being in \\"a living, breathing world.\\" He summarized, \\"It may not be perfect, but Thief 2 has got it where it counts\\". Charles Harold of The New York Times called the game a \\"refreshing alternative to games that glorify violence\\". He found its story to be \\"slight\\", but he lauded its world as \\"amazingly alive\\" and its AI as a \\"remarkable impersonation of real intelligence\\". Writing for GamePro, Barry Brenesal commented that Thief II \\"provides a solid gaming experience\\" but \\"doesn't startle like its predecessor\\". He wrote that its missions featured a \\"great deal of variety\\", and he praised their \\"ability to casually suggest a much larger world\\", but he complained that they were linear. He considered the game's writing to be \\"among the best in the business\\". While Brenesal enjoyed the game's textures and lighting, he noted the low detail of the game's human models, whose animations he found to be \\"arthritic\\". PC Zones Paul Presley wrote that the game's levels were larger but easier than those of Thief, and he considered their objectives to be somewhat linear. He found Thief IIs graphics to be dated and wrote that its lack of real-time lighting \\"tends to give each environment a sort of 'false' quality\\". However, he believed that the game \\"still has enough atmosphere to immerse you\\", and he praised its sound design. Presley considered the game to be a straightforward rehash of its predecessor, and he finished, \\"A more clear-cut case of sequel-itis there has never been.\\" Jim Preston reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Great, skulking gameplay, useful new tools, and clever level design make Thief II an excellent first-person 'sneaker.'\\" ==Post-release== While Thief II performed well commercially, Looking Glass was not set to receive royalties for several months. The company had struggled financially since the commercial failures of its self-published games Terra Nova: Strike Force Centauri and British Open Championship Golf. Looking Glass's Flight Unlimited III had flopped at retail, and the development of Jane's Attack Squadron had gone over budget and fallen behind schedule. A deal to co-develop the stealth game Deep Cover with Irrational Games had recently collapsed. According to Looking Glass's Tim Stellmach, the delay in Thief II royalties \\"faced [us] with the prospect of running out of money.\\" Looking Glass management signed a deal in which Eidos Interactive would acquire the company, but Eidos fell into a sudden financial crisis, in part because of the failure of Ion Storm's $40 million game Daikatana. These factors led to the closure of Looking Glass on May 24, 2000, with the planned Thief II successors Thief II Gold and Thief III cancelled. ===Sequels=== The Thief series had been planned as a trilogy, and work on Thief III was \\"in a fairly advanced stage\\" when Looking Glass closed, according to PC Zones Keith Pullin. Randy Smith and Terri Brosius were appointed as lead designers, and they developed the game's concept over several months. In an open letter published after the company's bankruptcy, Smith wrote that the third game would have taken place in an \\"open-ended, self-directed city\\", and that its plot would have centered on the Keepers. Brosius suggested that Thief III would have seen Garrett \\"accept[ing] that there are consequences to his actions\\", and that he would likely have become \\"ready to give, rather than always take.\\" The player would have uncovered the game's story gradually, while exploring a free-roam environment. Serious plans had been made to include co-operative multiplayer, and a new engine, Siege, had been in production. When Looking Glass closed, its assets were liquidated and the Thief intellectual property was sold at auction. This raised doubts that the Thief trilogy would be completed, a situation that Salon.com writer Wagner James Au compared to Lucasfilm closing after the release of The Empire Strikes Back. However, following rumors, Eidos announced on August 9, 2000 that it had purchased the rights to Thief. Development of Thief III was delegated to the Warren Spector-supervised Ion Storm, which had recently completed Deus Ex. According to Spector, Thief III would have been given to Core Design or Crystal Dynamics had he not accepted it. The game was announced for Windows and the PlayStation 2. On August 10, Spector commented that Ion Storm's first goal was to assemble a core team, composed in part of former Looking Glass employees, to design and plot the game. Thief II team members Randy Smith, Lulu Lamer, Emil Pagliarulo and Terri Brosius were hired to begin the project. On August 16, Ion Storm announced its hires, and stated that concept work on Thief III would begin in September. The team planned to \\"wrap up [the] loose ends\\" of the series, and they built directly upon the Thief III concept work done at Looking Glass. Thief III was eventually renamed Thief: Deadly Shadows, and it was released for Windows and the Xbox on May 25, 2004. In May 2009, after several months of rumors, a fourth game in the Thief series was announced by Deus Ex: Human Revolution developer Eidos Montréal. It was unveiled in the April 2013 issue of Game Informer. The game, entitled Thief, is a reboot of the Thief series; and it does not feature the Hammerites, pagans or Keepers. Its plot follows Garrett (voiced by Romano Orzari in place of Stephen Russell) in the aftermath of an accident that leaves his protégé, Erin, missing. Garrett has amnesia after this incident, and the City is beset by a plague called the Gloom. The game was released for Windows and the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in February 2014. ===Fan expansion=== Soon after the bankruptcy of Looking Glass, a fan group called the Dark Engineering Guild began developing an expansion mod to Thief II, entitled Thief 2X: Shadows of the Metal Age. Initially, they hoped to fill the void left by the cancellation of Thief III, but they continued to work on the mod after the announcement and release of Thief: Deadly Shadows. Released in 2005 after five years in development, the mod follows Zaya, a young woman who is robbed while visiting the City and who then seeks revenge. She is mentored by a pagan hermit named Malak, who trains her as a thief but who has ulterior motives. The team designed Zaya to be physically capable and to have a \\"middle-eastern/north-african look\\", but made an effort to avoid similarities to Mulan. Chronologically, the story starts near the end of Thief and ends in the middle of Thief II, thereby depicting the rise of Gorman Truart and the early days of the Mechanists. Thief 2X features 13 missions, with new animated cutscenes and roughly 3,000 new lines of recorded dialogue. The mod was praised by critics and by the Thief fan community. Brett Todd of PC Gamer US awarded it \\"Mod of the Month\\" and wrote: \\"It doesn't quite have the mysterious allure of the original games, but it's awfully close\\". A writer for Jolt Online Gaming praised the mod's visuals and considered its missions to be \\"incredibly well designed\\". While the writer commented that Thief 2X did not perfectly follow the series' tone and that its voice acting was \\"not the best\\", they finished by saying that fans of the Thief series had \\"no excuse not to play T2X\\". PC Gamer UKs Kieron Gillen wrote that he had expected the mod to be cancelled, given that the \\"web is full of [...] five-percent finished masterworks from people who aimed far, far too high\\". After Thief 2Xs release, he lauded it as the best Thief fan work and as \\"one of the most impressive achievements of any fan community for any game\\". ==See also== * The Dark Mod * Emergent gameplay * Immersive sim ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:2000 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Eidos Interactive games Category:Looking Glass Studios games Category:Stealth video games Category:Steampunk video games Category:Thief (series) Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Thief II"},{"id":"2204796","text":"Martin Hederos is a founding member of Nymphet Noodlers and The Soundtrack of Our Lives.

It was founded in 1920 by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet and is sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph. The college is broadly divided into four schools: the School of Arts and Humanities (which includes the Music, Art, and Communications Departments), the School of Mathematics and Sciences, the Huether School of Business, and the Thelma P. Lally School of Education. These schools offer a combined total of over 100 degrees at the certificate, undergraduate, and graduate levels. ==History== The idea for The College of Saint Rose was conceived by Monsignor Joseph A. Delaney, the vicar general of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany in 1920. He aimed to create a Catholic college for women in the area between the two nearest Catholic colleges in New York City and Buffalo. With this in mind, Delaney contacted Sr. Blanche Rooney, a member of the local chapter of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet, located in the Provincial House on Eighth Street in Troy, New York. Rooney and her sisters were receptive to the idea and, with the permission and support of Bishop of Albany Edmund F. Gibbons and Sr. Rooney, Monsignor Delaney purchased the William Keeler estate at 979 Madison Avenue. Upon granting of a provisional charter from the Board of Regents, The College of Saint Rose was established as a college for women with a liberal arts curriculum in Albany, New York on June 28, 1920.Manory, RoseMarie. Of Glory, Of Praise: A 75-Year History of The College of Saint Rose. Albany, New York: The College of Saint Rose, 1994. p. 4-5. Its founders selected the name of Saint Rose to honor the first canonized saint in the Americas, Saint Rose of Lima. Initially, emphasis was placed on the professional training of teachers, but it quickly expanded to include preparation for business and other professions. As needs in the Albany area increased, the college expanded and revised its programs to meet those needs. An evening division was developed in 1946 to serve World War II veterans and was re-instituted in 1974 to respond to continuing education needs. In 1949, a graduate school was added to provide master's degree programs. Men were admitted to both the original evening and graduate divisions, and in 1969 the college became fully co-educational. Housing for men became available in the 1970s. In 1970, the board of trustees was expanded to nineteen members, adding ten laypersons in addition to the president and eight Sisters of Saint Joseph. With the transfer of control to this board, The College of Saint Rose became an independent college sponsored by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Carondelet.Manory, Of Glory, Of Praise, p. 147 In December 2015, the college announced plans to eliminate 27 academic programs and 23 faculty positions. The School of Arts and Humanities and the School of Education were hit the hardest, with undergraduate programs like art education and religious studies and graduate programs like history/political science and educational technology being cut from the college. The eliminated programs enrolled just four percent of the student body and 12 programs enrolled none. The move allowed the college to invest in its more popular programs like accounting, communication sciences, music, computer science, criminal justice and forensics, among others. Although the college described the cuts as a necessity to ensure the college's future viability and a \\"reprioritization of academic programs to meet the changing needs of students, increase enrollment and secure the college's financial future\\", faculty protested the plan. Two months later, the faculty passed a \\"no confidence\\" motion in regard to college President Carolyn J. Stefanco, who remained in her post. An investigatory committee of the American Association of University Professors concluded that the layoffs \\"violated shared governance and undermined tenure and academic freedom\\" and that they \\"violated the association's principles and standards\\". ==CampusPine Hills Campus=== The main campus of The College of Saint Rose is located in the Pine Hills neighborhood of Albany, the capital city of New York. The 46-acre campus is bounded by Western Avenue to the north, Partridge Street to the east, Morris Street to the south, and Main Avenue to the west, although there is college property north of Western and east of Partridge. Because of the college's urban location all new expansion of the main Pine Hills campus' footprint occurs either through acquisition of existing structuresHalligan, Lauren (February 14, 2012) Vl. 80, Issue 22 or demolition and construction of new structures.Benjamin, Ian and Branfalt, TG, Jr. (June 18, 2011) Vl. 80, Issue 1 Over the years the college has gradually acquired many of the Victorian-era homes adjacent to the main campus. Many of these structures, most of which are located on Partridge Street and Western and Madison avenues, have been converted into offices and student housing. The slow expansion of the College into the surrounding neighborhood has occasionally led to conflict with local neighborhood and historic conservation associations.Benjamin, Ian (March 2, 2011) Vl. 79, Issue 19Carleo-Evangelist, Jordan (November 4, 2012) Some of this conflict is due to the college's status as a not-for-profit organization in New York State which, as such, is exempt from paying property taxes in the city of Albany. 979 Madison Ave., now known as Moran Hall, was the first building acquired by the college. The first college building was 979 Madison Avenue, a large Victorian-era house that was acquired by the College in 1920 and served as the only College building during the 1920–1921 academic year. The house was known as Saint Rose Hall up until 1970, when the name was changed to Moran Hall in honor of Sister John Joseph Moran. The building is currently occupied by the Alumni Relations office and faculty offices of the History and Political Science Department.Hubert, Brian. Albertus Hall, at 432 Western Avenue, is one of the major academic facilities on the campus, housing many of the classes during the academic year. The brick, steel and stone building was designed by Frank J. Morgan with the aim of creating classroom, laboratory and administrative space for the college. Construction of the building commenced in 1932 and finished in 1933. Renovations in 2006 gave the building its current interior and also added seven new classrooms among other changes. It is connected to the Science Center (993 Madison Avenue) through shared hallways. St. Joseph Hall is a four-story English brick building with limestone trim fronted by six Corinthian columns. It is located at 985 Madison Avenue between the Science Center to the west and Moran Hall to the east. The structure was built in 1922 at a cost of half a million dollars due to a need for classroom and dining space to house the growing student body. As the first academic building constructed specifically for the college, St. Joseph Hall originally included an auditorium, classrooms, chapel, dormitory, a dining area and kitchens in the basement.Manory, Of Glory, Of Praise, P. 7-8 The primary social, dining and restaurant center on the Saint Rose campus is the Events and Athletics Center (EAC), located at 420 Western Avenue. The eastern side of the EAC houses athletic facilities including the Daniel P. Nolan Gymnasium, the Robert Bellizzi Fitness Center, locker rooms, and a four lane swimming pool. The western side contains social and dining facilities such as the Main Dining Room, the Camelot Room, a Starbucks, the Commuter Lounge, the Campus Book Store, the Mail Room and Copy Center, as well as the Offices of Student Affairs, Physical Education, Athletics, Dining Services, the Student Association (SA), and the Student Events Board (SEB). The Massry Center for the Arts features the Kathleen McManus Picotte Recital Hall, the Esther Massry Gallery, and the William Randolph Hearst Music Wing. This building serves as the primary venue for concerts and exhibitions by the college's students and faculty, and a performance and exhibition space for artists, musicians, vocalists and orchestras. The Massry Center is one of the college's most recent and major attempts at building green. Some of the green features of the Massry Center are: * Extra layers of insulation made from shredded trees and paper is sustainable, adds more protection from heat transfer, and reduces energy costs; * Heating and cooling rely on geothermal systems that use constant underground temperatures to control climate; * A daylight harvesting system automatically turns off or dims artificial lights based on amount of natural light in the building; * White and sloped roofs reduce the \\"heat island\\" effect by minimizing absorption of the sun's rays; * Construction materials include 97% recycled drywall, 70 to 90% recycled steel and metal studs, and 18% recycled concrete. Site materials are recycled, reducing the amount of waste at landfills. * Double paned windows for open ventilation; and * Shades in classrooms automatically rise or descend based on light availability. The Massry Center has received a LEED gold award being titled one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the Capital Region. ===Satellite facilities=== The school's Christian Plumeri Sports Complex was constructed at a cost of $4.7 million which included a $1 million challenge contribution from Joe Plumeri, Chairman and CEO of Willis Group Holdings and the college's 2006 commencement speaker. The complex was named in honor of Plumeri's deceased son. Located at the complex, Bellizzi Field was named in honor of former coach Bob Bellizzi. The college's Art and Design program is almost entirely housed in Picotte Hall. Picotte Hall is located at 324 State Street in downtown Albany and, as such, is one of the few buildings owned by the College that are not adjacent to the main campus. The interior of Picotte Hall contains facilities supporting the college's programs in printmaking, sculpture, painting, photography, and graphic design. There are also several general use classrooms. The building was donated by Kathleen McManus Picotte ('34) in 1976 and her husband, Bernard Picotte. ==Organization and administration== Saint Rose is a not-for-profit organization governed by a 36-member Board of Trustees, the Chair of which is Daniel P. Nolan. Per the College By-Laws the Board is composed of two-thirds laypersons, and one third Sisters of Saint Joseph. There are presently eleven Sisters on the Board. Many current and former trustees are or have been notable local business-people, including present members George Randolph Hearst III, vice-president of the Times Union newspaper in Albany, New York,Marvin, Benjamin.

Dr. Carolyn J. Stefanco became the eleventh College president on July 1, 2014. ==Academics== The academic program at the College of Saint Rose consists of four schools: the School of Arts and Humanities (which includes the Music, Art, and Communications Departments), the School of Mathematics and Sciences, the School of Business, and the School of Education. The college operates on a semester schedule. The college offers bachelor's degrees, post-bachelor's certificates, master's degrees, and post- master's certificates. There are 66 bachelor's degree programs offered at Saint Rose, 45 master's degrees, and 12 graduate certificates. ==Athletics== The College of Saint Rose is a Division II member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), offering 18 varsity intercollegiate sports at the NCAA Division II level. p. 9 Shortly before 2000, Saint Rose became a member of the Northeast-10 Conference (NE-10). The school's primary colors are white and gold, but black and gold are used for marketing purposes. The school's NCAA Division II sports teams are referred to as the Golden Knights. This led to controversy when the Vegas Golden Knights joined the National Hockey League in 2017, when the College of Saint Rose raised objections that led to Vegas's trademark application being initially denied, though it was later approved on appeal. In 2009, Saint Rose women's soccer became the third team in Northeast-10 Conference history (1985) to win three consecutive postseason league titles. The team's season record was 24–1, and it was ranked fourth in the United States at season's end. ==Notable faculty and alumniNotable alumni=== * Philip Amelio, actor and teacher * Nicholas Anthony Ascioti, composer and conductor * Glen Barker, former Major League Baseball player later employed by the Houston Astros as Director of Pacific Rim Scouting * Peter Daempfle, science author and educator * Mary Daly, radical feminist philosopher and theologian.

Situated near Sydney's most prominent red-light district in Kings Cross, the Wayside Chapel offers programs and services which attempt to ensure access to health, welfare, social and recreation services. The centre assists homeless people and others on the margins of society.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-05/a-history-of- tying-the-knot-at-the-wayside-chapel/7813904 == Description == The Wayside Chapel's mission is described as \\"creating a community with no 'us' and 'them'\\". Their motto, developed during the leadership of Rev. Graham Long is \\"Love Over Hate\\". Rev. Graham Long described The Wayside Chapel's approach in a 2014 interview as not having \\"any interest at all in solving problems\\". Rather, The Wayside Chapel characterises its approach in the following way: > \\"I don’t want you to be a problem that I have to fix. I want you to be a > person that I can meet. And I think if we meet you’ll change and so will I. > You’ll move towards health and so will I. That’s how it works.\\" ==History== The Wayside Chapel was established in the Kings Cross area of Sydney in 1964.[CC-By-SA] Ted Noffs was the founder of the Wayside Chapel, which was at the time a Methodist ministry (Uniting Church from 1977). At that time, it was only a single room with a dozen chairs in a block of flats at 29 Hughes Street, Potts Point. Within twelve months of his arrival, Noffs had transformed it into a chapel, coffee shop drop-in and community resource centre. The expectations of the church hierarchy—that Noffs's experiment would fail and become obscure and irrelevant—were not realised. The centre grew until it occupied the entire building at No. 29. Later it grew still further and occupied the block of flats adjacent to the first block. A crisis centre was established in 1971 to handle crises which might arise at any time of day or night, including drug overdoses and possible suicides. More conventional church activities such as weddings were also carried out and the Wayside Chapel became one of the most popular wedding venues in Sydney, along with St Mark's at Darling Point. In the late 1990s, Pastor Ray Richmond and others established a \\"Tolerance Room\\", where people who inject drugs were able to do so in a supervised environment, as an act of civil disobedience. This eventually led to the creation of the legal Medically Supervised Injecting Centre in Kings Cross. From 2004-2017 the Pastor of Wayside Chapel was Graham Long.ABC< The current Pastor and CEO of Wayside Chapel is Jon Owen, who has served in the position since July 2018. === New building === In July 2009, the Wayside Chapel received a grant of $2 million from the state government for the purpose of rebuilding its physical facilities. An additional grant from the federal government for $3 million was received in late 2009. The balance of funds were raised by private donation. Graham Long said that rainwater had been penetrating the brick walls and causing bricks to fall out. Forty per cent of the existing buildings had already been condemned, but moves were afoot to start a renovation and rebuilding worth $7.5 million.Daily Telegraph, 7 July 2009, p. 8 On Saturday 19 May 2012 Wayside held the Grand Opening of its newly redeveloped building, designed by Environa Studio, the product of an investment, five years of fundraising and 22 months of construction. The purpose-built facility features a community service centre, café, dedicated program space for The Aboriginal Project and Day-to-Day Living (a program for people with long-term mental health issues), community hall, offices and meeting spaces for groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. The new building also includes a rooftop garden with over 50 varieties of vegetables, fruit, flowers and herbs, along with a bee hive, worm farm and compost. == Service development == Ted Noffs intended the Wayside Chapel to be a place where action came before preaching and engagement with the community was more important than going to church on Sunday. Successive ministers have endeavored to uphold this tradition. Noffs pioneered a number of far-reaching and innovative developments in social welfare at The Wayside Chapel: * The Crisis Centre * The Drug Referral Center * Shepherd of the Streets (SOTS) * Life Education Centre * Relatives Against Intake of Narcotics (REIN) Raymond Richmond was responsible for: * Hands-On Health Centre (initiated by chiropractors in 1992, later closed down) * Supervised Injecting Room Graham Long attempted to develop the mission of \\"creating community with no 'us and them'\\". He described his approach as telling people they are not problems to be solved but rather people to be met. Under Long's leadership the following programs have been implemented: * Aboriginal Project * Day to Day Living Program (for people living with long-term and persistent mental health issues) * Wayside Youth * Community Development ==Current programs and services== * Community Service Centre: The CSC is the first point of contact for visitors and provides showers, clothing and emergency food for the most disadvantaged members of the community. The centre also helps those at their lowest ebb transition to better health and a better life through housing support, referrals to drug and alcohol rehabilitation and steps to manage mental health issues. * Aboriginal Project: Providing a space for specialised, culturally sensitive support, The Aboriginal Project provides opportunities for community members to reconnect with their culture. The project also creates opportunities for leadership, mentoring and positive life choices for those visitors to Wayside who identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. * Wayside Youth: Supporting young people who are at risk, living on or around the streets of Kings Cross, Wayside Youth provides support through a drop in center and street based youth work. The center offers a safe, home environment where young people can come and access laundry and shower facilities. With lounge room, kitchen and activity areas, each area of the program aims to engage and motivate young people as well as provide living skills. * Day to Day Living: Day to Day living is a structured activity program for people experiencing long term and persistent mental health issues. It aims to support people experiencing social isolation and to improve their independence in the community by teaching social skills, developing social networks and promoting confidence. * Community Development: Leveraging the purpose-built spaces in the new building, the Community Development Program is dedicated to creating opportunities for all members of the community to come together for activities and events that will help reduce social isolation and promote togetherness. * Wayside Cafe: The Wayside Café provides low-cost, freshly made meals and beverages in a warm, relaxed and friendly environment. The Café is the busiest and most liveliest part of Wayside, with people from all walks of life coming together for a meal, a coffee or simply to spend time in a safe place where they’re welcome just ‘to be’. While the Café's meals are not free, they are extremely affordable. This is consistent with the greater Wayside mentality of a hand up rather than a handout. * Wayside Op Shop: Packed to the rafters with clothes, jewellery and homewares, the Op Shop is a favourite of people looking for quirky one-offs and affordable designs. In September 2020, Wayside launched Wayside Online Op Shop opening up its retail bricks and mortar via a digital platform for the social enterprise. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Wayside Chapel Site * Ted Noffs Foundation site Category:Uniting Church in Australia Category:Sydney localities Category:Homelessness organizations Category:Kings Cross, New South Wales ","title":"Wayside Chapel"},{"id":"2204813","text":"Mattias Hellberg (born 13 June 1973) is a Swedish musician. Hellberg has worked with a variety of Swedish bands and artists in different genres, both as a permanent member and as guest or session member. ==Recording career== Hellbergs career started when his band Nymphet Noodlers was discovered and later produced by Ebbot from The Soundtrack of our Lives. Wayne Kramer of the MC5 once said that the Nymphet Noddlers was one of his favorite bands. Nymphet Noodlers broke up in 1996, but was reunited for a concert at Way out West August 2011. Former Nymphet colleagues Hederos and Hellberg recorded 8 cover songs meant to be a demo to get gigs in bars in 1996. Old friend Niclas Stenholm released the songs on the album M. Hederos M. Hellberg in 2000. Hederos & Hellberg turned out to be a totally unexpected success. Ryan Adams discovered the duo when he was playing his first concert in Gothenburg, and he brought them with him on a European tour as Hederos & Hellberg's second album, \\"Together in the darkness\\" was released in 2001. January 2003 they did a last performance in a sold out Gothenburg Concert House. After Dregen's departure from The Hellacopters Hellberg was drafted as a live member before Robert Dahlqvist joined as a full-time guitarist. Hellberg later worked with Hellacopters front man Nick Royale and Scott Morgan's soul band The Solution and guitarist Robert Dahlqvist solo effort Thunder Express. When the legendary Swedish progg band Nationalteatern reunited in the 1990s Hellberg was brought on board as their new vocalist. He also performed live with the band's former vocalist Totta Näslund as a backup due to Näslund's health problems.

The term is more prevalent among Sephardi Jews, but it is also widely used by Ashkenazi Haredi Jews. It is an Aramaic word used frequently in the Talmud, which means 'our master' (, ', 'our master'). Most often, as the translation indicates, it is given to rabbis who are considered influential teachers and leaders. The most common use of the term is in reference to \\"Maran Beth Yosef\\", Yosef Karo. In fact, when used without further qualification, Maran usually refers to Karo. Amongst contemporary rabbis, Yosef Shalom Eliashiv and Ovadia Yosef are most closely associated with the honorific. In contemporary parlance Maran is often attributed to Rabbis who serve as founding heads of a particular ideological/cultural movement. This use is usually limited to communication within that particular movement. For example, within their respective communities Elazar Shach (Maran HaRav Shach) and Joel Teitelbaum often receive the title. As with most honorifics, this title precedes the name: for example, one might say \\"Maran Rabbi Ovadia Yosef\\". Similarly to honorifics like doctor, it can also be used for direct addressing by itself when there is no ambiguity. When used with a name, it will almost always be followed by the (technically redundant) \\"Rabbi\\", as in the above example.

It has three strings and is essentially a larger version of the double bass - the specimen in the collection of the Musée de la Musique in Paris measures in length, whereas a full-size double bass is generally approximately in length. Because of the extreme fingerboard length and string thickness, the musician plays it using a system of levers and pedals. The levers serve to engage metal clamps that are positioned above the neck at specific positions. These clamps act as fretting devices when the performer presses the levers. It has never been produced on a large scale or used much by composers (though Hector Berlioz wrote favorably about the instrument and proposed its widespread adoption). The only known work from the Nineteenth Century that specifically calls for the Octobass is Charles Gounod's Messe solennelle de Sainte-Cécile. In this work, the Octobass only appears in the \\"Benedictus\\" and the \\"Agnus Dei.\\" It typically plays one octave below the Double Bass. pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ac98/d88a6e3a4e6139df7ef1cdec0bd5f0eb135b.pdf The octobass of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. In addition to the Paris instrument, octobasses exist in the collections of the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, Arizona and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. In October 2016, the Quebec company Canimex donated an octobass to the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, which is now the only orchestra in the world to own one. This instrument was made by the luthier Jean-Jacques Pagès of Mirecourt, France in 2010.Canimex acquiert une octobasse pour l'OSM (in French) ==Range and tuning== According to Berlioz, the three open strings were tuned C1, G1, and C2. This tuning gave it a low range one octave below the cello and equal to the modern double bass with low C extension. However, at the time when the octobass was invented, the double bass lacked this extension and could descend only to E1 or G1. The mechanism enabled each string to chromatically cover the range of a perfect fifth and gave the instrument a high range to G2. The instrument at the Musée de la Musique in Paris, which uses period-accurate gut strings, is tuned thus (though on at least some recordings the overall tuning is a half-step flat). The playing range of the octobass, according to Berlioz. The instrument at the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, which uses modern wound metal strings, is tuned C0, G0, D1. This tuning gives it a low range two octaves below the cello and one octave below the modern double bass with low C extension. Berlioz specifically noted this tuning in his orchestration treatise, but considered it erroneous. As on the Paris instrument, the mechanism allows each string to cover a perfect fifth, giving it a high range to A1. The fundamental frequencies of the lowest notes in this tuning lie below 20 Hz -- the commonly-stated lower bound of human hearing range -- but these notes are nevertheless audible due to the overtones they produce. (An organ's 32′ stop also exceeds the supposed 20 Hz limit.) The playing range of the octobass owned by the Musical Instrument Museum in Phoenix, Arizona. The Montreal Symphony Orchestra octobass uses gut strings, is tuned A0, E1, B1 and has a high range to F2.

She is the only rhythmic gymnast who has competed in four Olympic finals. She became the first Spanish gymnast in history to have competed in two Olympic finals, Atlanta and Sydney, and she is the only rhythmic gymnast to make the finals at four consecutive Olympic Games: Atlanta 1996, Sydney 2000, Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008 She also won the gold medal in the XVth Mediterranean Games Almería 2005 and she has been awarded many other national and international recognitions; among others, the gold medal in the Royal Order of Sports Merit in 2009, which is a Spanish civil Order of Merit intended to recognise yearly activities in the fields of sport and physical education. In June 2001, the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique announced that Almudena's \\"body-apparatus relationship\\" with the ball was approved by the Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee. As the code describes the Cid Tostado element: > Starting position: on one knee, leg forward, ball held with the foot. large > roll of the ball on both legs. Originality 0.10 (§ 2.6.5.) After a career lasting 21 years, she retired from rhythmic gymnastics on 23 August 2008. Currently, she is working as a sports commentator for rhythmic gymnastics competitions. Since 2014, she has also been writing Olympia, a children’s collection of stories in which she talks about her sporting life. == Early life and training == 2003 European Championships She started practising rhythmic gymnastics at the age of 7. She first went to Arabatxo club and then to Beti Aurrera club in Vitoria, in which other important gymnasts such as Tania Lamarca and Estíbaliz Martínez were trained. Her coaches there were Aurora Fernández del Valle and Iratxe Aurrekoetxea. One of Almudena’s first sports references, as she named them because she doesn't like to call them idols, was the Russian gymnast Oxana Kostina. In May 1994, at the age of 13, she took part in the first international competition, in which she received three medals (one gold medal and two bronze medals). In November of the same year, she was asked by Emilia Boneva to start being part of the Spanish national individual team in Madrid, where she trained an average of 8 hours a day in the gym Gimnasio Moscardó. At the 1995 Spanish Individual Championships, Almudena took the lead at a national level for the first time. In June 1995 she got the 12th position at the Final European Cup in Telford (England). == Senior career == Since she started her sporting career, she has been awarded many recognitions, apart from the ones obtained at the Olympic Games. === 1996 === In 1996, she went to her first Olympic Games in Atlanta, where she participated for the individual team, along with her colleague Alba Caride. She achieved the fifth position in the preliminary round and the ninth position in the semi-final. Finally, she got the ninth position in the Olympics final, being the youngest participant in the competition. === 2000 === Due to her good marks at the European Championship in Zaragoza, she was selected in order to represent Spain at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Again she got the ninth position. In her home town, Vitoria, she met her former trainer Iratxe, who motivated Almudena’s sporting life. They both moved to Barcelona and started working again together. === 2004 === In 2004, the Spanish Gymnastics Federation decided that Almudena Cid and Jennifer Colino had to compete against each other in order to choose who would represent Spain at the 2004 Athens Olympics. The competition was at a very high level - nearly at Olympic level - causing mental and physical weariness and increasing the risk of injury before the Olympic Games. After obtaining the best marks, Almudena went to the 2004 Athens Olympics. Almudena's worldwide debut in Viena (1995) Almudena Cid and Jennifer Colino in a championship in Granada (2002) In these Games she reached her third olympic final, something that no other rhythmic gymnastic had gotten until then. In the final, that took place on 29 August, she got the eighth position, along with the Olympic diploma.

It coincided with the very last day of the Olympics finals in Beijing, in which she got the eighth position, along with the Olympic diploma. Her last exercise was with ribbon, accompanied by an adaptation of “Nessun dorma”, which is an aria by Giacomo Puccini. As a final gesture as a gymnast, she drew the shape of a heart on the mat and she kissed it. Some years later, Almudena explained in an interview about her retirement and legacy in the field of rhythmic gymnastics: > “It was hard to decide when to retire, but I chose the moment that I wanted > [...]. I’ve been trying for 8 years to avoid the idea that I was already too > old to practise this sport. At the age of 28, I managed to show the world > that I could be on top [...].

Because it is > the society that retires you from it.

It is the primary teaching hospital for Yale School of Medicine and Yale School of Nursing. The hospital is a Magnet hospital and is accredited by the Joint Commission. It is also a Level I trauma center for adult and pediatric patients. It operates a pediatric critical care transport team including registered nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians who transfer pediatric patients from smaller community hospitals to Yale New Haven Children's Hospital. In 2020, YNHH was ranked nationally in 9 of 16 specialties by U.S. News & World Report: Psychiatry (#10); Geriatrics (#20); Diabetes and Endocrinology (#31); Pulmonology (#31); Neurology and Neurosurgery (#32); Kidney Disorders (#35); Gastroenterology (#41); Ear, Nose and Throat (#48); and Orthopedics (#50).

YNHH is the second largest employer in New Haven, Connecticut, with 17,061 employees. ==History== New Haven Hospital, about 1911The history of Yale New Haven Hospital extends back to 1826 when the General Hospital Society of Connecticut was chartered as the first hospital in Connecticut and the fourth voluntary hospital in the nation. The hospital rented temporary quarters and raised US$5,000 toward the purchase of land and construction. A new 13-bed hospital opened in 1833 on seven and a half acres of land bordered by Cedar Street and Howard, Davenport, and Congress avenues. The original building, called the State Hospital, was designed by prominent New Haven architect Ithiel Town and cost US$13,000. In 1862, the State Hospital was converted to a military hospital to care for Union soldiers during the American Civil War. The hospital was renamed to the Knight United States Army General Hospital in honor of Jonathan Knight, the president of the board of trustees. Some attending physicians moved with the civilian patients to temporary quarters on Whitney Avenue. After the Civil War, the hospital was turned over to the General Society of Connecticut in 1865. The hospital converted back to its original name of State Hospital. The Connecticut Training School, the third training school for nurses in the United States, was opened by the hospital in 1873. In 1884, the hospital's name was changed to New Haven Hospital to reflect the name that was widely being used by the residents of New Haven. Yale School of Medicine and New Haven Hospital formalized their relationship in 1913. U.S. medical education, which had begun as a simple apprenticeship system, evolved to become a formal educational plan based on alliances between medical schools and hospitals. This was the start of what is now known as the Yale New Haven Medical Center. Their first motorized ambulance was purchased by New Haven Hospital in 1914. In 1945, the hospital changed its name to Grace-New Haven Hospital after it affiliated itself with nearby Grace Hospital. On July 6, 1946, U.S. President George W. Bush was born at the hospital. In 1951, the New Haven Dispensary formally merged with Grace-New Haven Hospital. The New Haven Dispensary had opened in 1871 as the city's first outpatient clinic. In 1965, a more formal agreement with the Yale School of Medicine resulted in another name change to Yale–New Haven Hospital. 1993 saw the opening of the Yale New Haven Children's Hospital becoming the first full-service children's hospital in Connecticut, including the first children's emergency department. The Yale New Haven Psychiatric Hospital was opened in 2000, after the purchase of the Yale Psychiatric Institute. In 2003, a scandal over the hospital's treatment of poor patients severely tarnished its image. In March 2003, The Wall Street Journal reported on the case of Quinton White, a retiree, whom the hospital had sued. It had seized his bank account and put a lien on his house because White was in arrears in paying off his late wife's cancer treatment. Subsequent reporting indicated that the hospital had a practice of aggressively suing poor patients despite its status as a tax-exempt charitable organization. Public protests ensued, and state attorney general Richard Blumenthal sued the hospital for keeping money that was intended to help poor patients. In response, the hospital forgave the debt of tens of thousands of patients, replaced its executives, and changed its billing practices. It also established community outreach programs that helped YNHH win the 2017 American Hospital Association's Foster G. McGaw Prize for Excellence in Community Service. On September 12, 2012, YNHH acquired the assets of the Hospital of Saint Raphael (HSR), making it a single hospital with two main campuses. ==Facilities== The main patient campus of Yale New Haven Hospital comprises four inpatient pavilions bounded by South Frontage Road, Park Street, Howard Avenue, and York Street. The East Pavilion, originally called the Memorial Unit, was opened in 1952 (designed by Douglas Orr). Originally 8 stories tall, it was expanded to ten floors in 1972. The South Pavilion was opened in 1982 and followed by the Yale New Haven Children's Hospital (West Pavilion) in 1993. In 2009, YNHH saw the opening of the Smilow Cancer Hospital (North Pavilion). All four pavilions are connected by a central atrium. In 2000, Yale New Haven Hospital acquired the nearby Yale Psychiatric Institute (designed by architect Frank Gehry in 1989) and opened Yale New Haven Psychiatric Hospital. In 2004, the Yale New Haven Shoreline Medical Center in Guilford, Connecticut, was opened. The New Haven Pavilion houses outpatient clinics, clinical laboratories, and administration, among other departments. Located across the street from the inpatient pavilions, it occupies land that the original hospital was built on in 1833. The New Haven Pavilion connects directly to facilities of the Yale School of Medicine. In 2012, Yale New Haven Hospital acquired the assets of Hospital of Saint Raphael, located on Chapel Street in New Haven, which established Yale New Haven Hospital Saint Raphael Campus. ===Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven=== In October 2009, Yale New Haven Hospital opened the 14-story Smilow Cancer Hospital at Yale New Haven. Smilow Cancer Hospital is affiliated with Yale Cancer Center, southern New England's only designated Comprehensive Cancer Center and one of 41 such centers in the United States. Smilow Cancer Hospital integrates all oncology patient services at the Hospital and Yale School of Medicine in one building specifically designed for the delivery of cancer care. While construction was scheduled to begin in September 2005, the project was delayed by disputes with unions and the city. On March 22, 2006, the unions and the hospital reached an agreement. Construction on the new Yale–New Haven Cancer Hospital started on May 18, 2006, with the demolition of the Grace Building and site preparation. Groundbreaking occurred on Wednesday, September 6, 2006. The Cancer Center building was named Smilow Cancer Hospital in honor of Joel E. and Joan Smilow's large gift to the cancer hospital. Joel E. Smilow is an alumnus of Yale University class of '54 and the former chair, chief executive officer, and president of Playtex Products Inc. Smilow Cancer Hospital is connected to the other facilities via the atrium. The project includes an adjacent six- story building at 55 Park Street. The building was designed by Barry Svigals of Svigals + Partners and Behnisch Architekten. The 55 Park building houses a large atrium connecting the main parking garage with the Smilow Cancer Hospital as well as clinical laboratories, the main hospital pharmacy, and other support functions for the hospital. The City of New Haven approved 55 Park on November 15, 2007. ==See also== *List of former United States Army medical units *List of the oldest hospitals in the United States ==ReferencesExternal links== * *The Archives at Yale New Haven Hospital *Yale-New Haven Hospital records, Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University *New Haven Hospital and Grace-New Haven Community Hospital Collection, Medical Historical Library, Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library, Yale University Category:1826 establishments in Connecticut Category:Teaching hospitals in Connecticut Category:Economy of New Haven, Connecticut Category:Closed medical facilities of the United States Army Category:Buildings and structures in New Haven, Connecticut Category:Hospitals established in 1826 Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1952 Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1982 Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1993 Category:Voluntary hospitals ","title":"Yale New Haven Hospital"},{"id":"2204838","text":"Morya is one of the \\"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\\" within modern Theosophical beliefs. He is one of the Mahatmas who inspired the founding of the Theosophical Society and was engaged in a correspondence with two English Theosophists living in India, A. P. Sinnett and A. O. Hume. The correspondence was published in 1923 by A. Trevor Barker, in the book The Mahatma Letters to A. P. Sinnett. ==History== A portrait of Master Morya by Hermann Schmiechen H. P. Blavatsky, originally described the existence of a spiritual master whom she considered her guru, and who went by, among other names, Morya. Blavatsky said that Morya and another master, Koot Hoomi, were her primary guides in establishing the Theosophical Society. Blavatsky also wrote that Masters Morya and Koot Hoomi belonged to a group of highly developed humans known to some as the Great White Brotherhood or the White Lodge (though this is not how they described themselves). Master Morya's personality has been depicted in some detail by various theosophical authors. A man \\"living on the earth, but possessed of developed senses that laughed at time and space.\\" On the other hand, author P. Jenkins challenges that there is little evidence that Blavatsky's Masters, including Morya, ever existed.Philip Jenkins, Mystics and Messiahs, p.41-42. Oxford University Press, 2000, NYC Author K. Paul Johnson wrote that Blavatsky gave conflicting versions of her meeting with Morya and suggests Blavatsky fictionalized the story, basing it on her encounter with an Italian political activist.K. Paul Johnson, The Masters Revealed: Madame Blavatsky and the Myth of the Great White Lodge (Albany: SUNY, 1994), 41.Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press Blavatsky's published works have been praised by New York papers as exhibiting immense research, in referring to her book Isis Unveiled the New York Sun writes, \\"the strange part of this is, as I and many others can testify as eye witnesses to the production of the book, that the writer had no library in which to make researches and possessed no notes of investigation or reading previously done. All was written straight out of hand. And yet it is full of references to books in the British Museum and other great libraries, and every reference is correct. Either, then, we have, as to that book [referring to Isis Unveiled], a woman who was capable of storing in her memory a mass of facts, dates, numbers, titles, and subjects such as no other human being ever was capable of, or her claim to help from unseen beings is just.\\" After Blavatsky's death, theosophists and others continued claiming to have met Morya or to have received communications from him. William Quan Judge, the leader of the American Section of the Theosophical Society, stated privately that he had received letters from Morya and other Adepts. Annie Besant, head of the European Section and co-head of the Esoteric Section with Judge, made public statements supporting the genuineness of those letters; but she later accused Judge of falsifying them, asserting that her suspicions of him were confirmed by the visitation of a Mahatma, presumably Master Morya, to whom she was linked.Annie Besant, The Case Against W. Q. Judge (1895), p. 13. About Besant’s closeness to Morya, in a letter of 27 March 1891 to Judge, Blavatsky writes: “She is not psychic nor spiritual in the least—all intellect—and yet she hears the Master's voice when alone, sees His Light, and recognises His Voice from that of D____.” The ensuing controversy led to the break-up of the Society in 1895, but leaders in the increasingly fragmented movement continued making claims about having received communications and visitations from the Masters connected with the cause. Theosophical writings offered vivid descriptions of Morya, his role in the Brotherhood, and his past lives.Letters of the Masters of the Wisdom: Second Series Nos. 69 and 70; First Series No. 19; Wachtmeister, op. cit., Chapter 5. ==Incarnations== Morya's earliest notable claimed incarnation is recorded by Annie Besant and C.W. Leadbeater (from, the source states, their research into the \\"akashic records\\" at the Theosophical Society headquarters in Adyar (Tamil Nadu), India conducted in the summer of 1910) as having been the Emperor of Atlantis in 220,000 BC, ruling from his palace in the capital city, the City of the Golden Gates.Besant, Annie and Leadbeater, C.W. Man: How, Whence, and Whither? Adyar, India:1913 Theosophical Publishing House Page 122 Note: On page xii of the introduction it is explained that the name Mars is used to refer to the reincarnating soul entity now known to Theosophists as Morya in his various incarnations. According to the Ascended Masters teachings, some of the later incarnations that Morya is said to have had include:Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare Lords of the Seven Rays Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - \\"Morya - Master of the First Ray\\" pages 21 - 78Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) The Masters and Their Retreats Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 87-92 El Morya Recent incarnation being with Osho along with K.H(Devaraj) *Melchior (one of the three wise men—the one who gave myrrh to Jesus) *Abraham *King Arthur of Camelot *Thomas Becket (Archbishop of Canterbury) *Thomas More *Akbar (Mogul Emperor) *Shams Tabrizi *Thomas Moore *Sergius of Radonezh ==Ascension== Students of Ascended Master Activities believe that Morya ascended in 1898, becoming an Ascended Master and Chohan of the First Ray, and that his spiritual retreat is located at Darjeeling, India.Luk, A.D.K..

Moser was dominant from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s and won the 1984 Giro d'Italia, the 1977 world road racing championship and six times in three of the five monuments. He turned professional in 1973, showing a cultured pedaling style. But his powerful build meant he was not a gifted climber. His 273 road victories puts him behind Eddy Merckx (525) and Rik Van Looy (379), but ahead of Rik Van Steenbergen (270) and Roger De Vlaeminck (255). He was also an accomplished track rider, riding up to six Six-Day races almost each winter throughout his career. He rode 35, 14 of which with René Pijnen, winning 15. A nephew, Moreno Moser, (born 25 December 1990) is an Italian professional racer, and Francesco's son Ignazio Moser enjoyed success at the junior and amateur levels before retiring at the age of 22. ==PalmarèsClassic races=== After finishing second in 1974 behind Roger De Vlaeminck and in 1976 behind Marc Demeyer of Belgium, Moser finally won Paris–Roubaix, his favorite race, three consecutive times. Moser had seven podium finishes in Paris–Roubaix; only De Vlaeminck, with nine, has more. In 1978, he beat De Vlaeminck and Jan Raas of the Netherlands; in 1979, he beat De Vlaeminck and Hennie Kuiper of the Netherlands; and in 1980, he beat Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle of France and the German, Dietrich Thurau. Moser came in third in 1981 behind Bernard Hinault and Roger De Vlaeminck, and was also third in 1983 behind Hennie Kuiper and Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle. He rode Paris–Roubaix in his final season as a cyclist in 1987. Other victories include the 1975 and 1978 Giro di Lombardia and the 1984 Milan–San Remo. ===Other classics=== Moser won the 1974 Paris–Tours, the 1977 Züri-Metzgete, the 1979 Gent–Wevelgem, and the 1977 Flèche Wallonne. ===Grand Tours=== Moser had some success in the three-week grand tours. He rode the Tour de France in 1975, and although he won two stages, led the race for seven days and won the young rider competition, he never rode the Tour again; the mountains did not suit him. However, he won the 1984 Giro d'Italia, in front of Laurent Fignon of France and Moreno Argentin of Italy. Taking advantage of an unusually flat course, Moser used time- trialing ability to overcome what others had gained in the mountains. He also won the points classification in the Giro d'Italia in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1982. ==Other accomplishments== He competed in the individual road race and team time trial events at the 1972 Summer Olympics. Moser won the 1977 world road racing championship in San Cristobal, Venezuela, in front of Thurau and Franco Bitossi. Moser was also silver medallist in 1976, behind Freddy Maertens of Belgium and second in 1978 to Gerrie Knetemann of the Netherlands. On 19 January 1984, in Mexico City, Moser broke the 1972 hour record of Eddy Merckx. He rode 50.808 kilometers, on an aerodynamic bike with full disc wheels more advanced than the conventional bike Merckx used in 1972. As a result, in 1997 the Union Cycliste Internationale banned hour records set on bikes featuring technological advantages. Under the new rules, Merckx's record wasn't broken until 2000. Moser auctioned his bicycle to benefit UNICEF. He was a member of the Regional Council of Trentino-Alto Adige from 1993 until 1998.https://www.consiglio.provincia.tn.it/istituzione/storia-del- consiglio/le-legislature/Pages/undicesima-1993-1998.aspx ==Rivalries== Moser's biggest rival was Giuseppe Saronni. ==After retirement== Moser started a bike company, Moser Cicli, constructing race bikes in a workshop in Trento. Production is 2,000-3,000 frames annually. He was the first chairman of the CPA (Cyclistes Professionels Associés), a union for professional riders of TT/I and TT/II league of teams (now UCI WorldTeams and UCI Professional Continental Teams, respectively). He held the position from 1999 until 2007. Moser also became a viticulturist, cultivating different varieties of grapes. He continued his father's winery with his children Francesca, Carlo and Ignazio on the family estate Maso Villa Warth in Val di Cembra, on the hills just north of Trento.

Casagrande was a professional cyclist between 1992 and 2005. ==Biography== He was a proven performer in the Grand Tours and the major one-day races. He wore the leader's jersey into the penultimate stage of the 2000 Giro d'Italia, but faltered badly and wound up 2nd to fellow Italian Stefano Garzelli. Casagrande did, however, win the mountains classification, wearing the corresponding green jersey on the podium. In major one-day races, he has won the Clásica de San Sebastián in 1998 and 1999, followed by the 2000 editions of the La Flèche Wallonne and Subida a Urkiola. Also in 1999, he placed 4th in the World Cycling Championships Road Race behind Óscar Freire, Markus Zberg, and Jean-Cyril Robin. In his early career, Casagrande won the 1996 Tirreno–Adriatico and Tour of the Basque Country -- both one-week stage races. In 1998, Casagrande tested positive for doping with testosterone during the Tour de Romandie, and consequently was fired by his team .Cofidis bids farewell, CNN, 1998 He was originally given a six-month sentence, later extended to nine months by the UCI. He returned to racing at the 1999 Tour de Suisse, a race that he won, taking the leader's jersey away from Laurent Jalabert on stage 9. Casagrande also scored victories at the 2001 and 2002 Giro del Trentino and the 2002 Settimana Ciclistica Internazionale Coppi-Bartali. In the 2002 Giro d'Italia, Casagrande was expelled from the race, after knocking down another cyclist.Giro gets downright weird: Casagrande sent packing, Velonews, 2002 In 2003, Casagrande won two mountain stages in the Tour de Suisse, but lost the leader's jersey in the penultimate day's time trial to Alexander Vinokourov. He was unable to start the last stage due to urethritis. Casagrande was barred from competing in the 2004 Vuelta a España a day before its start due to a high hematocrit level, indicating the use of erythropoietin (EPO), a popular doping product. In 2005, Casagrande retired.Casagrande stops, Cyclingnews, 2005 ==Major results== ;1994 :1st Tour of Tuscany :1st Tour of Emilia :1st Milano–Torino ;1995 :1st Tour of the Apennines ;1996 :1st 20px Overall Tirreno–Adriatico :1st 20px Overall Tour of the Basque Country ;1998 :1st Clásica de San Sebastián ;1999 :1st Clásica de San Sebastián :1st 20px Overall Tour de Suisse ;2000 :1st Giro del Trentino ;2001 :1st Giro del Trentino :1st Coppa Agostoni ;2003 :1st Coppa Agostoni :1st 20px Overall Tour de Suisse ** 2 stage wins === Major wins === * Giro d'Italia ** 1 stage win ** Winner mountains classification ** Leading the general classification for 12 days === Runner-up === * Giro d'Italia (2000) * Giro di Lombardia (2000) * Clásica de San Sebastián (2001) * Giro del Lazio (1999) * HEW Cyclassics (2000) * Giro del Veneto (1999, 2000) * Tour of Emilia (2001, 2004) ===Grand Tour general classification results timeline=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\"  Grand Tour ! scope=\\"col\\"  1993 ! scope=\\"col\\"  1994 ! scope=\\"col\\"  1995 ! scope=\\"col\\"  1996 ! scope=\\"col\\"  1997 ! scope=\\"col\\"  1998 ! scope=\\"col\\"  1999 ! scope=\\"col\\"  2000 ! scope=\\"col\\"  2001 ! scope=\\"col\\"  2002 ! scope=\\"col\\"  2003 ! scope=\\"col\\"  2004 - style=\\"text- align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  alt=A pink jersey Giro d'Italia  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"40  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"22  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#ddf;\\"10  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"31 — — —  style=\\"text- align:center; background:#ddf;\\"2  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"DNF  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"DSQ  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"DNF — - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  alt=A yellow jersey Tour de France — — — —  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#ddf;\\"6  style=\\"text- align:center;\\"DNF — —  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"DNF — — — - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  alt=A red jersey Vuelta a España — — — — — — — — —  style=\\"text-align:center; background:#ddf;\\"7 —  style=\\"text-align:center;\\"DNS } {  + Legend - ! scope=\\"row\\"  —  Did not compete - ! scope=\\"row\\"  DNF  Did not finish - ! scope=\\"row\\"  DSQ  Disqualified } ==See also== *List of doping cases in cycling *List of sportspeople sanctioned for doping offences ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1970 births Category:Sportspeople from Florence Category:Living people Category:Italian male cyclists Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic cyclists of Italy Category:Italian Giro d'Italia stage winners Category:Doping cases in cycling Category:Tour de Suisse stage winners Category:Vuelta a España cyclists Category:Tour de France cyclists Category:Giro d'Italia cyclists Category:UCI Road World Rankings winners ","title":"Francesco Casagrande"},{"id":"2204857","text":"Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, or AACF, is a non-profit advocacy organization which encourages public policy in Arkansas that will benefit children and their families. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families was founded in 1977 by attorney Hillary RodhamCimons, Marlene. \\"Shifting Toward a Mainstream Approach to Children's Issues\\". Los Angeles Times. December 24, 1992. p. 5. as a non-partisan 501(c)(3) group, and continues to be supported by a wide variety of individuals and organizations. == Policy positions and advocacy== In 1992, Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker wanted to end its policy of increasing Aid to Families with Dependent Children payments for additional children born into families on welfare.Duffy, Joan I. \\"Tucker Plan Halts AFDC to Subsequent Children\\". The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee). December 3, 1992. Governor Tucker said that the proposed policy would encourage women on welfare to use state-provided birth control rather than conceive, and it would save the state of Arkansas one-million dollars per year. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families opposed the governor's proposed policy, saying it would punish children and their mothers. In 1994, Governor Tucker proposed expanding the number of crimes for which 14- and 15-year-olds could be tried as adults.Duffy, Joan I. \\"Tucker plan on juvenile crime lauded, questioned\\". The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee). August 12, 1994. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families opposed the proposed policy, saying it would do nothing beneficial, and it would send more juveniles into the overburdened adult judicial system. The Arkansas House of Representatives debated a bill that would allow police officers to stop, arrest, and interrogate children without notifying their parents in 1994.Duffy, Joan I. \\"Ark. panel OK's bill letting cops question kids\\". The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee). August 17, 1994. Prosecutors were in favor of the bill, saying it was necessary for police at crime scenes to question children who might be witnesses or suspects. The Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families said the bill was clearly unconstitutional because minors lack the legal understanding to waive their constitutional rights without consulting an adult adviser such as their parents. In 1997, Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families advocated for increasing the number of eligible children participating in the summer lunch program.\\"Ark. Group Wants to Beef Up Lunch Line\\". Associated Press. The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee). July 11, 1997. The group said that just six percent of eligible children participate in the summer lunch program, a rate much lower than any other state. A state agency said the low rate was a result of children having no transportation to serving locations as well as a new state law that students who failed classes were no longer required to attend summer school. In 1998, Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families advocated for increased availability to child care, saying that families with two parents working needed additional help from the state with childcare so the parents can work.\\"Tenn., Ark., Miss. Fall Short on Kids' Care, Survey Finds\\". Associated Press. The Commercial Appeal (Memphis, Tennessee). May 6, 1998. Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families described Arkansas state income taxes as too high in 2000.\\"Study: Taxes unfair to poor\\". Times Record (Fort Smith, Arkansas). May 11, 2000. The group said that Arkansas state income tax was regressive and put too large a burden on families with lower incomes. The group advocated for a zero-percent income tax rate for families with low incomes, refundable earned income tax credit for low-income families, and elimination of the state sales tax on groceries. ==External links== * ==Notes== Category:1977 establishments in Arkansas Category:Non-profit organizations based in Arkansas Category:Children's rights organizations in the United States Category:Hillary Clinton ","title":"Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families"},{"id":"2204859","text":"Josiah Oliver Wolcott (October 31, 1877 – November 11, 1938) was an American lawyer, politician and judge, from Dover, in Kent County, Delaware. He was a member of the Democratic Party, who served as Attorney General of Delaware, U.S. Senator from Delaware, and Chancellor of Delaware. ==Early life and family== Wolcott was born in Dover, Delaware, attended the Wilmington Conference Academy, now Wesley College, at Dover, and graduated from Wesleyan University, Middletown, Connecticut. He was admitted to the Delaware Bar in 1904 and began the practice of law at Wilmington, Delaware. ==Professional and political career== Wolcott was Deputy Delaware Attorney General from 1909 until 1913, elected Delaware Attorney General in 1912 and served from January 21, 1913, until January 16, 1917. In the first popular election of a U.S. Senator in Delaware, he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1916, defeating incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Henry A. du Pont. During this term, Wolcott served with the Democratic majority in the 65th Congress, but was in the minority in the 66th and 67th Congress. In the 65th Congress he was Chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Commerce. Between 1918 and 1919, he served on the Overman Committee, investigating seditious German and Bolshevik activities. In all, he served from March 4, 1917 to July 2, 1921, during the administrations of U.S. Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Warren G. Harding. Wolcott was the senate sponsor of legislation to create a federal charter for the American Legion. The House co-sponsor was Rep. Royal Johnson of South Dakota. The bill was filed on June 27, 1919, passed the House on August 27, passed the Senate on September 5 and was signed by President Wilson on September 16, 1919. (A History of the American Legion Marquis James. 1923. Pg. 71.) On July 2, 1921, Wolcott resigned from the U.S. Senate to accept a surprising appointment from Republican Governor William D. Denney to become Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery. The appointment came to be known as the \\"deal\\" or the \\"dirty deal,\\" and many suspected T. Coleman du Pont organized it in order to gain the U.S. Senate seat for himself and the Republican Party. Wolcott served as Chancellor for the remainder of his life. ==Death and legacy== Wolcott died at Dover and is buried there in the Lakeside Methodist Episcopal Cemetery. According to Henry R. Horsey and William Duffy in their article on the Delaware Court system, Wolcott distinguished himself as Chancellor and they continued: Chancellery \\"Judge Pearson later recalled the spartan 'office' of Chancellor Wolcott, consisting of a small desk and gooseneck lamp, in the stacks of the State Law Library in Dover. There Wolcott worked without a secretary, writing his opinions in longhand. Pearson attributed Wolcott's conduct to his determination to ask for nothing. It was during Wolcott's tenure that Delaware's Court of Chancery gained the high regard and respect of lawyers and corporate boards throughout the country. It was Wolcott's judicial wisdom and judgment that first attracted lawyers and litigants from around the nation to Delaware as a preferred forum for litigation.\\" Every year, five students in their final year at Delaware Law School earn the Josiah Oliver Wolcott Fellowship. Wolcott fellows work as judicial law clerks for the Supreme Court of Delaware. ==Almanac== Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1.

It includes the delta of the Mahanadi River, Brahmani River, Baitarani River. The most prominent physiographic feature of this plain is the Chilka Lake. It is the biggest lake in the country and its area varies between 780 sq km in winter to 1,144 sq km in the monsoon months. Utkal Plains, coastal plains in eastern Orissa state, eastern India. Extending over about 16,000 square miles (41,400 square km), the plains are bounded by the Lower Ganges (Ganga) Plain to the north, the Bay of Bengal to the east, the Tamilnad Plains to the south, and the Eastern Ghats to the west. The Utkal Plains are coastal lowlands consisting chiefly of Mahanadi delta deposits and marine sediments, and they merge with the Eastern Ghats at an elevation of about 250 feet (76 metres). The plains have a nearly straight shoreline. Paleogene and Neogene alluvium (from about 65 to 2.6 million years ago) with patches of ancient Archean gneiss and sandstone (from about 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago), the plains are widest in the deltaic regions. Sand dunes of decomposed granites and zircon, created mainly by the action of wind at low tide, and lagoons are found along the Bay of Bengal. Chilka, the largest lake in the region (in the southwest), is salty; Samang and Sur (north and northeast of Puri, respectively) are freshwater lakes. Littoral forests are found along the coast of the Cuttack and Balasore areas, and tropical moist deciduous forests are found inland throughout the regions near Puri and Cuttack. The Mahanadi, Brahmani, Baitarani, and Subarnarekha rivers are often subject to heavy flooding; the combined outflow of these rivers has formed the Mahanadi delta in the northern part of the plains. The region has fertile red and black soils. Agriculture is the main occupation, and rice is the principal crop; pulses (legumes) and oilseeds are also grown. Major irrigation projects located in the plains permit double- cropping. Industry, centred in Cuttack, Bhubaneshwar, and Puri along the Kolkata-Chennai (Calcutta-Madras) railway, includes paper mills, refrigerator plants, and the production of ceramics, glass, refractories, textiles, and galvanized pipe. The plains have a network of roads and railways, inland waterways in Cuttack, and an airfield at Bhubaneshwar. Buddhism flourished in the Utkal Plains in the 3rd century ce under the Mauryan emperor Ashoka, and the region is described in the rock edicts of Dhauli as forming part of the ancient Kalinga territory. Successive ancient dynasties including the Satavahanas, Karas, and Eastern Gangas ruled the region until, in the latter half of the 16th century, it passed to the Muslims and later to the Marathas. The British assumed control of the plains in 1804. ==References== Category:Plains of India Category:Landforms of Odisha ","title":"Utkal Plains"},{"id":"2204862","text":"The viscosity index (VI) is an arbitrary, unit-less measure of a fluid's change in viscosity relative to temperature change. It is mostly used to characterize the viscosity-temperature behavior of lubricating oils. The lower the VI, the more the viscosity is affected by changes in temperature. The higher the VI, the more stable the viscosity remains over temperature fluctuations. The VI was originally measured on a scale from 0 to 100; however, advancements in lubrication science have led to the development of oils with much higher VIs. The viscosity of a lubricant is closely related to its ability to reduce friction in solid body contacts. Generally, the least viscous lubricant which still forces the two moving surfaces apart to achieve \\"fluid bearing\\" conditions is desired. If the lubricant is too viscous, it will require a large amount of energy to move (as in honey); if it is too thin, the surfaces will come in contact and friction will increase. == Relevance == Many lubricant applications require the lubricant to perform across a wide range of conditions, for example, automotive lubricants are required to reduce friction between engine components when the engine is started from cold (relative to the engine's operating temperatures) up to when it is running. The best oils with the highest VI will remain stable and not vary much in viscosity over the temperature range. This allows for consistent engine performance within the normal working conditions. Historically, there were two different oil types recommended for usage in different weather conditions. As an example, with winter oils and cold starting the engines, and with temperature ranges from, say, -30*C to 0*C, a 5 weight oil would be pumpable at the very low temperatures and the generally cooler engine operating temperatures. However, in hot climates where temperatures range from 30*C to 45*C, a 50 weight oil would be necessary so it would remain thick enough to hold up an oil film between the moving hot parts. Thus the issue of multigrade oils came into being, where with variable temperatures of, say, minus -10*C during the cold nights and 20*C during the days, a 5 weight oil would be good as the oil would be pumpable in a cold engine and as the engine came up to running temperature, and the day warmed up, the characteristics of a 30 weight oil would be ideal. Thus the 5W-30W or 5-30W oils were introduced, rather than the fixed and temperature limiting grades — where the thin oils became too thin when hot and the thicker oils became too thick when cold. This effects of temperature on a single viscosity oil can be demonstrated by pouring a small amount of vegetable oil into a pot or pan and then either cooling it in a freezer or heating it on a cooking stove. When oils get cold enough in a deep freezer, they will solidify into a block of \\"wax\\" like oil that cannot be pumped around inside an engine's lubrication system. However when a spoonful of very cold oil is put into a pan on a stove and it is slowly heated and swirled around, the oil will gradually warm up, and there is a definite temperature range where the oil is warm and very \\"oily\\" or quite lubricating. However as the oil is heated further, the oil becomes thinner and thinner until it is nearly smoking and it is almost as thin as water — and thus it has almost no capacity to keep moving parts separated — resulting in metal to metal contact and damage of the components that are supposed to be kept apart with a thin film of oil. Thus the multigrade oils are recommended for use based on the ambient temperature ranges of the season or environment. Additionally, there are the issues of oil temperature maintenance, such as oil or engine heaters that enable easy starting and shorter warm up period in very cold climates, and oil coolers to dump enough heat from the oil, and thus the engine, gearbox, or hydraulic oil circuit, so as to keep the oil's upper temperature to within a specified upper working limit. It is wise to follow the manufacturers recommendation as to what grades of oil or types of lubricants should be used in or on any equipment relative to the seasonal temperature ranges of the environment that the equipment is used in. Despite all the neurosis generating literature of the advertising industry, a fairly simple oil viscosity and temperature chart does fulfill the educational needs of the user and the enquipment, the latter being reasonably typical of all owner manuals and combustion engine manufacturers. As stipulated earlier, always follow the specifications of your equipment manufacturer. == Classification == The VI scale was set up by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). The temperatures chosen arbitrarily for reference are . The scale was originally interpolated between 0 for a naphthenic Texas Gulf crude and 100 for a paraffinnic Pennsylvania crude. Since the inception of the scale better oils have also been produced, leading to VIs greater than 100 (see below). VI improving additives and higher quality base oils are widely used nowadays which increase the VIs attainable beyond the value of 100. The Viscosity Index of synthetic oils ranges from 80 to over 400. :{  - !Viscosity index !!Classification - Under 35 Low - 35 to 80 Medium - 80 to 110 High - Above 110 Very high } == Calculation == The viscosity index can be calculated using the following formula: :\\\\mathrm{VI }= 100 \\\\frac{L-U}{L-H} where U is the oil's kinematic viscosity at , and L and H are values based on the oil's kinematic viscosity at . L and H are the values of viscosity at 40°C for oils of VI 0 and 100 respectively, having the same viscosity at 100°C as the oil whose VI we are trying to determine. These L and H values can be found in ASTM D2270. ==References== https://xenum.com/en/engine-oil-viscosity-index/ https://www.lubricants.total.com/what-motor-oil-vi Category:Lubricants Category:Oil additives Category:Tribology ","title":"Viscosity index"},{"id":"2204869","text":"Arkansas Children's Hospital (ACH) is a pediatric hospital with a Level I trauma center in Little Rock, Arkansas.

In 2013, Arkansas Children's Hospital successfully treated 12-year-old Kali Hardig for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. Her case became national news because she is one of only two known survivors of this disease, which she contracted after swimming in a warm-water lake park. Physicians at Arkansas Children's Hospital credit Kali's mother Traci with acting swiftly to get her child to the Emergency Department, saving her life. A team of laboratory staff, infectious disease physicians, critical care specialists and rehabilitation medicine experts worked with Kali for weeks to help her overcome the devastating illness. Anti-fungal medications and antibiotics were used. Physicians also contacted the CDC to get permission to use an experimental anti-amoeba drug that had to be shipped from the Atlanta headquarters. Arkansas Department of Health officials said 99 percent of people who contract the naegleria fowleri parasite die. Kali spent 22 days in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at ACH, followed by several weeks on the hospital's rehabilitation floor before going home. In 2007 ACH treated the case of 20-month-old Jacob Esses, which spurred the recall of the Aqua Dots toy. After swallowing a number of the toy beads, 1,4-Butanediol coating the beads was metabolized to Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB, a recreational anesthetic). The drug has been shown to cause unconsciousness, drowsiness, seizures, coma, or death.US Drug Enforcement Administration ACH has been profiled a number of times on the Discovery Health Channel. In the fall of 2007, the program “Surgery Saved My Life” examined how three physicians in the Arkansas Children's Hospital Vascular Anomalies Center of Excellence handled patients’ potentially fatal vascular tumors.

He is a constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who works in the American city of Chicago, Illinois as Deputy Liaison Officer in the Canadian consulate. He lives in a dangerous neighbourhood at the fictional address of apartment 3J at 221 East Racine, and later at the consulate itself, after his apartment building was burnt down. The character is portrayed by Canadian actor Paul Gross. Fraser's seemingly strange habits, such as tasting evidence and holding the door for anyone and everyone, add hilarity and whimsy to the show. As Fraser often explains; \\"I first came to Chicago on the trail of the killers of my father, and for reasons that don't need exploring at this juncture I have remained, attached as liaison with the Canadian Consulate.\\" Fraser is a strait-laced Canadian, and his faith in the honour and goodness of others tends to lead to interesting and humorous moments. Described as an \\"outdoors Sherlock Holmes\\", his behaviour often leads to the frustration of his de facto partner, Chicago detective Raymond Vecchio, played by David Marciano. His other \\"best friend,\\" a deaf half-wolf, Diefenbaker, named after the Canadian Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker, reads lips in both English and Inuktitut, and often assists in the capture of criminals. In the third and fourth seasons of the show, Fraser teamed up with Detective Stanley Raymond Kowalski, after Ray Vecchio went undercover in the Las Vegas Mafia. He is usually called \\"Fraser\\" by his friends and colleagues - some old friends will call him Benton or Ben at times. Ray calls him Benny or Fraser, (often mispronouncing it \\"Fray-sure\\" as in the NBC sitcom Frasier). ==Character== Benton Fraser was conceived in an igloo, (according to his father), and was born out in a field, and grew up in Inuvik, Northwest Territories; and Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories. After his mother was killed when he was still young, Benton was raised by his paternal grandparents, who were traveling librarians. His mother, Caroline, was killed when he was an 8-year- old boy, and his father, Bob Fraser, (played by Canadian actor Gordon Pinsent), was murdered in the pilot episode, at this point, Benton had been with the RCMP for 13 years. Bob, or \\"Fraser Sr.,\\" as he is sometimes known, was a legendarily effective officer in the RCMP and often appears to his son as a ghost throughout the series to offer help and advice. Other relatives include an Uncle Tiberius, (who died wrapped in Cabbage leaves, which the family assumes to have been a freak accident, first mentioned in \\"The Gift of the Wheelman\\" in season 1,) and an Aunt Winnie, (mentioned only in \\"Perfect Strangers\\", in season 3). According to best friend, Ray Vecchio, in An Eye for a Eye, Benton's problem is that \\"if [he] sees a problem, [he's] gotta fix it, [he] can't even go to the mens room without stopping to tell some simple, stupid, charmingly-witty Inuit story, that inspires people to take on the world's social ills.\\" In \\"The Blue Line\\", in season 1, it is revealed that Benton is a fan of Ice hockey, and that he used to play it as a child; and in \\"Asylum\\", in season 3, it is shown that Benton is also a fan of curling. Fraser has had an unfortunate recurring relationship with Victoria Metcalf, a bank robber with whom he became infatuated after pursuing her into and then helping her survive a lengthy winter storm. After the storm was over, Fraser turned Victoria in to the authorities and she was sent to prison. This encounter is first outlined in episode 14 of series 1, \\"You must remember this\\"; during a stake-out Fraser comes the closest to 'baring his soul' before turning to find Vecchio asleep. That episode fades with Fraser looking at a slightly crumpled black-and-white photo of her. She later resurfaced in Chicago, blackmailing Fraser into helping her use the money from the bank robbery to buy jewels on the black market, threatening to have Ray Vecchio framed for corruption. She left Chicago soon after her plot unraveled, and was not seen again. Having little experience with romantic matters, Fraser appears to have suppressed his emotions, often for comic effect in the series, and buried himself in the masculine pursuits of law enforcement and campcraft. His super-human detective abilities provide humorous contrast with his inability to interact with women. His fixation upon the criminal Metcalf, and later, his superior officer, Margaret Thatcher, (no relation to the British prime minister), was unreasonable, and he may have used his attraction to an unavailable woman as a mechanism for avoiding change in his own life. In the ITV documentary South Bound co-star David Marciano said it was vital that the character of Fraser be both innocent but also unemotional. Actor Daniel Kash, (Detective Louis Gardino in the series), in the same documentary observed about Fraser that 'You'll never see that character cry. You'll sense that he'll be crying inside but you'll never see tears going down his face. He's just too buffed for that, and too reserved.' In the episode Bounty Hunter, Fraser meets a woman who seems very compatible with him, but his father warns Benton off. Fraser Sr tries to get his son to understand that the woman is not the one who is vulnerable, but Benton. For all of his son's physical self- reliance, the young constable needs emotional maturing. Fraser eventually discovered he had a half-sister, Maggie MacKenzie, in the season four episode Hunting Season. Because Bob Fraser is her father, she can also see his ghost. Just like her father and half-brother, Maggie is a member of the RCMP. She arrived in Chicago pursuing the killers of her husband, under circumstances similar to Fraser's own arrival in the city, though she soon returned to Canada, unlike Fraser, who remained in Chicago for some time. Fraser wears his uniform stetson hat both in uniform and out. When he loses it, he seems to get into trouble. Fans of the show have thus nicknamed it the Stetson of Invulnerability. Fraser carries his paper money inside his hat. He frequently only has Canadian currency with him as it is \\"regulation\\" to be paid in that currency. Fraser's apartment is at 221 East Racine. The neighbourhood is dangerous, but Fraser liked the apartment for its close proximity to his workplace. ==Series finale== Fraser would eventually return to Canada and, along with Stanley Kowalski, set out on an adventure to find the hand of Sir John Franklin, an explorer who disappeared while trying to discover the Northwest Passage. (The soundtrack for that segment was Stan Rogers's song \\"Northwest Passage\\".) As the series ended with the beginning of their expedition, it is unknown what has happened to Fraser or Kowalski since then. His closing remarks: \\"If we find it...we'll let you know.\\" The ITV documentary, made nine years after the series ended, concludes with Paul Gross saying \\"We never did photograph it, but I can tell you that we, (Benton and Stanley,) found it.\\" ==ReferencesExternal links== * Benton Fraser at TV IV Category:Television characters introduced in 1994 Category:Fictional immigrants to the United States Category:Due South characters Category:Fictional police constables Category:Fictional Canadian people Category:Fictional characters from the Northwest Territories Category:Fictional Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers ","title":"Benton Fraser"},{"id":"2204874","text":"Teleperformance SE is an omnichannel company headquartered in France.

He is remembered for an eloquent letter he wrote to his wife Sarah, one week before he was killed in the First Battle of Bull Run. ==Early life== Ballou was born the son of Hiram (1802–1833) and Emeline (Bowen) Ballou, a distinguished Huguenot family in Smithfield, Rhode Island. He lost his father at a young age. In spite of this, he attended boarding school at Nichols Academy in Dudley, Massachusetts and Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. After graduation from Phillips, he attended Brown University, where he was a member of Delta Phi, and went on to study law at the National Law School, in Ballston, New York. He was admitted to the bar in Rhode Island and began practice in 1853. Ballou married Sarah Hart Shumway on October 15, 1855. They had two sons, Edgar and William.\\"Dispatch Delayed\\", Washington Post, July 8, 2001. Transcribed at bessel.org. Accessed October 20, 2006. Ballou was active in public affairs. In 1854, soon after beginning his law practice, he was elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives. He was chosen as Clerk of the House, and later as the Speaker. He was a staunch Republican and supporter of Abraham Lincoln.The Sullivan Ballou letter. (2002) ==Civil War== After the bombardment of Fort Sumter in April 1861, President Lincoln called on the states to provide 75,000 militia troops to put down the rebellion. Ballou promptly volunteered, and encouraged others to do so as well. He was commissioned a major in the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry Regiment.Combined Military Service Record He was third in command of the Regiment, after Colonel John Slocum and Lieutenant Colonel Frank Wheaton. He was also appointed judge advocate of the Rhode Island militia. The 2nd Rhode Island soon moved to Washington, and joined the Union Army of Northeastern Virginia. On July 21, 1861 the regiment took part in the First Battle of Bull Run. As a senior officer, Ballou went in front on horseback to better direct his men. He was hit by a cannonball from a Confederate six-pounder cannon, which tore off part of his right leg and killed his horse. He was carried off the field, and the remainder of his leg was amputated. The Union Army was defeated and retreated to Washington, and Ballou was left behind. Ballou died from his wound a week after the battle, and was buried in the graveyard of nearby Sudley Church. He was one of 94 men of the 2nd Rhode Island killed or mortally wounded at Bull Run. He was 32 at the time of his death; his wife Sarah was 24. The battle area was occupied by Confederate forces, and Ballou's body was allegedly exhumed, decapitated, and further desecrated by Confederate troops (though most historians attribute this story to Northern wartime propaganda); his body was never recovered. In place of his body, charred ash and bone believed to be his remains were reburied in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence. Sarah remained a widow and never remarried. She later moved to New Jersey to live with her son, William. She died at age 82 in 1917; her remains are buried beside her husband's. ==Letter to Sarah Ballou== In his now famous letter to his wife, Ballou endeavored to express the emotions he was feeling: worry, fear, guilt, sadness, and the pull between his love for her and his sense of duty to the nation. The letter was featured prominently in the Ken Burns documentary The Civil War, where a shortened version of it was paired with Jay Ungar's musical piece \\"Ashokan Farewell\\" and read by Paul Roebling. The documentary excluded many of Ballou's personal references to his family and his upbringing. The letter may never have been mailed; it was found in Ballou's trunk after he died.Brown University in the Civil War. A Memorial. Providence Press Company: Providence, 1868. . It was reclaimed and delivered to Ballou's widow by Governor William Sprague, either after Sprague had traveled to Virginia to reclaim the effects of dead Rhode Island soldiers, or from Camp Sprague in Washington, D.C. ==References== https://www.nps.gov/resources/story.htm%3Fid%3D253 ==External links== *PBS: The Civil War * *Text of the letter set to music by John Kander, sung by soprano Renée Fleming *World of Warcraft: Sully Balloo's Letter Category:American letter writers Category:Union Army officers Category:Union military personnel killed in the American Civil War Category:People of Rhode Island in the American Civil War Category:Speakers of the Rhode Island House of Representatives Category:Members of the Rhode Island House of Representatives Category:Rhode Island Republicans Category:Rhode Island lawyers Category:State and National Law School alumni Category:Brown University alumni Category:Nichols College alumni Category:Phillips Academy alumni Category:People from Providence County, Rhode Island Category:Burials at Swan Point Cemetery Category:1829 births Category:1861 deaths Category:19th-century American politicians Category:19th-century American lawyers ","title":"Sullivan Ballou"},{"id":"2204894","text":" INS Trishul (F43) (Translated as Trident) is the second frigate of the of the Indian Navy. Trishul, the guided missile frigate, joined the arsenal of Indian Navy in 2003. The ship was commissioned by the then Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Naval Command Vice Admiral Arun Prakash at St. Petersburg, Russia on 25 June 2003. It has a complement of 32 officers and 228 sailors. In contrast to the lead ship INS Talwar, the sea trials of Trishul were considerably shortened as the ship performed well. Trishul arrived in Mumbai on 23 September 2003. ==Design== Trishul belongs to the Talwar-class of frigates. The Talwar-class guided missile frigates are modified Krivak III- class frigates built by Russia. These ships use stealth technologies and a special hull design to ensure a reduced radar cross section. Much of the equipment on the ship is Russian-made, but a significant number of systems of Indian origin have also been incorporated. ==Armament== The surface to air weapons systems include one single-rail MS-196 launcher that can launch the long range Shtil-1 (NATO: SA-17) surface-to-air missile. Eight Igla-1E (NATO: SA-16) portable air defence missiles are on board for short-range threats. Trishul became the second Indian warship to incorporate an eight cell KBSM 3S-14NE Vertical Launcher and was the first to upload the new Indian/Russian designed missile, the supersonic BrahMos PJ-10 ASCM (anti-sub/ship/surface cruise missile). Trishuls VLS can launch the Indian designed 3M-54E Klub-N (NATO: SS-N-27) subsonic ASCM. Trishul has one 100 mm A-190 (E) dual purpose gun mount for surface and air targets. Its rate of fire is 60 rounds a minute at a range of 15 km. Two Kashtan Air Defence Gun/Missile mounts are Trishuls Close-In Weapons System (CIWS). The Kashtan CIWS has two GSh-30k 30 mm Gatling guns per mount firing 5,000 rounds a minute, along with eight 9M-311 Grison missiles (NATO: SA-N-11) with a range of . There are 64 Grison reloads (32 each mount) with a package of four missile taking less than 2 minutes to load. Forward of Trishuls bridge and aft of the VLS is one 12-round RBU-6000 anti- submarine warfare rocket launch that can fire either Splav-90R rockets or RGB-60 depth charges. Two pairs of fixed 533 mm DTA-53 torpedo tubes are located port and starboard midships. Both can launch either SET-65E anti-sub and 53-65KE antiship torpedoes. ==Service history== In December 2005, Trishul collided with a commercial ship, Ambuja Laxmi, outside the Mumbai harbour, while returning from a training mission. Radar systems installed by the port authorities and those on board Ambuja Laxmi were unable to detect Trishul, and were unable to prevent the side-on collision. In the later part of 2017, Trishul was deployed on a four-month long anti piracy mission in the region of Gulf of Aden. The ship started at Mumbai in August 2017, and returned on 23 December 2017. During the period, the ship covered , carried out a bilateral exercise with the Italian Navy, exchange visits with the navies of Italy, Russia, United States, Japan, and Bangladesh. On 06 October 2017, Trishul successfully deterred a pirate attack on an Indian merchant vessel, MV Jag Amar. ==ReferencesExternal links == *Talwar Class - Bharat Rakshak *Talwar Class - Global Security Category:Talwar-class frigates Category:Frigates of the Indian Navy Category:2000 ships Category:Ships built at the Baltic Shipyard ","title":"INS Trishul (F43)"},{"id":"2204897","text":"Gene Lyons is an American political columnist who has defended former U.S. President Bill Clinton. == Writing == He and Joe Conason co-authored The Hunting of the President: The 10 Year Campaign to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton, a documentary book published in 2000, with a supporting film.

In the United Kingdom and Australia, after the Second World War, it was commonly used for tractors until diesel engines became commonplace. In Australian English it was known as power kerosene. ==History== TVO existed for at least fifteen years before it became widely used. A 1920 publication mentions it as a product of British Petroleum. But it was not until the late 1930s that it first became widely used. The post war Ferguson TE20 tractor, a carefully researched and near-ideal tractor for use on British farms, was designed around a petrol (gasoline) engine, the Standard inline-four. Although there was a campaign for the reintroduction of agricultural Road Duty (tax)-free petrol, which had been curtailed during the war, this was not forthcoming. Perkins Engines supplied some conversions into diesel engines which could use untaxed red diesel. On the early Fordson model N, the tap which changed over from petrol to TVO was marked G for gasoline and K for kerosene, reflecting that these tractors had their design origin in the USA. In the UK tractor vaporising oil was usually called TVO. ==Octane rating== As a substitute for petrol, TVO was developed. Paraffin (kerosene) was commonly used as a domestic heating fuel and was untaxed. Paraffin has a low octane rating and would damage an engine built for petrol. The manufacture of paraffin involves the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons from what is now sold as heating oil. These aromatics have an octane rating, so adding some of that otherwise waste product material back in a controlled manner into paraffin gave TVO. The resulting octane rating of TVO was somewhere between 55 and 70. ;Octane ratings of various fuels {  - ! Fuel ! Octane rating ! Notes -  Petrol  98  - -  Kerosene  15-20  - -  Paraffin  0  - -  Diesel fuel  0  - } ;Octane ratings of petrol/heating oil mixtures {  - ! Petrol (pbv) ! Heating oil (pbv) ! Octane rating -  1  0  98 -  2  1  72 -  1  1  59 -  1  2  46 -  0  1  20 } * pbv = parts by volume The words paraffin and kerosene are often used interchangeably but the tables suggest that this is incorrect because they have different octane ratings. However, kerosene and heating oil have similar octane ratings. Paraffin, kerosene and petrol (gasoline) are all rather loosely defined. For example, gasoline may have an octane rating between 88 and 102. ==Engine modificationsCompression ratio=== Because TVO has a lower octane rating than petrol, the engine needs a lower compression ratio. On the TVO version of the Ferguson TE20 tractor, the cylinder head was re-designed to reduce the compression ratio to 4.5:1. This reduced the power output, so the cylinder bore was increased to 85 mm to restore the power. The petrol version had a compression ratio of 5.77:1 and a cylinder bore of 80 mm on early versions.. ===Vaporiser=== In practice TVO had most of the properties of paraffin, including the need for heating to encourage vapourisation. As a result, the exhaust and inlet manifolds were adapted so that more heat from the former warmed the latter. Such a setup was called a vaporiser. To get the tractor to start from cold, a small second fuel tank was added that contained petrol. The tractor was started on the expensive petrol, then – once the engine was warm – the fuel supply switched over to TVO or paraffin. So long as the engine was working hard, as when ploughing or pulling a load, the TVO would burn well. Under light conditions, such as travelling unloaded on the highway, the engine was better on petrol. ===Radiator blind=== Some tractor designs included a radiator \\"blind\\" that would restrict the flow of air over the radiator which led to the engine running hotter, which could help with starting. If the radiator blind was left shut, though, there was a risk of engine damage, especially in warm weather. ==Terminology== The phrase petrol-paraffin engine is often used to describe an engine that uses TVO. This can be interpreted either as :*the use of the two fuels, starting on petrol then switching to the paraffin-based TVO :*the use of a mixture of petrol and paraffin as a substitute for the proper TVO ==Supply== TVO was withdrawn from sale by UK suppliers in 1974. An approximation to the correct specification can be made from petrol and heating oil (burning oil). In the UK there is an exception that permits the use of rebated kerosene and fuel oils in vintage vehicles. ==Notes and references== Category:Petroleum products Category:Tractors Category:Fuels Category:Internal combustion piston engines ","title":"Tractor vaporising oil"},{"id":"2204929","text":"Amy Ciupak Lalonde is a Canadian-born television and film actress from Pelham, Ontario.

Born in Kirk Sandall, Yorkshire, Mallender was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and a right-hand lower order batsman who improved as his career progressed. He played first-class cricket in England for Northamptonshire (1980-1986 and 1995-1996) and for Somerset (1987-1994). He also played for Otago (1983-84 to 1992-93), captaining the side in 1990-91 and 1991-92\\\\. ==Early life== Mallender was born in Kirk Sandall in Yorkshire, but spent the early part of his childhood in Somerset, before moving to Lincolnshire, where he attended Bourne Grammar School,He also attended Beverley Grammar School and was the first XI Captain in 1979, showing himself as a natural sportsman in cricket and football. During this time, he gained representative honours at schoolboy level for county and country, captaining England youth on a tour of the West Indies. ==Playing career== After school, he was courted by several counties, including his birth county of Yorkshire, but began his first-class career for Northamptonshire in 1980, having impressed on a tour of the West Indies with England Young Cricketers. A right-arm fast-medium bowler, and an increasingly useful lower-order batsman, he was capable of bowling at a sharp pace, operating within himself and using the conditions expertly. He won his county cap in 1984, but moved to Somerset in 1987. He was an important part of the rebuilding process at Taunton, and soon became popular with members and players alike. He had come close to selection twice for England, when the touring side were struggling with injuries in 1983-84 and 1991-92 as England searched for replacements to injury-hit squads during England tours to New Zealand, but he did not make his Test debut until 1992, in the home series against Pakistan at Headingley in July 1992, as his style was thought to be particularly suited to the Headingley pitch. Mallender proved to be a good selection, bowling with controlled swing and pace and able to lure the Pakistan batsmen, unfamiliar with the conditions, into rash strokes. He returned 5 for 50 in the second innings and 8 for 122 in the match to help England square the series 1-1. He retained his place for the fifth Test at The Oval, where he opened the bowling, but took only two lower-order wickets in the match, which Pakistan won decisively. He was then not selected for the winter tour to Sri Lanka and India, and never played Test cricket again. He had a Test bowling average of 10 wickets at 21.50. Mallender spent ten consecutive seasons (1983-84 to 1992-93) playing for Otago in New Zealand, for whom he became something of a local. He captained the side for two years (1990–91, 1991–92) and generally revelled in the New Zealand conditions, always featuring near the top of the bowling averages. He took over 250 first- class wickets, at a touch over 20 apiece, as well as scoring his only first- class century in 1991-92 against Central Districts. His efforts helped Otago (traditionally one of New Zealand domestic cricket’s bridesmaids) win the Shell Trophy twice during his stay. As a consequence Mallender was awarded the rare honour, to a foreigner, of a testimonial. Always whole-hearted and sometimes inspired, he left Somerset after a richly deserved benefit season in 1994 to return to Northamptonshire. But the length of time between injuries became ever shorter, and the body could clearly take no more. He called it a day in 1996 with 937 first-class wickets, and nearly 5,000 runs. ==Umpiring career== He later became an international umpire, officiating in three Tests in 2003-4, and twenty two ODIs between 2001 and 2003. He was appointed to the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires in 2004 , but chose to turn down the appointment due to family reasons . ==See also== * List of Test cricket umpires * List of One Day International cricket umpires ==ReferencesExternal links== * Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:English Test cricket umpires Category:English One Day International cricket umpires Category:England Test cricketers Category:English cricketers Category:Northamptonshire cricketers Category:Otago cricketers Category:Somerset cricketers Category:Buckinghamshire cricketers Category:Cricketers who have taken five wickets on Test debut Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:People educated at Beverley Grammar School Category:Sportspeople from Yorkshire Category:D.

All Bar One is a pub chain of just under 50 bars in the United Kingdom, owned and operated by Mitchells and Butlers plc which was part of the Six Continents group (previously Bass) until 2003. ==Décor== The concept was designed by Bass as a 'female friendly' bar at a time when many pubs and bars were considered intimidating places for single women to go and drink or eat, hence the huge glass frontage, the open plan space and the bright airy interiors. There were huge wooden tables. The design was formulated by Amanda Wilmott in February 1994.telegraph February 2002 This followed the lead of existing female-friendly bar chains such as Pitcher & Piano and Slug and Lettuce. Wilmott, a former director of Slug & Lettuce, designed a similar chain for Yates Brothers Wine Lodges called Ha! Ha! Bar & Canteen, which first opened in February 1998 in Bristol; Mitchells & Butlers bought the brand's 22 pubs for £19m from Bay Restaurant Group in September 2010, converting some of them to All Bar One pubs. Bass Leisure Retail opened another chain, Edward's, in the late 1990s that was similar. ==History== In October 1994, Wilmott found Mary-Jane Brook and Nelly Benstead to run the first outlet. The first bar was opened in December 1994 in Sutton, London, town centre by Bass Taverns, run by Sir Ian Prosser, who also owned Fork and Pitcher and Harvester. Bass bought Harvester in 1994. In its style, many pub chains have followed where All Bar One led. Five outlets opened in 1995 (including Islington, Wimbledon and Richmond in London). By 1996, Bass had 15 All Bar One pubs, 69 O'Neill's pubs and 102 Harvesters. By 1999 there were 46 in the chain. Jeremy Spencer, a friend of gastropub-inventor Mike Belben, was responsible for creating the brand of pub.Times, 29 April 2000 In 1999, Jeremy Spencer was replaced by Karen Forrester (who previously ran O'Neills, and who now runs T.G.I.

This is done by analyzing the messages promoting prejudiced power relationships found naturally in media and written material that go unnoticed otherwise by reading beyond the author's words and examining the manner in which the author has conveyed his or her ideas about society's norms to determine whether these ideas contain racial or gender inequality. == Overview == Critical literacy is an instructional approach, stemming from Marxist critical pedagogy, that advocates the adoption of \\"critical\\" perspectives toward text. Critical literacy is actively analysing texts and includes strategies for what proponents describe as uncovering underlying messages. The purpose of critical literacy is to create a self-awareness of the topic at hand. There are several different theoretical perspectives on critical literacy that have produced different pedagogical approaches. These approaches share the basic premise that literacy requires consumers of text to adopt a critical and questioning approach. When students examine the writer's message for bias, they are practicing critical literacy. This skill of actively engaging with the text can be used to help students become more perceptive and socially aware people who do not receive the messages around them from media, books, and images without first taking apart the text and relating its messages back to their own personal life experiences. Thus by getting students to question the power structures in their society, critical literacy teaches them how to dispute these written and oral views regarding issues of equality so that they may combat the social injustices against marginalized groups in their communities. According to proponents of critical literacy, the practice is not a means of attaining literacy in the sense of improving the ability to understand words, syntax, etc. The ability to read text is not required in order to engage in a critical discussion of \\"texts\\", which can include any medium of expression. It is important to express the idea behind discussion and understanding rather than merely learning the curriculum. With this idea in mind, students are able to look at what they are being taught as well as assessing what they are learning to their own situation. This means they are creating deeper meaning rather than studying content only. Critical literacyHagood, M. (2002). \\"Critical literacy for whom?\\",Reading Research and Instruction, 41, 247-264. has become a popular approach to teaching English to students in some English speaking-countries,Cadeiro-Kaplan, K. (2002) Literacy ideologies: Critically engaging the language arts curriculum. Language Arts, 79, 372-381 including Canada, Australia,Sinfield, Ivor., Hawkins, Lise (2006). \\" Critical Literacy: Policy and Practice\\". Orbit 36: 27. New Zealand, and the UK For post-structuralist practitioners of critical literacy, the definition of this practice can be quite malleable, but usually involves a search for discourses and reasons why certain discourses are included in or omitted from a text. Two major theoretical perspectives within the field of critical literacy are the Neo-Marxist/Freirean and the Australian. These approaches overlap in many ways and they do not necessarily represent competing views, but they do approach the subject matter differently == Relationship to critical thinking == While critical literacy and critical thinking involve similar steps and may overlap, they are not interchangeable. Critical thinking is done when one troubleshoots problems and solves them through a process involving logic and mental analysis. This is because critical thinking focuses on ensuring that one's arguments are sufficiently supported by evidence and void of unclear or deceptive presentation. Thus, critical thinking attempts to understand the outside world and recognize that there are other arguments beyond one's own by evaluating their reasoning for such arguments, but critical thinking does not go further beyond revealing a loaded claim. To make sense of the biases embedded within these claims first uncovered by critical thinking, critical literacy goes beyond identifying the problem to also analyzing the power dynamics that create the written or oral texts of society and then questioning their claims. Therefore, critical literacy examines the language and wording of politics within these texts and how politics uses certain aspects of grammar to convey its intended meaning. Practicing critical literacy lets students challenge both the author of the text in addition to the social and historical contexts in which the text was produced. In addition to print sources, critical literacy also evaluates media and technology by looking at who owns these forms of information as well as to whom they are writing and their goal in creating these various texts. Students look at the underlying information being communicated in literature, popular and online media, and journalism in the hopes of taking social action. ==History == Critical literacy practices grew out of the social justice pedagogy of Brazilian educator and theorist Paulo Freire, described in his 1967 Education as the Practice of Freedom and his 1968 Pedagogy of the Oppressed. Freirean critical literacy is conceived as a means of empowering populations against oppression and coercion, frequently seen as enacted by corporations or governments. Freirean critical literacy starts with the desire to balance social inequities and address societal problems caused by abuse of power - it is an analysis with an agenda. It proceeds from this philosophical basis to examine, analyze, and deconstruct texts. Critical literacy was later established more prominently with Donaldo Macedo in 1987. In his 1968 book, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Paulo Freire writes that individuals who are oppressed by those in positions of power are initially afraid to have freedom since they have internalized the rules of their oppressors and the consequences of not abiding by these rules. Thus, despite their internal desire for freedom, they continue to live in what Freire calls the \\"fear of freedom,\\" following a pre-set prescription of behaviors that meet their oppressors’ approval. In order to understand the actual nature of their oppression, Freire states that their education must teach them to understand that their reality can be changed and with it, their oppression. This perspective is reflected in the works of Peter McLaren, Henry Giroux, and Jean Anyon, among many others. The Freirean perspective on critical literacy is strongly represented in critical pedagogy. Critical pedagogy seeks to oppression by changing the way schools teach. From this emerges critical literacy, which states that by working to comprehend the way in which texts are written and presented, one may understand the political, social, and economic environments in which the text was formed as well as be able to identify hidden ideologies within such texts. Other philosophical approaches to critical literacy, while sharing many of the ideas of Neo-Marxist/Freirean critical literacy, may be viewed as a less overtly politicized expansion on these ideas. Critical literacy helps teachers as well as students to explore the relationship between theoretical framework and its practical implications. == Factors of critical literacy == Freire includes several basic factors in his formation of critical literacy. The first step of critical literacy involves bringing awareness, or \\"consciousness\\" as Freire terms it, to those who are mistreated and to those who bring about this mistreatment through promoting unfair ideologies via politics and other positions of power, such as schools and government. This is because Freire and Macedo hold that written texts also represent information that has been built on previous schemas about the world since the mistreated often are not conscious that they are oppressed, viewing their poverty or marginalization as a natural part of life. Accepting their hardship, they do not know the steps that would end their oppression. The second factor of critical literacy seeks to transform the way in which the schools teach. Ira Shor writes that critical literacy can be used to reveal one's subjective beliefs about the world by causing them to question their personal assumptions through using words. Able to be tailored to work with diverse ideas relating to feminism or neo-Marxism, critical literacy presents students with different ways of thinking about their self-development by challenging them to consider differing perspectives about issues rather than settle with the cultural norms and status quo. The goal of this is to lead students to promote social action within their community to change unjust structures. It is accomplished through advocating honest dialogue between the teacher and students in which both parties learn together through critical discussion of important issues rather than follow a banking model of education, which is a traditional method of teaching that treats students as empty containers, to be filled by teachers whose primary roles are to lecture and pass on information that students must receive and recite during tests. Freire was not a proponent of the banking model because he believed rather than creating conscious knowledge within students, this model he claimed perpetuated oppression. When teachers facilitate discussion between students regarding the controversial issues that pertain to them and their society, this honest dialogue acts as a bridge to allow students to question the social inequalities in their own communities and the underlying hierarchies that govern these prejudices. Honest dialogue between instructor and student leads students to the third factor: critical reflection of how they can apply the knowledge they have discovered through dialogue to their own life situations in order to take concrete actions to change society and right injustices. == Teaching critical literacy == By teaching critical literacy, teachers can help students take action by expanding their mindsets to better understanding the perspectives of other overlooked groups in society and thus, grow in appreciation for those who have a different culture and language than they do. Teachers can adapt the teaching of critical literacy to their classrooms by encouraging students to read analytically and challenge the social norms found in texts. They can form their own ideas to dispute the text and write a response to oppose, or support, its claims. Teachers can let students research social justice topic that they are interested in. This can lead students taking personal responsibility for social change in their communities. Having students dissect different texts from various sources and authors in order to uncover the authors’ biases resulting from his or her ingrained ideas of norms is another method for developing the skill of critical literacy as well as having students rewrite passages they read but from the viewpoints and circumstances of oppressed minority groups. Reading a multitude of different texts or additional readings that accompany the text can also help students practice critical literacy. One example of a modality that can aid students with their critical literacy skills is the use of a film. The use of a film can be implemented in a variety of different classes including: history, science, literature, and so on. By utilizing a film or other visual modality, students are able to become engaged in the content in a way they would have not gotten in a traditional lesson. Visual modalities like graphic novels give students a better chance to understand and create meaning behind the information they are given. This in turn allows students to provide more evidence and theories behind the information. === Student skills === Critical literacy allows students to develop their ability to understand the messages found in online articles and other sources of media such as news stations or journalism through careful analysis of the text and how the text is presented. Critical literacy teaches students how to identify discrimination within institutions of power and then to question these power dynamics when they appear in written and oral texts so that students may comprehend why certain topics such as racial slurs are controversial in society. Teachers help foster students’ higher order thinking through in-class discussions about these social topics in what is known as a dialogic environment. Here, the traditional banking model of teaching is replaced by teachers giving students a chance to openly express their ideas and thoughts on the issues being taught in class. Thirdly, critical literacy aids the growth of reading skills by allowing students to actively relate various texts to other texts to determine if the overall messages promote or discourages the marginalization of minority groups. Younger children can also learn to practice critical literacy by having a teacher read picture books out loud to them as the children learn to examine what messages the images and paragraphs in the picture books convey. By encouraging students to find ways these social issues relate to their own personal lives, students’ minds are expanded to see cultural and racial differences as a positive thing. Lastly, critical literacy prepares students to recognize the importance of language in the formation of politics, social hierarchy, race, and power because the way in which phrases are worded can impact the overall message. This also appears in the realm of education as schools and teachers must determine whether they will teach and request that students use only the standard academic dialect in class or allow them to continue using the dialect they learned in the home. Critical literacy causes students to rethink which variation of language they speak since the standard dialect is the prevalent one and contains more power. ==See also== {  * Allan Luke * Colin Lankshear * Critical pedagogy * Critical reading * Critical theory * Culture jamming * Discourse * Henry Jenkins * Information literacy * Intertextuality * Mashup  * Media literacy * Meme * Memetics * Participatory culture * Paulo Freire * Popular culture * Postpositivism * Scenario planning * Semiotics * Transmediation * Visual literacy } ==ReferencesFurther reading== Lankshear, C. & McLaren, P.

Its branded restaurants and bars include All Bar One, Miller & Carter, Nicholson's, Toby Carvery, Harvester, Browns Restaurants, Vintage Inns, Ember Inns, Son of Steak, Stonehouse Pizza & Grill, Crown Carveries, O’Neill’s, Premium Country Pubs, and Sizzling Pubs. The company also owns the ALEX brand based in Germany. ==HistoryHistoric brewing company=== The Cape Hill brewery, in Birmingham, on a circa 1925 postcard Mitchells & Butlers Brewery was formed by the merger of two breweries in 1898. The company merged with Bass in 1961. With the brand currently under ownership of Coors Brewers, the brewery closed in 2002 with production switched to Burton upon Trent. Their most famous beer was Brew XI (using Roman numerals, and so pronounced Brew Eleven), advertised with the slogan \\"for the men of the Midlands\\". It is now brewed under licence for Coors by Brains of Cardiff. ===Bass=== Bass plc, based in Burton-on-Trent, transformed into separate brewing and retail divisions following the Beer Orders of 1989 and then proceeded to build a large hotel portfolio alongside its bingo, betting and electronic leisure interests. In the late 1990s the latter interests were sold. On 21 July 1995, Bass bought 78 Harvester restaurants for £165 million from the Forte Group. ===Six Continents=== In 2000, Bass also divested its brewing arm and rebranded itself Six Continents before another split in April 2003 into two separate companies, with the hotel assets forming InterContinental Hotels Group and the Mitchells & Butlers name brought back for the pubs and restaurants company. In March 2003, Six Continents fought off a proposed £5.5 billion takeover by Hugh Osmond (Punch Taverns). ===M and B=== Mitchells & Butlers was formed on 15 April 2003. In April 2006, it was approached by a consortium led by Robert Tchenguiz in a £2.7 billion takeover, which was dropped in May 2006. In February 2008, Punch Taverns offered to merge with Mitchells & Butlers, but decided not to in April 2008. Mitchells & Butlers then took an interest in Punch's subsidiary, Spirit Group. ===Financial loss=== A Harvester pub with adjacent Travelodge in Colton, Leeds In January 2008, Mitchells & Butlers announced significant losses (£274million) arising out of closure of hedge positions taken in anticipation of a property joint venture that were eventually cancelled due to the credit crunch caused by the subprime mortgage financial crisis. ===Acquisitions=== By 2006, Mitchells & Butlers had 130 Harvester restaurants. In 2001, it added Arena, Ember Inns, Flares, Goose, Sizzling Pub Co, Browns, Alex and Inn Keeper's Lodge to its list of brands. In July 2006, Mitchells & Butlers purchased 239 pub restaurants (Beefeater and Brewers Fayre without a Premier Inn) from Whitbread for £497 million to strengthen its food business ahead of the introduction of a smoking ban in enclosed public spaces in England in 2007. It had first announced its interest in April 2006. In July 2008 Mitchells & Butlers bought 44 restaurants from Whitbread – its former Brewers Fayre and Beefeater outlets that were not next to a Premier Inn. In September 2010 Mitchells & Butlers bought the 22 restaurants of the (upmarket) Ha Ha! chain from the Bay Restaurant Group for £19.5 million. Twelve were turned into All Bar One and six into Browns Restaurants. The Ha Ha! brand disappeared. In June 2014, the company announced plans to acquire the bulk of one of its major competitors, Orchid Group, for £266 million. The acquisition included 173 pubs. ===Sale of pubs=== In October 2006, Mitchells & Butlers sold off 102 of its smaller community pubs to Chorley-based Trust Inns for £101 million. On 15 July 2010, it was announced that Travelodge had acquired the leases of 52 Innkeeper's Lodge Hotels around Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool, Northampton, Milton Keynes and Leeds areas from Mitchells & Butlers. It also sold its 25 Hollywood Bowl outlets in August 2010 for £39 million to AMF Bowling. In November 2010, Mitchells & Butlers sold 333 pubs to the Stonegate Pub Company (of London and owned by TDR Capital) for £373 million. ===Poor results and dismissal of CEO=== In September 2015, Mitchells & Butlers issued a profits warning and dismissed CEO Alistair Darby. He was replaced by Phil Urban, who joined as COO in January from Grosvenor Casinos and previously ran Whitbread's pub restaurants division. ==Operations== Mitchells & Butlers owns several brands of pubs, including: * Alex * All Bar One * Browns Restaurants * Castle * Crown Carveries * Ember Inns * Harvester * Innkeeper's Lodge * Oak Tree * Orchid Pubs * Premium Country Pubs (formerly Premium Country Dining Group) * Miller and Carter * Nicholson's * O'Neill's * Sizzling Pubs * Stonehouse Pizza & Carvery * Toby Carvery * Vintage Inns Nicholson's pubs tend to be historic pubs aimed at the tourist market, located in London and other historic cities.

Vinylon, also known as Vinalon, is a synthetic fiber produced from polyvinyl alcohol, using anthracite and limestone as raw materials. Vinylon was first developed in Japan in 1939 by Ichiro Sakurada, Ri Sung Gi, and H. Kawakami.Patent no. 147,958, February 20, 1941, Ichiro Sakurada, Yi Sung-ki [Lee. S. or Ri. Sung．Gi. and Hiroshi Kawakami, issued to Institute of Japan Chemical Fiber. Trial production began in 1954 and in 1961 the massive February 8 Vinylon Complex was built in Hamhung, North Korea. Vinylon's widespread usage in North Korea is often pointed to as an example of the implementation of the juche philosophy, and it is known as the juche fiber. Vinylon is the national fiber of North Korea and is used for the majority of textiles, outstripping fiber such as cotton or nylon, which is produced only in small amounts in North Korea. Other than clothing, vinylon is also used for shoes, ropes, and quilt wadding. Japanese-Canadian textile artist Toshiko MacAdam used vinylon in her early works, as it was more economical than nylon. Vinylon is resistant to heat and chemicals but has several disadvantages: being stiff, having a relatively high manufacturing cost, and being difficult to dye. Synthesis of vinylon. == Colonial origins == Between the years 1910 to 1945, Korea was ruled as a Japanese colony. This fact forced the integration of Korea into the Japanese empire's economic and political spheres. Thus, after the Second Sino- Japanese War began in 1937, Korea was integrated into the Japanese war effort. It was amid Japan's efforts towards creating a more scientific and technologically advanced country for the war when a team of researchers worked to fabricate Vinylon. The first successful creation of Vinylon was in 1939, by a Kyoto University research team in Japan.Lee, Hy-Sang. North Korea : a Strange Socialist Fortress. Westport, Conn., Praeger, 2001. However, Vinylon was later brought to North Korea by Ri Sung-Gi, one of the researchers of the Kyoto University team, amid North Korean campaign aimed at the recruitment of scientists and engineers from South Korea in the period following Korea's liberation from Japan in 1945. He was working as a professor at Seoul National University at the time. During the Korean war, when Seoul was occupied by the Democratic People's Army, Ri was offered a research position in North Korea. Ri Sung-Gi accepted and defected to the North. == Original purpose == After the liberation of Korea in 1945, North Korea was under Soviet occupation and thus provided with aid by the Soviets as a means to stabilize the country. Beginning at the end of the Korean War in 1953, the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries began actively providing foreign aid to North Korea.Kim, Jiyoung. “The Politics of Foreign Aid in North Korea.” The Korean Journal of International Studies , vol. 12, no. 2, Dec. 2014, pp. 425–450. Therefore, the North Korean economy heavily depended on aid from other socialist countries. However, in the 1960s, the aid from the Soviet Union decreased. North Korea was no longer receiving aid in the form of grants, but loans. Hence, the North Korean leadership decided to accelerate efforts towards developing a self-sufficient economy. This resulted in the full mobilization of domestic resources. Beginning in 1961, North Korea launched its First Seven-Year Economic Development Plan, which focused on technological innovations, cultural revolution, improvement of living standards, modernization of the economy, and the facilitation of trade and international economic cooperation. As a result, the North Korean government decided to develop the vinylon industry and build Vinylon City. == Vinylon City == Hungnam, North Korea. In the early stages of North Korea's history, the government under Kim Il Sung and the official \\"juche\\" (self-reliance) ideology promoted the idea that the only way to reach the goal of economic independence was through heavy machine industry.Lee, Grace. \\"The Political Philosophy of Juche.\\" Stanford Journal of East Asian Affairs 3, no. 1 (2003): 105-12. The manufacturing of vinylon was therefore taken as a step towards developing North Korea as a modern industrial state. With such an appeal to nationalism, the North Korean government mobilized its citizens for constructing and supporting a new vinylon factory, called Vinylon City.Cheehyung Harrison Kim. “North Korea's Vinalon City: Industrialism as Socialist Everyday Life.” Positions, vol. 22, no. 4, 2014, p. 809. In 1961, Vinylon City, the factory compound for producing vinylon, was built in the northeastern industrial city of Hungnam. The construction of the factory took fourteen months, which was quite fast considering that fifty buildings made up Vinylon City. Vinylon City had a total floor space of , 15,000 production machines, 1,700 container tanks, and of piping. The tallest building in Vinylon City, measuring in height with a smokestack, was the acetic acid shop. The spinning shop, which was responsible of creating the vinylon fiber and shipping, was the largest building — long and wide, with floor space. Vinylon City became the pride of North Korea, being touted as having been built without foreign assistance. The success of Vinylon City demonstrated independence from the Soviet Union and China and appeared to reflect the juche ideology. Even though workers had to complete dangerous tasks and some ultimately lost their lives for the sake of demonstrating the country's capabilities, vinylon thus served as a reinforcement of the party's ideological command and the Kim family's rule. The city began with a goal of producing enough fiber to supply the entire country with clothing, shoes, and other necessities, a goal that appears to have been met for several decades. The fiber produced from Vinylon City was considered so important that during the annual commemoration of Kim Il-sung's birthday, the people were given gifts of vinylon clothing.Demick, Barbara. Nothing to Envy : Ordinary Lives in North Korea. 1st ed. New York: Spiegel & Grau, 2009. Print. However, the North Korean economy eventually collapsed, and fuel shortages forced the city to close down in 1994.“Kim Jong-Il attends factory reopening ceremony.” The hankyoreh, The Hankyoreh Media Company, Mar. 2010. Vinylon City remained closed for sixteen years, until its re-opening in 2010. == Re-opening of the Vinylon Complex == On February 8, 2010, Kim Jong-il visited the former Vinylon City complex in Hamhung to celebrate its reopening.North korea radio reports on leader's trip to vinalon factory. (2011, Aug 10). BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/881886044 Kim was accompanied by high- ranking officers of the party, such as the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly Kim Yong-nam, Defense Minister Kim Young-chun and Korean Workers’ Party secretaries Kim Ki-nam and Choi Tae-bok. This was the first documented time he ever attended an industrial mass rally. While his attendance, and that of the most important party members, could signify the importance of the vinylon complex and its role in advancing the economic policies of Kim Jong-il, there is evidence that the facility could play a role in the North Korean nuclear weapons program. Based on an analysis of satellite imagery, information from Ko Chong-song (a North Korean official who had defected), and a number of North Korean technical documents, there is speculation that the Hamhung plant is manufacturing unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine, a rocket fuel that is used in North Korean long-range missiles. == Historical significance == Although vinylon was initially used to help develop the North Korean economy as a home-grown product, it also became intertwined with juche nationalism. As a result, vinylon became a firm part of the North Korean national identity. ==ReferencesExternal links== * NKChosun.com * Fibers-Poly-Vinyl-Alcohol Category:Korean clothing Category:Science and technology in North Korea Category:Synthetic fibers Category:Korean inventions Category:Japanese inventions ","title":"Vinylon"},{"id":"2205045","text":"John Robert Williamson AM (born 1 November 1945) is an Australian country music and folk music singer-songwriter multi-instrumentalist, television host and conservationist. Williamson usually writes and performs songs that relate to the history and culture of Australia, particularly the outback, in a similar vein to Slim Dusty and Buddy Williams before him. Williamson has released over fifty albums, ten videos, five DVDs, and two lyric books and has sold more than 4,000,000 albums in Australia. His best known hit is \\"True Blue\\". On Australia Day (26 January) in 1992 Williamson was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) with the citation: \\"for service to Australian country music and in stimulating awareness of conservation issues\\". He has received twenty-six Golden Guitar trophies at the Country Music Awards of Australia, he has won three ARIA Music Awards for Best Country Album and, in 2010, was inducted into the related Hall of Fame. ==Early life== John Robert Williamson was born on 1 November 1945 at Kerang Bush Nursing Hospital to Keith Williamson and Shirley Ellen (née Manuel). He grew up in Quambatook, in the Mallee district of north-western Victoria. His parents farmed wheat crops on various small land lots in the region and both were amateur performing artists singing in local Gilbert and Sullivan productions. Williamson is the oldest of five sons with Robin as the third oldest. ==Origins and beginnings== Williamson's performance style originates from his 'farmland, not city bitumen' lifestyle, and his upbringing is referred to by the nickname, 'The Mallee Boy'. His early musical influences were Roger Miller and Rolf Harris, both of whom provided inspirational elements for his first hit, namely using a vocal imitation from Miller's \\"Dang Me\\" and replacing Rolf's wobble board with a Jaw's Harp. From the age of seven he learned to play the ukulele from his father, before proceeding when he was twelve to guitar and taught himself to play harmonica. For the last four years of secondary schooling Williamson attended Scotch College in Melbourne. In the early 1960s, while still at college, he formed a folk music group. After schooling Williamson returned home to become a farmer and, in 1965, the family moved to Croppa Creek, near Moree, where Williamson began performing at a local restaurant. ==Career1970s=== In 1969 John Williamson wrote a novelty song, \\"Old Man Emu\\", and early the following year he performed the track on TV talent quest, New Faces, winning first place. He later reflected on his songwriting process, and the importance of his guitar, \\"no matter where I go I'll have one with me, in case I come up with a song, I've got to have the guitar straight away. I always write the words and the music together\\". In early 1970 he signed a recording contract with Fable Records owner and New Facess judge, Ron Tudor. In May \\"Old Man Emu\\" was released as a single on Tudor's label, which peaked at No. 3 on the Go-Set National Top 60. It was awarded a gold certification and was listed at No. 14 on Go-Sets Top Records for the Year of 1970. His self-titled debut album followed in mid-year and, although it featured \\"Old Man Emu\\", it had little commercial success: only selling two-thousand copies. Since \\"Old Man Emu\\" was his only hit he had to perform it two or three times per gig. Williamson's follow-up single, \\"Under the Bridge\\" backed with \\"The Unexplored Shadows of Mine\\" was issued in November with certain pressings having its A and B-sides swapped around. By February 1971 the album's third single, \\"Beautiful Sydney\\", appeared. A string of non-album singles followed including, in March 1972, \\"Misery Farm\\" with Lumpy Pumpkin. In 1973 Williamson hosted a country music TV series, Travlin' Out West, which ran for two years, broadcast by NBN-3, Newcastle. He performed with two regular acts, Ricky & Tammy, and Emma Hannah. The program provided two albums for the regulars, Travlin' Out West in Concert (1973) and From Travlin' Out West (1974) issued by Reg Grundy Productions. In 1976 he issued his second album, The Comic Strip Cowboy, but it failed to chart. In early 1978, Williamson released his first compilation album under the Country Greats series. This was followed later in the year by his third album, Road to Town, with contributions by other musicians including Tommy Emmanuel on guitar. Also that year Williamson formed a country music band, Crow, which performed on the pub and club circuit across Australia. In 1980 Crow were renamed as Sydney Radio, to play rock music with a reggae influence. The members used face paint, with Williamson disguised as the clown, Ludwig Leichhardt. Williamson penned rock and reggae numbers for the band some of which were recorded but never released. Since 1970 Williamson has had a friendship with radio presenter, John Laws, who calls Williamson his 'little brother'. In 1977, Williamson recorded and released a single, \\"It's a Grab It While It's Goin' Kind of Life\\", which is a musical tribute to Laws. Up until Laws' first retirement on 25 June 2007, Williamson wrote and performed a series of jingles for Laws' morning show on 2UE, and his final jingle was \\"Hey good on ya Lawsie, you pulled the plug at last\\". Laws made a successful comeback to radio broadcasting in February 2011, this time at 2SM, part of the Super Radio Network, and Williamson's jingles for his programme resumed. ===1980s=== In early 1981 John Williamson's rock group, Sydney Radio, disbanded and he began playing solo in pubs, which attracted more new fans. He recorded a tribute song for ANZACs, \\"Diggers of the ANZAC (This Is Gallipoli)\\", which was well received and issued as a single. Williamson met Pixie Jenkins, a fiddle player, and the two toured together for several years. In April 1981 Williamson issued a single, \\"The Breaker\\", featuring narrated vocals by Charles 'Bud' Tingwell, which was inspired by the movie, Breaker Morant (1980) (which had Tingwell as a supporting actor). \\"The Breaker\\" enabled Williamson to cast off the \\"Old Man Emu\\" novelty tag and \\"[h]is long apprenticeship flowed into an apparently endless set of songs charming Australians with stories and images about themselves and their country\\". In 1982, he recorded a new track, \\"True Blue\\", which was included on a compilation album, True Blue: The Best of John Williamson. Later that year, he issued Fair Dinkum J.W., featuring traditional Australian ballads, \\"With My Swag upon My Shoulder\\", \\"Botany Bay\\" and \\"Brisbane Ladies\\"; as well as originals, \\"Country Football\\", \\"Kill the Night\\", \\"Wrinkles\\" and \\"(You've Gotta Be) Fair Dinkum\\", a duet with Karen Johns. In 1983 Williamson released his first solo live album, Singing in the Suburbs and another live album, The Smell of Gum Leaves, in September 1984. It featured another comic track, \\"I'm Fair Dinkum\\". Williamson then launched his merchandise business, The Fair Dinkum Road Company, in Sydney. The album included his cover version of Spectrum's 1971 single, \\"I'll Be Gone\\", which he played using only guitar and harmonica. At the start of 1985 he founded an independent record label, Gumleaf Recordings. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January that year, he won 'Song of the Year' for \\"Queen in the Sport of Kings\\". He then issued a new compilation, Humble Beginnings, featuring tracks from his first three studio albums. He released another studio album that year, Road Thru the Heart. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1986, he won 'Album of the Year' for Road Thru the Heart and 'Male Vocalist of the Year' for \\"You and My Guitar\\". In July 1986, Williamson released another compilation, All the Best! which contained eighteen of his most-requested tracks both from studio and live works. As a bonus, Williamson collaborated with both of his daughters, Ami and Georgie, and with Australian folk group Bullamakanka on \\"Goodbye Blinky Bill\\" – highlighting the comic koala character of the same name. When issued as a single, the purchase price included an A$1.00 donation to the Koala Preservation Society in Port Macquarie. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1986, he won 'Album of the Year' for Road Thru the Heart and 'Male Vocalist of the Year' for \\"You and My Guitar\\". In November 1986 Williamson's Gumleaf Recordings distributed his breakthrough album, Mallee Boy, which peaked in the Top 10 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart. Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1974 until Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) created their own charts in mid-1988. It remained in the top 50 for a year-and-a-half, and was awarded a triple platinum certificate. It was \\"filled with storytelling that spanned from his own beginnings on that farm in the Victorian Mallee to every corner of the nation\\". At the ARIA Music Awards of 1987, Mallee Boy was named the inaugural winner of Best Country Album. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1987, he won 'Album of the Year' for Mallee Boy and 'Male Vocalist of the Year' for \\"True Blue\\". Popular tracks include the title song, \\"Galleries of Pink Galahs\\" (see Galah), \\"Raining on the Rock\\" (see Uluru) and \\"Cootamundra Wattle\\" (see Acacia baileyana). The album had a re-recorded version of \\"True Blue\\" which was released as a single in September. Williamson was asked by the Australian Made Campaign whether they could use \\"True Blue\\" for their TV and radio ads. It became a career highlight and was adopted as a theme by the Australia national cricket team. To support Mallee Boy Williamson performed his concerts in a camp fire setting and since that time he commences many of his shows with its title track. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1988, he won 'Top Selling Album' for Mallee Boy. In April 1988 Williamson issued his seventh studio album, Boomerang Café, which peaked at No. 10 on the Kent Music Report. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1989, Boomerang Café won his second award for Best Country Album. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1989, he won 'Top Selling Album' and 'Album of the Year' for Boomerang Café. Despite the title song's lyrics, Williamson has told concert audiences that he did not actually meet his future wife, Mary-Kay, in The Boomerang Cafe but actually by a water tank. Williamson performed at the opening of the New Parliament House. In September 1989, he issued Warragul (meaning dingo in the Wiradjuri language), which became his first number-one album the following month. That same year Variety Club named him 'Entertainer of the Year'. ===1990s=== At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 1990, John Williamson won 'Top Selling Album' and 'Album of the Year' for Warragul, and 'Heritage Award' for \\"Drover's Boy\\". At the ARIA Music Awards of 1990, Warragul earned his third Best Country Album award. In October 1990 Williamson released JW's Family Album which reached No. 21. In 1990 a new version of \\"Old Man Emu\\" appeared as a single, with a new lyric added: \\"He can run the pants off a dingo too\\". In September 1992 his next album, Waratah St, was released it reached No. 14 on the ARIA Albums Chart, and had received a gold certificate on pre-sale orders. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1992, he won 'Top Selling Album' for JW's Family Album. Late in 1991 he combined with other country musicians, Slim Dusty, Joy McKean, Phil Matthews and Max Ellis to organise the founding of the Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA), which \\"would fight for the interests of the Australian country music industry particularly in regard to the Awards\\". It was launched in January 1992 with Dusty as inaugural chairman and Williamson as vice-chairman and later that year CMAA took over the organisation of the Country Music Awards of Australia – established in 1973 – from radio station, 2TM based in Tamworth. Williamson's compilation, Australia Calling – All the Best Vol 2, was released in October, which peaked at number 32 and was certified platinum. Its lead single, \\"Australia Calling\\", was also released while another new track was the studio recording of \\"I'll Be Gone\\", and was used to raise awareness for homeless youth. At the beginning of 1993, Williamson issued Love is a Good Woman, a compilation of his love songs, with new tracks \\"Good Woman\\" and \\"Misty Blue\\". In September that year, after watching the TV announcement that Sydney had won the bid to host the 2000 Summer Olympics, Williamson wrote \\"Sydney 2000\\" and was invited to perform it on the steps of the Sydney Opera House. A year later, it was recorded for his next album, Mulga to Mangoes, which peaked at No. 14\\\\. Associated singles were \\"Seven Year Itch\\", \\"River Crying Out\\" and \\"Tropical Fever\\". At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1995, he won 'Video Track of the Year' for \\"Tropical Fever\\" – directed by Mark Jago. During the year he celebrated twenty-five years in the Australian music industry with a new compilation, True Blue – The Very Best of John Williamson, which reached the top 30. It included two new tracks, \\"Bush Town (The Lawnmower Song)\\" and \\"No-one Loves Brisbane Like Jesus\\". At that time, he published his book, True Blue: Stories and Songs of Australia, which contains the lyrics of his songs and explanations of their composition. Williamson was surprised at the book's launch by Mike Munro as part of the TV documentary series, This is Your Life. He appeared on the series again in 2000 when Slim Dusty was the subject of an episode. At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 1996, Williamson won 'Top Selling Album' for Mulga to Mangoes. He released Family Album No.2 in September 1996. In January the following year he was inducted to the Country Music Association of Australia's Roll of Renown. Williamson's thirteenth studio album Pipe Dream was released in August 1997 and peaked at No. 6. At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 1998 he won 'Top Selling Album' for Pipe Dream. \\"Sir Don\\", his tribute to cricketer Donald Bradman, is on the album. Williamson performed \\"Raining on the Rock\\" as a duet with Warren H Williams. The following year, at the Australian Country Music Awards, the pair won 'Collaboration of the Year'. Williamson soon took part in his short-lived television series on the Seven Network called The Bush Telegraph. Following this for a moderate period, Williamson continued touring Australia and was also releasing a series of compilations. In July 1999 his fourteenth studio album, The Way It Is was released and peaked at No. 10, it went gold after eight weeks. At the end of 1999, he published his first calendar, by using photography from Steve Parish. ===2000s=== At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2000 John Williamson won 'Top Selling Album' for The Way It Is, 'Heritage Song of the Year' for \\"Campfire on the Road\\" and 'Bush Ballad of the Year' for \\"Three Sons\\". He released his next compilation album, Anthems – A Celebration of Australia in August 2000, which peaked at No. 16. A new single, \\"This Ancient Land\\", was recorded with country music veteran, Jimmy Little, for Corroboree that year. Other anthem tracks include \\"A Number on My Back\\" for the national rugby union team, Wallabies, and \\"The Baggy Green\\" with vocals by national cricket captain Steve Waugh. Also on the album are \\"Waltzing Matilda 2000\\" and a studio recording of \\"Advance Australia Fair\\" for the first time. He was invited to perform at the opening ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics. Williamson performed \\"Sir Don\\" at Bradman's Memorial Service in Adelaide in 2001. The original scraps of paper he used to compose the track are displayed in the Bradman Museum, Bowral. He also represented Australia when performing at the Opening Ceremony of Winterlude in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In April 2002, Williamson released his fifteenth studio album, Gunyah, which in the traditional Aboriginal language means 'home'. The opening track \\"Sing You the Outback\\" revealed how important the Australian outback has been in the past and how invaluable it will be into the future. The next two tracks, \\"Frangipani Bay\\" and \\"Cape York Peninsula\\", were written during a road trip to Australia's most northern point. The lyrics in \\"The Devil's Boots\\" relate to the bushranger, Ned Kelly. \\"Buried in Her Bedclothes\\" was written after Williamson and Mary-Kay, his spouse of the time, met an elderly woman on an Indian Pacific rail trip. Her husband had died six months earlier and she had refused to get out of bed for three months. Her family suggested the train trip as a remedy – she shared her memories with the Williamsons and said that the train 'had done the job'. Williamson referred to 2003 as his 'most True Blue year ever'. He was elected President of the CMAA after Dusty retired. He then released the sequel to the 1995 compilation True Blue Two, which reached No. 8. It featured his hit songs up to the Gunyah album and exclusively including five new tracks. On 12 October, Williamson was asked by the Prime Minister, John Howard, to perform \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" at the Memorial Service for the first Anniversary of the 2002 Bali bombings. At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2004 Williamson and Sara Storer won 'Vocal Collaboration of the Year' and 'Single of the Year' for \\"Raining on the Plains\\", and the track won 'Song of the Year' which was shared with Storer and her co-writers, Garth Porter and Doug Storer. The track is on Storer's 2002 album, Beautiful Circle. With regard to new arrangements of John's songs, having recorded a cover version of Stan Coster's \\"Wobbly Boot Hotel\\" on Waratah St in 1991, he re-recorded it in 2004 as a duet with Coster's daughter Tracy on \\"Coster Country\\", her tribute album to him. 2005 was a productive year for John in terms of recording and touring; he re-recorded \\"Wrinkles\\" as a duet with John Stephan, issued a twenty-track compilation of Queensland- themed songs, called \\"From Bulldust to Bitumen\\", available only to RACQ members, and in August, Chandelier of Stars was released, which reached No. 11 on the ARIA Albums Chart. At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2006 he won 'Album of the Year' and 'Top Selling Album' for Chandelier of Stars, and the track \\"Bells in a Bushman's Ear\\" won 'Bush Ballad of the Year'. In discussing John's wife of the time, the opening track, \\"Little Girl from the Dryland\\", describes Mary-Kay and her childhood in Tulloona Bore, south of Boggabilla, from her point of view. \\"Chandelier of Stars\\" is a description of the night sky before sunrise. \\"Bells in a Bushman's Ear\\" is a tribute to Australia's country music forefathers, and \\"The Camel Boy\\" is about the life of indigenous artist, Albert Namatjira, who is Warren H Williams' great uncle. \\"Keeper of the Stones\\", which first appeared on Williamson's live album and DVD of 2004, Mates on the Road, was dedicated to indigenous Australians of The Stolen Generation. \\"Desert Child\\", another duet with Williams is a bush lullaby for Aboriginal children. Also on Chandelier of Stars is \\"A Country Balladeer\\" which is a duet with Chad Morgan, and \\"Flower on the Water\\" is a tribute to the victims of the Bali bombings. The first four lines are inspired by words on a photo of a deceased victim: \\"To hear your voice, to see you smile / To sit and talk to you awhile / To be together the same old way / That would be our greatest wish today\\". Williamson found the author and started a friendship. The following November, Williamson released the new song \\"We Love This Country\\" on a compilation of the same name with his favourite holiday songs to promote Australian tourism with caravans – it became a jingle for Jayco commercials. He promoted the aforementioned projects of 2005 together with Pixie Jenkins and Warren H. Williams as part of their True Blue Reunion Tour. In August 2006, The Platinum Collection, a three-disc set of Williamson's hits from 1970 - 2005 was released. In September, Williamson was devastated after hearing of the death of fellow wildlife conservationist and friend, Steve Irwin. In reaction to the news, he wrote a tribute tune, \\"Wildlife Warriors: It's Time\\". He was evidently emotional while performing both \\"Home Among the Gum Trees\\" and \\"True Blue\\" at Irwin's memorial service inside the arena of his Australia Zoo Crocoseum. The service was filmed live- to-air and later released on DVD. Wildlife Warriors was additionally released in November 2006 on a compilation album of the same name, along with twelve of Williamson's favourite conservation awareness tracks and his two live performances from Irwin's memorial. At the beginning of 2008 Williamson decided to put together a musical. Based on his music and lyrics, the book by Simon Heath and directed by Bernie Zelvis, Williamson named it Quambatook – The Musical. On 7 February 2008, the musical was premiered at the EVAN Theater in Penrith to positive reviews, making it a major highlight in the history of Australian musical theatre. The album Hillbilly Road was released in August 2008. The lyrics for the album were inspired by his home in Springbrook. Subsequent singles that followed were \\"Cydi\\", \\"Drink a Little Love\\", \\"Australia Is Another Word for Free\\" as a trio with Williams and Amos Morris, and \\"Better Than a Picture\\". \\"The Joy Is in the Journey\\" was a special bonus addition to finish the album, previously appearing on the Quambatook Musical soundtrack. The Hillbilly Road album was promoted everywhere around Australia until early the next year when Williams decided to move on and pursue other musical projects, leaving Williamson to perform the rest of the tour solo. At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2009 he won 'Bush Ballad of the Year' for \\"Australia Is Another Word for Free\\", performed by Williamson, Williams and Morris. By late 2009 Williamson got together with fellow country star Adam Harvey and recorded their cover to Roger Miller's \\"King of the Road\\", issued both as a single and on Harvey's duets album Both Sides Now. Williamson then made his Carols By Candlelight debut at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl. ===2010s=== On 26 January (Australia Day) 2010 Williamson released a new Australian anthem called \\"Island of Oceans\\" as a duet with Shannon Noll. Williamson released a new double-CD compilation album Absolute Greatest: 40 Years True Blue commemorating this milestone. At a press conference for the album in Tamworth on 21 January hosted by the then Governor-General Quentin Bryce, in his acceptance speech, John expressed his gratitude for the longevity of his career up to that point, in the process thanking his fans, friends and family, including his first wife, Mary-Kay. On 28 January 2011 Williamson released a recording of a concert with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra at the Sydney Opera House. At the Australian Country Music Awards in Tamworth that same month John presented Jimmy Little with the Lifetime Achievement Award. In January 2012, Williamson released The Big Red. The first two singles lifted from the work are \\"Hang My Hat in Queensland\\" and the title track. Early in 2013 \\"Prairie Hotel Parachilna\\" was released. In 2013, a new two-disc set of John's hits, Hell of a Career was released. In 2014, Williamson released his fiftieth album (including compilations) called Honest People, as well as writing his autobiography, issued by Penguin. Both were released on 25 July 2014. As well as this, he made his debut as an exhibitionist painter. In 2014, it was announced by John via A Current Affair that he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. In April 2016, he released an EP called Looking for a Story, a new ANZAC tribute and six other sets of previously issued lyrics. John released his twentieth studio album Butcherbird in August 2018. ===2020s=== In 2020, Williamson celebrated 50 years since the release of \\"Old Man Emu\\", by releasing a 25xCD single box set, featuring 50 tracks spanning his career. Williamson said \\"Putting together this collection gave me a chance to take stock of what I've achieved during my career... While I'm not looking to retire just yet, once I've completed my 2020 Winding Back Tour I'll be scaling down my live appearances. I've always loved the connection I receive when performing, so you'll still see me popping up at festivals and special events. Winding Back mainly means I'm looking forward to spending more time in the garden and less time away from home fiddling about with those hard to open motel soaps.\\" JW 50 - Winding Back 1970-2020 was released on 19 June 2020 and peaked at number 50 on the ARIA Charts. ==DiscographyStudio albums=== * John Williamson (1970) * Comic Strip Cowboy (1976) * Road to Town (1978) * Fair Dinkum J.W.

Her parents had farmed on Tulloona Plain between Moree and Goondiwindi, and her father was a World War II soldier-settler. In 1973, Williamson married Mary-Kay on her parents' farm. The couple have two daughters, Ami and Georgie. Ami recalled \\"[w]hen Dad was away, he was really away\\". Over his career Williamson has written some love songs for Mary-Kay including \\"Little Girl from the Dryland\\". On 23 April 2007, after more than 30 years of marriage, Williamson and Mary- Kay divorced.Bob Rogers Show, Radio 2CH, 11:35 AEST 23 April 2007. Williamson admitted that he preferred Springbrook in south-east Queensland to unwind and get inspiration for new material. Following his marriage break-up, Williamson formed a relationship with a new partner, Meg Doyle, who organises some of his activities. The couple divide their time living together between Springbrook and their Sydney apartment and were married in March 2013. His daughter, Ami, is also a musician, who has toured with Williamson. In early 2008, she toured Australian Defence Force bases in Iraq and Afghanistan to play to troops: she appeared on two episodes, \\"Show of Force\\", on Australian Story (May 2008) describing the tour. Williamson also appeared on the same episodes he had advised his daughter \\"to sing stuff that's going to be good for the boys\\". Ami explained her motivation for going \\"I've got, you know, a history of entertainers in my family ... [who] have performed for the military, my dad has, so I feel like I've taken the baton, which is cool\\". In terms of his political views, Williamson is a republican. Williamson has stated in interviews that he does not like cats because of their lazy, selfish and sometimes destructive behaviour. \\"Bill the Cat\\" from Warragul is a humorous presentation of a serious message that points out the damage that feral cats do to wildlife. His middle brother Robin died of cancer in 1999. Williamson's 2002 album \\"Gunyah\\", in particular the track \\"Salisbury Street\\", was dedicated to Robin. Salisbury Street was the location of their second home in Quambatook.CD insert, Gunyah, 2002. ==Criticism and controversy== \\"Call Me Blue\\" from the nineteenth album, Honest People, was written in reaction to the verbal abuse that Williamson received after resigning as president of the CMAA. He gave up the position of his own volition, unhappy with the \\"growing influence of American music\\". ==Bibliography== John Williamson has written or co-written the following: * . * . * . * . * . * . * * ==See also== * :Category:John Williamson (singer) albums * :Category:John Williamson (singer) songs ==NotesReferencesJohn Williamson music video sample * Picture (716 x 757 pixels) of John Williamson * Audio interview with Williamson on Australian rugby Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century Australian singers Category:20th-century guitarists Category:21st-century Australian singers Category:21st-century guitarists Category:ARIA Award winners Category:ARIA Hall of Fame inductees Category:Australian country singer-songwriters Category:Australian country singers Category:Australian male singers Category:Australian multi- instrumentalists Category:Members of the Order of Australia Category:Musicians from Victoria (Australia) Category:People educated at Scotch College, Melbourne Category:People from Kerang Category:20th-century male singers Category:21st-century male singers Category:Australian male singer-songwriters ","title":"John Williamson (singer)"},{"id":"2205047","text":"Phillip Aspinall (born 17 December 1959) is an Australian Anglican bishop.

Most species are found in the tropical Indo-Pacific region, but there are also species in subtropical and temperate regions, warmer parts of the Americas and near the Atlantic coast in Africa. While many eleotrids pass through a planktonic stage in the sea and some spend their entire lives in the sea; as adults, the majority live in freshwater streams and brackish water. One of its genera, Caecieleotris, is troglobitic. They are especially important as predators in the freshwater stream ecosystems on oceanic islands such as New Zealand and Hawaii that otherwise lack the predatory fish families typical of nearby continents, such as catfish. Anatomically, they are similar to the gobies (Gobiidae), though unlike the majority of gobies, they do not have a pelvic sucker.Helfman, G.S., Collette, B.B. & Facey, D.E. (1997): The Diversity of Fishes. Wiley-Blackwell Publishing. p. 264. Like the true gobies, they are generally small fish that live on the substrate, often amongst vegetation, in burrows, or in crevices within rocks and coral reefs. Although goby-like in many ways, sleeper gobies lack the pelvic fin sucker and that, together with other morphological differences, is used to distinguish the two families. The Gobiidae and Eleotridae likely share a common ancestor and they are both placed in the order Gobiiformes, along with a few other small families containing goby-like fishes. Dormitator and Eleotris, two of the most widespread and typical genera, include a variety of species that inhabit marine, estuarine and freshwater habitats. Among the largest members of the family are predatory species such as the bigmouth sleeper (Gobiomorus dormitor) at up to from freshwater near the West Atlantic region and the fat sleeper (Dormitator maculatus), which grows to and is widely found in fresh to brackish and shallow marine waters of the southeastern United States and Mexico,Hoedeman, J.J. (1974): Naturalists' guide to fresh-water aquarium fish. Sterling Publishing. p. 1152. However, most are much smaller, such as the fresh- and brackish-water species from Australia and New Guinea, including Hypseleotris, known locally as gudgeons (not to be confused with the Eurasian freshwater cyprinid Gobio gobio, also known as the gudgeon and after which the Australian sleeper gobies were likely named).Riehl, R. & Baensch, H.A. (1997): Aquarium Atlas (Volume 2). Voyageur Press. p. 1216. A few of these, such as the empire gudgeon (H. compressa) and peacock gudgeon (Tateurndina ocellicauda), are sometimes kept in aquariums. The smallest in the family are the Amazonian Leptophilypnion with a standard length of less than . ==Taxonomy== Eleotris oxycephala Ratsirakia legendrei Tateurndina ocellicauda The family has been divided into three subfamilies: Butinae, Eleotrinae and Milyeringinae. However, because of the deep divergence between the three, some authorities have recommended splitting them into separate families: Butidae, Eleotridae and Milyeringidae.Thacker, C. (2011). Systematics of Butidae and Eleotridae. in Patzner, R.; J.L. Van Tassell; and M. Kovacic. The Biology of Gobies. Verlag Science Publishers.

It was alternately sponsored by Swanson and Johnson Wax for the majority of its run. It was also sponsored by the Bendix home appliance division of Avco early in its run, and Clorets and Chicken of the Sea tuna midway through its run. The show's second run sponsor, Ralston Purina, also sponsored Ethel and Albert, the program that replaced The Name's the Same on the ABC schedule. ==Moderators== Robert Q. Lewis was the original host and moderator from December 5, 1951 to August 31, 1954. During three separate personal vacation breaks, in 1953 and 1954, Conrad Nagel, Brian Aherne and Clifton Fadiman substituted for Lewis. After Lewis' final show, where he implied the show's future was in doubt, The Name's the Same went on hiatus, giving Lewis more time to devote to his daytime variety shows on CBS which Swanson decided to sponsor in place of this show. (Announcer Lee Vines continued with Lewis on CBS.) The Name's the Same returned on October 25 with a new set and Ralston Purina joined as the sponsor. During this 39-week run the moderators changed thrice. Dennis James hosted for 18 weeks, through April 4; Bob and Ray shared the moderators duties for 10 weeks, from April 11 to June 21; Clifton Fadiman returned to the emcee's chair on June 28, hosting for 11 weeks through the final episode on October 7. ==Panelists== The only panelist to remain for the shows entire run was New York-based actress and socialite Joan Alexander. The original two co- panelists with Alexander were comic Abe Burrows and composer Meredith Willson. Burrows left the show in November 1952, a victim of the Red Scare and comedian Jerry Lester took his seat, followed by comedian Carl Reiner on April 14, 1953. Willson stayed on until July 1953, and his place on the panel was taken by ABC sportscaster Bill Stern. On September 15, 1953, Reiner left and Alexander and Stern were joined by New York radio personality Gene Rayburn. On February 9, 1954, the panels makeup was adjusted and Bess Myerson, Miss America 1945, was added to the panel to replace Bill Stern and a fourth panelist was added to the game. That fourth panelist was originally Sherlock Holmes portrayer Basil Rathbone, but he left on April 6 and was replaced by Texaco Star Theater regular Arnold Stang. Stang then left on May 18 and was replaced by humorist Roger Price, who stayed on until the final episode. In January 1955, Rayburn and Meyerson left the panel and were replaced by The Jackie Gleason Show's Audrey Meadows and New York Herald Tribune columnist and future To Tell The Truth regular Hy Gardner. Gardner was replaced by actor Walter Slezak in March 1955, who in turn left in July due to a time slot switch. Mike Wallace, then a fledgling journalist, took over as the last permanent panelist. Many familiar faces of the era were guest panelists, including Bill Cullen, Morey Amsterdam, Dane Clark and Hans Conried and Cliff Norton. ==Game play== Each standard round featured a contestant who had a \\"famous name\\": the contestants full name was the same as either an actual person (\\"Jane Russell,\\" \\"Abraham Lincoln,\\" \\"Napoleon Bonaparte\\"), a place (\\"Virginia Beach,\\" \\"Monte Carlo\\"), a thing (\\"A. Lap,\\" \\"A. Table,\\" \\"Ruby Lips\\", “A. Mattress”), or an action (\\"I. Draw\\", \\"Will Kiss\\"). It was always made clear that the names used on the show were authentic. The shows legal experts would check birth certificates, hospital records and other forms of verification to affirm the names authenticity. The contestant was introduced and referred to throughout the game as \\"Mr. X\\" (or \\"Mrs./Miss/Master X\\"). A small curtain was opened to the audience, showing a placard with the contestants name, along with a drawing depicting the namesake; famous people were often caricatured. The panelists were allocated 10 questions each, with the number remaining denoted in running tally on the wall behind them. The questions had to be \\"yes or no\\" questions, and were posed to the contestant as if they were the person, place, or thing their name represented with the contestant answering as their namesake. The panel could pass to save some of their questions for later on in the game. Any member of the panel who failed to identify the contestants name wrote the contestant a check for $25, meaning each contestant won either $50 if their name was guessed by a panelist, or $75 if it was not. When a fourth panelist was added in early 1954, the check amounts were decreased to $20 per panelist, making the prizes $60 for a correct guess and $80 if the panel was stumped. Many of the contestant's names lent themselves to comedy. Robert Q. Lewis would always call on Carl Reiner first when the mystery name was a thing: Reiner's innocent questions always took on funny meanings, followed by Joan Alexander straying even farther away, to the studio audiences delight. For \\"A. Harem,\\" Reiner asked, \\"Is this thing used for recreational purposes?\\" and Alexander pursued this: \\"Do fat men use this to reduce their weight?\\" Lewis would enjoy these detours as much as the audience. It was then left to Bill Stern, a veteran reporter, to zero in on the actual name with serious, shrewd questioning. Sometimes a contestant's celebrity namesake was brought out at the end of the round to surprise the contestant; other times, a celebrity was the guest without pretext. The celebrity then played a special round called \\"I'd Like To Be...\\" in which the panel tried to guess, in the same fashion as with civilians, who the celebrity would like to be if they could be anyone else. In late 1953, \\"I'd Like To Be...\\" was replaced with \\"Secret Wish\\", in which the panel attempted to guess something that the guest would secretly like to do or have happen (for example, Kirk Douglas wished to coach the Vassar lacrosse team, and Van Johnson wanted Marilyn Monroe to sit on his lap). The celebrity's winnings ($50/$75, later $60/$80) went to his or her favorite charity. A few times near the end of the run, host Clifton Fadiman would welcome the panel, then reveal the episode's guest to the studio and home audience. The curtain would pull back with the guest standing behind it in place of the usual caricature. A typical episode contained four rounds - two standard rounds, the celebrity round, and then a final standard round; some episodes would feature one less or one more standard round. At the end of each episode, each panelist would tell how much money they \\"lost\\" followed by a good-night. ==Theme== For most of the shows run, the theme for The Name's the Same was a busy string arrangement called \\"Shooting Star\\" by Sidney Torch. This was used until the program's last 11 episodes, when an instrumental version of \\"Meet Me in St. Louis, Louis\\" by Kerry Mills was used (Ralston Purina of St. Louis was the show's sponsor). ==Foreign versions== A UK version was made for radio (BBC Home Service) and TV (BBC Television) with British namesakes of famous people, buildings and things. It ran on TV from 1954 to 1955 with Bernard Braden as the original host, later replaced by Peter Martyn. A one-off revival edition was produced for BBC Four in 2005 as part of a season of programs detailing the \\"lost decade\\". ==Episode status== At least some episodes with all four regular hosts were saved as kinescope films. Most recently, the show aired in reruns on GSN at 3:30 AM ET every morning following What's My Line? in GSN's \\"Black & White Overnight\\" block. The latest run began on July 14, 2008, with an episode from August 6, 1952, and ended on December 2 with the series finale. Episodes hosted by Lewis were added to the Buzzr schedule in January 2018. Several episodes rerun by GSN are available in their original, uncut form (e.g., with commercials and uncrunched credits) in the collectors' trading circuit, as well as from \\"public-domain\\" dealers like Shokus Video. One of these is from April 25, 1955, in which famous clown Emmett Kelly fulfills his \\"Secret Wish\\" - painting co-host Ray Goulding's face like that of a clown. ==ReferencesUKGameshows.com: The Name's the Same Category:1950s American television series Category:1950s American game shows Category:1951 American television series debuts Category:1955 American television series endings Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming Category:Black-and-white American television shows Category:Panel games Category:Television series by Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions Category:Television series by Fremantle (company) Category:1950s British game shows Category:1954 British television series debuts Category:1955 British television series endings Category:BBC Television shows Category:Black-and- white British television shows ","title":"The Name's the Same"},{"id":"2205074","text":"Langs de Vecht en d'oude Rijnstroom is the provincial anthem of Utrecht, Netherlands.

He is mainly remembered for his scheme of plant strategies to survive an unfavourable season (\\"life forms\\") and his demonstration that the relative abundance of strategies in floras largely corresponded to the Earth's climatic zones. This scheme, the Raunkiær system, is still widely used today and may be seen as a precursor of modern plant strategy schemes, e.g. J. Philip Grime's CSR system. == Life == He was born on a small heathland farm, named Raunkiær, in Lyhne parish in western Jutland, Denmark. He later took his surname after it. He succeeded Eugen Warming as professor in botany at the University of Copenhagen and the director of the Copenhagen Botanical Garden, a position he held from 1912 to 1923. He was married to the author and artist Ingeborg Raunkiær (1863–1921), who accompanied him on journeys to the West Indies and the Mediterranean and made line drawings for his botanical works. They divorced in 1915, the same year as their only son Barclay Raunkiær died. Raunkiær later married the botanist Agnete Seidelin (1874–1956). Raunkiær's research axiom was that everything countable in nature should be subjected to numerical analysis, e.g. the number of male and female catkins in monecious plants and the number of male and female individuals in dioecious plants. Raunkiær also was an early student of apomixis in flowering plants and hybrid swarms. In addition, he studied the effect of soil pH on plants and plants on soil pH, a work his apprentice Carsten Olsen continued. After his retirement, C. Raunkiær made numerical studies of plants and flora in the literature (\\"The flora and the heathland poets\\", \\"The dandelion in Danish poetry\\", \\"Plants in the psalms\\"). In these studies, he applied strict quantitative criteria, like in his ecological studies. For example, he defined a poet as a person who has written 1,000 or more lines of verse. ==Life form spectra== Raunkiær devised a system for categorising plants by life-form as a way of ecologically meaningful comparison of species and vegetation in regions having different floras. Raunkiær compared statistically local life form spectra (relative abundance) with the world average, which he called \\"the normal spectrum\\" (Raunkiær 1918 – see below). Thereby, he devised the first null model in the history of ecology. Raunkiær was a keen naturalist, who described the flora and funga of Denmark, the Virgin Islands, Tunisia, and other countries. In contrast to many contemporary naturalist, however, he strongly promoted quantitative and numerical approaches and experimentation. He devised a method to quantify the abundance of plants in vegetation as frequency in subplots and used it for quantitative studies of a range of plant communities. ==Raunkiær's law== When plotting the number of species in a plant community that fell in each 20-percentile frequency class from very frequent, i.e. numerically dominant, to very infrequent, Raunkiær discovered that most species were either very common or very rare. This came to be known as \\"Raunkiær's law\\" and is related to R. A. Fisher's logseries distribution and to Frank W. Preston's lognormal distribution of the number of individuals of each species in a community. The significance of his idea was, however, disputed already by some of his contemporaries. ==Leaf size in plant geography== As a further experiment in characterizing plant communities, Raunkiaer devised a numerical scheme based on leaf size classes and leaf type (simple or compound) that was extended by L. J. Webb and is used as a way to classify forest types more simply than by lists of component species. Raunkiær in 1896 === Popular References === Farley Mowat, in his book, Never Cry Wolf, described using a Raunkiær's Circle in making a “cover degree” study to determine the ratios of various plants one to the other. He spoke of it as \\"a device designed in hell.\\" ==Scientific publications== * Raunkiær, C. (1887) Frøskallens Bygning og Udviklingshistorie hos Geraniaceerne.

The original version of the magazine, Première, was established in France in 1976 and continues to be published there. ==History== The French film magazine Première was launched in November 1976 by Jean-Pierre Frimbois and Marc Esposito and originally published by the Lagardère Group. From 2016, it has been published by Hildegarde. The U.S. version of the magazine was launched in the United States with a July/August 1987 edition featuring Dan Aykroyd and Tom Hanks from Dragnet (1987) on the front cover. Their mission was to \\"reflect The Second Golden Age of the Movies\\". The magazine originally had offices in New York City and Los Angeles and was published by Rupert Murdoch. The founding editor was Susan Lyne. Among those working for the magazine was Peter Biskind, who spent a decade at the magazine as executive editor, later writing the film history Easy Riders, Raging Bulls. He said that, early on, the magazine \\"gave us a lot of freedom to do hard-hitting, in-depth reporting.\\" Critic Glenn Kenny joined the staff in June 1996,\\"Interview with Glenn Kenny,\\" rockcriticsarchives.com, accessed February 19, 2017. and served as a critic and later as senior editor until it ceased publication. News Corporation sold the magazine to K-III (later Primedia) in 1991, and Hachette reacquired the magazine in 1995. After Lyne left the magazine, Chris Connelly became editor- in-chief in early 1996, while Nancy Griffin served as deputy editor. Both editors resigned suddenly in May of the same year after publisher Hachette Filipacchi's then president and chief executive, David Pecker, told Connelly to not publish a column about Planet Hollywood because of its ties to billionaire Revlon owner Ronald Perelman, who was also half-owner of Premiere. James B. Meigs was listed as the editor-in-chief from the August 1996 issue. Premiere's editor, Peter Herbst, was appointed senior vice president and group editorial director for Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. in 2002. From 1995 to 2000, Herbst was editor-in-chief of Family Life magazine. ===Cancellation=== On March 5, 2007, publisher Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. announced that it was shutting down the U.S. print edition of Premiere and that the magazine would survive as an online-only publication. The last published issue was released in April 2007 and featured Blades of Glory star Will Ferrell on its cover. The final issue gave readers no warning that it would be the last. In late April, subscribers were mailed postcards advising them of the magazine's demise and telling them the balance of their subscriptions would be fulfilled with issues of the tabloid gossip magazine Us Weekly. Unhappy subscribers responded to the offer by posting negative comments on the magazine website's forum pages, and it was later announced that a cash refund would be made available for those who preferred one. The online version only lasted for a few years, as the magazine's subscribers showed little interest in its new incarnation, and the magazine ceased all operations in 2010. ===Other international editions=== Japan A Japanese edition was launched in 1990, published by Kadokawa Shoten. UK In September 1992, a UK edition was released, published by Emap Metro and edited by Barry McIlheney. The February 1998 U.S. edition published in the United Kingdom incorporated a special UK film section. By the October 1998 edition, this was published as a separate supplement but had ceased by January 1999. Other editions Print editions in other countries such as France, Poland and Spain were unaffected by the announcement of the cancellation of the U.S. edition. The Portuguese edition was canceled in October 2007. The last issue of the Czech edition was released in June 2009. ==Regular features== The U.S. edition of Premiere was released ten times a year, with issues dated February, March, April, May, June, July/August, September, October, November, and December/January. It sold all over the United States, Canada, Australia, Britain, and France. Each issue of the U.S. edition of Premiere included regular features, such as: * The Backstory - An introduction by Editor-in- Chief, Peter Herbst. * Letter Box - Letters from readers, which also often included letters from industry insiders. * Take One - A series of short features that include: ** Action - Behind the Scenes & Ahead of the Curve ** Ask Glenn - Questions posed to film critic Glenn Kenny ** Scene Stealer - A brief look at three performances from a random actor-of-the-month's career ** YES, It's True - News You're Not Supposed to Know - Tidbits on Hollywood wheeling and dealing ** First Look - Dispatches from the Moviemaking Front - Brief visits to films still in production ** The Slate - Who's Doing What, And With Whom - A quick roundup of greenlit projects ** David Strick's Hollywood - A candid black-and-white shot from a film set or location ** Previews - The Movies That Matter This Month - Synopsis and bottom line prediction ** Reviews - Film analysis and opinion from Glenn Kenny * If You Ask Me - A satirical look at Hollywood movies and moviemaking by Libby Gelman-Waxner (Nom de plume of Paul Rudnick), and illustrated by Robert de Michiell. The column offered comical comments on current movies by way of anecdotes about Libby, her Jewish mother Sondra, her gay male friend Andrew, her orthodontist husband Josh, and their \\"adorable\\" kids (including teen daughter Jennifer). * The Awful Truth - a gossip column by Ted Casablanca that ran until 1996 * Flavor of the Month - Spotlight on \\"Hot\\" Screenwriters * Home Guide ** Video/DVD reviews ** Movies We Love - Classics, forgotten treasures and just other movies just out on DVD ** DVD Essential Filmography - Covering the best of a random artist's career on the digital versatile disc format ** DVD Legacy - What great filmmakers leave behind ** TechKnowledge - Information on home cinema equipment ** Idol Chatter - A quick question-and-answer session with actors and actresses by Brantley Bardin ** Classic Scene - a transcript from a notable film scene * Filmographies - a focus on filmmakers and actors including their filmographies. === Annual features === * The Power List - Each year (typically in the May or June issue), Premiere published its list of Hollywood's most powerful people. The list typically contained prominent actors, directors, producers, agents, and lawyers. * Women in Hollywood - Each year, the magazine's October issue celebrated some of the most prominent women in Hollywood. Actresses are typically the focus, although the magazine also covered female studio executives and others in non-acting industry professions. A corresponding reception was held in Los Angeles. * Academy Awards Coverage - Each year the magazine would cover the Oscars very extensively. A book came out of its coverage written by Steve Pond titled The Big Show. ==ReferencesExternal links== * Official site (French) * The Site of Movie Magazines Covers for all 230+ issues.

Designated a National Monument on January 17, 2001, and managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, it consists of only , making it one of the smallest National Monuments in the U.S. It was previously designated a National Historic Landmark on July 25, 1965. The new Pompeys Pillar Interpretive Center opened in 2006. Exhibits in the 5,700-square foot center relate the journey of Captain William Clark and his detachment, including Sacagawea and her son Pomp, down the Yellowstone River Valley in 1806. The pillar itself stands 150 feet (45 m) above the Yellowstone River and consists of sandstone from the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation, 75 – 66 million years ago. The base of the pillar is approximately . The pillar features an abundance of Native American petroglyphs, as well as the signature of William Clark, co-leader of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Clark's inscription is the only remaining physical evidence found along the route that was followed by the expedition. The inscription consists of his signature and the date, July 25, 1806. Clark wrote that he climbed the sandstone pillar and \\"had a most extensive view in every direction on the Northerly Side of the river\\". He named the outcropping after Jean Baptiste Charbonneau—the son of expedition member Sacagawea—whom he nicknamed \\"Pompy\\". His original name for it was \\"Pompys Tower\\"; it was changed to the current title in 1814. Situated 25 miles (40 km) northeast of Billings, Montana, along Interstate 94, the pillar gets 50,000 visitors annually. Archeological evidence suggests that the outcropping has been witness to 11,000 years of human involvement in the area. Consequently, in addition to the pictographs and the signature of William Clark, hundreds of other people have carved their initials into the rock, including early pioneers to the area.

Significant as the site of the Battle of Pratapgad, the fort is now a popular tourist destination.Pratapgad Fort:https://www.india.com/travel/articles/pratapgad-fort-a-must-visit-on-a- day-trip-from-mahabaleshwar-3702157/Off beat destinations in Maharashtra: https://www.outlookindia.com/outlooktraveller/explore/story/69772/offbeat- destinations-in-maharashtra ==Geography== Pratapgad fort is located from Poladpur and west of Mahabaleshwar, a popular hill station in the area. The fort stands above sea level and is built on a spur which overlooks the road between the villages of Par and Kinesvar. ==History== The Maratha king Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj commissioned Moropant Trimbak Pingle, his prime minister, to undertake the construction of this fort in order to defend the banks of the Nira and the Koyna rivers, and to defend the Par pass. It was completed in 1656. The Battle of Pratapgad between Chatrapti Shivaji Maharaj and Afzal Khan was fought below the ramparts of this fort on 10 November 1659. This was the first major test of the fledgling kingdom's army, and set the stage of the establishment of the Maratha empire. Pratapgad continued to be involved in regional politics. Sakharam Bapu, a well-known minister of Pune, was confined by his rival Nana Phadnis in Pratapgad in 1778. He was later moved from fort to fort until he died at Raigad. In 1796, Nana Phadnis, while escaping from the intrigues of Daulatrao Shinde and his minister Baloba, assembled a strong garrison in Pratapgad before heading to Mahad. In 1818, as part of the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Pratapgad surrendered by private negotiation. This was a great loss to the Maratha forces, as Pratapgad was an important stronghold, had a large garrison, and could suppress much of the country around Wai. A 17 feet high equestrian bronze statue of Shivaji was unveiled by Jawaharlal Nehru, then Prime Minister of India, on 30 November 1957, the same year a road was constructed by the Public Works Department from Kumbhrosi village up to fort. A guest house and a national park were built inside the fort in 1960. The fort is currently owned by Udayanraje Bhosale, the heir to the former Satara princely state. ==Structure== The fort can be divided into the lower fort and upper fort. The upper fort was built upon the crest of the hill. It is roughly square, 180m long on each side. It has several permanent buildings, including a temple to the god Mahadev. It is located at the northwest of the fort, and is surrounded by sheer cliffs with drops of up to 250m. The lower fort is around 320m long and 110m wide. It is located at the southeast of the fort, and is defended by towers and bastions ten to twelve metres high. The Afzal tower extends out from the fort proper and defends the approach to the fort. It is said to have been constructed after the Battle of Pratapgad, and Afzal Khan's body is said to be buried under the tower. In 1661, Shivaji Maharaj was unable to visit the temple of the goddess Bhavani at Tuljapur. He decided to dedicate a temple to the goddess at this fort itself. This temple is on the eastern side of the lower fort. The hall has been rebuilt since the original construction, and consists of wooden pillars about 50' long, 30' broad and 12' high. The shrine is made of stone, and contains a clothed black stone image of the goddess. The roof of the temple is flat inside, but covered in lead covering put up by the Satara Raja Pratapsinha (1818–1839). A small spire or shikhar covers the shrine.The temple also has the sword of Maratha General Hambirao Mohite adorned with 6 diamond stones signifying that he had killed 600 soldiers in the battle. There is also a spatikha linga being worshipped inside the temple.The armors used in the battle during that period by the infantry soldiers are also on display just outside the temple A dargah of Afzal Khan is located a short while away from the fort to the south-east. ==Tourism== Pratapgad is usually visited as a day-trip from the hill station of Mahabaleshwar, a popular tourist destination located 25 kilometres away. ST bus service have run daily excursion services to places around Mahabaleshwar including Pratapgad for decades. Many schools also arrange educational trips to the fort. The fort is also on many trekking routes of the area. ==See also== *List of forts in Maharashtra *List of forts in Mumbai *List of forts in India *List of forts ==References== Category:Forts in Satara district Category:Mahabaleshwar Category:1656 establishments in India ","title":"Pratapgad"},{"id":"2205116","text":"Abantidas (in Greek Ἀβαντίδας), the son of Paseas, became tyrant of the ancient Greek city-state of Sicyon in 264 BC after murdering Cleinias, the father of Aratus. After the assassination, Abantidas had the remaining friends and relations of Cleinias banished or put to death. Aratus, the son of Cleinias, who was then only seven years old, narrowly escaped death by fleeing into the house of Soso, Abantidas' sister, who happened to be married to Prophantus, the late Cleinias' brother. She hid him in the house, and at night sent him secretly off to Argos. Abantidas was fond of literature, and was accustomed to attending the philosophical discussions of Deinias of Argos and Aristotle, the dialectician, in the agora of Sicyon. During one of these occasions in 252 BC, with the complicity of the two rhetors, he was murdered by his enemies. After his death, his father, Paseas succeeded him as tyrant.

The Desperate Bicycles pioneered the do-it-yourself ethic of punk, adopting a proselytising role exemplified by their ardent exhortation: \\"it was easy, it was cheap – go and do it!\\". The group have been described as \\"DIY's most fervent evangelists\\". ==History== The Desperate Bicycles formed in March 1977 \\"specifically for the purpose of recording and releasing a single on their own label\\".Liner-notes, \\"The Medium was Tedium\\" single, June 1977. The band initially consisted of Nicky Stephens (keyboards), Roger Stephens (bass), Danny Wigley (vocals), Mel Oxer, (drums) and Paul LeClerc (guitar).‘Desperate Bicycles’ (article) by Graham Lock, New Musical Express, 14 October 1978. The band's name derives from a passage in J. B. Priestley’s 1930 novel Angel Pavement: In October 1978 vocalist Danny Wigley expressed the motivation driving the Desperate Bicycles' independent stance: \\"The biggest hurdle is just believing you’ve still got some control over your life, that you can go out and do it\\". Vocalist Dan Wigley stands at 6 feet 8 inches tall. Making him the tallest member of any punk band until the 6'10\\" Tobin Balwinkel formed Flatfoot 56 in 2000. ===First single=== In March 1977 the Desperate Bicycles booked a studio at Dalston in East London to record their first single. The band possessed only an amp and a bass-guitar and the studio supplied the other instruments and equipment; \\"with a lot of courage and a little rehearsal\\" they recorded two songs, \\"Smokescreen\\" and \\"Handlebars\\". The first record was released in August 1977 as an edition of 500 pressings on the band’s own Refill Records label. The records cost £153 to produce, which comprised the three hours studio time, the price of pressing and the sleeves. The record was unusual in that it featured the same tracks on both sides and was a mono recording. The song \\"Handlebars\\" ends with the Desperate Bicycles' strident DIY rallying cry \\"it was easy, it was cheap - go and do it!\\". Roger Stephens and Danny Wrigley hawked the \\"Smokescreen\\" single around the small independent record shops, and distributors such as Virgin and Rough Trade. The first pressing sold out within four months resulting in a profit to the band of £210. Using this money a second pressing of 1,000 was made, which sold out in a fortnight. The profit from that was used to finance the pressings of the Desperate Bicycles' second single. ===Second single=== The drummer and guitarist had left the band soon after the recording of the \\"Smokescreen\\" single, with the drummer being replaced by Dave Papworth, then aged 14 years. The new line-up went back to the studio in June 1977 and recorded another two songs, \\"The Medium was Tedium\\" and \\"Don't Back the Front\\". The second single was released in February 1978 in a pressing of 1,000 and sold out in a week. \\"The Medium was Tedium\\" incorporates \\"it was easy, it was cheap - go and do it!\\" as a refrain, urging others to follow the band’s example. \\"Don't Back the Front\\" contains the lines: \\"cut it, press it, distribute it / Xerox music's here at last\\". For the Desperate Bicycles 'do-it-yourself' \\"meant the overthrow of the establishment music industry through people seizing the means of production, making their own entertainment, and selling it to other creative and autonomous spirits\\".Simon Reynolds (2005), Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984, Penguin Books, , pp. 30-31 With the profit from their second single the group pressed a further 2,500 copies of each of their singles, and also purchased some more equipment. ===Early gigs and subsequent recordings=== In the second half of 1977, with a single in the market-place, the Desperate Bicycles were invited to perform at Eric's Club in Liverpool. The band were unprepared for a live gig – \\"Our first purpose was just to make and sell records\\". But with characteristic enthusiasm and persistence they re- learnt the songs they had recorded and wrote a batch of new ones. They set up a rehearsal room at 106 Erlanger Rd, New Cross in South London in order to practice the new material. This was in the basement and sound proofed with cardboard eggboxes. On New Year’s Eve 1977 the Desperate Bicycles hired a van and drove to Liverpool for their first gig at Eric’s Club. The New Cross, New Cross EP, consisting of six of the additional songs they had written, was released in May 1978. The Desperate Bicycles performed sporadically in 1978, including a Rock Against Racism benefit with Sham 69. In July that year they released another single. By October 1979 Roger Stephens and Dave Papworth were replaced by Dan 'Electro'/Driscoll (guitar) and Geoff Titley (drums), with Nicky Stephens taking up the bass-guitar.'The Desperate Bicycles', 26 October 1979 interview by Nag, Bendle and Igor, Common Knowledge No. 1 (late 1979 or early 1980), available online (accessed 17 April 2009); see also ‘PUNKNET 77 - Desperate Bicycles’, Hiljaiset Levyt web-site , (accessed 4 March 2009). The Remorse Code album was released in February 1980, reaching number 10 on the UK Indie Chart. The Desperate Bicycles disbanded in 1981. Danny Wigley and Jeff Titley, with Dennis Burns and Cameron Allan, recorded (as?) Lusty Ghosts on the Refill label.‘U.K. \\"D.I.Y.\\" & DIY-punk 1978-‘84, ‘Messthetics’ web-site (accessed 6 March 2009). Is Lusty Ghosts a band or an album title? ===Music and legacy=== The music of the Desperate Bicycles has been described as: \\"Spindly, fuzzy, guttural guitars through puny amplifiers, reedy, wheezy organs, out of tune electric pianos, cardboard box drums and monotonous declamatory yet somehow utterly reasonable sounding vocals\\".‘No More Time for Speculating’, by Richard Mason, November 1999, Perfect Sound Forever (on-line music magazine) (accessed 4 March 2009). Another reviewer described them as \\"a shambling wreck of a psychedelic post-punk band\\". (Note the differently- spelled name) The writer Simon Reynolds states that the group's music \\"was almost puritan in its unadorned simplicity, its guitar sound frugal to the point of emaciation\\". > For the Desperate Bicycles, it was as though sloppiness and scrawniness > became signs of membership in the true punk elect. The very deficiency of > traditional rock virtues (tightness, feel) stood as tokens of the group's > authenticity and purity of intent. The Desperate Bicycles were a group of amateur musicians who remained determinedly independent. Their enjoyment of the creative and technical processes of making music is revealed in their recordings. The example they set, their energy and enthusiasm and the simple message of \\"go and do it!\\", inspired a generation of punk and post-punk bands to follow in their footsteps, in both the UK and further afield.As examples, see (1) influence on Scritti Politti, ‘No More Time for Speculating’, by Richard Mason, November 1999; (2) in Australia the Thought Criminals attribute the Desperate Bicycles as an inspirational example (see The Thought Criminals Official Site 'BIO Dynamic'). In the years since their dissolution, the bandmembers have remained true to their principles, declining offers for interviews and having their music re-issued. ==Discography== * Smokescreen 7\\" single (Refill Records RR-1; August 1977) - \\"Smokescreen\\" / \\"Handlebars\\". * The Medium was Tedium 7\\" single (Refill Records RR-2; February 1978) - \\"The Medium was Tedium\\" / \\"Don't Back the Front\\". * New Cross, New Cross 7\\" EP (Refill Records RR-3; May 1978) - \\"(I Make the) Product\\" / \\"Paradise Lost\\" / \\"Advice on Arrest\\" / \\"Holidays\\" / \\"The Housewife Song\\" / \\"Cars\\". * Occupied Territory 7\\" single (Refill Records RR-4; July 1978) - \\"Occupied Territory\\" / \\"Skill\\". * John Peel session (July 1978) – \\"Smokescreen\\" / \\"Skill\\" / \\"Sarcasm\\" / \\"Teacher's Prayer\\". * Remorse Code LP (Refill Records RR-6; February 1980) – \\"I Am Nine\\" / \\"Walking the Talking Channel\\" / \\"A Can of Lemonade\\" / \\"Pretty Little Analyse\\" / \\"Acting\\" / \\"It’s Somebody’s Birthday Today\\" / \\"Sarcasm\\" / \\"Trendy Feelings\\" / \\"Natural History\\" / \\"Blasting Radio\\". * Grief is Very Private EP (Refill Records RR-7; 1980) – \\"Grief is Very Private\\" / Obstructive\\" / \\"Conundrum\\". ==ReferencesExternal links== *Cover art and mp3s * Essay on the Desperate Bicycles and Scritti Politti Category:English punk rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 1977 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1980 Category:DIY culture ","title":"The Desperate Bicycles"},{"id":"2205123","text":"The cover of The Voyage of the Poppykettle. The Voyage of the Poppykettle (later re-published as Voyage of Poppykettle) is a 1980 children's book about a group of \\"hairy Peruvians\\" setting out from Peru to discover Australia. It was written and illustrated by Robert Ingpen, who also wrote the sequel, The Unchosen Land. The story of the Poppykettle was later updated with new material by Michael Lawrence and republished as The Poppykettle Papers in 1999. The story contains reference to the Geelong Keys. == Background == In 1975, Robert Ingpen developed the story based on his work with the United Nations in Peru. As part of that work, he was researching ancient Inca fishing stories, and two elements of that research formed the kernel of the Poppykettle idea: Inca dolls and pottery; and a plaque which commemorated an expedition from the headland at Callao in the 16th century into the Pacific Ocean. Years later he wrote this children's book and its sequel based on that idea. These stories were so popular in Ingpen's home, Geelong, Victoria that a fountain and an annual Poppykettle Festival celebrate the mythical landing of the \\"hairy Peruvians\\". Ingpen won the 1986 Hans Christian Andersen Award for illustration for this book. ==References== Category:1980 children's books Category:Australian picture books Category:Australian children's books Category:Pre-1606 contact with Australia ","title":"The Voyage of the Poppykettle"},{"id":"2205132","text":"Air Vice Marshal Sir Leonard Monk Isitt (27 July 1891 – 21 January 1976) was a New Zealand military aviator and senior air force commander. In 1943 he became the first New Zealander to serve as the Chief of the Air Staff of the Royal New Zealand Air Force, a post he held until 1946. At the close of World War II, Isitt was the New Zealand signatory to the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. After the war, following retirement from the Air Force, he worked as chairman of Tasman Empire Airways. ==Early life== Leonard Monk Isitt was born on 27 July 1891 in Christchurch, New Zealand, the son of the Methodist minister, member of parliament and prohibitionist Leonard Monk Isitt and Agnes Martha Caverhill. Leonard Monk Isitt junior was educated at Mostyn House, Cheshire, England and Christchurch Boys' High School. He had one brother, Willard Whitmore Isitt (1894–1916), who was a Rifleman in the New Zealand Rifle Brigade in World War I and was killed in France on 31 October 1916. ==World War I and air force service== Following the outbreak of World War I he enlisted in April 1915 in the New Zealand Army and was assigned to the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. After service in Egypt he then moved to the Western Front where he was wounded in the head during the New Zealand Division's participation in the Battle of Flers–Courcelette. The scalp wound resulted in him being sent to England to recover, where he was discharged from the NZEF in March 1917.Classen, page 96. On 10 May 1917 he was granted a probationary commission in the Royal Flying Corps as a second lieutenant, which was confirmed a month later. He was assigned as a pilot to a reconnaissance squadron with most of his duties involving artillery cooperation. During his period he shot down a single enemy aircraft, before being transferred back to England to serve as a flying instructor. After volunteering for frontline service he was assigned to 98 squadron in October 1917, flying the DH.9 on bombing missions. Based at Abscon airfield he flew his first mission on 9 October when 10 aircraft attacked Mons railway station. During the raid they were attacked by 15 Fokkers and Pfalzes. Two other major raids followed on 14 and 23 October. The later raid, was on the Hirson railway station, which saw two aircraft of the squadron shot down.Classen, page 409. In addition to these bombing flights he was also undertaking aerial reconnaissance. In 1918 he was transferred to the Royal Air Force.Officers of the NZPAF ==Inter-war years== At the close of World War I, New Zealand had no military air organisation of any sort. On the request of the New Zealand government, the British Air Ministry sent Colonel (later Group Captain) A. V. Bettington to New Zealand to advise on the establishment of an air service. Bettington brought four aircraft with him and they were based at Sockburn airfield (later to become RNZAF Station Wigram). It was to this embryonic state of affairs that Isitt was to return. In 1919 Isitt, then a captain, was posted back to New Zealand where he was sent to Sockburn airfield to take care of the four aircraft and serve as commanding officer. Additionally Isitt served as the liaison officer to the Canterbury Aviation Company on behalf of the government. Between the wars, one of Isitt's responsibilities was pilot flight training and he served in the Air Ministry, the New Zealand Permanent Air Force (NZPAF) and the RNZAF. In 1937, the RNZAF was made independent of the New Zealand Army and at that time Isitt was promoted to wing commander and appointed as the Air Member for Personnel. In the pre-World War II build up this was a key post and Isitt was soon promoted again to group captain. ==World War II== Tokyo Bay, Japan – Surrender of Japanese aboard USS Missouri. Air Vice Marshal Leonard M. Isitt, representing the Dominion of New Zealand, signs the instrument of surrender. Continuing as Air Member for Personnel at the start of World War II, in March 1940 Isitt went to Canada as he had been appointed as New Zealand's representative on the board of Empire Air Training Scheme, a massive aviation training programme. In May 1942 Isitt was sent to London to establish the RNZAF's Overseas Headquarters, receiving a promotion to air commodore at the same time. Having accomplished his task, under a year later Isitt was back in New Zealand and in March 1943 Isitt became the New Zealand's Deputy Chief of Air Staff working under the then Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore Victor Goddard, a British officer on secondment. Around four months later on 19 July 1943 Isitt was appointed Chief of Air Staff of the Royal New Zealand Air Force in the rank of air vice-marshal. He was the first New Zealander to hold his Service's senior appointment and the first to hold one of the air marshal ranks. In addition to securing a significant role for his Air Force in the South Pacific, Isitt represented New Zealand at conferences in London, Washington and Ottawa during World War II. He was the New Zealand signatory to the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on the USS Missouri marking the formal surrender of Japanese forces, so ending World War II.Photo of Isitt signing Instrument ==Post war== Isitt retired in 1946 as Chief of the Air Staff and he became chairman of Tasman Empire Airways (TEAL) in 1947. He continued as TEAL chairman until 1963 when he was succeeded by Sir Andrew McKee. Following his retirement as chairman of NAC and TEAL he served as chairman of Standard–Triumph New Zealand, Motor Assemblies Limited and then Leyland Motors of New Zealand until his final retirement in 1966. Together with Ronald Bannerman and Keith Caldwell he was instrumental in establishing the New Zealand 1914–1918 Airmen's Association in 1960.Classen, p. 425. He died at Lower Hutt on 21 January 1976. ==Personal life== Isitt married Elsie Gladys Caverhill (1896–1970) at Wellington on 26 April 1920. They had two daughters. ==Honours== In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1940 and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1946 New Year Honours. His medals are held at the Air Force Museum of New Zealand. ==NotesReferences== * ==External links== *Crooks, David M. Isitt, Leonard Monk 1891–1976.

Raunkiær and later extended by various authors. Life forms ==History== It was first proposed in a talk to the Danish Botanical Society in 1904 as can be inferred from the printed discussion of that talk, but not the talk itself, nor its title. The journal, Botanisk Tidsskrift, published brief comments on the talk by M.P. Porsild, with replies by Raunkiær. A fuller account appeared in French the following year.Raunkiær, C. (1905) Types biologiques pour la géographie botanique. Oversigt over Det Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskabs Forhandlinger, 1905, 347-438. Raunkiær elaborated further on the system and published this in Danish in 1907.Raunkiær, C. (1907) Planterigets Livsformer og deres Betydning for Geografien. Gyldendalske Boghandel - Nordisk Forlag, København and Kristiania. 132 pp., (PDF).Ch. 2 in Raunkiær (1934): The life-forms of plants and their bearings on geography, p. 2-104. The original note and the 1907 paper were much later translated to English and published with Raunkiær's collected works.Ch. 1 in Raunkiær (1934): Biological types with reference to the adaption of plants to survive the unfavourable season, p. 1.Raunkiær, C.

Note: These are not all of Raunkiær's publications, only those on plant form and geography. ==Modernization== Raunkiær's life-form scheme has subsequently been revised and modified by various authors,Ellenberg. H. & D. Mueller-Dombois (1967). A key to Raunkiær plant life-forms with revised subdivisions. Ber. Goebot. Inst. ETH. Stiftg Rubel. Zurich. 37:56-73, .Müller-Dombois, D. & H.

Sidgwick & Jackson, London. but the main structure has survived. Raunkiær's life-form system may be useful in researching the transformations of biotas and the genesis of some groups of phytophagous animals. ==Subdivisions== The subdivisions of the Raunkiær system are premised on the location of the bud of a plant during seasons with adverse conditions, i. e. cold seasons and dry seasons: ===Phanerophytes=== These plants, normally woody perennials, grow stems into the air, with their resting buds being more than 50 cm above the soil surface, e.g. trees and shrubs, and also epiphytes, which Raunkiær later separated as a distinct class (see below). Raunkiær further divided the phanerophytes according to height as *Megaphanerophytes, *Mesophanerophytes, *Microphanerophytes, and *Nanophanerophytes. Further division was premised on the characters of duration of foliage, i. e. evergreen or deciduous, and presence of covering bracts on buds, for 8 classes. 3 further divisions were made to increase the total of classes to 12: *Phanerophytic stem succulents, *Phanerophytic epiphytes, and *Phanerophytic herbs. ===Epiphytes=== Epiphytes were originally included in the phanerophytes (see above) but then separated because they do not grow in soil, so the soil location is irrelevant in classifying them. ===Chamaephytes=== These plants have buds on persistent shoots near the soil surface; woody plants with perennating buds borne close to the soil surface, a maximum of 25 cm above the soil surface, e.g., bilberry and periwinkle. ===Hemicryptophytes=== Hemicryptophytes These plants have buds at or near the soil surface, e.g. common daisy and dandelion, and are divided into: *Protohemicryptophytes: only cauline foliage; *Partial rosette plants: both cauline and basal rosette foliage; and *Rosette plants: only basal rosette foliage. ===Cryptophytes=== A cryptophyte geophyte These plants have subterranean or under water resting buds, and are divided into: *Geophytes: rest in dry soil as a rhizome, bulb, corm, et cetera, e.g. crocus and tulip, and are subdivided into: **Rhizome geophytes, **Stem-tuber geophytes, **Root- tuber geophytes, **Bulb geophytes, and **Root geophytes. *Helophytes: rest in marshy or wet soil, e.g. reedmace and marsh-marigold; and *Hydrophytes: rest submerged under water, e.g. water lily and frogbit. ===Therophytes=== These are annual plants that complete their lives rapidly in favorable conditions and survive the unfavorable cold or dry season in the form of seeds. Many desert plants are by necessity therophytes. ===Aerophytes=== Tillandsia landbeckii, an aerophyte Aerophytes were a later addition to the system.Galán de Mera, A., M. A. Hagen and J. A. Vicente Orellana (1999) Aerophyte, a New Life Form in Raunkiær's Classification? Journal of Vegetation Science 10 (1): 65-68 These are plants that obtain moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. They usually grow on other plants yet are not parasitic on them. These are perennial plants whose roots atrophy. Some can live on mobile sand dunes. Like epiphytes and hemicryptophytes, their buds are near the soil surface. Some Tillandsia species are classified as aerophytes. ===Popular References=== Farley Mowat, in his book, Never Cry Wolf, described using a Raunkiær's Circle in making a “cover degree” study to determine the ratios of various plants one to the other.

A. K. Pataudi (16 March 1910 – 5 January 1952) was the 8th Nawab of Pataudi and the captain of the India national cricket team for the tour to England in 1946. His son Mansoor, known as the Nawab of Pataudi Jr., also later served as captain of the India cricket team. He also played Test cricket for the England team in 1932 and 1934, making him one of the few cricketers to have played Test cricket for two countries and the only Test cricketer to have played for both India and England. He played in six Tests in all, three as captain of India and three for England. ==Personal lifeEarly life and family=== Iftikhar Ali Khan was born at Pataudi House in Delhi, into the family of the Nawabs of Pataudi, a small () non-salute princely state near Delhi, located in the present-day Indian state of Haryana. The Pataudi family traces their origin to Faiz Talab Khan, an ethnic Pashtun from the Barech tribe of Kandahar, Afghanistan, who became the first Nawab of the Pataudi State in 1804.The Hindu, Sunday, 3 Aug 2003 - Royal vignettes: Pataudi: The Afghan connection Iftikhar Ali Khan was the elder son of Nawab Muhammad Ibrahim Ali Khan of Pataudi and his wife Shahar Bano Begum, daughter of Amiruddin Ahmad Khan, the Nawab of Loharu. Thus he was related to great Urdu poet Mirza Ghalib as well as later day Pakistan prime minister, Liaqat Ali Khan. He became Nawab on his father's death in 1917 and was formally installed as ruler in December 1931. His state became part of the newly independent India in 1948. After Indian independence, he was employed in the Indian Foreign Office till the time of his death. ===Education=== Educated at Chiefs' College (later renamed Aitchison College), Lahore, and at Balliol College, Oxford, Iftikhar married Begum Sajida Sultan, second daughter of Hamidullah Khan, last ruling Nawab of Bhopal, in 1939. Hamidullah Khan was to have been succeeded in the titles and privileges associated with the ruling house of Bhopal by his eldest daughter Abida Sultan, She emigrated to Pakistan in the aftermath of the partition of India. His voluntary accession of his state to India by going to Delhi has been recounted in V P Menon's book The story of Integration of Indian States. V P Menon remembered him as \\"Great Patriot who unfortunately died young\\". Sajida therefore succeeded her father and was recognised by the government of India as Begum of Bhopal in 1961. Upon her demise in 1995, her son Mansoor succeeded to the estates and titles associated with the Nawabs of Bhopal. ==Cricketing career== Iftikhar Ali Khan was coached at school in India by Oxford cricketer M. G. Slater and then in England by Frank Woolley. He went to Oxford in 1927. It was two years before he won a blue; this was for a 106 and 84 that saved a match against Cambridge. In the 1931 season, he scored 1,307 runs for Oxford and finished with a batting average of 93, heading the Oxford averages. In the University Match that year, Alan Ratcliffe scored 201 for Cambridge, a new record. Pataudi declared that he would beat it, and hit 238* on the very next day. This stood as a record for the University Match until 2005. Pataudi qualified to play for Worcestershire in 1932 but played only three matches and scored just 65 runs in six innings. However, his slaughter of Tich Freeman with marvellous footwork during an innings of 165 for the Gentlemen at Lord's in July 1932 gained him a place on the Ashes tour for that winter. He was selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1932. ===Selection for First Test match=== He was selected for the first Test of the 1932–33 Ashes series, Pataudi followed in the footsteps of Ranjitsinhji by scoring a century (102) on his Test debut in Sydney, which England won by 10 wickets. He nonetheless incurred the ire of his captain Douglas Jardine by dissenting against Jardine's bodyline tactics. Upon Pataudi's refusal to take his place in a bodyline leg-side field, Jardine retorted, \\"I see His Highness is a conscientious objector.\\" He was dropped after the second Test in Melbourne, in which he scored 15 and 5, and did not play again that series. Towards the end of the tour, Pataudi said of Jardine: \\"I am told he has his good points. In three months I have yet to see them.\\"Williamson, Martin (25 October 2007) Rubbing almost everyone up the wrong way. Cricinfo 1933 was Pataudi's only full season of county cricket, and he batted marvellously, again slaughtering Freeman at Worcester and scoring two other double-hundreds. He finished with 1749 runs at an average of 49, but after more brilliant batting early in 1934 his health broke down and he played just ten games, although recording a batting average of 91.33. He played in his third and last Test for England in June 1934, against Australia at Trent Bridge, scoring 12 and 10. Pataudi did not play at all in 1935 and 1936 and only five times altogether in 1937 and 1938. Nonetheless, in these games he batted so well that Worcestershire, weak in batting, were always regretting he could not play more often. He has been considered as a possible captain for the India team in its first Test match in 1932, at Lord's, but withdrew his name from consideration. He was actually appointed captain for the India tour of England in 1936, but withdrew at the last moment, ostensibly on health grounds. He finally played for India when he captained the tour to England in 1946. Despite averaging 46.71 on the tour, his scored only 55 runs in 5 Test innings, and his captaincy was also criticised. He was Indian Cricketer of the Year in 1946/47. He planned a return to play for Worcestershire for the 1952 county cricket season, but died in India before he came back. Iftikhar Ali Khan was also a fine hockey and billiards player and an accomplished speaker. In 2007, in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of India's Test debut, the Marylebone Cricket Club commissioned a trophy in Pataudi's name, to be competed for in the Test series between India and England . ==Death and legacy== In addition to their son, Iftikhar and Sajida were also the parents of three daughters. Iftikhar died at Delhi with a heart attack while playing polo on 5 January 1952, also his son's eleventh birthday. His son succeeded him as the 9th Nawab of Pataudi, and later also served as captain of the Indian cricket team. Iftikhar was also the grandfather of Bollywood actors Saif Ali Khan and Soha Ali Khan. ==See also== *Nawab of Pataudi *List of cricketers who have played for more than one international team == References External links== * *Resume of cricketing career * *Genealogy of the ruling chiefs of Pataudi * Mihir Bose, ‘Khan, Muhammad Iftikhar Ali, nawab of Pataudi (1910–1952)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011 accessed 22 May 2012 * https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/603/603.html Category:English cricketers Category:England Test cricketers Category:India Test cricket captains Category:Cricketers who made a century on Test debut Category:Indian cricketers Category:India Test cricketers Category:Indian people of Pashtun descent Category:Cricketers who have played for more than one international team Category:Aitchison College alumni Category:Oxford University cricketers Category:Gentlemen cricketers Category:Worcestershire cricketers Category:Wisden Cricketers of the Year Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Southern Punjab cricketers Category:North Zone cricketers Category:Alumni of Balliol College, Oxford Category:Cricketers from Bhopal Category:1910 births Category:1952 deaths Category:English cricketers of 1919 to 1945 ","title":"Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi"},{"id":"2205160","text":"Travis John \\"Chunks\\" Friend (born 7 January 1981) is a former Zimbabwean Test and One Day International cricketer.

Stawell was the first Attorney-General of Victoria, serving from 1851 to 1856 as an appointed official sitting in the Victorian Legislative Council, and from 1856 until 1857, as an elected politician, representing Melbourne. ==Early life== Stawell was born in Old Court, County Cork, Ireland the second son of ten children of Jonas Stawell, and his wife Anna, second daughter of the Right Reverend William Foster, bishop of Clogher. Stawell was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, studied law at the King's Inns, Dublin, and at Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the Irish bar in 1839. Stawell travelled in Europe with his friends Redmond Barry and James Moore. He practised law in Ireland until 1842 when he decided to emigrate to Australia. ==Australia== Stawell was admitted to the Port Phillip District bar in 1843. He engaged extensively in pastoral pursuits, and had sheep stations at Natte Yallock, Victoria, on the banks of the Avoca River, and in the neighbourhood of Lake Wallace, near the South Australian border. When Charles Perry came to Australia as first bishop of Melbourne, Stawell helped him to form a constitution for the newly created diocese. His first cousins and fellow Anglo-Irish, the brothers William and Leopold de Salis also went to Australia in the 1840s. ==Attorney-general== For many years Stawell enjoyed the leading practice at the local bar, and when the Port Phillip district of New South Wales was separated from the parent colony, and entered upon an independent existence as the Colony of Victoria, Stawell accepted the position of Attorney-General on 15 July 1851 and became a member of the Executive Council and the Legislative Council. A few weeks after Stawell's appointment gold was discovered in Victoria; the duty of creating a system of government which could cope adequately with the situation fell to him. Stawell had to establish a police force, frame regulations for the government of the goldfields, appoint magistrates and officials of every grade, and protect life and property against the perceived threat of the hordes of gold rush adventurers who arrived in Victoria, first from the neighbouring colonies, and later from Europe and America. Much was owed to the firm administration of Stawell that, at a time when the government was weak, and many of the newcomers impatient of control, lynch law was never resorted to. Rather than export duty on gold, Stawell supported a miners' licensing system, which was one of the major grievances leading to the Eureka Rebellion in Ballarat in 1854. Referring to the miners as \\"wandering vagabonds\\" and \\"vagrants\\", Stawell was the prosecutor in the unsuccessful case against the rebel leaders charged with high treason. Stawell had very little assistance for some time from any of his colleagues, and until the Executive Council was strengthened by the admission of Captain Andrew Clarke and Hugh Culling Childers, Stawell was the brains as well as the body of the administration. The success of his policy was upon the whole remarkable. In the legislature he was sometimes opposed, and at other times assisted, by John O'Shanassy, who was the leader of the popular party, and between them they managed to pass a number of statutes which added greatly to the prosperity of the colony. A political contemporary, Henry Samuel Chapman, spoke of him as \\"almost the only efficient man connected with the government.\\" ==Constitution Act== Stawell was indefatigable in the discharge of his duties, and extraordinary stories are told of the long journeys on horseback to visit distant outposts which he would take after being all day long in the law courts or in the council chamber. Stawell bore an active part in drafting the Constitution Act which gave to Victoria representative institutions and a responsible ministry, instead of an executive appointed and removable by the governor and a legislature in which one-third of the members were chosen by the Crown. At the first general election after the new constitution in 1856 Stawell was returned as one of the Members for Melbourne, and became the attorney-general of the first responsible ministry. In 1857, on the resignation of the chief justice, Sir William à Beckett, he succeeded to the vacant post, and was created a knight bachelor. He administered the government of Victoria in 1873, 1875–1876, and 1884. ==Legacy== Stawell left Australia after his 1843 arrival only in 1872, when he paid short visits to the neighbouring colonies and New Zealand, and in 1873, when he returned to Europe on two years' leave of absence. Stawell took a very deep interest in the proceedings of the Church of England, and was a member of the synod. On his retirement from the bench in 1886, he was created . Stawell died at Naples, Italy, on 12 March 1889. The family house D'Estaville, built in 1859, still stands in the inner Melbourne suburb of Kew. The town of Stawell, Victoria was named in his honour. ==Family== In 1856 Stawell married Mary Frances Elizabeth Greene, only daughter of W.P. Greene, RN; *Richard Rawdon Stawell (1864–1935) became a doctor *eldest daughter Anna Catherine Stawell married mining magnate Sylvester J.

Gaseous fire suppression, also called clean agent fire suppression, is a term to describe the use of inert gases and chemical agents to extinguish a fire. These agents are governed by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standard for Clean Agent Fire Extinguishing Systems – NFPA 2001 in the US, with different standards and regulations elsewhere. The system typically consists of the agent, agent storage containers, agent release valves, fire detectors, fire detection system (wiring control panel, actuation signaling), agent delivery piping, and agent dispersion nozzles. Less typically, the agent may be delivered by means of solid propellant gas generators that produce either inert or chemically active gas. ==Theory== There are four means used by the agents to extinguish a fire. They act on the \\"fire tetrahedron\\": * Reduction or isolation of fuel. No agents currently use this as the primary means of fire suppression. * Reduction of heat. Representative agents: Clean agent FS 49 C2 (NAF S 227, MH227, FM-200), Novec 1230, pentafluoroethane (NAF S125, ECARO-25). * Reduction or isolation of oxygen: Representative agents: Argonite / IG-55 (ProInert), carbon dioxide, Inert Gas 541 IG-541 Inergen, and IG-100 (NN100). * Inhibiting the chain reaction of the above components. Representative agents: FE-13, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-Heptafluoropropane, FE-25, haloalkanes, bromotrifluoromethane, trifluoroiodomethane, NAF P-IV, NAF S-III, NAF S 125, NAF S 227, and Triodide (Trifluoroiodomethane). ==Application== Broadly speaking, there are two methods for applying an extinguishing agent: total flooding and local application: * Systems working on a total flooding principle apply an extinguishing agent to a three dimensional enclosed space in order to achieve a concentration of the agent (volume percent of the agent in air) adequate to extinguish the fire. These types of systems may be operated automatically by detection and related controls or manually by the operation of a system actuator. *Systems working on a local application principle apply an extinguishing agent directly onto a fire (usually a two dimensional area), or into the three dimensional region immediately surrounding the substance or object on fire. The main difference in local application from total flooding design is the absence of physical barriers enclosing the fire space. In the context of automatic extinguishing systems, local application generally refers to the use of systems that have been emplaced some time prior to their usage rather than the use of manually operated wheeled or portable fire extinguishers, although the nature of the agent delivery is similar and many automatic systems may also be activated manually. The lines are blurred somewhat with portable automatic extinguishing systems, although these are not common. ==Safety precautionsSuffocation=== Warning sign for fire suppression system An extinguishing system which is primarily based on inert gases in enclosed spaces presents a risk of suffocation. Some incidents have occurred where individuals in these spaces have been killed by carbon dioxide agent release (only in the case of CO2 carbon dioxide systems). When installed according to fire codes the systems have an excellent safety record. To prevent such occurrences, additional life safety systems are typically installed with a warning alarm that precedes the agent release. The warning, usually an audible and visible alert, advises the immediate evacuation of the enclosed space. After a preset time, the agent starts to discharge. This can be paused by activating an abort switch, which pauses the countdown as long as it is activated, allowing everyone to evacuate the area. Accidents have also occurred during maintenance of these systems, so proper safety precautions must be taken beforehand. ===Barotrauma=== Barotrauma is physical damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or in contact with the body, and the surrounding environment. The positive pressure caused by these gases may be sufficient to break windows and walls. Humans and structures must be adequately protected and ventilation/blow-off must be considered when designing the system. ==See also== * Fire protection * Hypoxic air technology for fire prevention * Inert Gas 451 - Inergen ==ReferencesExternal links== * Fire Suppression Systems Association * National Fire Protection Association * EPA U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Category:Active fire protection Category:Fire suppression Category:Firefighting equipment Category:Industrial gases ","title":"Gaseous fire suppression"},{"id":"2205198","text":"Tinotenda Mbiri Kanayi \\"Tino\\" Mawoyo (born 8 January 1986) is a Zimbabwean cricketer.

Brahms's ballades are arranged in two pairs of two, the members of each pair being in parallel keys. The first ballade was inspired by a Scottish poem \\"Edward\\" found in a collection Stimmen der Völker in ihren Liedern compiled by Johann Gottfried Herder. It is also one of the best examples of Brahms's bardic or Ossianic style; its open fifths, octaves, and simple triadic harmonies are supposed to evoke the sense of a mythological past. # D minor. Andante # D major. Andante # B minor. Intermezzo. Allegro # B major. Andante con moto The tonal center of each ballade conveys an interconnectedness between the four pieces: the first three each include the key signature of the ballade that follows it somewhere as a tonal center, and the fourth ends in the key signature of D major/B minor despite cadencing in B major. Brahms returned to the wordless ballade form in writing the third of the Six Pieces for Piano, Op. 118. His Op. 75 vocal duets titled \\"Ballads and Romances\\" include a setting of the poem \\"Edward\\"—the same that inspired Op. 10, No. 1\\\\. A number of famous pianists have played some or all of the Ballades, including Grigory Sokolov, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Artur Rubinstein, Emil Gilels, Sviatoslav Richter, Glenn Gould, Wilhelm Kempff, Idil Biret, Julius Katchen, Krystian Zimerman and Claudio Arrau. == References  External links == * *Brahms Ballade Op. 10 No. 1 on Classical Connect *Ballade \\"Edward\\" performed by Beau Pluto Category:Piano pieces by Johannes Brahms Category:1854 compositions Category:Piano ballades ","title":"Ballades, Op. 10 (Brahms)"},{"id":"2205218","text":"The Six Pieces for Piano, Op. 118, are some of the most beloved compositions that Johannes Brahms wrote for solo piano.

Rosa Luxemburg (1871–1919) of the Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania (Socjaldemokracja Królestwa Polskiego i Litwy, SDKPiL) party and the publicist Stanisław Brzozowski (1878–1911) were important early Polish Marxists. During the interwar period in the Second Polish Republic, some socialists formed the Communist Party of Poland (Komunistyczna Partia Polski, KPP). Most of the KPP's leaders and activists perished in the Soviet Union during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge in the 1930s, and the party was abolished by the Communist International (Comintern) in 1938. In 1939, World War II began and Poland was conquered by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The government of the Polish Republic went into exile. In 1942, Polish communists in German- occupied Poland established a new Polish communist party, the Polish Workers' Party (Polska Partia Robotnicza, PPR). Władysław Gomułka soon became its leader. But in the Soviet Union, Stalin and Wanda Wasilewska created the Union of Polish Patriots as a communist organization under Soviet control. As Germany was being defeated, the Polish communists cooperated with the Soviet Union, in opposition to the Polish government-in-exile, to establish a Soviet- dependent Polish state. This led to the creation of the Polish People's Republic. The PPR merged with the Polish Socialist Party (Polska Partia Socjalistyczna, PPS), to form the Polish United Workers' Party (Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza, PZPR), which ruled Poland until 1989. In post- World War II Poland, the communists initially enjoyed significant popular support due to the land reform, a mass scale rebuilding program and progressive social policies. The popular support eroded because of repressions, economic difficulties, and the lack of freedoms, but the PZPR was kept in power for four decades under the Soviet influence. During this period, some Polish academics and philosophers, including Leszek Kołakowski, Tadeusz Kotarbiński, Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz, and Stanisław Ossowski, tried to develop a form of \\"Polish Marxism\\", as part of the revisionist Marxist movement. These efforts to create a bridge between Poland's history and Marxist ideology were mildly successful, especially in comparison to similar attempts elsewhere in the Eastern Bloc. But they were stifled by the regime's unwillingness to risk stepping too far in the reformist direction. In post-1989 democratic Poland, declared communists have had a minimal impact on the political and economical life of the country. However, former communists, including members of the Politburo of the PZPR, remained active on the political scene after the transition to democracy. Some were democratically elected to top national leadership positions (e.g. Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who was a two-term president of the Polish Republic). Their center-left party, the Democratic Left Alliance (Sojusz Lewicy Demokratycznej, SLD), was one of the major political parties in Poland and was represented in the Sejm (Polish national parliament) until 2015. The influence of the so-called post-communists on the formation of the present democratic Constitution of Poland was essential. ==See also== *Anarchism in Poland *Solidarity (Polish trade union) ==References== *Keith John Lepak, Prelude to Solidarity, Columbia University Press, 1988, , p.19+ ==External links== *Polish Philosophy Page: The Marxist Trend, at the Internet Archive Category:History of Poland (1795–1918) Category:Second Polish Republic Category:Poland in World War II Category:Polish People's Republic ","title":"Communism in Poland"},{"id":"2205237","text":":Not to be confused with Paseas, the Ancient Greek vase painter.

His studies in the field of radiant heat led to him receiving the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society in 1868. In 1859 he was appointed director of Kew Observatory. He was elected professor of physics at Owens College, Manchester, and retained that chair until his death, which happened near Drogheda, in Ireland, on 19 December 1887. He was the author of several successful science textbooks, and also of the article on \\"Terrestrial Magnetism\\" in the ninth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. ==Career== Stewart was born on 1 November 1828 at 1 London Row in Leith (north of Edinburgh), the son of William Stewart a tea-merchant, and his wife, Jane Clouston.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1828 His father was involved in business in Great Britain and Australia. He was educated at Dundee. He then studied Physics at the University of St Andrews, and the University of Edinburgh. Following his studies of physics at Edinburgh, he became assistant to James David Forbes in 1856. Forbes was especially interested in questions of heat, meteorology, and terrestrial magnetism, and it was to these that Stewart also mainly devoted himself. Radiant heat first claimed his attention, and by 1858 he had completed his first investigations into the subject. These yielded a remarkable extension of Pierre Prévost's \\"Law of Exchanges,\\" and enabled him to establish the fact that radiation is not a surface phenomenon, but takes place throughout the interior of the radiating body, and that the radiative and absorptive powers of a substance must be equal, not only for the radiation as a whole, but also for every constituent of it. In recognition of this work he received in 1868 the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society, into which he had been elected six years before. Of other papers in which he dealt with this and kindred branches of physics may be mentioned \\"Observations with a Rigid Spectroscope,\\" \\"Heating of a Disc by Rapid Motion in Vacuo,\\" \\"Thermal Equilibrium in an Enclosure Containing Matter in Visible Motion,\\" and \\"Internal Radiation in Uniaxal Crystals.\\" In 1859 he was appointed director of Kew Observatory, and there naturally became interested in problems of meteorology and terrestrial magnetism. In 1870, the year in which he was very seriously injured in a railway accident, he was elected professor of physics at Owens College, Manchester, and retained that chair until his death, which happened near Drogheda, in Ireland, on 19 December 1887. He was the author of several successful textbooks of science, and also of the article on \\"Terrestrial Magnetism\\" in the ninth edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica. In conjunction with Professor P. G. Tait he wrote The Unseen Universe, at first published anonymously, which was intended to combat the common notion of the incompatibility of science and religion.Stewart, Balfour. The New International Encyclopedia (1905), vol. 18. A devoted churchman, Stewart was prominently identified with the Society for Psychical Research. It was in his 1875 review of The Unseen Universe, that William James first put forth his Will to Believe Doctrine. ==Stewart Super Flare== Balfour Stewart recorded remarkable geomagnetic disturbances on the evening of 28 August 1859 and the morning of 2 September 1859, at the Kew Observatory, and presented his findings in a paper presented to the Royal Society on 21 November 1861.On the Great Magnetic Disturbance of 28 August to 7 September 1859, as Recorded by Photography at the Kew Observatory. (Abstract) by Balfour Stewart, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 11, (1860–1862), pp. 407–410On the Great Magnetic Disturbance Which Extended from 28 August to 7 September 1859, as Recorded by Photography at the Kew Observatory by Balfour Stewart, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 151, (1861), pp. 423–430 He noted that while \\"magnetic disturbances of unusual violence and very wide extent\\" were recorded in various places around the world, the Kew Observatory had the benefit of self-recording magnetographs,An account of the construction of the self-recording magnetographs at present in operation at the Kew Observatory of the British Association. by Balfour Stewart, 1859; PDF Copy which allowed \\"the means of obtaining a continuous photographic register of the state of the three elements of the earth’s magnetic force—namely, the declination, and the horizontal and vertical intensity.\\" Stewart went on the make the following observation. > I now proceed to notice some of the peculiarities of this magnetic storm. > > It appears that we have two distinct well-marked disturbances, each > commencing abruptly and ending gradually, the first of which began on the > evening of August 28 and the second on the early morning of September 2\\\\. > These two great disturbances correspond therefore in point of time to the > two great auroral displays already alluded to. The second disturbance resulted from what is now known as the Carrington Super Flare, while the first disturbance is unnamed. As Stewart recorded and described this disturbance, this event will be referred to as the Stewart Super Flare in this discussion. At the 11 November 1859 meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society, Richard Carrington presented a paperDescription of a Singular Appearance seen in the Sun on 1 September 1859; Carrington, R.C.; Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 20, pp. 13–15 describing his observations of the super flare that occurred on 1 September, at 11:18 GMT and later named in his honor. In what appears to be an editorial addition made after the meeting the follow observation was appended in parenthesis. > (Mr. Carrington exhibited at the November Meeting of the Society a complete > diagram of the disk of the sun at the time, and copies of the photographic > records of the variations of the three magnetic elements, as obtained at > Kew, and pointed out that a moderate but very marked disturbance took place > at about 11h 20m A.M., Sept. 1st, of short duration; and that towards four > hours after midnight there commenced a great magnetic storm, which > subsequent accounts established to be considerable in the southern as in the > northern hemisphere. While the contemporary occurrence may deserve noting, > he would not have it supposed that he even leans towards hastily connecting > them. “One swallow does not make a summer.”) From this addendum, it is clear that Richard Carrington was not willing to commit professionally to connecting the magnetic disturbance with the event he had observed on the surface of the sun even though they occurred at nearly identical times. He had indeed displayed the magnetographs at the Royal Astronomical Society meeting. The time of 11:20 GMT is good agreement with other reports but the time of 4:00 GMT on 2 September 1859 for the commencement of the magnetic storm is an hour earlier than reported by Stewart. Stewart also reported on the magnetic disturbance that occurred at the same time as the event observed by Richard Carrington. > But, beside these two remarkable disturbances into which it divided itself, > this great storm comprehends a minor disturbance, not approaching these two > in extent, but yet possessing an interest peculiar to itself, which entitles > it to be mentioned. On September 1, a little before noon, Mr. R.C. > Carrington happened to be observing, by means of a telescope, a large spot > which might then be seen on the surface of our luminary, when a remarkable > appearance presented itself, which he described in a communications to the > Royal Astronomical Society. (Richard Carrington’s paper is then quoted at > length.) On calling at Kew Observatory a day or two afterwards, Mr. > Carrington learned that at the very moment when he had observed this > phenomena the three magnetic elements at Kew were simultaneously disturbed. > If no connexion had been known to subsist between these two classes of > phenomena, it would, perhaps, be wrong to consider this in any other light > than a casual coincidence; but since General Sabine has proved that a > relation subsists between magnetic disturbances and sun spots, it is not > impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken \\"in the act\\". > This disturbance occurred as nearly as possible at 11h 15m A.M. Greenwich > mean time, on September 1, 1859, affecting all the elements simultaneously, > and commencing quite abruptly. By citing the previous research of Edward Sabine, which established a correlation between sunspots and magnetic storms, Stewart was able to correctly advance the theory that the event observed by Richard Carrington and the magnetic disturbance that was recorded at the same time were in fact connected. The magnetic phenomena that occurred at about 11:18 GMT on 1 September 1859 are now known as a Solar Flare Effect (SFE) or a Magnetic Crochet, but the connection would not be proven for another 80 years.The 1859 Solar–Terrestrial Disturbance and the Current Limits of Extreme Space Weather Activity , Solar Physics (2004) 224: 407–422 (2005), E.W. Cliver and L. Svalgaard The SFE is a sudden ionosphere disturbances caused by soft X-rays and Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) driven enhancement of the ionosphere current vortices responsible for the regular daily variation observed on magnetometer traces. SFE are mostly observed in locations close to the sub-solar point (i.e. the point on earth when the sun is overhead) and can only be observed from stations in the sunlit hemisphere at the time of the solar flare. Using Stewart's times, the magnetic storm associated with the Carrington Super Flare took 17 hours and 45 minutes to reach the Earth. Stewart reported that the magnetic storm from the Stewart Super Flare, began at 22:30 GMT on the evening of 28 August 1859 as recorded by self-recording magnetographs at the Kew Observatory. Assuming that the transit time for the first super flare was the same as the second or 17 hours and 45 minutes, the Stewart Super Flare occurred at about 04:45 GMT on the morning of 28 August 1859. As the Solar Flare Effect can only be observed from the sunlit hemisphere the question becomes, what time was sunrise at the Kew Observatory on the morning of 28 August 1859? The coordinates for Kew Observatory are (51°29'N, 0°17'W). Using the US Naval Observatory \\"Sun or Moon Rise/Set Table for One Year\\" calculator, sunrise on the morning of 28 August 1859 sunrise was 05:06GMT. The Kew Observatory was still 21 minutes from sunrise and the Solar Flare Effect would not have been registered by the self-recording magnetographs at the Kew Observatory. Stewart did not publish the magnetograph records for the morning of 28 August 1859. While it is extremely unlikely, the original magnetograph records for that date should be inspected to determine if any disturbance was recorded because of the uncertainties in timings and the nearness of sunrise. In the time zone at GMT+7 it would have been 15 minutes to high noon on 28 August. Any observatory situated at plus or minus two time zones would have been in an excellent position to observe the super flare and record the magnetic signature of Solar Flare Effect. Unfortunately in 1859 the Kew Observatory had the only self-recording magnetographs. Other magnetic observatories were manually operated and typically only took readings at hourly intervals unless there was a magnetic storm, in which case readings were taken at 15-minute intervals. One such magnetic observatory was the Colaba Observatory on the Island of Colaba which is now part of Mumbai (Bombay), India at GMT+5.5. In a 2003 paperThe extreme magnetic storm of 1–2 September 1859 by BT Tsurutani, WD Gonzalez, GS Lakhina, S Alex; JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH, 2003 VOL. 108, NO. A7, 1268 the manually recorded magnetic readings from the Colaba Observatory for 1 September, through 2 September 1859 were recalibrated and evaluated. No mention is made in this paper of reading before 1 September or any visual observations of the sun. After 150 years it is very unlikely that any additional data will surface but any reports of strange events about noon Asian time on 28 August 1859 would be of interest. ==Writings== * Elementary Treatise on Heat (1866; sixth edition, revised, 1895) * Lessons in Elementary Physics (1871, 1886) * Physics (1872, 1884) * The Unseen Universe (1875) * Paradoxical Philosophy: A Sequel to the Unseen Universe (1878) * The Conservation of Energy (1875; ninth edition, 1900) * Lessons in Practical Physics with W.

The station has an English language news/talk radio format and identifies itself on-air as CJAD 800. Owned and operated by Bell Media, it has a daytime power of 50,000 watts but reduces power to 10,000 watts at night to avoid interfering with other stations on AM 800. The transmitter is located near Saint-Edouard, while studios and offices are located on Rene-Levesque Boulevard East in Downtown Montreal. CJAD can be heard across Canada on Bell Satellite TV channel 953. Local hosts are heard throughout the day and evening with a few syndicated shows also carried: Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Affiliated with CBS Radio for many years, in 2018 the station, along with many other Bell-owned talk radio stations in Canada, switched to NBC Radio and 24/7 News for U.S. and international news. CJAD and co-owned 690 CKGM are currently the only two full-time commercial English-language stations in Quebec on the AM dial. ==History== The CJAD studios in 1948 ===Early Years=== CJAD was founded by J.

In 1985, Standard was purchased by Slaight Communications, a privately held company owned by J. Allan Slaight. In 1962, sister station 95.9 CJFM was launched, with programming always separate from CJAD. ===Full Service Format=== For most of its history, CJAD had a full service format. The music was mainly middle of the road songs in the 1960s and 70s, switching to an adult contemporary sound by the 1980s. Two specialized shows were heard on weekends: \\"The Bandstand\\" with Dick Irvin Jr., and \\"Starlight Concert\\" with Rod Dewar. In 1995, CJAD shifted its format to full- time news/talk, dropping all music and entertainment, save for the Sunday morning Trivia Show and the CJAD Comedy Show, also heard on Sundays. Starting in 1992, almost all of CJAD's programming was simulcast on Corus Entertainment-owned AM 900 CKTS in Sherbrooke. On November 19, 2006, CKTS ceased broadcasting, signing off the transmitter and surrendering its licence to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). According to Corus, this was because of high ongoing maintenance costs that neither Corus nor Standard were willing to cover.CKTS to stop rebroadcasting CJAD, Corus press release, November 17, 2006 ===Ownership Changes=== In April 2007, Astral Media and Standard Broadcasting announced that Standard had agreed to sell CJAD and its other Montreal stations to Astral. On March 16, 2012, Bell Media announced that it had entered in an agreement to acquire Astral Media for an estimated value at $3.38 billion, with the deal including CJAD and its sister radio stations in Montreal. On Labour Day Weekend, 2012, CJAD, as well as its sister stations previously owned by Astral, moved from 1411 Fort Street to new facilities in the Bell Media Radio building on Rene- Levesque Boulevard East at Papineau Avenue. ===1998 Ice Storm=== In January 1998, all four of CJAD's broadcast towers toppled during The Ice Storm. CJAD's first attempt to get back on the air was to use CKGM's former AM 980 transmitter, re-tuned to the 800 frequency. This, however, turned out to be impossible as the 980 site was damaged by ice as well. CJAD then made arrangements to broadcast on CFMB's former 1410 transmitter, but the signal was poor to the west. CJAD management then reached an agreement with CHUM Limited to use their CKGM transmitter on 990 kHz until new towers were erected. ==News== A large part of CJAD800's daily programs are talk shows discussing local and international news. CJAD800 broadcasts newscasts every 30 minutes, except overnights when newscasts are delivered every hour, on the hour. Live @ Five is a half-hour news program broadcast at 5 a.m. on weekdays. Traffic updates air every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes late nights. On weekdays, veteran anchors Andrew Peplowski and Trudie Mason deliver morning newscasts, with Jason Mayoff and Richard Deschamps taking over in the afternoons. Kelly Lapare is the evening weekday anchor on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with Luciano Pipia delivering newscasts on Thursday and Friday evenings (Pipia is also CJAD's weekend afternoon anchor). Shawn Dearn serves as anchor on weekend mornings, and Benson Cook takes over from Pipia on Saturday and Sunday evenings. Overnight news is read during the week by James Foster, who is also a frequent fill-in at the morning anchor's desk. Longtime anchor and reporter Tom Armour retired in 2015.http://www.cjad.com/cjad- news/2015/05/02/long-time-cjad-broadcaster-tom-armour-retires Since October 2019, CJAD 800's daytime reporters are Elizabeth Zogalis and Shuyee Lee, with Lee also serving as the station's assignment editor. Weekend anchor Benson Cook also frequently does reporting work for the station. Some of the station's notable former reporters include Patrick Lejtenyi, Angelica Montgomery, Tina Tenneriello, Matthew Gilmour, Michel Boyer, Natalie Nanowski, Taylor C. Noakes, Andrew Brennan and Emily Campbell.https://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/tsn-690s-elliott- price-abe-hefter-among-bell-media-cuts-in-montreal ==Sports== CJAD is the exclusive English radio broadcaster of the CFL's Montreal Alouettes. Some game broadcasts are simulcast on sister station CHOM 97.7 FM. CJAD was the longtime English radio home of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team, until the 2010-11 season. In June 2010 it was announced that Canadiens broadcasts would switch to sports radio station CKGM, now on AM 690 and co-owned with CJAD. In July 2012, Bell Media, owners of CKGM, announced that English-language rights to the Canadiens could return to CJAD following its proposed acquisition of Astral Media, if its conversion of CKGM to a French-language sports station (which would have been done to satisfy ownership limits preventing the merged company from owning both CJAD and CKGM if they both broadcast in English) were approved by the CRTC. On October 18, 2012, the CRTC rejected Bell's proposal to acquire Astral Media; since the application to convert CKGM into a French station was contingent on the approval of the Astral merger, it too was rejected. On March 5, 2012, it was announced that CJAD would be the exclusive English language radio broadcaster of Montreal Impact soccer team for the next two years.http://www.impactmontreal.com/en/news/2012/03/montreal-impact- returns-cjad-800 Beginning in September 2013, CKGM (TSN 690) staffers began providing sports updates for co-owned CJAD. Until recently, Rick Moffat did the weekday morning sports, Mitch Gallo does the weekday afternoon sports, and Amanda Stein does the weekend morning sports for CJAD as well as TSN 690. ==Transmitter== CJAD broadcasts with 50,000 watts in the daytime, the maximum power permitted for Canadian AM stations. At night, power drops to 10,000 watts to avoid interfering with other stations using the 800 frequency, such as the country music-formatted CJBQ in Belleville, Ontario, the now-dark CHRC in Quebec City (which is approximately 250 miles [160 km] away and was shut down in September 2012), and CKLW in Windsor, Ontario. CJAD must also protect the Class A station on AM 800, XEROK in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, Mexico. CJAD's antenna is a four-tower array, located near Saint-Edouard, using two different directional patterns for day and night. 2007-2011 used until Aaron Rand returned to the station. During the Standard Radio era from 2002-2007, the words inside the red rectangles were in black. ==References* Jad Jad Jad Category:Radio stations established in 1945 Jad Category:1945 establishments in Quebec ","title":"CJAD"},{"id":"2205277","text":"Preservation Hall Jazz Band is a New Orleans jazz band founded in New Orleans by tuba player Allan Jaffe in the early 1960s. The band derives its name from Preservation Hall in the French Quarter. In 2005, the Hall's doors were closed for a period of time due to Hurricane Katrina, but the band continued to tour. ==Early years== In the 1950s, Larry Borenstein, an art dealer from Milwaukee, managed Preservation Hall in the French Quarter as an art gallery. To attract customers, he invited local New Orleans jazz musicians to play. After their honeymoon in 1961, Allan Jaffe and his wife Sandra visited to hear some traditional New Orleans jazz. The Jaffes were from Pennsylvania. Allan Jaffe was a tuba player who had graduated from the Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia, while his wife had been employed at an advertising agency. They attended concerts, grew to love the French Quarter, and stayed longer than they had intended. Borenstein asked if they wanted to manage Preservation Hall, and they agreed. Allan Jaffe hired local musicians whose ages ranged from the 60s to the 90s. Many were struggling with poverty, racism, and illness. At first the Jaffes served no alcohol, used no amplification, and didn't advertise. In 1963, Allan Jaffe began to tour with bands in the U.S. and in other countries. These tours included such popular figures as pianist Sweet Emma Barrett, trumpeter Kid Thomas Valentine, brothers Percy Humphrey and Willie Humphrey, trumpeter De De Pierce and his wife, pianist Billie Pierce. The most popular was clarinetist George Lewis, whose reputation preceded the Hall. Fans from all over the world came to New Orleans to hear traditional jazz. ==Olympia Brass Band== Barrett's health began to decline in the 1970s, which forced her to stop touring. She was replaced as leader by brothers Percy Humphrey (trumpet) and Willie Humphrey (clarinet). The lineup included Frank Demond (trombone), James Prevost (bass), James \\"Sing\\" Miller (piano), Cie Frazier (drums), Jim Robinson (trombone), Narvin Kimball (banjo), and Allan Jaffe (tuba). During the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of the touring members were hired by Harold Dejan for his Olympia Brass Band. This band became not only a staple at Preservation Hall, but also influenced the Preservation Hall Jazz Band and future Preservation Hall musicians. Dejan's regular sidemen included Andy Anderson (trumpet), Milton Batiste (trumpet), Kid Sheik Cola (trumpet), Paul Crawford (trombone) Gerald Joseph (trombone), Emanuel Paul (tenor saxophone), Andrew Jefferson (snare), John Smith, Henry \\"Booker T\\" Glass, Nowell \\"Papa\\" Glass. Cag Cagnolatti, Kid Thomas Valentine, Louis Nelson, Louis Cottrell, Jr., Cié Frazier, Emanuel Sayles, and Allan Jaffe on tuba were among those who played with the group. During the Olympia years, a young Harry Connick Jr. performed with Barrett and the band at Preservation Hall. In 1977, Jaffe and Arthur Hall and his Afro-American Dance Ensemble released Fat Tuesday and All That Jazz! A Mardi Gras Dance Musical. The world premiere of the dance musical was on February 19, 1977, and was followed by a tour in the United States. Dejan's Olympia Brass Band was featured in Fat Tuesday and All That Jazz, in addition to the Arthur Hall Afro-American Dance Ensemble of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ==Continuing a tradition== In 1987, Allan Jaffe died of cancer at the age of fifty-one. After his son Ben graduated from Oberlin College, he became artistic director in 1993. Ben Jaffe toured with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, playing double bass and tuba. He began the educational initiatives that his father developed. \\"As many as 20 different bands, drawn from a pool of about 150 local musicians, had played at Preservation Hall in the 1960s, but by 1999 virtually all of the older generation of musicians had died and the band members were a mixture of younger African-American players and white musicians from overseas. Most notable among the former were Michael White (ii), Wendell Brunious (who gradually took over the leadership of Valentine's band in the elder trumpeter's final years, as well as the touring band), Freddie Lonzo, and the tuba player Walter Payton; Europeans included the Swedish pianist Lars Edegran, the English trumpeter Clive Wilson, Orange Kellin, and Jacques Gauthé\\" (Hazeldine, Kernfeld). The Preservation Hall Jazz Band continued to tour nationally and internationally. The band was led by trumpeter Wendell Brunious, later replaced by his older brother, John Brunious. In 2006, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band was awarded the National Medal of Arts, the nation's highest honor for artistic excellence. The award was presented Benjamin Jaffe and co-founder of Preservation Hall, Sandra Jaffe, who accepted the award from President and Mrs. Laura Bush in an Oval Office ceremony on November 9, 2006. The citations read: \\"With enormous talent and pride, this ageless ensemble has toured the world displaying the unbreakable spirit of New Orleans and sharing the joy of New Orleans jazz with us all.\\" Nearing Preservation Hall's 45th anniversary, the band collaborated with musicians from other genres, such as Blind Boys of Alabama on their Grammy Award winning album, Down in New Orleans. The band's benefit album in 2010 contained contributions from Andrew Bird, Del McCoury Band, Jim James, Dr. John, Pete Seeger, and Tom Waits. The Hall band supported My Morning Jacket on tour. The album American Legacies was a collaboration with the Del McCoury band, uniting New Orleans jazz and bluegrass music. In 2014, The Preservation Hall Jazz Band made a guest appearance on the Foo Fighters' eighth studio album Sonic Highways. The Trey McIntyre Project dance ensemble collaborated with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band to create Ma Maison and The Sweeter End, two contemporary dance works set. The two ensembles toured numerous dates nationally, including performances at the Hollywood Bowl and the Lincoln Center. ==50th anniversary== Preservation Hall celebrated its Golden Anniversary from 2011 to 2012. Projects included: * 50th Anniversary Concert at Carnegie Hall with Allen Toussaint, Frank Demond, Yasiin Bey, Givers, Steve Earle * Art and Jazz: Preservation Hall at 50 at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art. * Opened the Preservation Hall at 50 exhibition at the Old US Mint in New Orleans. * Performed at New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, with Bonnie Raitt, Jim James, Allen Toussaint, Steve Earle, Rebirth Brass Band. * The Hall band became the first to perform at both the Newport Jazz Festival and the Newport Folk Festival in the same year. * Two albums were released: Preservation Hall Jazz Band 50th Anniversary Collection (Sony Legacy) and St. Peter & 57th St. (Rounder) a recording of the 50th Anniversary concert at Carnegie Hall entitled ==Awards== * 2006 National Medal of Arts * 2013 NAACP Image Award for Preservation Hall Jazz Band 50th Anniversary Collection ==Members== * Ben Jaffe – double bass, tuba * Charlie Gabriel – saxophone, clarinet * Walter Harris – drums * Ronell Johnson – trombone * Branden Lewis – trumpet * Clint Maedgen – saxophone * Kyle Roussel – piano Past members * Lucien Barbarin – trombone * Paul Barbarin – drums * Sweet Emma Barrett – piano * John Brunious – trumpet * Wendell Brunious – trumpet * Albert Burbank – clarinet * Raymond Burke – clarinet * Maynard Chatters – trombone * Paul Crawford - trombone, baritone horn * Manny Crusto – clarinet * Frank Demond – trombone * Lars Edegran – piano * Frank Fields – bass * Cie Frazier – drummer * Percy Humphrey – trumpet * Willie Humphrey – clarinet * Allan Jaffe – tuba * Ralph H.

It is privately owned but open to the public. Although the site's use by the College students dates back to at least the 1860s, the Arboretum began in 1922 when Mr. and Mrs. George A. Slayton donated 14 acres (5.7 hectares) to Hillsdale College. By 1924, the first donated plantings were in place, led by Professor Bertram A. Barber. A pond was excavated in 1928, and a field station, a hillside rock garden, waterfall, and pump house were added in 1929. In the early 1930s two bridges were added, and an amphitheater built in the late 1930s on the site of a former gravel pit. leftOn October 17, 1999 the Arboretum was the site of a suicide or murder when Lissa Jackson Roche, the managing editor of Hillsdale College Press, was found dead of a gunshot wound after claiming that she and her father-in-law, the college's president, had been involved in a nineteen-year extramarital affair. The initial period of development of Slayton Arboretum under Professor Barber resulted in an intimate botanical garden much loved by students and alumni of Hillsdale College as well as the residents of Hillsdale. It was the focal point for student outdoor activity in biology and ecology. The rock gardens, waterfalls, gazebos, amphitheater and rustic cement bridges have survived virtually intact. The arboretum occupies the site of a disused gravel pit, and it is the distinct topography of the site along with the coniferous trees planted during Barber's directorship that provide the garden with its special charm. These original plantings matured over forty years of benign neglect following the demise of Professor Barber. In the early 1990s the arboretum was re-discovered as an important asset to the college and recovery of the site was begun under the direction of Dr. David Crabtree. Alumni and student support for the renewal of plantings and the conservation of the original structural elements was important in the restoration of the gardens during this time period. Today the gardens are notable for stately mature trees, semi-natural settings, and collections of conifers, magnolia, viburnum, witchhazel, mountain ash, maple, oak, and hickory as well as several genera of hardy deciduous shrubs. The site is of considerable interest to ecologists in that several species of exotic woody shrubs have naturalized in the area to the exclusion of the native woody flora. The exotic shrubs that have become rampant are common buckthorn and common privet. Preferential deer herbivory of native species seems to be the primary cause of this invasion, and a deer exclusion has been attempted. The arboretum also has heavy and repeated infestation with Japanese beetle and this may also play a role in the dynamics of the shrub community which has developed in the garden over the last seventy years. The arboretum is currently directed by Dr. Ranessa Cooper and hosts art programs and children's programs during the summer. As of late 2013 the arboretum underwent a renovation. The college has added a waterfall and the arboretum is open to the public once again. == See also == * List of botanical gardens in the United States == External links == *Hillsdale Arboretum Category:Arboreta in Michigan Category:Botanical gardens in Michigan Category:Protected areas of Hillsdale County, Michigan Category:Hillsdale College Category:Protected areas established in 1922 Category:1922 establishments in Michigan ","title":"Slayton Arboretum"},{"id":"2205287","text":"Little Placentia Sound is a small natural bay (sound) located within Placentia Bay on the Avalon Peninsula of the island of Newfoundland, in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.

He studied politology and sociology in Marburg and Berlin, worked for five years as reporter for taz before coming to Stern in 1993 – first in Bonn, from 1999 to 2004 in Brussels, today in Berlin. In 2005, he received the Leipziger Medienpreis for his EU reporting. He was the most efficient in exposing Eurostat scandal, the EU statistical body based in Luxembourg. Working for German news magazine Stern, for months he wrote his successive findings and Stern magazine published his revelations about hidden accounts and fictitious contracts. Until May 16, 2003 when Financial Times headlines revealed \\"A vast enterprise for looting community funds\\". Two top French managers were removed from office and the whole Eurostat directorate was dismissed. Six separate fraud investigations into Eurostat were required by OLAF, the EU anti-fraud body. Subsequently Hans- Martin Tillack was arrested by Belgian police at the instigation of authorities of the European Union, whose bodies he was investigating in relation to allegations of fraud. OLAF suggested that the reporter had bribed EU officials in order to gather documents for an article he published in 2002 on alleged irregularities in OLAF. An action by Belgian police followed that resulted in the journalist being detained by the police for several hours, his home and office being searched, and possessions including 16 boxes of documents, two archive boxes, two computers and four mobile phones being seized. In 2007, the European Court of Human Rights judged that Hans-Martin Tillack's right not to reveal his sources of information had been violated and asked Belgium to pay him €10,000 for moral damages as well as €30,000 in costs. The hundreds of pages of seized documents were eventually returned to him in 2008. In January 2009, the Belgian judiciary on Tuesday definitively closed the case brought by the EU anti-fraud office, OLAF, in 2004 against Hans-Martin Tillack. Aidan White, general secretary of the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ) which supported Mr Tillack throughout the case, argued the need for EU officials to apologise to the journalist. ==Books== * Die korrupte Republik: Über die einträgliche Kungelei von Politik, Bürokratie und Wirtschaft (The corrupt Republic: Lucrative fiddling of politics, bureaucracy and economy), by Hans-Martin Tillack, Hoffmann und Campe, 2009 * Raumschiff Brüssel.

The film is an adaptation of the ancient Arabic anthology The Book of One Thousand and One Nights, better known as The Arabian Nights. It is the last of Pasolini's \\"Trilogy of Life\\", which began with The Decameron and continued with The Canterbury Tales. The lead was played by young Franco Merli who was discovered for this film by Pasolini. The film contains abundant nudity, sex and slapstick humor. It preserves the eroticism and the story within a story structure of Arabian Nights and has been called \\"perhaps the best and certainly the most intelligent\\" of Arabian Nights film adaptations. ==Plot== The main story concerns an innocent young man, Nur-e-Din (Franco Merli), who comes to fall in love with a beautiful slave girl, Zumurrud (Ines Pellegrini), who selected him as her master. After a foolish error of his causes her to be abducted, he travels in search of her. Meanwhile, Zumurrud manages to escape and, disguised as a man, comes to a far-away kingdom where she becomes king. Various other travellers recount their own tragic and romantic experiences, including a young man who becomes enraptured by a mysterious woman on his wedding day, and a man who is determined to free a woman from a demon (Franco Citti).

It advocated Breton nationalism through \\"direct action\\" and published a secret manual aimed at instructing readers in terrorism. The phrase \\"Gwenn ha du\\" is the nickname for the Breton flag, which is in these colours. ==HistoryStatue bombing=== In July 1932, Gwenn ha Du decided to destroy a monument it found particularly offensive: a statue created by Jean Boucher marking the union of Brittany and France in 1532. Its unveiling some twenty years earlier triggered the first protest by Breton Nationalists. Célestin Lainé made a bomb in his bedroom, consisting of a condensed milk carton filled with nitroglycerine. In the early hours of August 7, he set the bomb behind the head of the King of France's statue in the facade opposite the mayor's office. At 4:00 a.m., the bomb detonated, shattering the bronze statue and all glass within 100 metres. On August 7, the group claimed responsibility for the attack, which was intended to coincide with the 400th anniversary celebration of the union, taking place in Vannes under the guidance of French prime minister Édouard Herriot. L'Humanité, the French Communist Party newspaper, spoke out the day after, protesting that Herriot didn't mention that all Celtic civilisation was wiped out, the refusal to acknowledge the Breton language and culture. The authorities arrested six militants on August 11; the six remained imprisoned for fifty days. ===Later attacks=== The Gwenn ha du, which presented itself as the unofficial military wing of the Parti National Breton, followed up with a few months of action. On November 20, Gwenn ha du members detonated a bomb on the railway line between Ingrandes and Champtocé, not long before Édouard Herriot's arrival there. The train stopped in front of the damaged rails. However, Herriot eventually got to Nantes in time to celebrate the act of the Union between Brittany and France. Three more attacks followed: April 13, 1936, with arson in four préfectures; December 18, 1938, with the blowing up of a monument (the Monument de la Fédération bretonne-angevine in Pontivy); and the attack in the préfecture of Quimper on February 28, 1939. ===Dissolution=== A last attack was suspected on 13th of May 1941 against Carhaix gendarmerie station after a statement was sent to members of the National Council in Vichy, threatening more attacks if the borders of the traditional province of Brittany were not recognised. After this the group ceased to function, its members becoming part of various milice groups working with the German occupying forces. Lainé himself led the Bezen Perrot militia, which included former Gwenn ha du activists. After the war, surviving members were either captured or fled France. Some were later associated with the Liberation Front of Brittany, which was active in the 1960s. ==Members of Gwenn ha du== *Célestin Lainé *Francis Bayer du Kern *Meavenn (pseudonym) *Hervé Le Helloco *Guillaume Berthou *Théophile Jeusset *Augustin Catelliot Category:Breton nationalism Category:Terrorism in France Category:Paramilitary organizations based in France ","title":"Gwenn ha du (Breton paramilitary group)"},{"id":"2205322","text":"Gianpiero Combi (; 20 November 1902 – 12 August 1956) was an Italian footballer who played as a goalkeeper.Special on the Azzurri - the greatest: Gianpiero Combi - www.figc.it He spent his entire club career at Juventus, where he won five Italian League titles.

Around the beginning of 1934, 31-year-old Gianpiero Combi was preparing to retire from football. In this season he was on the way to winning his fifth Italian championship (a record fourth in a row) with Juventus and he had played more than 40 games for the national team. A new promising young goalkeeper was emerging: Carlo Ceresoli, who played for Inter. On his debut Ceresoli had helped the national team to qualify for the 1934 World Cup which was held in Italy that summer, by eliminating Greece in Milano by a 4–0 win. But the National Coach Vittorio Pozzo included Combi in the Italian squad - he was also one of the Nazio-Juve members - and was asked by Pozzo to postpone his retirement until the end of the tournament as his experience might be a great help. During a training session a few weeks before the beginning of the tournament, a shot by Pietro Arcari broke one of Ceresoli's forearms. This forced him to miss the World Cup and Combi again found himself the top goalkeeper in Italy, with the responsibility of leading the Azzurri to their debut in football's premier competition. The first match was on 27 May 1934 when Italy played the first round of the World Cup in the Stadio Nazionale of the P.N.F. in Rome against the United States. The Azzurri beat their opponents 7–1, a victory provided by a hat trick from Angelo Schiavio, a double from Raimundo Orsi and a goal each from Giovanni Ferrari and Meazza. In the Quarter-finals the Italians met Spain, who were led by another great goalkeeper of the time, Ricardo Zamora. The game was played on 31 May 1934 in the Stadio Comunale \\"Giovanni Berta\\" of Florence. The game against the Spanish team was a very difficult one, dominated by the speed and force used by both teams and finished in a 1–1 draw after extra time. A replay had to be played the next day, in which Italy changed four players and Spain seven. Italy won 1–0 with a goal by Meazza. Pozzo, Monzeglio, Bertolini, Combi, Monti (half-hidden) and the assistant manager Carcano (behind) before the start of extra time in the victorius final versus Czechoslovakia. Their semi-final opponents were the Austrian Wunderteam, the squad who had beaten the Italians 4–2 in Turin four months earlier. The match was played in Milano's Stadio Calcistico San Siro on 3 June and the Azzurri won 1–0 with a goal by Enrico Guaita. Combi was also decisive when he made two miraculous saves to keep the score in favor of Italy until the end. The final was held in Rome on 10 June 1934 against Czechoslovakia. The first half finished without a goal but in the 71st minute, against all odds, Antonin Puč managed to beat the Italian goalkeeper. Ten minutes later Orsi equalized and the game went to extra-time. With the help of a noisy support, so great that the rival coach Pozzo had to continually run along the pitch so that the players could hear his instructions, Italy won the match through a goal by Schiavio and the Italian team were crowned World Champions. Gianpiero Combi, who played 510 minutes and conceded three goals as captain of the squad, received the Jules Rimet trophy from the Italian Dictator Benito Mussolini. 1934 Italia: 10 June 1934, the final match (chapter ten) - www.storiedicalcio.altervista.org == End of career and retirement == A year later, in November 1935, Combi played only five of the eight matches in the International Cup and in his absence the Italian team won the trophy. He totalled 47 caps for the Italian team, 5 of which were as captain. Although he had stopped playing football, his passion for the sport remained all his life and he still held a number of unofficial positions with Juventus. He offered advice to the technical staff and also served as a scout. In 1951 the Italian Football Federation offered him the job of technical commissioner for the Italian national team with Carlino Beretta and Toni Busini. They led the National Team for seven months, from 8 April to 25 November 1951 in which time the Italian squad played 5 games without any losses. They won 4–1 against Portugal and France, and drew against Yugoslavia (0–0), Sweden (1–1) and Switzerland (1–1) - the only competitive game of the five. He died in Imperia on 12 August 1956, aged 53. == Style of play == Combi in action with Bianconeri in 1928 Despite his relatively small stature for a player in his position, Combi was a commanding keeper, who possessed notable strength, which he combined with his elegance, agility, intelligence, shot- stopping ability, positional sense, and excellent technique; throughout his career, he stood out in particular due to his consistency, efficient goalkeeping style, and composure, rather than flamboyance, even though he was capable of producing spectacular diving saves when necessary. He is regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time. == Records == * Combi is the first goalkeeper to win four Italian Championships in a row.From 1930–31 season to 1934–35 season.
